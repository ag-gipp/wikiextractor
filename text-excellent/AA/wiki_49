Geoffrey (archbishop of York)

Geoffrey (<a href="circa">c.</a> 1152 – 12 December 1212) was an illegitimate son of <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>, <a href="English%20monarchy">King</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>, who became <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">bishop-elect</a> of <a href="diocese%20of%20Lincoln">Lincoln</a> and <a href="archbishop%20of%20York">archbishop of York</a>. The identity of his mother is uncertain, but she may have been named Ykenai. Geoffrey held several minor clerical offices before becoming Bishop of Lincoln in 1173, though he was not <a href="ordination">ordained</a> as a <a href="Priesthood%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">priest</a> until 1189. In 1173–1174, he led a campaign in northern England to help put down a rebellion by his legitimate half-brothers; this campaign led to the capture of <a href="William%20the%20Lion">William</a>, <a href="King%20of%20Scots">King of Scots</a>. By 1182, Pope <a href="Pope%20Lucius%20III">Lucius III</a> had ordered that Geoffrey either resign Lincoln or be <a href="consecration%20of%20a%20bishop">consecrated</a> as bishop; he chose to resign and became <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Chancellor</a> instead. He was the only one of Henry II's sons present at the king's death.

Geoffrey's half-brother <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a> nominated him archbishop of York after succeeding to the throne of England, probably to force him to become a priest and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. After some dispute Geoffrey was consecrated archbishop in 1191. He soon became embroiled in a conflict with <a href="William%20Longchamp">William Longchamp</a>, Richard's regent in England, after being detained at Dover on his return to England following his consecration in France. Geoffrey claimed <a href="sanctuary">sanctuary</a> in the town, but he was seized by agents of Longchamp and briefly imprisoned in <a href="Dover%20Castle">Dover Castle</a>. Subsequently, a council of magnates ordered Longchamp out of office, and Geoffrey was able to proceed to his archdiocese. The archbishop spent much of his archiepiscopate in various disputes with his half-brothers: first Richard and then <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">John</a>, who succeeded to the English throne in 1199. Geoffrey also quarrelled with his <a href="suffragan%20bishop">suffragan bishop</a>s, his <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a>, and other clergy in his <a href="Archdiocese%20of%20York">diocese</a>. His last quarrel with John was in 1207, when the archbishop refused to allow the collection of a tax and was driven into exile in France. He died there five years later.

Geoffrey was probably born in about 1152, before his father Henry, later Henry II of England, married <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>, and was likely named after his paternal grandfather, <a href="Geoffrey%20Plantagenet%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey of Anjou</a>. Although he is often given the surname "Plantagenet" in modern histories, that name was not in use during his lifetime. The date of his birth is determined by statements of <a href="Gerald%20of%20Wales">Gerald of Wales</a> that he was barely 20 when elected bishop in 1173, and by the fact that he was about 40 when consecrated archbishop in 1191. His mother's identity is unclear. The medieval chronicler <a href="Walter%20Map">Walter Map</a> claimed she was a whore named Ykenai, and that he was not actually Henry's son. This is the only contemporary source that gives her name, and as Map was hostile to Geoffrey, the information must be judged carefully. Instead, Ykenai may have been a daughter of a knight. Another possibility for Geoffrey's mother is <a href="Rosamund%20Clifford">Rosamund Clifford</a>, but most of the evidence for this is circumstantial. It is assumed that Geoffrey was the eldest of Henry's children, legitimate or illegitimate.

Geoffrey was brought up with Henry's legitimate children. There is no evidence that Henry tried to deny Geoffrey's paternity, although Walter Map said that Henry's acknowledgment was done "improperly and with little discretion". Geoffrey had a brother named Peter, who appears to have been his maternal half-brother, as Peter is generally considered unlikely to have been Henry's son.

Geoffrey was <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Lincoln">Archdeacon of Lincoln</a> in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Lincoln">diocese of Lincoln</a> by September 1171, and probably retained that office until he was confirmed as bishop-elect in 1175. He also held a <a href="prebendary">prebend</a>, an income from land owned by a cathedral chapter, in the <a href="diocese%20of%20London">diocese of London</a>, but there is little evidence that he executed the duties of either office. There are some indications that he studied <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> at a school in <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a>, and that he taught in Paris during the early 1170s. He also acted as a <a href="papal%20judge-delegate">papal judge-delegate</a> at that time. Pope <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Alexander III</a> initially refused to confirm Geoffrey's selection as Bishop of Lincoln in about May 1173, prompting Geoffrey to travel to Rome in October 1174 to secure confirmation of this office. He was confirmed in the office of bishop by July 1175, but he was not <a href="ordination">ordained</a> at that time, as he was under the canonical age for holding a bishopric. Geoffrey's youth was one of Alexander's objections to Geoffrey's election, and the pope only confirmed the office under duress. Another potential problem was Geoffrey's illegitimacy, which normally disbarred a person from holding ecclesiastical office, but that was dealt with by the granting of a papal dispensation.

In 1173 and early 1174 Geoffrey fought a military campaign in northern England in support of his father's attempts to subdue the Scots, who were supporting the <a href="Revolt%20of%201173%E2%80%931174">rebellion</a> by Geoffrey's legitimate half-brothers against their father. The campaign resulted in the capture of <a href="William%20the%20Lion">William the Lion</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20Scottish%20monarchs">King of Scots</a>, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alnwick%20%281174%29">Battle of Alnwick</a> and also helped to compel <a href="Hugh%20de%20Puiset">Hugh du Puiset</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, to pledge fealty to Henry II. During the campaign, Geoffrey captured several castles held by <a href="Roger%20de%20Mowbray%20%28Lord%20of%20Montbray%29">Roger Mowbray</a>, a supporter of the Scottish king. It was after this campaign that Henry said of Geoffrey "My other sons are the real bastards. ... This is the only one who's proved himself legitimate!" After Geoffrey was confirmed as bishop by Pope Alexander in 1175, the bishop-elect made a ceremonial visit to Lincoln on 1 August 1175. He subsequently went to study at <a href="Tours">Tours</a>, where he probably befriended <a href="Peter%20of%20Blois">Peter of Blois</a>, a medieval poet and diplomat who dedicated a later work on St <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a> to Geoffrey. The bishop-elect made several gifts to the cathedral at Lincoln, including two bells for the bell tower. While Geoffrey was the bishop-elect at Lincoln, it appears that <a href="Adam%20Parvipontanus">Adam, Bishop of St Asaph</a>, carried out the episcopal duties in the diocese of Lincoln, as Geoffrey had not been <a href="consecration">consecrated</a> and was unable to perform those functions. Nevertheless, he managed to recover some lands of the diocese that had been lost as well as redeeming pawned ecclesiastical items. Although he aided the finances of his diocese with these recoveries, in 1180 he taxed his diocese heavily enough to earn him a rebuke from his father. In 1181 Pope Lucius III became concerned that Geoffrey was never going to be ordained or consecrated, and demanded that the bishop-elect's position be regularised, either through consecration as bishop or through resignation.

Geoffrey formally resigned the see of Lincoln on 6 January 1182, at <a href="Marlborough%2C%20Wiltshire">Marlborough</a> in England, rather than be ordained as Pope Lucius III had ordered. Henry had named him <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Chancellor</a> of England in 1181, after Geoffrey indicated he was going to resign the bishopric in February 1181. Although Geoffrey resigned the episcopal office, he continued to hold <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s in <a href="Benefice%23Pluralism">plurality</a>, which was normally contrary to canon law. These offices included the <a href="Treasurer%20of%20York">Treasurer of York</a> from 1182, the Archdeaconry of Rouen from 1183, and probably the <a href="Archdeaconry%20of%20East%20Riding">Archdeaconry of East Riding</a>. Henry also gave him two continental castles, one in Anjou and one in Touraine, along with lands in England and Normandy worth 1000 <a href="mark%20%28money%29">marks</a> a year. Although Geoffrey held the office of Chancellor, he appears in only few documents, mainly between 1182 and 1185. After 1185 he does not appear in any contemporary documents until 1187, and it is possible that he spent some time outside his father's domains. Peter of Blois wrote that several monarchs considered Geoffrey as a possible successor for their kingdoms in Italy or the Holy Land, and that he was actually offered the throne of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> by <a href="Patriarch%20Heraclius%20of%20Jerusalem">Heraclius</a>, the <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Patriarch of Jerusalem</a>. It is possible that Geoffrey's non-appearance in documents was due to his absence from his father's domains in pursuit of these ambitions. During Geoffrey's term of office as Chancellor <a href="Walter%20de%20Coutances">Walter de Coutances</a> served as his "seal-keeper"; the need for someone to perform this function adds further evidence to the likelihood that Geoffrey's time as Chancellor was spent on unrelated duties for his father. <a href="William%20Longchamp">William Longchamp</a> fulfilled the same assistant role for the archdeaconry at Rouen.

Following the declaration of war on Henry by Prince <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard</a> and King <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip II of France</a> in 1187, Geoffrey was given command of a quarter of the English royal army. He and his father were driven from <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a>, Henry's birthplace, in 1189. Geoffrey did not attend the subsequent conference at which Henry submitted to Philip immediately before Henry's death, unwilling to witness his father's humiliation, but he did help nurse him during his final days. Henry made a bedside wish that Geoffrey be made either Archbishop of York or <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, and Geoffrey used his father's seal to make appointments to York after Henry's death. Geoffrey then escorted Henry's body to <a href="Fontevrault%20Abbey">Fontevrault Abbey</a> for burial. He was the only one of Henry II's sons present at his death.

Richard named Geoffrey Archbishop of York on 20 July 1189, within days of taking the throne; the formal election took place on 10 August. What happened with the vacant archbishopric of York after Richard took the throne, and why, as well as the exact chronology of events, is complicated by the contradictory nature of the main contemporary accounts. Gerald of Wales states that Geoffrey was reluctant to accept York, but another chronicler, <a href="Benedict%20of%20Peterborough">Benedict of Peterborough</a> relates that Geoffrey quickly took control of the archiepiscopal estates. However the election occurred, Geoffrey's consecration did not take place until much later, and soon after his election, he either resigned or was stripped of his office of Chancellor. A further complication was that the cathedral chapter had earlier elected the <a href="Dean%20of%20York">Dean of York</a>, <a href="Hubert%20Walter">Hubert Walter</a>, as archbishop.

Richard probably gave York to Geoffrey in the hope of forcing him to become a full priest, and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. Richard also required Geoffrey to swear that he would remain outside England for three years during the time Richard expected to be out of the country on crusade. The king subsequently released Geoffrey from the oath, the initial swearing of which was apparently another of Richard's efforts to keep Geoffrey's possible ambitions towards the English throne in check. But the cathedral chapter at York disputed Geoffrey's appointment, claiming that because the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, and some others of the chapter had not been present, the election was invalid. Walter's election to York was supported by Richard's mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom a chronicler claimed hated Geoffrey as the product of one of her husband's affairs. Richard consequently retained his control over the estates of the archbishopric, and did not confirm the election until a council held at <a href="Pipewell">Pipewell</a> on 16 September. At that council Richard also appointed three men to offices within the <a href="diocese%20of%20York">diocese of York</a>: he made <a href="Henry%20Marshal%20%28bishop%20of%20Exeter%29">Henry Marshal</a> the dean; <a href="Burchard%20du%20Puiset">Burchard du Puiset</a>, a relative of Hugh du Puiset, became treasurer; and <a href="Roger%20of%20London">Roger of London</a> the abbot of <a href="Selby%20Abbey">Selby Abbey</a>. Geoffrey objected to these appointments, and as a result his estates were confiscated by the king until he submitted and became a priest. The historians Ralph Turner and Richard Heiser speculate that Richard's strategy in making these appointments was to keep Geoffrey distracted by problems within his diocese, and thus unable to challenge for the English throne. The two historians also suggest that Richard may have been making an example of Geoffrey, in a demonstration that he could be harsh even with his own relatives.

Geoffrey's ordination as a priest took place at <a href="Southwell%2C%20Nottinghamshire">Southwell</a> on 23 September 1189, in a ceremony performed by <a href="John%20of%20Whithorn">John</a> the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Whithorn">Bishop of Whithorn</a>. Geoffrey then went to York, but until his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office. This stance was supported by most of the York cathedral chapter. Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury. It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey's election was secured in December, when <a href="Giovanni%20Conti%20d%27Anagni">Giovanni d'Anagni</a>, the <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>, not only confirmed the election, but rejected the various appeals made by the cathedral chapter against Geoffrey. But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments, and pay a fine of £2000 before his lands were restored, although Geoffrey was allowed some time to make the full payment.

In early 1190 Geoffrey ordered a halt to religious ceremonies in the cathedral and excommunicated Henry Marshal and Burchard in retaliation for a dispute during an earlier church service. Richard, who was in Normandy preparing to go on the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a>, ordered Geoffrey to the king's presence in Normandy. Although Hugh du Puiset, who was <a href="Justiciar">Justiciar</a>, was hampering Geoffrey's attempts to collect revenue for the earlier fine, Richard insisted on immediate full payment. When Geoffrey was unable to pay Richard re-confiscated his lands, increased the amount of the fine, and demanded a promise that Geoffrey would not visit England for three years. The dispute was settled once more when the pope stepped in and ratified Geoffrey's election, thus enabling a reconciliation between the king and the archbishop at Tours in June. Geoffrey's estates were returned to him in July, after paying 800 marks of his fine.

Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191, at Tours in France, by Barthelemy de Vendôme, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Tours">Archbishop of Tours</a>, after the papacy agreed to allow the consecration. This permission was secured by the intervention of the king and his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard's support as part of an effort to secure a counter-weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor, William Longchamp, about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily. Geoffrey received his <a href="pallium">pallium</a>, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, at his consecration. In September 1191, after the consecration, he attempted to go to York, but was met at <a href="Dover">Dover</a> by agents of Longchamp, and even though he took refuge in the <a href="Dover%20Priory">priory of St. Martin in Dover</a>, was dragged from <a href="Sanctuary%23Legal%20sanctuary">sanctuary</a> and imprisoned in <a href="Dover%20Castle">Dover Castle</a>. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn <a href="fealty">fealty</a> to Richard, but this was probably just an excuse to eliminate a rival. Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey's arrest. But the actions of Longchamp's agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor's arrest of Geoffrey, even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents. One cause of the outrage was the obvious parallel with the murder of <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, who had been dragged from an altar and martyred. The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge, between <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a> and <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a>; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship, and <a href="Hugh%20of%20Lincoln">Hugh of Lincoln</a>, the Bishop of Lincoln, excommunicated those who had dragged Geoffrey from sanctuary. Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191.

While still embroiled in his conflict with Longchamp, Geoffrey began feuding with Hugh du Puiset, probably over Geoffrey's authority in Puiset's diocese of Durham, one of those subject to York. The dispute dragged on for years, with many appeals to Rome and the king. York had been vacant for several years, and Puiset had grown used to having untrammelled authority in the northern archdiocese. After Geoffrey's consecration, he summoned Puiset to a <a href="provincial%20synod">provincial synod</a> in late September 1191, at which the bishop was charged with various irregularities. Puiset appealed to Rome and refused to attend the synod, and was excommunicated in December by Geoffrey. An attempt in March 1192 by Queen Eleanor and Hubert Walter to settle the issue came to nothing when Geoffrey insisted on a pledge of obedience from Puiset, who in turn demanded an admission from Geoffrey that the excommunication had been unjust. Further appeals to Rome led to an eventual settlement in October 1192, when the bishop finally acknowledged Geoffrey's authority over Durham.

Geoffrey caused offence by his attempts to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury, thus implying that his diocese was superior or at least equal to Canterbury in rank. In pursuit of this rivalry between York and Canterbury, Geoffrey was the first archbishop of York to style himself "<a href="Primate%20%28bishop%29">Primate</a> of England", in opposition to the Canterbury title of "<a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Primate of all England</a>". He also attempted to subordinate <a href="Medieval%20parish%20churches%20of%20York%23St%20Clement%2C%20Clementhorpe">Clementhorpe Priory</a> to <a href="Godstow">Godstow Abbey</a>, which provoked an appeal from Prioress Alice of Clementhorpe to the papacy. Probably owing to Pope <a href="Pope%20Celestine%20III">Celestine III</a>'s dislike of Geoffrey, Hubert Walter was given a papal legateship that included Geoffrey's province, something that had not been usual in the preceding years, and which presented Geoffrey with some difficulties in his dealings with the ecclesiastical hierarchy. But Geoffrey was on friendly terms with Prince John; the historian G. V. Scammell has suggested that Geoffrey's consecration allowed John to feel that Geoffrey was no longer a rival for the throne, thus paving the way for good relations between the two half-brothers.

Geoffrey long faced opposition from some members of his cathedral chapter led by Henry Marshal, Burchard du Puiset, and Roger of London. They objected to his having given a large part of York's treasury toward Richard's ransom, and to some of his appointments in the church of York. Charges of <a href="simony">simony</a>, extortion, and neglect of his duties were lodged against Geoffrey, who in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canons</a> out of church. Geoffrey also faced difficulties with his appointees to the office of Dean of York; his first choice, his half-brother Peter, was opposed by the cathedral chapter. Geoffrey's second choice, <a href="Simon%20of%20Apulia">Simon of Apulia</a>, the chancellor of York, refused to give up the office when Geoffrey decided to award it to a third man, <a href="Philip%20of%20Poitou">Philip of Poitou</a>. Simon was supported by the cathedral chapter, who elected him to the office despite Geoffrey's opposition. An appeal was made to the papacy by Geoffrey while Simon travelled to King Richard in Germany. The king refused to allow the appeal and tried to summon Geoffrey to Germany to resolve the issue. Geoffrey was unable to leave York because of disturbances within the cathedral clergy, and Simon managed to secure papal confirmation as Dean of York.

When Prince <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">John</a> rebelled in 1193, Geoffrey and Hugh du Puiset put aside their feud to quash the uprising. Geoffrey strengthened <a href="Doncaster">Doncaster</a>'s defences and went to the aid of Puiset, who was besieging <a href="Tickhill%20Castle">Tickhill Castle</a>. In 1194 Geoffrey went into debt to the crown for the sum of 3000 marks to buy the office of <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Yorkshire">Sheriff of Yorkshire</a> for himself. Later that year Geoffrey began to quarrel with Hubert Walter over the <a href="Canterbury-York%20dispute">primacy</a> of England, which Canterbury claimed and York disputed. Walter's decision to have his episcopal cross carried before him in the diocese of York in March 1194 was symbolic of his claim to primacy over York and all of England. Geoffrey responded by having his own cross carried before him in the diocese of Canterbury the following month. King Richard did not reprimand Geoffrey for this act of provocation, and even went so far as to restore some of his confiscated estates. Before Richard left England in May 1194 he appointed Walter as Justiciar; that summer Walter began an investigation into Geoffrey's actions, which led to Geoffrey's estates being confiscated once again. Geoffrey appealed to the king, who was then in <a href="County%20of%20Maine">Maine</a>; Richard over-ruled Walter, restored Geoffrey's estates, and pardoned him in return for a payment of 1000 marks and the promise of 1000 more to follow.

In January 1195 Geoffrey was ordered to appear in Rome to answer various charges, under the threat of suspension from office if he did not appear by 1 June. Further quarrels with his cathedral clergy followed, including an instance of the cathedral chapter throwing <a href="chrism">chrism</a> on a dungheap in protest. Geoffrey protested to the king after Richard forbade Geoffrey's projected journey to Rome and in retaliation the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates once more. This left Geoffrey vulnerable when Walter held a <a href="legatine%20council">legatine council</a> at York in June 1195. Geoffrey had managed to secure a postponement of his case at Rome until 1 November, but was still unable to attend, which led Pope Celestine to order that Geoffrey's suspension should be performed by Hugh of Lincoln. Hugh protested, and as a result Celestine himself suspended Geoffrey on 23 December 1195, finally forcing Geoffrey to answer the charges against him. He travelled to Rome in 1196, where his accusers were unable to substantiate their claims and he was restored to office by the pope.

Geoffrey quarrelled with Richard in 1196 in Normandy while the archbishop was attempting to return to England. Richard forbade him from administering York, and Geoffrey returned to Rome until 1198. An attempt at reconciliation with Richard came to nothing, after Geoffrey refused to approve the king's appointments in the diocese of York without some guarantees that they would be approved by the papacy. Ultimately Pope <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Innocent III</a> on 28 April 1199 ordered that Geoffrey was to be restored to his lands as soon as he had paid his debts to the king. Innocent further ordered that any royal appointments in York would require papal approval.

After John succeeded Richard in 1199, he decided to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates, but continued to receive the income until the archbishop returned from Rome. Some of Geoffrey's opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices, and for a short time peace reigned in York. But the perceived arrogance of Geoffrey's officials offended the cathedral chapter at York, and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200. For most of the remainder of 1199 Geoffrey was frequently with the king, and the two appear to have been on good terms, a state of affairs that continued throughout the first half of 1200.

In October 1200 Geoffrey refused to allow the collection of <a href="carucage">carucage</a>, a tax on land, on his property, and his lands were confiscated in retaliation. He then excommunicated the new sheriff of Yorkshire, <a href="James%20of%20Poterne">James of Poterne</a>, who had ravaged Geoffrey's lands in revenge. In November 1200, Geoffrey and John were reconciled at Hugh of Lincoln's funeral, which allowed Geoffrey to regain his confiscated estates, but the archbishop's continued refusal to allow the collection of carucage led to the truce falling apart. In January 1201, John made peace with his half brother, but it did not last, as Geoffrey continued to refuse to allow the tax to be collected. John then renewed the demand for the payment for the office of sheriff due from Richard's reign, which forced Geoffrey to rescind his excommunication and offer another payment in return for peace, which occurred in May 1201. But it was short-lived; disputes over the appointments in the diocese of York broke out, but with the support of Pope Innocent Geoffrey was able to secure the appointment of a few of his own candidates. Geoffrey also quarrelled with some of the monasteries in his diocese, with the usual claims and counterclaims going to the papacy for judgement. Among the religious houses Geoffrey had disagreements with were <a href="Guisborough%20Priory">Guisborough Priory</a>, <a href="Meaux%20Abbey">Meaux Abbey</a>, and <a href="Fountains%20Abbey">Fountains Abbey</a>. Most of these conflicts arose from disputed appointments to offices, but the quarrel with Meaux involved claims of tithe exemption by that house.

Geoffrey submitted to John in 1206, and his lands were returned to him. But in 1207 Geoffrey led the clergy of England in their refusal to pay royal taxation and was forced into exile. Geoffrey excommunicated anyone who attempted to collect the tax in his archdiocese, but the king confiscated Geoffrey's estates in retaliation. Geoffrey once again secured the support of Pope Innocent, who ordered John to restore Geoffrey's possessions, but in the meantime the archbishop had fled to France. A medieval chronicler, <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Coldingham">Geoffrey of Coldingham</a>, stated that the English church considered Geoffrey a martyr because of this stand against King John.

Geoffrey died while still in exile at Grandmont in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> on 12 December 1212. He was buried at a <a href="Grandmontine">Grandmontine</a> monastery near Rouen, where he had been living for a few years. His tomb was still extant in 1767, when the inscription on it was recorded by an antiquary. He may have become a monk before his death.

Although his archiepiscopate was mainly marked by the conflicts in which he engaged, Geoffrey also managed to institute some administrative reforms in his diocese, creating the office of chancellor. He also inspired loyalty from some of his household members, many of whom witnessed his charters, and although he made enemies of several of the suffragan bishops, clergy and religious houses in his diocese, he also secured the friendship and support of other clergy, including Pope Innocent III and Hugh of Lincoln. Although Walter Map declared that Geoffrey was "full of faults and devoid of character", he remained loyal to his father until Henry's death. A modern-day historian, Thomas Jones, summed up Geoffrey's character with the phrase "quarrelsome and undiplomatic". Another historian, J. C. Holt, stated that Geoffrey was through his career "a perpetual source of danger, quarrelling now with de Puiset, now with the Yorkshire sheriffs, ever ready to attack the judicial and fiscal superiority of the Crown."

Geoffrey's ambitions may have included becoming King of England, which may account for some of the harshness that his two legitimate half-brothers displayed towards him. His military abilities, displayed in the rebellion of 1173–1174, as well his custody of castles near Tours, would have also fed into Richard's disquiet over Geoffrey's possible intentions. Geoffrey was known to be ambitious, which led the historian D. L. Douie to call him a "formidable bastard". The historian Ralph Turner said of Geoffrey that "he sought power and wealth despite the handicap of his birth" and that he had "inherited the bad temper of the other Plantagenets".

Geoffrey was a patron of scholarship, and employed scholars throughout his life, one of whom, <a href="Honorius%20of%20Kent">Honorius of Kent</a>, Geoffrey appointed <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Richmond">Archdeacon of Richmond</a>. Honorius was subsequently employed by Hubert Walter and wrote a legal work on canon law. The <a href="Psalter%20of%20St.%20Louis">Leiden St Louis Psalter</a> is a lavishly illuminated <a href="psalter">psalter</a> made for the archbishop, probably in northern England in the 1190s, which passed into the hands of <a href="Blanche%20of%20Castile">Blanche of Castile</a> after Geoffrey's death, and, as religious manuscripts often were, was used to teach the future saint King <a href="Louis%20IX%20of%20France">Louis IX of France</a> how to read, as recorded by a 14th-century inscription. After the king's death it passed through several royal owners, regarded as a relic of the saint, before reaching the <a href="Leiden%20University">University Library at Leiden</a> in 1741.

William de Longchamp

William de Longchamp (died 1197) was a medieval <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, <a href="Justiciar">Chief Justiciar</a>, and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ely">Bishop of Ely</a> in England. Born to a humble family in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, he owed his advancement to royal favour. Although contemporary writers accused Longchamp's father of being the son of a peasant, he held land as a knight. Longchamp first served <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>'s illegitimate son <a href="Geoffrey%20%28archbishop%20of%20York%29">Geoffrey</a>, but quickly transferred to the service of <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a>, Henry's heir. When Richard became king in 1189, Longchamp paid £3,000 for the office of Chancellor, and was soon named to the <a href="Diocese">see</a>, or bishopric, of Ely and appointed <a href="papal%20legate">legate</a> by the pope.

Longchamp governed England while Richard was on the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a>, but his authority was challenged by Richard's brother, <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a>, who eventually succeeded in driving Longchamp from power and from England. Longchamp's relations with the other leading English nobles were also strained, which contributed to the demands for his exile. Soon after Longchamp's departure from England, Richard was captured on his journey back to England from the crusade and held for ransom by <a href="Henry%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Longchamp travelled to Germany to help negotiate Richard's release. Although Longchamp regained the office of Chancellor after Richard's return to England, he lost much of his former power. He aroused a great deal of hostility among his contemporaries during his career, but he retained Richard's trust and was employed by the king until the bishop's death in 1197. Longchamp wrote a treatise on the law, which remained well known throughout the later Middle Ages.

Longchamp's ancestors originated in the village of Longchamps, <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>. Although it is known that he was born in Normandy, the exact location is unknown, with it perhaps being near the Norman village of Argenton. His father, Hugh de Longchamp, also held land in England, as did many other Norman nobles after the <a href="Norman%20Conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest of England</a> in 1066. <a href="Hugh%20Nonant">Hugh Nonant</a>—one of Longchamp's opponents—declared that the elder Longchamp was the son of a peasant, which seems unlikely, as Hugh de Longchamp appears to have held a <a href="knight%27s%20fee">knight's tenancy</a> in Normandy. The family was originally of humble background, but rose through service to King Henry II. The elder Longchamp also held land in <a href="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a> in England, including the manor of <a href="Wilton%2C%20Herefordshire">Wilton</a> near <a href="Ross-on-Wye">Ross</a> in Wales. Hugh married a woman named Eve, a relative of the <a href="de%20Lacy">Lacy family</a>. Historian David Balfour suggests that Eve was the daughter of <a href="Gilbert%20de%20Lacy">Gilbert de Lacy</a>, the son of <a href="Roger%20de%20Lacy">Roger de Lacy</a>, exiled by King <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William II</a> in 1095 for rebellion.

Longchamp's sister, Richeut, married the <a href="castellan">castellan</a> of <a href="Dover%20Castle">Dover Castle</a>. A second sister, Melisend, came to England with Longchamp, but otherwise is unknown. A sister is recorded as having married Stephen Devereux, but whether this is Melisend is unclear. Of Longchamp's brothers, <a href="Osbert%20de%20Longchamp">Osbert</a> remained a layman, and owed much of his advancement to William; Stephen served King Richard I on crusade; <a href="Henry%20de%20Longchamp">Henry</a>, another layman, became a sheriff along with Osbert; and Robert became a monk. Two of Longchamp's brothers became <a href="abbot">abbot</a>s.

Longchamp entered public life at the close of Henry II's reign, as an official for the King's illegitimate son <a href="Geoffrey%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20York">Geoffrey</a>. He soon left Geoffrey's service, and served in Henry II's <a href="Chancery%20%28medieval%20office%29">chancery</a>, or writing office, before he entered service with Henry's son Richard. Richard, who was Duke of Aquitaine at the time, named Longchamp chancellor of the <a href="Duke%20of%20Aquitaine">Duchy of Aquitaine</a>. Longchamp first distinguished himself at the court of King <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip II of France</a> in Paris in 1189, when he acted as Richard's envoy in a dispute with <a href="William%20Marshal%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">William Marshall</a>, King Henry's envoy. By that time, Longchamp was already one of Richard's trusted advisors.

On Richard's accession to the throne of England in 1189 Longchamp became Chancellor of England. Longchamp paid 3,000 <a href="pound%20sterling">pounds</a> (£) for the office of Chancellor. This was followed by an increase in the price of having chancery documents sealed with the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20Realm">Great Seal</a>, necessary for their authentication, perhaps to help Longchamp recoup the cost of office. At the council held at Pipewell on 15 September 1189, the King raised Longchamp to the bishopric of <a href="Diocese%20of%20Ely">Ely</a>. Richard named three other bishops at the same time: <a href="Godfrey%20de%20Lucy">Godfrey de Lucy</a> to <a href="Diocese%20of%20Winchester">Winchester</a>, <a href="Richard%20FitzNeal">Richard FitzNeal</a> to <a href="Diocese%20of%20London">London</a>, and <a href="Hubert%20Walter">Hubert Walter</a> to <a href="Diocese%20of%20Salisbury">Salisbury</a>. Longchamp was consecrated on 31 December 1189 and enthroned at Ely on 6 January 1190.

Before leaving England in 1189, Richard put the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> in Longchamp's hands and appointed him jointly with <a href="Hugh%20de%20Puiset">Hugh de Puiset</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, to the office of Chief Justiciar, at that time not strictly a judicial office. Instead, the justiciar was the person entrusted with much of the king's authority when the king was outside the kingdom, able to act in the king's name. Along with Puiset, the king named <a href="Hugh%20Bardulf">Hugh Bardulf</a>, <a href="William%20Brewer%20%28justice%29">William Briwerre</a>, <a href="Geoffrey%20fitz%20Peter">Geoffrey fitz Peter</a>, and William Marshall as associates in the justiciarship, under Puiset and Longchamp. As Justiciar, Longchamp sent judges throughout the country to visit the <a href="shire">shire</a>s on judicial visits, even though he had no previous knowledge of the judiciary. Longchamp and Puiset were unable to work together, and so in March 1190 Richard gave authority north of the <a href="Humber">River Humber</a> to Hugh, and authority south of the river to Longchamp. Historian's opinions are divided whether Richard explicitly made Longchamp superior to Puiset at this time, or if in theory the two were supposed to co-equal in their respective spheres. By June, Longchamp had eased Puiset out of power and the justiciar's office. He also received a commission as a papal legate from Pope <a href="Pope%20Clement%20III">Clement III</a> at this time. Supposedly Richard paid 1,500 <a href="Mark%20%28money%29">mark</a>s (£1,000) to the papacy to secure the legateship for Longchamp.

Longchamp granted the citizens of London the right to elect their own sheriffs, and to collect and remit their monetary levy of £300 directly to the <a href="Exchequer">Exchequer</a>, the treasury of England. On Longchamp's visits to his diocese he was accompanied by a large train of retainers and animals, which became notorious throughout the country as a sign of his extravagance. Under his legatine authority, the bishop held <a href="legatine%20council">legatine council</a>s of the church at Gloucester and Westminster in 1190. He also acted to restore authority in York, which had suffered a breakdown in order after the <a href="12th%20century%20English%20pogroms">massacre of Jews</a> in March 1190. Also in 1190, he sent an army against <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Gruffydd">Rhys ap Gruffydd</a>, a Welsh prince who was attempting to throw off the control of the <a href="marcher%20lords">marcher lords</a> that surrounded Wales.

Longchamp's relations with the English people were made more difficult because he was a native of Normandy, and often insensitive to English customs. The medieval writer <a href="William%20of%20Newburgh">William of Newburgh</a> claimed that Longchamp was "an obscure foreigner of unproven ability and loyalty". For example, it appears likely that Longchamp did not speak English, making his relations with his flock more difficult. The leading nobles complained that Longchamp marginalised the other officials Richard had appointed to serve with him, and that he brought in foreigners to fill offices. Although the first charge is mostly untrue, the second appears to have been valid, as Longchamp did install non-natives in judicial offices and as <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a>s. He also attempted to seize control of a number of English castles by granting their custody to relatives and dependents.

Throughout 1190, Longchamp's relations with Richard's younger brother John were difficult. This led to Longchamp besieging <a href="Lincoln%20Castle">Lincoln Castle</a> because the castellan would not surrender the castle and allow himself to be replaced by Longchamp's nominee. The castellan, <a href="Gerard%20de%20Camville">Gerard de Camville</a>, had sworn allegiance to John and stated he would no longer recognise the chancellor's authority. In response, John took the two castles of <a href="Tickhill%20Castle">Tickhill</a> and <a href="Northampton%20Castle">Northampton</a>. News of the dispute reached Richard, who sent <a href="Walter%20de%20Coutances">Walter de Coutances</a>, the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Rouen">Archbishop of Rouen</a>, to England in late spring 1191, with orders to negotiate a peace between John and Longchamp. Eventually, Walter brokered a compromise between the two as a result of which Gerard was confirmed as castellan and John relinquished the castles. Longchamp also agreed to work to ensure John's succession to the throne in the event of Richard's death.

Longchamp's legatine commission from the papacy expired in spring 1191, on the death of Clement III, thus removing one of Longchamp's power bases. The legation was, however, renewed a few months later by Clement's successor, <a href="Pope%20Celestine%20III">Celestine III</a>. A further complication for Longchamp arose in September 1191, when Henry II's illegitimate son Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, was arrested by Longchamp's subordinates, led by the castellan of Dover Castle, Longchamp's brother-in-law. Their orders had been to arrest the Archbishop of York as he landed at <a href="Dover">Dover</a> on the archbishop's return to England, but Geoffrey had been warned of their plans, and fled to <a href="sanctuary">sanctuary</a> in <a href="Dover%20Priory">St. Martin's Priory</a>. Longchamp's men laid siege to the priory, and after four days forcibly removed Geoffrey. The violence of the attack reminded the public of <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>'s martyrdom, and public opinion turned against Longchamp. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn <a href="fealty">fealty</a> to Richard, but this was likely just an excuse to eliminate a rival.

An intense propaganda campaign led by partisans of John ensued. One of the leaders of the campaign against Longchamp was Hugh Nonant, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Coventry">Bishop of Coventry</a>, and he along with other magnates, including Geoffrey, who had been released, convened a trial on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge near London. Longchamp did not attend, but he was deposed and excommunicated, and after trying to hold the Tower of London, he was forced to surrender due to lack of support from the citizens of London. The council then declared his offices forfeit, and ordered the surrender of the castles in his custody. The main charge against Longchamp appears to have been his autocratic behaviour.

Longchamp went to Dover in late 1191 to seek transport to the continent. During his escape, he was unable to answer the local people when they spoke to him in English. He attempted to leave England in various disguises, including a monk's habit and women's clothes. Hugh Nonant wrote that Longchamp attempted on one occasion to hide dressed as a prostitute, which led to him being assaulted by a fisherman who mistook him for a whore. Longchamp eventually succeeded in leaving England, on 29 October.

Longchamp went to the court of Henry VI, the Holy Roman Emperor, who was holding King Richard captive at <a href="Trifels%20Castle">Trifels</a>. The bishop arranged for Richard to be held at the imperial court and negotiated a payment plan for the ransom, 100,000 marks, under the terms of which the emperor agreed to release Richard once 70,000 marks had been paid and hostages for the payment of the rest had been received. When the Emperor in January 1194 called a meeting of the imperial magnates to debate King Philip II of France's offer to pay the Emperor to keep Richard captive, Longchamp attended along with Walter of Coutances and <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>, Richard's mother. After further diplomatic wrangling, Richard was freed on 4 February 1194.

Richard rewarded Longchamp with the custody of <a href="Eye%2C%20Suffolk">Eye</a> and an appointment as <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Essex">Sheriff of Essex</a> and <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Hertfordshire">Sheriff of Hertfordshire</a> when the pair returned to England, but Longchamp soon became embroiled in a renewal of his disagreement with Archbishop Geoffrey of York. Richard left England in May 1194, and Longchamp accompanied him to the continent, never to return to England; Longchamp returned to the Emperor's court in 1195. Richard continued to use Longchamp in diplomacy—although it was Geoffrey who arranged a truce with King Philip in 1194—as well as retaining the bishop as chancellor, but the main power in England was now Hubert Walter. Longchamp spent the rest of his life outside his diocese, usually accompanying the king.

Longchamp died in January 1197, at <a href="Poitiers">Poitiers</a>, while on a diplomatic mission to Rome for Richard, and was buried at the abbey of Le Pin. Much of the information on his career comes from people hostile to him, for example, <a href="Gerald%20of%20Wales">Gerald of Wales</a> called Longchamp that "monster with many heads". The historian <a href="Austin%20Lane%20Poole">Austin Lane Poole</a> says that Gerald described Longchamp as more like an ape than a man. Longchamp was reportedly a cultured and well-educated man. He was supported by others among his contemporaries, including Pope Clement III, who, when he appointed Longchamp legate, wrote that he did so at the urging of the English bishops. When he was one of four men named bishop in 1189, medieval chronicler <a href="Richard%20of%20Devizes">Richard of Devizes</a> wrote that the four new bishops were "men of no little virtue and fame". Historian <a href="John%20Gillingham">John Gillingham</a> wrote that Longchamp's "record of his life in politics and administration was a good one, spoiled only by his failure in 1191".

One of Longchamp's probable innovations as chancellor was the replacement of the first person singular previously used in documents drafted in the king's name with the <a href="majestic%20plural">majestic plural</a> or "royal we". He wrote a work on law entitled "Practica legum et decretorum", a manual on the usage of both civil and canon law in the <a href="House%20of%20Plantagenet">Angevin</a> possessions on the continent, composed sometime between 1181 and 1189. It was well known in the Middle Ages, and served as a practical guide for those involved in litigation. The medieval poet Nigel Wireker (also known as <a href="Nigel%20de%20Longchamps">Nigel de Longchamps</a>) dedicated to the bishop a satirical poem, "Speculum Stultorum" ("Mirror of Fools"), on the habits of students. <a href="Richard%20Barre">Richard Barre</a>, a medieval writer and judge, dedicated his work "Compendium de veteris et novo testamento" to Longchamp. Longchamp was one of Barre's patrons, and secured the post of <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Ely">Archdeacon of Ely</a> for him as well as judicial posts.

Two writers have seen in the assembly that met to try Longchamp in 1191 a precursor to the gathering at <a href="Runnymede">Runnymede</a> in 1215 that drew up <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>, as it was one of the earliest examples of the nobles of the realm coming together to force the government to rule with their advice. Longchamp also promoted the careers of his brothers; Henry and Osbert became sheriffs in the 1190s, Osbert the Sheriff of Yorkshire. His brother Robert, a cleric, also benefitted, becoming <a href="prior">prior</a> of the Ely <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> and later abbot of <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Abbey%2C%20York">St Mary's Abbey, York</a>.

Myst III: Exile

Myst III: Exile is the third title in the "<a href="Myst%20%28series%29">Myst</a>" series of <a href="Graphic%20adventure%20game">graphic adventure</a> <a href="puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle video game</a>s. While the preceding games in the series, "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" and "<a href="Riven">Riven</a>", were produced by <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> and published by <a href="Br%C3%B8derbund">Brøderbund</a>, "Exile" was developed by <a href="Presto%20Studios">Presto Studios</a> and published by <a href="Ubi%20Soft">Ubi Soft</a>. The game was released on four <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a>s for both <a href="Mac%20OS">Mac OS</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> on May 8, 2001; versions for the <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> and <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> were released in late 2002.

As in previous games, the player assumes the role of the <a href="Stranger%20%28Myst%29">Stranger</a>, a friend of <a href="Atrus">Atrus</a>. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In "Exile", Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' tablet.

The creators of the "Myst" franchise gave the task of creating the third "Myst" game to Presto Studios, known for its adventure game series <a href="The%20Journeyman%20Project%20%28series%29">"The Journeyman Project"</a>. Presto sought to develop a diverse and logical approach to puzzles and Ages, and worked to make the villain sympathetically multifaceted. The developers hired <a href="Jack%20Wall%20%28composer%29">Jack Wall</a> to develop a musical style different from earlier composer <a href="Robyn%20Miller">Robyn Miller</a> but still recognizable as a "Myst" game. The project required millions of U.S. dollars and more than two years to complete.

"Exile" was received well by critics; "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" called it the best game in the "Myst" series. Conversely, long-time critics of the series complained that "Exile" continued to prove that "Myst"s slower gameplay did not belong in the fast-paced modern game market; <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> editor <a href="Greg%20Kasavin">Greg Kasavin</a> described the "Myst" series as having lost its relevance. Despite selling more than one million copies within the first year of release, "Exile" fared poorer commercially than "Myst" and "Riven", which had sold more than 10 million copies combined. "", the fourth game in the series, was developed and published solely by Ubisoft.

Gameplay in "Myst III: Exile" is similar to that of its predecessors. The player explores immersive, <a href="pre-rendered">pre-rendered</a> environments known as "Ages" by using either <a href="mouse%20%28computing%29">mouse</a> clicks or the <a href="space%20bar">space bar</a> for movement from set nodes across each Age. Unlike previous games, which employed a series of still images, "Exile" uses a "free look" system which gives the player a 360-degree field of view. The game also has an optional Zip mode, like "Myst" and "Riven", to cross explored terrain quickly by skipping several nodes. Clicking allows the player to manipulate objects and pick up items. The on-screen cursor changes in context to show possible actions.

Each of the game's Ages has a distinctive look and theme. Players begin their journey on the Age of J'nanin, which acts as a hub linking to other Ages and as a "lesson Age" demonstrating important principles for later puzzles. Three of these Ages are Amateria, a mechanical Age in the middle of a vast sea; Edanna, a world of preserved nature, with abundant plant and animal life; and Voltaic, a dusty island riddled with canyons filled with man-made constructions.

By gathering clues and manipulating the environment, the player solves thematically linked puzzles. For example, the book leading to Voltaic is accessed by aligning beams of light across a canyon; the Age itself contains similar energy-based puzzles. Edanna's plant-filled puzzles require manipulation of the Age's <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. Puzzles often involve observing interactions between elements of the environment, then adjusting the links between them. The player can also pick up and view journals or pages written by game characters which reveal <a href="back-story">back-story</a> and give hints to solving puzzles. Cursor Mode allows the player to select items from a personal inventory at the bottom of the screen.

"Exile" begins 10 years after the events of "Riven", when the <a href="Stranger%20%28Myst%29">Stranger</a> arrives at the home of <a href="Atrus">Atrus</a> and his wife Catherine. Atrus is a scientist and explorer who has mastered an ancient practice known as the Art: he can create links to different Ages by writing special books. This ability is by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, whose society crumbles after the D'ni city is devastated by a plague. Atrus calls the Stranger to his home to display his newest Age, Releeshahn, which Atrus has designed as a new home for the D'ni survivors.

As Atrus is preparing to leave for Releeshahn, a mysterious man appears in Atrus' study, steals the Releeshahn book and leaves behind another. Following the thief, the Stranger arrives at J'nanin, an Age that Atrus had written long before as a way to teach the Art to his sons. Because the thief has caused considerable damage to the J'nanin book, Atrus cannot accompany the Stranger.

The mysterious man is named <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Saavedro">Saavedro</a>. Twenty years earlier, Atrus' wayward sons <a href="Sirrus">Sirrus</a> and <a href="Achenar">Achenar</a> destroyed Saavedro's home Age of Narayan and trapped him on J'nanin. Saavedro believes his family is dead and swears vengeance on Atrus, unaware that Atrus has already imprisoned his sons for their crimes and that Saavedro's family is still alive. The game can end several ways depending on the player's actions. In the most ideal scenario, Saavedro returns to Narayan peacefully after giving back the book of Releeshahn. Other endings result in Saavedro destroying Releeshahn or killing the player; another option allows the player to leave Saavedro trapped forever.

<a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> and <a href="Mattel">Mattel</a> (then the owner of the "Myst" and "Riven" franchise) offered the task of developing the sequel to several development companies; according to "<a href="Game%20Developer%20%28magazine%29">Game Developer</a>", interested parties developed proposals including story concepts, analysis of the first two games, technology discussion, and technology demonstration. A core team from <a href="Presto%20Studios">Presto Studios</a> held discussions which analyzed "Myst" and "Riven", then set out specific goals for the third game. According to Presto founder and producer Greg Uhler, these goals included visual variety in the Ages, a satisfying ending, and a way for players to gauge their progress during the game. The progress goal was very important for Uhler, who stated: "Players who had failed to complete "Myst" or "Riven" did so because they were unsure of how much remained of the game and what their goals were." Initially, Presto prepared three possible storylines for the game to follow; a meeting between Cyan, Presto, and Mattel yielded a completely different plot, which explored some of the loose ends hinted at in "Myst". Presto spent millions of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">U.S. dollars</a> developing the game, using the studio's entire staff to complete the project. Development took two and a half years, of which nine months were spent on design and pre-production.

Pre-rendered environments, like those in the earlier "Myst" games, were used, providing what producer Dan Irish described as the "photorealistic ability to present the world in a convincing way. The 360-degree camera view also allows you to experience it in a way that makes it feel real." Particular attention was devoted to strong visual styles and mechanics, which a critic described as "a collaboration of <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>, <a href="Rube%20Goldberg">Rube Goldberg</a> and <a href="Claes%20Oldenburg">Claes Oldenburg</a>".

As in "Myst" and "Riven", the developers used live-action sequences instead of computer-generated actors and props; Irish stated that using computer graphics would have reminded players they were in a game, "which would wreck the immersion that is so critical to the "Myst" games". Live actors were filmed on a <a href="Chroma%20key">blue screen</a> and then placed in the digital environments using <a href="chroma%20key">chroma key</a> technology. Before any shooting could begin, all the sets were constructed and filled with props the actors could use, costumes for all the characters were fashioned, and each scene was plotted out by <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>. <a href="Rand%20Miller">Rand Miller</a> returned to play <a href="Atrus">Atrus</a>, a role he had filled since the first "Myst" game. <a href="Brad%20Dourif">Brad Dourif</a>, a professional actor best known for the <a href="Child%27s%20Play%20%28franchise%29">"Child's Play" films</a>, agreed to play Saavedro because he was a huge "Myst" fan. Dourif noted that acting for a game was much more difficult than working on movie sets, as he could not see the player or interact with the game environment. Other actors included Maria Galante as Atrus' wife Catherine, and Greg Uhler's daughter Audrey in a cameo as Atrus' daughter <a href="Yeesha">Yeesha</a>. Preparation for the video shoots took four months; filming the scenes took just seven days. Uhler noted that the video was one aspect of "Myst" that Presto "did wrong"; because high-definition video cameras were not used, the resulting video was not as crisp as developers had hoped.

The music for "Myst" and "Riven" was composed by Robyn Miller; <a href="Jack%20Wall%20%28composer%29">Jack Wall</a> created the score for the third installment. Irish stated that developing the music was one of the hardest aspects of "Exile": "We had to match or exceed the surrealistic style of music that Robyn [Miller] had pioneered. It had to be recognizable as "Myst", but unique and distinctive." Wall looked at the increasing complexity of games as an opportunity to give players a soundtrack with as much force as a movie score. Wall also echoed Irish's opinion that he wanted to make a very different score from the "wonderful sonic pastiche" of "Myst" and "Riven", yet still recognizable as a sequel to the earlier games; Wall considered copying Miller's style as the "safe" yet unappealing route that was expected of him.

In preparation for his composition, Wall studied Miller's music, noting that he and Miller differed on their use of music theory. Miller, according to Wall, felt that "melody could easily get in the way of the experience of playing the game", but Wall felt that some melody provided something thematic for the player to grasp. Wall wanted the music to have a sense of purpose while still preserving interactivity, so he composed "reward music" for completing puzzles and recorded the score with a real orchestra.
"Exile" was generally received positively upon release; the PC version holds a 77% rating at <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> and an 83%/100 rating at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>.

"Exile" graphics and sound received nearly universal praise, and were credited with completing the game's immersion. The puzzles were described as less difficult and more contained, meaning that players did not have to experiment with switches and then click several screens away to see the effect, as in "Riven". "<a href="Macworld">Macworld</a>"s Peter Cohen praised Presto for giving out bits of story throughout the game, rather than providing exposition only during opening and closing sequences. The pacing and rewards system was also appreciated by reviewers. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> concluded their review of the game by stating that Presto had done "a pretty good job with a notable addition to the series". "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" offered even stronger praise, saying that Presto had crafted the best "Myst" game in the series thus far, a sentiment that was echoed in other publications. The editors of "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" named "Exile" the best adventure game of 2001, and called it "a breath of fresh air amidst the otherwise barren crop of adventure titles." They also presented the game with their "Best Art Direction" and "Best Acting" awards, the latter for Dourif's performance.

Criticism of the game included complaints about the four-disc format of the game, which required players to swap out the installer disc with one of the other discs every time the player entered a new Age. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Scott Osborne noted that due to the frame-by-frame nature of gameplay, it was occasionally difficult to discern where players were allowed to venture and what areas were unreachable. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" reported that bugs including a lack of sound, incompatibility with certain graphics cards and system crashes were present in as many as 10 percent of the first shipment of discs. Reviewers who had not enjoyed "Myst" or "Riven" stated that there was nothing new or substantially different in the game to warrant interest; "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" observed, ""Exile" has everything you loved or hated about "Myst" and "Riven"."

The <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> nominated "Myst III" for its 2001 "Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Design", "Computer Action/Adventure Game of the Year" and "Outstanding Achievement in Original Musical Composition" awards. However, these categories ultimately went to "<a href="Ico">Ico</a>", "<a href="Return%20to%20Castle%20Wolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a>" and "<a href="Tropico">Tropico</a>", respectively. In 2011, <a href="Adventure%20Gamers">Adventure Gamers</a> named "Myst III" the 59th-best adventure game ever released.

"Exile" was the best-selling computer title in the United States within a week of release, with an average retail price of $42. Its "Collector's Edition" claimed fifth place. The two <a href="Stock%20keeping%20unit">SKUs</a> held #1 and #9 the following week, by which time Ubisoft reported overall sales of 75,000 units. After staying in first place for three weeks, "Exile" dropped to third during the week ending June 2. It was the fourth-best-selling computer game of May in the region; <a href="PC%20Data">PC Data</a> reported sales of 54,468 retail units for the month. The "Collector's Edition" secured 12th place and sold 20,104. "Exile" remained on <a href="NPD%20Intelect">NPD Intelect</a>'s weekly computer game sales top 10 from June 3-23, and maintained fourth place for the month of June; PC Data tracked domestic retail sales of 49,287 units during the period. According to Ubisoft, "Exile" sold over 400,000 units worldwide by June 30.

"Exile" remained in NPD Intelect's monthly top 20 from July through August, and sold 173,569 domestic retail units by October, while its "Collector's Edition" sold 40,051. Following "Exile"s European release on September 7, it reached second place on the British sales charts, and #1 on those of Germany and France. Ubisoft reported global sales of over 750,000 units by the end of September, and of nearly 1.2 million units by the end of December. Its domestic retail sales for 2001 totaled 284,555 units, for $11.7 million in revenue. Domestic sales continued in 2002, with 80,810 retail units sold from January to June; and in 2003, with 43,735 sales for the year. By August 2006, "Exile"s computer version had sold 400,000 copies and earned $14 million in the United States alone. "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" ranked it as the country's 37th-best-selling computer game released between January 2000 and August 2006. As of the latter date, it was also the country's highest-selling "Myst" game released during the 2000s. By 2010, "Exile"s total sales had reached 1.5 million copies.

Despite strong sales, "Exile" was considered commercially disappointing compared to the phenomenal sales of the first two games, which had sold nearly 10 million units by the time of "Exile"s release. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> editor <a href="Greg%20Kasavin">Greg Kasavin</a> told "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine that ""Myst" is no longer as relevant to gamers as it used to be" and that "it represents an antiquated style of gaming" compared to the 3-D action games being released at the time. Soon after "Exile"s release, Presto announced it was discontinuing software development; the <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> title "<a href="Whacked%21">Whacked!</a>" was to be the last title produced by the company. Presto employee Michael Saladino pointed to the maverick style of the studio and its inability to develop more than one title at a time as reasons for its folding. The next game in the "Myst" series, entitled "", would be produced and published by <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>.

Turok: Dinosaur Hunter

Turok: Dinosaur Hunter is a <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Iguana%20Entertainment">Iguana Entertainment</a> and published by <a href="Acclaim%20Entertainment">Acclaim</a> for the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> console and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. It was released in <a href="1997%20in%20video%20gaming">1997</a> in North America and Europe. "Turok" is an adaptation of the <a href="Acclaim%20Comics">Acclaim Comics</a> comic book series of the <a href="Turok">same name</a>. The player controls Turok, a Native American warrior, who must stop the evil Campaigner from conquering the universe with an ancient and powerful weapon.

As Acclaim's first title for the Nintendo 64, "Turok" was part of a strategy to develop games internally and license merchandise; Acclaim acquired the rights to "Turok" when it purchased Valiant Comics in 1994, renaming it Acclaim Comics. Suffering from cash flow problems and falling sales, Acclaim came to rely on "Turok" as its best hope for a financial turnaround. Iguana pushed the Nintendo 64's graphics capabilities to its limits, and were forced to compress or cut elements to fit the game on its 8 megabyte cartridge. Bugs delayed the game's release from September 1996 to January 1997.

Critical reception of "Turok" was highly positive. Becoming one of the most popular games for the console on release, "Turok" won praise for its graphics and evolution of the genre. Complaints centered on graphical slowdowns caused by multiple enemies appearing onscreen and occasionally awkward controls. The game sold 1.5 million copies and boosted sales of the Nintendo 64. "Turok" spawned a video game franchise that includes a direct sequel, titled "", in 1998, and a prequel, "", in 2002. A <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remastered</a> version of the game by <a href="Night%20Dive%20Studios">Night Dive Studios</a> was released through <a href="digital%20distribution">digital distribution</a> for Microsoft Windows on December 17, 2015, followed by an Xbox One release on March 2, 2018 and a Nintendo Switch release on March 18, 2019.

Played from a first person perspective, the <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics</a> and style of play combine elements of the run-and-gun computer game "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>" with exploration mechanics of "<a href="Tomb%20Raider">Tomb Raider</a>". Players begin the game in a central hub <a href="level%20%28computer%20and%20video%20games%29">level</a>, which contains portals to seven other stages. The player must find keys scattered across the stages. When enough keys have been inserted into the lock mechanisms of a hub portal, that level is unlocked. Players explore the large, typically jungle-based levels by jumping, swimming, climbing, crawling, and running.

One of the player's main objectives is to find pieces of a relic known as the Chronoscepter; there is one piece on each level. In exploring the levels the player fights various enemies such as poachers, gunmen, indigenous warriors, dinosaurs, demons, and insects. "Turok" features 13 weapons plus the Chronoscepter, ranging from a knife and bow to high tech weaponry. All weapons except the knife require ammunition, which is dropped by dead enemies or picked up in the levels. Enemies and boss characters have multiple death animations depending on what body region the player shot. Because items dropped by fallen enemies rapidly disappear, players must engage foes from close range.

The player character's health is shown as a number at the bottom of the screen. When the player is at full health, the meter reads 100, while dropping to 0 subtracts one life. Gathering "life force" points scattered across the levels increases the player's life count by one for every 100 points accumulated. Players restore their health by picking up <a href="power-up">powerups</a>, which can increase their health above full. Players may also gain health points by shooting deer or non-threatening wildlife.

The player assumes control of Tal'Set (Turok), a Native American time-traveling warrior. The mantle of Turok is passed down every generation to the eldest male. Each Turok is charged with protecting the barrier between Earth and the Lost Land, a primitive world where time has no meaning. The Lost Land is inhabited by a variety of creatures, from dinosaurs to aliens. An evil overlord known as the Campaigner seeks an ancient artifact known as the Chronoscepter, a weapon so powerful that it was broken into pieces to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. The Campaigner plans on using a focusing array to magnify the Chronoscepter's power, destroying the barriers that separate the ages of time and rule the universe. Turok vows to find the Chronoscepter's eight pieces and prevent the Campaigner's schemes.

<a href="Turok">Turok</a> originally appeared in comics from <a href="Western%20Publishing">Western Publishing</a> and <a href="Dell%20Comics">Dell Comics</a> in December 1954. <a href="Valiant%20Comics">Valiant Comics</a> revived the series and published the first issue of their "Turok" series in 1993. Video game publisher <a href="Acclaim%20Entertainment">Acclaim Entertainment</a> bought Valiant for $65 million in 1994 and acquired developer <a href="Iguana%20Entertainment">Iguana Entertainment</a> for $5 million plus stock a year later, part of a strategy to develop games in-house and make money licensing characters in different entertainment media. "Turok" was announced in August 1994 as an exclusive title for Nintendo's planned "Ultra 64" console, eventually called the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>.

Development of "Turok" commenced in 1996. While loosely based on the comic book, Iguana made the game more action-oriented. In early discussions about the project the developers decided that the typical <a href="side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> game presentation had become tired. Iguana considered a third-person perspective similar to "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>" and "Tomb Raider", but decided to make the game a first-person shooter instead. According to project manager David Dienstbier, the first-person perspective was a natural way to showcase the 3D power of the Nintendo 64. While the development team benefited from Acclaim's clout as a longtime Nintendo supporter, getting earlier feedback from the publisher and more face-to-face time during production, most of the developers at Iguana were new and inexperienced; "Turok" was Dienstbier's first title. Due to the game's action and violent content, Dienstbier believed they were pushing the limits of what Nintendo would allow on their console, but Nintendo never asked to see or approve anything in the game.

The Nintendo 64 platform had superior processing capabilities compared to most personal computers available at the time, but also came with challenges. "The [Nintendo 64] is capable of doing a lot of stuff," Dienstbier said. "If you want to handle fancy particle lighting, and transparency effects, and you want to throw around huge amounts of math ... or geometry onscreen, it's got the processing power to do that, and yes it's a fantastic machine. However, calling it a developer's dream kinda gives you the impression that it's easy to crank out a game like "Turok", and it's definitely not." While Nintendo was supportive, Iguana had to produce all its game development tools internally. Fitting the game on its 8 <a href="megabyte">MB</a> cartridge was difficult; ultimately, Iguana had to compress everything and reduce the quality of the music to meet size requirements. Despite system constraints the developers were interested in producing the best-looking video game for the system: the game used real-time lighting effects and <a href="particle%20system">particle system</a>s for added realism. Iguana was able to use Acclaim's state-of-the-art <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a> studio, allowing humanoid characters to move smoothly and in a convincing manner; motion capture helped alleviate the problems of Iguana's limited resources and tight schedule. A stuntman recorded movements for the human characters; while the developers tried to use emus and ostriches for the dinosaurs, the results were only used as reference material.

At the time, Acclaim Entertainment was in financial jeopardy. The company was a major publisher in the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fourth%20generation%29">16 bit era of games</a>, but the company's sales suffered as it was slow to migrate from older game systems like the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> and <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> to next-generation platforms. The company lost $222 million in the 1996 fiscal year due to sales falling to $162 million compared to $567 million the previous year; in the first quarter of fiscal 1997, the company lost a further $19 million. The company laid off 100 of its 950 workers since March 1996 and its stock had dropped from a high of $13.875 a share to as low as $3. "Turok", Acclaim's first Nintendo 64 title, became the company's best hope of a turnaround, as there were only ten Nintendo 64 games on the market, and "Turok" was the only shooter. "Turok" was the only major Nintendo 64 software demonstrated at the September 1996 <a href="European%20Computer%20Trade%20Show">European Computer Trade Show</a>, with Nintendo themselves absent from the show. <a href="Alex.%20Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Alex. Brown Inc</a> analysts figured that selling one million copies of "Turok" could bring Acclaim as much as $45 million. Due to cash flow issues, much of the money planned for marketing "Turok" was contingent on strong sales of "". Endangering "Turok"s sales was its high price—$79.99 in the US, £70 in the UK, and $129.95 in Australia—and <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a>'s <a href="M%20for%20Mature">"mature" rating</a>, which suggested lower sales as parents would not buy the game for their children.

Following the game's success, <a href="Sculptured%20Software">Sculptured Software</a> (another of Acclaim's internal studios) conducted tests to see if "Turok: Dinosaur Hunter" could be faithfully converted to the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>.

Originally slated for a September 30, 1996 release in North America, the game was initially delayed to January 1997. Acclaim explained that the game had not reached the desired quality level; Nintendo maintained that the delay was to "add more depth to the gameplay". According to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", the delay stemmed from <a href="computer%20bug">computer bug</a>s in the program. Acclaim heavily marketed "Turok" on the covers of video-gaming magazines and in television commercials for the Nintendo 64. Acclaim gave media outlets such as "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">The Mirror</a>" customized "Turok"-branded game consoles to give away in sweepstakes. Responding to positive pre-orders and advance sales of "Turok", Acclaim announced on January 2, 1997 that a sequel, tentatively titled "", would be released in late 1997. Acclaim dubbed the March 4 release date of the game "Turok Tuesday", reporting that pre-sales at <a href="Toys%20%26quot%3BR%26quot%3B%20Us">Toys "R" Us</a> had exceeded expectations. Acclaim stock increased in anticipation before the game's release, up $0.62 to $5.94.

"Turok" was a critical and commercial success, earning rave reviews from video game magazines and becoming the most popular title for the Nintendo 64 in the months following its release. On the aggregate review web sites <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> and <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>, the console version of "Turok" has an 85% and 86.6% rating, respectively, each figure based on scores from thirteen contemporary and recent reviews.
Douglass Perry of the multimedia website <a href="IGN">IGN</a> compared "Turok" favorably to other first person shooters, saying that the title distinguished itself by allowing a level of 3D movement not possible in other members of the genre. Scary Larry of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>", who gave "Turok" a perfect score in all four categories (control, funfactor, graphics, and sound), similarly said "Turok has more firepower, more control over its environment, and more gruesome graphics than other corridor shooters." While agreeing that the game offers greater freedom of movement, a "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" reviewer opined that first-person platforming does not work since the player cannot see their character. He found this strongly contrasted with the game's "top notch" shooting elements. "<a href="The%20Australian">The Australian</a>"s Steve Polak wrote that while "Turok" was highly derivative, the game was evidence of the evolution of the genre, offering more graphics and gameplay options. Video game magazine "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" said that "Turok" contradicted the prevailing notion at the time that only Nintendo could create superior games for the console. In contrast, William Burrill of "<a href="The%20Toronto%20Star">The Toronto Star</a>" wrote that "Turok" offered nothing new if players had tried a first-person shooter before, and "Next Generation Online" said that its similar gameplay essentially made the game "a very pretty "Duke Nukem"". The four reviewers of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" remarked that while the graphics and animation are stunning, the controls and level design are lacking. Speaking to <a href="Shacknews">Shacknews</a> in 2007, <a href="Propaganda%20Games">Propaganda Games</a>'s Josh Holmes said that while "<a href="GoldenEye%20007%20%281997%20video%20game%29">GoldenEye 007</a>" is commonly considered the standard-setting console shooter, "Turok" pioneered the console shooter first by offering open environments and deviating from the corridor-based shooters that were the standard until then.

Reviewers found that "Turok"s controls generally worked well. Perry, Scary Larry, and "Next Generation" all noted that while many players would not initially like using the Nintendo 64's <a href="analog%20stick">analog stick</a> for weapon movement, they would become adept at the control scheme. The "Electronic Gaming Monthly" review team, however, said they wished the controls could be reconfigured to a scheme that was easier to master. Polak wrote that the joystick let players aim with a remarkable amount of precision. George Mannes of "The Daily News" found the controls to be easy to learn and simple to keep track of in comparison to PC shooters, but said the joystick control could be disorienting: "the only problem is when you look up in the air and make the slightest twitch to the left or the right, you can end up like a tourist staring up at the Empire State Building and whirling like a <a href="dervish">dervish</a>," he wrote. Reviewers found that the game's included tutorial helped players adapt to the controls.

Critics lauded "Turok"s graphics; while giving the rest of the game a tepid response, Burrill and the "EGM" team both rated the visuals highly. Polak said that the game proved the supremacy of the Nintendo 64's graphics in the console market. Translucent water, destructible trees and lens flares were among the graphical details praised by reviewers. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>"s Tom Ham said that "equally impressive" as the environmental detail were the "true-to-life" animations. "Blow away a baddie and he'll grab his throat, blood splatting, and then fall to the ground, still convulsing," Ham wrote. "How can you put a price on that?" Scary Larry agreed that the gruesome death animations are a highlight of the all-around impressive graphics. The level of gore and blood in the game lead reviewers such as Scary Larry, "The Times"s Tim Wapshott, and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>"s Joseph Szadkowski to caution against letting children play the game. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s <a href="Jeff%20Gerstmann">Jeff Gerstmann</a> noted that the graphics came at a price; if more than a few enemies appeared on screen at the same time, the game's <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a> would slow down. Gerstmann wrote that the <a href="distance%20fog">distance fog</a> used to reduce the slowdown was a "neat effect" as enemies would appear out of the mist "fangs first", although it masked the console's limitations. Perry commented that the inability to look into the distance forced players to rely on the game map. "Next Generation" said that while "Turok" was overall probably the best-looking Nintendo 64 game to date, the limited texture palette causes all the environments to appear similar, making the game disorienting despite the map.

The PC port was not as well received. Colin Williamson commented in "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" that the game's popularity on the Nintendo 64 could in part be attributed to the shortage of games for the system at the time. Like "Next Generation", he said that while the graphics are impressive, the limited textures and constant fog make the game disorienting, and first-person platform jumping does not work. He added that the game's problems are compounded on PC because the conversion failed to add on features that PC gamers take for granted, such as a multiplayer mode and ability to save at any point. "GameSpot"s Tim Soete likewise criticized the PC version's retention of the problems and checkpoint-based save system of the Nintendo 64 version, though he had an overall positive reaction to the game, calling it "a technically arresting adventure." Steve Bauman of "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" reviewed the PC version and said that while it was an excellent port, the game itself was inferior to other shooters such as "<a href="Quake%20%28video%20game%29">Quake</a>".

Worldwide sales of "Turok: Dinosaur Hunter" surpassed $60 million in late June 1997. The game also held the top spot for video game rentals for seven weeks consecutively. Acclaim re-issued the game for the 1997 holiday season due to its sales potential for the increased console player base. "Turok" was later named a Nintendo "<a href="Player%27s%20Choice">Player's Choice</a>" title in 1998—the only third-party Nintendo 64 game to be featured at the time—and ultimately sold about 1.5 million units.

"<a href="NGC%20Magazine">NGC Magazine</a>" wrote that "Turok" changed perceptions of a Nintendo console: "On a machine from a company that had long specialised in primary colours and family fun, the last thing anyone anticipated was the kind of cutting-edge first-person shooter that was previously the sole preserve of expensive gaming PCs." Not only did "Turok" change this, but it established a "system-selling franchise" that persisted even after the N64 was replaced. In addition to "Turok", the "Turok" franchise includes five other games: "" (1998), "" (1999), "" (2000), "" (2002), and "<a href="Turok%20%28video%20game%29">Turok</a>" (2008).

It was announced in August 2015 that <a href="Night%20Dive%20Studios">Night Dive Studios</a> was producing a remastered version of the game, along with "Turok 2", for the PC. The game will include improved graphics as well as "other improvements" based on the original PC ports of the titles. The remaster was released in digital stores on December 17, 2015. In March 2016, Night Dive Studios confirmed that the game would be released for the <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> video game console.

In February 2017, the <a href="source%20code">source code</a> of the N64 version was sold on <a href="Ebay">Ebay</a> for $2551.99 which was found on a SGI <a href="Silicon%20Graphics">Silicon Graphics</a> <a href="SGI%20Indy">Indy</a> development machine which originated from the <a href="Acclaim%20Entertainment">Acclaim Entertainment</a> liquidation.

The remastered game was released on March 18, 2019 for the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a>.

RAF Northolt

RAF Northolt is a <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> station in <a href="South%20Ruislip">South Ruislip</a>, from <a href="Uxbridge">Uxbridge</a> in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Hillingdon">London Borough of Hillingdon</a>, west London, England, approximately north of <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a>. The station handles many private civil flights in addition to Air Force flights. Northolt has one runway in operation, spanning , with a grooved <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a> surface.

Northolt pre-dates the establishment of the Royal Air Force by almost three years, having opened in May 1915, making it the oldest RAF base. Originally established for the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>, it has the longest history of continuous use of any RAF airfield. Before the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the station was the first to take delivery of the <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>. The station played a key role during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>, when fighters from several of its units, including <a href="No.%20303%20Polish%20Fighter%20Squadron">No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron</a>, engaged enemy aircraft as part of the defence of London. It became the first base to have squadrons operating <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> aircraft within German airspace.

During the construction of Heathrow Airport, Northolt was used for commercial civil flights, becoming the busiest airport in Europe for a time and a major base for <a href="British%20European%20Airways">British European Airways</a>. More recently the station has become the hub of British military flying operations in the London area. Northolt has been extensively redeveloped since 2006 to accommodate these changes, becoming home to the <a href="British%20Forces%20Post%20Office">British Forces Post Office</a>, which moved to a newly constructed headquarters and sorting office on the site. Units currently based at RAF Northolt are <a href="No.%2032%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron</a>, the <a href="Queen%27s%20Colour%20Squadron">Queen's Colour Squadron</a>, <a href="No.%20600%20Squadron%20RAF">600 (City of London) Squadron</a>, No 1 Aeronautical Information Documents Unit, the <a href="Air%20Historical%20Branch">Air Historical Branch</a> and the <a href="Central%20Band%20of%20the%20Royal%20Air%20Force">Central Band of the RAF</a>.

Following <a href="Louis%20Bl%C3%A9riot">Louis Blériot</a>'s first flight across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> in 1909, the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> considered the necessity of defending the United Kingdom from a future air attack. By May 1910, <a href="Claude%20Grahame-White">Claude Grahame-White</a> and other aviation pioneers were flying from the flat areas around <a href="Ruislip">Ruislip</a>, although they soon sought an aerodrome for London, which was eventually built <a href="Hendon%20Aerodrome">at Hendon</a>. A proposal was made in 1912 for the area around where RAF Northolt now stands to be developed as "Harrow Aerodrome". The company established to develop the site was listed on the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> but the idea did not progress any further.

The outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> necessitated a new aerodrome for the Royal Flying Corps. The Corps had received the <a href="Royal%20warrant%20%28document%29">Royal Warrant</a> on 13 April 1912, whereupon Major <a href="Sefton%20Brancker">Sefton Brancker</a> of the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> conducted aerial surveys in 1914 of Glebe Farm in <a href="Ickenham">Ickenham</a>, and Hundred Acres Farm and Down Barnes Farm in Ruislip, looking for the most effective operating base for new squadrons. He settled on a site near Northolt Junction railway station; in January 1915 the government requisitioned the land. It is rumoured that the government official tasked with acquiring the land arrived at the site with his map upside down, leading to the government requisitioning and developing land on the wrong side of the railway line, including the old Hill Farm.
Construction of the new aerodrome, to be named "RFC Military School, Ruislip", began in January 1915. It opened on 3 May 1915, becoming known as Northolt and home to No. 4 Reserve Aeroplane Squadron which relocated from <a href="Farnborough%20Airfield">Farnborough</a>. Most early RAF airfields were named after the nearest railway station, in this case Northolt Junction, later named Northolt Halt and now <a href="South%20Ruislip%20station">South Ruislip station</a>; so the airfield became "Northolt" despite being in neighbouring South Ruislip. In the same year the airfield was extended westwards, and aircraft began flying sorties in defence of London against <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> raids. <a href="No.%2018%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 18 Squadron</a> was formed in the same month as Northolt and equipped with Bleriot Experimental biplanes, whose slow speed led to heavy losses in combat with the German <a href="Fliegertruppe">Fliegertruppe</a>.

In 1916, <a href="No.%2043%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 43 Squadron</a> was formed under the command of Major <a href="Sholto%20Douglas%2C%201st%20Baron%20Douglas%20of%20Kirtleside">Sholto Douglas</a>. Aircraft equipping the squadron included the <a href="Sopwith%201%C2%BD%20Strutter">Sopwith 1½ Strutter</a>, built by the <a href="Fairey%20Aviation">Fairey Aviation</a> company, then in <a href="Hayes%2C%20Hillingdon">Hayes</a>. The Strutter made its first test flight from Northolt in 1916 with <a href="Harry%20Hawker">Harry Hawker</a> at the controls. Fairey conducted test flights at Northolt from 1917 until 1928 when the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> gave the company notice to vacate the aerodrome. Flights later resumed from the <a href="Great%20West%20Aerodrome">Great West Aerodrome</a> owned by Fairey in <a href="Harmondsworth">Harmondsworth</a>, which was eventually developed as Heathrow Airport. No. 43 Squadron went on to fly sorties over France from 17 January 1917, taking part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vimy%20Ridge">Battle of Vimy Ridge</a> between 4 and 8 April 1917.

<a href="No.%20600%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 600 Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%20601%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 601 Squadron</a> of the fledgling <a href="Royal%20Auxiliary%20Air%20Force">Royal Auxiliary Air Force</a> were formed at Northolt in 1925 under the command of <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> Lord Edward Grosvenor. Both squadrons were deployed to <a href="RAF%20Hendon">RAF Hendon</a> in 1927, although 600 Squadron returned in 1939. The <a href="Edward%20VIII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince of Wales</a>, later King Edward VIII and subsequently the <a href="Duke%20of%20Windsor">Duke of Windsor</a>, made his first flight in a <a href="Bristol%20F.2%20Fighter">Bristol F.2 Fighter</a> from Northolt on 27 April 1929.

Northolt became an active base during the Second World War for Royal Air Force and <a href="Polish%20Air%20Forces%20in%20Great%20Britain">Polish Air Force</a> squadrons in their defence of the United Kingdom. It was the first RAF station to operate the Hawker Hurricane, with <a href="No.%20111%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 111 Squadron</a> receiving the first four aircraft in December 1937, and reaching its full complement by February 1938. In the lead-up to war, the RAF implemented a policy of adding concrete runways to important airfields; by 1939 Northolt had a new concrete runway. Later in 1939 RAF Hendon became one of its satellite airfields. Polish pilots were taught English at RAF Uxbridge, where they also practised formation flying using tricycles with radios, compasses and speed indicators.

<a href="Battle%20of%20Britain%20Day">On 15 September 1940</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>, No. 1 Squadron <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">RCAF</a>, <a href="No.%20229%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 229 Squadron</a>, <a href="No.%20303%20Polish%20Fighter%20Squadron">No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron</a>, <a href="No.%20504%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 504 Squadron</a>, and part of <a href="No.%20264%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 264 Squadron</a> were based at the station, all under the control of <a href="No.%2011%20Group%20RAF">No. 11 Group RAF</a>, headquartered at <a href="RAF%20Uxbridge">RAF Uxbridge</a>. All flew Hawker Hurricanes except No. 264 Squadron's contingent, which operated the <a href="Boulton%20Paul%20Defiant">Boulton Paul Defiant</a>. During the Battle of Britain, the Polish Squadron shot down the greatest number of enemy aircraft, with its Czech pilot Sergeant <a href="Josef%20Franti%C5%A1ek">Josef František</a> scoring the most "kills". The <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> bombed the airfield in August 1940 as well as other sector airfields in the area, including <a href="RAF%20Biggin%20Hill">Biggin Hill</a>, <a href="RAF%20Hornchurch">Hornchurch</a> and <a href="RAF%20North%20Weald">North Weald</a>, as part of a concentrated effort against the airfields and sector stations of No. 11 Group RAF. A total of 4,000 bombs were recorded as falling within two miles (3 km) of the airfield over a fifteen-month period, although only two were recorded as hitting the airfield itself. Under the leadership of the station commander, <a href="Group%20Captain">Group Captain</a> <a href="Stanley%20Vincent">Stanley Vincent</a>, the airfield was camouflaged to resemble civil housing. Vincent had been concerned that camouflaging the airfield as open land would look too suspicious from the air; Northolt was surrounded by housing and so a large open area would draw attention. A fake stream was painted across the main runway while the hangars were decorated to look like houses and gardens. The result was so effective that pilots flying to Northolt from other airfields often struggled to find it.

Thirty <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> airmen including servicemen from Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, New Zealand, Poland and the United Kingdom were killed flying from RAF Northolt during the Battle of Britain, of whom ten were Polish. The <a href="Polish%20War%20Memorial">Polish War Memorial</a> dedicated to all Polish airmen who lost their lives during the Second World War, stands near the southeastern corner of the airfield. Its name is also commemorated at the adjacent eponymous junction on <a href="Western%20Avenue%20%28London%29">Western Avenue</a>.

Squadrons based at RAF Northolt during the battle shot down a total of 148 Luftwaffe aircraft and damaged 52. A further 25 were claimed by pilots and recorded as "probables". Group Captain Vincent became one of the few RAF airmen to shoot down an enemy aircraft in both World Wars. He was a long-serving RAF man who had claimed an aerial victory over the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in the First World War. By the time of the Battle of Britain he was too old for operational flying. Nevertheless, he took to the skies during one raid and brought down a German aircraft.

After the Battle of Britain, the station remained a base for daytime fighter operations, with <a href="No.%20302%20Polish%20Fighter%20Squadron">No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron</a>, <a href="No.%20229%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 229 Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%20615%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 615 Squadron</a> all arriving before 3 November 1940. <a href="No.%20308%20Polish%20Fighter%20Squadron">No. 308 Polish Fighter Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%20306%20Polish%20Fighter%20Squadron">No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron</a> later joined No. 303 during 1941 to form the No. 1 Polish Fighter Wing. Polish Fighter Squadrons based at Northolt in 1942 took part in <a href="Operation%20Jubilee">Operation Jubilee</a> (the raid on Dieppe) on 19 August alongside Nos. 302 and 308 from nearby <a href="RAF%20Heston">RAF Heston</a>. Reconnaissance squadrons <a href="No.%2016%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 16 Squadron</a> and <a href="No.%20140%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 140 Squadron</a> operating Supermarine Spitfires and <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a>s moved to Northolt in 1944. <a href="No.%2069%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 69 Squadron</a> with their <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a>s modified for photographic reconnaissance arrived later. All three reconnaissance squadrons were combined to form No. 34 (PR) Wing.

In 1943, the station became the first to fly sorties using <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s (Mk IXs) in German airspace in support of bomber operations. On 25 March, <a href="RAF%20Ferry%20Command">RAF Ferry Command</a> became <a href="RAF%20Transport%20Command">RAF Transport Command</a> and thereafter used Northolt as a London base for the transfer of new aircraft from factories to airfields. Runway 26/08 was extended in February that year to accommodate the larger transport aircraft required by the Command. Northolt continued as a Sector Fighter Station until February 1944. As a result of this and the new larger runway, the smaller 02/20 runway closed in April 1944.

RAF Northolt became home to Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s personal aircraft, a modified <a href="Douglas%20C-54%20Skymaster">Douglas C-54 Skymaster</a>, in June 1944. The aircraft was used to fly him to meetings with other Allied leaders. Between 20 and 21 July 1944, a converted <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a> bomber named "Marco Polo" made the first non-stop intercontinental flight, flying from London to Washington, DC, then returning to Northolt from <a href="La%20Guardia%20Airport">La Guardia Airport</a> within 18 hours. In November of the same year, an <a href="Avro%20York">Avro York</a> flew non-stop from Northolt to Cairo in 10 hours and 25 minutes. A new runway, 31/13, was surveyed the following month and built in March 1946.

Starting in 1946 the airfield was used by civil aviation during the construction of nearby Heathrow Airport. During this period, Northolt became a major base for <a href="British%20European%20Airways">British European Airways</a>, which used the nearby Bourne School as its headquarters. Other airlines including <a href="Aer%20Lingus">Aer Lingus</a>, <a href="Alitalia">Alitalia</a>, <a href="Scandinavian%20Airlines%20System">Scandinavian Airlines System</a> and <a href="Swissair">Swissair</a> used the airfield for scheduled services across Europe.

In December 1946, after taking off during a heavy snowstorm, a <a href="Douglas%20Dakota%203">Douglas Dakota 3</a> operated by <a href="Railway%20Air%20Services">Railway Air Services</a>, flying from Northolt to <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="1946%20Railway%20Air%20Services%20Dakota%20crash">crashed onto the roof of a house</a> in <a href="South%20Ruislip">South Ruislip</a>. All the crew and passengers escaped unharmed by climbing through the loft of the house and leaving via the front door. No residents were injured, even though the owner of the house next door was standing at her front gate when the aircraft came down. The owners of the house had not moved in at the time of the crash as they were due to be married a few days later. The house was later named "Dakota Rest", and still stands today.
During 1952 a total of 50,000 air movements were recorded, making the airfield the busiest in Europe. By then the only scheduled airlines were BEA and Aer Lingus. The RAF maintained a presence throughout its use by civil airlines, making it the longest continuously used airfield in the history of the Royal Air Force. En route from Northolt to <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, on 10 January 1952, a civil <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Skytrain</a> operated by Aer Lingus and named "St. Kevin" flew into an area of extreme turbulence caused by a <a href="Lee%20wave">mountain wave</a> generated by <a href="Snowdon">Snowdon</a>. As a result, the plane crashed into a peat bog near <a href="Llyn%20Gwynant">Llyn Gwynant</a> in <a href="Snowdonia">Snowdonia</a>, killing all 20 passengers and three crew in the company's first fatal accident.

Civil flights ceased when the central area at Heathrow opened in 1954 with Northolt reverting to sole military use in May that year. Northolt's operations became constrained by its proximity to the new much larger civil airport at Heathrow. No. 1 Aeronautical Information Documents Unit (AIDU) moved to the station in 1956 from the neighbouring <a href="RAF%20West%20Ruislip">RAF West Ruislip</a> station. The unit had been established in 1953 to provide information on airfields, communications and navigational aids for the benefit of aircraft safety. AIDU was originally under the command of RAF Transport Command but this was moved to Home Command in March 1957.

On 1 June 1960, an <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a> aircraft suffered engine failure soon after take-off from Northolt and crash-landed on top of the nearby <a href="Express%20Dairies">Express Dairies</a> plant in South Ruislip. There were no fatalities. Later that year, on 25 October, a <a href="Pan%20American%20World%20Airways">Pan Am</a> <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a>, heading for Heathrow, mistakenly landed at Northolt with forty-one passengers on board. A <a href="Lufthansa">Lufthansa</a> Boeing 707 also attempted to land at the station on 28 April 1964 but was dissuaded by a red signal flare fired by personnel from Air Traffic Control. In the days before navigational aids such as <a href="Instrument%20Landing%20System">instrument landing systems</a> (ILS) and the <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">global positioning system</a> (GPS) were available, the letters "NO" (for Northolt) and "LH" (for Heathrow) were painted on two <a href="gasometer">gasometer</a>s on the approach to each airfield, one at <a href="Southall">Southall</a> for the approach to Heathrow's diagonal runway (coded 23L) and one at South Harrow for the approach to Northolt's runway (then coded 26), in an effort to prevent a recurrence of such errors. By the 1980s movements of privately owned aircraft, mainly corporate jets, outnumbered military aircraft. Civil flights were limited to 28 per day, with a maximum of 7,000 a year. This limit remained in force in 2008.
Northolt received its first <a href="gate%20guardian">gate guardian</a>, a Spitfire F.<a href="Mark%20%28designation%29">Mk</a> 22, in September 1963. Purchased from the RAF in 1969 for use in the film "<a href="Battle%20of%20Britain%20%28film%29">Battle of Britain</a>", it was replaced by a Spitfire Mk XVI on 2 June 1970. This aircraft remained at the station until its removal on 8 September 1989 for restoration to full flying condition. The <a href="Kermit%20Weeks">Kermit Weeks</a>' <a href="Fantasy%20of%20Flight">Fantasy of Flight</a> Museum in <a href="Polk%20City%2C%20Florida">Polk City</a>, Florida, purchased the aircraft whereupon the station received a <a href="fibreglass">fibreglass</a> replica of a Spitfire Mk IX as a replacement.

Servicing of <a href="No.%2032%20%28The%20Royal%29%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 32 Squadron</a> passed from the RAF to the private company Fields Aviation Services in April 1985, then to Lovaux Aircraft Servicing in 1990. In 1991, the Station Flight was established, taking delivery of two <a href="Britten-Norman%20BN-2%20Islander">Britten-Norman Islanders</a> in December which entered service in January 1992. No. 32 Squadron celebrated its <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee">Diamond Jubilee</a> in 1991, at a time when personnel became involved in operations during the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. <a href="No.%2038%20Group%20RAF">No. 38 Group RAF</a> assumed control of RAF Northolt on 2 November 1992 following a wider restructuring of the RAF. On 16 December 1994, the new southside Operations Building opened, replacing the old Northolt Airport Terminal building. With the reorganisation of <a href="RAF%20Strike%20Command">RAF Strike Command</a> on 1 April 2000, No. 38 Group was disbanded and Northolt came under the control of <a href="No.%202%20Group%20RAF">No. 2 Group RAF</a>.

In August 1996, a Spanish <a href="Learjet">Learjet</a> operated by Mar Aviation overshot runway 25 and collided with a van heading eastward on the <a href="A40%20road">A40</a> Western Avenue; the aircraft was carrying an actress bound for Pinewood Studios in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>. The two pilots, the actress and van driver all suffered minor injuries. The ensuing investigation by the <a href="Civil%20Aviation%20Authority%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Civil Aviation Authority</a>'s <a href="Air%20Accidents%20Investigation%20Branch">Air Accidents Investigation Branch</a> found that both the crew's lack of understanding English and military air traffic control procedures had contributed significantly to the crash. Subsequently, after some thirty years of protracted consideration, an ILS was eventually fitted to Northolt's redefined Runway 25. In addition, <a href="aggregate%20%28composite%29">aggregate</a>-filled safety pits were installed at each end of the runway by 21 January 1998 to protect road users in the event of another <a href="business%20jet">business jet</a> or military transport failing to stop or ascend before the end of the runway. The <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> <a href="Transport%20Select%20Committee">Transport Select Committee</a> considered the conversion of RAF Northolt to a possible offshoot of Heathrow Airport in the 1990s. While the existing runways would cause aircraft to cross the flight paths of those using Heathrow, new parallel runways were suggested. These suggestions were opposed by then <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> for <a href="Ruislip-Northwood%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Ruislip-Northwood</a>, <a href="John%20Wilkinson%20%28British%20politician%29">John Wilkinson</a>, and eventually progressed no further.
Much media attention focused on the airfield when the body of <a href="Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">Diana, Princess of Wales</a>, arrived there from <a href="Villacoublay">Villacoublay</a> airfield, in Paris, France, after <a href="Death%20of%20Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">her death</a> in a car crash in the city on 31 August 1997. The <a href="Queen%27s%20Colour%20Squadron">Queen's Colour Squadron</a>, then based at neighbouring RAF Uxbridge, acted as the bearer party, while the flight was met by the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a>, <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Greater%20London">Lord Lieutenant of Greater London</a>, <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence">Secretary of State for Defence</a>, the RAF Northolt station commander and the RAF Chaplain-in-Chief.

Attention was high again in 2001 when <a href="Ronnie%20Biggs">Ronnie Biggs</a>, the seriously ill, fugitive <a href="Great%20Train%20Robbery%20%281963%29">Great Train Robber</a>, was flown from Brazil to the airfield to be arrested by waiting police officers. Biggs had escaped from custody in 1965; upon his return he was taken to <a href="Belmarsh%20Prison">Belmarsh Prison</a> to complete the remainder of his sentence.

Since 1 June 1998, station commanders have served as <a href="aide-de-camp">aides-de-camp</a> to the Queen. The station received the Freedom of Entry to the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Hillingdon">London Borough of Hillingdon</a> on 11 May 2000. This allowed military personnel to march through the borough in full uniform, an honour granted by the council in light of 2000 being the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain and the 85th anniversary of the opening of RAF Northolt. The neighbouring RAF Uxbridge station had received the same honour in 1960.

The remains of a Hawker Hurricane flown by Flying Officer Ludwik Witold Paszkiewicz, the first pilot in No. 303 Squadron to shoot down an enemy aircraft, were donated to the station in June 2008. During the Battle of Britain, Paszkiewicz became a flying ace and received the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> after shooting down six aircraft. He was killed in action over <a href="Borough%20Green">Borough Green</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a> on 27 September 1940. No. 303 Squadron recorded its 100th kill less than a month after commencing operations. Polish pilot Squadron Leader Franciszek Kornicki, who saw wartime service at RAF Northolt, was reunited with the Supermarine Spitfire he had flown at a special ceremony in September 2010.

An additional memorial to British, Polish, Australian and New Zealand aircrew killed during the Battle of Britain was unveiled in September 2010. In October that year, the hangar which had housed Churchill's personal aircraft, the former Squadron Watch office, and the Operations Block were given <a href="Listed%20building">Grade II listed building status</a>. The Operations Block was a prototype of the "<a href="Hugh%20Dowding%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dowding">Dowding</a> System", which facilitated the chain of command's issuance of orders for the interception of enemy aircraft and a scheme used for the first time during the Battle of Britain. Prior to the listing, the block was renamed the Sir <a href="Keith%20Park">Keith Park</a> Building on 20 September in honour of the former No. 11 Group RAF commander who had also served as station commander at Northolt between 1931 and 1932. RAF Northolt is the only airfield used in the Battle of Britain still operated by the RAF.

In January 2012 it was reported that the future of the station was under review by the Ministry of Defence as part of efforts to reduce defence spending. A proposed use has been as a satellite of Heathrow Airport, although a Ministry of Defence spokesman described that as unlikely.

Four <a href="Eurofighter%20Typhoon">Eurofighter Typhoon</a> aircraft arrived at the station from <a href="RAF%20Coningsby">RAF Coningsby</a> on 2 May 2012 to take part in a security exercise as part of preparations for the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>. During the Games, the aircraft were deployed to the station to provide air superiority protection for London, in conjunction with other security measures by the British Armed Forces. <a href="Westland%20Sea%20King">Westland Sea King</a> helicopters of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> were also deployed to the station. The presence of the aircraft during the Olympics became the first time fighter aircraft had been stationed at RAF Northolt since the Second World War. The Typhoons and Sea Kings left Northolt on 16 August following the conclusion of the Olympics.

The overnight base of the <a href="London%20Air%20Ambulance">London Air Ambulance</a> moved to RAF Northolt from <a href="Denham%20Aerodrome">Denham Aerodrome</a> in February 2013. The flying time from the station to its daytime base at the <a href="Royal%20London%20Hospital">Royal London Hospital</a> in <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> is three minutes shorter than from Denham, which also provides savings for the Air Ambulance charity.

In April 2013 the Ministry of Defence announced a proposal to increase the number of private flights from 7,000 to 12,000 per year as part of plans to increase the income generated by the airfield. The number of flights would be limited to 40 per day, and the increase would be phased in over three years to 2016. The airfield was mostly used for VIP jets, and about 3,800 military flights a year.

The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> launched <a href="Project%20MoDEL">Project MoDEL</a> (Ministry of Defence Estates London) in 2006 to consolidate many of its London-based operations at RAF Northolt. Under the project, <a href="RAF%20Bentley%20Priory">RAF Bentley Priory</a>, RAF Uxbridge, RAF West Ruislip, <a href="RAF%20Eastcote">RAF Eastcote</a> and the <a href="Inglis%20Barracks">Inglis Barracks</a> in <a href="Mill%20Hill">Mill Hill</a> were all closed between 2006 and 2010 with any remaining units transferring to Northolt. The Air Historical Branch, originally established in 1919 to provide a record of air activity during the First World War, was also relocated to RAF Northolt from RAF Bentley Priory in 2008 as part of this project. As a result, the station has been extensively redeveloped with new facilities to support these operations.

The statue, Letter from Home, of a First World War soldier reading a letter was moved from outside Inglis Barracks in Mill Hill to RAF Northolt in June 2007. It is a replica of the statue at <a href="Paddington%20Station">Paddington Station</a> and was first unveiled in 1982. Following the relocation of the <a href="British%20Forces%20Post%20Office">British Forces Post Office</a> and Defence Courier Service from Mill Hill, a new headquarters and main sorting facility were built for their use which opened in November 2007. New hangar facilities for the use of No. 32 Squadron were also constructed, along with new personnel accommodation.

The original 1920s Officers' Mess was refurbished as part of the work, which also saw the relocation of the replica Supermarine Spitfire gate guardian to the passenger terminal, and the unveiling of a new replica Hawker Hurricane gate guardian near the eastern station entrance in September 2010, commemorating the aircrew based at Northolt who had fought in the Battle of Britain.

Upon the closure of RAF Uxbridge, control of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain%20Bunker">Battle of Britain Bunker</a> passed to RAF Northolt to allow continued public visits. In December 2010 it was agreed that the South Hillingdon branch of the <a href="St.%20John%20Ambulance">St. John Ambulance</a> service would move from its existing base in RAF Uxbridge to new premises at Northolt.

The station's new police dog section, featuring kennels and a quarantine building, opened in February 2012, marking the completion of building work.

Olm

The olm or proteus ("Proteus anguinus") is an aquatic <a href="salamander">salamander</a> in the family <a href="Proteidae">Proteidae</a>, the only <a href="Troglobite">exclusively cave-dwelling</a> <a href="chordate">chordate</a> species found in Europe. In contrast to most <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s, it is entirely <a href="aquatic%20animal">aquatic</a>; it eats, sleeps, and breeds underwater. Living in caves found in the <a href="Dinaric%20Alps">Dinaric Alps</a>, it is <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the waters that flow underground through the extensive limestone bedrock of the <a href="Karst%20topography">karst</a> of Central and Southeastern Europe, specifically southern Slovenia, the basin of the <a href="So%C4%8Da">Soča</a> River () near <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>, Italy, southwestern Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. <a href="Introduced%20species">Introduced</a> populations are found near <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a>, Italy, and <a href="Kranj">Kranj</a>, Slovenia.

It is also called the "human fish" by locals because of its fleshy skin color (translated literally from , , /човечја рибица), as well as "cave salamander" or "white salamander". In Slovenia, it is also known by the name "močeril" (from *"močerъ" 'earthworm, damp creepy-crawly' < "moča" 'dampness'). It was first mentioned in 1689 by the local <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> <a href="Valvasor">Valvasor</a> in his "<a href="The%20Glory%20of%20the%20Duchy%20of%20Carniola">Glory of the Duchy of Carniola</a>", who reported that, after heavy rains, the olms were washed up from the underground waters and were believed by local people to be a cave <a href="dragon">dragon</a>'s offspring.

This <a href="cave%20salamander">cave salamander</a> is most notable for its adaptations to a life of complete darkness in its underground habitat. The olm's <a href="eye">eye</a>s are <a href="Vestigiality">undeveloped</a>, leaving it blind, while its other <a href="sense">sense</a>s, particularly those of <a href="olfaction">smell</a> and <a href="hearing%20%28sense%29">hearing</a>, are acutely developed. It also lacks any <a href="biological%20pigment">pigmentation</a> in its <a href="skin">skin</a>. It has three toes on its forelimbs, but only two toes on its hind feet. It also exhibits <a href="neoteny">neoteny</a>, retaining <a href="larva">larva</a>l characteristics like external <a href="gill">gill</a>s into adulthood, like some American amphibians, the <a href="axolotl">axolotl</a> and the mudpuppies ("<a href="Necturus">Necturus</a>"). The olm is the only <a href="species">species</a> in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Proteus" and the only European species of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Proteidae">Proteidae</a>, whose other extant genus is "Necturus".

The word "olm" is a <a href="German%20language">German</a> <a href="loanword">loanword</a> that was incorporated into <a href="English%20language">English</a> in the late 19th century. The origin of the German original, "Olm" or "Grottenolm" 'cave olm', is unclear. It may be a variant of the word "Molch" 'salamander'.

The olm's body is <a href="snake">snake</a>like, long, with some specimens reaching up to . Females grow larger than males, but otherwise the primary external difference between the sexes are in the <a href="cloaca">cloaca</a> region (shape and size) when breeding. The trunk is cylindrical, uniformly thick, and segmented with regularly spaced furrows at the <a href="myomere">myomere</a> borders. The <a href="tail">tail</a> is relatively short, laterally flattened, and surrounded by a thin fin. The limbs are small and thin, with a reduced number of digits compared to other amphibians: the front legs have three digits instead of the normal four, and the rear have two digits instead of five. Its body is covered by a thin layer of skin, which contains very little of the <a href="biological%20pigment">pigment</a> <a href="riboflavin">riboflavin</a>, making it yellowish-white or pink in color. The internal organs can be seen shining through on the abdominal part of the body. 

The resemblance of the color of its skin to that of <a href="white%20people">white people</a> is why the olm is called "human fish" in some languages. However, its skin retains the ability to produce <a href="melanin">melanin</a>, and will gradually turn dark when exposed to light; in some cases the <a href="larva">larva</a>e are also colored. Its pear-shaped head ends with a short, dorsoventrally flattened snout. The mouth opening is small, with tiny <a href="tooth">teeth</a> forming a <a href="sieve">sieve</a> to keep larger particles inside the mouth. The nostrils are so small as to be imperceptible, but are placed somewhat <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Left%20and%20right%20.28lateral.29.2C%20and%20medial">laterally</a> near the end of the snout. The regressed <a href="eye">eye</a>s are covered by a layer of skin. The olm breathes with external <a href="gill">gill</a>s that form two branched tufts at the back of the head. They are red in color because the oxygen-rich <a href="blood">blood</a> shows through the non-pigmented skin. The olm also has rudimentary <a href="lung">lung</a>s, but their role in respiration is only accessory, except during <a href="Hypoxia%20%28environmental%29">hypoxic</a> conditions.

Cave-dwelling animals have been prompted, among other adaptations, to develop and improve non-visual sensory systems in order to orient in and adapt to permanently dark habitats. The olm's sensory system is also adapted to life in the subterranean aquatic environment. Unable to use vision for orientation, the olm compensates with other senses, which are better developed than in amphibians living on the surface. It retains larval proportions, like a long, slender body and a large, flattened head, and is thus able to carry a larger number of <a href="sensory%20receptor">sensory receptor</a>s.

Although blind, the olm swims away from light. The eyes are regressed, but retain sensitivity. They lie deep below the <a href="Dermis">dermis of the skin</a> and are rarely visible except in some younger adults. Larvae have normal eyes, but development soon stops and they start regressing, finally atrophying after four months of development. The <a href="pineal%20body">pineal body</a> also has photoreceptive cells which, though regressed, retain visual pigment like the photoreceptive cells of the regressed eye. The pineal gland in "Proteus" probably possesses some control over the physiological processes. <a href="Ethology">Behavioral</a> experiments revealed that the skin itself is also sensitive to light. Photosensitivity of the integument is due to the pigment <a href="melanopsin">melanopsin</a> inside specialized cells called <a href="melanophore">melanophore</a>s. Preliminary immunocytochemical analyses support the existence of photosensitive pigment also in the animal's integument.

The olm is capable of sensing very low concentrations of organic compounds in the water. They are better at sensing both the quantity and quality of prey by smell than related amphibians. The nasal <a href="epithelium">epithelium</a>, located on the inner surface of the nasal cavity and in the <a href="Jacobson%27s%20organ">Jacobson's organ</a>, is thicker than in other amphibians. The <a href="taste%20buds">taste buds</a> are in the <a href="mucus">mucous</a> epithelium of the mouth, most of them on the upper side of the <a href="tongue">tongue</a> and on the entrance to the gill cavities. Those in the oral cavity are used for tasting food, where those near the gills probably sense chemicals in the surrounding water.

The sensory <a href="epithelia">epithelia</a> of the <a href="inner%20ear">inner ear</a> are very specifically differentiated, enabling the olm to receive <a href="sound">sound</a> waves in the water, as well as <a href="vibration">vibration</a>s from the ground. The complex functional-morphological orientation of the sensory cells enables the animal to register the sound sources. As this animal stays <a href="neotenic">neotenic</a> throughout its long life span, it is only occasionally exposed to normal adult hearing in air, which is probably also possible for Proteus as in most salamanders. Hence, it would be of adaptive value in caves, with no vision available, to profit from underwater hearing by recognizing particular sounds and eventual localization of prey or other sound sources, i.e. acoustical orientation in general. The ethological experiments indicate that the best hearing sensitivity of "Proteus" is between 10 Hz and up to 15,000 Hz. The <a href="lateral%20line">lateral line</a> supplements inner ear sensitivity by registering low-frequency nearby water displacements.

A new type of sensory organ has been analyzed on the head of "Proteus", utilizing light and electron microscopy. These new organs have been described as <a href="ampullary%20organ">ampullary organ</a>s.

Like some other lower <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, the olm has the ability to register weak <a href="electric%20field">electric field</a>s. Some behavioral experiments suggest that the olm may be able to use Earth's <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> to orient itself. In 2002, "Proteus" "anguinus" was found to align itself with natural and artificially modified magnetic fields.

The olm lives in well-oxygenated underground waters with a typical, very stable temperature of , infrequently as warm as . The black olm may occur in surface waters that are somewhat warmer.

At a temperature of , the olm's <a href="embryo">embryo</a>nic development (time in the eggs before hatching) is 140 days, but it is somewhat slower in colder water and faster in warmer, being as little as 86 days at . After hatching, it takes another 14 years to reach sexual maturity if living in water that is . The larvae gain adult appearance after nearly four months, with the duration of development strongly correlating with water temperature. Unconfirmed historical observations of <a href="viviparity">viviparity</a> exist, but it has been shown that the females possess a <a href="gland">gland</a> that produces the egg casing, similar to those of <a href="fish">fish</a> and egg-laying amphibians. <a href="Paul%20Kammerer">Paul Kammerer</a> reported that female olm gave birth to live young in water at or below and laid eggs at higher, but rigorous observations have not confirmed that. The olm appears to be exclusively <a href="ovipary">oviparous</a>.

The female lays up to 70 eggs, each about in diameter, and places them between rocks, where they remain under her protection. The average is 35 eggs and the adult female typically breeds every 12.5 years. The tadpoles are long when they hatch and live on <a href="yolk">yolk</a> stored in the cells of the digestive tract for a month.

Development of the olm and other <a href="troglobite">troglobite</a> amphibians is characterized by <a href="heterochrony">heterochrony</a> – the animal does not undergo <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> and instead retains larval features. The form of heterochrony in the olm is <a href="neoteny">neoteny</a> – delayed <a href="Somatic%20%28biology%29">somatic</a> maturity with precocious reproductive maturity, i.e. reproductive maturity is reached while retaining the larval external <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>. In other amphibians, the metamorphosis is regulated by the <a href="hormone">hormone</a> <a href="thyroxine">thyroxine</a>, secreted by the <a href="thyroid">thyroid</a> gland. The thyroid is normally developed and functioning in the olm, so the lack of metamorphosis is due to the unresponsiveness of key <a href="Tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a> to thyroxine.

The olm swims by eel-like twisting of its body, assisted only slightly by its poorly developed legs. It is a <a href="predator">predator</a>y animal, feeding on small <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s (for example, "<a href="Troglocaris">Troglocaris</a>" shrimp), <a href="snail">snail</a>s and occasionally <a href="insect">insect</a>s. It does not chew its food, instead swallowing it whole. The olm is resistant to long-term starvation, an adaptation to its underground habitat. It can consume large amounts of food at once, and store nutrients as large deposits of <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s and <a href="glycogen">glycogen</a> in the <a href="liver">liver</a>. When food is scarce, it reduces its activity and <a href="metabolism">metabolic rate</a>, and can also reabsorb its own tissues in severe cases. Controlled experiments have shown that an olm can survive up to 10 years without food.

Olms are <a href="Social%20animal">gregarious</a>, and usually aggregate either under stones or in fissures. Sexually active males are an exception, establishing and defending territories where they attract females. The scarcity of food makes fighting energetically costly, so encounters between males usually only involve <a href="Display%20%28zoology%29">display</a>. This is a behavioral adaptation to life underground.

Reproduction has only been observed in captivity so far. Sexually mature males have swollen cloacas, brighter skin color, two lines at the side of the tail, and slightly curled fins. No such changes have been observed in the females. The male can start courtship even without the presence of a female. He chases other males away from the chosen area, and may then secrete a female-attracting <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>. When the female approaches, he starts to circle around her and fan her with his tail. Then he starts to touch the female's body with his snout, and the female touches his cloaca with her snout. At that point, he starts to move forward with a twitching motion, and the female follows. He then deposits the <a href="spermatophore">spermatophore</a>, and the animals keep moving forward until the female hits it with her cloaca, after which she stops and stands still. The spermatophore sticks to her and the <a href="sperm">sperm</a> cells swim inside her cloaca where they attempt to fertilize her eggs. The courtship ritual can be repeated several times over a couple of hours.

Longevity is estimated at up to 58 years. A study published in "<a href="Biology%20Letters">Biology Letters</a>" estimated that they have a maximum lifespan of over 100 years and that the lifespan of an average adult is around 68.5 years. When compared to the longevity and body mass of other amphibians, olms are <a href="outlier">outlier</a>s, living longer than would be predicted from their size.

Olms from different cave systems differ substantially in body measurements, color and some microscopic characters. Earlier researchers used these differences to support the division into five species, while modern herpetologists understand that external morphology is not reliable for amphibian systematics and can be extremely variable, depending on nourishment, illness, and other factors; even varying among individuals in a single <a href="population">population</a>. "Proteus anguinus" is now considered a single species. The length of the head is the most obvious difference between the various populations – individuals from Stična, Slovenia, have shorter heads on average than those from <a href="Tr%C5%BEi%C4%8D">Tržič</a>, Slovenia, and the <a href="Istria">Istria</a>n peninsula, for example.

The black olm ("Proteus anguinus parkelj" ) is the only other recognized subspecies of the olm. It is <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the underground waters near <a href="%C4%8Crnomelj">Črnomelj</a>, Slovenia, an area smaller than . It was first found in 1986 by members of the <a href="Slovenian%20Karst%20Research%20Institute">Slovenian Karst Research Institute</a>, who were exploring the water from <a href="Dobli%C4%8Dica">Dobličica karst spring</a> in the <a href="White%20Carniola">White Carniola</a> region.

It has several features separating it from the <a href="nominotypical%20subspecies">nominotypical subspecies</a> ("Proteus a. anguinus"):
These features suggest that the black olm has probably colonized underground habitats more recently and still retains some nontroglomorphic characteristics.

The first written mention of the olm is in <a href="Johann%20Weikhard%20von%20Valvasor">Johann Weikhard von Valvasor</a>'s "<a href="The%20Glory%20of%20the%20Duchy%20of%20Carniola">The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola</a>" (1689) as a baby <a href="dragon">dragon</a>. Heavy rains of Slovenia would wash the olms up from their subterranean habitat, giving rise to the folklore belief that great dragons lived beneath the Earth's crust, and the olms were the undeveloped offspring of these mythical beasts. In his book Valvasor compiled the local Slovenian folk stories and pieced together the rich mythology of the creature and documented observations of the olm as "Barely a span long, akin to a lizard, in short, a worm and vermin of which there are many hereabouts".

The first researcher to retrieve a live olm was a physician and researcher from <a href="Idrija">Idrija</a>, <a href="Giovanni%20Antonio%20Scopoli">Giovanni Antonio Scopoli</a>, who sent dead specimens and drawings to colleagues and collectors. <a href="Josephus%20Nicolaus%20Laurenti">Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti</a>, though, was the first to briefly describe the olm in 1768 and give it the scientific name "Proteus anguinus". It was not until the end of the century that <a href="Carl%20Franz%20Anton%20Ritter%20von%20Schreibers">Carl Franz Anton Ritter von Schreibers</a> from the <a href="Naturhistorisches%20Museum">Naturhistorisches Museum</a> of <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> started to look into this animal's anatomy. The specimens were sent to him by <a href="%C5%BDiga%20Zois">Žiga Zois</a>. Schreibers presented his findings in 1801 to The <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, and later also in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. Soon, the olm started to gain wide recognition and attract significant attention, resulting in thousands of animals being sent to researchers and collectors worldwide. A Dr Edwards was quoted in a book of 1839 as believing that "...the Proteus Anguinis is the first stage of an animal prevented from growing to perfection by inhabiting the subterraneous waters of Carniola."

In 1880 Marie von Chauvin began the first long-term study of olms in captivity. She learned that they detects prey's motion, panicked when a heavy object was dropped near their habitat, and develop color if exposed to weak light for a few hours a day, but could not cause them to change to a land-dwelling adult form, as she and others had done with <a href="axolotl">axolotl</a>.

The basis of functional morphological investigations in Slovenia was set up by <a href="Lili%20Isteni%C4%8D">Lili Istenič</a> in the 1980s. More than twenty years later, the Research Group for functional morphological Studies of the Vertebrates in the Department of Biology (Biotechnical Faculty, <a href="University%20of%20Ljubljana">University of Ljubljana</a>), is one of the leading groups studying the olm under the guidance of <a href="Boris%20Bulog">Boris Bulog</a>. There are also several cave laboratories in Europe in which olms have been introduced and are being studied. These are <a href="Moulis%2C%20Ari%C3%A8ge">Moulis, Ariège</a> (<a href="France">France</a>), <a href="Kent%27s%20Cavern">Kent's Cavern</a> (<a href="England">England</a>), <a href="Caves%20of%20Han-sur-Lesse">Han-sur-Lesse</a> (<a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>) and <a href="Aggtelek%20%28town%29">Aggtelek</a> (<a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>). They were also <a href="Introduced%20species">introduced</a> into the <a href="Hermannsh%C3%B6hle">Hermannshöhle</a> (<a href="Germany">Germany</a>) and <a href="Oliero">Oliero</a> (<a href="Italy">Italy</a>) caves, where they still live today.

The olm was used by <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> in his famous "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>" as an example for the reduction of structures through disuse:

The olm is extremely vulnerable to changes in its environment, on account of its adaptation to the specific conditions in caves. Water resources in the karst are extremely sensitive to all kinds of pollution. The contamination of the karst underground waters is due to the large number of waste disposal sites leached by rainwater, as well as to the accidental overflow of various liquids. The reflection of such pollution in the karst underground waters depends on the type and quantity of pollutants, and on the rock structure through which the waters penetrate. Self-purification processes in the underground waters are not completely understood, but they are quite different from those in surface waters.

Among the most serious chemical <a href="pollutants">pollutants</a> are chlorinated hydrocarbon <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s, <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>s, polychlorinated biphenyls (<a href="Polychlorinated%20biphenyls">PCBs</a>), which are or were used in a variety of industrial processes and in the manufacture of many kinds of materials; and metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic. All of these substances persist in the environment, being slowly, if at all, degraded by natural processes. In addition, all are toxic to life if they accumulate in any appreciable quantity. Slovenian caves became famous for the animals they contained and which could not be found elsewhere. The olm is illegally taken by collectors.

The olm is included in Appendices II and IV of the <a href="Habitats%20Directive">EU Habitats Directive</a> (92/43/EEC). Appendix II seeks to preserve favorable conservation status in animal and <a href="plant">plant</a> species along with their <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s by protecting the species or defining special areas of conservation. These areas of conservation form the <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a> network. Appendix IV further defines "animal and plant species of community interest in need of strict protection". Hunting or keeping a limited number of olm is allowed only under strictly controlled circumstances, determined by local authorities.

The olm was first protected in Slovenia in 1922 along with all cave fauna, but the protection was not effective and a substantial black market came into existence. In 1982 it was placed on a list of rare and endangered species. This list also had the effect of prohibiting trade of the species. After joining the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, Slovenia had to establish mechanisms for protection of the species included in the EU Habitats Directive. The olm is included in a Slovenian "<a href="Red%20list">Red list</a>" of endangered species. <a href="Postojna%20Cave">Postojna Cave</a> and other caves inhabited by the olm were also included in the Slovenian part of the Natura 2000 network.

In Croatia, the olm is protected by the legislation designed to protect amphibians – collecting is possible only for research purposes by permission of the National Administration for Nature and Environment Protection. Conservation status in <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a> has not yet been defined.

On the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>, the olm is listed as vulnerable because of its fragmented and limited distribution and ever-decreasing population.

The olm is a symbol of Slovenian natural heritage. The enthusiasm of scientists and the broader public about this inhabitant of Slovenian caves is still strong 300 years after its discovery. <a href="Postojna%20Cave">Postojna Cave</a> is one of the birthplaces of <a href="speleology%23Cave%20biology">speleobiology</a> due to the olm and other rare cave inhabitants, such as the <a href="Leptodirus%20hochenwartii">blind cave beetle</a>. The image of the olm contributes significantly to the fame of Postojna Cave, which Slovenia successfully utilizes for the promotion of <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a> in <a href="Postojna">Postojna</a> and other parts of Slovenian karst. Tours of Postojna Cave also include a tour around the speleobiological station – the Proteus <a href="vivarium">vivarium</a>, showing different aspects of the cave environment.

The olm was also depicted on one of the <a href="Slovenian%20tolar">Slovenian tolar</a> coins, and was the namesake of "Proteus", the oldest Slovenian popular science magazine, first published in 1933.

The National Football League Players Association, or NFLPA, is the <a href="Trade%20union">labor organization</a> representing the <a href="American%20football">professional American football</a> players in the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL). The NFLPA, which has headquarters in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, is led by president <a href="Eric%20Winston">Eric Winston</a> and executive director <a href="DeMaurice%20Smith">DeMaurice Smith</a>. Founded in 1956, the NFLPA was established to provide players with formal representation to negotiate compensation and the terms of a <a href="National%20Football%20League%20collective%20bargaining%20agreement">collective bargaining agreement</a> (CBA). The NFLPA is a member of the <a href="AFL%E2%80%93CIO">AFL–CIO</a>, the largest federation of unions in the United States.

In the early years of the NFL, contractual negotiations took place between individual players and management; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining. A series of <a href="Strike%20action">strikes</a> and <a href="Lockout%20%28industry%29">lockouts</a> have occurred throughout the union's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners. League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA. However, the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968, when a CBA was signed. The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011.

In addition to conducting labor negotiations, the NFLPA represents and protects the rights of the players; the organization's actions include filing grievances against player discipline that it deems too severe. The union also ensures that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement are adhered to by the league and the teams. It negotiates and monitors retirement and insurance benefits and enhances and defends the image of players and their profession.

The establishment of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> in 1920 featured early franchises haphazardly formed and often saddled with financial difficulties, poor player talent and attendance rates. As the league expanded through the years, players were provided with no formal representation and received few, if any, benefits. In 1943, <a href="Roy%20Zimmerman%20%28American%20football%29">Roy Zimmerman</a>'s refusal to play an exhibition game without compensation resulted in his trade from the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a>. With the formation of the competing <a href="All-America%20Football%20Conference">All-America Football Conference</a> (AAFC) in 1946, NFL owners instituted a rule which banned a player for five years from NFL-associated employment if he left the league to join the AAFC.

<a href="Bill%20Radovich">Bill Radovich</a>, an offensive lineman, was one player who "jumped" leagues; he played for the <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a> in 1945 and then joined the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dons">Los Angeles Dons</a> of the AAFC after the team offered him a greater salary. Subsequently, Radovich was <a href="blacklisted">blacklisted</a> by the NFL and was denied a tryout with the NFL-affiliated <a href="San%20Francisco%20Seals%20%28baseball%29">San Francisco Seals</a> baseball team of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a>. Unable to attain a job in either league, Radovich filed a lawsuit against the NFL in 1956. The case, "<a href="Radovich%20v.%20National%20Football%20League">Radovich v. National Football League</a>," made its way to the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> in January 1957, with the court ruling that the NFL constituted a business under American antitrust law and did not enjoy the same immunity accorded to <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>. This ruling "set the foundation for a series of court battles" over compensation and employment conditions.

The NFLPA began when two players from the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, <a href="Abe%20Gibron">Abe Gibron</a> and <a href="Dante%20Lavelli">Dante Lavelli</a>, approached a lawyer and former <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">Notre Dame</a> football player, <a href="Creighton%20Miller">Creighton Miller</a>, to help form an association to advocate for the players. Miller was initially reluctant but accepted in 1956. He contacted <a href="Don%20Shula">Don Shula</a> (a <a href="Baltimore%20Colts%20%281953-1983%29">Baltimore Colts</a> player at the time), <a href="Joe%20Schmidt%20%28American%20football%29">Joe Schmidt</a> of the Detroit Lions, <a href="Frank%20Gifford">Frank Gifford</a> and <a href="Sam%20Huff">Sam Huff</a> of the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a>, and <a href="Norm%20Van%20Brocklin">Norm Van Brocklin</a> of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a> to aid in the development of the association. 

By November 1956 a majority of the players signed cards allowing the NFLPA to represent them. Players for 11 of the 12 teams in the league voted to join the new association, with the <a href="Chicago%20Bears">Chicago Bears</a> being the sole holdout.

An initial meeting was convened at the <a href="Waldorf-Astoria%20Hotel">Waldorf-Astoria Hotel</a> in November 1956 where players decided on demands to be submitted to league commissioner <a href="Bert%20Bell">Bert Bell</a>. One particularly sore point involved the lack of compensation for <a href="Training%20camp%20%28National%20Football%20League%29">training camp</a> and preseason <a href="exhibition%20games">exhibition games</a>; while owners charged admission and benefitted from a lucrative series of preseason games, no contract payment was made until a player made a regular season roster. Players would work for up to eight weeks, risking season- or career-ending injury without pay.

The new association's initial agenda also included a league-wide minimum salary, plus a "<a href="per%20diem">per diem</a>" when teams were on the road, a requirement that uniforms and equipment be paid for and maintained at the clubs' expense, and continued payment of salaries when players were injured. The NFLPA hoped to meet with Bell during the owners' meeting in January 1957 to discuss the demands; however, no meeting took place. 

The owners, for their part, were immediately antagonistic to the concept of a player's union — a position epitomized when Miller, then an assistant coach with the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, was removed from the team's annual photo at the insistence of head coach and general manager <a href="Paul%20Brown">Paul Brown</a>. Miller and other union founders were taken aback by Paul Brown's staunch view that "it was both just and necessary that management could cut, trade, bench, blackball, and own in perpetuity anyone and everyone that it wanted".

Miller continued to represent the NFLPA in their early days. Unable to win the owners' attention by forming the union, the NFLPA threatened to bring an <a href="United%20States%20antitrust%20law">antitrust lawsuit</a> against the league. The antitrust laws are meant to protect "free and fair competition in the marketplace" and prohibit practices that may give industries or businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors. 

Rather than face another lawsuit, the owners agreed to a league minimum salary of $5,000, $50 for each exhibition game played, and medical and hospital coverage. Although most of the NFLPA's requests were met, the owners did not enter into a collective bargaining agreement with the association or formally recognize it as the players' exclusive bargaining representative, instead agreeing to change the standard player contract and alter governing documents to reflect the deal.

From the inception of the NFLPA, its members were divided over whether it should act as a <a href="professional%20association">professional association</a> or a <a href="Labor%20union">union</a>. Against the wishes of NFLPA presidents <a href="Pete%20Retzlaff">Pete Retzlaff</a> and <a href="Bernie%20Parrish">Bernie Parrish</a>, Miller ran the association as a "'grievance committee'" rather than engaging in collective bargaining. The standard <a href="collective%20bargaining%20agreement">collective bargaining agreement</a> (CBA) is a contract between organized workers and management that determines the wages and hours worked by employees and can also determine the scope of one's work and what benefits employees receive. The association continued to use the threat of antitrust litigation over the next few years as a lever to gain better benefits, including a pension plan and health insurance. 

In the 1960s the NFL also faced competition from the new <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a> (AFL). NFL players viewed the new league as potential leverage for them to improve their contracts. The NFL tried to discourage this idea by changing the owner-controlled <a href="pension">pension</a> plan to add a provision saying that a player would lose his pension if he went to another league.

On January 14, 1964, players in the newer league formed the AFL Players Association, and elected <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a> <a href="Tom%20Addison">Tom Addison</a> of the <a href="Boston%20Patriots">Boston Patriots</a> as president. Rather than working with the AFLPA, the NFLPA chose to remain apart and tried to block the merger between the two leagues in 1966, though lack of funding prevented it from mounting a formal challenge. With the merger complete, the players could no longer use the leverage of being able to sign with an AFL team to attain more money.

Parrish, upset with the ineffectiveness of the association, proposed forming a players' union, that would be independent of the NFLPA, with the assistance of the <a href="International%20Brotherhood%20of%20Teamsters">International Brotherhood of Teamsters</a> (IBT). The IBT pushed for the NFLPA to join the trucking union. In early November 1967, Parrish, with support from former Cleveland Browns player <a href="Jim%20Brown">Jim Brown</a>, began distributing union cards to form a Teamsters affiliate known as the American Federation of Pro Athletes. The NFLPA rejected the overture at its meeting in <a href="Hollywood%2C%20Florida">Hollywood, Florida</a>, during the first week of January 1968 and declared itself an <a href="independent%20union">independent union</a>. Although Parrish's proposal was defeated, Miller left his position as counsel to the union. He was later replaced by two <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> labor lawyers, <a href="Dan%20Schulman">Dan Schulman</a> and <a href="Bernie%20Baum">Bernie Baum</a>.

Six months after the NFLPA declared itself an independent union, many players were dissatisfied with the lack of compensation teams provided and voted to <a href="strike%20action">strike</a> on July 3, 1968, after official discussions with the owners stalled. The owners countered by declaring a <a href="Lockout%20%28industry%29">lockout</a>. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end. Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.

As the merger of the AFL and NFL became effective in 1970, the unions agreed to meet for the first time in January of that year. The NFL players wanted <a href="Ed%20Meador">Ed Meador</a>—who was the president-elect of the NFLPA prior to the merger—to become president of the newly combined association while the AFL players wanted <a href="Jack%20Kemp">Jack Kemp</a>. The compromise was <a href="John%20Mackey%20%28American%20football%29">John Mackey</a> of the Baltimore Colts, an NFL team before the merger, which was grouped with former AFL teams in the <a href="American%20Football%20Conference">American Football Conference</a>. The AFL players agreed to Mackey's election on the condition that former AFL player <a href="Alan%20Miller%20%28American%20football%29">Alan Miller</a> would become general counsel. Though the NFL owners were open to recognizing the union, their representatives requested lawyers not be present during negotiations, something the players were unwilling to agree to. This prompted the players to petition the <a href="National%20Labor%20Relations%20Board">National Labor Relations Board</a> (NLRB) for union certification.

The players went on strike on July 13, 1970, after the owners locked them out for a brief period. The strike lasted for two days ending with a new four year CBA which was reached after the owners threatened to cancel the season. Due to the new agreement, the union won the right for players to bargain through their own agents with the clubs, and minimum salaries were increased to $12,500 for rookies and $13,000 for veterans. Also, players' pensions were improved and dental care was added to the players' insurance plans. Players also gained the right to select representation on the league's retirement board and the right to impartial <a href="arbitration">arbitration</a> for injury grievances. Following the 1970 agreement, many union representatives were released by their teams. Unfazed, the players were determined to create a stronger union through better communication. Attorney <a href="Ed%20Garvey">Ed Garvey</a> was hired by the NFLPA in 1971 to act as their first executive director, and the NFLPA became officially certified as a union by the NLRB the same year. Headquarters were established in Washington, D.C. and a campaign was launched to help inform players of their rights.

The NFLPA challenged the so-called "Rozelle Rule" as a violation of federal antitrust laws in a lawsuit filed by president <a href="John%20Mackey%20%28American%20football%29">John Mackey</a> and allied union leaders in 1971. The rule, named after commissioner <a href="Pete%20Rozelle">Pete Rozelle</a>, allowed the commissioner to award compensation, which included players, to a team losing a free agent if both the signing team and the team the player was departing could not come to an agreement on compensation. This rule limited player movement, as few teams were willing to sign high-profile <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a>s only to risk having their rosters raided. With the 1970 CBA agreement set to expire, the players went on strike on July 1, 1974. In addition to the "Rozelle Rule", the players demanded the elimination of the <a href="Reserve%20clause%23NFL">option clause</a>, impartial arbitration of disputes, elimination of the draft and waiver system and individual, rather than uniform contracts.

The strike lasted until August 10, 1974 when the players returned to training camp without a new CBA, instead choosing to pursue free agency through the "Mackey" lawsuit filed three years before. While the courts ruled in favor of the players in 1976, the union found that making progress in bargaining was more difficult to achieve. The Rozelle Rule was invalidated by the court which found it constituted a <a href="refusal%20to%20deal">refusal to deal</a> and was therefore in violation of the <a href="Sherman%20Act">Sherman Act</a> as it deterred franchises from signing free agents. However, the change did not achieve true free agency as compensation remained tied to draft picks that were awarded based on the salary of the departing free agent and teams still maintained a <a href="right%20of%20first%20refusal">right of first refusal</a>. The NFL and NFLPA agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement in March 1977 that ran until 1982.

The 1982 NFL strike began on September 21, 1982, and lasted 57 days, ending on November 16, 1982. During this time, no NFL games were played. The strike occurred because the union demanded that a wage scale based on percentage of <a href="gross%20revenue">gross revenue</a>s be implemented. The NFLPA wanted the percentage to be 55 percent, and according to the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", this demand "dominated the negotiations."

During the strike, the NFLPA promoted two "AFC-NFC 'all-star' games." One was held at <a href="RFK%20Stadium">RFK Stadium</a> in <a href="Washington%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a> on October 17, 1982, and the second was held at the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Memorial%20Coliseum">Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum</a> a day later. One of the few stars who did play, future Hall of Fame running back <a href="John%20Riggins">John Riggins</a>, explained "I guess I'll do just about anything for money." Despite a local <a href="Blackout%20%28broadcasting%29">TV blackout</a> and ticket prices starting at six dollars, neither game drew well; only 8,760 fans attended in Washington, D.C., and just 5,331 attended in Los Angeles. With no NFL games to air, <a href="CBS">CBS</a> replayed the <a href="1982%20Super%20Bowl">previous Super Bowl</a> and aired <a href="Division%20III%20%28NCAA%29">Division III</a> football; <a href="Pat%20Summerall">Pat Summerall</a> and <a href="John%20Madden">John Madden</a>, for example, covered a game between <a href="Baldwin%20Wallace%20Yellow%20Jackets">Baldwin Wallace</a> and <a href="Wittenberg%20Tigers%20football">Wittenberg</a>. <a href="NBC">NBC</a> acquired the rights to <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a> games from <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, and aired them with NFL-like production values; the first four games it showed were all <a href="blowout%20%28sports%29">blowout</a>s, however, with poor ratings, and the network gave up.

The 1982 strike ended with a players' revolt against their own union, as some members suggested that Garvey step down as executive director. As a result of the strike, the <a href="1982%20NFL%20season">season schedule</a> was reduced from 16 games to 9 and the playoffs expanded to 16 teams (eight from each conference) for a "Super Bowl tournament." A new five-year agreement was ratified, providing severance packages to players upon retirement, an increase in salaries and post-season pay, and bonuses based on the number of years of experience in the league. Additionally, the NFLPA was allowed to receive copies of all player contracts.<ref name="Van Note/Condon"></ref>

In 1983, former <a href="Oakland%20Raider">Oakland Raider</a> <a href="Gene%20Upshaw">Gene Upshaw</a> became the executive director of the NFLPA. During his tenure, he oversaw a player strike, several antitrust lawsuits, and the collective bargaining agreement of 1993.

The NFLPA went on strike for a month in 1987 upon the expiration of the 1982 CBA; the league's free-agent policy was the major matter in dispute. This time, however, the strike only canceled one week of <a href="1987%20NFL%20season">the season</a>. For three weeks, the NFL staged games with hastily assembled replacement teams, made up principally of players cut during training camp and players left out of work from the closure of the <a href="United%20States%20Football%20League">United States Football League</a> two years prior (along with, to a lesser extent, the <a href="Montreal%20Alouettes">Montreal Alouettes</a> of the <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">CFL</a>, who had folded just three months prior to the strike). They were joined by a few veterans who crossed the picket lines, including <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a> defensive end <a href="Mark%20Gastineau">Mark Gastineau</a>, <a href="Dallas%20Cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> defensive tackle <a href="Randy%20White%20%28American%20football%29">Randy White</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> quarterback <a href="Joe%20Montana">Joe Montana</a>, <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> quarterback <a href="Doug%20Flutie">Doug Flutie</a>, and <a href="Seattle%20Seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> wide receiver <a href="Steve%20Largent">Steve Largent</a>.

Given the willingness of the players to cross the picket lines and networks to broadcast the replacement games, despite a 20% drop in television viewership and even steeper drops in attendance, the union failed to achieve their demands. The strike ended on October 15, 1987, without a collective bargaining agreement in place. The union filed a new antitrust lawsuit on December 30 asking federal judge <a href="David%20S.%20Doty">David Doty</a> to overturn the league's restricting free agent policies.

On November 1, 1989, the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeals">Court of Appeals</a> rejected the suit on the grounds that the owners were covered by the labor exemption from antitrust law. The union's next tactic, in November 1989, was to disclaim any interest in representing NFL players in collective bargaining and to reform itself as a professional organization. Having done that, individual players, led by <a href="Freeman%20McNeil">Freeman McNeil</a> of the New York Jets, brought a new antitrust action, challenging the NFL's so-called "<a href="Plan%20B%20free%20agency">Plan B</a>" free agency, which gave teams a right of first refusal to sign a player, as an unlawful practice under the antitrust acts.

The players ultimately prevailed after a jury trial on their claims. That verdict, the pendency of other antitrust cases and the threat of a <a href="class%20action">class action</a> lawsuit filed by <a href="Reggie%20White">Reggie White</a>, then with the <a href="Philadelphia%20Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a>, on behalf of all NFL players caused the parties to settle the antitrust cases and to agree on a formula that permitted free agency. In return, the owners received a <a href="salary%20cap">salary cap</a>, albeit one tied to a formula based on the players' share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floor—minimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay. The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil antitrust case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 30–2 to accept the NFLPA's final proposal.

Following the death of Gene Upshaw in 2008, <a href="Richard%20Berthelsen">Richard Berthelsen</a> was named interim executive director, serving from August 2008 until March 2009. The NFLPA Board of Representatives elected <a href="DeMaurice%20Smith">DeMaurice Smith</a> for a three-year term as the executive director on March 16, 2009. Smith has been largely praised for his work ethic by the media, current and former players and colleagues as director and for making the union more professional despite the resentment of some players who found his leadership style to be too controlling. Smith's contract was renewed for an additional three years in March 2012. He was elected for a third term in March 2015. The major issue of Smith's tenure has been the <a href="2011%20NFL%20lockout">2011 lockout</a>; former offensive lineman <a href="Chester%20Pitts">Chester Pitts</a> praised Smith for fiercely fighting for the players' rights during negotiations.

In May 2008, the owners decided to opt out of the 1993 arrangement, per the agreement with the players, with the termination to follow a year with no salary cap in 2010. By the CBA's expiration in March 2011, the NFLPA and the NFL had not yet come to terms on a new agreement. The owners were expected to lock out the players upon termination of the agreement. However, the NFLPA filed papers to decertify as a union on March 11, 2011, and filed an antitrust suit to enjoin the lockout with lead plaintiffs quarterbacks <a href="Tom%20Brady">Tom Brady</a>, <a href="Peyton%20Manning">Peyton Manning</a>, and <a href="Drew%20Brees">Drew Brees</a>. U.S. District Court judge <a href="Susan%20Richard%20Nelson">Susan Richard Nelson</a> granted the players' request to end the owners' lockout on April 25. The league asked Nelson to stay the order while they appealed to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Eighth%20Circuit">Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>; Nelson refused. On April 29, the Eighth Circuit granted the league a temporary stay of Nelson's ruling; the league reinstated the lockout the same day. The Eighth Circuit <a href="vacated%20judgment">vacated</a> Nelson's ruling on July 8, affirming the legitimacy of the lockout. During the lockout, players were barred from using team facilities and contacting team coaches; many organized their own workout regimens.

The parties settled the lawsuit on July 25, 2011, and a majority of players signed union authorization cards. The NFL officially recognized the NFLPA's status as the players' collective bargaining representative on July 30, 2011. The NFL and NFLPA proceeded to negotiate terms for a new collective bargaining agreement, and the agreement became effective after ratification by the players August 4, 2011. Under the agreement, which runs through 2021, revenue sharing, the most contentious issue during the lockout, was re-designed so that the players must receive at least 47% of all revenue in salary for the term of the agreement. Additionally, a limit was placed on the amount of money given to rookies. Fifty million dollars was set aside annually for medical research and approximately $1 billion would be set aside for retired player benefits over the life of the agreement.

The NFLPA, on behalf of <a href="Will%20Smith%20%28American%20football%29">Will Smith</a>, <a href="Scott%20Fujita">Scott Fujita</a> and <a href="Anthony%20Hargrove">Anthony Hargrove</a>, three players suspended due to the <a href="Bountygate">Bountygate</a> investigation by the NFL, filed a lawsuit against the league. The investigation found that <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a> players were allegedly paid bonuses for hits that injured opposing players. The players' lawsuit claimed NFL commissioner <a href="Roger%20Goodell">Roger Goodell</a> "had violated the league's labor agreement by showing he had pre-determined the guilt of the players punished in the bounty probe before serving as the arbitrator for their June 18 appeal hearing". The suspensions were unanimously overturned by a three-member appeals panel; however, the ruling did not permanently void their suspensions. The NFL appointed former commissioner <a href="Paul%20Tagliabue">Paul Tagliabue</a> to review the NFL's sanctions against the players, which he overturned.

The league and the NFLPA approved updated <a href="substance%20abuse">substance abuse</a> and <a href="performance-enhancing%20drugs">performance-enhancing substance</a> policies in September 2014. The regulations include <a href="human%20growth%20hormone">human growth hormone</a> testing and amended rules on <a href="DUI">DUI</a>s and <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a>. Third-party <a href="arbitration">arbitration</a> will handle appeals. The deal lifted suspensions for some players the week it was approved. The NFL began testing players for HGH the next month.

According to NFLPA's Department of Labor records since 2006, when membership classifications were first reported, around 60%, or almost two thirds, of the union's membership are classified as "former players," and not eligible to vote in the union, "because, as a matter of federal law, they cannot be members of the collective bargaining unit." The other, voting eligible, classifications are "active players" and "associates." As of 2014 this accounts for 3,130 "former player" members (59% of total), 1,959 "active players" (37%), and 207 "associate" members (4%).

The current president of the NFLPA is <a href="Eric%20Winston">Eric Winston</a> and the executive director is DeMaurice Smith. As of <a href="2017%20NFL%20season">2017</a>, the executive committee consists of the following current and retired NFL players: <a href="Adam%20Vinatieri">Adam Vinatieri</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Watson">Benjamin Watson</a>, <a href="Brian%20Waters">Brian Waters</a>, <a href="Lorenzo%20Alexander">Lorenzo Alexander</a>, <a href="Mark%20Herzlich">Mark Herzlich</a>, <a href="Matt%20Hasselbeck">Matt Hasselbeck</a>, <a href="Richard%20Sherman%20%28American%20football%29">Richard Sherman</a>, <a href="Ryan%20Wendell">Ryan Wendell</a>, <a href="Sam%20Acho">Sam Acho</a>, <a href="Shaun%20Suisham">Shaun Suisham</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Davis%20%28American%20football%29">Thomas Davis</a> and <a href="Zak%20DeOssie">Zak DeOssie</a>. Each NFL team also has a player representative, along with two to three alternate representatives.

Percheron

The Percheron is a breed of <a href="draft%20horse">draft horse</a> that originated in the <a href="Huisne">Huisne</a> river valley in western France, part of the former <a href="Perche">Perche</a> province from which the breed takes its name. Usually <a href="gray%20%28horse%29">gray</a> or <a href="black%20%28horse%29">black</a> in color, Percherons are well muscled, and known for their intelligence and willingness to work. Although their exact origins are unknown, the ancestors of the breed were present in the valley by the 17th century. They were originally <a href="horse%20breeding">bred</a> for use as <a href="war%20horse">war horse</a>s. Over time, they began to be used for pulling <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a>es and later for agriculture and hauling heavy goods. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian</a> blood was added to the breed. Exports of Percherons from France to the United States and other countries rose exponentially in the late 19th century, and the first purely Percheron <a href="stud%20book">stud book</a> was created in France in 1883.

Before World War I, thousands of Percherons were shipped from France to the United States, but after the war began, an <a href="embargo">embargo</a> stopped shipping. The breed was used extensively in Europe during the war, with some horses being shipped from the US back to France to help in the war effort. Beginning in 1918, Percherons began to be bred in Great Britain, and in 1918 the British Percheron Horse Society was formed. After a series of name and studbook ownership changes, the current US Percheron <a href="Breed%20registry">registry</a> was created in 1934. In the 1930s, Percherons accounted for 70 percent of the draft horse population in the United States, but their numbers declined substantially after . However, the population began to recover and as of 2009, around 2,500 horses were registered annually in the United States alone. The breed is still used extensively for draft work, and in France they are used for <a href="horse%20meat">food</a>. They have been crossed with several light horse breeds to produce horses for range work and competition. <a href="Purebred">Purebred</a> Percherons are used for forestry work and pulling carriages, as well as work under saddle, including competition in <a href="English%20riding">English riding</a> disciplines such as <a href="show%20jumping">show jumping</a>.

The size considered ideal for the Percheron varies between countries. In France, height ranges from and weight from . Percherons in the United States generally stand between , with a range of . American Percherons average , and their top weight is around . In Great Britain, is the shortest acceptable height for stallions and for mares, while weights range from around for stallions and for mares. They are generally <a href="gray%20%28horse%29">gray</a> or <a href="black%20%28horse%29">black</a> in coloring, although the American registry also allows the registration of <a href="roan%20%28horse%29">roan</a>, <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> and <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> horses. Only gray or black horses may be registered in France and Britain. Many horses have <a href="horse%20markings">white markings</a> on their heads and legs, but registries consider excessive white to be undesirable.
The head has a straight profile, broad forehead, large eyes and small ears. The chest is deep and wide and the <a href="rump%20%28animal%29">croup</a> long and level. The feet and legs are clean and heavily muscled. The overall impression of the Percheron is one of power and ruggedness. Enthusiasts describe the temperament as proud and alert, and members of the breed are considered intelligent, willing workers with good dispositions. They are considered <a href="easy%20keeper">easy keeper</a>s and adapt well to many conditions and climates. In the 19th century, they were known to travel up to a day at a <a href="trot%20%28horse%20gait%29">trot</a>. Horses in the French registry are branded on the neck with the intertwined letters "SP", the initials of the "Société Hippique Percheronne".

The Percheron breed originated in the <a href="Huisne">Huisne</a> river valley in France, which <a href="River%20source">arises</a> in <a href="Orne">Orne</a>, part of the former <a href="Perche">Perche</a> province, from which the breed gets its name. Several theories have been put forth as to the ancestry of the breed, though its exact origins are unknown. One source of <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation bloodstock</a> may have been mares captured by from the <a href="Bretons">Bretons</a> some time after 496 AD, and another may have been <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian</a> stallions brought to the area by Muslim invaders in the 8th century. Other possibilities are captured <a href="Moors">Moorish</a> cavalry horses from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tours">Battle of Poitiers</a> in 732 AD, some of which were taken by warriors from Perche. A final theory posits that the Percheron and the <a href="Boulonnais%20horse">Boulonnais</a> breed are closely related, and that the Boulonnais influenced the Percheron when they were brought to <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> as reinforcements for the legions of <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Caesar</a>. It is known that during the 8th century, Arabian <a href="stallion">stallion</a>s were crossed with <a href="mare">mare</a>s native to the area, and more <a href="Oriental%20horse">Oriental horse</a> blood was introduced by the <a href="Lords%2C%20counts%20and%20dukes%20of%20Perche">Comte du Perche</a> upon his return from the <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a> and expeditions into territory claimed by Spain. Blood from <a href="Iberian%20horse">Spanish breeds</a> was added when <a href="Rotrou%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Perche">Rotrou III</a> imported horses from <a href="Castile%20%28historical%20region%29">Castile</a>. No matter the theory of origin, breed historians agree that the terrain and climate of the Perche area had the greatest influence on the development of the breed. A possible reference to the horse is made in the 13th-century romance "<a href="Guillaume%20de%20Dole">Guillaume de Dole</a>", in which the title character asks for "the Count of Perche's horse" to be made ready, possibly indicating the "'great horse,' which could accommodate an armored knight" and was bred in the geographical setting of the poem.

During the 17th century, horses from Perche, the ancestors of the current Percheron, were smaller, standing between high, and more agile. These horses were almost uniformly gray; paintings and drawings from the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> generally show French knights on mounts of this color. After the days of the <a href="knight">armored knight</a>, the emphasis in horse breeding was shifted so as to develop horses better able to pull heavy stage coaches at a fast trot. Gray horses were preferred because their light coloring was more visible at night. This new type of horse was called the "Diligence Horse", because the stage coaches they pulled were named "diligences". After the stage coach was replaced by rail, the modern Percheron type arose as a slightly heavier horse for use in agriculture and heavy hauling work moving goods from docks to railway terminals.

Arabian stallions were made available to Percheron breeders for use in breeding army mounts, beginning in 1760 at the royal stud at <a href="Le%20Pin%2C%20Seine-et-Marne">Le Pin</a>. Between 1789 and the early 1800s, the Percheron was in danger of becoming extinct as horse breeding was suppressed during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and its aftermath. Early histories of the breed point to two gray Arabian stallions from Le Pin, Godolphin and Gallipoly, as the blood that helped to restart Percheron breeding. However, later research found that Godolphin was a <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> Arabian of ordinary conformation and no special worth, while Gallipoly was a gray saddle horse of unknown breeding. Modern breed historians contest that there was enough breeding stock left after the early 19th century to restart the breed without further Arabian influence, and state that it is unlikely that two horses of unremarkable breeding and conformation had a significant influence on the breed. Jean le Blanc, a <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">founding stallion</a> of the Percheron breed, was <a href="foal">foal</a>ed in 1823. Today, all Percherons trace their ancestry to this stallion. At this time the breed also became larger, with horses from other French districts being imported to Perche to change the Percheron from a coach horse averaging to a draft horse averaging . In 1893, the first Percheron <a href="stud%20book">stud book</a> was created in France. By 1910, French registrations had risen to almost 32,000 horses. Between 1880 and 1920, Percheron breeders in France exported horses all over the world, including South Africa, South America, Australia and North America.

Percherons were first imported into the United States in 1839, although only one of the initial four horses survived the ocean trip. Soon after, two <a href="stallion">stallion</a>s and two <a href="mare">mare</a>s were imported; one mare died shortly after arrival and one stallion went blind and was retired within a year. Although the first importations of Percherons were less than successful, the remaining stallion, named Diligence, was credited with siring almost 400 foals. In 1851, three stallions were imported: , Louis and Gray Billy. Throughout their stud careers, each had significant influence on American draft horse stock. In the mid-19th century in the United States, Percheron stallions were crossed with homebred mares to improve the local stock, resulting in thousands of <a href="crossbred">crossbred</a> horses. After the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> in the 1860s greatly reduced the number of horses, there was a significant need for large draft horses, especially in growing cities and in the expanding West. Large numbers of Percherons were imported to the United States beginning in the early 1870s, and they became popular with draft horse breeders and owners. In the 1880s, approximately 7,500 horses were exported to the United States. This extensive importation lasted until 1893, when the US experienced a <a href="Panic%20of%201893">financial panic</a>, and virtually no Percheron imports occurred between 1894 and 1898. In addition, many existing horses were lost as people were too poor to purchase or care for large draft horses. In 1898, importations began again as abruptly as they had ceased, with an average of 700 horses a year imported between 1898 and 1905. In 1906 alone, over 13,000 horses were imported to the United States from France. In the American <a href="traveling%20circus">traveling circus</a>es of the late 19th century and early 20th century, the Percheron was the most frequently seen draft horse. Drivers appreciated the breed's agility, stamina and quick-footed <a href="horse%20gait">gait</a>.

In 1876, the Norman-Percheron Association was formed by a group of Percheron breeders in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and at the same time the stud book was begun. The Norman-Percheron Association was the United States' first <a href="purebred">purebred</a> livestock association. In 1877, the word "Norman" was dropped from the name. Later, in the panic of 1893, the Percheron Association went bankrupt and ceased to function. In 1905, also in Chicago, Percheron breeders met again to reform as the Percheron Society of America. Since 1934, the group has been known as the Percheron Horse Association of America. At its height, the organization was the largest draft horse association in the world, in the early 20th century registering over 10,000 horses annually.

In the late 19th century, Percherons also began to be exported from the United States to Great Britain, where they were used to pull horse-drawn buses in large cities. The first Percherons imported to Britain included some of the thousands of crossbreds from the United States. In Britain, many of the horses, once they finished their bus-pulling career, were sold to farmers. Other imported horses were sold to the British Army, and in 1900, 325 horses were shipped to South Africa for use in the <a href="Boer%20War">Boer War</a>.

In 1911, the French society <a href="closed%20stud%20book">restricted registration</a> to horses with both parents already registered with the society. In the early 20th century, the Percheron was one of the four major draft horse breeds, along with the <a href="Belgian%20horse">Belgian</a>, the <a href="Clydesdale%20horse">Clydesdale</a> and the <a href="Shire%20horse">Shire</a>. Breeders could sell their horses for significant amounts of money, especially in the United States and Canada, where breeding stock brought a premium price.
Prior to , a flourishing trade route for Percherons existed between <a href="Nogent-le-Rotrou">Nogent-le-Rotrou</a>, <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> and the United States. However, after the war began, an embargo was placed on French Percherons, disallowing them from exportation. Other than an exception in April 1916 to allow 59 horses to be shipped from France to the US, this embargo remained in place until the end of the war. The war took its toll on the Percheron breed as horses, fodder, and handlers were requisitioned for the fighting, and even after the embargo was lifted France did not have the quality or quantity of stock to fulfill the needs of American breeders. The embargo created a breeding boom in the US, replacing the previous practice of importing the majority of Percherons from France, and late in the war horses were shipped the other way – from the US to Europe – to supply those needed in the war. The lack of <a href="feathering%20%28horse%29">feathering</a> on the Percheron's lower legs made them easier to care for in the mud that they often worked in during wartime. Their quick trot on paved roads made them more versatile than motorized vehicles, and they were useful for work with guns and in forward units due to their calm temperaments.

Between 1918 and 1922, over 350 Percherons were imported to Britain from France and, combined with stock from the US and Canada, were used as breeding stock to establish the breed in the country. In 1918, the British Percheron Horse Society was formed. British breeders and owners continue to import Percherons from France, and also occasionally from Canada, when not prohibitively expensive.

By the 1930s, Percherons accounted for over 70 percent of the purebred draft horses in the United States, and all of the major <a href="land-grant%20university">land-grant universities</a> maintained stables of Percherons. A 1930 census of horses found over 33,000 Percherons in the United States, with the next most popular breed, the Belgian, having a population of less than 10,000. One Percheron historian attributes this popularity to the breed's "strength, energy, activity, robustness and endurance". After , increasing mechanization prompted a decline in the Percheron population. In 1954, only 85 Percherons were registered in the US, a record low. The 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s were bad years for the US Percheron population, and breeding was reduced to only a few farms. These breeders kept the American population alive through these years, however, and the 1980s saw renewed interest in the breed.
In 1966, the French stud book was changed to include draft types from other areas of France that were closely related to the Percheron – including the horses of <a href="Berrichon%20horse">Berrichon</a>, <a href="Nivernais%20horse">Nivernais</a>, <a href="Marne%20%28department%29">Marne</a>, <a href="Augeron">Augeron</a>, <a href="Bourbonnais">Bourbonnais</a>, <a href="Loire">Loire</a> and <a href="Sa%C3%B4ne-et-Loire">Saône-et-Loire</a>. French Percherons were also hit hard by the advent of mechanization, and between 1970 and 1990 focus was placed on breeding horses of greater mass for the <a href="horse%20meat">meat</a> market. The largest and heaviest stallions were selected for breeding. Beginning at the 1989 World Percheron Congress, French breeders realized that they needed a lighter breed for tourism, export to Japan for draft work, and other markets. In 1993, a trend of importing American stallions to France was started with the <a href="black%20%28horse%29">black</a> stallion Silver Shadows Sheik. This stallion and others were used to create a more elegant, smaller and sleeker look in the French Percheron, while still retaining the traditional bone and foot structure. All the imported stallions were black, reviving the popularity of black Percherons in France. French breeders continue to import American-bred Percheron stallions in order to produce lighter foals, moving away from the heavier meat-type horses of the late 20th century. Also in 1993, the Société Hippique Percheronne anticipated the increasing tourist and exportation markets by prohibiting <a href="docking%20%28animal%29">docking</a>, which was not prohibited for other draft breeds until 1996. This was partly at the request of the Germans, and partly due to the influence of magazines such as <a href="Cheval%20magazine">"Cheval"</a>.

In 1988, there were 1,088 Percherons in the United States, rising to 2,257 by 1998. As of 2009, the Percheron Horse Association of America had horses registered in all 50 states, and had nearly 3,000 members, with around 2,500 new horses being registered annually. The French "Société Hippique Percheronne de France" (Percheron Horse Society of France) registered between 750 and 885 horses in each year between 2007 and 2010. As of 2012, the <a href="American%20Livestock%20Breeds%20Conservancy">American Livestock Breeds Conservancy</a> considers the Percheron to be "recovering", meaning that the breed has exceeded the numbers required to be in one of the "watch" categories, but still needs to be monitored.

The Augeron, also known as Caen or Virois, was developed from the Percheron during the 19th century and was merged back into the Percheron in the 1960s. Bred mainly in the <a href="Pays%20d%27Auge">Pays d'Auge</a> region, it previously had its own studbook, registered by the "Société hippique du trait augeron". The status of the subtype has been repeatedly debated because of its origin from Percherons bred in Pays d'Auge, a breeding group that was modified from the original breed standard due to the influence of soil and climate over the years, creating the Augeron type. Augerons are light gray in color, tall, strong, well-built, and energetic. They stand in height, but those horses bred in <a href="Vire">Vire</a> are known to be smaller than the standard.
In the 19th century, the existence of the Augeron population was, despite its popularity, generally ignored by authors. In Paris, they were named "Caen" and "Virois", after their region of origin, although specialists included the "Caen Virois" breed with the Augeron in a 1904 text. In the 19th century, these horses were sold at fairs in <a href="Argences">Argences</a> and <a href="Bayeux">Bayeux</a> in <a href="Lower%20Normandy">Lower Normandy</a>. They were noticed several times for their homogeneity, beauty, and high value. In 1858, Augerons were sold for between 600 and 1200 <a href="French%20franc">francs</a>.

The "Société hippique du trait augeron", or Augeron Horse Society, was formed in 1913 by breeders in Auge to record these horses in a <a href="breed%20registry">breed registry</a>. One reason for this lay in the desire to protect the cradle of breeding Percheron horses: only animals born near the <a href="Perche">Perche</a> were entitled to registration in the <a href="studbook">studbook</a>, and hence to use the name of "Percheron". This limitation excluded several nearby populations of horses foaled outside of Perche, such as the "Maine" and the Augeron.

The Percheron is the most famous and populous of all French draft breeds in the world today. They were used to improve both the <a href="Ardennes%20horse">Ardennes</a> and <a href="Vladimir%20Heavy%20Draft">Vladimir Heavy Draft</a> horses, and to create the <a href="Spanish-Norman%20horse">Spanish-Norman</a> breed, a cross between the <a href="Andalusian%20horse">Andalusian</a> and the Percheron. By the end of the 19th century, Percherons made up the majority of driving horses in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. The Percheron is still used extensively for draft work and, like other draft breeds, it is also used in France for meat production. Around the world, Percherons are used for parades, <a href="sled">sleigh</a> rides and <a href="hayride">hayride</a>s, as well as being used to pull carriages in large cities. The largest team of working Percherons in Europe is found at <a href="Disneyland%20Paris">Disneyland Paris</a>, where the breed makes up 30 percent of the horses in the park and the horses work to pull trams on the main park street. One of the most famous horse teams in the United States is the <a href="Heinz">Heinz</a> hitch of Percherons, having appeared multiple times at the <a href="Tournament%20of%20Roses%20Parade">Tournament of Roses Parade</a>.

In Great Britain, the Percheron is used for advertising and publicity, as well as forestry and farm work. They are crossbred with lighter horses by breeders of heavy <a href="Field%20hunter">hunters</a> in order to increase size and improve disposition. Purebred Percherons are also ridden, and some have proven useful at <a href="show%20jumping">show jumping</a>. Crossbred Percherons have been used successfully in <a href="dressage">dressage</a>. In both the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a> and northern Australia, Percherons have been crossed with local mares, primarily <a href="Criollo%20horse">Criollos</a> in the Falklands, to produce larger <a href="stock%20horse">stock horse</a>s with greater stamina. These crossbred horses are used extensively in both the sub-Antarctic climate of the Falklands and the sub-tropical climate of Australia for working stock. In Australia they are also crossed with <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>s for use as <a href="mounted%20police">mounted police</a> horses.

In 1978, the first World Percheron Congress was held in Great Britain, and has been held annually ever since. Although the majority of the shows have been held in North America, four – in 1980, 1989, 2001 and 2011 – have been held in France. Each year, in July, the French national breed show is held in <a href="Haras%20du%20Pin">Haras du Pin</a>.

Old Trafford

Old Trafford () is a <a href="association%20football">football</a> stadium in <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28district%29">Old Trafford</a>, Greater Manchester, England, and the home of <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. With a capacity of 74,994, it is the largest club football stadium (and second largest football stadium overall after <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>) in the United Kingdom, and the eleventh-largest in Europe. It is about from <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford Cricket Ground</a> and the adjacent <a href="Old%20Trafford%20tram%20stop">tram stop</a>.

Nicknamed "The Theatre of Dreams" by <a href="Bobby%20Charlton">Bobby Charlton</a>, Old Trafford has been United's home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949 the club shared <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a> with local rivals <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> as a result of <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> bomb damage. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s, and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, almost returning the stadium to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to around 88,000. The stadium's record attendance was recorded in 1939, when 76,962 spectators watched the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-final between <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a>.

Old Trafford has hosted <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-finals, <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> fixtures, matches at the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 World Cup</a> and <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201996">Euro 96</a> and the <a href="2003%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2003 Champions League Final</a>, as well as <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a>'s annual <a href="Super%20League%20Grand%20Final">Super League Grand Final</a> and the final of two <a href="Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup">Rugby League World Cup</a>s. It also hosted football matches at the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>, including women's international football for the first time in its history.

Before 1902, Manchester United were known as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their football matches at <a href="North%20Road%20%28football%20ground%29">North Road</a> and then <a href="Bank%20Street%20%28football%20ground%29">Bank Street</a> in <a href="Clayton%2C%20Manchester">Clayton</a>. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories. Therefore, following the club's rescue from near-bankruptcy and renaming, the new chairman <a href="John%20Henry%20Davies">John Henry Davies</a> decided in 1909 that the Bank Street ground was not fit for a team that had recently won the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> and <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, so he donated funds for the construction of a new stadium. Not one to spend money frivolously, Davies scouted around Manchester for an appropriate site, before settling on a patch of land adjacent to the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a>, just off the north end of the Warwick Road in <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28district%29">Old Trafford</a>.

Designed by Scottish architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a>, who designed several other stadia, the ground was originally designed with a capacity of 100,000 spectators and featured seating in the south stand under cover, while the remaining three stands were left as terraces and uncovered. Including the purchase of the land, the construction of the stadium was originally to have cost £60,000 all told. However, as costs began to rise, to reach the intended capacity would have cost an extra £30,000 over the original estimate and, at the suggestion of club secretary <a href="John%20Bentley%20%28football%20manager%29">J. J. Bentley</a>, the capacity was reduced to approximately 80,000. Nevertheless, at a time when transfer fees were still around the £1,000 mark, the cost of construction only served to reinforce the club's "<a href="Money%20bag%23Nickname">Moneybags</a> United" epithet, with which they had been tarred since Davies had taken over as chairman.

In May 1908, Archibald Leitch wrote to the <a href="Cheshire%20Lines%20Committee">Cheshire Lines Committee</a> (CLC) – who had a rail depot adjacent to the proposed site for the football ground – in an attempt to persuade them to subsidise construction of the grandstand alongside the railway line. The subsidy would have come to the sum of £10,000, to be paid back at the rate of £2,000 "per annum" for five years or half of the gate receipts for the grandstand each year until the loan was repaid. However, despite guarantees for the loan coming from the club itself and two local breweries, both chaired by club chairman John Henry Davies, the Cheshire Lines Committee turned the proposal down. The CLC had planned to build a new station adjacent to the new stadium, with the promise of an anticipated £2,750 "per annum" in fares offsetting the £9,800 cost of building the station. The station – <a href="Trafford%20Park%20railway%20station">Trafford Park</a> – was eventually built, but further down the line than originally planned. The CLC later constructed a modest station with one timber-built platform immediately adjacent to the stadium and this opened on 21 August 1935. It was initially named United Football Ground, but was renamed Old Trafford Football Ground in early 1936. It was served on match days only by a shuttle service of steam trains from <a href="Manchester%20Central%20railway%20station">Manchester Central railway station</a>. It is currently known as <a href="Manchester%20United%20Football%20Ground%20railway%20station">Manchester United Football Ground</a>.

Construction was carried out by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester and development was completed in late 1909. The stadium hosted its inaugural game on 19 February 1910, with United playing host to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. However, the home side were unable to provide their fans with a win to mark the occasion, as Liverpool won 4–3. A journalist at the game reported the stadium as "the most handsomest [sic], the most spacious and the most remarkable arena I have ever seen. As a football ground it is unrivalled in the world, it is an honour to Manchester and the home of a team who can do wonders when they are so disposed".

Before the construction of <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> in 1923, the <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a> was hosted by a number of different grounds around England including Old Trafford. The first of these was the <a href="1911%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1911 FA Cup Final</a> replay between <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a> and <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>, after the original tie at <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20National%20Sports%20Centre">Crystal Palace</a> finished as a no-score draw after <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Association%20football">extra time</a>. Bradford won 1–0, the goal scored by <a href="Jimmy%20Speirs">Jimmy Speirs</a>, in a match watched by 58,000 people. The ground's second FA Cup Final was the <a href="1915%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1915 final</a> between <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. Sheffield United won the match 3–0 in front of nearly 50,000 spectators, most of whom were in the military, leading to the final being nicknamed "the Khaki Cup Final". On 27 December 1920, Old Trafford played host to its largest pre-Second World War attendance for a United league match, as 70,504 spectators watched the Red Devils lose 3–1 to <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. The ground hosted its first international football match later that decade, when <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> lost 1–0 to <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a> in front of 49,429 spectators on 17 April 1926. Unusually, the record attendance at Old Trafford is not for a Manchester United home game. Instead, on 25 March 1939, 76,962 people watched an FA Cup semi-final between <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a>.

In 1936, as part of a £35,000 refurbishment, an 80-yard-long roof was added to the United Road stand (now the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand) for the first time, while roofs were added to the south corners in 1938. Upon the outbreak of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, Old Trafford was requisitioned by the military to be used as a depot. Football continued to be played at the stadium, but a German bombing raid on Trafford Park on 22 December 1940 damaged the stadium to the extent that a Christmas day fixture against <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a> had to be switched to Stockport's ground. Football resumed at Old Trafford on 8 March 1941, but another German raid on 11 March 1941 destroyed much of the stadium, notably the main stand (now the South Stand), forcing the club's operations to move to Cornbrook Cold Storage, owned by United chairman <a href="James%20W.%20Gibson">James W. Gibson</a>. After pressure from Gibson, the <a href="War%20Damage%20Commission">War Damage Commission</a> granted Manchester United £4,800 to remove the debris and £17,478 to rebuild the stands. During the reconstruction of the stadium, Manchester United played their "home" games at <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a>, the home of their cross-town rivals, <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, at a cost of £5,000 a year plus a percentage of the gate receipts. The club was now £15,000 in debt, not helped by the rental of Maine Road, and the Labour MP for Stoke, <a href="Ellis%20Smith">Ellis Smith</a>, petitioned the Government to increase the club's compensation package, but it was in vain. Though Old Trafford was reopened, albeit without cover, in 1949, it meant that a league game had not been played at the stadium for nearly 10 years. United's first game back at Old Trafford was played on 24 August 1949, as 41,748 spectators witnessed a 3–0 victory over <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>.

A roof was restored to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating with the addition of a roof to the <a href="Stretford%20End">Stretford End</a> (now the West Stand) in 1959. The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper <a href="floodlights%20%28sport%29">floodlighting</a>, so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away. The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.

However, although the spectators would now be able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 FIFA World Cup</a> fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely unobstructed view, while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000. The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller), rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first <a href="luxury%20box">private boxes</a> at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973. With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena. Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full effects of a capacity crowd. Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the <a href="1970%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1970 final</a> between Chelsea and <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the <a href="1968%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1968 Intercontinental Cup</a>, which saw <a href="Estudiantes%20de%20La%20Plata">Estudiantes de La Plata</a> win the cup after a 1–1 draw. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain, and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forced the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.

1973 saw the completion of the roof around the circumference of the stadium, along with the addition of 5,500 seats to the Scoreboard End and the replacement of the old manual scoreboard with an electronic one in the north-east corner. Then, in 1975, a £3 million expansion was begun, starting with the addition of the Executive Suite to the Main Stand. The suite's restaurant overlooked the pitch, but the view was still obstructed by the roof pillars. Therefore, in kind with the roofs of the United Road Stand and the Scoreboard End, the Main Stand roof was replaced with a cantilever design. The Executive Suite and cantilever roof were then extended to the full length of the stand, allowing for the relocation of the club offices from the south-east corner to the Main Stand. The south-east quadrant was then removed and replaced in 1985 with a seated section bringing the total <a href="seating%20capacity">seating capacity</a> of the stadium to 25,686 (56,385 overall). The completion of the cantilever roof around three sides of the stadium allowed for the replacement of the old floodlight pylons, and the attachment of a row of floodlights around the inner rim of the roof in 1987.

With every subsequent improvement made to the ground since the Second World War, the capacity steadily declined. By the 1980s, the capacity had dropped from the original 80,000 to approximately 60,000. The capacity dropped still further in 1990, when the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> recommended, and the government demanded that all First and Second Division stadia be converted to <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seaters</a>. This meant that £3–5 million plans to replace the Stretford End with a brand new stand with an all-standing terrace at the front and a cantilever roof to link with the rest of the ground had to be drastically altered. This forced redevelopment, including the removal of the terraces at the front of the other three stands, not only increased the cost to around £10 million, but also reduced the capacity of Old Trafford to an all-time low of around 44,000. In addition, the club was told in 1992 that they would only receive £1.4 million of a possible £2 million from the Football Trust to be put towards work related to the Taylor Report.
The club's resurgence in success and increase in popularity in the early 1990s ensured that further development would have to occur. In 1995, the 30-year-old North Stand was demolished and work quickly began on a new stand, to be ready in time for Old Trafford to host three group games, a quarter-final and a semi-final at <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201996">Euro 96</a>. The club purchased the Trafford Park trading estate, a site on the other site of United Road, for £9.2 million in March 1995. Construction began in June 1995 and was completed by May 1996, with the first two of the three phases of the stand opening during the season. Designed by Atherden Fuller, with Hilstone Laurie as project and construction managers and Campbell Reith Hill as structural engineers, the new three-tiered stand cost a total of £18.65 million to build and had a capacity of about 25,500, raising the capacity of the entire ground to more than 55,000. The cantilever roof would also be the largest in Europe, measuring from the back wall to the front edge. Further success over the next few years guaranteed yet more development. First, a second tier was added to the East Stand. Opened in January 2000, the stadium's capacity was temporarily increased to about 61,000 until the opening of the West Stand's second tier, which added yet another 7,000 seats, bringing the capacity to 68,217. It was now not only the biggest club stadium in England but the biggest in all of the United Kingdom. Old Trafford hosted its first major European final three years later, playing host to the <a href="2003%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2003 UEFA Champions League Final</a> between <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a> and <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>.

From 2001 to 2007, following the demolition of the old Wembley Stadium, the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national football team</a> was forced to play its games elsewhere. During that time, the team toured the country, playing their matches at various grounds from <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a> in Birmingham to <a href="St%20James%27%20Park">St James' Park</a> in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>. From 2003 to 2007, Old Trafford hosted 12 of England's 23 home matches, more than any other stadium. The latest international to be held at Old Trafford was England's 1–0 loss to <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a> on 7 February 2007. The match was played in front of a crowd of 58,207.

Old Trafford's most recent expansion, which took place between July 2005 and May 2006, saw an increase of around 8,000 seats with the addition of second tiers to both the north-west and north-east quadrants of the ground. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> record. The record continued to be pushed upwards before reaching its current peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw United beat <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> 4–1, meaning that just 114 seats (0.15% of the total capacity of 76,212) were left unoccupied. In 2009, a reorganisation of the seating in the stadium resulted in a reduction of the capacity by 255 to 75,957, meaning that the club's home attendance record would stand at least until the next expansion.
Old Trafford celebrated its 100th anniversary on 19 February 2010. In recognition of the occasion, Manchester United's official website ran a feature in which a memorable moment from the stadium's history was highlighted on each of the 100 days leading up to the anniversary. From these 100 moments, the top 10 were chosen by a panel including club statistician Cliff Butler, journalist <a href="David%20Meek">David Meek</a>, and former players <a href="Pat%20Crerand">Pat Crerand</a> and <a href="Wilf%20McGuinness">Wilf McGuinness</a>. At Old Trafford itself, an art competition was run for pupils from three local schools to create their own depictions of the stadium in the past, present and future. Winning paintings were put on permanent display on the concourse of the Old Trafford family stand, and the winners were presented with awards by artist <a href="Harold%20Riley%20%28artist%29">Harold Riley</a> on 22 February. An exhibition about the stadium at the club museum was opened by former goalkeeper <a href="Jack%20Crompton">Jack Crompton</a> and chief executive <a href="David%20Gill%20%28executive%29">David Gill</a> on 19 February. The exhibition highlighted the history of the stadium and features memorabilia from its past, including a programme from the inaugural match and a 1:220 scale model hand-built by model artist Peter Oldfield-Edwards. Finally, at Manchester United's home match against <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> on 14 March, fans at the game received a replica copy of the programme from the first Old Trafford match, and half-time saw relatives of the players who took part in the first game – as well as those of the club chairman <a href="John%20Henry%20Davies">John Henry Davies</a> and stadium architect Archibald Leitch – taking part in the burial of a time capsule of Manchester United memorabilia near the centre tunnel. Only relatives of winger <a href="Billy%20Meredith">Billy Meredith</a>, wing-half <a href="Dick%20Duckworth%20%28footballer%20born%201882%29">Dick Duckworth</a> and club secretary <a href="Ernest%20Mangnall">Ernest Mangnall</a> could not be found.

Old Trafford was used as a venue for several matches in the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics">football</a> competition at the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>. The stadium hosted five group games, a quarter-final and a semi-final in the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20tournament">men's tournament</a>, and one group game and a semi-final in the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">women's tournament</a>, the first women's international matches to be played there. Since 2006, Old Trafford has also been used as the venue for <a href="Soccer%20Aid">Soccer Aid</a>, a biennial charity match initially organised by singer <a href="Robbie%20Williams">Robbie Williams</a> and actor <a href="Jonathan%20Wilkes">Jonathan Wilkes</a>; however, in 2008, the match was played at Wembley Stadium.

The Old Trafford pitch is surrounded by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as the Sir Alex Ferguson (North), East, Sir Bobby Charlton (South) and West Stands. Each stand has at least two tiers, with the exception of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, which only has one tier due to construction restrictions. The lower tier of each stand is split into Lower and Upper sections, the Lower sections having been converted from terracing in the early 1990s.

The Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, formerly known as the United Road stand and the North Stand, runs over the top of United Road. The stand is three tiers tall, and can hold about 26,000 spectators, the most of the four stands. It can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites. It opened in its current state in 1996, having previously been a single-tiered stand. As the ground's main stand, it houses many of the ground's more popular facilities, including the Red Café (a Manchester United theme restaurant/bar) and the Manchester United museum and trophy room. Originally opened in 1986 as the first of its kind in the world, the Manchester United museum was in the south-east corner of the ground until it moved to the redeveloped North Stand in 1998. The museum was opened by <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a> on 11 April 1998, since when numbers of visitors have jumped from 192,000 in 1998 to more than 300,000 visitors in 2009.
The North Stand was renamed as the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand on 5 November 2011, in honour of <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a>'s 25 years as manager of the club. A statue of Ferguson, sculpted by <a href="Philip%20Jackson%20%28sculptor%29">Philip Jackson</a>, was erected outside the stand on 23 November 2012 in recognition of his status as Manchester United's longest-serving manager.

Opposite the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand is the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, formerly Old Trafford's main stand and previously known as the South Stand. Although only a single-tiered stand, the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand contains most of the ground's executive suites, and also plays host to any VIPs who may come to watch the match. Members of the media are seated in the middle of the Upper South Stand to give them the best view of the match. The television gantry is also in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, so the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand is the one that gets shown on television least often. Television studios are located at either end of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, with the club's in-house television station, <a href="MUTV%20%28Manchester%20United%20F.C.%29">MUTV</a>, in the East studio and other television stations, such as the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> and <a href="BSkyB">Sky</a>, in the West studio.

The dugout is in the centre of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, raised above pitch level to give the manager and his coaches an elevated view of the game. Each team's dugout flanks the old players' tunnel, which was used until 1993. The old tunnel is the only remaining part of the original 1910 stadium, having survived the bombing that destroyed much of the stadium during the Second World War. On 6 February 2008, the tunnel was renamed the Munich Tunnel, as a memorial for the 50th anniversary of the 1958 <a href="Munich%20air%20disaster">Munich air disaster</a>. The current tunnel is in the South-West corner of the ground, and doubles as an entrance for the emergency services. In the event that large vehicles require access, the seating above the tunnel can be raised by up to . The tunnel leads up to the players' dressing room, via the television interview area, and the players' lounge. Both the home and away dressing rooms were re-furbished for the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Premier%20League">2018–19</a> season, with the corridor leading to the two widened and separated to keep home and away teams apart.

On 3 April 2016, the South Stand was renamed the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand before kick-off of the Premier League home match against <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>, in honour of Manchester United legend <a href="Bobby%20Charlton">Sir Bobby Charlton</a> who made his Manchester United debut 60 years ago.

Perhaps the best-known stand at Old Trafford is the West Stand, also known as the <a href="Stretford%20End">Stretford End</a>. Traditionally, the stand is where the hard-core United fans are located, and also the ones who make the most noise. Originally designed to hold 20,000 fans, the Stretford End was the last stand to be covered and also the last remaining all-terraced stand at the ground before the forced upgrade to seating in the early 1990s. The reconstruction of the Stretford End, which took place during the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1992–93 season</a>, was carried out by <a href="Alfred%20McAlpine">Alfred McAlpine</a>. When the second tier was added to the Stretford End in 2000, many fans from the old "K Stand" moved there, and decided to hang banners and flags from the barrier at the front of the tier. So ingrained in Manchester United culture is the Stretford End, that <a href="Denis%20Law">Denis Law</a> was given the nickname "King of the Stretford End", and there is now a statue of Law on the concourse of the stand's upper tier.

The East Stand at Old Trafford was the second to be converted to a cantilever roof, following the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand. It is also commonly referred to as the Scoreboard End, as it was the location of the scoreboard. The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000 fans, and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section; an experiment involving the relocation of away fans to the third tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was conducted during the 2011–12 season, but the results of the experiments could not be ascertained in time to make the move permanent for the 2012–13 season. The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter of the alphabet. Although every section had a letter, it is the K Stand that is the most commonly referred to today. The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though many of them have relocated to the second tier of the West Stand.

The East Stand has a tinted glass façade, behind which the club's administrative centre is located. These offices are the home to the staff of Inside United, the official Manchester United magazine, the club's official website, and its other administrative departments. Images and advertisements are often emblazoned on the front of the East Stand, most often advertising products and services provided by the club's sponsors, though a tribute to the <a href="Busby%20Babes">Busby Babes</a> was displayed in February 2008 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster. Above the megastore is a statue of <a href="Matt%20Busby">Sir Matt Busby</a>, who was Manchester United's longest-serving manager until he was surpassed by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2010. There is also a plaque dedicated to the victims of the Munich air disaster on the south end of the East Stand, while the Munich Clock is at the junction of the East and South Stands. On 29 May 2008, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Manchester United's first European Cup title, a statue of the club's "<a href="United%20Trinity">holy trinity</a>" of <a href="George%20Best">George Best</a>, Denis Law and <a href="Bobby%20Charlton">Bobby Charlton</a>, entitled "The United Trinity", was unveiled across <a href="Sir%20Matt%20Busby%20Way">Sir Matt Busby Way</a> from the East Stand, directly opposite the statue of Busby.
The Manchester United club shop has had six different locations since it was first opened. Originally, the shop was a small hut near to the railway line that runs alongside the ground. The shop was then moved along the length of the South Stand, stopping first opposite where away fans enter the ground, and then residing in the building that would later become the club's merchandising office. A surge in the club's popularity in the early 1990s led to another move, this time to the forecourt of the West Stand. With this move came a great expansion and the conversion from a small shop to a "megastore". Alex Ferguson opened the new megastore on 3 December 1994. The most recent moves came in the late 1990s, as the West Stand required room to expand to a second tier, and that meant the demolition of the megastore. The store was moved to a temporary site opposite the East Stand, before taking up a permanent residence in the ground floor of the expanded East Stand in 2000. The floor space of the megastore was owned by United's kit sponsors, <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>, who operated the store until the expiry of their sponsorship deal at the end of July 2015, when ownership reverted to the club.

The pitch at the ground measures approximately long by wide, with a few metres of run-off space on each side. The centre of the pitch is about nine inches higher than the edges, allowing surface water to run off more easily. As at many modern grounds, under the pitch is an underground heating system, composed of of plastic pipes. Former club manager <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a> often requested that the pitch be relaid, most notably half-way through the 1998–99 season, when the team won <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">the Treble</a>, at a cost of about £250,000 each time. The grass at Old Trafford is watered regularly, though less on wet days, and mowed three times a week between April and November, and once a week from November to March.
In the mid-1980s, when Manchester United Football Club owned the <a href="Manchester%20Giants">Manchester Giants</a>, Manchester's basketball franchise, there were plans to build a 9,000-seater indoor arena on the site of what is now Car Park E1. However, the chairman at the time, <a href="Martin%20Edwards">Martin Edwards</a>, did not have the funds to take on such a project, and the basketball franchise was eventually sold. In August 2009, the car park became home to the <a href="Hublot">Hublot</a> clock tower, a -tall tower in the shape of the Hublot logo, which houses four -diameter clock faces, the largest ever made by the company.

The east side of the stadium is also the site of <a href="Hotel%20Football">Hotel Football</a>, a football-themed hotel and fan clubhouse conceived by former Manchester United captain <a href="Gary%20Neville">Gary Neville</a>. The building is located on the east side of Sir Matt Busby Way and on the opposite side of the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a> from the stadium, and can accommodate up to 1,500 supporters. It opened in the summer of 2015. The venture is conducted separately from the club and was funded in part by proceeds from Neville's testimonial match.

In 2009, it was reported that United continued to harbour plans to increase the capacity of the stadium further, with the next stage pointing to a redevelopment of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, which, unlike the rest of the stadium, remains single tier. A replication of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand development and North-East and North-West Quadrants would see the stadium's capacity rise to an estimated 95,000, which would give it a greater capacity than <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> (90,000). Any such development is likely to cost around £100 million, due to the proximity of the railway line that runs adjacent to the stadium, and the corresponding need to build over it and thus purchase up to 50 houses on the other side of the railway. Nevertheless, the Manchester United group property manager confirmed that expansion plans are in the pipeline – linked to profits made from the club's property holdings around Manchester – saying "There is a strategic plan for the stadium ... It is not our intention to stand still". One criticism of the plans, however, is that increasing the height of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand would further reduce the amount of light coming onto the pitch, which has caused problems in similarly large stadia – such as <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</a> and the <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a>; according to <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a>, the developments on the other stands have already caused problems. It was also suggested that, should such an expansion take place, Old Trafford could be used instead of Wembley for big matches such as <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> internationals – in order to increase the ability of fans in the north of the country to watch England play; and <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-finals – to maintain the prestige of the national stadium for the final.

In March 2016 (ten years after the previous redevelopment), talk of the redevelopment of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand re-emerged. The stadium's provision for disabled fans is below standards required by regulations. Increasing capacity for disabled supporters is estimated to reduce overall capacity by 2,300. Five different solutions have been considered for the summer of 2017. One option is to increase the capacity up to 80,000 by adding a second tier to the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, bringing it to a similar height to the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand opposite but without a third level. Replication of the corner stands on the other side of the stadium would further increase the stadium's capacity to 88,000 and increase the number of executive facilities. Housing on Railway Road and the railway line itself have previously impeded improvements to this stand but the demolition of housing and engineering advances mean that the additional tier could now be built at reduced cost. 

Old Trafford has also been used for purposes other than football. Before the Old Trafford football stadium was built, the site was used for games of <a href="shinty">shinty</a>, the traditional game of the Scottish Highlands. During the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, the stadium was used by American soldiers for games of baseball. On 17 September 1981, the North Section of <a href="cricket">cricket</a>'s <a href="Lambert%20%26amp%3B%20Butler%20Floodlit%20Competition">Lambert & Butler Floodlit Competition</a> was played there; in the semi-finals, <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> defeated <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a> and <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> beat <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, before Lancashire beat Nottinghamshire by 8 runs in the final to reach the national final, played between the other regional winners at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a> the next day.

Old Trafford has played host to both codes of <a href="rugby%20football">rugby football</a>, although <a href="rugby%20league">league</a> is played there with greater regularity than <a href="rugby%20union">union</a>. The <a href="Super%20League">Super League</a> grand final has been played at Old Trafford every year since the introduction of the playoff system in 1998, and is set to continue to do so until 2020; the first rugby league match to be played at Old Trafford was held during the <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20Northern%20Rugby%20Football%20League%20season">1924–25 season</a>, when a Lancashire representative side hosted the <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20league%20team">New Zealand national team</a>, with Manchester United receiving 20 per cent of the gate receipts. The first league match to be held at Old Trafford came in November 1958, with <a href="Salford%20Red%20Devils">Salford</a> playing against <a href="Leeds%20Rhinos">Leeds</a> under floodlights in front of 8,000 spectators.

The first rugby league Test match played at Old Trafford came in 1986, when <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20league%20team">Australia</a> beat <a href="Great%20Britain%20national%20rugby%20league%20team">Great Britain</a> 38–16 in front of 50,583 spectators in the first test of the <a href="1986%20Kangaroo%20tour%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20France">1986 Kangaroo tour</a>. The <a href="1989%20World%20Club%20Challenge">1989 World Club Challenge</a> was played at Old Trafford on 4 October 1989, with 30,768 spectators watching <a href="Widnes%20Vikings">Widnes</a> beat the <a href="Canberra%20Raiders">Canberra Raiders</a> 30–18. Old Trafford also hosted the second Great Britain vs Australia <a href="The%20Ashes%20%28rugby%20league%29">Ashes tests</a> on both the <a href="1990%20Kangaroo%20tour%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20France">1990</a> and <a href="1994%20Kangaroo%20tour%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20France">1994</a> <a href="Kangaroo%20Tour">Kangaroo Tour</a>s. The stadium also hosted the semi-final between <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20league%20team">England</a> and <a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20league%20team">Wales</a> at the <a href="1995%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup">1995 Rugby League World Cup</a>; England won 25–10 in front of 30,042 fans. The final rugby league international played at Old Trafford in the 1990s saw Great Britain record their only win over Australia at the ground in 1997 in the second test of the <a href="Super%20League%20Test%20series">Super League Test series</a> in front of 40,324 fans.

When the <a href="Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup">Rugby League World Cup</a> was hosted by Great Britain, Ireland and France in <a href="2000%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup">2000</a>, Old Trafford was chosen as the venue for the final; the match was contested by Australia and New Zealand, and resulted in a 40–12 win for Australia, watched by 44,329 spectators. Old Trafford was also chosen to host the <a href="2013%20Rugby%20League%20World%20Cup%20Final">2013 Rugby League World Cup Final</a>. The game, played on 30 November, was won by <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20league%20team">Australia</a> 34–2 over defending champions <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20league%20team">New Zealand</a>, and attracted a crowd of 74,468, a world record for a rugby league international. During the game, Australia winger <a href="Brett%20Morris">Brett Morris</a> suffered a heavy crash into the advertising boards at the Stretford End, emphasising questions raised pre-match over the safety of Old Trafford as a rugby league venue, in particular the short in-goal areas and the slope around the perimeter.

Old Trafford hosted its first rugby union international in 1997, when <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand</a> defeated <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a> 25–8. A second match was played at Old Trafford on 6 June 2009, when England beat <a href="Argentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Argentina</a> 37–15. The stadium was one of 12 confirmed venues set to host matches of the <a href="2015%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2015 Rugby World Cup</a>; however, in April 2013 United pulled out of the contract over concerns about pitch quality and not wanting to compromise their relationship with the 13-man code. In October 1993, a <a href="World%20Boxing%20Council">WBC</a>–<a href="World%20Boxing%20Organization">WBO</a> Super-Middleweight unification fight was held at the ground, with around 42,000 people paying to watch WBO champion <a href="Chris%20Eubank">Chris Eubank</a> fight WBC champion <a href="Nigel%20Benn">Nigel Benn</a>.

Aside from sporting uses, several concerts have been played at Old Trafford, with such big names as <a href="Bon%20Jovi">Bon Jovi</a>, <a href="Genesis%20%28band%29">Genesis</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href="Status%20Quo%20%28band%29">Status Quo</a>, <a href="Rod%20Stewart">Rod Stewart</a> and <a href="Simply%20Red">Simply Red</a> playing. An edition of "<a href="Songs%20of%20Praise">Songs of Praise</a>" was recorded there in September 1994. Old Trafford is also regularly used for private functions, particularly weddings, Christmas parties and business conferences. The first wedding at the ground was held in the Premier Suite in February 1996.

The highest attendance recorded at Old Trafford was 76,962 for an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-final between <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a> on 25 March 1939. However, this was before the ground was converted to an all-seater stadium, allowing many more people to fit into the stadium. Old Trafford's record attendance as an all-seater stadium currently stands at 76,098, set at a <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> game between Manchester United and <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> on 31 March 2007. This is also the Premier League's record attendance. Old Trafford's record attendance for a non-competitive game is 74,731, set on 5 August 2011 for a pre-season testimonial between Manchester United and <a href="New%20York%20Cosmos%20%282010%29">New York Cosmos</a>. The lowest recorded attendance at a competitive game at Old Trafford in the post-War era was 11,968, as United beat <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> 3–0 on 29 April 1950. However, on 7 May 1921, the ground hosted a <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> match between <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a> and <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> for which the official attendance was just 13. This figure is slightly misleading as the ground also contained many of the 10,000 spectators who had stayed behind after watching the match between Manchester United and <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> earlier that day.

The highest average attendance at Old Trafford over a league season was 75,826, set in the 2006–07 season. The greatest total attendance at Old Trafford came two seasons later, as 2,197,429 people watched Manchester United win the Premier League for the third year in a row, the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>, and reach the final of the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> and the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The lowest average attendance at Old Trafford came in the 1930–31 season, when an average of 11,685 spectators watched each game.

Adjacent to the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand of the stadium is <a href="Manchester%20United%20Football%20Ground%20railway%20station">Manchester United Football Ground railway station</a>. The station is between the <a href="Deansgate%20railway%20station">Deansgate</a> and <a href="Trafford%20Park%20railway%20station">Trafford Park</a> stations on the Southern Route of Northern Rail's <a href="Liverpool%20to%20Manchester%20Lines">Liverpool to Manchester line</a>, and is only open on matchdays. The ground is also serviced by both the Altrincham, Eccles and East Didsbury lines of the <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Manchester Metrolink</a> network, with the nearest stops being <a href="Exchange%20Quay%20tram%20stop">Exchange Quay</a> at nearby <a href="Salford%20Quays">Salford Quays</a>, and <a href="Old%20Trafford%20tram%20stop">Old Trafford</a>, which it shares with the <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford Cricket Ground</a>. Both stops are a five-minute walk from the football ground. The <a href="Wharfside%20tram%20stop">Wharfside tram stop</a>, currently under construction on Trafford Wharf Road, which is within close proximity of the stadium, will link the proposed <a href="Trafford%20Park%20Line">Trafford Park Line</a> to the existing station, on the Eccles–Piccadilly Line.

Buses 255 and 256, which are run by <a href="Stagecoach%20Manchester">Stagecoach Manchester</a> and 263, which is run by <a href="Arriva%20North%20West">Arriva North West</a> run from <a href="Manchester%20Piccadilly%20Gardens%20bus%20station">Piccadilly Gardens</a> in Manchester to Chester Road, stopping near Sir Matt Busby Way, while Stagecoach's 250 service stop outside Old Trafford on Wharfside Way and X50 service stops across from Old Trafford on Water's Reach. There are also additional match buses on the 255 service, which run between Old Trafford and Manchester city centre. Other services that serve Old Trafford are Arriva's 79 service (Stretford – Swinton), which stops on Chester Road and 245 (Altrincham – Exchange Quay), which stops on Trafford Wharf Road, plus <a href="First%20Greater%20Manchester">First Greater Manchester</a> service 53 (Cheetham – Pendleton) and Stagecoach's 84 service (Withington Hospital – Manchester), which stop at nearby <a href="Trafford%20Bar%20tram%20stop">Trafford Bar tram stop</a>. The ground also has several car parks, all within walking distance of the stadium; these are free to park in on non-matchdays.

Germany women's national football team

The Germany women's national football team () is governed by the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">German Football Association</a> (DFB).

The German national team is one of the most successful in women's football. They are two-time <a href="FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">world champions</a>, having won the <a href="2003%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2003</a> and <a href="2007%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2007</a> tournaments. They are also the only nation to have won both the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">men's</a> and women's tournament. The team has won eight of the twelve <a href="UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship">UEFA European Championships</a>, claiming six consecutive titles between 1995 and 2013. Germany is one of the two nations to win both the <a href="UEFA%20Euro">men's</a> and women's European tournament, along with the Netherlands. Germany has won Olympic gold in <a href="Football%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">2016</a>, after three consecutive bronze medals at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">Women's Olympic Football Tournament</a>, finishing third in <a href="Football%20at%20the%202000%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">2000</a>, <a href="Football%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">2004</a> and <a href="Football%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">2008</a>. <a href="Birgit%20Prinz">Birgit Prinz</a> holds the record for most appearances and is the team's all-time leading goalscorer. Prinz has also set international records; she has received the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">FIFA World Player of the Year</a> award three times and is the joint second <a href="FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup%23Overall%20top%20goalscorers">overall top goalscorer</a> at the Women's World Cup.

Women's football was long met with skepticism in Germany, and official matches were banned by the DFB until 1970. However, the women's national team has grown in popularity since winning the World Cup in 2003, as it was chosen as <a href="German%20Sportspersonality%20of%20the%20year">Germany's Sports Team of the Year</a>. As of June 2018, Germany is ranked 2nd in the <a href="FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Rankings">FIFA Women's World Rankings</a>.

In 1955, the <a href="German%20Football%20Association">DFB</a> decided to forbid women's football in all its clubs in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>. In its explanation, the DFB cited that "this combative sport is fundamentally foreign to the nature of women" and that "body and soul would inevitably suffer damage". Further, the "display of the body violates etiquette and decency". In spite of this ban, more than 150 unofficial international matches were played in the 1950s and 1960s. On 30 October 1970, the ban on women's football was lifted at the DFB annual convention.

Other football associations had already formed official women's national teams in the 1970s, the DFB long remained uninvolved in women's football. In 1981, DFB official <a href="Horst%20R.%20Schmidt">Horst R. Schmidt</a> was invited to send a team to the <a href="Women%27s%20World%20Invitational%20Tournament">unofficial women's football world championship</a>. Schmidt accepted the invitation but hid the fact that West Germany had no women's national team at the time. To avoid humiliation, the DFB sent the German club champions <a href="Bergisch%20Gladbach%2009">Bergisch Gladbach 09</a>, who went on to win the tournament. Seeing a need, the DFB established the women's national team in 1982. DFB president Hermann Neuberger appointed <a href="Gero%20Bisanz">Gero Bisanz</a>, an instructor at the <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> Sports College, to set up the team.

In September 1982, Bisanz organised two scouting training courses from which he selected a squad of 16 players. The team's first international match took place on 10 November 1982 in <a href="Koblenz">Koblenz</a>. Following the tradition of the men's team, <a href="Switzerland%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Switzerland</a> was chosen as West Germany's first opponent. Doris Kresimon scored the first international goal in the 25th minute. In the second half, 18-year-old <a href="Silvia%20Neid">Silvia Neid</a> contributed two goals to the 5–1 victory; Neid later became the assistant coach in 1996 and the head coach in 2005.

With five draws and one defeat, West Germany failed to qualify for the inaugural <a href="1984%20European%20Competition%20for%20Women%27s%20Football">1984 European Championship</a>, finishing third in the qualifying group. In the beginning, Bisanz's primary objective was to close the gap to the <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n countries and <a href="Italy%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> – then the strongest teams in Europe. He emphasized training in basic skills and the need for an effective youth programme. Starting in 1985, Bisanz increasingly called-up younger players, but at first had little success with this concept, as West Germany again failed to qualify for the <a href="1987%20European%20Competition%20for%20Women%27s%20Football">1987 European Championship</a> finals.

Undefeated and without conceding a goal, the German team qualified for the <a href="1989%20European%20Competition%20for%20Women%27s%20Football">European Championship</a> for the first time in 1989; the tournament was played on home soil in West Germany. The semi-final against Italy was the first international women's football match shown live on German television. The game was decided by a <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shootout</a>, in which goalkeeper Marion Isbert saved three penalty kicks and scored the winning penalty herself. On 2 July 1989 in <a href="Osnabr%C3%BCck">Osnabrück</a>, West Germany played <a href="Norway%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Norway</a> in the final. Before a crowd of 22,000, they beat favourites Norway and won 4–1 with goals from Ursula Lohn, <a href="Heidi%20Mohr">Heidi Mohr</a> and Angelika Fehrmann. This victory marked the team's first international title.

After the <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>, the <a href="East%20German">East German</a> football association joined the DFB. The East German women's national football team had played only one official international match, losing 0–3 to Czechoslovakia in a friendly match on 9 May 1990. The unified German team defended their title successfully at the <a href="1991%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship">1991 European Championship</a>. After winning all games in the qualifying group, Germany again met Italy in the semi-final, this time winning 3–0. On 14 July 1991, the German team once more faced Norway in the final. The game went to extra time, during which Heidi Mohr and Silvia Neid scored for Germany and secured the 3–1 victory.

In November 1991, Germany participated in the first <a href="1991%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">Women's World Cup</a> in China. Following victories over <a href="Nigeria%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Nigeria</a>, <a href="Chinese%20Taipei%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Taiwan</a> and Italy, the German team reached the quarter-final without conceding a single goal. Silvia Neid scored the first German World Cup goal on 17 November 1991 against Nigeria. Germany won the quarter-final against Denmark 2–1 after extra time, but lost 2–5 in the semi-final to the <a href="United%20States%20women%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">United States</a>, who went on to win the tournament. Following a 0–4 defeat in the third-place match against <a href="Sweden%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Sweden</a>, Germany finished fourth in the tournament.

The German team failed to defend their title at the <a href="1993%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship">1993 European Championship</a>, suffering a semi-final defeat to Italy in a penalty shootout, and later losing 1–3 against Denmark in the third-place playoff. Despite the disappointing result, new talents such as <a href="Steffi%20Jones">Steffi Jones</a>, <a href="Maren%20Meinert">Maren Meinert</a> and <a href="Silke%20Rottenberg">Silke Rottenberg</a> made their tournament debut and later became key players for the German team.

<a href="Birgit%20Prinz">Birgit Prinz</a> scored in a major tournament for the first time in 1995.
In 1995, Germany won its third <a href="1995%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship">European Championship</a>. After winning all qualification matches, scoring 55 goals, the German team defeated <a href="England%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">England</a> 6–2 over two legs in the semi-final. Germany met Sweden in the final, which was played at the <a href="Fritz%20Walter%20Stadion">Fritz Walter Stadion</a> in <a href="Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a>, Germany, on 26 March 1995. The Swedish team managed to score early, but Germany came back to win 3–2 with goals from Maren Meinert, <a href="Birgit%20Prinz">Birgit Prinz</a> and <a href="Bettina%20Wiegmann">Bettina Wiegmann</a>.

At the <a href="1995%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">1995 Women's World Cup</a> in Sweden, the German team lost against the Scandinavian hosts, but still succeeded in winning their group by beating <a href="Japan%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Japan</a> and <a href="Brazil%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a>. Germany won the quarter-final against England 3–0, and defeated <a href="China%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">China</a> 1–0 with a late goal by Bettina Wiegmann in the semi-final. On 18 June 1995 in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, the German team appeared in their first Women's World Cup final. Facing Norway, they lost the match 0–2, but as runners-up achieved their best World Cup result until then.

Women's football was first played as an Olympic sport at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament%20matches">1996 Summer Olympics</a>. Bettina Wiegmann scored the first Olympic goal in the opening match against Japan, which Germany won 3–2. After losing their second group game against Norway 2–3, and drawing with Brazil 1–1, Germany was eliminated, finishing third in the group with four points from three matches. Head coach Gero Bisanz resigned after the tournament and his assistant since 1983, <a href="Tina%20Theune">Tina Theune</a>, took over as the new national coach. Silvia Neid ended her playing career and was appointed the new assistant coach.

The <a href="1997%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship">1997 European Championship</a> was the first test for new coach Theune. Following a defeat against Norway, Germany finished second in the qualifying group and only secured qualification by beating <a href="Iceland%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Iceland</a> in a relegation play-off. After drawing with Italy and Norway, a victory over Denmark in the last group game saw the German team go through to the knockout stage. They beat Sweden 1–0 in the semi-final, and on 12 July 1997, claimed their fourth European championship with a 2–0 win over Italy, with goals from <a href="Sandra%20Minnert">Sandra Minnert</a> and Birgit Prinz.

At the <a href="1999%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">1999 Women's World Cup</a> in the United States, the German team also failed to qualify directly, but managed to beat the <a href="Ukraine%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Ukraine</a> in a qualifying play-off. Germany started their World Cup campaign by drawing with Italy and winning 6–0 over <a href="Mexico%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Mexico</a>. In the last group game, Germany drew 3–3 against Brazil; by conceding a last minute equalizer, Germany failed to win the group and subsequently had to face the hosts in the quarter-final. With 54,642 people in attendance, among them U.S. President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, the crowd at the <a href="Jack%20Kent%20Cooke%20Stadium">Jack Kent Cooke Stadium</a> was the biggest the German team had ever played in front of. Despite leading twice, they lost 2–3 to the eventual World Cup winners.

Germany competed at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a>, winning all three group games against <a href="Australia%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Australia</a>, Brazil and Sweden. The German team dominated the semi-final against Norway, but lost the game 0–1 after an <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a> by <a href="Tina%20Wunderlich">Tina Wunderlich</a> in the 80th minute. They beat Brazil 2–0 in the third place match with goals from Birgit Prinz and <a href="Renate%20Lingor">Renate Lingor</a>, and won the bronze medal. It was the first Olympic medal for the German Football Associations since 1988 when the men's team also won bronze.

In 2001, Germany hosted the <a href="2001%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship">European Championship</a>. Following victories over Sweden, <a href="Russia%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Russia</a> and England in the group stage, the German team beat Norway 1–0 in the semi-final courtesy of a diving header by <a href="Sandra%20Smisek">Sandra Smisek</a>. On 7 July 2001 in <a href="Ulm">Ulm</a>, they met Sweden in the final, which was played in heavy rain. The game was scoreless after 90 minutes and went to extra time, where <a href="Claudia%20M%C3%BCller">Claudia Müller</a> scored a <a href="golden%20goal">golden goal</a> and secured the fifth European title for Germany.

At the <a href="2003%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2003 Women's World Cup</a> in the United States, Germany was drawn in a group with <a href="Canada%20women%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">Canada</a>, Japan and <a href="Argentina%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a>. After winning all three group games, the German team defeated Russia 7–1 in the quarter-final, which set up another clash with the United States. Germany's <a href="Kerstin%20Garefrekes">Kerstin Garefrekes</a> scored after 15 minutes and goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg made several key saves. In the dying minutes of the semi-final, Maren Meinert and Birgit Prinz sealed the 3–0 win. On 12 October 2003, Germany met Sweden in the World Cup final in Los Angeles. The Scandinavians went ahead before half time, but Maren Meinert equalized shortly after the break. The game went to extra time, where <a href="Nia%20K%C3%BCnzer">Nia Künzer</a> headed the winning golden goal in the 98th minute to claim Germany's first Women's World Cup title. Birgit Prinz was honoured as the tournament's best player and top goalscorer.

With wins over China and Mexico, the German team finished first in their group at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">2004 Summer Olympics</a>. They beat Nigeria 2–1 in the quarter-final, but suffered a 1–2 semi-final loss to the United States after extra time. In the third place match, Germany defeated Sweden 1–0 with a goal by Renate Lingor, winning the teams's second Olympic bronze medal.

The <a href="UEFA%20Women%27s%20Euro%202005">2005 European Championship</a> was held in England. With wins over Norway, Italy and <a href="France%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">France</a> in Round 1, the German team advanced to the semi-final, where they defeated <a href="Finland%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Finland</a> 4–1. On 19 June 2005, they met Norway for the third time in the European championship final. Germany won 3–1 with goals from <a href="Inka%20Grings">Inka Grings</a>, Renate Lingor and Birgit Prinz and added a sixth European title. Head coach Tina Theune stepped down after the tournament and her assistant Silvia Neid took over as national coach. In 2006, Germany won the annual <a href="Algarve%20Cup">Algarve Cup</a> for the first time.

As reigning world champion, Germany played the opening game at the <a href="2007%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2007 Women's World Cup</a> in China, outclassing Argentina 11–0. After a goalless draw against England and a 2–0 win over Japan, the German team defeated <a href="North%20Korea%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">North Korea</a> 3–0 in the quarter-final. They beat Norway by the same result in the semi-final, with goals from <a href="Kerstin%20Stegemann">Kerstin Stegemann</a>, <a href="Martina%20M%C3%BCller%20%28footballer%29">Martina Müller</a> and a Norwegian own goal. On 30 September 2007, Germany faced Brazil in the World Cup final in <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. Birgit Prinz put Germany in front after half time and goalkeeper <a href="Nadine%20Angerer">Nadine Angerer</a> saved a penalty by Brazilian <a href="Marta%20Vieira%20da%20Silva">Marta</a>. <a href="Simone%20Laudehr">Simone Laudehr</a> scored a second goal after 86 minutes, which sealed the German 2–0 victory. Germany was the first team (men's and women's game) to win the World Cup without conceding a goal and the first to successfully defend the Women's World Cup title. With 14 goals, Prinz became the tournament's <a href="FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup%23Overall%20top%20goalscorers">overall top goalscorer</a>.

In a replay of the 2007 World Cup final, the German team drew 0–0 with Brazil in the opening game at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">2008 Summer Olympics</a>. They then beat both Nigeria and North Korea to advance to the quarter-final, where they defeated Sweden 2–0 after extra time. In the semi-final, Germany again met Brazil. Birgit Prinz scored in the 10th minute, but the German team lost 1–4 after conceding three goals to Brazilian counter-attacks in the second half. They beat Japan 2–0 for the bronze medal, with <a href="Fatmire%20Bajramaj">Fatmire Bajramaj</a> scoring both goals. The third consecutive semi-final loss at the Olympics was seen as a disappointment by both the players and the German press. The team's overall performance and head coach Silvia Neid were harshly criticised in the media.

Germany qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Women%27s%20Euro%202009">2009 European Championship</a> in Finland winning all eight games and scoring 34 goals. They beat Norway, France and Iceland in the group stage to advance to the quarter-final, where they won 2–1 against Italy. After trailing Norway at half-time in the semi-final, the German team fought back to a 3–1 victory. On 10 September 2009, they defeated England 6–2 for their seventh European trophy. Birgit Prinz and Inka Grings scored twice, with <a href="Melanie%20Behringer">Melanie Behringer</a> and <a href="Kim%20Kulig">Kim Kulig</a> also scoring. Grings retained her award as the tournament's top scorer from 2005, while Germany extended their winning streak at the European Championship finals to a 19-match run dating back to 1997.

Germany hosted the <a href="2011%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2011 FIFA Women's World Cup</a> and won the three games on the group stage, over Canada, France and Nigeria. On the quarterfinals, the team suffered an upset by Japan, who won on overtime with a goal by <a href="Karina%20Maruyama">Karina Maruyama</a>. The defeat broke the Germans' streak of sixteen undefeated games at the World Cup. By failing to finish among the top two UEFA teams, Germany was unable to qualify for the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">2012 Summer Olympics</a>.

At the <a href="UEFA%20Women%27s%20Euro%202013">2013 European Championship</a> in Sweden, the Germans won their sixth straight continental title, with the decisive game being a 1–0 victory over Norway. Goalkeeper Nadine Angerer, who stopped two penalties during the final, was chosen as the tournament's best player. The <a href="2015%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2015 FIFA Women's World Cup</a> had Germany again reaching the top four. In the semifinal against the United States, <a href="C%C3%A9lia%20%C5%A0a%C5%A1i%C4%87">Célia Šašić</a>, who wound up as the tournament's top scorer, missed a penalty, and afterwards goals by <a href="Carli%20Lloyd">Carli Lloyd</a> and <a href="Kelley%20O%27Hara">Kelley O'Hara</a> lead to an American victory. The third place match saw the Germans lose their first ever match to England after 21 contests, due to a penalty kick by <a href="Fara%20Williams">Fara Williams</a> during extra time.

Germany is one of the most successful nations at the <a href="FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">FIFA Women's World Cup</a>, having won the tournament twice and finishing runner-up once. The German team won the World Cup in 2003 and 2007. At the first World Cup in 1991, they finished in fourth place. In 1995, Germany reached the World Cup final, but were defeated by <a href="Norway%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Norway</a>. The team's worst results were quarter-final losses to the <a href="United%20States%20women%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">United States</a> in 1999, and <a href="Japan%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Japan</a> in 2011. Overall, the German team has appeared in three Women's World Cup finals, and is a five-time semi-finalist. They have participated in every Women's World Cup and have a 26–5–8 win–draw–loss record.

Women's football debuted at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament%20matches">1996 Summer Olympics</a> and <a href="Bettina%20Wiegmann">Bettina Wiegmann</a> scored the first Olympic goal in the opening game of the tournament. However, Germany failed to progress to the knockout stage and was eliminated after Round 1. Four years later the German team won the bronze medal at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a>. They again finished third at both the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">2004</a> and the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">2008 Summer Olympics</a>.

The German team has qualified for all <a href="Football%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">Women's Olympic Football Tournament</a>s until 2008. However, they failed to qualify for the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">2012 tournament</a> as UEFA used the 2011 World Cup for qualification, and Germany ended below <a href="France%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">France</a> and <a href="Sweden%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Sweden</a>. The German team beat Sweden in the Olympics final in Rio in 2016 to obtain their first Olympic gold medal.

Germany failed to qualify for the first two <a href="UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship">UEFA European Championships</a> in 1984 and 1987. Since 1989, the German team has participated in every tournament and is the record European champion with eight titles. Germany has won six consecutive championships from 1995 to 2013 and has an overall 31–6–3 win–draw–loss record. The worst German result at the European championship finals was finishing fifth in 2017.

Former German international <a href="Horst%20Hrubesch">Horst Hrubesch</a> is the current head coach of the German women's national football team. The coach's official title is "DFB-Trainer" and he or she is employed by the German Football Association.


The German national football team has no <a href="national%20stadium">national stadium</a>. Like the men, the women's team play their home matches in different stadiums throughout the country. As of June 2011, they have played in 87 different German cities. Most home games have been held in <a href="Osnabr%C3%BCck">Osnabrück</a> with six matches, followed by <a href="Ulm">Ulm</a> (five games), and <a href="Bochum">Bochum</a>, <a href="Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a>, <a href="Koblenz">Koblenz</a>, <a href="L%C3%BCdenscheid">Lüdenscheid</a>, <a href="Rheine">Rheine</a>, <a href="Siegen">Siegen</a> and <a href="Weil%20am%20Rhein">Weil am Rhein</a> (three games each). The first home match in former <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a> was played in <a href="Aue">Aue</a> in May 1991.

In the 1980s and 1990s, home matches were mostly played in smaller towns with no professional football clubs. As the team became more successful, especially after the World Cup win in 2003, the number of spectators rose accordingly. Today, the team usually plays in stadiums with 10,000 to 25,000 seats. The ten largest German cities have only hosted five international matches. The team have played twice in <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> and Berlin, and once <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a>, <a href="Dortmund">Dortmund</a>, <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, <a href="Essen">Essen</a>, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="Munich">Munich</a> and <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> have never hosted an international match of the women's team.

Outside Germany, they have played the most games in <a href="Faro%2C%20Portugal">Faro, Portugal</a> (10 matches), and <a href="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, China (six matches), the host cities of the annual <a href="Algarve%20Cup">Algarve Cup</a> and the <a href="Four%20Nations%20Tournament%20%28women%27s%20football%29">Four Nations Tournament</a> respectively. They have also played five games in <a href="Albufeira">Albufeira</a>, Portugal (also an Algarve Cup venue), and four times in <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> in the United States.

The record attendance for Germany was 73,680 in the <a href="2011%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2011 Women's World Cup</a> opening game against <a href="Canada%20women%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">Canada</a> at the <a href="Olympic%20Stadium">Olympic Stadium</a> in Berlin. That game also set a new European record in women's football. Away from home, the team's crowd record was 54,642 in the <a href="1999%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">1999 Women's World Cup</a> quarter-final against the <a href="United%20States%20women%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">United States</a> at the <a href="Jack%20Kent%20Cooke%20Stadium">Jack Kent Cooke Stadium</a> in <a href="Landover%2C%20Maryland">Landover</a>.

The German women's national football team wears white shirts with black shorts and white socks, following the tradition of the <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">German men's team</a> – black and white are the <a href="Flag%20of%20Prussia">colours of Prussia</a>. The current change kit is red and black, with black shorts and red socks. In the past, Germany also used green shirts with white shorts and green socks as the away kit.

The women's national team originally played with the emblem of the German men's team, a variation of the DFB logo with the Federal Eagle of Germany ("Bundesadler") and three <a href="Star%20%28football%20badge%29">stars at the top</a> for the men's <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954</a>, <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974</a> and <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1990</a> <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> titles. Since their first <a href="FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">Women's World Cup</a> win in 2003, the team displays its own World Cup titles; initially with one star, and since 2007, with two stars at the top of the emblem. While being reigning world champions, Germany also displayed the newly created "FIFA Women's World Champions Badge" on their shirts from 2009 until 2011 when they were succeeded by Japan.

In accordance with the rules of the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a>, Germany does not wear its official uniform with the logo of the German Football Association while competing at the Summer Olympics. Instead, the DFB badge is replaced by the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Germany">coat of arms of Germany</a>. Like all DFB squads, the women's national team is supplied by <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>, which had provided a specifically designed female football jersey since 1999. The team's main sponsor is the German insurance company <a href="Allianz">Allianz</a>.

For most of the 20th century, women's football was a niche sport in Germany and was frowned upon. When the DFB appointed <a href="Gero%20Bisanz">Gero Bisanz</a> to coach the newly founded women's national team, he was initially very reluctant about his assignment and feared it would harm his reputation. Winning the <a href="1989%20UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship">1989 European Championship</a> was the team's first international success, but it had little lasting effect on their popularity. As a gift for the first European trophy, every player received a <a href="tea%20set">tea set</a>, which is often cited as an example of male chauvinism and general lack of interest in the women's national team at that time. This attitude within the German Football Association has changed considerably in the last two decades, in particular during the term of <a href="Theo%20Zwanziger">Theo Zwanziger</a> as DFB president, an outspoken supporter of women's football.
Each member of the <a href="2003%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2003 Women's World Cup</a> squad received a prearranged bonus of 15,000 <a href="euro">euro</a>s for winning the tournament; four years later the players received 50,000 euros for their successful title defense. In 2009, one million of the 6.7 million DFB members were female.

The 2003 World Cup title marked the breakthrough for the women's national football team in Germany. The final was watched by 10.48 million viewers on German television (a 33.2 percent market share) and the German team was welcomed home by almost 10,000 fans at <a href="R%C3%B6mer">Frankfurt's city hall</a>. Later that year, they were honoured as the 2003 <a href="German%20Sportspersonality%20of%20the%20year">German Sports Team of the Year</a>. <a href="Nia%20K%C3%BCnzer">Nia Künzer</a>'s World Cup winning <a href="golden%20goal">golden goal</a> was voted Germany's 2003 <a href="Goal%20of%20the%20Year%20%28Germany%29">Goal of the Year</a>, the first time the award was won by a female player. Since 2005, almost all of the women's national football team's matches have been shown live on German television.

The final of the <a href="2007%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2007 Women's World Cup</a> was seen by 9.05 million television viewers (a 50.5 percent market share). After the team returned to Germany, they were celebrated by a crowd of 20,000 in Frankfurt. In December 2007, all players of the World Cup squad received the <a href="Silberne%20Lorbeerblatt">Silberne Lorbeerblatt</a> (Silver Laurel Leaf), the highest <a href="state%20decoration">state decoration</a> for athletes in Germany. National coach <a href="Silvia%20Neid">Silvia Neid</a> was awarded the <a href="Bundesverdienstkreuz">Federal Cross of Merit on ribbon</a> by German president <a href="Horst%20K%C3%B6hler">Horst Köhler</a>.

In 2009, the team's six home matches had an average attendance of 22,753. In a survey of German football fans, 65 percent of the male and 62 percent of the female respondents said they were interested in women's football. However, this popularity is mostly limited to international matches. Although the number of spectators in the <a href="Frauen-Bundesliga">women's Bundesliga</a> has more than doubled since 2003, the average attendance in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Frauen-Bundesliga">2007–08 season</a> (887) was still less than three percent of that of the <a href="Bundesliga">men's Bundesliga</a> (38,612).

Today, women's football is socially accepted in Germany, although one of the main points of criticism remains the alleged lack of quality compared to the men's game. The German women's national team has played several exhibition matches against male teams, most notably losing 0–3 to the <a href="VfB%20Stuttgart">VfB Stuttgart</a> Under-17 squad in preparation for the 2003 World Cup. Most German players dismiss comparisons between the quality of men's and women's football; <a href="Renate%20Lingor">Renate Lingor</a> has said they are "two entirely different sports". Players such as <a href="Simone%20Laudehr">Simone Laudehr</a>, <a href="Ariane%20Hingst">Ariane Hingst</a> and <a href="Melanie%20Behringer">Melanie Behringer</a> have stated that men's football is played at a much faster pace, but also has more interruptions and brutal tackling than the women's game. <a href="Linda%20Bresonik">Linda Bresonik</a> has said she generally prefers to watch men's football.

The following players were named to the squad for the <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly</a> match against <a href="France%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">France</a> on 28 February 2019.

Head coach: <a href="Martina%20Voss-Tecklenburg">Martina Voss-Tecklenburg</a>

The following players were named to a squad in the last 12 months.

Notes:

<a href="Birgit%20Prinz">Birgit Prinz</a>, a former <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">team captain</a> who retired after the 2011 World Cup, holds the record for Germany and European appearances, having played 214 times from 1994 to 2011. She is one of 21 German players to have reached 100 <a href="cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a>. <a href="Kerstin%20Stegemann">Kerstin Stegemann</a> is second, having played 191 times. <a href="Bettina%20Wiegmann">Bettina Wiegmann</a>, Germany's team captain during the <a href="2003%20FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">2003 World Cup</a> win, comes fourth with 154 games. Prinz exceeded Wiegmann's record as the most capped player in November 2006. Wiegmann is the only honorary captain of the German women's national football team.

The title of Germany's highest goalscorer is also held by Prinz. She scored her first goal in July 1994 against <a href="Canada%20women%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">Canada</a> and finished her career with 128 goals (averaging 0.60 goals per game). <a href="Heidi%20Mohr">Heidi Mohr</a>, as well as being the second-highest scorer, is also the most prolific with 83 goals coming from 104 games (averaging 0.80 goals per game). Two players share the record for goals scored in one match: <a href="Conny%20Pohlers">Conny Pohlers</a> scored five goals in October 2001 against <a href="Portugal%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Portugal</a>, and <a href="Inka%20Grings">Inka Grings</a> scored five times in February 2004, again facing Portugal. <a href="Silvia%20Neid">Silvia Neid</a>, the former German national coach, is the sixth highest goalscorer with 48 goals in 111 games.

The largest margin of victory achieved by Germany is 17–0 against Kazakhstan during a <a href="UEFA%20Women%27s%20Championship">European Championship</a> qualifying game in November 2011. The record defeat, a 0–6 deficit against the <a href="United%20States%20women%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">United States</a>, occurred during a friendly match in March 1996.

Former goalkeeper <a href="Nadine%20Angerer">Nadine Angerer</a> has the most appearances for a goalkeeper, with 145 games as goal keeper (89 without conceding a goal) and one game as a substitute as defender. 
<a href="Silke%20Rottenberg">Silke Rottenberg</a> is second with 126 caps and 68 games without conceding a goal.Bettina Wiegmann holds the record of 14 goals from penalty kicks; <a href="Renate%20Lingor">Renate Lingor</a> comes in second with 8 goals. <a href="Tina%20Wunderlich">Tina Wunderlich</a> scored the team's only <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a> in the semi-final of the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a> against <a href="Norway%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Norway</a>; it was the game's only goal.

The German team also holds several international records. In 2007, they were the first to win two consecutive <a href="FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">Women's World Cup</a> titles and they achieved the biggest win in tournament history by beating <a href="Argentina%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a> 11–0. Germany is also the only team to win either the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">men's</a> or women's World Cup without conceding a goal and the only country to win both World Cups. With 14 goals, Prinz became the <a href="FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup%23Top%20scorers%20of%20all%20time">overall top goalscorer</a> at the Women's World Cup in 2007, and she and Brazilian <a href="Marta%20%28footballer%29">Marta</a> are the only women to have received the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">FIFA World Player of the Year</a> award at least three times.

Myst IV: Revelation

Myst IV: Revelation is an <a href="Adventure%20game">adventure</a> video game, the fourth installment in the "<a href="Myst%20%28series%29">Myst</a>" series, developed and published by <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>. "Revelation" was the first game in the series to be initially released on a <a href="DVD-ROM">DVD-ROM</a> format at launch; a multiple <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> version was not produced as it would have taken twelve compact discs to fit the data. Riven had been released as a DVD-ROM, but only after its first 5-cd version. Exile was later ported to DVD-ROM for the 10th Anniversary collection. Like "", "Revelation" combines pre-rendered graphics with digital video, but also features real-time 3D effects for added realism.

The plot of "Revelation" follows up on plot details from the original "Myst". The player is summoned by <a href="Atrus">Atrus</a>, a man who creates links to other worlds known as Ages by writing special linking tablets. Almost twenty years earlier, Atrus' two sons nearly destroyed all of his linking books and were imprisoned; Atrus now wishes to see if his sons' imprisonment has reformed them. The player ends up traveling to each brother's prison, in an attempt to recover Atrus' daughter <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Yeesha">Yeesha</a> from the brothers' plot.

Development of "Revelation" lasted more than three years; Ubisoft had up to 80 employees working on the game. Musician <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> lent his voice and a song to the game's audio; the original score was written by "Exile"s composer <a href="Jack%20Wall%20%28composer%29">Jack Wall</a>. Overall, reception to the game was positive; reviewers lauded the impressive visuals, sound, and puzzles. Publications such as "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" took issue with the control scheme of the game. "Revelation" is the last game in the "Myst" series to use both prerendered backgrounds and full-motion video; the final game in the series, "", is rendered in real-time throughout.

"Myst IV: Revelation" is an adventure game in which the player experiences gameplay from the eyes of <a href="Stranger%20%28Myst%29">an unnamed protagonist</a> referred to as the Stranger. Players explore interactive worlds known as Ages by using the mouse or keyboard, solving puzzles and uncovering the game's narrative. Players cannot move freely across each Age; instead, as in the previous games in the "Myst" series, they travel by clicking set locations called "nodes", where players can rotate their view in any direction. "Revelation" also features a "Zip" mode, which allows a method of rapidly crossing explored areas by skipping intermediate nodes; areas that can be instantly traveled to are stored as thumbnail representations for rapid movement across Ages.

The mouse cursor helps to provide visual cues for player actions and movement. The cursor appears as a hand that changes depending on what the player is hovering the cursor over. For example, to move in a direction, the cursor changes to point in the intended direction. If players can view an item in greater detail, the cursor changes to a hand holding a <a href="magnifying%20glass">magnifying glass</a>. By clicking and dragging the cursor, the player performs actions such as pushing, pulling, and tapping items.

"Revelation" features several gameplay enhancements that aid puzzle solving and plot progression. Early in the game, players receive a camera, which can be used to take screenshots or pictures of clues. Players can use an on-screen journal to jot down notes instead of having to write down clues as with previous "Myst" games. Much of the game's story is revealed via flashbacks triggered by an amulet that has the power to relay memories attached to objects. Zip mode, the amulet, the camera, and the journal are available via a menu on the bottom of the game screen.

In 1825 <a href="Atrus">Atrus</a> calls the <a href="Stranger%20%28Myst%29">Stranger</a> to his home in Tomahna to request his friend's assistance. Atrus is the writer of special books, which serve as links to worlds known as Ages. Twenty years earlier, his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar, destroyed his library on Myst and trapped their parents in order to plunder the wealth of Atrus' Ages. The Stranger's intervention saved Atrus, who had imprisoned his sons via traps intended for thieves. Atrus' wife Catherine hopes that, after twenty years, they have finally repented for their crimes. Atrus is not as sure his sons have reformed, and so wishes the Stranger to act as an impartial judge. After being knocked unconscious by an explosion, the Stranger realizes that <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Yeesha">Yeesha</a>, Atrus' daughter, has disappeared.

The Stranger sets out to find Yeesha, traveling to the prison Ages of Spire and Haven. On Spire, Sirrus has used his scientific knowledge to craft explosives, allowing him to breach the chamber that contained the linking book back to Tomahna, and has escaped; journeying to Haven reveals that Sirrus has also freed Achenar. The Stranger journeys to the Age of Serenia and encounters Achenar, holding a "Life Stone"; Achenar tells the Stranger that Sirrus is mad and has captured Yeesha, reveals that he kept a journal from twenty years earlier hidden on the island, and warns the Stranger not to let Atrus come after them. Achenar's journal reveals that he and Sirrus planned to trap their mother Catherine on Riven and use a "Memory Chamber", a gigantic flower-like structure used to preserve the memories of the dead, to take control of Atrus' body and steal his knowledge of the Art of Writing. The Life Stone that Achenar stole is used to power the Memory Chambers, leaving the current one in danger of collapse. Shortly afterwards, the Stranger finds Sirrus in an underwater harvester used for collecting memory globes for storing those memories; he blows up the harvester and flees to an older Memory Chamber, decrepit and abandoned. After encountering the Stranger there, Sirrus tells the Stranger that Achenar is the guilty one, and asks the Stranger to find Atrus and bring him to Serenia to set things right.

Finding that the old Memory Chamber door has been locked by Sirrus with a special color-code combination, the Stranger goes to the active Memory Chamber to seek aid from the Serenian Protectors, who believe that the answers can be found in their "mirror realm", known simply as Dream. Obtaining a "spirit guide", the Stranger enters Dream and interacts with their guide, who tells them to interact with the Ancestors, the spirits of all Serenians who have died and had their memories preserved, to bring them into harmony. After bringing the Ancestors into harmony, the Stranger discovers the combination to Sirrus' color-code lock. Returning to the "waking world" and entering the old Memory Chamber, the Stranger finds Yeesha strapped into a chair, and she begs to be released from it with a silver lever. At that moment, Achenar arrives with a crossbow and the Life Stone, and warns that Sirrus used the Memory Chamber to remove Yeesha's memories and transfer his own into her body; Achenar points to an amber lever, which will reverse the mind-transfer.

At this point, as in the other games, the ending <a href="alternate%20ending">varies</a>. Delaying too long will result in Yeesha (who is in fact Sirrus) taking Achenar's crossbow and shooting first him, then the Stranger. The silver lever will release Yeesha (again, possessed by Sirrus), who drops a large stone on Achenar and the Stranger, and then shoots the Stranger dead. In the good ending, the Stranger pulls the amber lever, reversing the mind-transfer process. But because of the age of the Memory Chamber, it becomes unstable; Achenar tells the Stranger to return to Dream and set Yeesha's memories right, while he uses the Life Stone to stabilize the chamber by inserting it into the chamber's shrine, poisoning him with its contained toxic spores. In Dream, the Stranger finds a monstrous creature, representing Sirrus' Dream-form, anchored to Yeesha's essence and preventing her from returning to her body; with no spirit guide, Sirrus is forced to cling to Yeesha to avoid being lost forever. He maintains his anchors by jumbling up Yeesha's memories. The Stranger restores Yeesha's memories and frees her from Sirrus' grasp; Sirrus' Dream-form is destroyed by the shifting waves of Dream, killing him. The Stranger awakens to find Achenar, fatally poisoned, confirming that the transfer was successful; he dies shortly afterward. The Stranger then returns to Tomahna to meet with Atrus, who says that Catherine has taken Yeesha to Tay (the "rebel Age" used to evacuate Catherine's people in "<a href="Riven">Riven</a>"), and remarks that while his sons are gone, his daughter is safe.

When <a href="Mattel">Mattel Interactive</a> still owned the rights to the "Myst" series, development of "Myst IV" was contracted out to <a href="DreamForge%20Intertainment">DreamForge Intertainment</a>, developers of the game "<a href="Sanitarium%20%28video%20game%29">Sanitarium</a>"; Dreamforge was hired before <a href="Presto%20Studios">Presto Studios</a> to develop "". Dreamforge's "Myst" used real-time graphics, and was two years into development and twenty percent complete when <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>, who had by this point acquired the rights to the series, canceled the project and decided to restart development from scratch internally.

According to Geneviève Lord, "Revelation"s producer, concluding the story of the two brothers had originally been intended as the plot for "Myst III". Due to a limited amount of time to develop the game and to not interfere with Dreamforge's "Myst" game, whose plot details were still forming, the plot was dropped. The story was then redeveloped when Ubisoft began work on "Myst IV". Cyan, "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" and "<a href="Riven">Riven</a>"s developer, set down "a certain number of rules" that Ubisoft had to follow, according to Lord, but otherwise the team was free to develop new ideas, keeping in the spirit of "Myst" lore.

Ubisoft's development of "Revelation" took over three years and more than eighty employees. Early on, the development team made the decision to use <a href="pre-rendered">pre-rendered</a> graphics for the game, to match the style of previous "Myst" games. This proved to be a challenge, as the studio had never developed a pre-rendered game before, and had to hire over fifty new employees who had experience in the field. Full production was started on the game before artistic direction and engine development tools were fully established, and the resulting lack of focus and communication meant that a bad working relationship existed between the game designers, programmers, and modelers for most of the production.

As an improvement over the prerendered technology present in "Myst", "Riven", and "Exile", "Revelation" uses its "ALIVE" engine to animate nearly everything in the game. The water animations, for example, are fully rendered for each location. The trees sway in the breeze, and the sky has moving clouds. Wildlife includes creatures that walk through the environment and occasionally interact with the player. The game also features a number of effects applied in real time, such as <a href="lens%20flare">lens flare</a>s, dynamic lighting, and an optional focal blur. In a trend started by the original "Myst", the game uses live actors to play the game's roles in <a href="live%20action">live-action</a> video sequences. There are more than 70 minutes of video, and the game allows players to look around and interact with the video while it is playing.

<a href="Jack%20Wall%20%28composer%29">Jack Wall</a> composed, conducted, and produced the music for "Revelation"; the game was his second game score, following the music for "". Wall was initially a sound engineer and producer, and stated composing "was kind of like a next step for me, rather than something I decided to do early on". The success and recognition of "Exile"s score landed Wall the job of writing "Revelation"s music with a budget of $100,000—twice the amount he had worked with for "Exile".

Wall reused, reorchestrated and expanded themes composed by previous "Myst" composer <a href="Robyn%20Miller">Robyn Miller</a>; for example, Wall reused Atrus' Theme from "Riven" and the brothers' <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s from the original game. Wall credited the "Myst" universe and story with allowing him to write music "Western ears are somewhat less accustomed to"; "Revelation"s score was inspired by Eastern European music that Wall enjoyed in the 1990s.

In addition to Jack Wall's score, the game features a song by <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> entitled "Curtains", originally a B-side from Gabriel's single "<a href="Big%20Time%20%28Peter%20Gabriel%20song%29">Big Time</a>". Gabriel also performed a voiceover for the game.
Overall, "Revelation" was received positively by critics; the game garnered 82/100 and 82% averages on aggregate sites <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> and <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>, respectively; the Xbox version of the game received less favorable scores than the computer version. Its computer version debuted in sixth place on the <a href="The%20NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>'s sales chart for the October 3–9 period, before dropping to tenth in its second week. The game claimed positions 92 and 12 for the months of September and October, respectively, and sold between 100,000 and 400,000 copies in the United States by August 2006. By that date, combined sales of all "Myst" games released in the 2000s had reached 1.6 million units in the country.

As with previous "Myst" games, the visuals and interactivity of "Revelation" were singled out as the strongest features. Reviewers praised the use of subtle animations to bring the scenery to life; <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s <a href="Greg%20Kasavin">Greg Kasavin</a> stated that the additions "truly helps make each scene in the game seem like more than just a panoramic picture, and instead it feels like a real place". Jack Wall's score and the sound design were consistently praised. The addition of the in-game camera and notes system was also positively received. "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" proclaimed that although it would have been easy for the developers to lose heart after the disappointing "", Ubisoft had instead produced "one of the most polished games" the reviewer, Paul Presley, had ever come across.

Certain reviewers criticized aspects of the gameplay that had not been fixed or altered from previous "Myst" titles. "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>", for example, complained about having to hunt for the small hotspots that allowed actions to occur. A reviewer for "<a href="The%20Houston%20Chronicle">The Houston Chronicle</a>" judged the method of traveling from node to node as tiresome to navigate. Another complaint was that the slow cursor animations made searching for actions occasionally tedious. Many publications noted the rather steep computer requirements; in addition to requiring a DVD-ROM drive, the game took up more than 7 <a href="gigabyte">gigabyte</a>s when fully installed. <a href="Charles%20Herold">Charles Herold</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", the only mainstream critic with a negative view of "Revelation's" music, dismissed the score as "tediously literal".

"Revelation" would be the last "Myst" game that used prerendered graphics or full motion video. <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a>, the original developer of both "Myst" and "Riven", used real-time rendered graphics for the next installment in the series, "". "Myst V" was announced as the final game in the series.

"Revelation" won GameSpot's and <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s 2004 "Best Adventure Game" awards. It was nominated for "Computer Gaming World"s prize in this category, and as IGN's pick for the best computer adventure game of 2004, but these awards went respectively to "<a href="In%20Memoriam%20%28video%20game%29">In Memoriam</a>" and "<a href="Sid%20Meier%27s%20Pirates%21%20%282004%20video%20game%29">Sid Meier's Pirates!</a>" Similarly, "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" nominated "Myst IV" for its "Best Original Music" award, but gave it to "<a href="World%20of%20Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>". GameSpot's editors called "Revelation" "a highly traditional adventure game that embodies nearly all the virtues of this classic genre." In 2011, <a href="Adventure%20Gamers">Adventure Gamers</a> named "Myst IV" the 40th-best adventure game ever released.

Falaise Pocket

The Falaise Pocket or Battle of the Falaise Pocket (; 12 – 21 August 1944) was the decisive engagement of the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Battle of Normandy</a> in the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. A <a href="pocket%20%28military%29">pocket</a> was formed around <a href="Falaise%2C%20Calvados">Falaise, Calvados</a>, in which the German <a href="Army%20Group%20B">Army Group B</a>, with the <a href="7th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">7th Army</a> and the <a href="5th%20Panzer%20Army%20%28Germany%29">Fifth Panzer Army</a> (formerly ) were encircled by the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Western Allies</a>. The battle is also referred to as the Battle of the Falaise Gap (after the corridor which the Germans sought to maintain to allow their escape), the Chambois Pocket, the Falaise-Chambois Pocket, the Argentan–Falaise Pocket or the Trun–Chambois Gap. The battle resulted in the destruction of most of Army Group B west of the <a href="Seine">Seine</a>, which opened the way to Paris and the <a href="France%E2%80%93Germany%20border">Franco-German border</a> for the Allied armies on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Western Front</a>.

Six weeks after <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-Day</a>, the Allied <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a> on 6 June 1944, the <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German Army</a> was in turmoil. While the <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Expeditionary%20Force">Allied Army</a> experienced great difficulty in breaking through the German lines (the city of <a href="Caen">Caen</a> was supposed to have been captured on the first day of the invasion and was not <a href="Battle%20of%20Caen">taken until late in July</a>) the German Army's defence of this area of Normandy was expending irreplaceable resources. The <a href="Allied%20Expeditionary%20Air%20Force">Allied air forces</a> controlled the skies (up to 100 km behind enemy lines), bombing and strafing <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> troops, reinforcements, and necessary army supplies, such as fuel and ammunition. On the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a>, the Soviet Union's <a href="Operation%20Bagration">Operation Bagration</a> and the <a href="Lvov%E2%80%93Sandomierz%20Offensive">Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive</a> were in the midst of destroying the <a href="German%20Army%20Group%20Centre">German Army Group Centre</a>. In France, the German Army had used its available reserves (especially its armour reserves) to buttress the front lines around Caen, and there were few additional troops available to create successive lines of defence. To make matters worse, the <a href="20%20July%20plot">20 July plot</a>—in which officers of the German Army, including some stationed in France, tried to assassinate <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and seize power—had failed, and in its aftermath there was very little trust between Hitler and his generals.

In order to break out of Normandy, the Allied armies developed a multi-stage operation. It started with a <a href="Second%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British</a> and <a href="First%20Canadian%20Army">Canadian</a> attack along the eastern battle line around Caen in <a href="Operation%20Goodwood">Operation Goodwood</a> on 18 July. The German Army responded by sending a large portion of its <a href="5th%20Panzer%20Army">armoured reserves</a> to defend. Then, on 25 July thousands of American bombers <a href="carpet%20bombing">carpet bombed</a> a 6,000-metre hole on the western end of the German lines around <a href="Saint-L%C3%B4">Saint-Lô</a> in <a href="Operation%20Cobra">Operation Cobra</a>, allowing the Americans to push forces through this gap in the German lines. After some initial resistance, the German forces were overwhelmed and the Americans broke through. On 1 August, Lieutenant General <a href="George%20S.%20Patton">George S. Patton</a> was named the commanding officer of the newly recommissioned <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Central">US Third Army</a>—which included large segments of the soldiers that had broken through the German lines—and with few German reserves behind the front line, the race was on. The Third Army quickly pushed south and then east, meeting very little German resistance. Concurrently, the British and Canadian troops pushed south (<a href="Operation%20Bluecoat">Operation Bluecoat</a>) in an attempt to keep the German armour engaged. Under the weight of this British and Canadian attack, the Germans withdrew; the orderly withdrawal eventually collapsed due to lack of fuel.

Despite lacking the resources to defeat the US breakthrough and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives south of <a href="Caumont-l%27%C3%89vent%C3%A9">Caumont</a> and Caen, Field Marshal <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20von%20Kluge">Günther von Kluge</a>, the commander of Army Group B, was not permitted by Hitler to withdraw but was ordered to conduct a counter-offensive at <a href="Mortain">Mortain</a> against the US breakthrough. Four depleted <a href="panzer%20division">panzer division</a>s were not enough to defeat the <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army">First US Army</a>. The disastrous <a href="Operation%20L%C3%BCttich">Operation Lüttich</a> drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.

On 8 August, the Allied ground forces commander, General <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a>, ordered the Allied armies to converge on the Falaise–Chambois area to envelop Army Group B, with the First US Army forming the southern arm, the British the base, and the Canadians the northern arm of the encirclement. The Germans began to withdraw on 17 August, and on 19 August the Allies linked up in Chambois. Gaps were forced in the Allied lines by German counter-attacks, the biggest being a corridor forced past the <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28Poland%29">1st Polish Armoured Division</a> on Hill 262, a commanding position at the mouth of the pocket. By the evening of 21 August, the pocket had been sealed, with trapped inside. Many Germans escaped, but losses in men and equipment were huge. A few days later, the Allied <a href="Liberation%20of%20Paris">Liberation of Paris</a> was completed, and on 30 August the remnants of Army Group B retreated across the Seine, which ended <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>.

Early Allied objectives in the wake of the D-Day invasion of <a href="Nazi%20occupation%20of%20France">German-occupied France</a> included the <a href="deep%20water%20port">deep water port</a> of <a href="Cherbourg-Octeville">Cherbourg</a> and the area surrounding the town of <a href="Caen">Caen</a>. Allied attacks to expand the bridgehead had rapidly defeated the initial German attempts to destroy the invasion force, but bad weather in the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> delayed the Allied build-up of supplies and reinforcements, while enabling the Germans to move troops and supplies with less interference from the Allied air forces. Cherbourg was not captured by the <a href="VII%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">VII US Corps</a> until 27 June, and the German defence of Caen lasted until 20 July, when the southern districts were taken by the British and Canadians in <a href="Operation%20Goodwood">Operation Goodwood</a> and <a href="Operation%20Atlantic">Operation Atlantic</a>.

General <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a>, the Allied ground forces commander, had planned a strategy of attracting German forces to the east end of the bridgehead against the British and Canadians, while the <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army">US First Army</a> advanced down the west side of the <a href="Cotentin%20Peninsula">Cotentin Peninsula</a> to <a href="Avranches">Avranches</a>. On 25 July the US First Army commander, Lieutenant-General <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>, began <a href="Operation%20Cobra">Operation Cobra</a>. The US First Army broke through the German defences near <a href="Saint-L%C3%B4">Saint-Lô</a> and by the end of the third day had advanced south of its start line at several points. Avranches was captured on 30 July and within 24 hours the <a href="VIII%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">US VIII Corps</a> of the US Third Army crossed the bridge at <a href="Pontaubault">Pontaubault</a> into Brittany and continued south and west through open country, almost without opposition.

The US advance was swift and by 8 August, <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a>, the former headquarters of the German <a href="7th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">7th Army</a>, had been captured. After Operation Cobra, <a href="Operation%20Bluecoat">Operation Bluecoat</a> and <a href="Operation%20Spring">Operation Spring</a>, the German army in Normandy was so reduced that "only a few <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> fanatics still entertained hopes of avoiding defeat". On the Eastern Front, Operation Bagration had begun against <a href="Army%20Group%20Centre">Army Group Centre</a> which left no possibility of reinforcement of the Western Front. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> sent a directive to Field Marshal <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20von%20Kluge">Günther von Kluge</a>, the replacement commander of <a href="Army%20Group%20B">Army Group B</a> after the sacking of <a href="Gerd%20von%20Rundstedt">Gerd von Rundstedt</a>, ordering "an immediate counter-attack between Mortain and Avranches" to "annihilate" the enemy and make contact with the west coast of the Cotentin peninsula.

Eight of the nine <a href="Panzer%20division">Panzer division</a>s in Normandy were to be used in the attack, but only four could be made ready in time. The German commanders protested that their forces were incapable of an offensive, but the warnings were ignored and <a href="Operation%20L%C3%BCttich">Operation Lüttich</a> commenced on 7 August around Mortain. The first attacks were made by the <a href="2nd%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">2nd Panzer Division</a>, <a href="SS%20Division%20Leibstandarte">SS Division Leibstandarte</a> and the <a href="SS%20Division%20Das%20Reich">SS Division Das Reich</a>, but they had only 75 <a href="Panzer%20IV">Panzer IV</a>s, 70 <a href="Panther%20tank">Panthers</a> and 32 <a href="self-propelled%20gun">self-propelled gun</a>s. The Allies were forewarned by <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> signals intercepts, and although the offensive continued until 13 August, the threat of Operation Lüttich had been ended within 24 hours. Operation Lüttich had led to the most powerful remaining German units being defeated at the west side of the Cotentin Peninsula by the US First Army, and the Normandy front on the verge of collapse. Bradley said

The First Canadian Army was ordered to capture high ground north of Falaise to trap Army Group B. The Canadians planned <a href="Operation%20Totalize">Operation Totalize</a>, with attacks by strategic bombers and a novel night attack using <a href="Kangaroo%20%28armoured%20personnel%20carrier%29">Kangaroo</a> armoured personnel carriers. Operation Totalize began on the night of 7/8 August; the leading infantry rode on the Kangaroos, guided by electronic aids and illuminants, against the , which held a front, supported by the <a href="101%20SS%20Heavy%20Panzer%20Battalion">101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion</a> and remnants of the <a href="89th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">89th Infantry Division</a>. <a href="Battle%20of%20Verri%C3%A8res%20Ridge">Verrières Ridge</a> and <a href="Cintheaux">Cintheaux</a> were captured on 9 August, but the speed of the advance was slowed by German resistance and some poor Canadian unit leadership, which led to many casualties in the <a href="4th%20Canadian%20%28Armoured%29%20Division">4th Canadian Armoured Division</a> and <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28Poland%29">1st Polish Armoured Division</a>. By 10 August, Anglo-Canadian forces had reached Hill 195, north of Falaise. The following day, Canadian commander <a href="Guy%20Simonds">Guy Simonds</a> relieved the armoured divisions with infantry divisions, ending the offensive.

Still expecting Kluge to withdraw his forces from the tightening Allied noose, Montgomery had for some time been planning a "long envelopment", by which the British and Canadians would pivot left from Falaise toward the River Seine while the US Third Army blocked the escape route between the Seine and the <a href="Loire">Loire</a>, trapping all surviving German forces in western France. In a telephone conversation on 8 August, the <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Allied Commander</a>, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, recommended an American proposal for a shorter envelopment at <a href="Argentan">Argentan</a>. Montgomery and Patton had misgivings; if the Allies did not take Argentan, <a href="Alen%C3%A7on">Alençon</a> and Falaise quickly, many Germans might escape. Believing he could always fall back on the original plan if necessary, Montgomery accepted the wishes of Bradley as the man on the spot, and the proposal was adopted.

The Third Army advance from the south made good progress on 12 August; Alençon was captured and Kluge was forced to commit troops he had been gathering for a counter-attack. The next day, the <a href="5th%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">US 5th Armored Division</a> of the <a href="XV%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">US XV Corps</a> advanced and reached positions overlooking Argentan. On 13 August, Bradley over-ruled orders by Patton for a further push northwards towards Falaise by the 5th Armored Division. Bradley instead ordered the XV Corps to "concentrate for operations in another direction". The US troops near Argentan were ordered to withdraw, which ended the pincer movement by the XV Corps. Patton objected but complied, which left an exit for the German forces in the Falaise Pocket.

With the Americans on the southern flank halted and then engaged with <a href="Panzer%20Group%20Eberbach">Panzer Group Eberbach</a>, and with the British pressing in from the north-west, the First Canadian Army, which included the <a href="Polish%201st%20Armoured%20Division">Polish 1st Armoured Division</a>, was ordered to close the trap. After a limited attack by the <a href="2nd%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Division">2nd Canadian Infantry Division</a> down the <a href="Laize-la-Ville">Laize</a> valley on 12–13 August, most of the time since Totalize had been spent preparing for <a href="Operation%20Tractable">Operation Tractable</a>, a set-piece attack on Falaise. The operation commenced on 14 August at 11:42, covered by an artillery <a href="smoke%20screen">smokescreen</a> that mimicked the night attack of Operation Totalize. The 4th Canadian Armoured Division and the 1st Polish Armoured Division crossed the Laison, but delays at the River <a href="Dives%20%28river%29">Dives</a> gave time for the Tiger tanks of the to counter-attack.

Navigating through the smoke slowed progress, and the mistaken use by the First Canadian Army of yellow smoke to identify their positions—the same colour strategic bombers used to mark targets—led to some bombing of the Canadians and slower progress than planned. On 15 August, the <a href="2nd%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Division">2nd</a> and <a href="3rd%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Division">3rd Canadian Infantry Division</a>s and the <a href="2nd%20Canadian%20%28Armoured%29%20Brigade">2nd Canadian (Armoured) Brigade</a> continued the offensive, but progress remained slow. The 4th Armoured Division captured <a href="Soulangy">Soulangy</a> against determined German resistance and several German counter-attacks, which prevented a breakthrough to <a href="Trun%2C%20Orne">Trun</a>. The next day, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division entered Falaise against minor opposition from "<a href="Waffen%20SS">Waffen SS</a>" units and scattered pockets of German infantry, and by 17 August had secured the town.

At midday on 16 August, Kluge had refused an order from Hitler for another counter-attack, and in the afternoon Hitler agreed to a withdrawal but became suspicious that Kluge intended to surrender to the Allies. Late on 17 August, Hitler sacked Kluge and recalled him to Germany; Kluge then either killed himself or was executed by SS-officer <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Stroop">Jürgen Stroop</a> for his involvement in the <a href="20%20July%20plot">20 July plot</a>. Kluge was succeeded by Field Marshal <a href="Walter%20Model">Walter Model</a>, whose first act was to order the immediate retreat of the 7th Army and Fifth Panzer Army, while the "<a href="II%20SS%20Panzer%20Corps">II SS Panzer Corps</a>"—with the remnants of four Panzer divisions—held the north face of the escape route against the British and Canadians, and the "<a href="XLVII%20Panzer%20Corps%20%28Germany%29">XLVII Panzer Corps</a>"—with what was left of two Panzer divisions—held the southern face against the Third US Army.

By 17 August the encirclement was incomplete. The 1st Polish Armoured Division, part of the First Canadian Army, was divided into three battlegroups and ordered to make a wide sweep to the south-east to meet American troops at Chambois. Trun fell to the 4th Canadian Armoured Division on 18 August. Having captured <a href="Champeaux%2C%20Manche">Champeaux</a> on 19 August, the Polish battlegroups converged on Chambois, and with reinforcements from the 4th Canadian Armoured Division, the Poles secured the town and linked up with the US 90th and French <a href="2nd%20Armored%20Division%20%28France%29">2nd Armoured</a> divisions by evening. The Allies were not yet astride the 7th Army escape route in any great strength, and their positions were attacked by German troops inside the pocket. An armoured column of the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in <a href="Saint-Lambert%2C%20Calvados">St. Lambert</a>, took half the village and kept a road open for six hours until nightfall. Many Germans escaped, and small parties made their way through to the Dives during the night.

Having taken Chambois, two of the Polish battlegroups drove north-east and established themselves on part of <a href="Hill%20262">Hill 262</a> (Mont Ormel ridge), spending the night of 19 August digging in. The following morning, Model ordered elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division and <a href="9th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Hohenstaufen">9th SS Panzer Division</a> to attack from outside the pocket towards the Polish positions. Around midday, several units of the <a href="10th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Frundsberg">10th SS Panzer Division</a>, 12th SS Panzer Division and <a href="116th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">116th Panzer Division</a> managed to break through the Polish lines and open a corridor, while the 9th SS Panzer Division prevented the Canadians from intervening. By mid-afternoon, about 10,000 German troops had passed out of the pocket.
The Poles held on to Hill 262 (The Mace), and were able from their vantage point to direct artillery fire on to the retreating Germans. <a href="Paul%20Hausser">Paul Hausser</a>, the 7th Army commander, ordered that the Polish positions be "eliminated". The remnants of the <a href="352nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">352nd Infantry Division</a> and several battle groups from the 2nd SS Panzer Division inflicted many casualties on the 8th and 9th battalions of the Polish Division, but the assault was eventually repulsed at the cost of nearly all of their ammunition, and the Poles watched as the remnants of the XLVII Panzer Corps escaped. During the night there was sporadic fighting, and the Poles called for frequent artillery bombardments to disrupt the German retreat from the sector.
German attacks resumed the next morning, but the Poles retained their foothold on the ridge. At about 11:00, a final attempt on the positions of the 9th Battalion was launched by nearby SS troops, which was defeated at close quarters. Soon after midday, the <a href="The%20Canadian%20Grenadier%20Guards">Canadian Grenadier Guards</a> reached Mont Ormel, and by late afternoon the remainder of the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions had begun their retreat to the Seine. For the Falaise pocket operation, the 1st Polish Armoured Division listed 1,441 casualties including 466 killed, while Polish casualties at Mont Ormel were 351 killed and wounded, with eleven tanks lost. German losses in their assaults on the ridge were and 1,000 men taken prisoner, most from the 12th SS-Panzer Division. Scores of <a href="Tiger%20I">Tiger</a>, Panther and Panzer IV tanks were destroyed, along with many artillery pieces.

By the evening of 21 August, tanks of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division had linked with Polish forces at <a href="Coudehard">Coudehard</a>, and the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry divisions had secured St. Lambert and the northern passage to Chambois; the Falaise pocket had been sealed. Approximately 20–50,000 German troops, minus heavy equipment, escaped through the gap and were reorganized and rearmed, in time to slow the Allied advance into the Netherlands and Germany.

The Battle of the Falaise Pocket ended the Battle of Normandy with a decisive German defeat. Hitler's involvement had been damaging from the first, with his insistence on hopelessly unrealistic counter-offensives, <a href="micro-management">micro-management</a> of generals, and refusal to countenance withdrawal when his armies were threatened with annihilation. More than forty German divisions were destroyed during the Battle of Normandy. No exact figures are available, but historians estimate that the battle cost the German forces , of whom killed or wounded. The Allies had achieved victory at a cost of among the ground forces, including and . The Allied air forces lost killed or missing in connection with Operation Overlord. The final battle of Operation Overlord, the <a href="Liberation%20of%20Paris">Liberation of Paris</a>, followed on 25 August, and Overlord ended by 30 August, with the retreat of the last German unit across the Seine.

The area in which the pocket had formed was full of the remains of battle. Villages had been destroyed, and derelict equipment made some roads impassable. Corpses of soldiers and civilians littered the area, along with thousands of dead cattle and horses. In the hot August weather, maggots crawled over the bodies, and swarms of flies descended on the area. Pilots reported being able to smell the stench of the battlefield hundreds of feet above it. General Eisenhower recorded that:

Fear of infection from the rancid conditions led the Allies to declare the area an "unhealthy zone". Clearing the area was a low priority though, and went on until well into November. Many swollen bodies had to be shot to expunge gasses within them before they could be burnt, and bulldozers were used to clear the area of dead animals.

Disappointed that a significant portion of the 7th Army had escaped from the pocket, many Allied commanders, particularly among the Americans, were critical of what they perceived as Montgomery's lack of urgency in closing the pocket. Writing shortly after the war, <a href="Ralph%20Ingersoll%20%28PM%20publisher%29">Ralph Ingersoll</a>—a prominent peacetime journalist, who had served as a planner on Eisenhower's staff—expressed the prevailing American view at the time:

Some historians have thought that the gap could have been closed earlier; <a href="Chester%20Wilmot">Wilmot</a> wrote that despite having British divisions in reserve, Montgomery did not reinforce <a href="Guy%20Simonds">Guy Simonds</a> and that the Canadian drive on Trun and Chambois was not "vigorous and venturesome" as the situation demanded. The British author and historian Max Hastings wrote that Montgomery, having witnessed what he called a poor Canadian performance during Totalize, should have brought up veteran British divisions to take the lead. <a href="Carlo%20D%27Este">D'Este</a> and <a href="Martin%20Blumenson">Blumenson</a> wrote that Montgomery and <a href="Harry%20Crerar">Harry Crerar</a> might have done more to impart momentum to the British and Canadians. Patton's post-battle claim that the Americans could have prevented the German escape, had Bradley not ordered him to stop at Argentan, was "absurd over-simplification".
Wilmot wrote that "contrary to contemporary reports, the Americans did not capture Argentan until 20 August, the day after the link up at Chambois". The American unit that closed the gap between Argentan and Chambois, the <a href="90th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">90th Division</a>, was according to Hastings one of the least effective of any Allied army in Normandy. He speculated that the real reason Bradley halted Patton was not fear of accidental clashes with the British, but knowledge that, with powerful German formations still operational, the Americans lacked the means to defend an early blocking position and would have suffered an "embarrassing and gratuitous setback" at the hands of the retreating "<a href="Fallschirmj%C3%A4ger%20%28Nazi%20Germany%29">Fallschirmjäger</a>" and the 2nd and 12th "SS-Panzer" divisions. Bradley wrote after the war that:

By 22 August, all German forces west of the Allied lines were dead or in captivity. Historians differ in their estimates of German losses in the pocket. The majority state that from were caught in the encirclement, of whom killed, taken prisoner, and . <a href="Milton%20Shulman">Shulman</a>, Wilmot and <a href="Lionel%20Ellis">Ellis</a> estimated that the remnants of were in the pocket.

Although elements of several German formations had managed to escape to the east, even these had left behind most of their equipment. After the battle, Allied investigators estimated that the Germans lost around and assault guns in the pocket, and that little of the extricated equipment survived the retreat across the Seine.

The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run

The Simpsons: Hit & Run is a <a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20clone">"Grand Theft Auto" clone</a> <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> video game developed by <a href="Radical%20Entertainment">Radical Entertainment</a> and published by <a href="Vivendi%20Games">Vivendi Universal Games</a>, for <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>, <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. It is based on the American <a href="animated%20sitcom">animated sitcom</a> "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", and is the twenty-second installment in the <a href="List%20of%20The%20Simpsons%20video%20games">"Simpsons"</a> series. It was released on September 16, 2003. 

The game follows the <a href="Simpson%20family">Simpson family</a> and their friend <a href="Apu%20Nahasapeemapetilon">Apu Nahasapeemapetilon</a>, who witness many strange incidents that occur in <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Springfield</a>; security cameras, mysterious vans, <a href="crop%20circle">crop circle</a>s, and a "new and improved" flavor of the popular soft drink <a href="Products%20produced%20from%20The%20Simpsons%23Buzz%20Cola">Buzz Cola</a>, which causes <a href="insanity">insanity</a>. Taking matters into their own hands, they discover numerous shocking secrets, and soon realize these incidents are part of a larger alien conspiracy, caused by <a href="Kang%20and%20Kodos">Kang and Kodos</a>. Gameplay largely focuses on exploration and missions; players often race enemies and interact with supporting characters on timed quests. The game also features many elements found in <a href="role-playing%20games">role-playing games</a>, such as a branching storyline and side tasks. 

Announced in early 2002, the development of "The Simpsons: Hit & Run" was extensive. The team sought to differentiate the game from "", deeming their new entry into the franchise required a different direction. The game was heavily inspired by "<a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III">Grand Theft Auto III</a>", and the development team re-purposed the open-world design and nuanced character development for the game. This encouraged collaboration with the show's <a href="List%20of%20The%20Simpsons%20writers">writers</a> and <a href="List%20of%20cast%20members%20of%20The%20Simpsons">cast</a>, who helped craft the story and dialogue.

Upon release, it received generally favorable reviews from video game critics, with praise particularly focused on the interpretation of "The Simpsons" television series as a video game, its parodical take on "Grand Theft Auto III", and graphics, while criticism mostly surrounded some aspects of gameplay, such as bugs and glitches. The game was also a commercial success, with recorded sales of over 3 million worldwide. It received the award for Fave Video Game at the 2004 <a href="Nickelodeon%20Australian%20Kids%27%20Choice%20Awards">Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards</a>, and is widely considered the best game in the series. 

"Hit & Run" has seven levels, each with missions and a sub-plot. The player can control one specific character in each level. The game's playable characters are <a href="Homer%20Simpson">Homer</a>, <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart</a>, <a href="Lisa%20Simpson">Lisa</a>, <a href="Marge%20Simpson">Marge</a>, and <a href="Apu%20Nahasapeemapetilon">Apu</a>, with Homer and Bart being playable twice each. When travelling on foot, the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> can walk, run, and perform three types of <a href="Melee%20%28gaming%29">melee</a> attacks: a normal kick, a jumping kick, and a smashing move. To drive, the player can either commandeer one of the many civilian vehicles that drive endlessly around town, or use a phone booth to select a car. Several <a href="Easter_egg_%28media%29%23In_video_games">hidden vehicles</a> are present in each level and can also be used by the player if found. The game's driving missions are also similar to those of "Grand Theft Auto III". In both games, the player races against other characters, collects items before a timer runs out, and wrecks other cars.

The game has a <a href="Nonlinear%20gameplay%23Sandbox%20mode">sandbox-style</a> format that emphasizes driving, and the player controls their character from a <a href="third-person%20shooter">third-person</a> view. The character can perform certain acts of violence, such as attacking pedestrians, blowing up vehicles, and destroying the environment. "The Simpsons: Hit & Run" has a warning meter that indicates when the police will retaliate for bad behaviour. Located in the bottom-right corner of the screen, the circular "<a href="Hit%20and%20run%20%28vehicular%29">hit and run</a>" meter fills up when the character runs people over or destroys objects, and decreases when they cease doing so. When full, several police cars chase the character for the duration of the hit and run. In Level 7, instead of standard police cars, zombie police hearses chase the character.

Each level contains items the player can collect, such as coins, which can be gathered by either smashing Buzz Cola vending machines, Buzz Cola boxes or wasp cameras, the latter of which become more elusive as the game progresses. The coins can be used to buy new cars and player outfits, some of which are required to progress through the game. The player can also collect <a href="The%20Itchy%20%26amp%3B%20Scratchy%20Show">Itchy and Scratchy</a> cards. By collecting all 49 of them, seven in each level, the player unlocks a special "The Itchy & Scratchy Show" video. Several events cause the player to lose coins; because the character cannot die, injuries cause the player to lose coins. If the player is apprehended during a hit and run, they will be <a href="Fine%20%28penalty%29">fined</a> 50 coins.

Mysterious happenings are occurring in <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Springfield</a>, including <a href="wasp">wasp</a>-shaped security cameras, mysterious black surveillance vans, <a href="crop%20circles">crop circles</a>, and a "new and improved" flavor of the popular soft drink <a href="Products%20produced%20from%20The%20Simpsons%23Buzz%20Cola">Buzz Cola</a>. A horde of these wasps descend upon the city at the beginning of the game. One enters <a href="The%20Simpsons%20house">the Simpsons' home</a> and is smashed by Homer, emitting coins. Homer picks up one of the coins, and watches a commercial for the new Buzz Cola on TV, hosted by <a href="Krusty%20the%20Clown">Krusty the Clown</a>, noticing the logo on the coin resembles that of Buzz Cola. Homer decides he must go out and try some Buzz Cola.

Homer at first goes to the <a href="Kwik-E-Mart">Kwik-E-Mart</a> and purchases Buzz Cola, then gets into more routine tasks, such as giving Lisa her science project or going to work. At the end of the day, Homer is sent home from work and watches a news report on TV, which informs him that the mysterious cameras and black vans are being spotted all across town. He notices one of the vans spying on him outside the house, and decides to pursue it, leading him to <a href="Mr.%20Burns">Mr. Burns</a>' mansion. Homer concludes that Mr. Burns is responsible for the wasps, and goes to confront him. However, Burns reveals that the black vans are simply pizza delivery vans, and proceeds to fire and release his guard dogs on Homer.

The next day, Bart skips school in search of the new game, "Bonestorm II". After evading <a href="Principal%20Skinner">Principal Skinner</a>, he does tasks for certain people who give him a lead onto finding the game. The trail leads him to <a href="Professor%20Frink">Professor Frink</a> who, in turn for a few errands, lets Bart see the new Truckasaurus, a giant mechanical dinosaur. Bart is nearly attacked by it, but escapes before disappearing in a <a href="tractor%20beam">tractor beam</a>.

Lisa attempts to find her brother by exploring the Squidport area for clues. She learns from <a href="Abraham%20Simpson">Grampa</a> that black <a href="Sedan%20%28automobile%29">sedans</a> that have been appearing around town are connected to Bart's disappearance, she also learns from <a href="Chief%20Wiggum">Chief Wiggum</a> that government-style agents have been appearing across the Squidport area. Lisa destroys the sedans, but finds them to be empty. After completing a task for the <a href="Sea%20Captain%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Sea Captain</a>, she destroys a black limo but discovers Bart got out of it and boarded a ship. She finds Bart on the ship; he appears to have <a href="memory%20loss">memory loss</a> and is mumbling unintelligibly, as well as soiling his pants, while occasionally mentioning the sedans and Buzz Cola.

Marge sets out to learn what has affected Bart. As she investigates a <a href="crop%20circle">crop circle</a> that recently appeared in <a href="Cletus%20Spuckler">Cletus Spuckler</a>'s crop field, Grampa tells her that the crop circle resembles the Buzz Cola logo. Marge gives a can of the cola to Bart, which snaps him out of his gibberish state of mind. Bart reveals that the new Buzz Cola is an alien <a href="Mind%20control">mind-control agent</a>, which he was given while abducted. Marge decides to purge Springfield of cola trucks, but in spite of her efforts, the drink still maintains its popularity with consumers.

Inspired by Marge's efforts, Apu sets out to discover the source of Buzz Cola, remorseful for selling it in the first place. After some unsuccessful leads, he finally comes across <a href="Snake%20Jailbird">Snake Jailbird</a>, who tells him that the cola trucks are registered to the Springfield Museum of Natural History. Apu and Bart get to the museum, where they find a meteor as the source of the cola. They eavesdrop on a conversation between aliens <a href="Kang%20and%20Kodos">Kang and Kodos</a>, who are the masterminds behind the new cola and the wasp cameras. Apu and Bart learn that the wasp cameras are filming the antics of Springfield for an intergalactic reality show, "Foolish Earthlings". With the show's ratings hitting an all-time low, the aliens are using the cola to make people insane; the next stage of their plot is to distribute laser guns among the populace to drive the town to a violent massacre sure to draw many viewers.

Terrified by Kang and Kodos' plan, Apu refuses to help any further and feigns insanity, so Bart takes it upon himself to foil the aliens' plan. He asks Krusty for help, but Krusty informs Bart that he has already helped the <a href="Duff%20Beer">Duff Brewery</a> set up free laser gun stands around Springfield. Bart then goes to his father, Homer, for help, and the duo quickly pursue Kang and Kodos to the brewery. However, the aliens escape, and before departing, they reveal that they have already released Buzz Cola throughout Springfield's water supply. As the cola seeps into the ground, it releases the <a href="zombie">undead</a> from the Springfield Cemetery, who invade Springfield.

On <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a>, when Homer collects supplies to protect his family and home from the marauding zombies, he decides to pursue a black sports car—which is a probe for the aliens' ship—to the <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29%23Springfield%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant">Springfield Nuclear Power Plant</a>. There, he finds <a href="Professor%20Frink">Professor Frink</a>, who has discovered the aliens' weakness: <a href="Radioactive%20waste">nuclear waste</a>. He plans to use the alien ship's tractor beam to suck up cars that are loaded with barrels of nuclear waste. After successfully loading Frink's car, along with three more, into the aliens' tractor beam, the ship explodes. The following day, Springfield is returned to normal, and Homer is seen as a celebrity among the alien viewers of "Foolish Earthlings." Kang and Kodos, who were killed in the explosion and are now in Heaven, are seen questioning how they died on earth and went to "Earth Heaven."

The developer, <a href="Radical%20Entertainment">Radical Entertainment</a>, received the rights to create games for "The Simpsons" franchise when they demonstrated a playable prototype. Radical released its first "The Simpsons" game in 2001, called "". After "Road Rage" was released, the development team for "Hit & Run" decided not to create a direct sequel to "Road Rage" (although there are files in the game's core that refers to it as "The Simpsons: Road Rage 2"); instead, Radical wanted to steer the franchise's video game series in a different direction by giving the <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> a complete overhaul. The developers felt that everything else needed a new approach, while only the driving portion of "Road Rage" was worth keeping; in "Hit & Run", enhanced traffic <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> is introduced, which makes computer-controlled vehicles react better to the player's driving. They also decided to add an exploration element to the game to make players get out of the car and navigate the area on foot, so that the game offered a better experience of <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Springfield</a>. The internal development name for "The Simpsons: Hit & Run" was simply "Simpsons", as referenced by the executable file of the game.

When developing the graphics, the team decided to include landmarks from Springfield. The player is able to enter some of them, including the <a href="Kwik-E-Mart">Kwik-E-Mart</a>, <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29%23Moe%27s%20Tavern">Moe's Tavern</a>, <a href="Springfield%20Elementary%20School">Springfield Elementary School</a>, and <a href="Comic%20Book%20Guy%23The%20Android%27s%20Dungeon">The Android's Dungeon and Baseball Card Shop</a>. During "Hit & Run"s development, <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>, <a href="Gracie%20Films">Gracie Films</a> and <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a>, the creator of "The Simpsons", played important roles in bringing "The Simpsons" universe into a 3D environment. All character voices were supplied by the <a href="List%20of%20cast%20members%20of%20The%20Simpsons">actual cast</a>, and the series' writers wrote the entire story for the game, including dialogue. Tim Ramage, the associate producer of the game's publisher, <a href="Vivendi%20Games">Vivendi Universal Games</a>, considered it a blessing to have the opportunity of working with <a href="List%20of%20cast%20members%20of%20The%20Simpsons">"The Simpsons" cast</a>, along with the writers, whom Ramage called "the best there is ".

"Hit & Run" received "generally favorable" reviews on all platforms according to the <a href="Review%20aggregator">review aggregation</a> website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, and many consider it to be the best "Simpsons" game to date. Praise focused on the move from the "Simpsons" television series to the video game format, while criticism targeted some aspects of gameplay. "Hit & Run" won the award for Fave Video Game at the 2004 <a href="Nickelodeon%20Kids%27%20Choice%20Awards">Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards</a>. Over one million copies of the game were sold as of June 2004, and three million as of July 2007. The game's PlayStation 2 version received a "Diamond" sales award from the <a href="Entertainment%20and%20Leisure%20Software%20Publishers%20Association">Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</a> (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 1 million copies in the United Kingdom.

A number of reviews complimented the transposition of the "Simpsons" television series to a video game. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" and <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> commented on how well the game depicted the fictional city of <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Springfield</a> from the television series, and called it the most accurate representation of Springfield ever put into a game. "<a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a>" said that the game did the show justice, and "<a href="Play%20%28US%20magazine%29">Play</a>" felt that it was "essentially the show in real time", summing up its review by calling the game a "truly great cross-over product". GameSpot thought that the humor that the game offered included many excellent self-referential jokes, and <a href="TeamXbox">TeamXbox</a> concluded its review by predicting that the game would be extremely appealing to gamers, especially hardcore "Simpsons" fans. Entertainment magazine "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" surmised that "Hit & Run" was the first "Simpsons" game to include humor comparable to what was in the television series.

"Hit & Run"s parodical take on the "<a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto%20III">Grand Theft Auto III</a>" video game was praised by several reviewers. It was considered to "deftly satirize "Grand Theft Auto" while being almost as entertaining" in a review by <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>, which suggested that "Hit & Run" improved several gameplay aspects that it borrowed from "Grand Theft Auto", including instant mission restarts, a superior guidance system, and an easily accessible collection of vehicles. "Official Xbox Magazine" agreed that "Hit & Run" was an excellent game in its own right, and found the game to be a "brilliant" <a href="Grand_Theft_Auto_clone">clone</a> of "Grand Theft Auto". The combination of the "Simpsons" universe with the gameplay of the "Grand Theft Auto" series was also praised by IGN as "pure brilliance".

Positive reviews of "Hit & Run" focused on its graphics and gameplay. "Play" appreciated the virtual world that the game offered, describing it as "grandiose in its expanse and artistic rendering". GameSpot found the gameplay to be very engaging. The game was found to be "very fun and very funny" by Zach Meston of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>, and "Game Informer" called it "nothing short of astonishing". Despite positive reactions, the game also had serious issues that were brought up in several reviews, which focused on the game's bugs and glitches. Both TeamXbox and <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> pointed out that "Hit & Run" had a few gameplay issues and graphical shortcomings that included strange artificial intelligence behaviour and a broken <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system">camera system</a>, which they felt hindered the overall experience of the game.

Coldrum Long Barrow

The Coldrum Long Barrow, also known as the Coldrum Stones and the Adscombe Stones, is a <a href="chambered%20long%20barrow">chambered long barrow</a> located near the village of <a href="Trottiscliffe">Trottiscliffe</a> in the <a href="South%20East%20England">south-eastern</a> <a href="England">English</a> county of <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. Probably constructed in the <a href="4th%20millennium%20BC">fourth millennium</a> <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>, during Britain's <a href="Neolithic%20British%20Isles">Early Neolithic</a> period, today it survives only in a state of <a href="Ruins">ruin</a>.

<a href="Archaeology">Archaeologists</a> have established that the monument was built by <a href="pastoralism">pastoralist</a> communities shortly after the introduction of <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of <a href="long%20barrow">long barrow</a> building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, the Coldrum Stones belong to a localised regional variant of barrows produced in the vicinity of the <a href="River%20Medway">River Medway</a>, now known as the <a href="Medway%20Megaliths">Medway Megaliths</a>. Of these, it is in the best surviving condition. It lies near to both <a href="Addington%20Long%20Barrow">Addington Long Barrow</a> and <a href="Chestnuts%20Long%20Barrow">Chestnuts Long Barrow</a> on the western side of the river. Three further surviving long barrows, <a href="Kit%27s%20Coty%20House">Kit's Coty House</a>, the <a href="Little%20Kit%27s%20Coty%20House">Little Kit's Coty House</a>, and the <a href="Coffin%20Stone">Coffin Stone</a>, are located on the Medway's eastern side.

Built out of earth and around fifty local <a href="sarsen">sarsen</a> <a href="megalith">megalith</a>s, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen <a href="tumulus">tumulus</a> enclosed by kerb-stones. Within the eastern end of the tumulus was a stone chamber, into which human remains were deposited on at least two separate occasions during the Early Neolithic. <a href="Bioarchaeology">Osteoarchaeological</a> analysis of these remains has shown them to be those of at least seventeen individuals, a mixture of men, women, children and adults. At least one of the bodies had been dismembered before burial, potentially reflecting a funerary tradition of <a href="excarnation">excarnation</a> and <a href="secondary%20burial">secondary burial</a>. As with other barrows, Coldrum has been interpreted as a tomb to house the remains of the dead, perhaps as part of a belief system involving <a href="veneration%20of%20the%20dead">ancestor veneration</a>, although archaeologists have suggested that it may also have had further religious, ritual, and cultural connotations and uses.

After the Early Neolithic, the long barrow fell into a state of ruined dilapidation, perhaps experiencing deliberate destruction in the Late Medieval period, either by <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> iconoclasts or treasure hunters. In local <a href="folklore">folklore</a>, the site became associated with the burial of a prince and the <a href="countless%20stones">countless stones</a> motif. The ruin attracted the interest of <a href="antiquarianism">antiquarians</a> in the 19th century, while <a href="excavation%20%28archaeology%29">archaeological excavation</a> took place in the early 20th. In 1926, ownership was transferred to heritage charity <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">The National Trust</a>. Open without charge to visitors all year around, the stones are the site of a <a href="Wish%20tree">rag tree</a>, a <a href="May%20Day">May Day</a> <a href="morris%20dance">morris dance</a>, and various <a href="Modern%20Paganism">modern Pagan</a> rituals.

The Coldrum Stones are named after a nearby farm, Coldrum Lodge, which has since been demolished. The monument lies in a "rather isolated site" north-east of the nearby village of <a href="Trottiscliffe">Trottiscliffe</a>, in the south-eastern English county of <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. The site is also positioned about 500 metres (547 yards) from a prehistoric track known as the <a href="Pilgrim%27s%20Way">Pilgrim's Way</a>. The tomb can be reached along a pathway known as Coldrum Lane, which is only accessible on foot. The nearest car park to Coldrum Lane can be found off of Pinesfield Lane in Trottiscliffe. The village of <a href="Addington%2C%20Kent">Addington</a> is located 5.23 kilometres (one and a quarter miles) away.

The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> adopted <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> lifestyle that had characterised the preceding <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> and its proximity to the continent.

Britain was largely forested in this period; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the <a href="Bronze%20Age%20Britain">Late Bronze Age</a> (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from the vicinity of the <a href="White%20Horse%20Stone">White Horse Stone</a>, a putatively prehistoric <a href="monolith">monolith</a> near the <a href="River%20Medway">River Medway</a>, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and <a href="Maloideae">Maloideae</a>. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely <a href="pastoralism">pastoral</a>, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.

Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These structures included <a href="chambered%20long%20barrow">chambered long barrow</a>s, rectangular or oval earthen <a href="tumulus">tumuli</a> which had a chamber built into one end. Some of these chambers were constructed out of timber, although others were built using large stones, now known as "<a href="megalith">megalith</a>s". These long barrows often served as tombs, housing the physical remains of the dead within their chamber. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. These chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from southeastern Spain up to southern Sweden, taking in most of the British Isles; the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. Although there are stone buildings—like <a href="G%C3%B6bekli%20Tepe">Göbekli Tepe</a> in modern Turkey—which predate them, the chambered long barrows constitute humanity's first widespread tradition of construction using stone.

Although now all in a ruinous state and not retaining their original appearance, at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain. Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the <a href="North%20Downs">North Downs</a>, they constitute the most southeasterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles, and the only megalithic group in eastern England. The archaeologists Brian Philp and Mike Dutto deemed the Medway Megaliths to be "some of the most interesting and well known" archaeological sites in Kent, while the archaeologist <a href="Paul%20Ashbee">Paul Ashbee</a> described them as "the most grandiose and impressive structures of their kind in southern England".

The Medway Megaliths can be divided into two separate clusters: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on <a href="Blue%20Bell%20Hill">Blue Bell Hill</a> to the east, with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between 8 and 10 kilometres (5 and 6 miles). The western group includes Coldrum Long Barrow, <a href="Addington%20Long%20Barrow">Addington Long Barrow</a>, and the <a href="Chestnuts%20Long%20Barrow">Chestnuts Long Barrow</a>. The eastern group consists of <a href="Kit%27s%20Coty%20House">Kit's Coty House</a>, <a href="Little%20Kit%27s%20Coty%20House">Little Kit's Coty House</a>, the <a href="Coffin%20Stone">Coffin Stone</a>, and several other stones which might have once been parts of chambered tombs. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.

The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from <a href="sarsen">sarsen</a>, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected.

These common architectural features among the Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles. For instance, they would have been taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain, with internal heights of up to 3.8 metres (10 feet). Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows—like the <a href="Severn-Cotswold%20tomb">Cotswold-Severn group</a> in south-western Britain—there are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum's rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow's facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit's Coty. These variations might have been caused by the tombs being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would be composite structures.

The people who built these monuments were probably influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines that they were already aware of. Whether those people had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known. Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs, the archaeologist <a href="Stuart%20Piggott">Stuart Piggott</a> thought that the plan behind the Medway Megaliths had originated in the area around the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>, while fellow archaeologist <a href="Glyn%20Daniel">Glyn Daniel</a> instead believed that the same evidence showed an influence from Scandinavia. John H. Evans instead suggested an origin in Germany, and Ronald F. Jessup thought that their origins could be seen in the Cotswold-Severn megalithic group. Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe, and emphasised that the Medway Megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe. He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was "impossible to indicate" with the available evidence.

The Coldrum Long Barrow originally consisted of a sarsen stone chamber, covered by a low earthen mound, which was bounded by prostrate slabs. As such, Ashbee asserted that the monument could be divided into three particular features: the chamber, the barrow, and the sarsen stone surround. It had been built using about 50 stones. The barrow is sub-rectangular in plan, and about 20 metres (64 feet) in length. At its broader, eastern end, where the chamber is located, the monument measures 15 metres (50 feet), while at the narrower, western end, it is 12 metres (40 feet) in breadth. As such, the barrow is a "truncated wedge-shape".

The megalithic builders responsible for the Coldrum Stones positioned it on the top of a small ridge adjacent to the North Downs, and constructed it facing eastward, towards the River Medway. It is located on the edge of a large <a href="lynchet">lynchet</a> scarp, although it is difficult to ascertain what views would have been possible from the monument at the time of construction, due to a lack of information on how densely forested the vicinity was. If the area was not highly wooded, then 360° views of the surrounding landscape would have been possible. The monument's axis points toward both the North Downs and the Medway Valley, which is similar to the other Medway Megaliths. The archaeologist Sian Killick suggested that the Coldrum Long Barrow might have been built within view of a nearby settlement, and that this "may have been a key factor in the experience of ceremonies and rituals taking place at the tombs and may also have defined a link between the tomb builders and the landscape."

Coldrum Long Barrow is comparatively isolated from the other Medway Megaliths; in this it is unique, given that the other surviving examples are clustered into two groups. It is possible that another chambered tomb was located nearby; a razed, elongated earthen mound with an east–west orientation is located in a hollow at the foot of the downs just under a quarter of a mile north of the Coldrum Stones. It may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried. Several large sarsens south of the Coldrums might represent the remnants of a further such tomb, since destroyed.

The inner chamber measures 4.5 metres (13 feet) in length, and 1.7 metres (5 feet, 6 inches) in width, although it was potentially much larger when originally constructed. The chamber's internal height would have been at least 2 metres (6 feet, 6 inches). In its current state, the northern side of the chamber is made up of two slabs. One is 2.44 metres (8 feet) long, 2.29 metres (7 feet, 6 inches) deep, and 53 centimetres (1 foot, 9 inches) thick; the other is 1.52 centimetres (5 feet) long, 1.83 (6 feet) deep, and 61 centimetres (2 feet) thick. Conversely, the chamber's southern side consists of a single slab, measuring 3.45 metres (11 feet, 4 inches) in length, 2.21 metres (7 feet, 3 inches) in depth, and 53 centimetres (1 foot, 9 inches) in thickness at its eastern end.

The western end of the chamber is closed off with a slab measuring about 4.42 metres (14 feet, 6 inches) wide, with a thickness of 30 centimetres (1 foot) and a depth of around 2.44 metres (8 feet). A collapsed, broken slab lies at the chamber's opening, eastern end. It is also possible that a largely rectangular slab at the bottom of the slope had once been part of the chamber's eastern end. Excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens; 20th-century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement, allowing the stones to continue standing upright.

It is possible that there was a facade in front of the chamber, as is evident at other chambered tombs in Britain, such as <a href="West%20Kennet%20Long%20Barrow">West Kennet Long Barrow</a> and <a href="Wayland%27s%20Smithy">Wayland's Smithy</a>. It is also possible that there was a <a href="megalithic%20architectural%20elements%23Portal%20stones">portal stone</a> atop the chamber, as was apparent at Kit's Coty House and Lower Kit's Coty House. Many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal.

The earthen mound that once covered the tomb is now visible only as an undulation approximately 46 centimetres (1 foot, 6 inches) in height. In the 19th century, the mound was higher on the western end of the tomb, although during the 1920s this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens beneath. It is probable that in the Early Neolithic, the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it, and it is inside this ditch that the kerb-stones now sit.

The kerb-stones around the tomb display some patterning; those on the northern side are mostly rectilinear, while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape. It is probable that there was an ancillary dry-stone wall constructed using blocks of <a href="ironstone">ironstone</a> from the geological <a href="Lower%20Greensand%20Group">Folkestone beds</a>, as is evident at Chestnuts Long Barrow. Given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally, it may have been quarried.

A concave line of abrasion and polishing can be found on both one of the central kerb-stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb-stone on the south-east of the monument. These have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe-blades on these sarsens. It is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber levers and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb. Similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>.

The Early Neolithic people of Britain placed far greater emphasis on the ritualised burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears had done. Many archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic people adhered to an <a href="Veneration%20of%20the%20dead">ancestor cult</a> that venerated the spirits of the dead, believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants. The archaeologist Robin Holgate stressed that rather than simply being tombs, the Medway Megaliths were "communal monuments fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them." Thus, it has furthermore been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered into the tombs—which doubled as <a href="temple">temple</a>s or <a href="shrine">shrine</a>s—to perform rituals that would honour the dead and ask for their assistance. For this reason, the historian <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> termed these monuments "tomb-shrines" to reflect their dual purpose.

In Britain, these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the surrounding landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories. The archaeologist <a href="Caroline%20Malone">Caroline Malone</a> noted that the tombs would have served as one of a variety of markers in the landscape that conveyed information on "territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors." Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb-shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups, although others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society. Instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways. Many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over the land, thus representing a change in mindset brought about by the transition from the hunter-gatherer Mesolithic to the pastoralist Early Neolithic. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.

Within the chamber were placed human remains, which have been discovered and removed at intervals during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Early twentieth century excavation found two separate deposits of bone, each buried atop a stone slab, one higher than the other. Also buried within the chamber were flint tools and small quantities of pottery.

Ashbee suggested that—taking into account both its size and comparisons with other long barrows, such as <a href="Fussell%27s%20Lodge">Fussell's Lodge</a>—the Coldrum tomb could have housed the remains of over a hundred individuals. Excavations conducted in the early 20th century have led to the methodical discovery and removal of what was believed to be the remains of twenty-two human individuals. These remains were examined by Sir Arthur Keith, the conservator of the museum at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons">Royal College of Surgeons</a>. He published his results in 1913, in a paper largely concerned with <a href="Craniometry">discerning racial characteristics of the bodies</a>. He ended his paper with the conclusion that "the people of pre-Christian Kent were physically not very different from the Kentish man of the Christian period".

A subsequent re-analysis of the bones was conducted in the early 21st century by a team led by the forensic <a href="taphonomy">taphonomist</a> Michael Wysocki; their results were published in 2013. Wysocki's team conducted "osteological analysis, Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates, and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis" in order to discover more about the "demography, burial practices, diet and subsistence, and chronology of the Coldrum population". Disputing earlier conclusions, it stated that the minimum number of individuals was seventeen. These were then further identified as probably belonging to nine adults (probably five males and four females), two sub-adults (probably 16 to 20 years old), four older children, and two younger children (one around five years old, the other between 24 and 30 months old).

Keith believed that the crania he examined displayed similar features, suggesting that the different individuals all belonged to "one family - or several families united by common descent." Similar observations had been made regarding the crania from other long barrows in Britain, although <a href="bioarchaeology">osteoarchaeologists</a> Martin Smith and Megan Brickley noted that this was not necessarily representative of a family group. Instead, they stated that it would also be consistent with "a population that was still relatively small and scattered", in which most individuals were interrelated.

Wysocki's team noted that in all but one case, the fracture morphologies of the bones are consistent with dry-bone breakage.
Three of the skulls displayed evidence that they had experienced violence; a probable adult female had an unhealed injury on the left <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal bone</a>, an adult of indeterminate sex had an unhealed fracture on the left frontal, and a second adult female had a healed depressed fracture on the right frontal.

<a href="Isotope%20analysis">Isotope analysis</a> of the remains revealed that while the bones had <a href="%CE%B413C">δC</a> values that were typical of those found at many other southern British Neolithic sites, they had significantly higher values of <a href="%CE%B415N">δN</a>, which grew over time. Although this data is difficult to interpret, the investigative team believed that it probably reflected that these individuals had had a terrestrial diet high in animal protein that over time was increasingly supplemented with freshwater river or estuarine foods. In the case of the older individuals whose remains were interned in the tomb, the <a href="tooth%20enamel">tooth enamel</a> was worn away and the <a href="dentine">dentine</a> had become exposed on the chewing area of the crowns.

<a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">Radiocarbon dating</a> of the human remains suggested that some were brought to the site between either 3980–3800 <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating%23Reporting%20dates">calibrated</a> BCE (95% probability) or 3960–3880 cal BCE (68% probability). It further suggested that after an interval of either 60–350 years (95% probability) or 140–290 years (68% probability), additional depositions of human remains were made inside the tomb. This second phase probably began in 3730–3540 cal BCE (95% probability) or 3670–3560 cal BCE (68% probability).
The radiocarbon dating of the human remains does not provide a date for the construction of Coldrum Long Barrow itself, because it is possible that the individuals died either some time before or after the monument's construction.

Cut-marks were identified on a number of the bones (two <a href="Femur">femora</a>, two <a href="Hip%20bone">innominates</a>, and one cranium), with osteoarchaeological specialists suggesting that these had been created post-mortem as the bodies were dismembered and the bones removed from their attached ligaments. They further suggested that the absence of cut-marks on certain bones suggested that the body had already undergone partial decomposition or the removal of soft tissues prior to dismemberment. The precision of the cut-marks suggests that this dismemberment was done carefully; "they do not suggest frenzied hacking or mutilation." None of the criteria that osteoarchaeologists deem diagnostic of <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a> were found on the bones.

This cut-marked human bone assemblage represented the largest yet identified from within a Neolithic long barrow in southern Britain, although similar evidence for dismemberment has been found from other Neolithic British sites, such as West Trump, Eyford, Aldestrop, and Haddenham. There are two possibilities for how this material developed. The first is that the bodies of the dead were <a href="excarnation">excarnated</a> or exposed to the elements, followed by a secondary burial within the tomb. The second is that they were placed in the tomb, where the flesh decomposed, before the bodies were then rearranged within the tomb itself. These practices may have been accompanied by other ritualistic or ceremonial practices, direct evidence for which does not survive.

The inclusion of occupational debris like ceramic sherds over the bones was not unique to the site but common in chambered tombs from southern England. On the basis of an example discovered at Kit's Coty House, Ashbee thought it apparent that the contents of the Coldrum's chamber would have been compartmentalised by medial slabs, which served the same purpose as the side chambers of West Kennet and Wayland's Smithy.

All of the surviving megalithic tombs from the Early Neolithic period have suffered from neglect and the ravages of agriculture. Although Ashbee noted that the Coldrum Stones represent "Kent's least damaged megalithic long barrow", it too has suffered considerable damage, having become dilapidated and fallen apart over the six millennia since its original construction. Most prominently, the eastern side has largely collapsed, with the stones that once helped to hold up the side of the barrow having fallen to the bottom of the slope. Conversely, it is possible that the sarsens at the bottom of the slope were not part of the original monument, but were stones found in nearby fields which were deposited there by farmers.

Excavation of Chestnuts Long Barrow revealed that it had been systematically destroyed in one event, and Ashbee suggested that the same may have happened to the Coldrum Stones. He believed that the kerb-stones around the barrow were toppled, laid prostrate in the surrounding ditch, and then buried during the late 13th or early 14th century, by Christians seeking to obliterate non-Christian monuments. Conversely, the archaeologist John Alexander—who excavated Chestnuts in 1957—suggested that the Medway tombs were destroyed by robbers looking for treasure within them. As evidence, he pointed to the <a href="Close%20Roll">Close Roll</a> of 1237, which ordered the opening of <a href="tumulus">tumuli</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> in search for treasure, a practice which may have spread to Kent around the same time. Alexander believed that the destruction in Kent may have been brought about by a special commissioner, highlighting that the "expertness and thoroughness of the robbery" at Chestnuts would have necessitated resources beyond that which a local community could probably muster. Ashbee further suggested that in subsequent centuries, locals raided the damaged Coldrum tomb for loamy chalk and stone, which was then re-used as building material.

In a 1946 paper, the <a href="Folkloristics">folklorist</a> John H. Evans recorded the existence of a local folk belief that a battle was fought at the site of the Coldrum Stones, and that a "Black Prince" was buried within its chamber. He suggested that the tales of battles taking place at this site and at other Medway Megaliths had not developed independently among the local population but had "percolated down from the theories of antiquaries" who believed that the fifth-century <a href="Battle%20of%20Aylesford">Battle of Aylesford</a>, which was recorded in the ninth-century "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", took place in the area.

Evans also recorded a local folk belief applied to all of the Medway Megaliths and which had been widespread "up to the last generation"; this was that it was impossible for anyone to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments. This "<a href="countless%20stones">countless stones</a>" motif is not unique to the Medway region, and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in Britain. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although in an early 17th-century document it was applied to <a href="The%20Hurlers%20%28stone%20circles%29">The Hurlers</a>, a set of three stone circles in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an <a href="animism">animistic</a> understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own.

Several <a href="Modern%20Paganism">modern Pagan</a> religions are practiced at the Medway Megaliths, with Pagan activity having taken place at the Coldrum Stones from at least the late 1980s. These Pagans commonly associated the sites both with a concept of ancestry and of them being a source of "<a href="Energy%20%28esotericism%29">earth energy</a>". The scholar of religion Ethan Doyle White argued that these sites in particular were interpreted as having connections to the ancestors both because they were created by Neolithic peoples whom modern Pagans view as their "own spiritual ancestors" and because the sites were once chambered tombs, and thus held the remains of the dead, who themselves may have been perceived as ancestors. On this latter point, Pagan perspectives on these sites are shaped by older archaeological interpretations. The Pagans also cited the Megaliths as spots marking sources of "earth energy", often aligned on <a href="ley%20lines">ley lines</a>, an idea probably derived ultimately from the publications of <a href="Earth%20Mysteries">Earth Mysteries</a> proponents like <a href="John%20Michell%20%28writer%29">John Michell</a>.

Pagans sometimes visit the site alone or in pairs, there to <a href="Meditation">meditate</a>, <a href="prayer">pray</a>, or perform rituals, and some have reported experiencing <a href="Vision%20%28spirituality%29">visions</a> there. A <a href="Neo-Druidism">modern Druidic</a> group known as Roharn's Grove hold regular rites at the site, particularly during the eight festivals that make up the Pagan <a href="Wheel%20of%20the%20Year">Wheel of the Year</a>. The Coldrums have also witnessed Pagan <a href="rites%20of%20passage">rites of passage</a>; circa 2000, a <a href="Handfasting%20%28Neopaganism%29">handfasting</a>—or <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>n marriage ceremony—was held there. One member of the <a href="Odinic%20Rite">Odinic Rite</a>, a <a href="Heathenism%20%28new%20religious%20movement%29">Heathen</a> organisation, gave their "oath of profession" to the group at the Coldrum Stones because they felt a particularly positive energy exists there. Politically motivated rituals have also been held at the site. In the late 1990s, the South London branch of the <a href="Paganlink">Paganlink</a> organisation held a ritual at the Coldrum Stones in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the construction of the <a href="Channel%20Tunnel%20Rail%20Link">Channel Tunnel Rail Link</a> through the Medway Valley landscape. Another politically motivated Pagan rite was carried out there in the early 2010s by <a href="The%20Warrior%27s%20Call">The Warrior's Call</a>, a group seeking to prevent <a href="Hydraulic%20fracturing">fracking</a> <a href="Hydraulic%20fracturing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">in the United Kingdom</a> by invoking "the traditional spirits of <a href="Albion">Albion</a>" against it.

In the early 21st century, a tradition developed in which the Hartley Morris Men, a <a href="morris%20dancing">morris dancing</a> side, meet at the site at dawn every <a href="May%20Day">May Day</a> in order to "sing up the sun". This consists of dances performed within the stones on top of the barrow, followed by a song performed at the base of the monument. The trees overhanging the Coldrum Stones on its northern side have become <a href="Wish%20Tree">rag tree</a>s, with hundreds of ribbons in various colours having been tied to their branches. This is a folk custom that some Pagans engage in, although it is also carried out by many other individuals; one Pagan has been recorded as saying that she tied a ribbon to the tree with her young son, both to make a wish for an improved future and as an offering to the "spirit of place". As of early 2014, runic carvings written in the <a href="Elder%20Futhark">Elder Futhark</a> alphabet were also evident on the trunks of these trees, spelling the names of the Norse gods <a href="Thor">Thor</a> and <a href="Odin">Odin</a>; these had probably been carved by Heathens.

The earliest antiquarian accounts of Coldrum Long Barrow were never published. There are claims that at the start of the 19th century, the Reverend Mark Noble, <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29%23Anglican%20churches">Rector</a> of <a href="Barming">Barming</a>, prepared a plan of the site for "<a href="Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">Gentleman's Magazine</a>", although no copies have been produced to verify this. Between 1842 and 1844, the Reverend Beale Post authored "Druidical Remains at Coldrum", in which he described the monument, although it remained unpublished at the time. Associating the site with the <a href="druid">druid</a>s of <a href="British%20Iron%20Age">Britain's Iron Age</a>, Post's suggestion was that the name "Coldrum" derived from the <a href="Brittonic%20languages">linguistically Celtic</a> "Gael-Dun", and that <a href="Belgae">Belgic</a> chiefs were interred there. He further reported that in both 1804 and 1825, skulls had been found at the site. In 1844, an antiquarian named Thomas Wright published a note on the Coldrum Stones and other Medway Megaliths in "<a href="The%20Archaeological%20Journal">The Archaeological Journal</a>". Wright had been alerted to their existence by a local <a href="Vicar%20%28Anglicanism%29">vicar</a>, the Reverend Lambert B. Larking, and proceeded to visit them with him. Describing the Coldrums, Wright mentioned "a smaller circle of stones" to the others in the area, with "a subterranean cromlech in the middle". He further added that "it is a tradition of the peasantry that a continuous line of stones ran from Coldrum direct to the well-known monument called Kit's Cotty [sic] House", attributing this belief to various megaliths scattered throughout the landscape.

In 1857, the antiquarian J. M. Kemble excavated at the site with the help of the Reverend Larking, providing a report of their findings to the Central Committee of the <a href="British%20Archaeological%20Association">British Archaeological Association</a>. Describing the monument as a <a href="Stone%20circles%20in%20the%20British%20Isles%20and%20Brittany">stone circle</a>, they asserted that they discovered <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> pottery at the site, and noted that as well as being called the Coldrum Stones, the monument also had the name of the Adscombe Stones, which Kemble believed originated with the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word for funeral pile, "ad". In August 1863, members of the <a href="Royal%20Archaeological%20Institute">Archaeological Institute</a>—which was holding its week-long meeting in <a href="Rochester%2C%20Kent">Rochester</a>—visited the site, guided by the antiquary <a href="Charles%20Roach%20Smith">Charles Roach Smith</a>. That year, the monument was described in a copy of "Gentleman's Magazine" by Yorkshire antiquary Charles Moore Jessop, who believed it to be a "<a href="Celts">Celtic</a>" stone circle.

In 1869, the antiquarian A. L. Lewis first visited the site, and was informed by locals that several years previously a skull had been uncovered from inside or near to the chamber, but that they believed it to be that of a <a href="Names%20of%20the%20Romani%20people%23Gypsy%20and%20Gipsy">gypsy</a>. A later account elaborated on this, stating that two individuals who excavated in the centre of the chamber without permission discovered a human skeleton, the skull of which was re-buried in the churchyard at <a href="Meopham">Meopham</a>. In an 1878 note published in "<a href="Royal%20Anthropological%20Institute%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland</a>", Lewis noted that while many tourists visited Kit's Coty House, "very few goes to or ever hears of a yet more curious collection of stones at Colderham or Coldrum Lodge". He believed that the monument consisted of both a "chamber" and an "oval" of stones, suggesting that they were "two distinct erections". In 1880, the archaeologist <a href="Flinders%20Petrie">Flinders Petrie</a> included the existence of the stones at "Coldreham" in his list of Kentish earthworks; although noting that a previous commentator had described the stones as being in the shape of an oval, he instead described them as forming "a rectilinear enclosure" around the chamber. He then included a small, basic plan of the monument.

In August 1889, two amateur archaeologists, George Payne and A. A. Arnold, came across the monument, which they noted was known among locals as the "Coldrum Stones" and "Druid Temple"; according to Payne, "the huge stones were so overgrown with brambles and brushwood that they could not be discerned". He returned the next year, noting that the brushwood had since been cut away to reveal the megaliths. In his 1893 book "Collectanea Cantiana", Payne noted that although it had first been described in print in 1844, "since that time no one seems to have taken the trouble to properly record them or make a plan", an unusual claim given that a copy of Petrie's published plan existed in his library. For this reason, after gaining permission from the landowner, he convinced Major A. O. Green, Instructor in Survey at <a href="Brompton%2C%20Kent">Brompton</a>, to conduct a survey of the monument in August 1892. He also wrote to the archaeologist <a href="Augustus%20Pitt-Rivers">Augustus Pitt-Rivers</a>, encouraging him to schedule the Coldrum Stones as a legally protected site under the <a href="Ancient%20Monuments%20Protection%20Act%201882">Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882</a>. Payne described the Coldrum Stones as "the finest monument of its class in the county, and one worthy of every care and attention." Comparing it to other monuments of its type in Britain, he stated that it was undoubtedly "of sepulchral origin, belonging to a period anterior to the Roman domination of Britain." Payne also noted a folk tradition that there were stone avenues connecting Coldrum to the Addington Long Barrow, although added that he was unable to discover any physical evidence of this feature.

In 1904, George Clinch published a note on the Medway Megaliths in the Royal Anthropological Institute's journal, "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20Royal%20Anthropological%20Institute">Man</a>", in which he referred to the Coldrum Stones as "at once the most remarkable and the least known of the whole series." Suggesting that its design indicates that it was built during "a late date in the neolithic age", he compared the workmanship in producing the megaliths to that at Stonehenge, although noted that they differed in that the Coldrum Stones clearly represented "a sepulchral pile". Ultimately, he ended his note by urging for the site to be protected under the <a href="Ancient%20Monuments%20Protection%20Act%201900">Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900</a>. In that same issue, Lewis included an added note in which he rejected the idea that the monument had once been covered by an earthen tumulus because he could see "no evidence that anything of that kind ever existed", and instead he interpreted the site as a stone circle, comparing it to the examples at <a href="Avebury">Avebury</a>, <a href="Arbor%20Low">Arbor Low</a>, and <a href="Stanton%20Drew%20stone%20circles">Stanton Drew</a>, suggesting that the central chamber was a shrine.

The Coldrum Stones have been <a href="excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavated</a> on multiple occasions. On 16 April 1910, the amateur archaeologist F. J. Bennett began excavation at the site, having previously uncovered Neolithic stone tools from Addington Long Barrow. He soon discovered human bones "under only a few inches of chalky soil" at Coldrum. He returned to the site for further excavation in August 1910, this time with his niece and her husband, both of whom were dentists with an interest in <a href="craniology">craniology</a>; on that day they discovered pieces of a human skull, which they were able to largely reconstruct. A few days later he returned to excavate on the north-west corner of the chamber with the architect E. W. Filkins; that day, they found a second skull, further bones, a flint tool, and pieces of pottery. This pottery was later identified as being Anglo-Saxon in date.

Later that month, George Payne and F. W. Reader met with Bennett to discuss his finds. With the aid of two other interested amateur archaeologists, Mr Boyd and Miss Harker, both from <a href="West%20Malling">Malling</a>, excavation resumed in early September. In 2009, the archaeologists Martin Smith and Megan Brickley noted that Bennett's excavations had taken heed of Pitt-Rivers's advice that excavations should be recorded in full. They noted that Bennett had provided "clear plan and section drawings, photographs of the monument and careful attempts to consider site formation processes." Suggesting that the monument was constructed on agricultural land, in his published report Bennett cited the ideas of anthropologist <a href="James%20Frazer">James Frazer</a> in "<a href="The%20Golden%20Bough">The Golden Bough</a>" in proposing that the Coldrum Stones "may at one time have been dedicated, though not necessarily initially so, to the worship of the corn god and of agriculture." He believed that the human remains found at the site were the victims of <a href="human%20sacrifice">human sacrifice</a> killed in fertility rites; conversely, Evans later stated that "we have no means of knowing" whether human sacrifice had taken place at the site.

In September 1922, Filkins again excavated at Coldrum, this time with the aid of <a href="Gravesend">Gravesend</a> resident Charles Gilbert. Their project was financed through grants provided by the British Association and the Society of Antiquaries, with Filkins noting that at the time of its commencement, "a miniature jungle" had grown up around the site which had to be cleared. Excavation continued sporadically until at least 1926. Human remains were discovered, and placed into the possession of Sir Arthur Keith of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons">Royal College of Surgeons</a>, although it is also recorded that at some point between 1939 and 1945 human remains that had been found at the site were reburied in the churchyard at Trottiscliffe. This excavation revealed all the existing sarsens surrounding the monument, several which had previously been buried. The stones of the chamber were shored up with <a href="concrete">concrete</a> foundations where Filkins deemed it necessary. Although Filkins' excavation was comprehensive, it did ignore stone holes, packing stones, and their relationship to the mound. In 1998, Ashbee noted that while from "a present-day perspective, it is possible to see shortcomings [in Filkins' excavation...] in terms of the general standards of the early part of this century, there is much to commend."

In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist <a href="O.%20G.%20S.%20Crawford">O. G. S. Crawford</a>, then working as the archaeological officer for the <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a>, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">The National Trust</a>, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist <a href="Leslie%20Grinsell">Leslie Grinsell</a> expressed the view that "it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for "stunning views from the top of the barrow". John H. Evans characterised the site as "the most impressive" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as "the finest and most complete" of the group.

Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.

Tuck School of Business

The Tuck School of Business (also known as Tuck, and formally known as the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance) is the <a href="Graduate%20school">graduate</a> <a href="business%20school">business school</a> of <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a>, an <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> research university in <a href="Hanover%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Hanover, New Hampshire</a>. Founded in 1900 through a donation made by Dartmouth alumnus <a href="Edward%20Tuck">Edward Tuck</a>, the Tuck School was the first institution in the world to offer a master's degree in business administration.

The Tuck School awards only one degree, the <a href="Master%20of%20Business%20Administration">Master of Business Administration</a> degree, through a full-time, residential program. The school does not offer an <a href="Master%20of%20Business%20Administration%23Executive">Executive MBA</a> or a part-time program, believing that such programs, while lucrative, would dilute the focus of its full-time MBA program.

Tuck does, however, offer an Advanced Management Program for executives, which spans either one or two weeks depending on the course. In addition, Tuck offers a 4-week, intensive summer program to liberal arts students seeking to build a foundation in core business concepts.

Compared to other elite business schools, Tuck is known for its rural setting and small class size — each MBA class consists of about 280 students. As such, both factors, combined with Tuck's commitment to the full-time MBA program attribute to its high giving rate among the 10,300 Tuck alumni across 73 countries. Almost 70% of all Tuck alumni regularly give to the school, the highest rate among business schools worldwide.

The MBA program has held a top-10 ranking in multiple publications, including "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>", "<a href="Bloomberg%20Businessweek">Bloomberg</a>", "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>", "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>", "<a href="Business%20Insider">Business Insider</a>", and "<a href="Vault.com">Vault</a>". According to "U.S. News & World Report", MBA graduates of Tuck earned an average $158,194 first year compensation, the fifth highest of all US-based MBA programs. Tuck's MBA program also ties for 9th place with <a href="MIT%20Sloan%20School%20of%20Management">MIT</a> for the highest average <a href="Graduate%20Management%20Admission%20Test">GMAT</a> score of 722 for its entering class.

The school is one of six <a href="Ivy%20League%20business%20schools">Ivy League business schools</a>, alongside <a href="Wharton%20School%20of%20Business">Wharton</a>, <a href="Harvard%20Business%20School">HBS</a>, <a href="Columbia%20Business%20School">CBS</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Curtis%20Johnson%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Management">Johnson</a>, and <a href="Yale%20School%20of%20Management">Yale SOM</a>.

At the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth College president <a href="William%20Jewett%20Tucker">William Jewett Tucker</a> decided to explore the possibility of establishing a school of business to educate the growing number of Dartmouth alumni entering the commercial world. Additionally, Tucker was concerned about business leadership in a broad social sense, or, as he put it, "training commensurate with the larger meaning of business", and so began soliciting interest among Dartmouth alumni.

Through a renewed friendship, Tucker enlisted the support of his former roommate from his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, <a href="Edward%20Tuck">Edward Tuck</a>, who had since become a wealthy banker and philanthropist. Enthusiastically agreeing to help, on September 8, 1899, Edward Tuck donated an initial grant of $300,000 — in the form of 1,700 shares of <a href="preferred%20stock">preferred stock</a> in the <a href="Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28U.S.%29">Great Northern Railway Company of Minnesota</a> — to found and endow the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance, which was named in memory of Tuck's father and Dartmouth alumnus, <a href="Amos%20Tuck">Amos Tuck</a>. In January 1900, the Dartmouth Board of Trustees passed a vote to formally establish the school.

The new school's tuition fee cost $100 for the few students who enrolled in the first year; graduates of the two-year program received a Master of Commercial Science degree (MCS). The curriculum involved both traditional <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a> fields as well as economic and finance education. Specifically, the first-years were required to take Modern History, Economics, Political Science, Sociology, Foreign Language, and English Composition and Speaking; second-year courses included Modern History and Diplomacy, Finance, Transportation, Insurance, Law, Municipal Administration, Demography and Social Institutions, Language, and Practice Organizations.

Undergraduate Dartmouth professors taught most of the first-year courses at Tuck, while outside guest instructors and business-people, such as an export merchant, an attorney, an insurance company president, and an accountant, educated the second-year students. Edward Tuck, pleased with the breadth of experience found in the school's instructors, wrote to Dartmouth president Tucker in February 1902, "I am glad that it will be the aim of the school to bring students in touch with practical businessmen."

While other business programs tended to offer specialized technical courses linked neither to the liberal arts tradition nor to the broader purposes of business, Tuck maintained itself as a school of general management in the broadest liberal sense, to which a study by the <a href="Carnegie%20Corporation%20of%20New%20York">Carnegie Corporation</a> observed, "The Tuck School probably went further than any other institution in the pre-war period in putting its work on a demanding intellectual level." Thus, the Tuck School's emphasis on a broad education in general management was adopted by many other emerging business schools, and was dubbed the "Tuck Pattern."

Students of the first class held their studies in the Hubbard House, located on North Main Street across the <a href="The%20Green%20%28Dartmouth%20College%29">College Green</a>. A year later, in 1901, Tuck donated an additional $100,000 to build the original Tuck Hall (now McNutt Hall). The school grew and prospered under the leadership of Frank H. Dixon, who served as the school's first secretary and later left to join the Dartmouth economics department full-time in 1904, followed by <a href="Harlow%20S.%20Person">Harlow Person</a>, Tuck's first dean, from 1904 through 1919. Person, in 1911, invited 300 leaders of industry, including <a href="Frederick%20Winslow%20Taylor">Frederick Winslow Taylor</a> — who later became a professor at Tuck — and <a href="Lillian%20Moller%20Gilbreth">Lillian Gilbreth</a>, to a major conference on scientific management, which business historians consider the kick-off for what later became the worldwide <a href="scientific%20management">scientific management</a> movement.

Afterward, the school was led by a Tuck alumnus, William R. Gray, from 1919 through 1937. During this period of growth, Dartmouth president <a href="Ernest%20Martin%20Hopkins">Ernest Martin Hopkins</a> wrote often to <a href="Edward%20Tuck">Edward Tuck</a> reflecting on the school's flourishing alumni and faculty. In the late 1920s, Hopkins sought to unify the Tuck School by establishing a central campus, uniting the school's academic and residential facilities. In order to do so, however, Hopkins had to receive permission to do so from Edward Tuck, as the documents of incorporation stipulated that the original Tuck Hall be used exclusively for a business school. Hopkins wrote to Tuck in July 1928, then 85 years old and living in France, outlining his reasons for the proposed move and asking permission to release Dartmouth from the stipulation regarding the use of the original Tuck Hall.

Edward Tuck, going above merely granting his permission, wrote back in August 1928, "The success and growth of the school have gone far beyond our original expectations, and we have every reason to be proud of it. It would be a satisfaction to me to do it [that is, donate the funds] if I could, rather than have outside capital contribute to a work which thus far I have taken care of financially myself."

Tuck donated 600 shares of <a href="Chase%20Bank%23Chase%20National%20Bank">Chase National Bank</a>, which was sold for $567,766 a couple months before the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">Black Tuesday</a> crash at the start of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. On the west side of the campus, Edward Tuck Hall was completed in 1930 and was flanked by two dormitories, Chase Hall and Woodbury Hall — named for two Dartmouth alumni, <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a> and <a href="Levi%20Woodbury">Levi Woodbury</a>, respectively. Stell Hall, the dining facility adjacent to Chase Hall, was named after Tuck's wife, Julia Stell. With the completion of the project, Tuck students now lived together and took classes together.

In 1937, Herluf V. Olsen succeeded Gray as the dean of Tuck and led the school until 1951. During his tenure, Olsen created the joint Tuck-<a href="Thayer%20School%20of%20Engineering">Thayer</a> program between the business school and engineering school. In 1942, the school's name changed to the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, and under Dean Arthur P. Upgren's leadership, who ran Tuck from 1952 to 1957, the degree program changed from the MCS to the modern <a href="Master%20of%20Business%20Administration">Master of Business Administration</a> (MBA) in 1953.

Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tuck School catered primarily to Dartmouth students, accepting undergraduates during their third year. Such students made up 90 percent of each class at Tuck. Under Dean Karl Hill, who led the school from 1957 to 1968, Tuck shifted its focus to soliciting a national student body to create a more diverse student body. In addition, Hill created the Tuck Associates program in 1964 to foster relationships between Tuck and the business community. By securing grants from the <a href="Alfred%20P.%20Sloan%20Foundation">Sloan Foundation</a>, Hill also brought in additional faculty to the school by setting up funding for summer research.

The expansion under Hill culminated in the creation of the school's board of overseers as well as a full-time admissions office in the early 1960s. The resulting expansion in the late 1960s saw additional growth of the campus with the construction of a new dormitory and, through a generous donation made by Thomas G. Murdough, founder of <a href="Little%20Tikes">Little Tikes</a>, the Murdough Center, which contains the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library.

<a href="John%20W.%20Hennessey%20Jr">John Hennessey</a>, who succeeded Hill as dean in 1968, continued to revamp the curriculum and recruit new faculty members. The <a href="Ford%20Foundation">Ford Foundation's</a> Gorden-Howell report and <a href="Carnegie%20Corporation">Carnegie Corporation's</a> Pierson report both singled out the Tuck School as having a serious academic curriculum, including newly emerging disciplines in quantitative and behavioral sciences, as well as organizational behavior and business policy.

Perhaps Hennessey's most significant changes were his efforts to recruit minority students for the Tuck program. He served as the founding chairman of the Council for Opportunity in Graduate Management Education and visited dozens of schools to recruit minority students to Tuck. In 1964, Tuck admitted its first minority student and, in 1968, its first woman student.

In 1971, Hennessey established the Tuck Annual Giving program, which, in its first year, drew $71,000 from the 27 percent of alumni who donated. In the same year, "Tuck Today", the school's alumni magazine was founded. By 1972, Tuck alumni clubs were established in major cities across the country, which helped establish Tuck's role in Dartmouth's first capital campaign. Hennessey also oversaw the founding of the Tuck Executive Program in 1974 alongside professor Kenneth Davis.

Under Deans Richard West, who served from 1976 to 1983, and Colin Blaydon (1983–1990), the school's curriculum and faculty expanded extensively, and applications increased by one-third. Since the late 1980s, Tuck has continued to expand in student body and faculty size, and has seen the establishment of two new campus buildings as well as several research centers and non-degree business programs.

The Tuck School is located on the campus of <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a>, which is situated in the rural, <a href="Upper%20Valley%20%28Connecticut%20River%29">Upper Valley</a> <a href="New%20England">New England</a> town of <a href="Hanover%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Hanover, New Hampshire</a>. The campus of the Tuck School sits in a complex on the west side of Dartmouth's campus, near the <a href="Connecticut%20River">Connecticut River</a>. Shortly after being founded in 1900, Tuck was housed in a single building across from <a href="The%20Green%20%28Dartmouth%20College%29">the Green</a> at the center of the campus; in 1930, the institution moved into Stell, Chase, Tuck, and Woodbury Halls in its present location along the Tuck Mall. Today, these original structures serve as four of Tuck's six academic and administrative buildings.

Tuck emphasizes its residential character, describing residential life as "a foundation of the Tuck culture" and crediting it as "a reason that Tuck alumni are among the most loyal of all the business school [sic] in the world." Tuck's isolated location has been described as an "image problem" for attracting successful applicants and faculty to its rural campus, although some students cite the insular location as a positive trait for fostering intimacy and friendship.

Currently, Tuck has five residential facilities: Buchanan Hall (constructed 1968) and Whittemore Hall (constructed 2000) Pineau-Valencienne Hall, Achtmeyer Hall and Raether Hall (2008). Further, a new complex called the Tuck Living and Learning Complex that houses 95 additional students as well as classrooms and study space serves as the home for nearly half of first-year Tuck students. This state-of-the-art facility was constructed in 2008 for around $27.2 million. The Tuck School shares the Murdough Center (containing the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library) with the adjacent <a href="Thayer%20School%20of%20Engineering">Thayer School of Engineering</a>. The Tuck campus is serviced by Byrne Hall, a dining facility operated by Dartmouth Dining Services.

The Tuck School offers only a single degree: the two-year, full-time <a href="Master%20of%20Business%20Administration">Master of Business Administration</a> (MBA). Students may specialize within the MBA in fields such as finance or marketing, but a specialization is not required for graduation. First-year MBA students at Tuck undertake a 32-week core curriculum in general management and a specialized First Year Project. During their second year, students take 12 elective courses and design their own focused field of study.

The school stresses a collaborative and teamwork-based approach to learning, which it touts as one of its assets for "building the interpersonal skills required for business leadership." However, this emphasis on cooperative group learning has been criticized as too "touchy-feely" for students entering the competitive business world, and the emphasis on consensus-building as detrimental to students' ability to make quick, independent decisions.

Students seeking other degrees can engage in one of seven dual-degree or joint-degree programs offered in conjunction with other academic institutions. Dual degrees include an MBA/Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy from <a href="The%20Fletcher%20School%20of%20Law%20and%20Diplomacy">The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy</a> at <a href="Tufts%20University">Tufts University</a>, an MBA/<a href="Master%20of%20Public%20Policy">Master of Public Policy</a> from the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20School%20of%20Government">John F.

The school also offers a variety of second-year exchange programs at other institutions such as the <a href="Handelshochschule%20Leipzig">Handelshochschule Leipzig</a> in Germany, the <a href="HEC%20School%20of%20Management">HEC School of Management</a> in Paris, <a href="IESE">IESE Business School</a> in Barcelona, and the <a href="London%20Business%20School">London Business School</a>.

In addition to the MBA program, the school also offers an array of executive education and other non-degree programs, such as the Tuck Business Bridge Program for current and recent university undergraduates, and the Leadership Education and Development (LEAD) program for high school students.

95% of the Tuck MBA class of 2017 had jobs offers three months post graduation and 100% of those students found internships during the summer following the first year. The most popular career industries for graduates are <a href="management%20consulting">management consulting</a> (33%), financial services (20%), and technology (20%) with graduates' first year annual base salaries averaging $127,986 with a mean signing bonus of $30,208. According to the 2018 Financial Times M.B.A. report, Tuck currently ranks 10th in the world for average three year post-graduation salary at $172,735. This figure does not including bonuses or other forms of compensation.

According to Tuck's published 2017 employment report, the top hiring companies for full time students in the class of 2016 were <a href="McKinsey%20%26amp%3B%20Company">McKinsey & Company</a> (21), <a href="Bain%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Bain & Company</a> (18), and <a href="Amazon%20%28company%29">Amazon</a> (11). Similarly, the top hiring companies for the class of 2017 internships were McKinsey & Company (16), Bain & Company (11), and Amazon (10)

Like the undergraduate portion of Dartmouth College, the Tuck School operates on a <a href="Academic%20term">quarter system</a>. As part of the larger institution, the Tuck School is ultimately administered by Dartmouth's President and <a href="Board%20of%20Trustees%20of%20Dartmouth%20College">Board of Trustees</a>. The school is directly managed by a Dean (currently Matthew Slaughter) who is advised by a Board of Overseers that was established in 1951.

Since the Tuck School offers only one degree, it does not contain formal academic departments as do other institutions. Instead, faculty are generally grouped in one or more of seven "academic areas": <a href="accounting">accounting</a>, <a href="finance">finance</a> and <a href="economics">economics</a>, <a href="marketing">marketing</a>, <a href="operations%20management">operations management</a> and <a href="management%20science">management science</a>, strategy and management, <a href="international%20business">international business</a>, and management communication. Tuck is also home to five research centers which organize research in different fields of business administration. The centers are meant to promote faculty research, establish liaisons between the Tuck School and the corporate world, and sponsor programs for Tuck as a whole; MBA students are occasionally invited to participate as fellows and research associates. The five research centers are the William F. Achtmeyer Center for Global Leadership, the Center for Corporate Governance, the Center for International Business, the Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship, and the Glassmeyer/McNamee Center for Digital Strategies.

Tuck students, known as "Tuckies", typically number about 560 students in total — 280 per class — with international students making up about 37% of the student body. The school has a high percentage of women (44% vs. <a href="Harvard%20Business%20School">Harvard's</a> 41% and <a href="Columbia%20Business%20School">Columbia's</a> 41%) and has been recognized as having "the best representation of women among top-tier M.B.A. programs" alongside <a href="Wharton%20School%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Pennsylvania">Wharton's</a> MBA program. This marks an 11% increase in female representation at Tuck from 2013. 23% of Tuck's student body are domestic U.S. minorities, a relatively average figure when compared to <a href="Harvard%20Business%20School">HBS</a> (28%) and <a href="MIT%20Sloan%20School%20of%20Management">MIT Sloan</a> (15%). Tuck has addressed previous diversity shortcomings by offering additional scholarships to minority applicants and by promoting such programs as the annual Tuck Diversity Conference and participation in the Forté Foundation for women in business.

Like many other business schools, Tuck encourages its students to have post-undergraduate work experience before applying to the MBA program. The average incoming student has five years of full-time work experience, and the average student age is 28, ranging from 25 to 32 years.

Tuck reports that they have approximately 10,300 living alumni living across 74 different countries. Tuck also claims the highest percentage of alumni donors of any business school in the world at about a 70% giving rate among its alumni. 2017 was the eleventh consecutive year in which greater than two thirds of all alumni have contributed to the school.

Pather Panchali

Pather Panchali ( "", "Song of the Little Road") is a 1955 Indian <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali-language</a> <a href="Drama%20%28modern%20genre%29">drama film</a> written and directed by <a href="Satyajit%20Ray">Satyajit Ray</a> and produced by the <a href="Government%20of%20West%20Bengal">Government of West Bengal</a>. It is based on <a href="Bibhutibhushan%20Bandyopadhyay">Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay</a>'s 1929 Bengali <a href="Pather%20Panchali%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a> and is Ray's directorial debut. It features <a href="Subir%20Banerjee">Subir Banerjee</a>, <a href="Kanu%20Banerjee">Kanu Banerjee</a>, <a href="Karuna%20Banerjee">Karuna Banerjee</a>, Uma Dasgupta and <a href="Chunibala%20Devi">Chunibala Devi</a>. The first film in the <a href="Apu%20trilogy">Apu trilogy</a>, "Pather Panchali" depicts the childhood of the protagonist Apu (Subir Banerjee) and his elder sister Durga (Uma Dasgupta) and the harsh village life of their poor family.

Production was interrupted because of funding problems and it took nearly three years for the film to be completed. The film was shot mainly <a href="location%20shooting">on location</a>, had a <a href="Low-budget%20film">limited budget</a>, featured mostly amateur actors, and was made by an inexperienced crew. The <a href="sitar">sitar</a> player <a href="Ravi%20Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a> composed the film's soundtrack and score using classical Indian <a href="raga">raga</a>s. <a href="Subrata%20Mitra">Subrata Mitra</a> was in charge of the cinematography while editing was handled by <a href="Dulal%20Dutta">Dulal Dutta</a>. Following its premiere on 3 May 1955 during an exhibition at New York's <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>, "Pather Panchali" was released in Calcutta later the same year to an enthusiastic reception. A special screening was attended by the Chief Minister of West Bengal and the Prime Minister of India. Critics have praised its realism, humanity, and soul-stirring qualities while others have called its slow pace a drawback, and some have condemned it for romanticising poverty. Scholars have commented on the film's <a href="wikt%3Alyrical">lyrical</a> quality and <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">realism</a> (influenced by <a href="Italian%20neorealism">Italian neorealism</a>), its portrayal of the poverty and small delights of daily life, and the use of what the author Darius Cooper has termed the "epiphany of wonder", among other themes.

The tale of Apu's life is continued in the two subsequent installments of Ray's trilogy: "<a href="Aparajito">Aparajito</a>" ("The Unvanquished", 1956) and "<a href="Apur%20Sansar">Apur Sansar</a>" ("The World of Apu", 1959). "Pather Panchali" is described as a turning point in Indian cinema, as it was among the films that pioneered the <a href="Parallel%20Cinema">Parallel Cinema</a> movement, which espoused authenticity and social realism. The first film from independent India to attract major international critical attention, it won India's <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Feature%20Film">National Film Award for Best Feature Film</a> in 1955, the Best Human Document award at the <a href="1956%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">1956 Cannes Film Festival</a>, and several other awards, establishing Ray as one of the country's most distinguished filmmakers. It is often featured in <a href="List%20of%20films%20considered%20the%20best">lists of the greatest films ever made</a>.

In Nischindipur, rural <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>, in the 1910s, Harihar Roy (<a href="Kanu%20Banerjee">Kanu Banerjee</a>) earns a meagre living as a "<a href="pujari">pujari</a>" (priest), but dreams of a better career as a poet and playwright. His wife Sarbajaya (<a href="Karuna%20Banerjee">Karuna Banerjee</a>) takes care of their children, Durga (Uma Dasgupta) and Apu (<a href="Subir%20Banerjee">Subir Banerjee</a>), and Harihar's elderly cousin, Indir Thakrun (<a href="Chunibala%20Devi">Chunibala Devi</a>). Because of their limited resources, Sarbajaya resents having to share her home with the old Indir, who often steals food from their already bare kitchen. At times, Sarbajaya's taunts become offensive, forcing Indir to take temporary refuge in the home of another relative. Durga is fond of Indir and often gives her fruit she has stolen from a wealthy neighbour's orchard. One day, the neighbour's wife accuses Durga of stealing a bead necklace (which Durga denies) and blames Sarbajaya for encouraging her tendency to steal.

As the elder sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no opportunity to tease him. Together, they share the simple joys of life: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's <a href="Bioscope%20show">bioscope</a>, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a "<a href="Jatra%20%28theatre%29">jatra</a>" (folk theatre) performed by a troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted by the sound of a distant train's whistle. One day, they run away from home to catch a glimpse of the train, only to discover Indir sitting dead on their return.

Unable to earn a good living in the village, Harihar travels to the city to seek a better job. He promises Sarbajaya that he will return with money to repair their dilapidated house. During his absence, the family sinks deeper into poverty. Sarbajaya grows increasingly lonely and bitter. One day during the <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> season, Durga plays in the downpour for too long, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Adequate medical care being unavailable, the fever becomes worse, and on a night of incessant rain and gusty winds, she dies. Harihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise he has brought from the city. Sarbajaya, who remains silent, breaks down at the feet of her husband, and Harihar cries out in grief as he discovers that he has lost his daughter. The family decide to leave their ancestral home. As they start packing, Apu finds the necklace that Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart.


<a href="Bibhutibhushan%20Bandopadhyay">Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay</a>'s novel "<a href="Pather%20Panchali%20%28novel%29">Pather Panchali</a>" is a classic <a href="bildungsroman">bildungsroman</a> (a type of <a href="coming-of-age%20story">coming-of-age story</a>) in the canon of <a href="Bengali%20literature">Bengali literature</a>. It first appeared as a <a href="serial%20%28literature%29">serial</a> in a Calcutta periodical in 1928, and was published as a book the next year. The novel depicts a poor family's struggle to survive in their rural ancestral home and the growing up of Apu, the son of the family. The later part of the novel, where Apu and his parents leave their village and settle in <a href="Benaras">Benaras</a>, formed the basis of "<a href="Aparajito">Aparajito</a>" ("The Unvanquished", 1956), the second film of the Apu trilogy.

<a href="Satyajit%20Ray">Satyajit Ray</a>, working as a graphic designer for <a href="Signet%20Press">Signet Press</a>, created the illustrations for a new abridged edition of the book in 1944. At that time, Ray read the unabridged novel; Signet's owner D. K. Gupta told Ray that the abridged version would make a great film. The idea appealed to Ray, and around 1946–47, when he considered making a film, he turned to "Pather Panchali" because of certain qualities that "made it a great book: its humanism, its lyricism, and its ring of truth". The author's widow permitted Ray to make a film based on the novel; the agreement was in principle only, and no financial arrangement was made.

The <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali</a> word "path" literally means path, and "pather" means "of the path". The word "panchali" refers to a type of narrative folk song that used to be performed in Bengal and was the forerunner of another type of folk performance, the "<a href="Jatra%20%28Bengal%29">jatra</a>". English translations of the Bengali title include "Song of the Little Road", "The Lament of the Path", "Song of the Road", and "Song of the Open Road".

"Pather Panchali" did not have a script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray completed the first draft of the notes during his sea voyage to and from London in 1950. Before <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a> began, he created a <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a> dealing with details and continuity. Years later, he donated those drawings and notes to <a href="Cin%C3%A9math%C3%A8que%20Fran%C3%A7aise">Cinémathèque Française</a>.

In <a href="Apur%20Panchali">Apur Panchali</a> (the Bengali translation of "", 1994), Ray wrote that he had omitted many of the novel's characters and that he had rearranged some of its sequences to make the narrative better as cinema. Changes include Indir's death, which occurs early in the novel at a village shrine in the presence of adults, while in the film Apu and Durga find her corpse in the open. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not in the novel, in which neither child sees the train, although they try. Durga's fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained in the novel. The ending of the film—the family's departure from the village—is not the end of the novel.

Ray tried to extract a simple theme from the random sequences of significant and trivial episodes of the "Pather Panchali" novel, while preserving what <a href="W.%20Andrew%20Robinson">W. Andrew Robinson</a> describes as the "loitering impression" it creates. According to Ray, "the script had to retain some of the rambling quality of the novel because that in itself contained a clue to the feel of authenticity: life in a poor Bengali village does ramble." For Robinson, Ray's adaptation focuses mainly on Apu and his family, while Bandopadhyay's original featured greater detail about village life in general.

Kanu Banerjee (who plays Harihar) was an established <a href="Cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal">Bengali film</a> actor. Karuna Banerjee (Sarbajaya) was an amateur actress from the <a href="Indian%20People%27s%20Theatre%20Association">Indian People's Theatre Association</a>, and the wife of Ray's friend. Uma Dasgupta, who successfully auditioned for the part of Durga, also had prior theatre experience.

For the role of Apu, Ray advertised in newspapers for boys of ages five to seven. None of the candidates who auditioned fulfilled Ray's expectations, but his wife spotted a boy in their neighbourhood, and this boy, Subir Banerjee, was cast as Apu. (The surname of three of the main actors happened to be <a href="Banerjee">Banerjee</a>, but they were not related to each other). The hardest role to fill was the wizened old Indir. Ray eventually found Chunibala Devi, a retired stage actress living in one of Calcutta's <a href="red-light%20district">red-light district</a>s, as the ideal candidate. Several minor roles were played by the villagers of <a href="Garia">Boral</a>, where "Pather Panchali" was filmed.

Shooting started on 27 October 1952. Boral, a village near <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, was selected in early 1953 as the main location for principal photography, and night scenes were shot in-studio. The technical team included several first-timers, including Ray himself and cinematographer <a href="Subrata%20Mitra">Subrata Mitra</a>, who had never operated a film camera. Art director <a href="Bansi%20Chandragupta">Bansi Chandragupta</a> had professional experience, having worked with Jean Renoir on "The River". Both Mitra and Chandragupta went on to establish themselves as respected professionals.

Mitra had met Ray on the set of "The River", where Mitra was allowed to observe the production, take photographs and make notes about lighting for personal reference. Having become friends, Mitra kept Ray informed about the production and showed his photographs. Ray was impressed enough by them to promise him an assistant's position on "Pather Panchali", and when production neared, invited him to shoot the film. As the 21-year-old Mitra had no prior filmmaking experience, the choice was met with scepticism by those who knew of the production. Mitra himself later speculated that Ray was nervous about working with an established crew.

Funding was a problem from the outset. No producer was willing to finance the film, as it lacked stars, songs and action scenes. On learning of Ray's plan, one producer, Mr Bhattacharya of Kalpana Movies, contacted Bandopadhyay's widow to request the filming rights and get the film made by <a href="Debaki%20Bose">Debaki Bose</a>, a well-established director. The widow declined as she had already permitted Ray to make the film. The estimated budget for the production was 70,000 (about US$14,613 in 1955). One producer, Rana Dutta, gave money to continue shooting, but had to stop after some of his films flopped.

Ray thus had to borrow money to shoot enough footage to persuade prospective producers to finance the whole film. To raise funds, he continued to work as a graphic designer, pawned his life insurance policy and sold his collection of gramophone records. Production manager Anil Chowdhury convinced Ray's wife, Bijoya, to pawn her jewels. Ray still ran out of money partway through filming, which had to be suspended for nearly a year. Thereafter shooting was done only in intermittent bursts. Ray later admitted that the delays had made him tense and that three miracles saved the film: "One, Apu's voice did not break. Two, Durga did not grow up. Three, Indir Thakrun did not die."

<a href="Bidhan%20Chandra%20Roy">Bidhan Chandra Roy</a>, the <a href="Chief%20Minister%20of%20West%20Bengal">Chief Minister of West Bengal</a>, was requested by an influential friend of Ray's mother to help the production. The Chief Minister obliged, and government officials saw the footage. The Home Publicity Department of the <a href="West%20Bengal%20government">West Bengal government</a> assessed the cost of backing the film and sanctioned a loan, given in installments, allowing Ray to finish production. The government misunderstood the nature of the film, believing it to be a documentary for rural uplift, and recorded the loan as being for "roads improvement", a reference to the film's title.

<a href="Monroe%20Wheeler">Monroe Wheeler</a>, head of the department of exhibitions and publications at New York's <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> (MoMA), who was in Calcutta in 1954, heard about the project and met Ray. He considered the incomplete footage to be of very high quality and encouraged Ray to finish the film so that it could be shown at a MoMA exhibition the following year. Six months later, American director <a href="John%20Huston">John Huston</a> visited India for some early <a href="location%20scouting">location scouting</a> for "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Would%20Be%20King%20%28film%29">The Man Who Would Be King</a>" (eventually made in 1975). Wheeler had asked Huston to check the progress of Ray's project. Huston saw excerpts of the unfinished film and recognised "the work of a great film-maker". Because of Huston's positive feedback, MoMA helped Ray with additional money.

Including the delays and hiatuses in production, it took three years to complete the shooting of "Pather Panchali".

The realist narrative style of "Pather Panchali" was influenced by <a href="Italian%20neorealism">Italian neorealism</a> and the works of French director <a href="Jean%20Renoir">Jean Renoir</a>. In 1949 Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film "<a href="The%20River%20%281951%20film%29">The River</a>" (1951). Ray, a founding member of the <a href="Calcutta%20Film%20Society">Calcutta Film Society</a> (established in 1947), helped him scout for locations in the countryside. When Ray told him about his longstanding wish to film "Pather Panchali", Renoir encouraged him to proceed. In 1950 Ray was sent to London by his employer, the advertising agency D.J. Keymer, to work at their headquarters. During his six months in London, he watched about 100 films. Among these, <a href="Vittorio%20De%20Sica">Vittorio De Sica</a>'s neorealist film "<a href="Bicycle%20Thieves">Bicycle Thieves</a>" (1948) had a profound impact on him. In a 1982 lecture, Ray said that he had come out of the theatre determined to become a filmmaker. The film made him believe that it was possible to make realistic cinema that was <a href="location%20shooting">shot on location</a> with an amateur cast.

The international success of <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>'s "<a href="Rashomon%20%28film%29">Rashomon</a>" (1950) and <a href="Bimal%20Roy">Bimal Roy</a>'s 1953 film "<a href="Do%20Bigha%20Zamin">Do Bigha Zamin</a>" (which was shot partly on location and was about a peasant family) led Ray to believe that "Pather Panchali" would find an international audience. Ray also had more indigenous influences, such as Bengali literature and the native <a href="Theatre%20of%20India">Indian theatrical tradition</a>, particularly the "<a href="Rasa%20%28aesthetics%29">rasa</a>" theory of classical <a href="Sanskrit%20drama">Sanskrit drama</a>. Darius Cooper describes the complicated doctrine of "rasa" as " predominantly on feelings experienced not only by the characters but also conveyed in a certain artistic way to the spectator".

The soundtrack of the film was composed by the <a href="sitar">sitar</a> player <a href="Ravi%20Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a>, who was at an early stage of his career, having debuted in 1939. The background scores feature pieces based on several <a href="raga">raga</a>s of <a href="Indian%20classical%20music">Indian classical music</a>, played mostly on the sitar. The soundtrack, described in a 1995 issue of "The Village Voice" as "at once plaintive and exhilarating", is featured in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s 2007 list of 50 greatest film soundtracks. It has also been cited as an influence on <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>, specifically <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>.

Shankar saw about half the film in a roughly edited version before composing the background score, but he was already familiar with the story. According to Robinson, when Ray met Shankar the latter hummed a tune that was folk-based but had "a certain sophistication". This tune, usually played on a bamboo flute, became the main theme for the film. The majority of the score was composed within the duration of a single night, in a session that lasted for about eleven hours. Shankar also composed two solo sitar pieces—one based on the raga "<a href="Desh%20%28raga%29">Desh</a>" (traditionally associated with rain), and one sombre piece based on the raga "<a href="Todi%20%28raga%29">Todi</a>". He created a piece based on the raga "<a href="Patdeep">Patdeep</a>", played on the <a href="tar%20shehnai">tar shehnai</a>, to accompany the scene in which Harihar learns of Durga's death. The film's cinematographer, Subrata Mitra, performed on the sitar for parts of the soundtrack.

Ray and his crew worked long hours on <a href="post-production">post-production</a>, managing to submit it just in time for Museum of Modern Art's "Textiles and Ornamental Arts of India" exhibition of May 1955. The film, billed as "The Story of Apu and Durga", lacked subtitles. It was one of a series of six evening performances at MoMA, including the US debut of <a href="sarod">sarod</a> player <a href="Ali%20Akbar%20Khan">Ali Akbar Khan</a> and the classical dancer <a href="Shanta%20Rao">Shanta Rao</a>. "Pather Panchali"s MoMA opening on 3 May was well received. Subsequently, the film had its domestic premiere at the annual meeting of the Advertising Club of Calcutta; the response there was not positive, and Ray felt "extremely discouraged". Before its theatrical release in Calcutta, Ray designed large posters, including a neon sign showing Apu and Durga running, which was strategically placed in a busy location in the city. "Pather Panchali" was released in a Calcutta cinema on 26 August 1955 and received a poor initial response. But because of word of mouth, the screenings started filling up within a week or two. It opened again at another cinema, where it ran for seven weeks. A delay in subtitling led to the postponement of the UK release until December 1957. It went on to achieve great success in the US in 1958, running for eight months at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse in New York. The Bengali government earned a profit of $50,000 from its initial US release, and decades later the film grossed $402,723 from its 2015 limited release. The film reportedly grossed an estimated in total at the worldwide box office.

In India the film's reception was enthusiastic. "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" wrote, "It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema ... "Pather Panchali" is pure cinema". Chief Minister Roy arranged a special screening in Calcutta for Prime Minister <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, who came out of the theatre impressed. Despite opposition from some within the governments of West Bengal and India because of its depiction of poverty, "Pather Panchali" was sent to the <a href="1956%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">1956 Cannes Film Festival</a> with Nehru's personal approval. It was screened towards the end of the festival, coinciding with a party given by the Japanese delegation, and only a small number of critics attended. Although some were initially unenthusiastic at the prospect of yet another Indian <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>, the film critic <a href="Arturo%20Lanocita">Arturo Lanocita</a> found "the magic horse of poetry ... invading the screen". "Pather Panchali" was subsequently named Best Human Document at the festival.

<a href="Lindsay%20Anderson">Lindsay Anderson</a> commented after the Cannes screening that "Pather Panchali" had "the quality of ultimate unforgettable experience". In subsequent years, critics have given positive reviews. A 1958 review in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" described "Pather Panchali" as "perhaps the finest piece of filmed folklore since <a href="Robert%20Flaherty">Robert Flaherty</a>'s "<a href="Nanook%20of%20the%20North">Nanook of the North</a>"". In her 1982 book "<a href="5001%20Nights%20at%20the%20Movies">5001 Nights at the Movies</a>", <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a> wrote, "Beautiful, sometimes funny, and full of love, it brought a new vision of India to the screen". <a href="Basil%20Wright">Basil Wright</a> considered it "a new and incontrovertible work of art". <a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> wrote in 1996 that the film "touches the souls and minds of viewers, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers". In 2006 <a href="Philip%20French">Philip French</a> of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" called it "one of the greatest pictures ever made". Twenty years after the release of "Pather Panchali", Akira Kurosawa summarised the effect of the film as overwhelming and lauded its ability "to stir up deep passions".

The reaction was not uniformly positive. On seeing the film, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a> is reported to have said, "I don't want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands." <a href="Bosley%20Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a>, the most influential critic of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", wrote in 1958, "Any picture as loose in structure or as listless in tempo as this one is would barely pass as a 'rough cut' with the editors in Hollywood", even though he praised its gradually emerging poignancy and poetic quality. "<a href="The%20Harvard%20Crimson">The Harvard Crimson</a>" argued in 1959 that its fragmentary nature "contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention. For "Pather Panchali", remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through." Early in the 1980s, Ray was criticised by <a href="Nargis%20Dutt">Nargis Dutt</a>, parliamentarian and former actress, for "exporting poverty". Darius Cooper writes that while many critics celebrated the Apu trilogy "as a eulogy of <a href="Third%20World">third-world</a> culture, others criticized it for what they took to be its romanticization of such a culture".

As of October 2017, the film has a 98% fresh rating on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on an aggregate of 42 reviews with an average score of 9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A film that requires and rewards patience in equal measure, "Pather Panchali" finds director Satyajit Ray delivering a classic with his debut." In 2018 the film earned the 15th spot when BBC released the top 100 foreign language films ever.

In the 1990s, <a href="Merchant%20Ivory%20Productions">Merchant Ivory Productions</a>, with assistance from the <a href="Academy%20Film%20Archive">Academy Film Archive</a> and <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Classics">Sony Pictures Classics</a>, undertook a project to restore the prints. The restored prints, along with several other Ray films, were released in select US theatres. "Pather Panchali" is available in DVD in Region 2 (<a href="DVD%20region%20code">DVD region code</a>) <a href="Phase%20Alternating%20Line">PAL</a> and Region 1 <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> formats. <a href="Artificial%20Eye%20%28distribution%29">Artificial Eye Entertainment</a> is the distributor of Region 2 while <a href="Columbia%20Tri-Star">Columbia Tri-Star</a> is the distributor of Region 1 format.

In 2013, the video distribution company <a href="The%20Criterion%20Collection">The Criterion Collection</a>, in collaboration with the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a>’ Film <a href="Academy%20Film%20Archive">Archive</a>, began the restoration of the original negatives of the Apu trilogy, including "Pather Panchali". These negatives had been severely damaged by a fire in London in 1993, and all film cans and fragments belonging to the Ray films were sent to the Motion Picture Academy for storage, where they lay unseen for two decades. It was discovered upon reexamination that, although many parts of the films were indeed destroyed by fire or the effects of age, other parts were salvageable. The materials were shipped to a restoration laboratory in Bologna, Italy: L’Immagine Ritrovata. Over a thousand hours of labor by hand were expended in restoring and scanning the negatives and, in the end, about 40 percent of the "Pather Panchali" negative was restored. (For those parts of the negative that were missing or unusable, duplicate negatives and fine-grain masters from various commercial or archival sources were used.) The Criterion Collection’s own lab then spent six months creating the digital version of all three films, at times choosing to preserve the distinctive look of the films even at the cost of retaining some imperfections.

On 4 May 2015, the restored "Pather Panchali" premiered at the Museum of Modern Art, a little more than 60 years to the day after the film’s world premiere at the same venue. Several days later, all three films opened at New York’s <a href="Film%20Forum">Film Forum</a>, where they were originally scheduled to run for three weeks. Because of overwhelming public demand – with one writer commenting that "audiences can’t seem to get enough" – the films were held over at that theater until June 30. The trilogy was then sent to be exhibited in many other cities throughout the U.S. and Canada. The restoration work was widely acclaimed, with commentators calling the look of the restored films "gorgeous", "pristine" and “incredible”.

In his 1958 "New York Times" review, Crowther writes that "Pather Panchali" delicately illustrates how "poverty does not always nullify love" and how even very poor people can enjoy the little pleasures of their world. Marie Seton describes how the film intersperses the depiction of poverty and the delights and pleasures of youth. She represents the bond between Durga and Indir, and their fate, as signifying a philosophical core: that both the young and the old die. Seton writes of the film's "lyrical" qualities, noting especially the imagery immediately before the onset of monsoon. Robinson writes about a peculiar quality of "lyrical happiness" in the film, and states that "Pather Panchali" is "about unsophisticated people shot through with great sophistication, and without a trace of condescension or inflated sentiment".

Darius Cooper discusses the use of different "rasa" in the film, observing Apu's repeated "epiphany of wonder", brought about not only by what the boy sees around him, but also when he uses his imagination to create another world. For Cooper, the immersive experience of the film corresponds to this epiphany of wonder. Stephen Teo uses the scene in which Apu and Durga discover railway tracks as an example of the gradual build-up of epiphany and the resulting immersive experience.

Sharmishtha Gooptu discusses the idea that the idyllic village life portrayed in "Pather Panchali" represents authentic Bengali village life, which disappeared during the upheavals of <a href="Partition%20of%20India">Partition</a> in 1947. She suggests that the film seeks to connect an idealised, pre-partition past with the actual present of partitioned Bengal, and that it uses prototypes of rural Bengal to construct an image of the ideal village. In contrast to this idealism, Mitali Pati and Suranjan Ganguly point out how Ray used eye-level shots, natural lighting, long takes and other techniques to achieve realism. Mainak Biswas has written that "Pather Panchali" comes very close to the concept of Italian neorealism, as it has several passages with no dramatic development, even though the usual realities of life, such as the changing of seasons or the passing of a day, are concretely filmed.

"Pather Panchali" has won many national and international awards. At India's <a href="3rd%20National%20Film%20Awards">3rd National Film Awards</a> in 1955, it was named <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Feature%20Film">Best Feature Film</a> and <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Feature%20Film%20in%20Bengali">Best Bengali Feature Film</a>. The next year, it competed for the <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a> at Cannes, where it won Best Human Document and an OCIC Award – Special Mention. More awards from film festivals across the world followed: the Vatican Award (Rome), the Golden Carbao (Manila), and the Diploma of Merit (<a href="Edinburgh%20International%20Film%20Festival">Edinburgh</a>) in 1956; the Selznick Golden Laurel for Best Film (<a href="Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival">Berlin</a>), the Golden Gate for Best Director and Best Picture (<a href="San%20Francisco%20International%20Film%20Festival">San Francisco</a>) in 1957; Best Film (<a href="Vancouver%20International%20Film%20Festival">Vancouver</a>), and the Critics' Award for Best Film (Stratford) in 1958. It also won several awards for best foreign-language film: at the <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review%20Awards%201958">National Board of Review Awards 1958</a>; at the Afro Arts Theater, New York, 1959; the Kinema Jumpo Award in Japan, 1966; and the <a href="Bodil%20Award%20for%20Best%20Non-European%20Film">Bodil Award</a> in Denmark, 1969. In 1958 it had been nominated for Best Film at the <a href="11th%20British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">11th British Academy Film Awards</a>.

"<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>", the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s (BFI) magazine, has included "Pather Panchali" several times in its Critics' Polls of the greatest-ever films. In 1962, it ranked 11th; in 1992, 6th; and in 2002, 22nd. The magazine ranked the film 42nd in its 2012 critics' poll of "Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time" and 48th in its 2012 directors' poll. In 1998, in a similar critics' poll from Asian film magazine "<a href="Cinemaya">Cinemaya</a>", "Pather Panchali" was ranked the second-greatest film of all time. "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" ranked the film at number 12 (tied with "<a href="The%20Godfather">The Godfather</a>") in its Top 250 "Best Films of the Century" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics.

"Pather Panchali" was included in various other all-time lists, including <a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">"Time Out"</a>s "Centenary Top One Hundred Films" in 1995, the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" "Hot 100 Films From the Past" in 1997, the "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" "100 Maverick Movies of the Last 100 Years" in 1999, ""The New York Times" Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made" in 2002, the BFI Top Fifty "Must See" Children's Films in 2005, and BFI's "Top 10 Indian Films" of all time. It was included in <a href="NDTV">NDTV</a>'s list of "India's 20 greatest films", and in 2013 in <a href="CNN-IBN">CNN-IBN</a>'s list of "100 greatest Indian films of all time". The Apu trilogy as a whole was included in film critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>'s list of "100 Great Movies" in 2001 and in "Time"s <a href="Time%20magazine%27s%20%26quot%3BAll-TIME%26quot%3B%20100%20best%20movies">All-Time 100 best movies</a> list in 2005.

"Pather Panchali" was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life—"<a href="Aparajito">Aparajito</a>" ("The Unvanquished") in 1956 and "<a href="Apur%20Sansar">Apur Sansar</a>" ("The World of Apu") in 1959. Together, the three films constitute the <a href="Apu%20trilogy">Apu trilogy</a>. "Aparajito" portrays the adolescent Apu, his education in a rural school and a Calcutta college. Its central theme is the poignant relationship between a doting mother and her ambitious young son. "Apur Sansar" depicts Apu's adult life, his reaction to his wife's premature death, and his final bonding with his son whom he abandoned as an infant. The sequels also won many national and international awards. Ray did not initially plan to make a trilogy: he decided to make the third film only after being asked about the possibility of a trilogy at the 1957 <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>, where "Aparajito" won the <a href="Golden%20Lion">Golden Lion</a>. "<a href="Apur%20Panchali">Apur Panchali</a>" (2014) is a Bengali film directed by <a href="Kaushik%20Ganguly">Kaushik Ganguly</a>, which depicts the real-life story of Subir Bannerjee, the actor who portrayed Apu in "Pather Panchali".

"Pather Panchali" was the first film made in independent India to receive major critical attention internationally, placing India on the world cinema map. It was one of the first examples of <a href="Parallel%20Cinema">Parallel Cinema</a>, a new tradition of Indian film-making in which authenticity and social realism were key themes, breaking the rule of the Indian film establishment. Although "Pather Panchali" was described as a turning point in <a href="Cinema%20of%20India">Indian cinema</a>, some commentators preferred the view that it refined a "realist textual principle" that was already there. In 1963 "Time" noted that thanks to "Pather Panchali", Satyajit Ray was one of the "hardy little band of inspired pioneers" of a new cinematic movement that was enjoying a good number of imitators worldwide. The film has since been considered as a "global landmark" and "among the essential moviegoing experiences". On 2 May 2013, commemorating Ray's birthday, the Indian version of the search engine Google displayed <a href="Google%20logo">a doodle</a> featuring the train sequence.

After "Pather Panchali", Ray went on to make 36 more films, including feature films, documentaries and <a href="short%20film">shorts</a>. He worked on <a href="screenplay">scripting</a>, casting, <a href="Film%20score">scoring</a>, <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a>, <a href="art%20director">art direction</a> and editing, as well as designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based, as was the case with "Pather Panchali", on visual lyricism and strongly humanistic themes. Thus, Ray established himself as an internationally recognized <a href="Auteur%20theory">auteur</a> of cinema.

Lōʻihi Seamount

Lōihi Seamount (also known as Lōʻihi) is an active <a href="submarine%20volcano">submarine volcano</a> about off the southeast coast of the island of <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. The top of the seamount is about below <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>. This seamount is on the flank of <a href="Mauna%20Loa">Mauna Loa</a>, the largest <a href="shield%20volcano">shield volcano</a> on Earth. Lōihi, meaning "long" in Hawaiian, is the newest volcano in the <a href="Hawaiian-Emperor%20seamount%20chain">Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain</a>, a string of volcanoes that stretches over northwest of Lōʻihi. Unlike most active volcanoes in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> that make up the active <a href="plate%20tectonics">plate margins</a> on the <a href="Pacific%20Ring%20of%20Fire">Pacific Ring of Fire</a>, Lōʻihi and the other volcanoes of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain are <a href="Hotspot%20%28geology%29">hotspot volcanoes</a> and formed well away from the nearest <a href="Plate%20tectonics%23Types%20of%20plate%20boundaries">plate boundary</a>. Volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands arise from the <a href="Hawaii%20hotspot">Hawaii hotspot</a>, and as the youngest volcano in the chain, Lōihi is the only Hawaiian volcano in the deep submarine <a href="Evolution%20of%20Hawaiian%20volcanoes%23Submarine%20preshield%20stage">preshield stage</a> of development.

Lōihi began forming around 400,000 years ago and is expected to begin emerging above sea level about 10,000–100,000 years from now. At its summit, Lōʻihi Seamount stands more than above the seafloor, making it taller than <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a> was before its catastrophic <a href="1980%20eruption%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens">1980 eruption</a>. A diverse <a href="%23Ecology">microbial community</a> resides around Lōihi's many <a href="hydrothermal%20vent">hydrothermal vent</a>s.

In the summer of 1996, a <a href="earthquake%20swarm">swarm</a> of 4,070 <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s was recorded at Lōʻihi. This series included more earthquakes than any other swarm in Hawaiian <a href="recorded%20history">recorded history</a>. The swarm altered of the seamount's summit; one section, "Pele's Vents", collapsed entirely upon itself and formed the renamed "Pele's Pit". The volcano has remained relatively active since the 1996 swarm and is monitored by the <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA) and the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS). The Hawaii Undersea Geological Observatory (HUGO) provided real-time data on Lōʻihi between 1997 and 2002. Lōʻihi last erupted in 1996, before the earthquake swarm of that summer.

Lōʻihi is a <a href="seamount">seamount</a>, or <a href="Submarine%20volcano">underwater volcano</a>, on the flank of <a href="Mauna%20Loa">Mauna Loa</a>, the Earth's largest <a href="shield%20volcano">shield volcano</a>. It is the newest volcano created by the <a href="Hawaii%20hotspot">Hawaiʻi hotspot</a> in the extensive <a href="Hawaiian-Emperor%20seamount%20chain">Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain</a>. The distance between the summit of the older Mauna Loa and the summit of Lōʻihi is about , which is, coincidentally, also the approximate diameter of the Hawaiʻi <a href="Hotspot%20%28geology%29">hotspot</a>. Lōʻihi consists of a summit area with three <a href="pit%20crater">pit crater</a>s, an long <a href="rift%20zone">rift zone</a> extending north from the summit, and a long rift zone extending south-southeast from the summit.

The summit's <a href="pit%20crater">pit crater</a>s are named West Pit, East Pit, and Pele's Pit. Pele's Pit is the youngest of this group and is located at the southern part of the summit. The walls of Pele's Pit stand high and were formed in July 1996 when its predecessor, Pele's Vent, a <a href="hydrothermal">hydrothermal</a> field near Lōʻihi's summit, collapsed into a large <a href="depression%20%28geology%29">depression</a>. The thick crater walls of Pele's Pit—averaging in width, unusually thick for Hawaiian volcanic craters—suggest its craters have filled with lava multiple times in the past.

Lōihi's north–south trending rift zones create a distinctive elongated shape, from which the volcano's Hawaiian name, meaning "long", derives. The north rift zone consists of a longer western portion and a shorter eastern rift zone. Observations show that both the north and south rift zones lack sediment cover, indicating recent activity. A bulge in the western part of the north rift zone contains three cone-shaped prominences.

Until 1970, Lōihi was thought to be an inactive volcano that had been transported to its current location by <a href="sea-floor%20spreading">sea-floor spreading</a>. The seafloor under Hawaii is years old and was created at the <a href="East%20Pacific%20Rise">East Pacific Rise</a>, an <a href="Mid-ocean%20ridge">oceanic spreading center</a> where new sea floor forms from magma that erupts from the mantle. New <a href="oceanic%20crust">oceanic crust</a> moves away from the spreading center. Over a period of years, the sea floor under Hawaii moved from the East Pacific Rise to its present location west, carrying ancient seamounts with it. When scientists investigated a series of earthquakes off Hawaii in 1970, they discovered that Lōihi was an active member of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain.
Lōʻihi is built on the seafloor with a slope of about five degrees. Its northern base on the flank of Mauna Loa is below sea level, but its southern base is a more substantial below the surface. Thus, the summit is above the seafloor as measured from the base of its north flank, but high when measured from the base of its southern flank.

Lōihi is following the <a href="Evolution%20of%20Hawaiian%20volcanoes">pattern of development</a> that is characteristic of all Hawaiian volcanoes. <a href="Geochemical">Geochemical</a> evidence from Lōihi lavas indicates that Lōihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and a lower level of activity, producing an <a href="alkali">alkali</a> <a href="basalt">basalt</a> lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of <a href="Landslide%23Debris%20flow">debris</a> inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.

<a href="Radiometric%20dating">Radiometric dating</a> was used to determine the age of rock samples from Lōʻihi. The <a href="Hawaii%20Center%20for%20Volcanology">Hawaii Center for Volcanology</a> tested samples recovered by various expeditions, notably the 1978 expedition, which provided 17 dredge samples. Most of the samples were found to be of recent origin; the oldest dated rock is around 300,000 years old. Following the 1996 event, some young <a href="breccia">breccia</a> was also collected. Based on the samples, scientists estimate Lōʻihi is about 400,000 years old. The rock accumulates at an average rate of per year near the base, and near the summit. If the data model from other volcanoes such as <a href="K%C4%ABlauea">Kīlauea</a> holds true for Lōʻihi, 40% of the volcano's mass formed within the last 100,000 years. Assuming a linear growth rate, Lōihi is 250,000 years old. However, as with all hotspot volcanoes, Lōihi's level of activity has increased with time; therefore, it would take at least 400,000 years for such a volcano to reach Lōihi's mass. As Hawaiian volcanoes drift northwest at a rate of about a year, Lōʻihi was southeast of its current position at the time of its initial eruption.

Lōihi is a young and fairly active volcano, although less active than nearby <a href="K%C4%ABlauea">Kīlauea</a>. In the past few decades, several <a href="earthquake%20swarm">earthquake swarm</a>s have been attributed to Lōihi, the largest of which are summarized in the table below. The volcano's activity is now known to predate scientific record keeping of its activity, which commenced in 1959. Most earthquake swarms at Lōihi have lasted less than two days; the two exceptions are the 1991–92 earthquake, lasting several months, and the 1996 event, which was shorter but much more pronounced. Both of the earthquakes followed a pattern of activity that began on the flank and migrated to the summit. The 1996 event was directly observed by an autonomous ocean bottom observatory (OBO), allowing scientists to calculate the depth of the earthquakes as to below the summit, approximating to the position of Lōihi's extremely shallow <a href="magma%20chamber">magma chamber</a>. This is evidence that Lōʻihi's seismicity is volcanic in origin.

The low-level seismic activity documented on Lōihi since 1959 has shown that between two and ten earthquakes per month are traceable to the summit. Earthquake swarm data have been used to analyze how well Lōihi's rocks propagate <a href="seismic%20wave">seismic wave</a>s and to investigate the relationship between earthquakes and eruptions. This low level activity is periodically punctuated by large swarms of earthquakes, each swarm comprising up to hundreds of earthquakes. The majority of the earthquakes are not distributed close to the summit, though they follow a north–south trend. Rather, most of the earthquakes occur in the southwest portion of Lōʻihi. The largest recorded swarms took place on Lōihi in 1971, 1972, 1975, 1991–92 and 1996. The nearest seismic station is around from Lōʻihi, on the south coast of <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. Seismic events that have a <a href="Moment%20magnitude%20scale">magnitude</a> under 2 are recorded often, but their location cannot be determined precisely as it can for larger events. In fact, HUGO (Hawaii Undersea Geological Observatory), positioned on Lōihi's flank, detected ten times as many earthquakes as were recorded by the <a href="Hawaiian%20Volcano%20Observatory">Hawaiian Volcano Observatory</a> (HVO) seismic network.

The largest amount of activity recorded for the Lōihi seamount was a <a href="Earthquake%20swarm">swarm</a> of 4,070 earthquakes between July 16 and August 9, 1996. This series of earthquakes was the largest recorded for any Hawaiian volcano to date in both amount and intensity. Most of the earthquakes had <a href="Moment%20magnitude%20scale">moment magnitudes</a> of less than 3.0. "Several hundred" had a magnitude greater than 3.0, including more than 40 greater than 4.0 and a 5.0 tremor.

The final two weeks of the earthquake swarm were observed by a quick response cruise launched in August 1996. The <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> funded an expedition by <a href="University%20of%20Hawaii">University of Hawaii</a> scientists, led by Frederick Duennebier, that began investigating the swarm and its origin in August 1996. The scientists' assessment laid the groundwork for many of the expeditions that followed. Follow-up expeditions to Lōʻihi took place, including a series of <a href="Submersible">manned-submersible</a> dives in August and September.
These were supplemented by a great deal of shore-based research. Fresh rock collected during the expedition revealed that an eruption occurred "before" the earthquake swarm.

Submersible dives in August were followed by <a href="NOAA">NOAA</a>-funded research in September and October 1996. These more detailed studies showed the southern portion of Lōʻihi's summit had collapsed, a result of a swarm of earthquakes and the rapid withdrawal of magma from the volcano. A crater across and deep formed out of the rubble. The event involved the movement of cubic meters of <a href="Volcano%23Erupted%20material">volcanic material</a>. A region of 10 to 13 km (4 to 5 sq mi) of the summit was altered and populated by bus-sized <a href="Igneous%23Extrusive%20igneous%20rocks">pillow lava blocks</a>, precariously perched along the outer rim of the newly formed crater. "Pele's Vents," an area on the southern side, previously considered stable, collapsed completely into a giant pit, renamed "Pele's Pit". Strong currents make submersible diving hazardous in the region.

The researchers were continually met by clouds of <a href="sulfide">sulfide</a> and <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a>. The sudden collapse of Pele's Vents caused a large discharge of hydrothermal material. The presence of certain indicator minerals in the mixture suggested temperatures exceeded 250 °C, a record for an underwater volcano. The composition of the materials was similar to that of <a href="black%20smokers">black smokers</a>, the hydrothermal vent plumes located along <a href="mid-ocean%20ridge">mid-ocean ridge</a>s. Samples from mounds built by discharges from the hydrothermal plumes resembled <a href="white%20smoker">white smoker</a>s.

The studies demonstrated that the most volcanically and hydrothermally active area was along the southern rift. Dives on the less active northern rim indicated that the terrain was more stable there, and high <a href="Lava">lava columns</a> were still standing upright. A new hydrothermal vent field (Naha Vents) was located in the upper-south rift zone, at a depth of .

Lōʻihi has remained largely quiet since the 1996 event; no activity was recorded from 2002 to 2004. The seamount showed signs of life again in 2005 by generating an earthquake bigger than any previously recorded there. USGS-ANSS (<a href="Advanced%20National%20Seismic%20System">Advanced National Seismic System</a>) reported two earthquakes, <a href="Moment%20magnitude%20scale">magnitudes</a> 5.1 and 5.4, on May 13 and July 17. Both originated from a depth of . On April 23, a magnitude 4.3 earthquake was recorded at a depth of approximately . Between December 7, 2005, and January 18, 2006, a swarm of around 100 earthquakes occurred, the largest measuring 4 on the <a href="Moment%20magnitude%20scale">Moment magnitude scale</a> and to deep. Another earthquake measuring 4.7 was later recorded approximately midway between Lōihi and <a href="P%C4%81hala">Pāhala</a> (on the south coast of the <a href="Hawaii%20%28Island%29">Hawaii (Island)</a>).

Lōʻihi Seamount's first depiction on a map was on Survey Chart 4115, a <a href="bathymetric">bathymetric</a> rendering of part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the <a href="US%20Coast%20and%20Geodetic%20Survey">US Coast and Geodetic Survey</a> in 1940. At the time, the seamount was non-notable, being one of many in the region. A large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952. That same year, geologist <a href="Gordon%20A.%20MacDonald">Gordon A. MacDonald</a> hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine <a href="shield%20volcano">shield volcano</a>, similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, <a href="Mauna%20Loa">Mauna Loa</a> and <a href="K%C4%ABlauea">Kīlauea</a>. Macdonald's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the <a href="Hawaiian-Emperor%20seamount%20chain">Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain</a>, created by the <a href="Hawaii%20hotspot">Hawaiʻi hotspot</a>. However, because the earthquakes were oriented east–west (the direction of the <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">volcanic fault</a>) and there was no <a href="Harmonic%20tremor">volcanic tremor</a> in <a href="seismometer">seismometer</a>s distant from the seamount, Macdonald attributed the earthquake to <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">faulting</a> rather than a <a href="volcanic%20eruption">volcanic eruption</a>.
Geologists suspected the seamount could be an active undersea volcano, but without evidence the idea remained speculative. The volcano was largely ignored after the 1952 event, and was often mislabeled as an "older volcanic feature" in subsequent charts. Geologist Kenneth O. Emery is credited with naming the seamount in 1955, describing the long and narrow shape of the volcano as "Loihi". The <a href="Hawaiian%20language">Hawaiian</a> word lōʻihi means "long". In 1978, an expedition studied intense, repeated seismic activity known as <a href="earthquake%20swarm">earthquake swarm</a>s in and around the Lōʻihi area. Rather than finding an old, extinct seamount, data collected revealed Lōʻihi to be a young, possibly active volcano. Observations showed the volcano to be encrusted with young and old lava flows. Fluids erupting from active hydrothermal vents were also found.

In 1978, a <a href="US%20Geological%20Survey">US Geological Survey</a> <a href="research%20ship">research ship</a> collected <a href="dredge">dredge</a> samples and photographed Lōʻihi's summit with the goal of studying whether Lōʻihi is active. Analysis of the photos and testing of <a href="pillow%20lava">pillow lava</a> rock samples appeared to show that the material was "fresh", yielding more evidence that Lōʻihi is still active. An expedition from October 1980 to January 1981 collected further dredge samples and photographs, providing additional confirmation. Studies indicated that the eruptions came from the southern part of the rift crater. This area is closest to the Hawaiʻi hotspot, which supplies Lōʻihi with <a href="magma">magma</a>. Following a 1986 seismic event, a network of five ocean bottom observatories (OBOs) were deployed on Lōʻihi for a month. Lōʻihi's frequent seismicity makes it an ideal candidate for seismic study through OBOs. In 1987, the <a href="submersible">submersible</a> <a href="DSV%20Alvin">DSV Alvin</a> was used to <a href="Traverse%20%28surveying%29">survey</a> Lōʻihi.
Another autonomous observatory was positioned on Lōʻihi in 1991 to track earthquake swarms.

The bulk of information about Lōʻihi comes from dives made in response to the 1996 eruption. In a dive conducted almost immediately after seismic activity was reported, visibility was greatly reduced by high concentrations of displaced minerals and large floating mats of bacteria in the water. The bacteria that feed on the dissolved nutrients had already begun colonizing the new hydrothermal vents at Pele's Pit (formed from the collapse of the old ones), and may be indicators of the kinds of material ejected from the newly formed vents. They were carefully sampled for further analysis in a laboratory. An OBO briefly sat on the summit before a more permanent probe could be installed.

Repeated multibeam <a href="Bathymetric%20chart">bathymetric mapping</a> was used to measure the changes in the summit following the 1996 collapse. <a href="Hydrothermal%20vent">Hydrothermal plume</a> surveys confirmed changes in the energy, and dissolved minerals emanating from Lōʻihi. <a href="Hawaii%20Undersea%20Research%20Laboratory">Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory</a>, HURL's submersible "Pisces V" allowed scientists to sample the vent waters, microorganisms and hydrothermal mineral deposits.

Since 2006, the Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory (FeMO), funded by the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> and Microbial Observatory Program, has led cruises to Lōʻihi investigate its <a href="microbiology">microbiology</a> every October. The first cruise, on the ship "R/V Melville" and exploiting the submersible "JASON2", lasted from September 22 to October 9. These cruises study the large number of <a href="Chemotroph">Fe-oxidizing bacteria</a> that have colonized Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi's extensive <a href="Hydrothermal%20vent">vent system</a> is characterized by a high concentration of <a href="CO2">CO</a> and <a href="Iron">Iron</a>, while being low in sulfide. These characteristics make a perfect environment for iron-oxidizing <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, called FeOB, to thrive in.

In 1997, scientists from the <a href="University%20of%20Hawaii">University of Hawaiʻi</a> installed an ocean bottom observatory (OBO) on the summit of Lōʻihi Seamount. The submarine observatory was nicknamed HUGO, (Hawaiʻi Undersea Geological Observatory). HUGO was connected to the shore, away, by a <a href="Fiber%20optics">fiber optic cable</a>. It gave scientists real-time seismic, chemical and visual data about the state of Lōʻihi, which had by then become an international laboratory for the study of undersea volcanism. The cable that provided HUGO with power and communications broke in October 1998, effectively shutting it down. On January 19 of the following year, HUGO was visited by "Pisces V" and repaired. The observatory functioned for four years before it went dead again in 2002.

Lōʻihi's mid-Pacific location and its well-sustained hydrothermal system contribute to a rich oasis for a microbial <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. Areas of extensive <a href="hydrothermal%20vent">hydrothermal vent</a>ing are found on Lōʻihi's <a href="Volcanic%20crater">crater floor</a> and north slope, and along the summit of Lōʻihi itself. Active hydrothermal vents were first discovered at Lōʻihi in the late 1980s. These vents are remarkably similar to those found at the <a href="mid-ocean%20ridge">mid-ocean ridge</a>s, with similar composition and thermal differences. The two most prominent vent fields are at the summit: "Pele's Pit" (formally "Pele's Vents") and "Kapo's Vents". They are named after the Hawaiian <a href="deity">deity</a> <a href="Pele%20%28deity%29">Pele</a> and her sister <a href="Kapo%20%28mythology%29">Kapo</a>. These vents were considered "low temperature vents" because their waters were only about 30 °C. The volcanic eruption of 1996 and the creation of Pele's Pit changed this, and initiated high temperature venting; exit temperatures were measured at 77 °C in 1996.

The vents lie to below the surface, and range in <a href="temperature">temperature</a> from 10 to over . The vent fluids are characterized by a high concentration of (up to 17 mM) and Fe (<a href="Iron">Iron</a>), but low in <a href="sulfide">sulfide</a>. Low oxygen and <a href="pH">pH</a> levels are important factors in supporting the high amounts of Fe (iron), one of the hallmark features of Lōʻihi. These characteristics make a perfect environment for iron-oxidizing bacteria, called FeOB, to thrive in. An example of these species is "<a href="Mariprofundus%20ferrooxydans">Mariprofundus ferrooxydans</a>", sole member of the class <a href="Zetaproteobacteria">Zetaproteobacteria</a>. The composition of the materials was similar to that of <a href="black%20smoker">black smoker</a>s, that are a habitat of <a href="Extremophile">archaea extremophiles</a>. <a href="Dissolution%20%28chemistry%29">Dissolution</a> and <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> of the mineral observed over the next two years suggests the sulfate is not easily preserved.

A diverse community of <a href="microbial%20mat">microbial mat</a>s surround the vents and virtually cover Pele's Pit.
The <a href="Hawaii%20Undersea%20Research%20Laboratory">Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory</a> (HURL), <a href="NOAA">NOAA</a>'s Research Center for Hawaiʻi and the Western Pacific, monitors and researches the hydrothermal systems and studies the local community.
The <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> (<a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">NSF</a>) funded an <a href="extremophile">extremophile</a> sampling expedition to Lōʻihi in 1999. Microbial mats surrounded the 160 °C vents, and included a novel <a href="Jellyfish">jelly</a>-like organism. Samples were collected for study at NSF's Marine Bioproducts Engineering Center (MarBEC). In 2001, "<a href="Pisces%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BV">Pisces V</a>" collected samples of the organisms and brought them to the surface for study.

NOAA's National Undersea Research Center and NSF's Marine Bioproducts Engineering Center are cooperating to sample and research the local bacteria and archaea <a href="extremophiles">extremophiles</a>. The fourth FeMO (Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory) cruise occurred during October 2009.

Marine life inhabiting the waters around Lōʻihi is not as diverse as life at other, less active <a href="seamounts">seamounts</a>. Fish found living near Lōʻihi include the Celebes monkfish ("<a href="Sladenia_%28fish%29">Sladenia remiger</a>"), and members of the Cutthroat eel family, <a href="Cutthroat%20eel">Synaphobranchidae</a>. <a href="Invertebrate">Invertebrate</a>s identified in the area include two species <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the hydrothermal vents, a <a href="Bresilioidea">bresiliid shrimp</a> ("Opaepele loihi") of the family <a href="Alvinocarididae">Alvinocarididae</a> (described in 1995), and a tube or <a href="Siboglinidae">pogonophoran worm</a>. Dives conducted after the 1996 earthquake swarms were unable to find either the shrimp or the worm, and it is not known if there are lasting effects on these species.

From 1982 to 1992, researchers in <a href="National%20Undersea%20Research%20Program">Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory</a> <a href="submersible">submersible</a>s photographed the fish of Lōʻihi Seamount, <a href="Johnston%20Atoll">Johnston Atoll</a>, and <a href="Cross%20Seamount">Cross Seamount</a> at depths between and . A small number of species identified at Lōʻihi were newly recorded sightings in Hawaiʻi, including the Tassled coffinfish ("<a href="Sea%20toad">Chaunax fimbriatus</a>"), and the Celebes monkfish.

Hamersley, Western Australia

Hamersley is a residential <a href="List%20of%20Perth%20suburbs">suburb</a> north-northwest of the <a href="central%20business%20district">central business district</a> of <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, the capital of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, and six kilometres (4 mi) from the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. The suburb adjoins two major arterial roads—<a href="Mitchell%20Freeway">Mitchell Freeway</a> to the west and <a href="Reid%20Highway">Reid Highway</a> to the south—and is within the <a href="City%20of%20Stirling">City of Stirling</a> <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Australia">local government area</a>. It was built during the late 1960s and 1970s as part of the <a href="Government%20of%20Western%20Australia">Government of Western Australia</a>'s response to rapidly increasing land prices across the metropolitan area.

Before development, Hamersley was a remote district covered in <a href="Eucalyptus%20marginata">jarrah</a>, <a href="Corymbia%20calophylla">marri</a>, <a href="banksia">banksia</a> and other vegetation typical of the <a href="Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a>, with small areas cleared for <a href="small-scale%20agriculture">small-scale agriculture</a> such as <a href="market%20gardening">market gardening</a> and <a href="poultry">poultry</a> farming. By 1974, six years after the first subdivision, Hamersley was home to the district's first community hall, an annual parade and fair which were broadcast on Perth TV and radio, an active progress association, and its own newspaper, the "Hamersley Gazette", a forerunner to today's "Stirling Times". Rapid growth further north removed the focus from Hamersley, which was completed in 1981 and has remained relatively stable since then.

Significant reserves of remnant <a href="The%20Bush">bushland</a> remain in parts of the suburb. The largest of these is an exclusion zone around the high <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">ABC</a> radio tower in the suburb's southeast, which broadcasts <a href="AM%20broadcasting">AM</a> stations to the Perth metropolitan area. The <a href="radio%20masts%20and%20towers">guyed tower</a> was built in 1939 and is a landmark in the region, although it has been a local political issue since the 1980s.

Hamersley is in the northern suburbs of <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, within the <a href="City%20of%20Stirling">City of Stirling</a>, and from the Indian Ocean. Its borders are the <a href="Mitchell%20Freeway">Mitchell Freeway</a> to the west, <a href="Reid%20Highway">Reid Highway</a> and the <a href="Balcatta%2C%20Western%20Australia">Balcatta</a> industrial area to the south, <a href="Wanneroo%20Road">Wanneroo Road</a> to the east, and <a href="Beach%20Road%2C%20Perth">Beach Road</a> and the <a href="City%20of%20Joondalup">City of Joondalup</a> to the north. The suburb is divided into western and eastern portions by <a href="Erindale%20Road">Erindale Road</a>. Hamersley was one of the first Perth suburbs to be guided by the principles of <a href="cul-de-sac">cul-de-sac</a> design, and many of its minor streets are joined by parks and pathways.

Hamersley covers and averages above sea level, although portions of the loop formed by Rannoch Circle in the eastern portion are <a href="Above%20mean%20sea%20level">above sea level</a>. A real estate magazine remarked in 1994 that "homes around the Rannoch circle enjoy some spectacular views to the city and the hills", and that "a few lucky householders... could even catch ocean glimpses, despite being more than six kilometres from the water."

The restricted-access bushland reserve surrounding the ABC radio tower in the suburb's southeast covers 14.4% () of its area, while parks and areas of natural bushland are spread throughout. The largest of these are Aintree-Eglinton Reserve, a grassed reserve next to the community centre complex, and Rannoch-Tay-Earn Reserve, a reserve containing large areas of native bushland interspersed with grassed and paved walkways. A biodiversity site north of the community centre is recognised by the City of Stirling's Green Plan 2.

Streets in western Hamersley are generally named after English towns, while eastern Hamersley uses the names of Scottish <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Highland</a> and <a href="Perthshire">Perthshire</a> towns and <a href="loch">loch</a>s. There are exceptions – the origins of Vickers Street precinct street names are unknown, while streets in the south-western corner are named after the "<a href="Bentley%20Boys">Bentley Boys</a>", a group of British racing drivers from the 1920s and 1930s, and their car designer <a href="W.%20O.%20Bentley">Walter Owen Bentley</a>.

Hamersley's soil is an infertile yellow-brown sand composed of fine to coarse <a href="quartz">quartz</a> grains, with <a href="Tamala%20Limestone">Tamala Limestone</a> beneath. Locally known as Karrakatta Sand, it is almost certainly the <a href="Leaching%20%28chemical%20science%29">leached</a> remnants of coastal sand deposited by <a href="eolian%20processes">eolian processes</a> in the late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> period, between 11,000 and 100,000 years ago. Below the sand are <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> rocks of the <a href="Perth%20Basin">Perth Basin</a>. The sand contains an unconfined <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a> with large supplies of low-salinity potable <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> which is recharged by rainfall.

As with other infertile areas of the <a href="Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a>, Hamersley would have supported open forests of "<a href="Eucalyptus%20marginata">Eucalyptus marginata</a>" (Jarrah) with "<a href="Corymbia%20calophylla">Corymbia calophylla</a>" (Marri) or "<a href="Eucalyptus%20gomphocephala">Eucalyptus gomphocephala</a>" (Tuart), and an understorey of "<a href="Banksia%20attenuata">Banksia attenuata</a>" (Candlestick Banksia), "<a href="Banksia%20menziesii">B. menziesii</a>" (Firewood Banksia), "<a href="Banksia%20grandis">B. grandis</a>" (Bull Banksia), "<a href="Allocasuarina%20fraseriana">Allocasuarina fraseriana</a>" (Western Sheoak) and "<a href="Agonis%20flexuosa">Agonis flexuosa</a>" (Swan River Peppermint). The main shrub species would have been "<a href="Jacksonia%20sternbergiana">Jacksonia sternbergiana</a>" (Stinkwood), "<a href="Jacksonia%20furcellata">J. furcellata</a>" (Grey Stinkwood), "<a href="Acacia%20cyclops">Acacia cyclops</a>" (Coastal Wattle), "<a href="Acacia%20saligna">Acacia saligna</a>" (Orange Wattle), "<a href="Hibbertia">Hibbertia</a>" species, "<a href="Allocasuarina%20humilis">Allocasuarina humilis</a>" (Dwarf Sheoak), "<a href="Calothamnus%20quadrifidus">Calothamnus quadrifidus</a>" (One-sided Bottlebrush) and "<a href="Grevillea%20thelemanniana">Grevillea thelemanniana</a>" (Spider Net Grevillea). Biodiversity surveys in 2006 have also identified a relatively rare species, "<a href="Jacksonia%20sericea">Jacksonia sericea</a>" (Waldjumi), in two eastern Hamersley reserves.

Hamersley was named after the <a href="Hamersley%20family">Hamersley family</a> who arrived in the <a href="Swan%20River%20Colony">Swan River Colony</a> in 1837 and established themselves at <a href="Guildford%2C%20Western%20Australia">Guildford</a>. There is no evidence they ever visited modern Hamersley, but in 1869 they built a summer home in what is now <a href="North%20Beach%2C%20Western%20Australia">North Beach</a>, to the west, and bought considerable holdings in the area over the following years.

The name first came into use to describe the north-western section of the <a href="City%20of%20Stirling">Perth Road District</a> in 1906. Hamersley Ward was a large area of land covering what is now Hamersley, <a href="Carine%2C%20Western%20Australia">Carine</a>, <a href="Watermans%20Bay%2C%20Western%20Australia">Watermans Bay</a>, <a href="North%20Beach%2C%20Western%20Australia">North Beach</a>, <a href="Gwelup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Gwelup</a> and parts of <a href="Balcatta%2C%20Western%20Australia">Balcatta</a>, <a href="Karrinyup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Karrinyup</a> and <a href="Trigg%2C%20Western%20Australia">Trigg</a>. The Hamersley townsite, consisting of Hamersley Ward, was gazetted in 1945. As a result, many facilities in North Beach, including a primary school, a golf course, several sporting clubs and residents' and seniors' associations, were called Hamersley. After the Hamersley Development Scheme started in 1968, confusion as to exactly what Hamersley referred to led to conflict between established organisations in North Beach and emerging ones in Hamersley – the "Hamersley Gazette" noted in 1973 that "North Beach people have the prior claim but ours is more officially accepted".

The suburb was gazetted as a locality by the City of Stirling on 24 October 1975, although it had existed as a postal locality since 1971.

Before European settlement, Hamersley was part of a larger area of land that was occupied by the <a href="Mooro">Mooro</a> people, an <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australian</a> people who traversed the lakes and wetlands running parallel to the coast between what is now Perth and <a href="Yanchep%2C%20Western%20Australia">Yanchep</a>.

Soon after the establishment of the <a href="Swan%20River%20Colony">Swan River Colony</a>, colonial authorities divided up the land into grants which were given to settlers who had brought capital in to the new settlement. Southern Hamersley became part of Location K, a strip of land extending west from <a href="Caversham%2C%20Western%20Australia">Caversham</a> on the <a href="Swan%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Swan River</a> to Big Carine Swamp, which was granted to Robert Ansell Partridge in September 1829. The western part of this, first surveyed by P.L.S. Chauncy in 1843, remained fairly inaccessible, and the only development in the area was the construction of the Daviot Park cottage on Old Balcatta Road southwest of Hamersley. By the late 1930s, portions in the far west and south-east of the suburb had been cleared for small-scale agriculture such as market gardening, and in 1939 the Department of the Interior constructed a tower and other facilities for ABC <a href="AM%20broadcasting">AM</a> and <a href="shortwave">shortwave</a> radio broadcasts on <a href="Wanneroo%20Road">Wanneroo Road</a>.

Northern Hamersley, meanwhile, became part of <a href="Swan%20Land%20District">Swan</a> Location 1315, which extended north to <a href="Lake%20Goollelal">Lake Goollelal</a> and west to the coast and was granted in the 1890s to the Midland Railway Company after being surveyed by Crossland & Co. in 1892, and by N. Lymburner in 1894. It appears that no development occurred in northern Hamersley, other than the construction of Beach and Carine Roads in 1900, and the State Housing Commission resumed the land in November 1950. In 1962, a <a href="alfalfa">lucerne</a> grower with a property on Duffy Road, Carine applied to use the northern half of the suburb as a <a href="Sheep%20station%23Language%20use">sheep run</a>. The Shire President, Herbert R. Robinson, refused to grant permission, saying that "land might soon be needed for housing". The "West Australian" reported in 1967 that the area was still "virtually untouched bushland".

In the late 1960s, concern about the growth of land prices in the Perth metropolitan area, which for several years had exceeded the <a href="consumer%20price%20index">consumer price index</a>, led to the <a href="Premier%20of%20Western%20Australia">Premier of Western Australia</a>, <a href="David%20Brand">David Brand</a>, convening an inter-departmental committee to study the problem. One of the committee's recommendations to Cabinet was to release 300 hectares of land owned by the State Housing Commission in Hamersley, Warwick and Greenwood which was on a much larger area that had been designated as "deferred urban" land under the Metropolitan Region Scheme in 1963. On 13 December 1967, the Metropolitan Region Planning Authority decided to rezone as urban all land bounded by <a href="Hepburn%20Avenue">Hepburn Avenue</a>, <a href="Marmion%20Avenue">Marmion Avenue</a>, <a href="Reid%20Highway">North Perimeter Highway</a> and <a href="Wanneroo%20Road">Wanneroo Road</a>, on the condition that <a href="subdivision%20%28land%29">subdivision</a> would be approved when "Town Planning (Development) Scheme(s) have been approved with the general object of serving the best possible development at the least cost to the community".

The Shires of Perth and Wanneroo combined to prepare Town Planning Scheme No.26 (<a href="Hamersley%20Development%20Scheme">Hamersley Development Scheme</a>), and by early March 1968, the scheme, which included provisions for <a href="water%20supply">water supply</a>, <a href="sanitary%20sewer">sewerage</a>, drainage, road construction and <a href="undergrounding">undergrounding</a> of <a href="electricity%20distribution">power mains</a>, was presented to both councils for consideration. A time limit of 3½ years for developers to construct homes on released land was built into the scheme in an effort to prevent land <a href="speculation">speculation</a>, which the inter-departmental committee believed was a key factor in spiralling prices in Perth. By July, however, negotiations between the councils broke down, and the Shire of Perth (now <a href="City%20of%20Stirling">City of Stirling</a>) decided to administer its own part of the scheme independently. The scheme was divided into nine sections, with what is now the suburb of Hamersley being the first stage.

In April 1968 the <a href="BankWest">R&I Bank</a>, a government-owned bank, was granted permission to subdivide a small area in northern Ardleigh Crescent in the suburb's west. The first auction of 80 lots on Saturday, 14 December 1968 was anticipated on the front page of "<a href="The%20West%20Australian">The West Australian</a>", with Premier Brand advising intending buyers to be cautious about their bids. At the auction, 76 lots were sold at an average price of <a href="Australian%20dollar">$</a>4,784, compared to $6,700 at a recent R&I Bank sale in the nearby suburb of <a href="Karrinyup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Karrinyup</a>, with newspapers agreeing that the Premier's warning had been heeded by bidders.

The western portion of Hamersley grew steadily over the following months and years, with segments being released, auctioned and developed by the R&I Bank, T&S Plunkett Homes and Parkland Housing. The Hamersley Development Scheme, however, was doomed almost before it started. Disagreements over issues such as undergrounding of power and the time limit clauses between the Town Planning Board and the Shire of Perth had caused delays in the scheme's approval. In July 1970, the Shire Planner reported that "there is little point in proceeding with the Scheme, especially in view of the large areas already subdivided", and recommended the council agree "that for all practical purposes, Town Planning Scheme No. 26. is defunct". By the February 1971 state election, over 1,000 eligible voters lived in the district.

In June 1970, the Metropolitan Region Planning Authority released land in the southwestern corner of Hamersley, which had previously been held in reserve under the Metropolitan Region Scheme for a large freeway interchange between the future <a href="Mitchell%20Freeway">Mitchell Freeway</a> (then known as Stephenson Freeway) and <a href="Reid%20Highway">Reid Highway</a> (North Perimeter Freeway). The result of these changes was to allow the construction of Walter Way, Dutton Crescent and connecting streets, which were named after racing drivers from the 1920s and 1930s.

Between 1971 and 1973, reserves, public recreation areas and drainage sites were set aside in western Hamersley, and facilities were erected in quick succession – the 1st Hamersley <a href="Scout%20Group">Scout Group</a> in 1973, the colonial-style Holy Cross <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Australia">Anglican Church</a> in 1974, and a community hall at Aintree Street in 1975. Residents in the region were at this time on the fringe of Perth's suburban area, relying on partly built main roads, distant shopping centres and overstretched local facilities for several years after the suburb's construction. A locally produced fortnightly newspaper, the "Hamersley Gazette", started in early 1973 by Peter Flanigan, from his home in Manton Court, covering the suburbs of Carine, Hamersley, Warwick and Greenwood, with the open aim of helping to form community associations and campaign for better facilities. A July 1973 article, for example, lamented that "work on Erindale Road appears to have come to a standstill... great piles of dirt and unmade road surfaces bear testimony to the fact that something is going on, or should be going on, but this one is taking a very long time."

However, there were also celebrations – the paper reported in detail on the annual Glendale Spring Fair, held between 1973 and 1976 by the Glendale <a href="Parents%20and%20Citizens">P&C</a> Association on the second Saturday in November. It included activities for children, marching bands provided by <a href="The%20Salvation%20Army">The Salvation Army</a> and the <a href="Australian%2010th%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment">Australian 10th Light Horse Regiment</a>, and a parade along Glendale Avenue and Beach Road at 10:30 am. Intended originally as a fundraiser for the school, the "Gazette" reported that it was "a sort of glorified féte that rapidly outgrew its origins", with live coverage of the parade on <a href="720%20ABC%20Perth">ABC radio</a> and on television station <a href="TVW">TVW</a>-7 and personalities such as <a href="Jeff%20Newman%20%28TV%20personality%29">Jeff Newman</a> in attendance. The fair, however, became the victim of a dispute over naming rights between the Glendale P&C, community groups and commercial sponsors. Other events included the grand opening of Warwick Grove Shopping Centre on 13 November 1974, the greening of Aintree-Eglinton Reserve and the activities of the Hamersley Progress Association. The paper was acquired in February 1977 by Bill Marwick of the "Wanneroo Times", and evolved into the "Stirling Times" in 1980.
Meanwhile, work was only starting in eastern Hamersley. In 1973 Project Homes acquired a poultry farm and agricultural holding, and completed the construction of Vickers Street and adjoining roads, with Don Place becoming a display village. In 1974 the City of Stirling agreed, after complex negotiations, to sell 4.2 hectares of land comprising Carine Road and Allen Street to the State Housing Commission and to War Service Homes in order to "facilitate a satisfactory subdivisional design of adjoining land held by the State Housing Commission" in the eastern portion of the suburb. All that remains of these two early roads are paved pathways within the Rannoch-Tay-Earn Reserve, which was gazetted in 1976. By July 1975, 200 defence service homes were under construction on land immediately to the east of Erindale Road, to be made available to veterans from March 1976. The rest of eastern Hamersley was built over the next few years, and by 1981 development was essentially complete. The community hall was redeveloped into a full-fledged community centre, which officially opened in 1990.

Despite Hamersley's stability in the years since 1981 and its relatively low crime rate, it has periodically drawn the attention of the Perth media. In July 2000, a man bludgeoned his former girlfriend, mother-of-two Deborah Boyd, to death in a rented home in Brabant Way. He was subsequently sentenced to strict-security life imprisonment. On 23 January 2006, a large scrub fire caused the closure of Reid Highway and delays in rail line services during the afternoon <a href="rush%20hour">rush hour</a>.

At the <a href="Australian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics">ABS</a> <a href="Census%20in%20Australia">2011 census</a>, Hamersley had a population of 4,982 people. This was an increase of 17 people from the 2006 census, a decline of 246 people from the 2001 census, and a decline of 605 people from the 1996 census.

Hamersley residents had a median age of 39, compared to the Perth average of 36. The median household income in Hamersley was around the average for the region and for Perth—$1,489 per week compared with $1,518 and $1,459 per week respectively. The 2011 Census figures put Hamersley's unemployment rate at 0.9% below the Perth average. Industry sectors in which Hamersley residents worked (2011) were comparable with those in Perth generally, with the largest proportions working in construction (11.9%), health care (11.4%), education and training (9.5%), retail trade (9.2%) and professional occupations (8.9%).

According to the City of Stirling, most of Hamersley's 2,084 dwellings are <a href="brick">brick</a> homes with an average lot size of 750 m². At the , the median monthly housing loan repayments in Hamersley were about $1755—somewhat lower than both the region and Perth generally ($2000). However, 41.0% of Hamersley's dwellings were fully owned, compared to 29.3% across the whole of Perth. In the year to March 2016, Hamersley's median house price was $565,000 versus $540,000 for the whole of Perth.

The population of Hamersley is predominantly Australian-born, with some 69.8% of its residents being born in Australia as at the 2011 census. The second most prevalent birthplace was the <a href="Anglo-Celtic%20Australian">United Kingdom</a> at 9.3%, followed by New Zealand at 3.6%. 6.4% of Hamersley's population reported one or both parents of <a href="Italian%20Australians">Italian</a> birth, with the strongest concentration in the Vickers Street district (13.4%). Other significant minorities included those of <a href="Chinese%20Australian">Chinese</a> (2.2%), <a href="Macedonian%20Australians">Macedonian</a> (1.9%), <a href="Indian%20Australian">Indian</a> (1.6%) heritage.

The most popular religious affiliations in descending order in the 2011 census were <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20in%20Australia">Roman Catholic</a>, no religion, <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Australia">Anglican</a>, <a href="Uniting%20Church%20in%20Australia">Uniting</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> and "Christian nfd". Holy Cross Hamersley is located on Glendale Ave, and is an Anglican church in the evangelical tradition. All Saints Catholic Church is in neighbouring <a href="Warwick%2C%20Western%20Australia">Warwick</a> and the local Uniting Churches are in Carine and Greenwood.

Hamersley is a residential suburb, relying on the Warwick Grove shopping centre on its northern boundary for commercial services, and is by road from <a href="Karrinyup%20Shopping%20Centre">Karrinyup Shopping Centre</a>. A light industrial area is to the south in <a href="Balcatta%2C%20Western%20Australia">Balcatta</a> which includes a large <a href="Bunnings%20Warehouse">Bunnings Warehouse</a> on Erindale Road approximately south of Hamersley.

Aintree-Eglinton Reserve, a grassed area covering , contains a <a href="cricket%20pitch">cricket pitch</a>, several practice runs and night lights for <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a>, which are utilised by local amateur and junior clubs. Within the reserve is the Hamersley Community Recreation Centre, first built in the 1970s as a community hall and opened in its present form on 22 April 1990. The centre is a small village area consisting of a central <a href="pergola">pergola</a> crossed with walking paths, flanked by four buildings: a sports hall with <a href="basketball">basketball</a> courts and kiosk, an arts and crafts building, a community hall and function building hosting <a href="discoth%C3%A8que">discos</a> and other social events, and a purpose-built children's centre. Near the centre are the 1st Hamersley Scout Group, a child health centre and the Holy Cross Anglican Church, a colonial-style building built in 1974 and consecrated on 14 December 1980 to serve the newly formed Balcatta-Hamersley Parish.

Numerous small parks are throughout all parts of Hamersley, usually joining the ends of several <a href="cul-de-sac">cul-de-sac</a>s and in some cases containing wooden benches or children's play equipment. The Rannoch-Tay-Earn reserve in eastern Hamersley also contains two <a href="barbecue">barbecue</a>s. The introduction of a barbecue and new playground equipment to the reserve first came in the late 1990s. 2008–2009 has seen the introduction of a new barbecue area due west of the playground with more introductions to the reserve to come.

The southeastern corner contains the <a href="720%20ABC%20Perth">ABC</a> 50 <a href="Kilowatt">kW</a> radio tower which transmits ABC AM radio in Perth, including <a href="ABC%20Local%20Radio">ABC Local Radio</a> (<a href="720%20ABC%20Perth">6WF</a>), <a href="Radio%20National">Radio National</a> and <a href="ABC%20NewsRadio">ABC NewsRadio</a>. Several other towers, including a 20 kW and 10 kW tower, are also at the site. Some residents argue that <a href="electromagnetic%20interference">electromagnetic interference</a> from the towers is adversely affecting their television and telephone reception, with the issue taken up in Federal parliament by local MPs. An inquiry was held by ACMA in November 2010 into the situation, which found that apart from some disturbance to ABC2 signals, TV and radio signals in the area were of acceptable strength and quality.

Hamersley contains two <a href="Education%20in%20Australia">state primary schools</a>, each of which includes facilities for pre-primary students, and a teaching resource centre. Hamersley is within the catchment area for <a href="Warwick%20Senior%20High%20School">Warwick Senior High School</a> for students from Years 8 to 12.
Hamersley's first school, Glendale Primary School in Glendale Avenue, opened in 1971 in the western portion of the suburb. The school and neighbouring kindergarten quickly became overcrowded as their <a href="catchment%20area%20%28human%20geography%29">catchment area</a> initially extended to <a href="Hepburn%20Avenue">Hepburn Avenue</a>, taking in <a href="Warwick%2C%20Western%20Australia">Warwick</a> and <a href="Greenwood%2C%20Western%20Australia">Greenwood</a> to its north. As schools were built in those suburbs in 1974–1976, congestion eased considerably. The school and kindergarten were also used as a hall and meeting place by residents and groups until the recreation centre opened in April 1975. In 2016, the school provided for 248 primary students between Year 1 and Year 6, and 28 pre-primary students.

From 1976 onward, the eastern portion of the suburb developed, and East Hamersley Primary School, in Doon Way, opened in February 1979. In 2006, the school provided for 109 primary, 30 pre-primary and 29 kindergarten students. Computer studies and <a href="Indonesian%20language">Indonesian language</a> are required subjects for students from Years 3 to 6. In the 1990s, the West Coast Resource Centre, a specialist borrowing library for teachers of kindergarten, pre-primary and primary classes, was built on the East Hamersley site by the Department of Education (now Education and Training) to serve schools in the northern suburbs.

Cars are the preferred mode of <a href="Transport%20in%20Australia">transport</a> in the suburb. At the 2011 census, the <a href="Australian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> reported that 68.8% of Hamersley's residents were drivers or passengers of cars in their commute to work, a figure only slightly lower than the north metropolitan average of 71.3%. Other private modes of transport included motorcycling (0.7%), cycling (1.1%) and walking (1.3%). The low number of walking commuters compared to the north metropolitan average of 1.5% and the Perth Statistical Region average of 1.81% is most likely due to the limited number of workplaces within walking distance.

Hamersley is situated at the intersection of several key <a href="arterial%20road">arterial road</a>s and highways. It is connected to <a href="North%20Beach%2C%20Western%20Australia">North Beach</a> (7 km), <a href="Scarborough%2C%20Western%20Australia">Scarborough</a> (10 km) and <a href="Perth%20Airport">Perth Airport</a> (22 km) via <a href="Reid%20Highway">Reid Highway</a>, to the Perth CBD (15 km) and to <a href="Joondalup">Joondalup</a> (17 km) via Reid Highway and <a href="Mitchell%20Freeway">Mitchell Freeway</a>, and to the Balcatta industrial area and Karrinyup Shopping Centre (7 km) by <a href="Erindale%20Road">Erindale Road</a>. Traffic within Hamersley is distributed by a number of backbone streets, of which the main ones are Eglinton Crescent, Belvedere Road, Rannoch Circle, Blissett Way and Vickers Street.

However, the <a href="limited-access%20road">controlled access highways</a> on Hamersley's southern and western boundaries physically isolate the suburb from its neighbours and limit southbound exits to just two, Erindale Road and Wanneroo Road. This results in considerable rush hour congestion on the stretch of Erindale Road between Eglinton Crescent and Reid Highway. In 2004, Main Roads Western Australia provided a grant of $48,000 to the City of Stirling under its Black Spot Programme to improve the traffic flow in this area.

Public transport in Hamersley is generally in the form of <a href="Transperth">Transperth</a> buses operated by <a href="Swan%20Transit">Swan Transit</a> from the <a href="Warwick%20railway%20station%2C%20Perth">Warwick railway station</a> at its northwestern corner, linking via the <a href="Joondalup%20railway%20line">Joondalup railway line</a> to the Perth <a href="central%20business%20district">CBD</a>.

At the 2011 census, the <a href="Australian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> reported that 13.9% of Hamersley's residents used public transport to get to work. This was a sizable jump from 8.5% in the 2006 census, and was higher than the north-western metropolitan average of 13.1%. Public transport usage was highest (16.8%) in the section of Hamersley closest to the train station, and lowest (8.3%) in the Vickers Street section to the southeast, where many residents live more than 10 minutes' walk from the nearest bus stop.

Currently, the only service in the suburb is the 387 daytime service between Warwick and <a href="Roe%20Street%20bus%20station">Perth</a> via Balcatta Road, which travels along Eglinton Crescent. Eastern Hamersley does not have a direct service, other than those along Erindale and Wanneroo Roads. However, service along Wanneroo Road is very limited outside standard weekday hours.

Originally, Hamersley was served by a shuttle service to Wanneroo Road, <a href="Nollamara%2C%20Western%20Australia">Nollamara</a>, to connect with other routes to the Perth CBD. In September 1973, the Metropolitan Transport Trust introduced the 358 and 359 services, which linked <a href="Greenwood%2C%20Western%20Australia">Greenwood</a> to Perth via Eglinton Crescent and Glendale Avenue/Aintree Street respectively, travelling along Blissett Way, then becoming limited-stops Wanneroo Road services. An after-hours service, the 369, was also introduced. In 1987, following the construction of the Warwick Transfer Station and the Mitchell Freeway, services along Glendale Avenue and through East Hamersley ceased, with two new routes – the 347 and the Freeway-bound 387 – being created to serve Eglinton Crescent.

On 21 March 1993, the Joondalup railway line came into operation as part of the <a href="Northern%20Suburbs%20Transit%20System">Northern Suburbs Transit System</a>, resulting in the creation of the 449 and 457 services to replace the 387 service. The 449 operated only during the morning and evening rush-hour, while the 457 operated after-hours and at weekends. These services operated virtually unchanged until 6 November 2011, when the 347 was replaced with the present-day 387, and the 457 and weekday evening services were withdrawn. On 31 January 2016, the 449 was also withdrawn, leaving Hamersley without weekend bus services.

Hamersley has consistently favoured the centre-right <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party</a> at both federal and state elections throughout its history. However, in the 2001 and 2005 state elections and at the 1983 federal election, Hamersley booths recorded a majority for the centre-left <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> (ALP). Hamersley has also shown a higher preference than the regional average for progressive minor parties such as the <a href="Australian%20Greens">Australian Greens</a> and <a href="Australian%20Democrats">Australian Democrats</a>. Hamersley is both socially and geographically between the safe Liberal suburbs west of the <a href="Mitchell%20Freeway">Mitchell Freeway</a> such as <a href="Carine%2C%20Western%20Australia">Carine</a>, <a href="Duncraig%2C%20Western%20Australia">Duncraig</a> and <a href="North%20Beach%2C%20Western%20Australia">North Beach</a>, and the safe Labor suburbs east of <a href="Wanneroo%20Road">Wanneroo Road</a> such as <a href="Balga%2C%20Western%20Australia">Balga</a> and <a href="Girrawheen%2C%20Western%20Australia">Girrawheen</a>.

At federal level, Hamersley is within the <a href="Division%20of%20Stirling">Division of Stirling</a>, a <a href="marginal%20seat">marginal seat</a> which historically has alternated between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party. It has been held since 2004 by Michael Keenan of the Liberal Party. At polling place and subdivision level, Hamersley has supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1972, the only exception being the 1983 election. In the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202001">2001 election</a>, the booth at East Hamersley Primary School was only won by the Liberal Party with a 0.3% two-party-preferred majority. Hamersley was in the <a href="Division%20of%20Cowan">Division of Cowan</a> for elections held between 1984 and 1996.

In the <a href="Western%20Australian%20Legislative%20Assembly">Western Australian Legislative Assembly</a>, Hamersley is split between the electorates of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Girrawheen">Girrawheen</a> and <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Balcatta">Balcatta</a>, ordinarily both safe seats for the Australian Labor Party. At polling place level, Hamersley supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1971 until the 1996 election. In both the 2001 and 2005 elections, polling places in Hamersley, as with those in many northern Perth suburbs, switched to the Australian Labor Party at state level. However, at the 2008 and 2013 elections, the suburb returned a majority for the Liberals.

At local level, Hamersley is represented within the <a href="City%20of%20Stirling">City of Stirling</a> by the two councillors of the Hamersley Ward, which covers the suburbs of Carine, Hamersley, Gwelup and northern Balcatta. At present, Samantha Jenkinson, whose term expires in October 2019, and Andrew Guilfoyle, whose term expires in October 2017, represent Hamersley Ward.

In the early 1970s, the Hamersley Progress Association was formed to represent the views of Hamersley residents to all levels of government. It was, however, fairly short-lived. In 1999, the Hamersley Reference Group was formed to advise then-Federal Member for Stirling <a href="Jann%20McFarlane">Jann McFarlane</a> MHR on issues related to the ABC radio transmission towers and their effect on local residents. It was renamed to Radio Interference Group – Hamersley Towers after it moved to complete community management, and lobbies the government and makes submissions to public inquiries on behalf of the community on the issue.

Polling place statistics are presented below combining the votes from the "Glendale" and "East Hamersley" polling places in the federal and state elections as indicated.

Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)

The Trump International Hotel and Tower is a skyscraper <a href="condo-hotel">condo-hotel</a> in downtown <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>. The building, named after businessman and current U.S. President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> was designed by architect <a href="Adrian%20Smith%20%28architect%29">Adrian Smith</a> of <a href="Skidmore%2C%20Owings%20and%20Merrill">Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a>. <a href="Bovis%20Lend%20Lease">Bovis Lend Lease</a> built the 98-story structure, which reaches a height of including its spire, its roof <a href="topping%20out">topping out</a> at . It is next to the main branch of the <a href="Chicago%20River">Chicago River</a>, with a view of the entry to <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> beyond a series of bridges over the river. The building received publicity when the winner of the <a href="The%20Apprentice%20%28U.S.%20Season%201%29">first season of "The Apprentice"</a> reality television show, <a href="Bill%20Rancic">Bill Rancic</a>, chose to manage the construction of the tower over managing a new Trump National Golf Course and resort in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>.

Trump announced in 2001 that the skyscraper would become the <a href="List%20of%20tallest%20buildings%20in%20the%20world">tallest building in the world</a>, but after the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> that same year, he scaled back the building's plans, and its design underwent several revisions. When topped out in 2009, it became the <a href="List%20of%20tallest%20buildings%20in%20the%20United%20States">fourth-tallest</a> building in the US. It surpassed the city's <a href="John%20Hancock%20Center">John Hancock Center</a> as the building with the highest residence (apartment or condo) in the world, and briefly held this title until the completion of the <a href="Burj%20Khalifa">Burj Khalifa</a>.

The design of the building includes, from the ground up, retail space, a parking garage, a hotel and <a href="condominium">condominium</a>s. The 339-room hotel opened for business with limited accommodations and services on January 30, 2008, then full accommodation and services on April 28. The building topped out in late 2008 and construction was completed in 2009. , the hotel is among three in Chicago with an elite <a href="hotel%20rating">five-star</a> <a href="Forbes%20Travel%20Guide">Forbes Travel Guide</a> rating. <a href="Sixteen%20%28Chicago%20restaurant%29">Sixteen</a> was one of five restaurants in Chicago with at least a <a href="Michelin%20Guide">Michelin Guide</a> two-star rating in 2016 and one of three five-star Forbes-rated restaurants in the city until it closed in 2018. The spa is one of six with at least a four-star Forbes rating in the Chicago area in 2015.

The tower sits at 401 North Wabash Avenue in the <a href="River%20North%20Gallery%20District%2C%20Near%20North%20Side%2C%20Chicago">River North Gallery District</a>, part of the <a href="Near%20North%20Side%2C%20Chicago">Near North Side</a> <a href="Community%20areas%20of%20Chicago">community area</a> of Chicago. The building occupies the site vacated by the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>", one of the city's two major newspapers, and its location within the River North Gallery District places it in a neighborhood that has had a high concentration of art galleries since the 1980s. The site, at the foot of <a href="Rush%20Street%20%28Chicago%29">Rush Street</a>, is on the north side of the <a href="Chicago%20River">Chicago River</a> just west of the <a href="Wrigley%20Building">Wrigley Building</a> and the <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20Bridge">Michigan Avenue Bridge</a>, and just east of <a href="Marina%20City">Marina City</a> and <a href="330%20North%20Wabash">330 North Wabash</a>. The building is close to numerous <a href="Chicago%20landmarks">Chicago landmarks</a>; it borders the <a href="Michigan-Wacker%20District">Michigan-Wacker District</a>, which is a Registered Historic District. Parts of the building are visible throughout the city, and the entire length of the building is visible from boats on the river, as well as from locations to the east along the river, such as the mouth of <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>, the <a href="Lake%20Shore%20Drive">Lake Shore Drive</a> Overpass, and the <a href="Columbus%20Drive%20%28Chicago%29">Columbus Drive</a> Bridge.

The building is across the Chicago River from the <a href="Chicago%20Loop">Chicago Loop</a>, the city's <a href="business%20district">business district</a>. It is a block away from the southern end of the <a href="Magnificent%20Mile">Magnificent Mile</a> portion of <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29">Michigan Avenue</a>. The restaurant, Terrace 16, has a clear view of the Chicago River's entrance to Lake Michigan and of the four buildings completed in the 1920s that flank the Michigan Avenue Bridge (Wrigley Building, <a href="Tribune%20Tower">Tribune Tower</a>, <a href="333%20North%20Michigan">333 North Michigan</a>, and <a href="360%20North%20Michigan">360 North Michigan</a>).

The design of the building incorporates three <a href="Setback%20%28architecture%29">setback features</a> designed to provide visual continuity with the surrounding skyline, each reflecting the height of a nearby building. The first setback, on the east side of the building, aligns with the <a href="cornice">cornice</a> line of the Wrigley Building to the east; the second, on the west side, aligns with <a href="River%20Plaza%20%28skyscraper%29">River Plaza</a> to the north and with the Marina City Towers to the west. The third setback, on the east side, relates to 330 North Wabash building (formerly known as IBM Plaza). However, some views distort the alignment of the second setback. The setbacks and rounded edges of the building combat <a href="vortex">vortex</a> formation. The body of the building is raised above the main Wabash entrance and above the Chicago River. The building's <a href="Permasteelisa">Permasteelisa</a> <a href="curtain%20wall%20%28architecture%29">curtain wall</a> uses clear <a href="emissivity">low-emissivity</a> coated glass and a curved wing-shaped polished stainless-steel <a href="mullion">mullion</a> system that projects from the glass line. It incorporates brushed stainless steel <a href="spandrel">spandrel</a> panels and clear <a href="anodized%20aluminum">anodized aluminum</a>.

The building has of floor space, rises to 98 stories, and houses 486 luxury residential condominiums. These include studio apartments, a mixture of suites with one to four bedrooms, and five-bedroom penthouses. The tower also features a luxury hotel condominium with 339 guest rooms. The building includes, from the ground up, retail space, a parking garage, a hotel, and condominiums. The 3rd through 12th floors house lobbies, retail space, and the parking garage; the 14th floor and its <a href="mezzanine">mezzanine</a> hosts a health club and spa. The 17th floor through the 27th-floor mezzanine contain hotel condominiums and executive lounges. The 28th through 85th floors have residential condominiums, and the 86th through 89th floors have penthouses. A riverfront park and riverwalk, along a space in the area adjacent to the building to the east, was opened in the first half of 2010. The park facilitates public assembly and entertainment activity while linking the building effectively with river commuters.
In 2011, the riverfront park landscaping surrounding the building, which is referred to as Trump Plaza and Riverwalk or sometimes just Trump Plaza, became the subject of controversy. In 2010, the Plaza had earned special recognition at the <a href="Chicago%20Mayor">Mayor</a> <a href="Richard%20M.%20Daley">Daley</a>'s Landscape Awards. The press release noted the landscaping "for their magnificent new civic landscape that is a poetic interpretation of native Illinois that seems at once sophisticated and familiar." However, in 2011, the award-winning plantings of small <a href="sumac">sumac</a> trees, <a href="fern">fern</a>s and native grasses with yellow, orange and red hues were removed and replaced with evergreens like <a href="juniper">juniper</a>s and <a href="Boxwood%20%28genus%29">boxwoods</a>, pieces of gray stone, and purple perennials (<a href="catmint">catmint</a> and <a href="salvia">salvia</a>), which may require less watering. To add to the controversy, the planting was accompanied by a plan to light the trees to attract nighttime park visitors, in conflict with the "dark skies" movement to reduce <a href="light%20pollution">light pollution</a> to facilitate better <a href="stargazing">stargazing</a>.

The building broke the record for the world's highest residence above ground level, held since 1969 by the nearby John Hancock Center. Because the Trump Tower has both hotel condominiums and residential condominiums, it does not contest the record held by the 88-story <a href="432%20Park%20Avenue">432 Park Avenue</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, which, at , is the tallest residential building in the world.

The Trump International Hotel and Tower rises from the building's main entrance on <a href="Wabash%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29">Wabash Avenue</a> to the tip of the architectural spire. Upon its completion in 2009, the building became the <a href="List%20of%20tallest%20buildings%20in%20the%20world">seventh-tallest building in the world</a>, behind the <a href="Jin%20Mao%20Tower">Jin Mao Tower</a> in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. On November 17, 2009, however, the <a href="Council%20on%20Tall%20Buildings%20and%20Urban%20Habitat">Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat</a> (CTBUH), which composes rankings of the tallest skyscrapers in the world based on various criteria, changed its standard for measuring a building's height. Prior to this change, a building's architectural height was calculated from the main entrance to the tip of the spire; new standards measured from the lowest open-air pedestrian level of a building. As the Trump International Hotel and Tower has a riverwalk entrance and pedestrian level below the building's Wabash Avenue entrance, the skyscraper's official height was recalculated as without a physical addition to the structure. According to the CTBUH, the recalculated height also made the tower the sixth-tallest building in the world, surpassing the <a href="Jin%20Mao%20Tower">Jin Mao Tower</a> by . In January 2010, the building moved back to its position as seventh-tallest with the opening of the <a href="Burj%20Khalifa">Burj Khalifa</a> in <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a>.

According to Trump, he received approval for a sign from <a href="Chicago%20Mayor">Chicago Mayor</a> <a href="Richard%20M.%20Daley">Richard M. Daley</a>'s administration in 2009, but renegotiated with Mayor <a href="Rahm%20Emanuel">Rahm Emanuel</a>'s administration. In October 2013, Trump received approval to erect tall stainless steel letters back-lit with white <a href="LED">LED</a> lighting spelling out TRUMP on the 16th floor of the building. He made his impending plans for the sign public in February 2014. According to a city planning department spokesperson, standard protocol for such a sign is to require approval from the local <a href="alderman">alderman</a> (Brendan Reilly, 42nd ward) and the full <a href="Chicago%20City%20Council">Chicago City Council</a>. The five letters span a width of approximately , making the final approved version approximately — according to some sources—rather than the originally proposed size. The sign is located about above ground level.

Crews began hanging the sign in May 2014. When "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" architecture critic Kamin warned Trump that his review of the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded "As time passes, it'll be like the <a href="Hollywood%20Sign">Hollywood Sign</a>"; architect Smith distanced himself from the sign saying "Just for the record, I had nothing to do with this sign!" The controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> ran a story about Mayor Emanuel's disapproval in mid-June. According to the Mayor's spokeswoman Kelley Quinn, "Mayor Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign". Kamin has noted that part of the problem is the architectural traditions of the city: "If this sign was in <a href="Atlantic%20City">Atlantic City</a> or <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, nobody would care—but it is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward". Trump and Reilly both pointed out how unbecoming the prior "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" building signage was. As a result of the fiasco, Emanuel initiated a study on how to alter the rules to avert similar signage controversies in the future. A Chicago-based design firm planned to create and float four giant pig balloons in front of the sign as a protest, but were unsuccessful getting <a href="US%20Coast%20Guard">US Coast Guard</a> and <a href="Chicago%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Chicago Department of Transportation</a> approvals.

According to the "2010 City Guide: Chicago" edition of the "<a href="Forbes%20Travel%20Guide">Forbes Travel Guide</a>", the building hosts one of the seven four-star restaurants in the city and one of the three four-star spas. The hotel is one of two four star hotels. In 2010 Chicago had two five-star hotels and two five-star restaurants. By the time of the "Forbes Travel Guide": 2013 City Guide, the hotel and restaurant were each among only three five-star ratings in the city. It retained this ranking in the 2015 Forbes Guide (along with hotels <a href="The%20Peninsula%20Chicago">The Peninsula</a> and <a href="Four%20Seasons%20Hotel%20Chicago">Four Seasons</a> and with restaurants <a href="Alinea%20%28restaurant%29">Alinea</a> and <a href="Grace%20%28restaurant%29">Grace</a>). The spa was among 6 four- or five-star Forbes-rated spas in the Chicago area in 2015.

The restaurant was promoted to two-star rating by the <a href="Michelin%20Guide">Michelin Guide</a> for 2014 and retained that rating in 2015. It was one of 5 Chicago restaurants to achieve at least a two-star Michelin rating in both years. In 2016, it again retained its two-star rating as one of five restaurants in the city with such a rating.

The original plan was to have a partial opening of three of the hotel's floors on December 3, 2007, with a grand opening to follow. The interim ceremony, however, was delayed until January 30, 2008, while the City of Chicago granted occupancy approval for the staff of the hotel in the first 27 floors. Four floors of guest rooms were opened, comprising 125 of the planned 339 rooms. By January 30, construction on the exterior of the building had passed the 53rd floor. The grand opening of the hotel, including amenities, originally scheduled for March 17, 2008, took place on April 28, 2008. <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer-Prize</a>-winning "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" architecture critic <a href="Blair%20Kamin">Blair Kamin</a> faults the <a href="zebrawood">zebrawood</a> paneling in the hotel lobby, but another "Tribune" reporter praises the hotel for its "understated, contemporary look, distinguished by stunning views".

On the 16th floor, a restaurant named <a href="Sixteen%20%28restaurant%29">Sixteen</a> opened in early February 2008, and an outdoor patio terrace, named The Terrace at Trump, opened on June 25, 2009 following the completion of construction. The restaurant opened to favorable reviews for its cuisine, decor, location, architecture, and view. Sixteen, which was designed by Joe Valerio, is described architecturally as a sequence of spaces that do not reveal themselves at once, but rather in "procession". The restaurant's foyer is T-shaped, and a passageway to the hotel is lined with floor-to-ceiling architectural bronze wine racks in opposing red and white wine rooms. The passageway leads to views—praised by Kamin—that showcase the Wrigley Building <a href="clock%20tower">clock tower</a> and the Tribune Tower's <a href="flying%20buttresses">flying buttresses</a>. Kamin notes that these views are "more intimate" than the panoramic ones of the Signature Room, a restaurant near the top of the Hancock Center. The views are described as equally impressive by day and by night. The main part of the procession is the Tower Room, a dining room with a dome-shaped ceiling made of West African wood. The dome is furnished with <a href="Swarovski">Swarovski</a> chandeliers and incorporates mirrors so that all diners can experience the view.

The Terrace, which opened on June 25, 2009, has views of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan as well as <a href="Navy%20Pier">Navy Pier</a>'s seasonal Wednesday and Saturday evening fireworks, and was designed for outdoor or <a href="al%20fresco%20dining">"al fresco"</a> dining.

Located on the mezzanine level, Rebar—the hotel bar—opened on April 18, 2008.

On June 5, 2018, it was announced that Terrace 16 Restaurant & Bar would replace Sixteen. The newly themed dining space was expected to debut during the summer of 2018.

The spa, named The Spa at Trump, opened in late March 2008. The spa offers <a href="gemstone">gemstone</a>-infused (diamond, ruby, or sapphire) oil massages, hydrating masques, <a href="Exfoliation%20%28cosmetology%29">exfoliating salts</a> and the "Deluge shower". The spa features a health club with an indoor pool, eleven treatment rooms, a private couples treatment suite, Swiss shower, and saunas. The <a href="Citysearch">Citysearch</a> editorial review described this as the "Bentley of hotel spas". A "Chicago Tribune" critic spoke of the spa in positive terms for both the treatment and the physical spa itself. The Spa at Trump can be accessed from a large circular staircase inside the hotel, enabling its customers to access the facility from specially designed spa guest rooms without using the elevator.

In July 2001, when Donald Trump announced plans for the site of the former seven-story Sun-Times Building, the tower was expected to reach a height of , which would have made it the world's tallest building. It was expected to contain between of floor space and cost about $77 million just for the property rights. Three architectural firms were considered: Lohan Associates, <a href="Kohn%20Pedersen%20Fox%20Associates">Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates</a>, and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill; Trump selected Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in August 2001. Adrian Smith, who had previously designed the <a href="Jin%20Mao%20Tower">Jin Mao Tower</a>, headed the SOM team, giving Chicago a third skyscraper from the same firm which had previously designed the Willis Tower and the Hancock Center.

After the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">terrorist acts of September 11, 2001</a>, Trump reduced the planned height to 78 stories and , to reduce the risk of similar attacks. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine reported that a meeting between Smith and Trump about erecting the tallest building in Chicago was taking place at the actual time of the attacks. Some international news sources later claimed that the planned tower height was reduced to after the original plans called for a 150-story building that would reach . These claims are supported by computer renderings from 1999 of the proposed skyscraper, shown in the "Chicago Tribune" in 2005.

The building's design was first released in December 2001. However, the first design did not meet with approval from other architects, or from the residents of Chicago. A subsequent revision in July 2002 resulted in an 86-floor design for use as an office and residential structure, similar to the 2006 design which is, however, for a different combination of uses. Smith's 2002 plans put broadcast <a href="Antenna%20%28radio%29">antennas</a> (multiple communications <a href="satellite%20dish">dishes</a>) at the top of the building. A revised 90-story, plan was unveiled in September 2003 for a building including condominiums, office space, a "condominium hotel", retail stores, and restaurants. In January 2004, another revision changed floors 17 through 26 from offices into condominiums and hotel rooms. In his May 2004 plan, Smith decided to top the building with an ornamental spire instead of communications dishes. These dishes, according to the <a href="Council%20on%20Tall%20Buildings%20and%20Urban%20Habitat">Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat</a>, would not have counted toward the building's height. The spire, however, will count, raising the tower's height to . At one point in 2005, Trump aspired to build a slightly taller building that would surpass the Sears Tower as the nation's tallest building, but <a href="Chicago%20Mayor">Chicago Mayor</a> <a href="Richard%20M.%20Daley">Richard M. Daley</a> was against the plan. Eventually, Smith settled on a design with a height of , which was the height of <a href="2%20World%20Trade%20Center">2 World Trade Center</a>, the shorter of the former twin World Trade Center towers. This height makes the Tower the third tallest in the United States after One World Trade Center and the Willis Tower.

On October 16, 2004, Donald Trump and <a href="Hollinger%20International">Hollinger International</a>, the parent company of the "Chicago Sun-Times", completed the $73 million sale of the former home of the newspaper a week after it relocated. On October 28, 2004, Trump held a ceremony to begin the demolition of the former Sun-Times Building. The demolition and construction were financed by a $650 million loan from <a href="Deutsche%20Bank">Deutsche Bank</a> and a trio of <a href="hedge%20fund">hedge fund</a>s, one of which <a href="George%20Soros">George Soros</a> backed.
In March 2005, the construction process began with the sinking of the first <a href="Caisson%20%28engineering%29">caisson</a> for the tower into the <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a>. In April, construction began on the <a href="Foundation%20%28engineering%29">foundation</a> below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the <a href="Wabash%20Avenue%20Bridge">Wabash Avenue Bridge</a>. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, they drove a steel plate next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.

Within a single 24-hour period in October 2005, a fleet of 30 concrete trucks made 600 trips to pour of concrete, and thus create a 200-by-66-by-10-foot (61.0 m × 20.1 m × 3.0 m) concrete "mat". The mat serves as the base of the building, from which its spine rises. Those involved with the construction referred to the day as the "Big Pour". <a href="James%20McHugh%20Construction%20Co.">James McHugh Construction Co.</a> was contracted for the concrete work on this job. They obtained the concrete from the <a href="Chicago%20Avenue">Chicago Avenue</a> and <a href="Halsted%20Street">Halsted Street</a> distribution site of Prairie Material Sales Inc of <a href="Bridgeview%2C%20Illinois">Bridgeview, Illinois</a>, the former largest privately owned <a href="ready-mix%20concrete">ready-mix concrete</a> company in the United States. Prairie used a formula of concrete that had never been used in the construction business to meet a specification, which exceeded the standard for conventional concrete.

In October 2006, controversy erupted over a street kiosk at the foot of the Magnificent Mile in front of the Wrigley Building at 410 North Michigan Avenue that advertised Trump Tower a full block away. Extensive debate and publicity occurred on the issue of whether such advertising should have been allowed. Two distinct pieces of legislation in 2002 and 2003 by the <a href="Chicago%20City%20Council">Chicago City Council</a> had authorized the kiosk, but sidewalk billboards were not common in Chicago at the time, and their desirability was questioned. Although there were demands from citizens' organizations and the local Alderman <a href="Burton%20Natarus">Burton Natarus</a> (who had voted in favor of the legislation) to remove the kiosk, Trump agreed only to remove pricing information from the signage, after a request to remove all advertising from it. Originally, one side displayed the geographical information and the other side functioned as a billboard.

In a separate legal development, Donald Trump was sued by former "Chicago Sun-Times" publisher <a href="David%20Radler">F. David Radler</a> and his daughters in February 2008 for rescinding all "friends and family" condominium purchases, including Radler's. As president of the "Sun-Times" holding company, Radler had negotiated the sale of the paper's headquarters building to Trump's consortium. The price of Radler's condo had been discounted by 10%, and only a 5% deposit was required instead of the standard 15%. Radler and family were part of a group of 40 insiders who were able to purchase property at about . When the market value of the property eventually rose to over , Trump nullified the "friends and family" sales. The insiders were involved in the planning and designing of the building. In January 2007, Trump cited both a clause about "matters beyond [the] seller's reasonable control" and the desire to "have more income to handle potentially higher construction costs". Despite Trump's concerns about higher construction costs, earlier in the same month, <a href="Ivanka%20Trump">Ivanka Trump</a>, his daughter and an executive of the company, had stated that the construction was $50 million under budget. In addition to the Radler suit over the validity of the "friends and family" discount contracts, a group of four owners sued over revisions to the closing terms, which placed limits on the owner occupancy of condo hotel units and excluded the meeting rooms and ballrooms from the common elements of which the owners have an interest.
In an additional legal issue, on February 8, 2005, Trump had closed on a construction loan of $640 million from <a href="Deutsche%20Bank">Deutsche Bank</a> for the project. He also obtained a $130–135 million junior <a href="mezzanine%20loan">mezzanine loan</a> from another syndicate headed by <a href="Fortress%20Investment%20Group">Fortress Investment Group</a>. As part of these contracts, Trump had included a $40 million personal guarantee. The contracts also mandated partial repayments for each closed unit sale, and minimum sale prices. In September 2008, due to slow unit sales, Trump sought to extend both loans until mid-2009 because he felt that it was necessary in the business environment and expected from the outset of the contract. On November 10, Deutsche Bank demanded the outstanding loan payment and the $40 million guarantee. Trump filed suit later that month against Deutsche Bank in <a href="New%20York%20State%20Supreme%20Court">New York State Supreme Court</a> in an effort to excuse a repayment of more than $330 million that had been due November 7, and to extend the construction loan for an unspecified period of time because of extenuating circumstances arising from the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932010">financial crisis of 2007–2010</a>. Trump cited a "<a href="force%20majeure">force majeure</a>" clause that allowed the borrower to delay completion of the project under a catch-all section covering "any other event or circumstance not within the reasonable control of the borrower". Trump not only sought an extension, but sought damages of $3 billion from the bank for its use of <a href="predatory%20lending">predatory lending</a> practices to undermine the project and damage his reputation, which he claimed "is associated worldwide with on-time, under-budget, first-class construction projects and first-class luxury hotel operations." At the end of November, Deutsche Bank countersued Trump to force him to uphold his personal payment guarantee from February 2005, after he failed to repay the amount due November 7—a date that already had been extended. The suits did not interfere with Trump's ability to continue drawing on the credit line provided by Deutsche Bank, because without the project's continued financing, Deutsche Bank may have had to assume the role of developer. In March 2009, both parties agreed to suspend litigation and resolve the disagreement amicably in an effort to help the project to succeed. In September 2010, an amended loan agreement stopped the litigation and extended the term on an approximately $600 million construction loan for five years.

<a href="Bill%20Rancic">Bill Rancic</a>, <a href="The%20Apprentice%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">"The Apprentice"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s</a> season one winner in 2004, was originally hired to manage the project for a $250,000 salary. Rancic's title was President of the Trump International Hotel and Tower, but the title was somewhat misleading, because he was in fact learning on the job as an "Apprentice." Rancic's contract was renewed after his first year, but in September 2005 it appeared that his employment with Trump would finish at the end of his second year in April 2006. During 2005 <a href="Donald%20Trump%2C%20Jr.">Donald Trump, Jr.</a>, who had been involved in the building since its earliest stages in 1999, was overseeing the construction with weekly visits, while Rancic worked on sales and marketing. In December 2005, Rancic made it clear that he wanted to continue working for Trump, and in April 2006 his contract was renewed for a third year. In that year Donald Trump's children began to assume prominent public roles as in the <a href="Trump%20Organization">Trump Organization</a>; by January 2007 all three adult Trump children (<a href="Ivanka%20Trump">Ivanka Trump</a>, Donald Trump, Jr., and <a href="Eric%20Trump">Eric Trump</a>) were executives in the acquisitions and development division of the organization. By the time the Chicago Trump Tower's hotel opened in the building in January 2008, Donald Trump and his three adult children were in the spotlight, overseeing the construction.

<a href="Bovis%20Lend%20Lease">Bovis Lend Lease</a>, noted for work on <a href="Disneyland%20Paris">Disneyland Paris</a>, <a href="Petronas%20Towers">Petronas Towers</a>, and the <a href="Time%20Warner%20Center">Time Warner Center</a>, was the construction company. James McHugh Construction Co, the concrete subcontractor, implemented a comprehensive <a href="formwork">formwork</a> for the construction of the building. At the completion of construction the building was the tallest formwork structure in the world, and follows in the footsteps of its neighbor, <a href="Marina%20City">Marina City</a>, as well as Chicago's <a href="Two%20Prudential%20Plaza">Two Prudential Plaza</a>, as past recordholders. Concrete moulding was used, because using a traditional ironwork structure would have required a building footprint that would have been too big for the property size, proportional to the height of the designed building. A steel frame would have had to be wider to have supported a building of this proportion. Concrete will counteract the force of wind with the force of gravity of the building. A new chemical process that leveraged more fluid liquid concrete facilitated pumping concrete up several hundred feet to the elevating construction site. Although previous technology limited formwork to , this technology permitted the pumping of concrete high.

The building is <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a>ed into a section of 420 million-year-old <a href="limestone">limestone</a> <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a> underground. It uses -wide <a href="Stilts%20%28architecture%29">stilt</a>-like pillars that were drilled beneath the building. Every around its perimeter, steel-reinforced concrete was poured into these holes to form the structural support. On top of these <a href="Caisson%20%28engineering%29">caisson</a> shafts and pillars, an concrete pad <a href="Foundation%20%28engineering%29">foundation</a> was built to support the building's spine. The building has 241 caissons, and the majority of the caissons only descend into hard clay. However, 57 of them go an additional into the ground, including of bedrock. The concrete spine uses five <a href="I-beam">I-beam</a>-shaped walls and exterior columns, narrowing to two as the building rises. Each floor is separated by a <a href="concrete%20slab">concrete slab</a>, and stainless steel, glass, and aluminum panels are attached to each floor. of reinforcing steel bars, called <a href="rebar">rebar</a>, support the hotel. The extensive use of concrete makes the building more <a href="fireproof">fireproof</a>. Of the $600 million construction budget, $130 million was earmarked for the James McHugh Construction Co, who handled the concrete-only portion of the job.

Two earlier business decisions by the "Chicago Sun-Times" led to substantial savings of time and money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s <a href="sea%20wall">sea wall</a> was built by the newspaper company to <a href="bomb%20shelter">bomb-shelter</a> thickness, to withstand a <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> attack, and thus did not have to be broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.

On August 16, 2008, construction crews made the last major concrete pour to top off the Trump tower's concrete core, which was commemorated with an unofficial ceremony. To celebrate the milestone, a yellow tower crane raised a bucket full of concrete and an American flag to the rooftop of the skyscraper. Another ceremony occurred on August 19, when construction supervisors, structural engineers and company representatives from McHugh Construction made a minor concrete pour at the top of the Trump tower. Although Donald Trump was absent from both of these ceremonies, he, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump attended the topping off party on September 24, 2008. Original plans called for the windows to be completed and the spire erected in October 2008. However, the spire installation was delayed through high winds in December 2008, and was finally completed on January 3, 2009. Kamin's critical opinion is that the spire is not aesthetically complementary.

At the September 2008 topping off ceremony, Donald Trump marketed his hotel by expressing doubts about the <a href="Chicago%20Spire">Chicago Spire</a> ever being completed due to the financial crisis of 2007–2009. However, Donald Jr. said that they were fortunate to complete the project, while the Spire and <a href="Waterview%20Tower">Waterview Tower</a> were among developments hit by the economic slowdown that followed the financial crisis. Occupancy had begun on lower-floor condominiums at the time of the ceremony.

Residents of the Trump building are zoned to <a href="Chicago%20Public%20Schools">Chicago Public Schools</a>, more specifically to Ogden School and <a href="Wells%20Community%20Academy%20High%20School">Wells Community Academy High School</a>.

Trump's hotel was 25% unsold at the time of the 2008 topping off ceremony, and was expected to need the mid-2009 construction loan extension that has caused legal complications. Trump had sold all but 36 of the building's 486 residential condos at the end of 2012, and 15 remained unsold at the end of 2013. By May 15, 2014 only six units remained for sale including three that were used as the sales center and sales models.

Several local celebrities purchased units in the building, including numerous professional athletes and artists. <a href="Juwan%20Howard">Juwan Howard</a>, <a href="Rex%20Grossman">Rex Grossman</a> (who has put his unit on the market), <a href="Patrick%20Kane">Patrick Kane</a> and <a href="R.%20Kelly">R. Kelly</a> are among the purchasers of Trump properties. <a href="Derrick%20Rose">Derrick Rose</a> purchased a $2.8 million condo in spring 2012. Other prominent purchasers of units included <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> Chief Executive and President <a href="Don%20Thompson%20%28executive%29">Don Thompson</a> and <a href="WMAQ-TV">WMAQ-TV</a> (NBC 5 Chicago) president and general manager David Doebler. <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> CEO Jeff Smisek and <a href="Huron%20Consulting%20Group">Huron Consulting Group</a> CEO James Roth also purchased properties in the building.

Two units on the 87th and 88th floors sold for prices in excess of $5 million in 2009 directly from the developer. After a few soft years in the real estate market, it took until August 2014, for units to sell for prices in excess of $1000 per square foot. Two units sold for over $3 million that month including a $3.99 million sale, which was the highest sale price in the building since 2009. The penthouse sold for $17 million in late 2014 to Sanjay Shah, the founder and CEO of <a href="Vistex">Vistex</a>.

In May 2016, a one-bedroom unit with a parking space became the first listed Chicago one-bedroom unit to fetch over $1,100-a-square-foot when Mark and Deborah Hellman moved their interests from a one-bedroom to a two-bedroom unit in the building. Overall, however, real estate observers noticed a slowdown in Trump Tower sales due to the controversial nature of the <a href="Donald%20Trump%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202016">Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016</a>: prospective buyers who were happy with the actual tower residences were unsure they wanted to be associated with the Trump name.

In February after one round of drink service, three men were denied further service at <a href="Sixteen%20%28Chicago%20restaurant%29">Sixteen</a> due to their apparent intoxication and as a payback, the three pulled what was intended to be a prank. They set off fire alarms and opened a fifth-floor stairwell <a href="Chicago%20Fire%20Department">Chicago Fire Department</a> <a href="Standpipe%20%28firefighting%29">standpipe</a> valve and flooded <a href="elevator%20shaft">elevator shaft</a>s with thousands of gallons of water and damaged woodwork, electrical circuitry and marble. The resulting damage was estimated at $700,000 and the three faced felony criminal damage to property charges.

On June 26, a pipe burst near the west public parking entrance, causing the first floor of the tower to flood.

"<a href="Fodor%27s">Fodor's</a> Chicago 2010" ranks the hotel as having one of the best spas and one of the best pools in the city. It also ranked the hotel as a Fodor's Choice among Chicago lodging options. "Fodor's" also notes that the hotel has impeccable service and lavish amenities, but also notes that the hotel may be a bit "too decadent", with offerings such as $25 bottles of water.

"<a href="Frommer%27s">Frommer's</a> Chicago 2010" describes the hotel as having the gorgeous views and upscale amenities to provide a place to go to live the life of a wealthy tourist. The building is praised for its location, which provides as many views along the Chicago River as possible. Its modern architecture is praised for "contemporary synthesis of adjacent building fabrics and modulations" that preserve the city's architectural heritage and integrate the riverfront setting.

"<a href="BlackBook%20Magazine">BlackBook Magazine</a>"s Guide to Chicago describes the Hotel as an embodiment of poshness which gives the visitor bragging rights upon his/her return home.

"<a href="Forbes%20Travel%20Guide">Forbes Travel Guide</a>" describes the hotel as having an understated upscale lobby, sophisticated lounge, gorgeous restaurant and lavish rooms with amazing views. It also describes the hotel as befitting of the Trump name in several ways.

"<a href="Time%20Out%20%28company%29">Time Out</a>" describes the building as a "testament to a vibrant 21st-century optimism in Chicago". It notes that the hotel meets all expectations attached to the name Trump in terms of luxury, modern conveniences and speaks highly of the views.

"<a href="Insight%20Guides">Insight Guides</a>" describes the building's architectural <a href="wikt%3Aswagger">swagger</a> as fitting for the post-<a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> skyline.

Kamin clarified his belief:

The building's planning and redesign led to publicity in local and national media both before and during its construction. For example, on September 19, 2007, the Trump International Hotel and Tower was featured on an episode of the <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Channel</a> series "<a href="Build%20It%20Bigger">Build It Bigger</a>" titled "High Risk Tower".

1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens

On May 18, 1980, a major <a href="volcanic%20eruption">volcanic eruption</a> occurred at <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a>, a volcano located in <a href="Skamania%20County%2C%20Washington">Skamania County</a>, in the <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">U.S. state of Washington</a>. The eruption (a <a href="Volcanic%20Explosivity%20Index">VEI 5</a> event) was the most significant volcanic eruption to occur in the <a href="Contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous</a> 48 U.S. states since the much smaller 1915 eruption of <a href="Lassen%20Peak">Lassen Peak</a> in California. It has often been declared as the most disastrous volcanic eruption in U.S. history. The eruption was preceded by a two-month series of earthquakes and <a href="steam">steam</a>-venting episodes, caused by an injection of <a href="magma">magma</a> at shallow depth below the volcano that created a large bulge and a fracture system on the mountain's north slope.

An earthquake at 8:32:17 a.m. <a href="Pacific%20Daylight%20Time">PDT</a> (<a href="UTC">UTC</a>−7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, caused the entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and <a href="steam">steam</a>-rich <a href="rock%20%28geology%29">rock</a> in the volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward <a href="Spirit%20Lake%20%28Washington%29">Spirit Lake</a> in a hot mix of <a href="lava">lava</a> and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.

An <a href="eruption%20column">eruption column</a> rose into the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmosphere</a> and deposited ash in 11 U.S. states. At the same time, snow, ice and several entire <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s on the volcano melted, forming a series of large <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s (volcanic <a href="mudslide">mudslide</a>s) that reached as far as the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, nearly to the southwest. Less severe outbursts continued into the next day, only to be followed by other large, but not as destructive, eruptions later that year. Thermal energy released during the eruption was equal to 26 megatons.

Approximately 57 people were killed directly, including innkeeper <a href="Harry%20R.%20Truman">Harry R. Truman</a>, photographers <a href="Reid%20Blackburn">Reid Blackburn</a> and <a href="Robert%20Landsburg">Robert Landsburg</a>, and geologist <a href="David%20A.%20Johnston">David A. Johnston</a>. Hundreds of square miles were reduced to wasteland, causing over $1 billion in damage (equivalent to $ billion today), thousands of animals were killed, and Mount St. Helens was left with a crater on its north side. At the time of the eruption, the summit of the volcano was owned by the <a href="Burlington%20Northern%20Railroad">Burlington Northern Railroad</a>, but afterward the land passed to the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a>. The area was later preserved, as it was, in the <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens%20National%20Volcanic%20Monument">Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument</a>.

Mount St. Helens remained dormant from its last period of activity in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. Several small earthquakes, beginning on March 15, indicated that <a href="magma">magma</a> may have begun moving below the <a href="volcano">volcano</a>. On March 20, at 3:45 p.m. <a href="Pacific%20Standard%20Time">Pacific Standard Time</a> (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake centered below the volcano's north flank, signaled the volcano's violent return from 123 years of hibernation. A gradually building <a href="earthquake%20swarm">earthquake swarm</a> saturated area <a href="seismograph">seismograph</a>s and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels in the next two days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale. A total of 174 shocks of magnitude 2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days.
Shocks of magnitude 3.2 or greater occurred at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude 4 or above per day in early April, and eight per day the week before May 18. Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced <a href="avalanche">avalanche</a>s of snow and ice were reported from aerial observations.

At 12:36 p.m. on March 27, <a href="phreatic%20eruption">phreatic eruption</a>s (explosions of <a href="steam">steam</a> caused by magma suddenly heating <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a>) ejected and smashed rock from within the old summit <a href="volcanic%20crater">crater</a>, excavating a new crater and sending an ash column about into the air. By this date a eastward-trending fracture system had also developed across the summit area. This was followed by more earthquake swarms and a series of steam explosions that sent ash above their vent. Most of this ash fell between from its vent, but some was carried south to <a href="Bend%2C%20Oregon">Bend, Oregon</a>, or east to <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane, Washington</a>.
A second, new crater and a blue flame were observed on March 29. The flame was visibly emitted from both craters and was probably created by burning gases. <a href="Static%20electricity">Static electricity</a> generated from ash clouds rolling down the volcano sent out <a href="lightning">lightning</a> bolts that were up to long. Ninety-three separate outbursts were reported on March 30, and increasingly strong <a href="harmonic%20tremor">harmonic tremor</a>s were first detected on April 1, alarming geologists and prompting Governor <a href="Dixy%20Lee%20Ray">Dixy Lee Ray</a> to declare a state of emergency on April 3. Governor Ray issued an executive order on April 30 creating a "red zone" around the volcano; anyone caught in this zone without a pass faced a $500 fine (equivalent to $ today) or six months in jail. This precluded many cabin owners from visiting their property.

By April 7, the combined crater was and deep. A <a href="USGS">USGS</a> team determined in the last week of April that a section of St. Helens' north face was displaced outward by at least . For the rest of April and early May this bulge grew by per day, and by mid-May it extended more than north. As the bulge moved northward, the summit area behind it progressively sank, forming a complex, down-dropped block called a <a href="graben">graben</a>. Geologists announced on April 30 that sliding of the bulge area was the greatest immediate danger and that such a <a href="landslide">landslide</a> might spark an eruption. These changes in the volcano's shape were related to the overall deformation that increased the volume of the volcano by by mid-May. This volume increase presumably corresponded to the volume of magma that pushed into the volcano and deformed its surface. Because the intruded magma remained below ground and was not directly visible, it was called a <a href="cryptodome">cryptodome</a>, in contrast to a true <a href="lava%20dome">lava dome</a> exposed at the surface.

On May 7, eruptions similar to those in March and April resumed, and over the next days the bulge approached its maximum size. All activity had been confined to the 350-year-old summit dome and did not involve any new magma. A total of about 10,000 earthquakes were recorded prior to the May 18 event, with most concentrated in a small zone less than directly below the bulge. Visible eruptions ceased on May 16, reducing public interest and consequently the number of spectators in the area. Mounting public pressure then forced officials to allow 50 carloads of property owners to enter the danger zone on Saturday, May 17, to gather whatever property they could carry. Another trip was scheduled for 10 a.m. the next day, and because that was Sunday, more than 300 loggers who would normally be working in the area were not there. By the time of the climactic eruption, <a href="dacite">dacite</a> magma intruding into the volcano had forced the north flank outward nearly and heated the volcano's <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> system, causing many steam-driven explosions (phreatic eruptions).

As May 18 dawned, Mount St. Helens' activity did not show any change from the pattern of the preceding month. The rate of bulge movement, <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> emission, and ground temperature readings did not reveal any changes indicating a catastrophic eruption. USGS <a href="volcanology">volcanologist</a> <a href="David%20A.%20Johnston">David A. Johnston</a> was on duty at an observation post approximately north of the volcano: as of 6:00 a.m., Johnston's measurements did not indicate any unusual activity.

At 8:32 a.m., a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope triggered that part of the volcano to slide, approximately 7–20 seconds after the shock. The landslide, the largest in recorded history, travelled at and moved across Spirit Lake's west arm. Part of it hit a ridge about north. Some of the slide spilled over the ridge, but most of it moved down the North Fork <a href="Toutle%20River">Toutle River</a>, filling its valley up to deep with avalanche debris. An area of about was covered, and the total volume of the deposit was about .

Scientists were able to reconstruct the motion of the landslide from a series of rapid photographs by Gary Rosenquist, who was camping away from the blast. Rosenquist, his party and his photographs survived because the blast was deflected by local topography short of his location.

Most of St. Helens' former north side became a rubble deposit long, averaging thick; the slide was thickest at below Spirit Lake and thinnest at its western margin. The landslide temporarily displaced the waters of Spirit lake to the ridge north of the lake, in a giant wave approximately high. This in turn created a avalanche of debris consisting of the returning waters and thousands of uprooted trees and stumps. Some of these remained intact with roots, but most had been sheared off at the stump seconds earlier by the blast of super-heated volcanic gas and ash that had immediately followed and overtook the initial landslide. The debris was transported along with the water as it returned to its <a href="drainage%20basin">basin</a>, raising the surface level of Spirit Lake by about . 

More than three decades after the eruption, floating log mats persist on Spirit Lake and nearby St. Helens Lake, changing position with the wind. The rest of the trees, especially those that were not completely detached from their roots, were turned upright by their own weight and became waterlogged, sinking into the muddy sediments at the bottom where they have become <a href="petrification">petrified</a> in the anaerobic and mineral-rich waters. This provides insight into other sites with a similar fossil record.

The landslide exposed the <a href="dacite">dacite</a> magma in St. Helens' neck to much lower pressure, causing the gas-charged, partially molten rock and high-pressure steam above it to explode a few seconds after the landslide started. <a href="Explosion">Explosion</a>s burst through the trailing part of the landslide, blasting rock debris northward. The resulting blast laterally directed the <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a> of very hot volcanic gases, ash and <a href="pumice">pumice</a> formed from new lava, while the pulverized old rock hugged the ground, initially moving at but quickly accelerating to , and it might have briefly passed the <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speed of sound</a>.

Pyroclastic flow material passed over the moving avalanche and spread outward, devastating a fan-shaped area 23 miles across by 19 miles long (37 km × 31 km). In total about of forest was knocked down, and extreme heat killed trees miles beyond the blow-down zone. At its vent the <a href="lateral%20eruption">lateral blast</a> probably did not last longer than about 30 seconds, but the northward-radiating and expanding blast cloud continued for about another minute.

Superheated flow material flashed water in Spirit Lake and North Fork Toutle River to steam, creating a larger, secondary explosion that was heard as far away as <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, and <a href="Northern%20California">Northern California</a>. Yet many areas closer to the eruption (<a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, for example) did not hear the blast. This so-called "quiet zone" extended radially a few tens of miles from the volcano and was created by the complex response of the eruption's sound waves to differences in temperature and air motion of the atmospheric layers and, to a lesser extent, local <a href="topography">topography</a>.

Later studies indicated that one-third of the of material in the flow was new lava, and the rest was fragmented, older rock.

The huge ensuing ash cloud sent skyward from St. Helens' northern foot was visible throughout the quiet zone. The near-supersonic lateral blast, loaded with volcanic debris, caused devastation as far as from the volcano. The area affected by the blast can be subdivided into three roughly concentric zones:
By the time this pyroclastic flow hit its first human victims, it was still as hot as and filled with suffocating gas and flying debris. Most of the 57 people known to have died in that day's eruption succumbed to <a href="asphyxiation">asphyxiation</a> while several died from burns. Lodge owner <a href="Harry%20Randall%20Truman">Harry R. Truman</a> was buried under hundreds of feet of avalanche material. Volcanologist <a href="David%20A.%20Johnston">David A. Johnston</a> was one of those killed, as was <a href="Reid%20Blackburn">Reid Blackburn</a>, a "<a href="National%20Geographic%20Magazine">National Geographic</a>" photographer. <a href="Robert%20Landsburg">Robert Landsburg</a>, another photographer, was killed by the ash cloud. He was able to protect his film with his body, and the surviving photos provided geologists with valuable documentation of the historic eruption.

Subsequent outpourings of pyroclastic material from the breach left by the <a href="landslide">landslide</a> consisted mainly of new magmatic debris rather than fragments of preexisting volcanic rocks. The resulting deposits formed a fan-like pattern of overlapping sheets, tongues and lobes. At least 17 separate pyroclastic flows occurred during the May 18 eruption, and their aggregate volume was about .

The flow deposits were still at about two weeks after they erupted. Secondary steam-blast eruptions fed by this heat created pits on the northern margin of the pyroclastic-flow deposits, at the south shore of Spirit Lake, and along the upper part of the North Fork Toutle River. These steam-blast explosions continued sporadically for weeks or months after the emplacement of pyroclastic flows, and at least one occurred a year later, on May 16, 1981.

As the avalanche and initial pyroclastic flow were still advancing, a huge ash column grew to a height of above the expanding crater in less than 10 minutes and spread <a href="tephra">tephra</a> into the <a href="stratosphere">stratosphere</a> for 10 straight hours. Near the volcano, the swirling ash particles in the atmosphere generated <a href="lightning">lightning</a>, which in turn started many <a href="forest%20fires">forest fires</a>. During this time, parts of the <a href="Mushroom%20cloud">mushroom</a>-shaped ash-cloud column collapsed, and fell back upon the earth. This fallout, mixed with magma, mud, and steam, sent additional pyroclastic flows speeding down St. Helens' flanks. Later, slower flows came directly from the new north-facing crater and consisted of glowing pumice bombs and very hot pumiceous ash. Some of these hot flows covered ice or water which flashed to steam, creating craters up to in diameter and sending ash as much as into 

Strong high-altitude wind carried much of this material east-northeasterly from the volcano at an average speed of about . By 9:45 a.m. it had reached <a href="Yakima%2C%20Washington">Yakima, Washington</a>, away, and by 11:45 a.m. it was over <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane, Washington</a>. A total of of ash fell on Yakima, and areas as far east as Spokane were plunged into darkness by noon where visibility was reduced to and of ash fell. Continuing St. Helens' ash fell in the western part of <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> by 10:15 p.m. and was seen on the ground in <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, Colorado, the next day. In time, ash fall from this eruption was reported as far away as <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> and <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, and some of the ash drifted around the globe within about 

During the nine hours of vigorous eruptive activity, about 540,000,000 tons () of ash fell over an area of more than . The total volume of the ash before its compaction by rainfall was about . The volume of the uncompacted ash is equivalent to about of solid rock, or about 7% of the amount of material that slid off in the debris avalanche. By around 5:30 p.m. on May 18, the vertical ash column declined in stature, but less severe outbursts continued through the next 

Generally, given that the way airborne ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will occur, as a function of distance to the volcano or time elapsed from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence the ash properties have large variations.

The bulk chemical composition of the ash has been found to be approximately 65% <a href="silicon%20dioxide">silicon dioxide</a>, 18% <a href="aluminium%20oxide">aluminium oxide</a>, 5% <a href="Iron%28III%29%20oxide">ferric oxide</a>, 4% each <a href="calcium%20oxide">calcium oxide</a> and <a href="sodium%20oxide">sodium oxide</a> and 2% <a href="magnesium%20oxide">magnesium oxide</a>. Trace chemicals were also detected, their concentrations varying as shown: 0.05–0.09% <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, 0.02–0.03% <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a>, and 0.09–0.3% <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>.

The <a href="index%20of%20refraction">index of refraction</a>, a number used in <a href="physics">physics</a> to describe how light propagates through a particular substance, is an important property of volcanic ash. This number is "<a href="complex%20number">complex</a>" having both "<a href="real%20number">real</a>" and "<a href="imaginary%20number">imaginary</a>" parts, the real part indicating how light disperses and the imaginary part indicating how light is absorbed by the substance.

It is known that the silicate particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for visible light. However, there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash, from very light to dark gray. This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under visible light.

In the case of Mount St. Helens, the ash settled in three main layers on the ground: 

For example, when comparing the imaginary part of the refractive index "k" of stratospheric ash from from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700 nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300 nm. Here, the sample ("k" was found to be around 0.009) was much more absorbent than the sample ("k" was found to be around 0.002).

The hot, exploding material also broke apart and melted nearly all of the mountain's <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s along with most of the overlying snow. As in many previous St. Helens' eruptions, this created huge <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s (volcanic <a href="mudflow">mudflow</a>s) and muddy floods that affected three of the four stream drainage systems on the mountain, and which started to move as early as 8:50 a.m. Lahars travelled as fast as while still high on the volcano but progressively slowed to about on the flatter and wider parts of rivers. Mudflows from the southern and eastern flanks had the consistency of wet concrete as they raced down Muddy River, Pine Creek and Smith Creek to their confluence at the <a href="Lewis%20River%20%28Washington%29">Lewis River</a>. Bridges were taken out at the mouth of Pine Creek and the head of Swift Reservoir, which rose by noon to accommodate the nearly of additional water, mud and debris.

Glacier and snow melt mixed with <a href="tephra">tephra</a> on the volcano's northeast slope to create much larger lahars. These mudflows traveled down the north and south forks of the Toutle River and joined at the confluence of the Toutle forks and the <a href="Cowlitz%20River">Cowlitz River</a> near <a href="Castle%20Rock%2C%20Washington">Castle Rock, Washington</a>, at 1:00 p.m. Ninety minutes after the eruption, the first mudflow had moved upstream where observers at <a href="Weyerhaeuser">Weyerhaeuser</a>'s Camp Baker saw a wall of muddy water and debris pass. Near the confluence of the Toutle's north and south forks at Silver Lake, a record <a href="flood%20stage">flood stage</a> of was recorded.

A large but slower-moving mudflow with a mortar-like consistency was mobilized in early afternoon at the head of the Toutle River north fork. By 2:30 p.m. the massive mudflow had destroyed Camp Baker, and in the following hours seven bridges were carried away. Part of the flow backed up for soon after entering the Cowlitz River, but most continued downstream. After traveling further, an estimated of material were injected into the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, reducing the river's depth by for a stretch. The resulting river depth temporarily closed the busy channel to ocean-going <a href="Cargo%20ship">freighters</a>, costing <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, an estimated five million US dollars (equivalent to $ million today). Ultimately, more than of sediment were dumped along the lower Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers.

The May 18, 1980, event was the most deadly and economically destructive volcanic eruption in the <a href="history%20of%20the%20United%20States">history of the contiguous United States</a>. Approximately fifty-seven people were killed directly from the blast and 200 houses, 47 bridges, of railways and of highway were destroyed; two people were killed indirectly in accidents that resulted from poor visibility, and two more suffered fatal heart attacks from shoveling ash. U.S. President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> surveyed the damage and said it looked more desolate than a <a href="moon">moon</a>scape. 

A film crew was dropped by helicopter on Mount St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. However, their <a href="compass">compass</a>es spun in circles and they quickly became lost. A second eruption occurred the next day (see below), but the crew survived and were rescued two days after that. The eruption ejected more than of material. A quarter of that volume was fresh lava in the form of ash, pumice and <a href="volcanic%20bomb">volcanic bomb</a>s while the rest was fragmented, older <a href="rock%20%28geology%29">rock</a>. The removal of the north side of the mountain (13% of the cone's volume) reduced Mount St. Helens' height by about and left a crater wide and deep with its north end open in a huge breach.

More than of timber was damaged or destroyed, mainly by the lateral blast. At least 25% of the destroyed timber was salvaged after September 1980. Downwind of the volcano, in areas of thick ash accumulation, many agricultural crops, such as wheat, apples, potatoes and <a href="alfalfa">alfalfa</a>, were destroyed. As many as 1,500 <a href="elk">elk</a> and 5,000 <a href="deer">deer</a> were killed, and an estimated 12 million <a href="Chinook%20salmon">Chinook</a> and <a href="Coho%20salmon">Coho</a> <a href="salmon">salmon</a> fingerlings died when their hatcheries were destroyed. Another estimated 40,000 young salmon were lost when they swam through <a href="turbine">turbine</a> blades of <a href="hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> generators after <a href="lake">reservoir</a> levels were lowered along the Lewis River to accommodate possible mudflows and flood waters.

In total, Mount St. Helens released 24 megatons of thermal energy, seven of which were a direct result of the blast. This is equivalent to 1,600 times the size of the <a href="Little%20Boy">atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima</a>.

There is a minor controversy in regard to the exact death toll. The figure most commonly cited is fifty-seven. However, there are two points of dispute.

The first point regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were reported missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators were able to locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, they were unable to determine who reported Hiatt missing, and the person who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the "same" Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.

The second point regards three missing people who are not officially listed as victims: Robert Ruffle, Steven Whitsett and Mark Melanson. <a href="Cowlitz%20County%2C%20Washington">Cowlitz County</a> Emergency Services Management lists them as "Possibly Missing — Not on [the official] List". According to Melanson's brother, in October 1983, Cowlitz County officials told his family that Melanson "is believed [...] a victim of the May 18, 1980, eruption" and that after years of searching, the family eventually decided "he's buried in the ash".

Taking these two points of dispute into consideration, the direct death toll could be as low as fifty-five or as high as sixty. When combined with the four indirect victims mentioned earlier, those numbers range from fifty-nine to sixty-four.

The ash fall created some temporary major problems with transportation, <a href="sewage">sewage</a> disposal, and <a href="water%20treatment">water treatment</a> systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. <a href="Interstate%2090">Interstate 90</a> from <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> to <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane</a> was closed for a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for <a href="internal-combustion%20engine">internal-combustion engine</a>s and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused <a href="short%20circuit">short circuit</a>s in electrical transformers, which in turn caused <a href="power%20blackout">power blackout</a>s.

Removing and disposing of the ash was a monumental task for some Eastern Washington communities. State and federal agencies estimated that over of ash, equivalent to about 900,000 tons in weight, were removed from highways and airports in Washington. The ash removal cost $2.2 million and took 10 weeks in Yakima. The need to remove ash quickly from transport routes and civil works dictated the selection of some disposal sites. Some cities used old quarries and existing sanitary <a href="landfill">landfill</a>s; others created dump sites wherever expedient. To minimize wind reworking of ash dumps, the surfaces of some disposal sites were covered with topsoil and seeded with grass. In Portland, Oregon, the mayor eventually threatened businesses with fines if they failed to remove the ash from their parking lots.

A refined estimate of $1.1 billion ($3.4 billion ) was determined in a study by the <a href="International%20Trade%20Commission">International Trade Commission</a> at the request of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>. A supplemental appropriation of $951 million for disaster relief was voted by Congress, of which the largest share went to the <a href="Small%20Business%20Administration">Small Business Administration</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> and the <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>.

There were also indirect and intangible costs of the eruption. Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, and then returned to near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption. Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering <a href="Stress%20%28medicine%29">stress</a> and <a href="emotion">emotion</a>al problems, even though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people.

Initial public reaction to the May 18 eruption dealt a nearly crippling blow to tourism, an important industry in Washington. Not only was tourism down in the Mount St. Helens–<a href="Gifford%20Pinchot%20National%20Forest">Gifford Pinchot National Forest</a> area, but conventions, meetings and social gatherings also were cancelled or postponed at cities and resorts elsewhere in Washington and neighboring <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> not affected by the eruption. The adverse effect on tourism and conventioneering, however, proved only temporary. Mount St. Helens, perhaps because of its reawakening, has regained its appeal for tourists. The <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a> and the State of Washington opened visitor centers and provided access for people to view the volcano's devastation.

St. Helens produced an additional five explosive eruptions between May and October 1980. Through early 1990, at least twenty-one periods of eruptive activity had occurred. The volcano remains active, with smaller, dome-building eruptions continuing into 2008.

An eruption occurred on May 25, 1980, at 2:30 a.m. that sent an ash column into the atmosphere. The eruption was preceded by a sudden increase in earthquake activity and occurred during a rainstorm. Erratic wind from the storm carried ash from the eruption to the south and west, lightly dusting large parts of western Washington and Oregon. Pyroclastic flows exited the northern breach and covered avalanche debris, lahars and other pyroclastic flows deposited by the May 18 eruption.

At 7:05 p.m. on June 12, a plume of ash billowed above the volcano. At 9:09 p.m. a much stronger explosion sent an ash column about skyward. This event caused the Portland area, previously spared by wind direction, to be thinly coated with ash in the middle of the annual Rose Festival.
A <a href="dacite">dacite</a> dome then oozed into existence on the crater floor, growing to a height of and a width of within a week.

A series of large explosions on July 22 broke more than a month of relative quiet. The July eruptive episode was preceded by several days of measurable expansion of the summit area, heightened earthquake activity, and changed emission rates of <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. The first hit at 5:14 p.m. as an ash column shot and was followed by a faster blast at 6:25 p.m. that pushed the ash column above its previous maximum height in just 7.5 minutes. The final explosion started at 7:01 p.m. and continued for over two hours. When the relatively small amount of ash settled over eastern Washington, the dome built in June was gone.
Seismic activity and gas emission steadily increased in early August, and on August 7 at 4:26 p.m., an ash cloud slowly expanded into the sky. Small pyroclastic flows came through the northern breach and a weaker outpouring of ash rose from the crater. This continued until 10:32 p.m. when a second large blast sent ash high into the air, proceeding due north. A second dacite dome filled this vent a few days later.

Two months of repose were ended by an eruption lasting from October 16 to 18. This event obliterated the second dome, sent ash in the air and created small, red-hot <a href="pyroclastic">pyroclastic</a> flows. A third dome began to form within 30 minutes after the final explosion on October 18, and within a few days, it was about wide and high. In spite of the dome growth next to it, <a href="Crater%20Glacier">a new glacier</a> formed rapidly inside the crater.

All of the post-1980 eruptions were quiet dome-building events, beginning with the December 27, 1980, to January 3, 1981, episode. By 1987 the third dome had grown to be more than wide and high.

Further eruptions occurred over a few months between 1989 and 1991.

The <a href="2004%E2%80%9308%20volcanic%20activity%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens">2004–08 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens</a> has been documented as a continuous eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano. Starting in October 2004, there was a gradual building of a new lava dome. The new dome did not rise above the caldera created by the 1980 eruption. This activity lasted until January 2008.

Hugh Walpole

Sir Hugh Seymour Walpole, <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> (13 March 18841 June 1941) was an English novelist. He was the son of an <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> clergyman, intended for a career in the church but drawn instead to writing. Among those who encouraged him were the authors <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a> and <a href="Arnold%20Bennett">Arnold Bennett</a>. His skill at scene-setting and vivid plots, as well as his high profile as a lecturer, brought him a large readership in the United Kingdom and North America. He was a best-selling author in the 1920s and 1930s but has been largely neglected since his death.

After his <a href="debut%20novel">first novel</a>, "The Wooden Horse", in 1909, Walpole wrote prolifically, producing at least one book every year. He was a spontaneous story-teller, writing quickly to get all his ideas on paper, seldom revising. His first novel to achieve major success was his third, "Mr Perrin and Mr Traill", a tragicomic story of a fatal clash between two schoolmasters. During the First World War he served in the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Russian-Austrian front</a>, and worked in British propaganda in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Petrograd</a> and London. In the 1920s and 1930s Walpole was much in demand not only as a novelist but also as a lecturer on literature, making four exceptionally well-paid tours of North America.

As a gay man at a time when homosexual practices were illegal for men in Britain, Walpole conducted a succession of intense but discreet relationships with other men, and was for much of his life in search of what he saw as "the perfect friend". He eventually found one, a married policeman, with whom he settled in the English <a href="Lake%20District">Lake District</a>. Having as a young man eagerly sought the support of established authors, he was in his later years a generous sponsor of many younger writers. He was a patron of the visual arts and bequeathed a substantial legacy of paintings to the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a> and other British institutions.

Walpole's output was large and varied. Between 1909 and 1941 he wrote thirty-six novels, five volumes of short stories, two original plays and three volumes of memoirs. His range included disturbing studies of the macabre, children's stories and historical fiction, most notably his "Herries Chronicle" series, set in the Lake District. He worked in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> writing scenarios for two <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> films in the 1930s, and played a <a href="cameo%20role">cameo</a> in the 1935 version of "<a href="David%20Copperfield%20%281935%20film%29">David Copperfield</a>".

Walpole was born in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, New Zealand, the eldest of three children of the Rev <a href="Somerset%20Walpole">Somerset Walpole</a> and his wife, Mildred Helen, "née" Barham (1854–1925). Somerset Walpole had been an assistant to the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Truro">Bishop of Truro</a>, <a href="Edward%20White%20Benson">Edward White Benson</a>, from 1877 until 1882, when he was offered the <a href="Incumbent%20%28ecclesiastical%29">incumbency</a> of <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Cathedral%20Church">St Mary's Cathedral Church</a>, Auckland; on Benson's advice he accepted.

Mildred Walpole found it hard to settle in New Zealand, and something of her restlessness and insecurity affected the character of her eldest child. In 1889, two years after the birth of the couple's daughter, Dorothea ("Dorothy"), Somerset Walpole accepted a prominent and well-paid academic post at the <a href="General%20Theological%20Seminary">General Theological Seminary</a>, New York. Robert ("Robin"), the third of the couple's children, was born in New York in 1892. Hugh and Dorothy were taught by a <a href="governess">governess</a> until the middle of 1893, when the parents decided that he needed an English education.

Walpole was sent to England, where according to his biographer <a href="Rupert%20Hart-Davis">Rupert Hart-Davis</a> the next ten years were the unhappiest time of Walpole's life. He first attended a preparatory school in <a href="Truro">Truro</a>. Though he missed his family and felt lonely he was reasonably happy, but he moved to <a href="Sir%20William%20Borlase%27s%20Grammar%20School">Sir William Borlase's Grammar School</a> in <a href="Marlow%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Marlow</a> in 1895, where he was bullied, frightened and miserable. He later said, "The food was inadequate, the morality was 'twisted', and Terror – sheer, stark unblinking Terror – stared down every one of its passages ... The excessive desire to be loved that has always played so enormous a part in my life was bred largely, I think, from the neglect I suffered there".

In 1896 Somerset Walpole discovered his son's horror of the Marlow school and he moved him to the <a href="the%20King%27s%20School%2C%20Canterbury">King's School, Canterbury</a>. For two years he was a fairly content, though undistinguished, pupil there. In 1897 Walpole senior was appointed principal of <a href="College%20of%20St%20Hild%20and%20St%20Bede">Bede College, Durham</a>, and Hugh was moved again, to be a <a href="day%20pupil">day boy</a> for four years at <a href="Durham%20School">Durham School</a>. He found that day boys were looked down on by <a href="boarding%20school">boarders</a>, and that Bede College was the subject of snobbery within the university. His sense of isolation increased. He continually took refuge in the local library, where he read all the novels of <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>, <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a>, <a href="Walter%20Scott">Scott</a> and <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Dickens</a> and many of the works of <a href="Anthony%20Trollope">Trollope</a>, <a href="Wilkie%20Collins">Wilkie Collins</a> and <a href="Henry%20Kingsley">Henry Kingsley</a>. Walpole wrote in 1924:

Though Walpole was no admirer of the schools he had attended there, the cathedral cities of Truro, Canterbury and Durham made a strong impression on him. He drew on aspects of them for his fictional cathedral city of Polchester in Glebeshire, the setting of many of his later books. Walpole's memories of his time at Canterbury grew mellower over the years; it was the only school he mentioned in his "<a href="Who%27s%20Who%20%28UK%29">Who's Who</a>" entry.

From 1903 to 1906 Walpole studied history at <a href="Emmanuel%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Emmanuel College, Cambridge</a>. While there he had his first work published, the critical essay "Two Meredithian Heroes", which was printed in the college magazine in autumn 1905. As an undergraduate he met and fell under the spell of <a href="A.%20C.%20Benson">A.C.Benson</a>, formerly a greatly loved master at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a>, and by this time a don at <a href="Magdalene%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Magdalene College</a>. Walpole's religious beliefs, hitherto an unquestioned part of his life, were fading, and Benson helped him through that personal crisis. Walpole was also attempting to cope with his homosexual feelings, which for a while focused on Benson, who recorded in his diary in 1906 an unexpected outburst by his young admirer: "[H]e broke out rather eagerly into protestations – He cared for me more than anyone in the world. I could not believe it... It is extraordinarily touching... It is quite right that he should believe all this passionately; it is quite right that I should know that it will not last ... I tried to say this as tenderly as I could..."

Benson gently declined Walpole's advances. They remained friends, but Walpole, rebuffed in his "excessive desire to be loved", turned the full force of his enthusiasms elsewhere, and the relationship with Benson became less important to him. Less than two years later Benson's diary entry on Walpole's subsequent social career reveals his thoughts on his protégé's progress:

With Benson's help, Walpole had come to terms with the loss of his faith. Somerset Walpole, himself the son of an Anglican priest, hoped that his eldest son would follow him into the ministry. Walpole was too concerned for his father's feelings to tell him he was no longer a believer, and on graduation from Cambridge in 1906 he took a post as a lay missioner at the <a href="The%20Mission%20to%20Seafarers">Mersey Mission to Seamen</a> in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. He described that as one of the "greatest failures of my life... The Mission to Seamen was, and is, a splendid institution... but it needs men of a certain type to carry it through and I was not of that type." The head of the mission reprimanded him for lack of commitment to his work, and Walpole resigned after six months.

From April to July 1907 Walpole was in Germany, tutoring the children of the popular author <a href="Elizabeth%20von%20Arnim">Elizabeth von Arnim</a>. In 1908 he taught French at <a href="Epsom%20College">Epsom College</a>. His brief experience of teaching is reflected in his third novel, "Mr Perrin and Mr Traill". As well as the clerical forebears, Walpole had notable authors in his family tree: on his father's side, the novelist and letter writer <a href="Horace%20Walpole">Horace Walpole</a>, and on his mother's <a href="Richard%20Harris%20Barham">Richard Harris Barham</a>, author of "<a href="The%20Ingoldsby%20Legends">The Ingoldsby Legends</a>". It was as an author that Walpole felt impelled to make his career. He moved to London and found work as a book reviewer for <a href="London%20Evening%20Standard">"The Standard"</a>, writing fiction in his spare time. He had by this time recognised unreservedly that he was homosexual. His encounters were necessarily discreet, as such activities were illegal in Britain, and remained so throughout his lifetime. He was constantly searching for "the perfect friend"; an early candidate was the stage designer <a href="Percy%20Anderson">Percy Anderson</a>, to whom he was intimately attached for some time from 1910 onwards.

A. C. Benson was a friend of <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>, to whom Walpole wrote a fan letter late in 1908, with Benson's encouragement. A correspondence ensued and in February 1909 James invited Walpole to lunch at the <a href="Reform%20Club">Reform Club</a> in London. They developed a close friendship, described by James's biographer <a href="Leon%20Edel">Leon Edel</a> as resembling a father and son relationship in some, but not all, respects. James was greatly taken with the young Walpole, though clear-eyed about the deficiencies in the artistry and craftsmanship of his protégé's early efforts. According to <a href="Somerset%20Maugham">Somerset Maugham</a>, Walpole made a sexual proposition to James, who was too inhibited to respond. Nevertheless, in their correspondence the older man's devotion was couched in extravagant terms.

Walpole published his first novel, "The Wooden Horse", in 1909. It told of a staid and snobbish English family shaken up by the return of one of its members from a less hidebound life in New Zealand. The book received good reviews but barely repaid the cost of having it typed. His first commercial success was "Mr Perrin and Mr Traill", published in 1911. The novelist and biographer <a href="Michael%20Sadleir">Michael Sadleir</a> writes that though some of the six novels Walpole wrote between 1909 and 1914 are of interest as examples of the author's developing style, it is "Mr Perrin and Mr Traill" that deserves to be remembered for its own sake. The book, subtitled "a tragi-comedy", is a psychological study of a deadly clash between two schoolmasters, one an ageing failure and the other a young, attractive idealist. In the view of Hart-Davis, Walpole only once recaptured "the fresh, clear cut realism" of this book, and Walpole himself, looking back on his work in the 1930s, felt that of all his books to date, it was the truest. "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" gave the book a favourable review: "The slow growth of the poison within [Perrin] is traced with wonderful skill and sympathy ... one feels throughout these pages a sense of intolerable tension, of impending disaster"; "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" was less enthusiastic, praising the scene-setting but calling the story "an unconscientious melodrama". "<a href="The%20San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">The San Francisco Chronicle</a>" praised its "technical excellence, imagination and beauty – Walpole at his best." <a href="Arnold%20Bennett">Arnold Bennett</a>, a well-established novelist seventeen years Walpole's senior, admired the book, and befriended the young author, regularly chiding, encouraging, sometimes mocking him into improving his prose, characters and narratives.

The "Guardian" reviewer observed that the setting of "Mr Perrin and Mr Traill" – a second-rate <a href="public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">public school</a> – was clearly drawn from life, as indeed it was. The boys of Epsom College were delighted with the thinly disguised version of their school, but the college authorities were not, and Walpole was "<a href="Persona%20non%20grata%23Non-diplomatic%20usage">persona non grata</a>" at Epsom for many years. This was of no practical consequence, as he had no intention of returning to the teaching profession, but it was an early illustration of his capacity, noted by Benson, for unthinkingly giving offence, though being hypersensitive to criticism himself.

In early 1914 James wrote an article for "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>" surveying the younger generation of British novelists and comparing them with their eminent elder contemporaries. In the latter category James put Bennett, <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>, <a href="John%20Galsworthy">John Galsworthy</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Hewlett">Maurice Hewlett</a> and HGWells. The four new authors on whom he focused were Walpole, <a href="Gilbert%20Cannan">Gilbert Cannan</a>, <a href="Compton%20Mackenzie">Compton Mackenzie</a> and <a href="D.H.%20Lawrence">D H Lawrence</a>. It was a very lengthy article, to the extent that it had to be spread across two issues of the Supplement in March and April 1914. James said that agreeing to write it had been "an insensate step", but from Walpole's point of view it was highly satisfactory: one of the greatest living authors had publicly ranked him among the finest young British novelists.

As war approached, Walpole realised that his poor eyesight would disqualify him from serving in the armed forces. He volunteered to join the police, but was turned down; he then accepted a journalistic appointment based in Moscow, reporting for "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28London%29">The Saturday Review</a>" and "<a href="The%20Daily%20Mail">The Daily Mail</a>". He was allowed to visit the front in Poland, but his dispatches from Moscow (and later from <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Petrograd</a>, which he preferred) were not enough to stop hostile comments at home that he was not doing his bit for the war effort. Henry James was so incensed at one such remark by a prominent London hostess that he stormed out of her house and wrote to Walpole suggesting that he should return to England. Walpole replied in great excitement that he had just been appointed as a Russian officer, in the Sanitar:

While in training for the Sanitar, Walpole devoted his leisure hours to gaining a reasonable fluency in the Russian language, and to his first full-length work of non-fiction, a literary biography of Joseph Conrad. In the summer of 1915 he worked on the Austrian-Russian front, assisting at operations in field hospitals and retrieving the dead and wounded from the battlefield. Occasionally he found time to write brief letters home; he told Bennett, "A battle is an amazing mixture of hell and a family picnic – not as frightening as the dentist, but absorbing, sometimes thrilling like football, sometimes dull like church, and sometimes simply physically sickening like bad fish. Burying dead afterwards is worst of all." When disheartened he comforted himself with the thought, "This is not so bad as it was at Marlow".

During an engagement early in June 1915 Walpole single-handedly rescued a wounded soldier; his Russian comrades refused to help and Walpole carried one end of a stretcher and dragged the man to safety. For this he was awarded the <a href="Cross%20of%20Saint%20George">Cross of Saint George</a>; General Lechitsky presented him with the medal in August. After his tour of duty Walpole returned to Petrograd. Among the city's attractions for him was the presence of <a href="Konstantin%20Somov">Konstantin Somov</a>, a painter with whom he had formed an intimate relationship. He remained there until October 1915, when he returned to England. He visited his family, stayed with Percy Anderson in London, telephoned Henry James in <a href="Rye%2C%20East%20Sussex">Rye</a>, and retreated to a cottage he had bought in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. In January 1916 he was asked by the <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign Office</a> to return to Petrograd. Russians were being subjected to highly effective German propaganda. The writer <a href="Arthur%20Ransome">Arthur Ransome</a>, Petrograd correspondent of "<a href="The%20Daily%20News%20%28UK%29">The Daily News</a>", had successfully lobbied for the establishment of a bureau to counter the German efforts, and the British ambassador, <a href="George%20Buchanan%20%28diplomat%29">Sir George Buchanan</a>, wanted Walpole to take charge.

Before he left for Petrograd, Walpole's novel "The Dark Forest" was published. It drew on his experiences in Russia, and was more sombre than much of his earlier fiction. Reviews were highly favourable; "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" commented on "a high level of imaginative vision... reveals capacity and powers in the author which we had hardly suspected before."

Walpole returned to Petrograd in February 1916. He moved into Somov's flat, and his Anglo-Russian Propaganda Bureau began work. The following month he suffered a personal blow: he recorded in his diary for 13 March 1916, "Thirty two to-day! Should have been a happy day but was completely clouded for me by reading in the papers of Henry James' death. This was a terrible shock to me." Walpole remained at the bureau for the rest of 1916 and most of 1917, witnessing the <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a>. He wrote an official report on events for the Foreign Office, and also absorbed ideas for his fiction. In addition to the first of his popular "Jeremy" novels, written in his spare time from the bureau, he began work on the second of his Russian-themed books, "The Secret City". Sadleir writes that this novel and "The Dark Forest" "take a high place among his works, on account of their intuitive understanding of an alien mentality and the vigour of their narrative power." The book won the inaugural <a href="James%20Tait%20Black%20Memorial%20Prize">James Tait Black Memorial Prize</a> for fiction.

By late 1917 it was clear to Walpole and to the British authorities that there was little advantage in keeping him in Russia. On 7 November he left, missing the <a href="October%20Revolution">Bolshevik Revolution</a>, which began on that day. He was appointed to a post at the Foreign Office in its Department of Information, headed by <a href="John%20Buchan">John Buchan</a>. Soon after returning he volunteered for the British army, but, as expected, failed the necessary medical examination because of his poor sight. He continued to work in British propaganda when the department was reconstituted under <a href="Max%20Aitken%2C%20Lord%20Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbrook</a> in April 1918, and remained there for the rest of the war and beyond, resigning in February 1919. Little is known about what he wrote for the department, as most of its records were destroyed after the war, but he noted in his diary that he had written the department's official report to the War Cabinet: "a beastly job – the worst I've ever attempted". For his wartime work he was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> in 1918.

Walpole remained prolific in the post-war years, and began a parallel and highly remunerative career as a lecturer in literature. At the instigation of his American publisher, George Doran, he made his first lecture tour of the US in 1919, receiving an enthusiastic welcome wherever he went. What Sadleir describes as Walpole's "genial and attractive appearance, his complete lack of aloofness, his exciting fluency as a speaker [and] his obvious and genuine liking for his hosts" combined to win him a large American following. The success of his talks led to increases in his lecturing fees, greatly enhanced sales of his books, and large sums from American publishers anxious to print his latest fiction. He was a prodigiously quick writer who seldom revised, but pressed on, keen to get his ideas down on paper. His main British publishers, Macmillan, found it expedient to appoint a senior member of staff to edit his manuscripts, correcting spelling, punctuation, inconsistencies and errors of historical fact. His fluency enabled him to fulfil between tours a contract from "<a href="Pictorial%20Review">The Pictorial Review</a>" for ten short stories at the remarkable sum of $1,350 apiece.

One of Walpole's major novels of the early post-war period was "The Cathedral", which unlike much of his fiction was not dashed off but worked on across four years, beginning in 1918. The story of an arrogant 19th-century <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a> in conflict with other clergy and laity was certain to bring comparisons with Trollope's "<a href="Barchester%20Towers">Barchester Towers</a>" ("The Manchester Guardian"s review was headed "Polchester Towers"), but unlike the earlier work, "The Cathedral" is wholly uncomic. The <a href="hubris">hubris</a>tic Archdeacon Brandon is driven to domestic despair, professional defeat and sudden death. The reviewer <a href="Ivor%20Brown">Ivor Brown</a> commented that Walpole had earlier charmed many with his cheerful tales of Mayfair, but that in this novel he showed a greater side to his art: "This is a book with little happiness about it, but its stark strength is undeniable. "The Cathedral" is realism, profound in its philosophy and delicate in its thread." "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" said, "No former novelist has seized quite so powerfully upon the cathedral fabric and made it a living character in the drama, an obsessing individuality at once benign and forbidding..."The Cathedral" is a great book."

Walpole was a keen music lover and when in 1920 he heard a new <a href="tenor">tenor</a> at the <a href="the%20Proms">Proms</a> he was much impressed and sought him out. <a href="Lauritz%20Melchior">Lauritz Melchior</a> became one of the most important friendships of his life, and Walpole did much to foster the singer's budding career. <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>'s son <a href="Siegfried%20Wagner">Siegfried</a> engaged Melchior for the <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth Festival</a> in 1924 and succeeding years. Walpole attended, and met <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, then recently released from prison after an <a href="Beer%20Hall%20Putsch">attempted putsch</a>. Hitler was a protégé of Siegfried's wife <a href="Winifred%20Wagner">Winifred</a>, and was known in Bayreuth as "one of Winnie's lame ducks." Walpole later admitted that he had both despised and liked him – "both emotions that time has proved I was wrong to indulge". This and future visits to Bayreuth were complicated by the fact that Winifred Wagner fell in love with Walpole, and attached herself so firmly to him that rumours began to spread.

In 1924 Walpole moved into a house near <a href="Keswick%2C%20Cumbria">Keswick</a> in the <a href="Lake%20District">Lake District</a>. His large income enabled him to maintain his London flat in <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a>, but Brackenburn, on the slopes of <a href="Catbells">Catbells</a> overlooking <a href="Derwentwater">Derwentwater</a>, was his main home for the rest of his life. He was quickly made welcome by local residents, and the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake District often found their way into his fiction. The critic <a href="James%20Agate">James Agate</a> commented that one might think from some of Walpole's stories that their author had created the English Lakes, but that he was probably only consulted about them. At the end of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of Walpole's life. In Hart-Davis's words, he came nearer than any other human being to Walpole's long-sought conception of a perfect friend. Cheevers, a policeman, with a wife and two children, left the police force and entered Walpole's service as his chauffeur. Walpole trusted him completely, and gave him extensive control over his affairs. Whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was almost always with him, and often accompanied him on overseas trips. Walpole provided a house in <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a> for Cheevers and his family.
During the mid-twenties Walpole produced two of his best-known novels in the macabre vein that he drew on from time to time, exploring the fascination of fear and cruelty. "The Old Ladies" (1924) is a study of a timid elderly spinster exploited and eventually frightened to death by a predatory widow. "Portrait of a Man with Red Hair" (1925) depicts the malign influence of a manipulative, insane father on his family and others. Walpole described it to his fellow author <a href="Frank%20Swinnerton">Frank Swinnerton</a> as "a simple shocker which it has amused me like anything to write, and won't bore you to read." In contrast he continued a series of stories for children, begun in 1919 with "Jeremy", taking the young hero's story forward with "Jeremy and Hamlet" (the latter being the boy's dog) in 1923, and "Jeremy at Crale" in 1927. Sadleir, writing in the 1950s, suggests that "the most real Walpole of all – because the most unselfconscious, kindly, and understanding friend – is the Walpole of the Jeremy trilogy." Of his other novels of the 1920s "Wintersmoon" (1928), his first attempt at a full-length love story, portrays a clash between traditionalism and modernism: his own sympathies, though not spelled out, were clearly with the traditionalists.

By the 1930s, though his public success remained considerable, many literary critics saw Walpole as outdated. His reputation in literary circles took a blow from a malicious caricature in Somerset Maugham's 1930 novel "<a href="Cakes%20and%20Ale">Cakes and Ale</a>": the character Alroy Kear, a superficial novelist of more pushy ambition than literary talent, was widely taken to be based on Walpole. In the same year Walpole wrote possibly his best-known work, "Rogue Herries", a historical novel set in the Lake District. It was well-received: "The Daily Mail" considered it "not only a profound study of human character, but a subtle and intimate biography of a place." He followed it with three sequels; all four novels were published in a single volume as "The Herries Chronicle".

In 1934 Walpole accepted an invitation from <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> studios to go to <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> to write the scenario for a <a href="David%20Copperfield%20%281935%20film%29">film adaptation</a> of "<a href="David%20Copperfield">David Copperfield</a>". He enjoyed many aspects of life in Hollywood, but as one who rarely revised any of his own work he found it tedious to produce sixth and seventh drafts at the behest of the studio. He enjoyed his brief change of role from writer to bit-part player: in the film he played the Vicar of Blunderstone delivering a boring sermon that sends David to sleep. Agate was doubtful of the wisdom of this: "Does not Hugh see that to bring a well-known character from real life into an imaginary sequence of events is to destroy the reality of that imaginary sequence?" Nevertheless, Walpole's performance was a success. He improvised the sermon; the producer, <a href="David%20O.%20Selznick">David O Selznick</a>, mischievously called for retake after retake to try to make him dry up, but Walpole fluently delivered a different extempore address each time.

The critical and commercial success of the film of "David Copperfield" led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there he found that the studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for "<a href="Little%20Lord%20Fauntleroy%20%281936%20film%29">Little Lord Fauntleroy</a>", which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.

In 1937 Walpole was offered a <a href="knight%20bachelor">knighthood</a>. He accepted, though confiding to his diary that he could not think of a good novelist since Walter Scott who had done so. "Kipling, Hardy, Galsworthy all refused. But I'm not of their class, and range with <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Doyle</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Hope">Anthony Hope</a> and such... Besides I shall like being a knight."

Walpole's taste for adventure did not diminish in his last years. In 1939 he was commissioned to report for <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>'s newspapers on the funeral in Rome of <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XI">Pope Pius XI</a>, the <a href="Papal%20conclave%2C%201939">conclave</a> to elect his successor, and the subsequent coronation. A fellow correspondent was <a href="Tom%20Driberg">Tom Driberg</a>, whose memoirs tell of a lunch "à deux" at which Walpole arrived flushed with excitement from a sexual encounter that morning with an attendant in the <a href="Borghese%20Palace">Borghese Palace</a>. In the weeks between the funeral and <a href="Pius%20XII">Pius XII</a>'s election Walpole, with his customary fluency, wrote much of his book "Roman Fountain", a mixture of fact and fiction about the city. This was his last overseas visit.

After the outbreak of the Second World War Walpole remained in England, dividing his time between London and Keswick, and continuing to write with his usual rapidity. He completed a fifth novel in the Herries series and began work on a sixth. His health was undermined by <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>. He overexerted himself at the opening of Keswick's fund-raising "War Weapons Week" in May 1941, making a speech after taking part in a lengthy march, and died of a heart attack at Brackenburn, aged 57. He is buried in St John's churchyard in Keswick.

Walpole was a keen and discerning collector of art. <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Sir Kenneth Clark</a> called him "one of the three or four real patrons of art in this country, and of that small body he was perhaps the most generous and the most discriminating." He left fourteen works to the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a> and <a href="Fitzwilliam%20Museum">Fitzwilliam Museum</a>, including paintings by <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Cézanne</a>, <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">Manet</a>, <a href="Augustus%20John">Augustus John</a>, <a href="James%20Tissot">Tissot</a> and <a href="Jean%20Renoir">Renoir</a>.

Sadleir notes how Walpole's considerable income enabled him to indulge not only his love of art and of old books and manuscripts, but also philanthropy, particularly towards younger writers. Although Walpole enjoyed the limelight, he was secretive about his many acts of generosity to younger writers, with both encouragement and financial help. After his death some idea of the scale of his generosity was discovered. <a href="Osbert%20Sitwell">Osbert Sitwell</a> commented, "I don't think there was any younger writer of any worth who has not at one time or another received kindness of an active kind, and at a crucial moment, from Hugh". Hart-Davis lists thirty-eight authors from whom letters of gratitude were found among Walpole's correspondence; Sadleir writes of Walpole's "generous kindness to literary aspirants and to writers fallen on evil days... by immediate financial assistance, by prefaces freely supplied or by collaboration volunteered, by introductions and recommendations to likely publishers, Walpole relieved the distresses of authorship to a degree which will never be fully known." Agate, though himself the recipient of Walpole's generosity on occasion, thought it sometimes went too far: "Mr Walpole's large-heartedness gets him into all kinds of trouble. He is an inveterate patter. He pats on the back young men whom sterner critics would knock down, because even in fantastic incompetence he perceives the good intention. No art or artist is safe from Mr Walpole's benevolence".

In his adopted home of Keswick a section of the <a href="Keswick%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">town museum</a> was dedicated to Walpole's memory in 1949, with manuscripts, correspondence, paintings and sculpture from Brackenburn, donated by his sister and brother.

Walpole's books cover a wide range. His fiction includes short stories, <a href="bildungsroman">bildungsroman</a>e ("Mr Perrin and Mr Traill", 1911, and the "Jeremy" trilogy) that delve into the psychology of boyhood; <a href="gothic%20horror">gothic horror</a> novels ("Portrait of a Man with Red Hair", 1925, and "The Killer and The Slain", 1942); ghost stories ("All Souls' Night", 1933); a period family saga (the Herries chronicle) and even detective fiction ("<a href="The%20Scoop%20and%20Behind%20the%20Screen">Behind the Screen</a>"). He wrote literary biographies (Conrad, 1916; <a href="James%20Branch%20Cabell">James Branch Cabell</a>, 1920; and Trollope, 1928); plays; and screenplays including "David Copperfield", 1935.

Walpole's debt to Henry James is discernible in "The Duchess of Wrexe" (1914) and "The Green Mirror" (1917), but in the view of <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">JBPriestley</a> the two most potent influences on Walpole were the highly contrasting ones of Trollope and <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoyevsky">Dostoyevsky</a>. Other critics noted the Trollopian influence; in 1923 <a href="Arthur%20St.%20John%20Adcock">Arthur St John Adcock</a> commented:

Walpole, though he was devoted to the works of Trollope, and published a study of him, thought that there was no real comparison between the two of them: "I am far too twisted and fantastic a novelist ever to succeed in catching Trollope's marvellous normality." Priestley was less impressed by the supposed Trollopian side of Walpole's work, finding some of it formulaic. He was more taken with a darker, Dostoyevskian, side that he found in the writing: "suddenly it will transform the pleasant easy scene he is giving us into transparency behind which are bright stars and red hellfire ... No matter how jolly and zestful he may appear to be, the fact remains that he possesses an unusually sharp sense of evil."

Possibly the most pervasive influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism is reflected in much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he liked to think of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.

Walpole sought critical as well as financial success, and longed to write works that equalled those of Trollope, <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a> and Henry James. In his early days, he received frequent and generally approving scrutiny from major literary figures. He was a good friend of <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>, and rated her as an influence; she praised his gift for seizing on telling detail: "it is no disparagement to a writer to say that his gift is for the small things rather than for the large ... If you are faithful with the details the large effects will grow inevitably out of those very details". Joseph Conrad said of him, "We see Mr. Walpole grappling with the truth of things spiritual and material with his characteristic earnestness, and we can discern the characteristics of this acute and sympathetic explorer of human nature." In 1928 Priestley observed,

Priestley contended that Walpole had fulfilled his early potential, unlike Compton Mackenzie, Gilbert Cannan and other promising young novelists of his generation. This view was not universal among critics: Walpole sometimes divided opinion. Writing of Walpole's Russian novels the contemporary critic and novelist <a href="Douglas%20Goldring">Douglas Goldring</a> commented, "Russia has been the grave of many reputations; and our Napoleon of the drawing-room novel has fared no better than other would-be conquerors of that disconcerting land." Goldring's complaint was that Walpole's Russian (and English) characters were clichéd stereotypes. The reviewer in "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>", by contrast, wrote, "I consulted a Russian, who is very much alive, and received the opinion that, if Mr. Walpole has not succeeded in drawing the real average Russian, he has given us a type whose faults and virtues sound the keynote of the situation as it is to-day." "The Observer" rated "The Dark Forest" as "one of the finest novels of our generation".
In 1924 <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> wrote into a short story a comparison of <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> and Walpole, concluding that the former was the better man, the latter a better writer and both were classics. Walpole could be sensitive about his literary reputation and often took adverse criticism badly. When <a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a> praised <a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse">P.G.Wodehouse</a> as the best English writer of their day, Walpole took it amiss, to the amusement of Wodehouse who regarded Belloc's plaudit as "a gag, to get a rise out of serious-minded authors whom he disliked". Wodehouse was not a great admirer of Walpole; his own scrupulous craftsmanship, with drafts polished over and over again, was the opposite of Walpole's hastily written and seldom-revised prose. He also viewed Walpole's sensitivity to criticism as absurd. Walpole was not always as oversensitive as Wodehouse supposed. The critic James Agate was a friend despite his regular rude remarks about Walpole's prose, and when Walpole discovered that Agate had written a spoof of the Herries "Lakeland" style, he made him promise to print it in the next published volume of his diaries.

During his career contemporaries saw both negative and positive sides to Walpole's outgoing nature and desire to be in the public eye. Wodehouse commented, "I always think Hugh Walpole's reputation was two thirds publicity. He was always endorsing books and speaking at lunches and so on." On the other hand, Walpole stood out as one of the few literary figures willing to go into court and give evidence for the defence at the obscenity trial after the novel "<a href="The%20Well%20of%20Loneliness">The Well of Loneliness</a>" was published.

By the time of his death "The Times"s estimation of Walpole was no higher than, "he had a versatile imagination; he could tell a workmanlike story in good workmanlike English; and he was a man of immense industry, conscientious and painstaking". The belittling tone of the obituary brought forth strong rebuttals from <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T S Eliot</a>, Kenneth Clark and Priestley, among others. Within a few years of his death, Walpole was seen as old-fashioned, and his works were largely neglected. In the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>" Elizabeth Steele summed up: "His psychology was not deep enough for the polemicist, his diction not free enough for those returning from war, and his zest disastrous to a public wary of personal commitment". In 2011, <a href="Peter%20Hitchens">Peter Hitchens</a>, an admirer of Walpole, though not an uncritical one, wrote:

Walpole's works have not been completely neglected in recent years. The Herries stories have seldom been out of print, and in 2014 <a href="WorldCat">WorldCat</a> listed a dozen recent reissues of Walpole's works, including "The Wooden Horse", "The Dark Forest", "The Secret City", "Jeremy", and "The Cathedral". In 2011 the BBC broadcast a reappraisal of Walpole, "The Walpole Chronicle", presented by <a href="Eric%20Robson">Eric Robson</a>. In 2013 a new stage version of "Rogue Herries" was presented by the <a href="Theatre%20by%20the%20Lake">Theatre by the Lake</a> company in Walpole's adopted home of Keswick. The BBC speculated that this could mark a revival in interest in his works.

Two full-length studies of Walpole were published after his death. The first, in 1952, was written by <a href="Rupert%20Hart-Davis">Rupert Hart-Davis</a>, who had known Walpole personally. It was regarded at the time as "among the half dozen best biographies of the century" and has been reissued several times since its first publication. Writing when homosexual acts between men were still outlawed in England, Hart-Davis avoided direct mention of his subject's sexuality, so respecting Walpole's habitual discretion and the wishes of his brother and sister. He left readers to read between the lines if they wished, in, for example, references to Turkish baths "providing informal opportunities of meeting interesting strangers". Hart-Davis dedicated the book to "Dorothy, Robin and Harold", Walpole's sister, brother, and long-term companion.

In 1972 Elizabeth Steele's study of Walpole was published. Much shorter than Hart-Davis's biography, at 178 pages to his 503, it dealt mainly with the novels, and aimed "to show the sources of Hugh Walpole's success as a writer during the thirty-five years and fifty books of his busy career". Steele concentrated on half a dozen of Walpole's best books, each illustrating aspects of his writing, under the headings "Acolyte", "Artist", "Witness", "Evangelist", "Critic" and "Romanticist". Steele also wrote a study of Walpole's North American lecture tours (2006) and the article on Walpole in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" (2004), which treats his private life briefly but candidly.

Alleyway (video game)

The name "Alleyway" references the in-game gateway that the player's spaceship (represented as a paddle) must pass through. While "Alleyway" is a portable clone of "<a href="Breakout%20%28video%20game%29">Breakout</a>", it adds several new features, including alternating stages, bonus rounds, and hazards for the player at later levels. While the game's original box art featured an unidentifiable protagonist, later international releases of the game replaced the character with <a href="Mario">Mario</a>. "Alleyway" was released with limited advertising, receiving moderate to low scores from reviewers who compared it to games like "<a href="Arkanoid">Arkanoid</a>".

The player's objective in "Alleyway" is to clear all bricks in each stage using a ball and paddle while keeping the ball from falling into the pit below, similar to that of "Breakout". The paddle's speed can be adjusted by holding either the B or A button on the controller while moving the paddle, which can move only horizontally at a fixed height. At the start of each life, the player can reposition the paddle before releasing the ball and commencing gameplay. When released, the ball will always begin at a 45° angle above the paddle aimed toward its center. The player starts the game with five paddles; each time the ball falls into the pit below the paddle, a paddle is removed and the ball is reset.

The game ends when all the player's paddles are depleted. An additional paddle is granted for every 1000 points scored until the player has over 10,000 points. The player may have up to nine paddles at once. The game lacks a <a href="continue%20%28video%20gaming%29">continue feature</a>, though the high score will be retained until the game is <a href="Reset%20%28computing%29">reset</a> or turned off. As there is no battery-backed <a href="Random%20access%20memory">SaveRAM</a> or <a href="password">password</a> feature, "Alleyway" can only be completed in one sitting on the Game Boy. This was later changed with the re-release of the game for the Nintendo 3DS's <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> system, which allowed for in-game progress to be recorded to a single <a href="save%20state">save state</a> accessible at any time while playing the game.

The ball will only travel at 15°, 30°, or 45° angles. If the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears and the ball <a href="ricochet">ricochet</a>s in a different direction at the same angle. The ball's speed depends on the type of brick that it hits: gray and black bricks increase its speed, while white and square, indestructible bricks have no effect. A sound effect is also played when the ball collides with an object or wall, with walls producing the lowest <a href="pitch%20%28music%29">pitch</a> and black bricks the highest.

The ball's direction and speed can be controlled by the paddle's velocity and point of contact. Changing direction the moment the ball comes into contact with the paddle, called a "snap technique", will bounce the ball upward with increased speed. Moving the paddle quickly in the opposite direction than the ball is headed will result in the ball bouncing in the same horizontal direction as the paddle at a 15° angle. If the player contacts the ball with the body of the paddle before it falls into the pit below, it will bounce back into the playing field. However, if instead, either corner of the paddle collides with the ball at that moment, it will be knocked directly into the pit.

"Alleyway"s ball cannot be locked in an <a href="infinite%20loop">infinite loop</a> of ricochets. Whenever the ball starts to loop between objects such as the ceiling, indestructible blocks and/or the paddle itself, its velocity will change at a random point after the second cycle on its next collision. As a result, the ball will travel at a slightly raised or lowered angle depending on its current <a href="trajectory">trajectory</a>, and will break out of the loop.

The game features 24 levels, based on eight block patterns in groups of three. After every three regular stages, the player proceeds to a <a href="bonus%20stage">bonus stage</a>, giving the game a total of 32 levels. Most levels follow a generic design, though one group is modeled after <a href="Mario">Mario</a>'s head as it appears next to the remaining paddles icon. The player progresses to the next level once all bricks are destroyed, where the same pattern of bricks appears but behaves differently. Every second stage is a "Scrolling Block Screen", featuring bricks that move from left to right; every third is an "Advancing Block Screen", where the bricks move downward the height of one regular brick in short bursts, increasing in speed as the ball bounces off the paddle. Any part of a brick below a height of ten bricks above the paddle is automatically removed; thus they cannot impede the player's movement but cannot contribute towards the player's score either.

As the player progresses through patterns, new elements are added to the gameplay. After the fourth stage, if the ball comes into contact with the top of the area, the paddle's size is halved until the stage is cleared or a life is lost. From this point on, the third stage variant features hidden bricks above the ceiling that descend progressively, using a similar—or same—layout that must also be cleared, meaning the pattern must be cleared twice. In later levels, bricks in the second stage variant may not move at the same speed or in the same direction. After the twelfth stage, indestructible bricks are incorporated into the brick patterns.

Bonus stages feature patterns based on various <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>" <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a>, such as a <a href="Piranha%20Plant">Piranha Plant</a>, <a href="Goomba">Goomba</a> or <a href="Bowser%20%28character%29">Bowser</a>. Unlike regular levels, the ball will destroy blocks in these stages without ricocheting off them, and contact with the ceiling will not affect the paddle size. These stages are the only ones to feature <a href="Background%20music%23Anime%2C%20video%20game%20and%20blog%20music">background music</a> during play, and cannot be <a href="Breakpoint">paused</a>. A timer is present for each bonus stage; it starts at 95 for the first and is reduced by five for each subsequent bonus stage completed beforehand. If the timer ends, the ball falls into the pit (no life is lost in this case), or all bricks are destroyed, the bonus stage ends. Destroying all bricks before the timer expires yields additional bonus points, which vary depending on the level. Once cleared, the brick pattern changes and gameplay reverts to the normal cycle. After finishing the final bonus round, the player is given a congratulations screen using the Mario graphic from the original "<a href="Mario%20Bros.">Mario Bros.</a>" game. The game then loops back to the first stage, allowing for infinite play.

Points are awarded for destroying bricks based on their <a href="Tints%20and%20shades">shade</a>, with one point awarded for the lightest and three for the darkest. The player may earn additional points for completing the bonus stages, with the bonus starting at 500 for the first and reaching 1500 for the last five. The player's <a href="high%20score">highest obtained score</a> is recorded until the game is turned off.

The game only displays four digits of the player's score, yet it has a maximum value of <a href="65535%20%28number%29%23In%20computing">65,535</a>. Scores of 10,000 and above are displayed as a combination of icons and the numerical display. For every 10,000 points, a sprite from the NES "Super Mario Bros." game is shown below the numerical score. A fire flower is shown for 10,000 points, a mushroom for 20,000, and a starman for 30,000 points and above. The game stops changing the sprite after awarding the starman icon. As a result, the highest score that can be displayed is 39,999; however, the maximum score of 65,535 is shown as 35,535. Once the maximum score has been reached, the score will <a href="Wrapping%20%28overflow%29">roll over</a> only if the player completes a bonus stage. A rollover does not affect the recorded high score.

Based on classic ball-and-paddle arcade games such as "Breakout" and "Arkanoid", "Alleyway" was a launch title for the Game Boy in 1989 for Japan and North America, alongside "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Land">Super Mario Land</a>", "<a href="Baseball%20%281983%20video%20game%29">Baseball</a>", and "<a href="Tetris%20%28Game%20Boy%29">Tetris</a>", though only with the first two in Japan. The game's release predates "Tetris" by two months, due to legal battles between Nintendo and <a href="Tengen%20%28company%29">Tengen</a> over the Tetris property. On June 6, 2011, the game was re-released as a launch title for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> system via <a href="online%20distribution">online distribution</a>. It was first released in Japan, and then North America a year later.

"Alleyway" marks one of the first appearances of Mario on the Game Boy system alongside "Super Mario Land", although its original <a href="box%20art">box</a> and cartridge art showed an unidentified character in a <a href="spacesuit">spacesuit</a> piloting the paddle. The artwork was changed to show Mario at the controls on the game's international release, but neither the manual nor the back of the box refer to the Nintendo mascot's presence in the game. "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>"s preview made no mention of Mario in the title other than note of the pattern of bricks in Mario's shape for the first bonus level. Official confirmation of the pilot being Mario only came about in 1990 with "<a href="Club%20Nintendo">Club Nintendo</a>"s preview of the game's European release.

The game was one of the first titles made by the <a href="Nintendo%20Research%20%26amp%3B%20Development%201">Nintendo R&D1</a> development team, alongside "Tetris" and "<a href="Radar%20Mission">Radar Mission</a>". Years later, the game's designer <a href="Gunpei%20Yokoi">Gunpei Yokoi</a> would reuse much of "Alleyway"s <a href="source%20code">source code</a> (such as paddle behavior and adapted <a href="physics%20engine">physics engine</a>) for the Game Boy game "<a href="Kirby%27s%20Block%20Ball">Kirby's Block Ball</a>" while working with <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>'s team. "Alleyway" was re-released for download onto the <a href="Nintendo%20Power%20%28cartridge%29">Nintendo Power cartridge</a>, occupying one memory block on the device.

Promotion of the title in Nintendo published material consisted of a segment taking up a third of the page the articles were on. Advertisements for "Alleyway" were grouped with those for the Game Boy itself and other titles for the system. Years after its initial release, a two-page section in the "<a href="Super%20Game%20Boy">Super Game Boy</a> Nintendo Strategy Guide" bundled with the "Super Game Boy" accessory appeared, which gave advice and color codes for the game.

Although "Alleyway" sold well enough during its production run, it has not been re-released as a Nintendo <a href="Player%27s%20Choice">Player's Choice</a> title, and reviews of the game have been mostly mixed to negative. "<a href="Mean%20Machines">Mean Machines</a>" gave the game a score of 33%, criticizing its repetitiveness and stating "this variant doesn't have much more to offer than the original ["Breakout"]". The magazine's staff added "once you've finished a couple of screens, you'll be bored stiff" and compared the game to its predecessor, "Arkanoid", regarding the lack of <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s in "Alleyway". "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" staff also reviewed the game, with four separate reviews giving the game scores of 6/10, 6/10, 5/10, and 3/10. All four reviewers compared it to "Arkanoid", complaining about the lack of enhancement over the "Breakout" format. <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> shared the sentiment in their review of the 3DS re-release, with reviewer Nathan Meunier giving it a score of 5/10 and stating "Alleyway wasn't so hot when it first came out, and it still pales when put it side-by-side to other similarly priced offerings". He further added at times the game appeared to "hate" the player with its difficulty, though acknowledged that the addition of save states "takes some of the sting out of losing". "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>"s Darran Jones called it "pretty piss-poor all the way back in 1989", noting the bland levels and lack of power-ups found in "Arkanoid", and that many similar clones had outperformed it.

Not all comments about the game have been negative. The two "Electronic Gaming Monthly" reviewers that gave the highest scores did state they felt the design was perfect for the Game Boy, one adding "It's also a very good game that combines some new features ... with the original Break-Out theme" and concluding "Alleyway is good—but a bit long". German magazine "Power Play" gave the game a rating of 48%, but also praised the game's level variety. The book "<a href="Rules%20of%20Play">Rules of Play</a>" discusses the game as an example of improved <a href="design">design</a> over a base core mechanic, citing the inclusion of distinct sound effects for ball collision as a means to praise the player for destroying bricks, and the varied level designs as "well done" and giving the player "an element of discovery to the overall experience." <a href="Allgame">Allgame</a> noted that despite the simplicity and variety, "Alleyway is fun to play", further adding that games of its kind "always play well on the Game Boy".

Nigel Kneale

Thomas Nigel Kneale (18 April 1922 – 29 October 2006) was a British <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a>. He wrote professionally for more than 50 years, was a winner of the <a href="Somerset%20Maugham%20Award">Somerset Maugham Award</a>, and was twice nominated for the <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20British%20Screenplay">BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay</a>. In 2000, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the <a href="Horror%20Writers%20Association">Horror Writers Association</a>.

Predominantly a writer of <a href="Thriller%20%28genre%29">thrillers</a> that used <a href="science-fiction">science-fiction</a> and <a href="Horror%20fiction">horror</a> elements, he was best known for the creation of the character <a href="Bernard%20Quatermass">Professor Bernard Quatermass</a>. Quatermass was a heroic scientist who appeared in various television, film and radio productions written by Kneale for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer Film Productions</a> and <a href="Thames%20Television">Thames Television</a> between 1953 and 1996. Kneale wrote original scripts and successfully adapted works by writers such as <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>, <a href="John%20Osborne">John Osborne</a>, <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> and <a href="Susan%20Hill">Susan Hill</a>.

He was most active in television, joining <a href="BBC%20Television">BBC Television</a> in 1951; his final script was transmitted on <a href="ITV%20Network">ITV</a> in 1997. Kneale wrote well-received television dramas such as "<a href="The%20Year%20of%20the%20Sex%20Olympics">The Year of the Sex Olympics</a>" (1968) and "<a href="The%20Stone%20Tape">The Stone Tape</a>" (1972) in addition to the "Quatermass" serials. He has been described as "one of the most influential writers of the 20th century," and as "having invented popular TV."

Kneale was born Thomas Nigel Kneale in <a href="Barrow-in-Furness">Barrow-in-Furness</a>, England. His family came from the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, and returned to live there in 1928, when Kneale was six years old. He was raised in the island's capital, <a href="Douglas%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Douglas</a>, where his father was the owner and editor of the local newspaper, "The Herald". He was educated at <a href="St%20Ninian%27s%20High%20School%2C%20Douglas">St Ninian's High School, Douglas</a>, and after leaving studied law, training to become an <a href="advocate">advocate</a> at the Manx Bar. He also worked in a <a href="lawyer">lawyer</a>'s office, but became bored with his legal training and eventually abandoned the profession. At the beginning of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> Kneale attempted to enlist in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>, but was deemed medically unfit for service owing to <a href="photophobia">photophobia</a>, from which he had suffered since childhood.

On 25 March 1946 Kneale made his first broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a>, performing a <a href="Live%20radio">live</a> reading of his own <a href="short%20story">short story</a> "Tomato Cain" in a strand entitled "Stories by Northern Authors" on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s <a href="Northern%20England">North of England</a> <a href="BBC%20Home%20Service">Home Service</a> region. Later that year he left the Isle of Man and moved to London, where he began studying acting at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> (RADA). He made further radio broadcasts in the 1940s, including a reading of his story "Zachary Crebbin's Angel" on the <a href="BBC%20Light%20Programme">BBC Light Programme</a>, broadcast nationally on 19 May 1948. He also had further short stories published in magazines such as "<a href="Argosy%20%28UK%20magazine%29">Argosy</a>" and "<a href="Strand%20Magazine">The Strand</a>". He began using the name "Nigel Kneale" for these professional credits, but continued to be known as "Tom" to his family and friends up until his death.

After graduating from RADA, Kneale worked for a short time as a professional actor performing in small rôles at the <a href="Shakespeare%20Memorial%20Theatre">Stratford Memorial Theatre</a> in <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a>. He continued to write in his spare time and in 1949 a collection of his work, entitled "Tomato Cain and Other Stories", was published. The book sufficiently impressed the writer <a href="Elizabeth%20Bowen">Elizabeth Bowen</a> that she wrote a <a href="foreword">foreword</a> for it, and in 1950 the collection won the <a href="Somerset%20Maugham%20Award">Somerset Maugham Award</a>. (His son, <a href="Matthew%20Kneale">Matthew Kneale</a>, would later win the same award in 1988 for his novel "Whore Banquets".)

Following this success, Kneale gave up acting to write full-time. He did take small <a href="voice-over">voice-over</a> roles in some of his 1950s <a href="television">television</a> productions, such as the voice heard on the factory <a href="loudspeaker">loudspeaker</a> system in "<a href="Quatermass%20II">Quatermass II</a>" (1955), for which he also <a href="Narrator">narrated</a> most of the <a href="%3Awikt%3Arecapitulation">recaps</a> shown at the beginning of each episode. Kneale's publisher was keen for him to write a novel, but Kneale himself was more interested in writing for television. A keen cinema-goer, he believed that the audience being able to see human faces was an important factor in storytelling.

His first professional <a href="Playwright">script writing</a> credit came when he wrote the <a href="radio%20drama">radio drama</a> "The Long Stairs", broadcast by the BBC on 1 March 1950 and based on an historical <a href="mining">mining</a> disaster on the Isle of Man. In 1951 he was recruited as one of the first staff writers to be employed by <a href="BBC%20Television">BBC Television</a>; before he started working for the BBC, Kneale had never seen any television. Kneale was initially a general-purpose writer, working on adaptations of books and stage plays and even writing material for <a href="light%20entertainment">light entertainment</a> and <a href="children%27s%20television%20series">children's programmes</a>. The following year, <a href="Michael%20Barry%20%28television%20producer%29">Michael Barry</a> became the Head of Drama at BBC Television, and spent his entire first year's script budget of £250 to hire Kneale as a full-time writer for the drama department. Kneale's first credited role in adult television drama was providing "additional dialogue" for the play "<a href="Arrow%20to%20the%20Heart">Arrow to the Heart</a>", broadcast on 20 July 1952. This play was adapted and directed by the Austrian <a href="television%20director">television director</a> <a href="Rudolph%20Cartier">Rudolph Cartier</a>, who had also joined the staff of the BBC drama department in 1952. It was the beginning of a successful working relationship between the pair, that would lead to some of Kneale's best known work.

Neither Kneale nor Cartier was impressed with the state in which they found BBC television drama. At his initial job interview with Michael Barry, Cartier had criticised the department's output as being too sedate and theatrical, while Kneale was frustrated at what he saw as the slow and boring styles of television drama production then employed, which he felt wasted the potential of the medium. Together they would help to revolutionise British television drama and establish it as an entity separate from its theatre and radio equivalents; the television historian Lez Cooke wrote in 2003 that "Between them, Kneale and Cartier were responsible for introducing a completely new dimension to television drama in the early to mid-1950s." 

Jason Jacobs, a lecturer in <a href="Film%20studies">film</a> and <a href="television%20studies">television studies</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Warwick">University of Warwick</a>, wrote in his 2000 history of early British television drama that "It was the arrival of Nigel Kneale ... and Rudolph Cartier ... that challenged the intimate drama directly ... Kneale and Cartier shared a common desire to invigorate television with a faster tempo and a broader thematic and spatial canvas, and it was no coincidence that they turned to science-fiction in order to get out of the dominant stylistic trend of television intimacy."

The science-fiction production to which Jacobs referred was "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Experiment">The Quatermass Experiment</a>", broadcast in six half-hour episodes in July and August 1953. The serial told the story of Professor <a href="Bernard%20Quatermass">Bernard Quatermass</a> of the British Experimental Rocket Group, and the consequences of his sending the first manned mission into space when a terrible fate befalls the crew and only one returns. "The Quatermass Experiment" was the first adult television science-fiction production, held a large television audience gripped across its six weeks, and has been described by the <a href="Museum%20of%20Broadcast%20Communications">Museum of Broadcast Communications</a> as dramatising "a new range of gendered fears about Britain's postwar and post-colonial security." Kneale was inspired in choosing the character's unusual surname by the fact that many Manx surnames began with "Qu"; the actual name itself was picked from a London <a href="telephone%20directory">telephone directory</a>. The Professor's first name was chosen in honour of the <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Bernard%20Lovell">Bernard Lovell</a>.

The BBC recognised the success of the serial, particularly in the context of the impending arrival of <a href="commercial%20television">commercial television</a> to the UK. Controller of Programmes <a href="Cecil%20McGivern">Cecil McGivern</a> wrote in a memo that: "Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while ["The Quatermass Experiment"] lasted. We are going to need "many" more 'Quatermass Experiment' programmes." Like all of Kneale's television work for the BBC in the 1950s, "The Quatermass Experiment" was transmitted <a href="live%20television">live</a>. Only the first two episodes were <a href="Telerecording">telerecorded</a> and survive in the BBC's archives.

Kneale and Cartier next collaborated on an adaptation of "<a href="Wuthering%20Heights">Wuthering Heights</a>" (broadcast 6 December 1953) and then on a version of <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s novel "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four%20%28UK%20TV%20programme%29">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>" (12 December 1954). "Nineteen Eighty-Four" was a particularly notable production; many found it shocking, and questions were asked in <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">Parliament</a> about whether some of the scenes had been suitable for television. There was also prominent support for the play; the <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a> made it known that he and <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">the Queen</a> had watched and enjoyed the programme, and the second live performance on 16 December gained the largest television audience since her <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">coronation</a> the previous year. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" newspaper's obituary of Kneale in 2006 claimed that the adaptation had "permanently revived Orwell's reputation," while the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> included it in their list of the <a href="100%20Greatest%20British%20Television%20Programmes">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a> of the 20th century in 2000.

"The Creature"—an original script by Kneale concerning the legend of the <a href="abominable%20snowman">abominable snowman</a>—was his next collaboration with Cartier, broadcast on 30 January 1955, followed by an adaptation of <a href="Peter%20Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a>'s play "The Moment of Truth" (10 March 1955), before Kneale was commissioned to write "<a href="Quatermass%20II">Quatermass II</a>". Specifically designed by the BBC to combat the threat of the new <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> network, which launched just a month before "Quatermass II" was shown, the serial was even more successful than the first, drawing audiences of up to nine million viewers. Kneale was inspired in writing the serial by contemporary fears over secret <a href="UK%20Ministry%20of%20Defence">UK Ministry of Defence</a> research establishments such as <a href="Porton%20Down">Porton Down</a>, as well the fact that as a BBC staff writer he had been required to sign the <a href="Official%20Secrets%20Act">Official Secrets Act</a>.

Almost simultaneously with the transmission of "Quatermass II" in the autumn of 1955, <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer Film Productions</a> released "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Xperiment">The Quatermass Xperiment</a>", their film adaptation of the first serial. Kneale was not pleased with the film, and particularly disliked the casting of <a href="Brian%20Donlevy">Brian Donlevy</a> as Quatermass, as he explained in a 1986 interview. "[Donlevy] was then really on the skids and didn't care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of take the money and run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle."

"Quatermass II" was Kneale's final original script for the BBC as a staff writer. He left the corporation when his contract expired at the end of 1956; "Five years in that hut was as much as any sane person could stand," he later told an interviewer. But he continued to write for the BBC on a <a href="freelance">freelance</a> basis.

The same year that he left the BBC, Kneale wrote his first feature film <a href="screenplay">screenplay</a>, adapting "<a href="Quatermass%20II">Quatermass II</a>" for Hammer Film Productions along with <a href="film%20producer">producer</a> <a href="Anthony%20Hinds">Anthony Hinds</a> and <a href="film%20director">director</a> <a href="Val%20Guest">Val Guest</a>. Hinds and Guest had overseen the first "Quatermass" film, upon which Kneale had been unable to work due to his BBC staff contract. Kneale was disappointed that Brian Donlevy also returned in the role of Quatermass. The film premiered at the end of May 1957, and was reviewed positively in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>": "The writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally." 1957 also saw the release of another cinematic collaboration between Kneale and Guest, when Kneale adapted his 1955 BBC play "The Creature" into "<a href="The%20Abominable%20Snowman%20%28film%29">The Abominable Snowman</a>"; in this case, Hammer retained the star of the BBC version, <a href="Peter%20Cushing">Peter Cushing</a>.

In May 1957, Kneale was contracted by the BBC to write a third "Quatermass" serial, and this was eventually transmitted as "<a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit">Quatermass and the Pit</a>" across six weeks in December 1958 and January 1959. On this occasion Kneale was inspired by the racial tensions that had recently been seen in the United Kingdom, and which came to a head while the serial was in <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a> when the <a href="Notting%20Hill%20race%20riots">Notting Hill race riots</a> occurred in August and September 1958. Drawing audiences of up to 11 million, "Quatermass and the Pit" has been referred to by the <a href="bbc.co.uk">BBC's own website</a> as "simply the first finest thing the BBC ever made." It was also included in the British Film Institute's "TV 100" list in 2000, where it was praised for the themes and subtexts it explored. "In a story which mined mythology and folklore ... under the guise of genre it tackled serious themes of man's hostile nature and the military's perversion of science for its own ends."

Despite the success of the serial, Kneale felt that he had now taken the character of Quatermass as far as he could. "I didn't want to go on repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that seemed to me to be quite enough," he said in 1986. It was also his final new collaboration with Rudolph Cartier, although the director did later handle a new version of Kneale's 1953 adaptation of "Wuthering Heights" for the BBC in 1962.

In 1958, Kneale's play "Mrs Wickens in the Fall", transmitted by the BBC the previous year, was remade by the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> network in the United States, retitled "The Littlest Enemy". Broadcast on 18 June as part of "<a href="The%20United%20States%20Steel%20Hour">The United States Steel Hour</a>" anthology series, the script was severely cut back in length. It was Kneale's only involvement with American television, and he was not pleased with the result. "I made up my mind I would never ever again have anything done on a television network in America," he later commented.

For the next few years, Kneale concentrated mostly on film screenplays, adapting plays and novels for the cinema. Described by "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" as "one of the few writers not to fall out with <a href="John%20Osborne">John Osborne</a>," Kneale adapted Osborne's plays "<a href="Look%20Back%20in%20Anger">Look Back in Anger</a>" and "<a href="The%20Entertainer%20%28film%29">The Entertainer</a>" in 1958 and 1960 respectively, both for director <a href="Tony%20Richardson">Tony Richardson</a>. Kneale knew Richardson through having previously adapted a <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov</a> short story for the BBC, which Richardson had directed. Kneale was nominated for the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Film Award</a> (later known as a BAFTA) for Best Screenplay for both films. <a href="Film%20producer">Film producer</a> <a href="Harry%20Saltzman">Harry Saltzman</a>, who had produced the two Osborne adaptations, approached Kneale about scripting a project he was working on to adapt <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>'s <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> novels for the cinema; Kneale was not a fan of Fleming's work and turned the offer down. Further adaptations Kneale did work on were "<a href="H.M.S.%20Defiant">H.M.S. Defiant</a>" (1962, from the novel "Mutiny" by <a href="Frank%20Tilsley">Frank Tilsley</a>) and "<a href="First%20Men%20in%20the%20Moon%20%281964%20film%29">First Men in the Moon</a>" (1964, from <a href="The%20First%20Men%20in%20the%20Moon">the novel</a> by <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>).

Less successfully during this period, Kneale completed screenplays for adaptations of the novels "<a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Flies">Lord of the Flies</a>" by <a href="William%20Golding">William Golding</a> and "<a href="Brave%20New%20World">Brave New World</a>" by <a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a>. Neither of these scripts ever saw production, as the companies making them went out of business—Kneale commented in a 2003 interview that "I reckon I closed down at least two film companies." Another screenplay that went unproduced was a Kneale original, a drama involving a wave of <a href="teenage%20suicide">teenage suicide</a>s called "The Big Giggle", or "The Big, Big Giggle". Written in 1965 while Kneale was suffering from a mystery illness and forced to stay in bed for a long period, the concept started life as a drama serial for the BBC, before the corporation had second thoughts about the nature of the storyline and the possibility of <a href="copycat%20suicide">copycat suicide</a>s; Kneale later agreed that they were probably right not to make it for television. The production was nearly made as a film by <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>, but <a href="John%20Trevelyan%20%28censor%29">John Trevelyan</a>, Chief Executive of the <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">British Board of Film Censors</a>, forbade the script's production.

In 1966 Kneale worked again for Hammer Film Productions when he adapted <a href="Norah%20Lofts">Norah Lofts</a>'s 1960 novel "The Devil's Own" into the <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> "<a href="The%20Witches%20%281966%20film%29">The Witches</a>". Kneale had first worked on the screenplay for the adaptation in 1961, the same year in which he had begun to adapt "Quatermass and the Pit" for Hammer. Like "The Witches", the <a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit%20%28film%29">film version of "Quatermass and the Pit"</a> took several years to reach the screen, eventually being released in 1967. <a href="Roy%20Ward%20Baker">Roy Ward Baker</a> directed, with <a href="Andrew%20Keir">Andrew Keir</a> starring as Quatermass. Kneale was much happier with this version than the previous Hammer Quatermass adaptations, and the film was described by "The Independent" in 2006 as "one of the best ever Hammer productions." "Quatermass and the Pit" was Kneale's final credited film work; 1979's "<a href="Quatermass%20%28TV%20serial%29">The Quatermass Conclusion</a>" was only released to cinemas in overseas markets after having been made for television in the UK, and he had his name removed from the credits of "" (1982).

Kneale had returned to writing for television with the BBC for the first time since "Quatermass and the Pit" when his play "The Road" was broadcast in September 1963. The play concerned the population of an 18th-century village who become haunted by visions of a future <a href="Nuclear%20warfare">nuclear war</a>, and was followed by several further one-off dramas for the BBC over the following decade, including two entries into <a href="BBC%20One">BBC1</a>'s "<a href="The%20Wednesday%20Play">The Wednesday Play</a>" anthology strand. During this period he was regarded as one of the finest writers working for the BBC. Kneale did his first work for the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> network during this time, writing one-off play "The Crunch" for the ATV company in 1964.

A particular critical success was "<a href="The%20Year%20of%20the%20Sex%20Olympics">The Year of the Sex Olympics</a>", broadcast as part of <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC2</a>'s "<a href="Theatre%20625">Theatre 625</a>" series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work to be made in colour—although only a <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a> copy now survives—the story was based in a future where the majority of the population are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts of <a href="pornography">pornography</a> and other low-brow <a href="reality%20television">reality television</a> programming. "The Live Life Show", in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle to live on an isolated <a href="rural">rural</a> island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.

"The Year of the Sex Olympics" has been praised for its foreshadowing of the rise of reality television programmes such as "<a href="Big%20Brother%20%28TV%20series%29">Big Brother</a>" (1999–present) and "<a href="Celebrity%20Love%20Island">Celebrity Love Island</a>" (2005–2006). The critic <a href="Nancy%20Banks-Smith">Nancy Banks-Smith</a> wrote in 2003 that: "In "The Year of the Sex Olympics" [Kneale] foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome ... This is satire from a TV insider, but it mutates into something far more desolate and disorientating." The island locations scenes for the production were filmed on the Isle of Man, Kneale's homeland.

In 1965 Kneale had been approached by the producer of the BBC2 science-fiction anthology series "<a href="Out%20of%20the%20Unknown">Out of the Unknown</a>" to write a new one-off 75-minute "Quatermass" story for the programme. Nothing came of this, but seven years later he was commissioned by the BBC to write a new four-part "Quatermass" serial, based in a <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n near future world overrun with crime, apathy, <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> and youth <a href="cult">cult</a>s. The serial was announced as a forthcoming production by the BBC in November 1972, and some model filming was even begun in June 1973, but eventually budgetary problems and the unavailability of <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>—a central location in the scripts—led to the project's cancellation. "It lingered through the summer and slowly died as a project," he later commented.

Kneale's next script for the BBC was "<a href="The%20Stone%20Tape">The Stone Tape</a>", a scientific <a href="ghost%20story">ghost story</a> broadcast on Christmas Day 1972. Lez Cooke praised the production, when writing in 2003, describing it as "one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of "<a href="Play%20for%20Today">Play for Today</a>"." His final BBC work was an entry into a series called "Bedtime Stories", adapting traditional <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>s into adult dramas. Kneale's script, "Jack and the Beanstalk", was transmitted on 24 March 1974, and marked the end of his BBC writing career.

Kneale's remaining television work was written for ITV. His first script for ITV in this period was the one-off play "<a href="Murrain">Murrain</a>", made by the network's <a href="English%20Midlands">Midlands</a> franchise holders <a href="Associated%20TeleVision">Associated TeleVision</a> (ATV) in 1975. The play, a horror piece based around <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, led the following year to a series called "<a href="Beasts%20%28TV%20series%29">Beasts</a>", a six-part anthology where Kneale created six different character-based tales of horror and the macabre. It featured some well-known actors such as <a href="Martin%20Shaw">Martin Shaw</a>, <a href="Pauline%20Quirke">Pauline Quirke</a> and <a href="Bernard%20Horsfall">Bernard Horsfall</a>, but did not gain a full network run on ITV; different regions transmitted the episodes in different timeslots and some in different sequences.

In the mid-1970s, Kneale made his only attempt at writing a stage play. Called "Crow", it was based upon the memoirs of real-life Manx <a href="slave%20trade">slaver</a> Captain Hugh Crow. Kneale was unable to find backing to produce the play for the stage, but sold the script to ATV who put it into pre-production for television. However, shortly before filming it was cancelled by order of ATV's managing director, <a href="Lew%20Grade">Lew Grade</a>—Kneale was never told why.

Following the cancellation of "Crow", Kneale moved to work for another of the ITV companies, <a href="Thames%20Television">Thames Television</a>, who in 1977 commissioned the production of the scripts of Kneale's previously abandoned fourth "Quatermass" serial, to be produced by their <a href="Euston%20Films">Euston Films</a> subsidiary film company. The production was structured to work both as a four-episode serial for transmission in the UK, and a 100-minute film version for cinema release overseas—something Kneale later regretted agreeing to. Starring <a href="John%20Mills">John Mills</a> as Quatermass and with a budget of over £1 million—more than fifty times the budget of "Quatermass and the Pit" in 1958—the serial was not as critically successful as its predecessors. "Thematically no less awesome than Mr Kneale's earlier science-fiction essays for BBC Television, his ITV debut has proved only a so-so affair," was the verdict of "The Times" when previewing the final episode. Tying in with the series, Kneale returned to prose fiction when he wrote his only full-length novel, "Quatermass", a <a href="novelisation">novelisation</a> of the serial.

Kneale's next television series was a departure from his usual style—"<a href="Kinvig">Kinvig</a>", his sole attempt at writing a <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a>, produced by <a href="London%20Weekend%20Television">London Weekend Television</a> and broadcast on ITV in the autumn of 1981. Although his first out-and-out comedy, Kneale was keen to stress that there had always been elements of humour present throughout his scripts, and some of the press reaction to "<a href="Kinvig">Kinvig</a>" was positive. "If you like the idea of the "<a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy">Hitch-Hiker's Guide</a>" but found its realization tiresomely hysterical you may well prefer Kneale's relaxed wit. Cast splendid, direction deft," was "The Times"'s preview of the first episode. However, the series was not a success, although Kneale later remained personally pleased with it.

In 1982, Kneale made another one-off diversion from his usual work when he wrote his only produced <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> movie script, "". Kneale had initially been approached by the director <a href="John%20Landis">John Landis</a> to work on the screenplay for a <a href="remake">remake</a> of "<a href="Creature%20from%20the%20Black%20Lagoon">Creature from the Black Lagoon</a>", and he and his wife spent some time living at the <a href="Sheraton%20Hotel">Sheraton Hotel</a> in Hollywood while Kneale worked on the project. The "Black Lagoon" script never went into production, but while in America Kneale met the director <a href="Joe%20Dante">Joe Dante</a>, who invited him to script the third film in the <a href="Halloween%20%28franchise%29">"Halloween" series</a>, on which Dante was working. Kneale agreed, on the proviso that it would be a totally new concept unrelated to the first two films, which he had not seen and he did not like what he had heard about them.

Kneale's <a href="Film%20treatment">treatment</a> for the film met with the approval of <a href="John%20Carpenter">John Carpenter</a>, the producer of the "Halloween" series, although Kneale was required to write the script in only six weeks. Kneale got on well with the director assigned to the film, <a href="Tommy%20Lee%20Wallace">Tommy Lee Wallace</a>, but when one of the film's backers, <a href="Dino%20De%20Laurentiis">Dino De Laurentiis</a>, insisted upon the inclusion of more graphic violence and a rewrite of the script from Wallace, Kneale became displeased with the results and had his name removed from the film.

He returned to writing scripts for British television, including "Gentry" with <a href="Roger%20Daltrey">Roger Daltrey</a> for ITV in 1987, and the <a href="The%20Woman%20in%20Black%20%281989%20film%29">1989 adaptation</a> of <a href="Susan%20Hill">Susan Hill</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Woman%20in%20Black">The Woman in Black</a>" for transmission on ITV on Christmas Eve. <a href="Lynne%20Truss">Lynne Truss</a>, reviewing a <a href="Rerun">repeat</a> broadcast of the production on <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> for "The Times" in 1994, wrote that: "Clip-clop is not usually a noise to get upset about. But it will be an interesting test, today, to go up behind people and whisper 'clip-clop', to find out whether they saw "The Woman in Black" last night. People who made the bold decision to watch this excellent drama will respond to any 'clip-clop' by gratifyingly leaping in the air and grabbing the backs of their necks." The adaptation nearly went unmade; Kneale had written the script in ten days but been advised by his agent to wait before submitting it to the producers <a href="Central%20Independent%20Television">Central Independent Television</a> so that they would not think he had rushed it. When he did submit the script three weeks later, he discovered that Central had been about to cancel the production as they had assumed that Kneale, then 67, had not been able to complete the work due to his age.

Susan Hill herself did not like some of the changes that Kneale had made to "The Woman in Black". It has been observed that Kneale on some occasions operated a double standard with adaptations; being unhappy when others made changes to his stories, but willing to make changes to stories he was adapting into script form. Referring to "The Woman in Black" adaptation, the writer and critic <a href="Kim%20Newman">Kim Newman</a> noted that: "He was very offended at the notion of Susan Hill using the name of Kipps from HG Wells as the hero of "The Woman in Black", and so he decided not to use it and to change the hero's name to Kidd. I'm sure if somebody thought that Quatermass was a silly name and changed it, he'd be furious!" However, Kneale's adaptations were by no means always unpopular with the original author. In 1991, a <a href="Stanley%20and%20the%20Women">four-part version</a> he wrote of <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a>'s novel "<a href="Stanley%20and%20the%20Women%20%28novel%29">Stanley and the Women</a>", met with approval from the original author, with Amis regarding it as the most successful adaptation of any of his work.

Kneale also adapted "<a href="Sharpe%27s%20Gold%20%28TV%20programme%29">Sharpe's Gold</a>" for ITV in 1995, as part of their series of adaptations of <a href="Bernard%20Cornwell">Bernard Cornwell</a>'s "<a href="Sharpe%20%28TV%20series%29">Sharpe</a>" novels. This was an assignment that surprised his agent; "We didn't think he'd want to bother with them but he did. That was probably because he liked the producer." He returned to writing for radio for the first time since the 1950s in 1996, when he wrote the drama-documentary "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Memoirs">The Quatermass Memoirs</a>" for <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a>. Partly composed of Kneale looking back at the events that led to the writing of the original three "Quatermass" serials and using some archive material, there was also a dramatised strand to the series, set just before the ITV "Quatermass" serial and featuring <a href="Andrew%20Keir">Andrew Keir</a>, star of the Hammer version of "Quatermass and the Pit", as the Professor.

While recording an <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a> for that film in 1997, Kneale speculated about a possible "Quatermass" prequel set in 1930s <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. According to "The Independent", Kneale conceived a storyline involving the young Quatermass becoming involved in German rocketry experiments in the 1930s, and helping a young <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> woman to escape the country during the <a href="1936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Berlin Olympics</a>.

Kneale was invited to write for the successful American science-fiction series "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>" (1993–2002), but declined the offer. His final professional work was an episode of the ITV legal drama "<a href="Kavanagh%20QC">Kavanagh QC</a>", starring <a href="John%20Thaw">John Thaw</a>. Kneale's episode, "Ancient History", was about a Jewish woman who during the Second World War had been subjected to horrific experiments in a <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>. Transmitted on 17 January 1997 and cited as one of the programme's finest episodes, it brought Kneale's writing career to a close after more than fifty years.

He continued to appear as an interview subject in various television documentaries, and also recorded further audio commentaries for the release of some of his productions on <a href="DVD">DVD</a>. In 2005, he acted as a consultant when the <a href="digital%20television">digital television</a> channel <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> produced a live remake of "The Quatermass Experiment". He lived in <a href="Barnes%2C%20London">Barnes, London</a>, until his death on 29 October 2006 at the age of 84, following a series of small <a href="stroke">stroke</a>s.

The writer and actor <a href="Mark%20Gatiss">Mark Gatiss</a>, paying tribute to Kneale on the <a href="BBC%20News%20Online">BBC News Online</a> website shortly after his death, indicated that he was among the first rank of British television writers, but that this had been overlooked. "He is amongst the greats—he is absolutely as important as <a href="Dennis%20Potter">Dennis Potter</a>, as <a href="David%20Mercer%20%28playwright%29">David Mercer</a>, as <a href="Alan%20Bleasdale">Alan Bleasdale</a>, as <a href="Alan%20Bennett">Alan Bennett</a>, but I think because of a strange snobbery about fantasy or sci-fi it's never quite been that way." Similarly, his obituary in "The Guardian" commented that: Kneale was by no means the only author to have been largely wasted by television, and to have seen his status overtaken by <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> hacks. But his place is secure, alongside Wells, <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, <a href="John%20Wyndham">John Wyndham</a> and <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>, as one of the best, most exciting and most compassionate English science fiction writers of his century.

Writing about "The Year of the Sex Olympics" in 2003, Nancy Banks-Smith felt that Kneale was one of the few television writers whose work was particularly memorable. Once upon a time, <a href="Viscount%20Hailsham">Lord Hailsham</a>, proceeding to the chamber of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House</a> in black stockings and full-bottomed wig as <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord High Chancellor</a>, spotted a friend and cried lustily, "Neil!" They say a whole party of American tourists fell to their knees. At the name of Kneale, I feel, every knee should bow. How much TV do you remember from last night ... last year ... last century? Quite. Curiously, I can remember clearly the first time I saw "The Year of the Sex Olympics" by Nigel Kneale. It was 35 years ago.

Kneale was admired by the film director <a href="John%20Carpenter">John Carpenter</a>, who hired Kneale to write the screenplay "Halloween III". Carpenter wrote the screenplay for his 1987 film "<a href="Prince%20of%20Darkness%20%28film%29">Prince of Darkness</a>" under the <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a> "Martin Quatermass", a reference to Kneale's work. The <a href="horror%20fiction">horror fiction</a> writer <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> has cited Kneale as an influence, and Kim Newman suggested in 2003 that King had "more or less rewritten "Quatermass and the Pit" in "<a href="The%20Tommyknockers">The Tommyknockers</a>"." Other writers have acclaimed Kneale as an influence on their work including <a href="comic%20book">comics</a> writer <a href="Grant%20Morrison">Grant Morrison</a> and television <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a> <a href="Russell%20T%20Davies">Russell T Davies</a>, who described the "Beasts" episode "Baby" as "the most frightening thing I've ever seen ... Powerful stuff." Film screenwriter and director <a href="Dan%20O%27Bannon">Dan O'Bannon</a> was also an admirer of Kneale's writing, and in 1993 wrote a potential remake of "The Quatermass Experiment", of which Kneale approved, but the film was never made.

High-profile entertainment industry figures have publicly expressed admiration for Kneale's work, including <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' drummer <a href="Ringo%20Starr">Ringo Starr</a>, members of the rock group <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> and "<a href="Monty%20Python%27s%20Flying%20Circus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a>" writer/performer <a href="Michael%20Palin">Michael Palin</a>.

Kneale never saw himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often critical of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), for which he had once turned down an offer to write. "It sounded a terrible idea and I still think it was," he commented in 1986. "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has "<a href="Crossroads%20%28soap%20opera%29">Crossroads</a>" and that's a stinker". He also criticised "<a href="Blake%27s%207">Blake's 7</a>", which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called "<a href="Blake%27s%207">Blake's 7</a>" which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" and "<a href="Doomwatch">Doomwatch</a>": "I was approached to write "Doomwatch". That didn't seem to be much good either." "Doctor Who" was heavily influenced by Kneale's "Quatermass" serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from "Quatermass".

In a January 2015, BBC Radio 2 gave an interview with Hammer Films CEO Simon Oaks with news of developing a new Quatermass series for television.

In the early 1950s Kneale met fellow BBC screenwriter <a href="Judith%20Kerr">Judith Kerr</a>, a Jewish <a href="refugee">refugee</a>, in the BBC canteen. They married on 8 May 1954 and had two children; <a href="Matthew%20Kneale">Matthew</a>, who later became a successful novelist, and Tacy, an actress and later a special effects designer who worked on the popular "<a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a>" series of films. 

Kerr became a successful children's writer, with the "<a href="Mog%20%28Judith%20Kerr%29">Mog</a>" series of books and "<a href="When%20Hitler%20Stole%20Pink%20Rabbit">When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit</a>", which was based on her own experiences of fleeing <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> Germany in her youth. Kneale worked with Kerr on an adaptation of "When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit" in the 1970s, but the eventual makers of the film version disregarded their script. Similarly, in 1995 Kneale scripted a four-part adaptation of one of Kerr's sequels to the book, "A Small Person Far Away", but this also went unproduced.

Kneale was proud of his son's success as a writer. When his novel "<a href="English%20Passengers">English Passengers</a>" won the <a href="Costa%20Book%20Awards">Whitbread Book of the Year</a> award in 2001, his father commented that: "Matthew's much better than I am. I just wrote screenplays."

Kneale's younger brother is the renowned <a href="artist">artist</a> and <a href="sculpture">sculptor</a> <a href="Bryan%20Kneale">Bryan Kneale</a>, who was Master and then Professor of Sculpture at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> from 1982 to 1990. Bryan Kneale painted the covers for the "Quatermass" script books released by <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a> in 1959 and 1960. He was also responsible for a painting of a <a href="lobster">lobster</a> from which <a href="special%20effect">special effect</a>s designers Bernard Wilkie and Jack Kine drew their inspiration for the <a href="Martian">Martian</a> creatures they constructed for the original television version of "Quatermass and the Pit".

Quatermass and the Pit

Quatermass and the Pit is a <a href="Television%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British television</a> <a href="Science%20fiction%20on%20television">science-fiction</a> <a href="Serial%20%28radio%20and%20television%29">serial</a> transmitted live by <a href="BBC%20One">BBC Television</a> in December 1958 and January 1959. It was the third and last of the BBC's "Quatermass" serials, although the chief character, <a href="Bernard%20Quatermass">Professor Bernard Quatermass</a>, reappeared in a 1979 <a href="ITV%20Network">ITV</a> production called "<a href="Quatermass%20%28TV%20serial%29">Quatermass</a>". Like its predecessors, "Quatermass and the Pit" was written by <a href="Nigel%20Kneale">Nigel Kneale</a>.

The serial continues the loose chronology of the Quatermass adventures. Workmen excavating a site in <a href="Knightsbridge">Knightsbridge</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, discover a strange skull and what at first appears to be an unexploded bomb. Quatermass and his newly appointed military superior at the British Experimental Rocket Group, Colonel Breen, become involved in the investigation when it becomes apparent that the object is an <a href="Extraterrestrials%20in%20fiction">alien spacecraft</a>. The ship and its contents have a powerful and malign influence over many of those who come in contact with it, including Quatermass. It becomes obvious to him that the aliens, probably from Mars, had been abducting pre-humans and modifying them to give them <a href="Psychic%23Science%20fiction">psychic</a> abilities much like their own before returning them to Earth, a genetic legacy responsible for much of the war and strife in the world.

The serial has been cited as having influenced <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> and the <a href="film%20director">film director</a> <a href="John%20Carpenter">John Carpenter</a>. It featured in the <a href="100%20Greatest%20British%20Television%20Programmes">100 Greatest British Television Programmes</a> compiled by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> in 2000, which described it as "completely gripping".

"<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Experiment">The Quatermass Experiment</a>" (1953) and "<a href="Quatermass%20II">Quatermass II</a>" (1955), both written by Nigel Kneale, had been critical and popular successes for the BBC, and in early 1957 the corporation decided to commission a third serial. Kneale had left the BBC shortly before, but was hired to write the new scripts on a <a href="freelance">freelance</a> basis.

The <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> had been in transition since the 1920s, and the pace accelerated in the wake of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. More and more member states demanded independence, and a series of crises erupted during the 1950s, including the 1952 <a href="Mau%20Mau%20Uprising">Mau Mau Uprising</a> in <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> and the <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a> of 1956. During the same period <a href="Modern%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">immigration into Britain</a> from the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> and the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> was on the increase, causing some resentment among elements of the British. At the time Kneale was working on his scripts <a href="Black%20British">black communities</a> in Nottingham and London <a href="Racism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">came under attack</a> from mobs of <a href="White%20British">white Britons</a>; Kneale became keen to develop the serial as an allegory for the emerging racial tensions that culminated in the <a href="Notting%20Hill%20race%20riots">Notting Hill race riots</a> of August and September 1958.

Workmen discover a pre-human skull while building in the fictional Hobbs Lane (formerly Hob's Lane, Hob being an antiquated name for the <a href="Devil">Devil</a>) in <a href="Knightsbridge">Knightsbridge</a>, London. Dr Matthew Roney, a <a href="paleontology">paleontologist</a>, examines the remains and reconstructs a <a href="dwarf%20%28mythology%29">dwarf</a>-like <a href="humanoid">humanoid</a> with a large brain volume, which he believes to be a primitive man. As further excavation is undertaken, something that looks like a missile is unearthed; further work by Roney's group is halted because the military believe it to be an unexploded Second World War bomb.

Roney calls in his friend Professor <a href="Bernard%20Quatermass">Bernard Quatermass</a> of the British Rocket Group to prevent the military from disturbing what he believes to be an archaeological find. Quatermass and Colonel Breen, recently appointed to lead the Rocket Group over Quatermass's objections, become intrigued by the site. As more of the artefact is uncovered additional <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s are found, which Roney dates to five million years, suggesting that the object is at least that old. The interior is empty, and a symbol of five intersecting circles, which Roney identifies as the occult <a href="pentacle">pentacle</a>, is etched on a wall that appears to conceal an inner chamber.

The shell of the object is so hard that even a <a href="Borazon">boron nitride</a> drill makes no impression, and when the attempt is made, vibrations cause severe distress in people around the object. Quatermass interviews local residents and discovers <a href="ghost">ghost</a>s and <a href="poltergeist">poltergeist</a>s have been common in the area for decades. An hysterical soldier is carried out of the object, claiming to have seen a dwarf-like apparition walk through the wall of the artefact, a description that matches a 1927 newspaper account of a ghost.

Following the drilling, a hole opens up in the object's interior wall. Inside, Quatermass and the others find the remains of insect-like <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">aliens</a> resembling giant three-legged <a href="locust">locust</a>s, with stubby antennae on their heads giving the impression of horns. As Quatermass and Roney examine the remains, they theorise the aliens may have come from a planet habitable five million years ago – <a href="Mars">Mars</a>.

While clearing his equipment from the craft the drill operator triggers more poltergeist activity, and runs through the streets in a panic until he finds sanctuary in a church. Quatermass and Roney find him there, and he describes visions of the insect aliens killing each other. As Quatermass investigates the history of the area, he finds accounts dating back to <a href="medieval">medieval</a> times about devils and ghosts, all centred on incidents where the ground was disturbed. He suspects a psychic projection of these beings has remained on the alien ship and is being seen by those who come into contact with it.

Quatermass decides to use Roney's optic-encephalogram, a device that records impressions from the optical centres of the brain, and see the visions for himself. Roney's assistant, Barbara Judd, is most sensitive; placing the device on her, they record a violent purge of the Martian hive to root out unwanted mutations. Quatermass concludes that in its most primitive phase mankind was visited by this race of Martians. Some apes and primitive pre-humans were taken away and genetically altered to give them abilities such as <a href="telepathy">telepathy</a>, <a href="telekinesis">telekinesis</a> and other psychic powers. They were then returned to Earth, and the buried artefact is one of the ships that had crashed at the end of its journey. With their home world dying, the aliens had tried to change humanity's ancestors to have minds and abilities similar to their own, but with a bodily form adapted to life on Earth.

But the aliens became extinct before completing their work. As the human race bred and evolved a percentage retained their psychic abilities that surfaced only sporadically. For centuries the buried ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around, and the ghost sightings were traces of a <a href="racial%20memory">racial memory</a>. The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. They believe that the craft is a <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> propaganda weapon and the alien bodies fakes designed to create exactly the impressions that Quatermass has succumbed to, and decide to hold a media event to stem the rumours that are already spreading.

Quatermass warns that if implanted psychic powers survive in the human race, there could also still be an ingrained compulsion to enact the "<a href="Wild%20Hunt">Wild Hunt</a>" of a race purge, but the media event goes ahead regardless. The power cables that string into the craft fully activate it for the first time, and glowing and humming like a living thing it starts to draw upon this energy source and awaken the ancient racial programming. Those Londoners in whom the alien admixture remains strong fall under the ship's influence; they merge into a <a href="group%20mind%20%28science%20fiction%29">group mind</a> and begin a telekinetic <a href="mass%20murder">mass murder</a> of those without the alien <a href="genetics">genes</a>, an <a href="ethnic%20cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a> of those the alien race mind considers to be impure and weak.

Breen stands transfixed and is eventually consumed by the energies from the craft as it slowly melts away and an image of a Martian "devil" floats in the sky above London. Fires and riots erupt, and Quatermass succumbs to the <a href="Folie%20%C3%A0%20deux">mass psychosis</a> and attempts to kill Roney, who lacks the alien gene and is immune to alien influence. Roney manages to shake Quatermass out of his trance, and remembering the legends of demons and their aversion to iron and water, proposes that a sufficient mass of iron connected to wet earth may be sufficient to short-circuit the apparition. Quatermass acquires a length of iron chain and tries to reach the "devil" but succumbs to its psychic pressure. Roney manages to walk up to the apparition and hurls the chain at it, resulting in him and the spacecraft being reduced to ashes.

At the conclusion of the final episode Quatermass gives a television broadcast, at the end of which he delivers a warning directly to camera: "If we cannot control the inheritance within us, this will be their [the Martians'] second dead planet."
For the third time in as many serials the title role was played by a different actor, this time by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Morell">André Morell</a>; the part had initially been offered to <a href="Alec%20Clunes">Alec Clunes</a>, but he declined it. Morell had a reputation for playing authority figures, such as Colonel Green in "<a href="The%20Bridge%20on%20the%20River%20Kwai">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a>" (1957), and had previously worked with Kneale and Cartier when he appeared as <a href="O%27Brien%20%281984%29">O'Brien</a> in their BBC television adaptation of "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four%20%28UK%20TV%20programme%29">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>" (1954). He had been the first actor offered the part of Quatermass, for the original serial "<a href="The%20Quatermass%20Experiment">The Quatermass Experiment</a>" in 1953; he turned the part down. Morell's portrayal of Quatermass has been described as the definitive interpretation of the character.

Colonel Breen was played by <a href="Anthony%20Bushell">Anthony Bushell</a>, who was known for various similar military roles – including another bomb disposal officer in "<a href="The%20Small%20Back%20Room">The Small Back Room</a>" (1949) – and preferred to be addressed as "Major Bushell", the rank he held during the Second World War. Roney was played by Canadian actor <a href="Cec%20Linder">Cec Linder</a>, <a href="John%20Stratton%20%28actor%29">John Stratton</a> played Captain Potter, and <a href="Christine%20Finn">Christine Finn</a> played the other main character, Barbara Judd. She went on to provide the voices for various characters in the popular 1960s children's television series "<a href="Thunderbirds%20%28TV%20series%29">Thunderbirds</a>".

For the first time, Kneale used a character from a previous serial other than Quatermass himself, the journalist James Fullalove from "The Quatermass Experiment". The production team had hoped that <a href="Paul%20Whitsun-Jones">Paul Whitsun-Jones</a> would be able to reprise the part; he was unavailable and <a href="Brian%20Worth%20%28actor%29">Brian Worth</a> was cast instead. <a href="Michael%20Ripper">Michael Ripper</a> appeared as an army sergeant; he had been in <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer Film Productions</a>' adaptation of the second "Quatermass" serial, "<a href="Quatermass%202">Quatermass 2</a>", the previous year. The drama also featured future "<a href="Dad%27s%20Army">Dad's Army</a>" actress <a href="Nan%20Braunton">Nan Braunton</a> as Miss Dobson.

The director assigned was <a href="Rudolph%20Cartier">Rudolph Cartier</a>, with whom Kneale had a good working relationship; the two had collaborated on the previous "Quatermass" serials, as well as the literary adaptations "<a href="Wuthering%20Heights">Wuthering Heights</a>" (1953) and "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four%20%28UK%20TV%20programme%29">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>" (1954). The budget of £17,500 allocated for "Quatermass and the Pit" was larger than that of the previous "Quatermass" productions.
<a href="Pre-production">Pre-production</a> began in September 1958, while Cartier was still working on "<a href="A%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Cities">A Tale of Two Cities</a>" and "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>" for the BBC. As the two previous "Quatermass" serials had been scheduled in half-hour slots but, performed <a href="live%20television">live</a>, had overrun, Cartier requested 35-minute slots for the six episodes of "Quatermass and the Pit". This was agreed in November 1958, just before the start of production on 24 November. The six episodes – "The Halfmen", "The Ghosts", "Imps and Demons", "The Enchanted", "The Wild Hunt" and "Hob"  – were broadcast on Monday nights at 8 pm from 22 December 1958 to 26 January 1959.

Each episode was predominantly live from Studio 1 of the BBC's <a href="Riverside%20Studios">Riverside Studios</a> in <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a>, London. The episodes were rehearsed from Tuesday to Saturday, usually at the Mary Wood Settlement in <a href="Tavistock%20Place">Tavistock Place</a>, London, with camera rehearsals in the morning and afternoon of transmission. Not every scene was live; a significant amount of material was on <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm film</a> and inserted during the performance. Most filming involved scenes set <a href="Filming%20location">on location</a> or those too technically complex or expansive to achieve live. The latter were shot at <a href="Ealing%20Studios">Ealing Studios</a>, acquired by the BBC in 1955, where Cartier worked with the <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a> <a href="A.%20A.%20Englander">A. A. Englander</a>. Pre-filming was also used to show the passage of time in the second episode; the archaeological dig at Ealing was shown to have dug deeper into the ground than the equivalent set at Riverside, enabling a sense of time having elapsed that would not have been possible in an all-live production.

Made just before <a href="Quadruplex%20videotape">videotape</a> became general at the BBC, all six episodes of "Quatermass and the Pit" were preserved for a possible <a href="rerun">repeat</a> by being <a href="Telerecording">telerecorded</a> on 35 mm film. This was achieved with a specially-synchronised <a href="Movie%20camera">film camera</a> capturing the output of a video <a href="video%20monitor">monitor</a>; the process had been refined throughout the 1950s and recordings of "Quatermass and the Pit" are of high technical quality. The serial was repeated in edited form as two 90-minute episodes, entitled "5 Million Years Old" and "Hob", on 26 December 1959 and 2 January 1960. The third episode, "Imps and Demons", was re-shown on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> on 7 November 1986 as part of the "TV50" season, celebrating 50 years of BBC television.

"Quatermass and the Pit" was the last original production on which Kneale collaborated with Rudolph Cartier.

Special effects were handled by the BBC Visual Effects Department, formed by Bernard Wilkie and Jack Kine in 1954. Kine or Wilkie oversaw effects on a production; due to the number of effects, both worked on "Quatermass and the Pit". The team pre-filmed most of their effects for use during the live broadcasts. They also oversaw <a href="practical%20effect">practical effect</a>s for the Ealing filming and Riverside transmission, and constructed the bodies of the Martian creatures.

The music was credited to <a href="Trevor%20Duncan">Trevor Duncan</a>, a <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a> used by BBC radio producer Leonard Trebilco, whose music was obtained from stock discs. "Quatermass and the Pit" also used <a href="sound%20effect">sound effect</a>s and <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a> to create a disturbing atmosphere. These tracks were created for the serial by the <a href="BBC%20Radiophonic%20Workshop">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a>, overseen by <a href="Desmond%20Briscoe">Desmond Briscoe</a>; "Quatermass and the Pit" was one of the productions for which Briscoe and the workshop became most renowned. It was the first time electronic music had been used in a science-fiction television production.

"Quatermass and the Pit" was watched by an average audience of 9.6 million viewers, peaking at 11 million for the final episode. "The Times" television reviewer praised the opening episode the day after its transmission. Pointing out that "Professor Bernard Quatermass ... like all science fiction heroes, has to keep running hard if he is not to be overtaken by the world of fact", the anonymous reviewer went on to state how much he had enjoyed the episode as "an excellent example of Mr. Kneale's ability to hold an audience with promises alone; smooth, leisurely, and without any sensational incident".

Kneale went on to use the Martian "Wild Hunt" as an allegory for the recent <a href="1958%20Notting%20Hill%20race%20riots">Notting Hill race riots</a>, but some <a href="Black%20British">Black British</a> leaders were upset by the depiction of racial tensions in the first episode. "Leaders of coloured minorities here to-day criticized the BBC for allowing a report that 'race riots are continuing in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>,' to be included in a fictional news bulletin during the first instalment of the new Quatermass television play last night", reported "The Times" Birmingham correspondent.

These themes and subtexts were highlighted by the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s review of the serial when it was included in their TV 100 list in 2000, in 75th position – 20th out of the dramas featured: "In a story which mined mythology and folklore ... under the guise of genre it tackled serious themes of man's hostile nature and the military's perversion of science for its own ends." The theme of military takeover of peaceful scientific research was also considered favourably by <a href="Patrick%20Stoddart">Patrick Stoddart</a>, writing for "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times%20%28UK%29">The Sunday Times</a>" in 1988: "Last week I watched a BBC drama in which a scientist fought against smirking government ministers and power-crazed army officers to stop his peaceful rocket research group being turned into a <a href="Strategic%20Defense%20Initiative">Star Wars</a> vehicle to put missiles on the moon. They won."

In a 2006 "<a href="The%20Guardian">Guardian</a>" article <a href="Mark%20Gatiss">Mark Gatiss</a> wrote "What sci-fi piece of the past 50 years doesn't owe Kneale a huge debt? ... The 'ancient invasion' of "Quatermass and the Pit" cast a huge shadow ... its brilliant blending of superstition, witchcraft and ghosts into the story of a five-million-year-old Martian invasion is copper-bottomed genius." Gatiss was a scriptwriter for "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>", a programme that had been particularly strongly influenced by the "Quatermass" serials throughout its history. <a href="Derrick%20Sherwin">Derrick Sherwin</a>, the <a href="television%20producer">producer</a> of "Doctor Who" in 1969, acknowledged "Quatermass and the Pit"s influence on the programme's move towards more realism and away from "wobbly jellies in outer space". The 1971 and 1977 "Doctor Who" serials "<a href="The%20D%C3%A6mons">The Dæmons</a>" and "<a href="Image%20of%20the%20Fendahl">Image of the Fendahl</a>" share many elements with "Quatermass and the Pit": the unearthing of an extraterrestrial spaceship, an alien race that has interfered with human evolution and is the basis for legends of devils, demons and witchcraft, and an alien influence over human evolution.

The writer and critic <a href="Kim%20Newman">Kim Newman</a>, speaking about Kneale's career in a 2003 <a href="television%20documentary">television documentary</a>, cited "Quatermass and the Pit" as perfecting "the notion of the science-fictional detective story". Newman also discussed the programme as an influence on the <a href="horror%20fiction">horror fiction</a> writer <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>, claiming that King had "more or less rewritten "Quatermass and the Pit" in "<a href="The%20Tommyknockers">The Tommyknockers</a>"".

After "Quatermass and the Pit" Kneale felt that it was time to rest the character. By the early 1970s he had decided there were new avenues to explore, and the BBC planned a fourth "Quatermass" serial in 1972. The BBC did not proceed with the project, and Kneale's scripts were produced in 1979 as a four-part serial for <a href="Thames%20Television">Thames Television</a> titled "<a href="Quatermass%20%28TV%20serial%29">Quatermass</a>".

As with the previous two Quatermass serials, the rights to adapt "Quatermass and the Pit" for the cinema were purchased by Hammer Film Productions. Their <a href="Quatermass%20and%20the%20Pit%20%28film%29">adaptation</a> was released with the same title as the original in 1967, directed by <a href="Roy%20Ward%20Baker">Roy Ward Baker</a> and scripted by Kneale. Scottish actor <a href="Andrew%20Keir">Andrew Keir</a> starred as Quatermass, the role for which he was best remembered and regarded particularly highly in comparison to the previous film Quatermass, <a href="Brian%20Donlevy">Brian Donlevy</a>. The film, made in <a href="color%20motion%20picture%20film">colour</a>, is regarded by many commentators as a classic of the genre for the way it blends science fiction with the supernatural. In the United States the film was retitled "Five Million Years to Earth".

A script book of "Quatermass and the Pit" was released by <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a> in April 1960, with a cover by Kneale's artist brother <a href="Bryan%20Kneale">Bryan Kneale</a>. In 1979 this was re-published by <a href="Arrow%20Books">Arrow Books</a> to coincide with the transmission of the fourth and final Quatermass serial on ITV; this edition featured a new introduction by Kneale. The theatrical company Creation Productions staged a live adaptation of "Quatermass and the Pit" in a quarry near <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> in August 1997.

The BBC made "Quatermass and the Pit" available to buy on <a href="VHS">VHS</a> videotape in the mid-80s, edited into a two-part compilation format. This was a new compilation made from the episodic film recordings, which had optical sound and telecined film inserts. This was re-released on VHS by Paradox Films, Total Home Entertainment and <a href="Revelation%20Films">Revelation Films</a> in 1995, and subsequently on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> by Revelation Films in 2000. The full, unedited, episodic version of the serial was released on DVD by <a href="BBC%20Worldwide">BBC Worldwide</a> in 2005, as part of "The Quatermass Collection" <a href="box%20set">box set</a>. Also included were the surviving two episodes of "The Quatermass Experiment", all of "Quatermass II" and various <a href="DVD-Video%23Extra%20features">extra features</a>.

For the box set release, "Quatermass and the Pit" was extensively restored. A process called <a href="VidFIRE">VidFIRE</a> was applied to all of the scenes originally broadcast live, restoring the fluid <a href="Video%23Interlacing">interlaced video</a> look they would have had on transmission, but which was lost during the telerecording process. For the pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original 35 mm film inserts still existed, as they had been <a href="Film%20splicer">spliced</a> into the 1959–60 compilation repeat version in place of the lower-quality telerecorded versions of the same sequences. As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences were able to be <a href="Remaster">digitally remastered</a> and inserted into the newly restored episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, and in a few cases where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the optical versions.

A 1959 episode of the <a href="BBC%20radio">BBC radio</a> comedy series "<a href="The%20Goon%20Show">The Goon Show</a>" parodied "Quatermass and the Pit". The episode "The Scarlet Capsule" was written by <a href="Spike%20Milligan">Spike Milligan</a>, and used the original BBC Radiophonic Workshop sound effects made for the television serial. The episode has been released on several LPs and CD compilations by <a href="EMI">EMI</a>, but owing to copyright restrictions the show's musical interludes were removed and the closing playout heavily abridged. A more complete version has been broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204%20Extra">BBC Radio 4 Extra</a> (formerly BBC7) and subsequently appeared on CD following reversion of rights.

The serial was also parodied by the BBC television comedy series "<a href="Hancock%27s%20Half%20Hour">Hancock's Half Hour</a>" in an episode entitled "The Horror Serial", transmitted the week following the final episode. In it, <a href="Tony%20Hancock">Tony Hancock</a> has just finished watching the final episode of "Quatermass and the Pit", and becomes convinced that there is a crashed Martian space ship buried at the end of his garden. (It is in fact an unexploded bomb, although Hancock claims that the warning "Achtung!" is really the Martian for <a href="Acton%2C%20London">Acton</a>.) This episode no longer exists in the BBC's archives, but a private collector's audio-only recording has been discovered, and released publicly on the "Hancock's Half Hour Collectibles Volume One" box set.

It was parodied a third time in a sketch from the final series of "<a href="The%20Two%20Ronnies">The Two Ronnies</a>" in 1986: the sketch featured a guest appearance by <a href="Joanna%20Lumley">Joanna Lumley</a>.

Belgium national football team

The Belgian national football team has officially represented <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> in <a href="association%20football">association football</a> since <a href="%C3%89vence%20Copp%C3%A9e%20Trophy">their maiden match</a> in 1904. The squad is under the global jurisdiction of <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> and is governed in Europe by <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>—both of which were co-founded by the Belgian team's supervising body, the <a href="Royal%20Belgian%20Football%20Association">Royal Belgian Football Association</a> (RBFA). Periods of regular Belgian representation at the highest international level, from 1920 to 1938, from 1982 to 2002 and again from 2014 onwards, have alternated with mostly unsuccessful qualification rounds. Most of Belgium's home matches are played at the <a href="King%20Baudouin%20Stadium">King Baudouin Stadium</a> in Brussels.

Belgium's national team have participated in three quadrennial major football competitions. It appeared in the end stages of thirteen <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a>s and five <a href="UEFA%20European%20Championship">UEFA European Championship</a>s, and featured at three Olympic football tournaments, including the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201920%20Summer%20Olympics">1920 Olympic tournament</a> which they won. Other notable performances are victories over four <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%23Results">reigning world champions</a>—West Germany, Brazil, Argentina and France—between 1954 and 2002. Belgium has long-standing football rivalries with its Dutch and French counterparts, having played both teams nearly every year from 1905 to 1967. The squad has been known as the Red Devils since 1906; its fan club is named "1895".

During the national player career of forward <a href="Paul%20Van%20Himst">Paul Van Himst</a>, the most-praised Belgian footballer of the 20th century, Belgium took third place at <a href="Euro%201972">Euro 1972</a>. After that, they experienced two <a href="Golden%20generation">golden age</a>s with many gifted players. In the first period, which lasted from the 1980s to the early 1990s, the team finished as runners-up at <a href="Euro%201980">Euro 1980</a> and fourth in the <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986 World Cup</a>. In the second, under guidance of <a href="Marc%20Wilmots">Marc Wilmots</a> and later <a href="Roberto%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Roberto Martínez</a> in the 2010s, Belgium topped the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Rankings">FIFA World Rankings</a> for the first time in November 2015 and finished third at the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018 World Cup</a>. Belgium currently participates in League A of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20UEFA%20Nations%20League">first UEFA Nations League edition</a>.

Belgium was one of the first mainland European countries to play association football. Its practice in Belgium began on 26 October 1863, after an Irish student walked into the Josephites College of <a href="Melle%2C%20Belgium">Melle</a> with a leather ball. Initially an elitist pastime, during the following decades association football supplanted <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a> as Belgium's most popular football sport. On 1 September 1895, ten clubs for football, athletics, cricket and cycling founded the Belgian sports board Union Belge des Sociétés de Sports Athlétiques (UBSSA); a year later UBSSA organised <a href="Belgian%20First%20Division%201895-96">the first annual league in Belgian football</a>.

On 11 October 1900, <a href="K.%20Beerschot%20V.A.C.">Beerschot AC</a> honorary president Jorge Díaz announced that <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> would host a series of challenge matches between Europe's best football teams. After some organisational problems, on 28 April 1901, Beerschot's pitch hosted its first tournament, in which a Belgian A-squad and a Dutch B-team contested the Coupe Vanden Abeele. Belgium won, and beat the Netherlands in all three follow-up matches; FIFA does not recognise these results because Belgium fielded some English players. On 1 May 1904, the Belgians played their first official match, against <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> at the <a href="Stade%20du%20Vivier%20d%27Oie">Stade du Vivier d'Oie</a> in Uccle; their draw left the Évence Coppée Trophy unclaimed. Twenty days later, the <a href="Football%20association">football board</a>s of both countries were among the seven FIFA founders. At that time, the Belgian squad was chosen by a committee drawn from the country's six or seven major clubs. In 1906, the national team players received the nickname Red Devils because of their red jerseys, and four years later, Scottish ex-footballer <a href="William%20Maxwell%20%28footballer%29">William Maxwell</a> replaced the UBSSA committee as their manager. From 1912, UBSSA governed football only and was renamed UBSFA. During the Great War, the national team only played <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team%20results%20%E2%80%93%20unofficial%20matches">unrecognised friendlies</a>, with matches in and against France.

At the <a href="1920%20Summer%20Olympics">1920 Summer Olympics</a>, in their first official Olympic appearance, the "Red Devils" won the gold medal on home soil after <a href="Football%20at%20the%201920%20Summer%20Olympics%23Gold%20medal%20match">a controversial final</a> in which their Czechoslovak opponents left the pitch. In the three 1920s Summer Olympics, they achieved fair results (four wins in seven matches), and played their first intercontinental match, against <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a>. However, over the following decade, Belgium lost all of their matches at the first three FIFA World Cup final tournaments. According to historian Richard Henshaw, "[t]he growth of [football] in Scandinavia, Central Europe, and South America left Belgium far behind". Although World War II hindered international football events in the 1940s, the Belgian team remained active with unofficial matches against squads of other <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">allied nations</a>.

Belgium qualified for only one of eight major tournaments during the 1950s and the 1960s: the <a href="1954%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1954 World Cup</a>. The day before the tournament began, the RBFA was among the three UEFA founders. Dutch journalists considered the draw of the 1954 Belgian team in their opener against <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> to be the most surprising result of that match day, even more than <a href="Switzerland%20national%20football%20team">Switzerland</a>'s victory over the Italian "football stars". However, Belgium were eliminated after a loss to <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> in the second (and last) group match. Two bright spots in these decades were wins against World Cup holders: <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a> in 1954, and <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a> in 1963. Between these, Belgium defeated Hungary's <a href="Golden%20Team">Golden Team</a> in 1956. The combination of failure in competitive matches, and success in exhibition matches, gave the Belgians the mock title of "world champion of the friendlies".

The team's performance improved during the early 1970s, under manager <a href="Raymond%20Goethals">Raymond Goethals</a>. Fully dressed in white, as the White Devils, Belgium had their first victories at World and European Championships at the <a href="1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1970 World Cup</a> and Euro 1972. En route to that Euro appearance, their first, they eliminated <a href="List%20of%20UEFA%20European%20Championship%20records%23General%20statistics%20by%20tournament">reigning European champions</a> Italy by winning the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201972%20quarter-finals">two-legged quarter-final</a> on <a href="Glossary%20of%20association%20football%20terms%23A">aggregate</a>. At the end stage, they finished third by winning the consolation match against Hungary. In 1973, the denial of a match-winning goal in their last <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">1974 FIFA World Cup qualification</a> match for UEFA Group 3 cost Belgium their appearance at the finals, causing Belgium to become the only nation ever to miss a World Cup final round despite not allowing a goal during the qualifiers. The next two attempts to reach a major finals were also fruitless.

Beginning with a second-place finish at Euro 1980, the 1980s and the early 1990s are generally considered as Belgium's first golden age. Coached by <a href="Guy%20Thys">Guy Thys</a>, they achieved their spot in <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201980%20Final">the 1980 final</a> with an unbeaten record in the group phase; in the final, they narrowly lost the title to West Germany with the score 1–2. Starting with the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 World Cup</a>, and ending with the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 World Cup</a>, the national team qualified for six consecutive World Cup end stages and mostly progressed to the second round. During this period, managers Guy Thys, Paul Van Himst and <a href="Robert%20Waseige">Robert Waseige</a> each guided a Belgian selection past the first round. In addition to receiving individual <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%20awards">FIFA recognitions</a>, the team reached the semi-finals of the <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986 World Cup</a>. After reaching the Euro 1980 final, they were unsuccessful at subsequent European Championships, with early exits from their appearances <a href="Euro%201984">in 1984</a> and <a href="Euro%202000">in 2000</a>. During the late 1990s, they played three friendly tournaments in Morocco, Cyprus and Japan, sharing the <a href="Kirin%20Cup%231999%20Kirin%20Cup">1999 Kirin Cup</a> with Peru in the latter. The greatest talents of the Belgian team during this golden age were retired from international football by 2000. During the World Cup in 2002, Belgium defeated Russia and tied with co-hosts Japan and Tunisia to reach the round of 16.

After the 2002 World Cup, the team weakened with the loss of more veterans and coach Waseige. They missed out five successive major finals from <a href="Euro%202004">Euro 2004</a> until <a href="Euro%202012">Euro 2012</a>, and went through an equal number of head coaches. A 2005 win over reigning European champions <a href="Greece%20national%20football%20team">Greece</a> meant nothing but a small comfort. In between, a promising new generation was maturing at the <a href="2007%20UEFA%20European%20Under-21%20Championship">2007 European U-21 Championship</a>; <a href="Belgium%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Belgium's squad</a> qualified for the following year's <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">Summer Olympics in Beijing</a>, where the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20team%20squads%23Belgium">Young Red Devils squad</a> finished fourth. Seventeen of them appeared in the senior national team, albeit without making an immediate impact. Belgium finished in second (and last) place at the <a href="Kirin%20Cup%232009%20Kirin%20Cup">Kirin Cup in May 2009</a>, and lost against the 125th FIFA-ranked <a href="Armenia%20national%20football%20team">Armenian team</a> in September 2009. After <a href="Georges%20Leekens">Georges Leekens</a>' second stint as national manager, his assistant Marc Wilmots became the caretaker in May 2012.

After two matches as interim coach, Wilmots agreed to replace Leekens as manager. Following his appointment, the team's results improved, such that some foreign media regarded it as another Belgian golden generation. The young Belgian squad qualified as unbeaten <a href="2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%E2%80%93%20UEFA%20Group%20A">group winners</a> for the <a href="2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2014 World Cup</a> finals, and earned Belgium's second-ever <a href="2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%23Tournament%20team%20rankings">place in a World Cup quarter-finals</a> with a four-match winning streak. Belgium qualified for <a href="Euro%202016">Euro 2016</a> with a match to spare in October 2015, and took the top spot in the FIFA World Rankings for the first time in November 2015, to stay first for five months. In the following year, Belgium could not confirm their role as outsider at the European Championship with a quarter-final elimination by the 26th FIFA-ranked <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Welsh team</a>. This prompted the RBFA to dismiss Wilmots. In the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">2018 World Cup qualifying</a> allocation, they were seeded first in their group, and made the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">final tournament</a> under Spanish manager <a href="Roberto%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Roberto Martínez</a>, becoming the first European team besides hosts <a href="Russia%20national%20football%20team">Russia</a> to do so. The team reached an all-time high third place in the <a href="World%20Football%20Elo%20Ratings">World Football Elo Ratings</a> after their win in the round of 16. Belgium was eliminated in the semi-finals by eventual champions France, but won the third place play-off against <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>.

In home matches, the team's <a href="Glossary%20of%20association%20football%20terms%23O">outfield player</a>s traditionally wear the colours of the <a href="Flag%20of%20Belgium">Belgian flag</a>: black, yellow and red. Red dominates the strip and is often the sole jersey colour. The <a href="away%20colours">away colours</a> are usually white, black or both; in 2014, the squad introduced a third, yellow kit. Their shirts are often trimmed with "tricolores" at the margins. Since 1981, the RBFA emblem has been the national team's badge; the previous badge was a yellow lion on a black shield, similar to the escutcheon of the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Belgium">national coat of arms</a>.

For their first unofficial match in 1901, the Belgian team wore white jerseys with tricoloured bands on the upper arms. Around their third unofficial match in 1902, the choice was made for a "shirt with national colours ... [that would indicate,] with a stripe, the number of times every player has participated in an encounter". Since 1904, Belgium's classic all-red jersey design has been altered twice. In 1904–05, the squad briefly wore satin shirts with three horizontal bands in red, yellow and black; according to sports journalist <a href="Victor%20Boin">Victor Boin</a>, the shirts set "the ugliness record". During the 1970s, manager Raymond Goethals chose an all-white combination to improve the team's visibility during evening matches.

In 1905, a Dutch journalist wrote a post-match report that described three Belgian footballers to "work as devils". A year later, inspired by Belgium's red-coloured jerseys and three successive victories, <a href="L%C3%A9opold%20FC">Léopold FC</a> manager Pierre Walckiers nicknamed the Belgian players "Red Devils". Because of the white home shirts Belgium wore in the 1970s, they were temporarily known as the White Devils.

Six clothing manufacturers have supplied the official team strip. Since 2014, it has been produced by <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>, who was also the supplier from 1974 to 1980, and from 1982 to 1991. Former kit manufacturers are <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a> (early 1970s), <a href="Admiral%20Sportswear">Admiral</a> (1981–1982), <a href="Diadora">Diadora</a> (1992–1999), <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> (1999–2010) and Burrda (2010–2014).

Numerous former and current <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team%20home%20stadium%23List%20of%20home%20stadiums">venues in 11 urban areas</a> have hosted Belgium's home matches. Most of these matches have been played in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> at the <a href="Heysel%20Plateau">Heysel Plateau</a>, on the site of the present-day <a href="King%20Baudouin%20Stadium">King Baudouin Stadium</a>—a multipurpose facility with a seating capacity of 50,122. Its field also hosts the team's final trainings before domestic matches. Since 2007, most physical preparation takes place at the National Football Centre in <a href="Tubize">Tubize</a>, or at <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a>'s training ground in the <a href="Anderlecht">Neerpede</a> quarter. Apart from Belgian home friendlies, at the international level Belgium's national stadium has also hosted six European Championship matches.

In 1930, for the country's centennial, the venue was inaugurated as the Jubilee Stadium with an unofficial match between Belgium and the Netherlands. At that time, the stadium had a capacity of 75,000. In 1946, it was renamed Heysel Stadium after its city quarter. This new name became associated with the tragedy preceding the <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20final">1985 European Cup final</a> between Juventus and Liverpool; <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">39 spectators died</a> after riots in the then antiquated building. Three years after the disaster, plans were unveiled for a renovation; in 1995, after two years of work, the modernised stadium was named after the late <a href="Baudouin%20of%20Belgium">King Baudouin</a>. In May 2013, the Brussels-Capital Region announced that the King Baudouin Stadium would be replaced by <a href="Eurostadium">Eurostadium</a>, elsewhere on the Heysel Plateau; in 2018, however, the plans for the new stadium were cancelled definitively.

The first live coverage of a Belgian sporting event occurred on 3 May 1931, when journalist <a href="Gust%20De%20Muynck">Gust De Muynck</a> commentated on the football match between Belgium and the Netherlands on radio. Later, football broadcasts were also televised. As 60 per cent of Belgians speak Dutch and 40 per cent French, commentaries for the national team matches are provided in both languages. The matches are not broadcast in German—Belgium's third official language. During Belgium's tournament appearances in the 1980s and the early 1990s, <a href="Rik%20De%20Saedeleer">Rik De Saedeleer</a> crowned himself the nation's most famous football commentator with his emotional and humorous reports.

Initially the matches were transmitted mainly on public television channels: the former <a href="BRTN">BRTN</a> in Dutch, and the <a href="RTBF">RTBF</a> in French. Since 1994, commercial channels such as <a href="vtm">vtm</a> and its sister channel <a href="Kanaal%202">Kanaal 2</a>, and <a href="VIER">VIER</a> in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, have purchased broadcasting rights. As of May 2018, the Euro 2016 <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202016%20knockout%20phase%23Hungary%20vs%20Belgium">round-of-16 match against Hungary</a> was the most-watched programme in Belgian television history, with an audience of over four million viewers out of 11.3 million Belgian citizens.

In April 2014, the <a href="Vlaamse%20Radio-%20en%20Televisieomroeporganisatie">VRT</a> started transmitting a nine-piece, behind-the-scenes documentary about the national team filmed during the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, titled "Iedereen Duivel" ("Everybody Devil"). Cable broadband provider <a href="Telenet%20%28Belgium%29">Telenet</a> broadcast an eight-part documentary about individual players titled "Rode Helden" ("Red Heroes").

2 weeks before <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018 FIFA World Cup</a>, all international fixtures featuring Belgium are currently broadcast by <a href="VTM%20%28TV%20channel%29">VTM</a> (in Dutch), <a href="RTBF">RTBF</a> and <a href="RTL%20Group">RTL Group</a> (both in French) until 2022.

Multiple events were organised for the fans during the squad's peak popularity in the 2010s. During the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, a string of interactive events called the "Devil Challenges" were organised. The premise was that small groups of international players would do a favour in return for each of the five comprehensive chores their supporters completed ("colour Belgium red", "gather 500,000 decibels", etc.), all of which were accomplished. In June 2013, the Belgian national team's first ever Fan Day attracted over 20,000 supporters; a second was held after the 2014 World Cup. On the days of Belgium's 2014 World Cup group matches, large dance events titled "Dance with the Devils" took place in three Belgian cities. This type of happening was repeated during Belgium's Euro 2016 group matches.

Occasionally, the Belgian team directly supported charity. Between 1914 and 1941 they played at minimum five unofficial matches of which the returns were for charitable purposes: two against France, and three against the Netherlands. In mid-1986, when the Belgian delegation reached the Mexico World Cup semi-finals, the squad started a project titled Casa Hogar, an idea of delegation leader <a href="Michel%20D%27Hooghe">Michel D'Hooghe</a>. Casa Hogar is a home for street children in the Mexican industrial city of <a href="Toluca">Toluca</a>, to which the footballers donated part of their tournament bonuses. In August 2013, the national team supported four social projects through the charity fund Football+ Foundation, by playing an A-match with a plus sign on the shoulders of their jerseys and auctioning the shirts.

In the 21st century, several national team players acted up against discrimination. In 2002, the national squad held its first anti-<a href="Racism%20in%20association%20football">racism</a> campaign in which they posed with slogans. A home Euro 2012 qualifier was given the theme of respect for <a href="cultural%20diversity">diversity</a> in 2010; this UEFA-supported action was part of the European <a href="Football%20Against%20Racism%20in%20Europe">FARE</a> Action Week. Ex-Red Devil <a href="Dimitri%20Mbuyu">Dimitri Mbuyu</a>—the first black Belgium player (in 1987)—was engaged as godfather, and other foreign, current, and former footballers who played in the <a href="Belgian%20Pro%20League">Belgian top division</a> participated. In 2018, four national team players spoke up against <a href="Violence%20against%20LGBT%20people">homophobic violence</a>, in a video clip made by organisation <a href="Kick%20It%20Out%20%28organisation%29">Kick It Out</a>.

Since 2012, the team logo is a red trident (or three-pronged pitchfork), an item that is often associated with the devil. Apart from that, the national squad has also had four official <a href="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphous</a> mascots. The first was a lion in team kit named Diabolix, a reference to the central symbol in the Belgian coat of arms that appeared on the team jerseys from 1905 to 1980. In accordance with their epithet, the next mascots were a red super-devil and two fan-made modern devils; the most recent one, since 2018, was named "Red".

Fans of the Belgian national team display the country's tricolour national flag, usually with an emphasis on the red element. In 2012, local supporter clubs merged into one large Belgian federation named "1895" after the foundation year of the RBFA. One year later, 1895 had 24,000 members. The nationwide interest in the football squad has also been reflected by the occasional presence of <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Belgium">Belgian monarch</a>s at their matches since 1914. One of the greatest moments for the Belgian team and their <a href="12th%20man%20%28football%29">12th man</a> was in mid-1986 when the Belgian delegation at the Mexico World Cup received a warm "welcome home". When the World Cup semi-finalists appeared on the balcony of <a href="Brussels%20Town%20Hall">Brussels Town Hall</a>, the adjoining Grand Place square was filled with an ecstatic crowd that cheered as though their squad had won a major tournament.

The team's deterioration after the 2002 World Cup lead to their absence from the end stages of the next five major tournaments, and strained their popularity. Between 2004 and 2010, local journalists called the Belgian footballing nation "mortally ill". Of the fans that kept supporting their squad in bad times, Ludo Rollenberg was one of the most loyal. He attended the team's matches worldwide since 1990, missing only the 1999 Japanese <a href="Kirin%20Cup">Kirin Cup</a> and two other matches by 2006, and was the only supporter to attend their matches in Armenia in 2009.

Just before the kick-off of a 2014 World Cup home qualifier, Belgium's footballers saw a first <a href="tifo">tifo</a> banner, sized depicting a devil in the national colours. The presence of many Belgian players in top leagues abroad, such as the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, and promising results under Marc Wilmots, increased fans' enthusiasm and belief in a successful World Cup campaign. Because of this popularity peak, two Belgian monuments were decorated in national colours for the 2014 FIFA World Cup event; the <a href="Manneken%20Pis">Manneken Pis</a> statue received a child-sized version of the new Belgian uniform, and facets of the <a href="Atomium">Atomium</a>'s upper sphere were covered in black, yellow and red vinyl.

Belgium's main football rivals are its neighbours the Netherlands and France, with which it shares close cultural and political relations.

The matchup between the Belgian and <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Dutch team</a> is known as the Low Countries <a href="Glossary%20of%20association%20football%20terms%23D">derby</a>, they have played each other in 126 official matches. Belgium won the first four—unofficial—matches against the Netherlands, but lost their first FIFA-recognised contest. The two national teams played each other biannually between 1905 and 1964, except during the World Wars. They have met 18 times in major tournament campaigns, and have played at least <a href="Low%20Countries%20derby%23Belgium%20vs.%20Netherlands%20Cups">35 friendly cup matches</a>: in Belgium for the "Coupe Vanden Abeele", and in the Netherlands for the "Rotterdamsch Nieuwsblad-Beker". The overall balance favours the Netherlands, with 55 wins against 41 Belgian victories. The Low Countries' squads co-operated in fundraising initiatives between 1925 and 1941; they played five unofficial matches for charity, FIFA and the Belgian Olympic Committee.

The clash between the Belgian and French sides is nicknamed "le Match Sympathique" in French ("the Friendly Match"); they have contested 73 official matches . The first match between Belgium and France, the "Évence Coppée" Trophy played in 1904, was the first official match for both teams and the first official football match between independent countries on the European continent. Until 1967, the sides met almost annually. As of May 2018, France has played most often against Belgium in international football. Belgium have the better record, with 30 wins to France's 25. However, France has two World Cups and have defeated the Belgians in all three World Cup encounters.

Since 1904, the RBFA, 24 permanent managers and two caretaker managers have officially been in charge of the national team; this includes one national footballer selector. , a crew of over 20 RBFA employees guides the player group, including their Spanish manager Roberto Martínez, his assistants <a href="Graeme%20Jones">Graeme Jones</a> and <a href="Thierry%20Henry">Thierry Henry</a>, and goalkeeping coaches <a href="Erwin%20Lemmens">Erwin Lemmens</a> and <a href="I%C3%B1aki%20Bergara">Iñaki Bergara</a>. As of 6 July 2018, Martínez is statistically the best performing Belgium manager with an average of 2.46 points per match. Under Marc Wilmots, Belgium reached the top FIFA ranking spot in 2015, which earned him the title of Best Coach of the Year at the 2015 <a href="Globe%20Soccer%20Awards">Globe Soccer Awards</a>. Under Guy Thys, the squad achieved record results at World and European championships; <a href="World%20Soccer%20%28magazine%29">"World Soccer" magazine</a> accordingly proclaimed him Manager of the Year in 1986.

Rather than developing innovative team formations or styles of play, Belgium's managers applied conventional tactics. At the three 1930s World Cups, the Red Devils were aligned in a contemporary <a href="2%E2%80%933%E2%80%935">2–3–5 "pyramid"</a>. In 1954, <a href="Doug%20Livingstone">Doug Livingstone</a>'s squad played in a <a href="Formation%20%28association%20football%29%23WM">3–2–5 "WM" arrangement</a> during World Cup matches. Throughout most of their tournament matches in the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s, the team played in a <a href="formation%20%28association%20football%29%234%E2%80%934%E2%80%932">4–4–2 formation</a>. Since Raymond Goethals' stint in the 1970s, a key strength of the Belgian squad has been their systematic use of the <a href="offside%20trap">offside trap</a>, a defensive tactic that was already intensively applied in the 1960s by Anderlecht coach <a href="Pierre%20Sinibaldi">Pierre Sinibaldi</a>. According to football journalist Wim De Bock, "master tactician" Goethals represented the "conservative, defensive football of the Belgian national team"; he added that in the 1970s, the contrast between the Belgian playing style and the <a href="Total%20Football">Total Football</a> of their Dutch rivals "could not be bigger".

In an attempt to win a match at the 1998 World Cup, Georges Leekens chose a <a href="formation%20%28association%20football%29%234%E2%80%933%E2%80%933">4–3–3</a> arrangement for Belgium's second and third group matches. Robert Waseige, Belgium coach around 2000, said that "above all, [his] 4–4–2 system [was] holy", in the sense that he left good attackers on the bench to keep his favourite formation. Wilmots opted for the 4–3–3 line-up again, with the intention of showing dominant football against any country.

The following 28 players were called up for the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202020%20qualifying%20Group%20I">UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying</a> matches against <a href="Russia%20national%20football%20team">Russia</a> and <a href="Cyprus%20national%20football%20team">Cyprus</a> on 21 and 24 March 2019, respectively. On 18 March both <a href="Thomas%20Meunier">Thomas Meunier</a> and <a href="Mousa%20Demb%C3%A9l%C3%A9%20%28Belgian%20footballer%29">Mousa Dembélé</a> dropped out due to injury.
<br>

The following footballers were part of a national selection in the past 12 months, but are not part of the <a href="%23Current">current squad</a>.

Between 1904 and 1980, mainly attacking Belgium players were recognised as talented footballers. In the team's first decade, striker <a href="Robert%20De%20Veen">Robert De Veen</a> was very productive with 26 goals in 23 international appearances. Richard Henshaw described <a href="Alphonse%20Six">Alphonse Six</a> as "Belgium's greatest player in the prewar period ... [who] was often called the most skillful forward outside Great Britain". The key player of the victorious 1920 Olympic squad was <a href="Robert%20Copp%C3%A9e">Robert Coppée</a>, who scored a <a href="Hat-trick%23Association%20football">hat-trick</a> against Spain's <a href="Ricardo%20Zamora">Ricardo Zamora</a>, and the penalty in the final. Other outstanding Belgian strikers in the interwar period were former top scorer <a href="Bernard%20Voorhoof">Bernard Voorhoof</a> and "Belgium's football grandmaster" <a href="Raymond%20Braine">Raymond Braine</a>, considered "one of the greatest players of the era".

Gifted players in the 1940s and the 1950s included <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29">centre-back</a> <a href="Louis%20Carr%C3%A9">Louis Carré</a> and attackers <a href="Jef%20Mermans">Jef Mermans</a>, <a href="Pol%20Anoul">Pol Anoul</a> and <a href="Rik%20Coppens">Rik Coppens</a>; at the 1954 World Cup, Anoul shone with three goals, and newspaper "<a href="L%27%C3%89quipe">L'Équipe</a>" named Coppens the event's best centre forward. The 1960s and the early 1970s were the glory days of forward and four-time <a href="Belgian%20Golden%20Shoe">Belgian Golden Shoe</a> Paul Van Himst, later elected Belgian <a href="UEFA%20Jubilee%20Awards">UEFA Golden Player</a> of 1954–2003 and Belgium's Player of the Century by <a href="IFFHS">IFFHS</a>. At the <a href="1965%20Ballon%20d%27Or">1965 Ballon d'Or</a>, Van Himst ranked fourth, achieving Belgium's highest ever position at the European football election. Decades after Coppens and Van Himst had retired from playing football, a journalist on a Flemish television show asked them "Who [from both of you] was the best, actually?". Coppens replied: "I will ask Paul that ... If Paul says it was me, then he's right". In 1966, striker <a href="Raoul%20Lambert">Raoul Lambert</a> and defending midfielder <a href="Wilfried%20Van%20Moer">Wilfried Van Moer</a> joined the national team; while the UEFA praised Lambert for his skills at Euro 1972, Van Moer won three Golden Shoes and equalled Van Himst's fourth rank at the <a href="1980%20Ballon%20d%27Or">1980 Ballon d'Or</a>.

Belgium has seen two talented waves since 1980, from which several players in defensive positions gained international fame. In the 1980s and the early 1990s, goalkeepers <a href="Jean-Marie%20Pfaff">Jean-Marie Pfaff</a> and <a href="Michel%20Preud%27homme">Michel Preud'homme</a> were elected best <a href="Glossary%20of%20association%20football%20terms%23C">custodian</a>s at FIFA World Cups, while FIFA recognised midfielders <a href="Jan%20Ceulemans">Jan Ceulemans</a> and <a href="Enzo%20Scifo">Enzo Scifo</a> as the propelling forces of Belgium's 1986 FIFA World Cup squad. In 2002, after all players of this generation had retired, Marc Wilmots became Belgium's top scorer at the World Cup with five goals.

During the 12 years in which Belgium failed to qualify for major tournaments, another golden generation matured, most of whom later featured in foreign top football leagues; as of July 2013, 12 Belgian national team players would play the next season in the English Premier League. Five players of this generation gained both prime individual and team awards in foreign top competitions or European club competitions: defenders <a href="Vincent%20Kompany">Vincent Kompany</a> and <a href="Jan%20Vertonghen">Jan Vertonghen</a>, wingers <a href="Eden%20Hazard">Eden Hazard</a> and <a href="Kevin%20De%20Bruyne">Kevin De Bruyne</a>, and forward <a href="Kevin%20Mirallas">Kevin Mirallas</a>.

Belgium failed to progress past the first round of their earliest five World Cup participations. After two scoreless defeats at the <a href="1930%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">inaugural World Cup</a> in 1930, the team scored in their first-round knockout matches in <a href="1934%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">the 1934</a> and <a href="1938%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1938 editions</a>—but only enough to save their honour. In 1954, they tied with England (4–4 after extra time), and in 1970, they won their first World Cup match, against <a href="El%20Salvador%20national%20football%20team">El Salvador</a> (3–0).

From 1982 until 2002, Belgium qualified for six successive World Cups, and in the tournament finals they advanced beyond the first round five times. In the 1982 FIFA World Cup opener, Belgium beat defending champions Argentina 1–0. Their tournament ended in the second group stage, after a <a href="Poland%20national%20football%20team">Polish</a> hat-trick by <a href="Zbigniew%20Boniek">Zbigniew Boniek</a> and a 0–1 loss against the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20football%20team">Soviet Union</a>.

At Mexico 1986, the Belgian team achieved their then best-ever World Cup run at the time. In the knockout phase as <a href="Glossary%20of%20association%20football%20terms%23U">underdogs</a> they beat the Soviets after <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a> (3–4); the unnoticed offside position of Jan Ceulemans, during the initial ninety minutes, allowed him to <a href="equaliser%20%28sports%29">equalise</a> (2–2) and force the match into extra time. They also beat <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a>, in a <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shoot-out</a> after a 1–1 draw, but lost to eventual champions Argentina in the semi-final 2–0, and France in the third-place match (4–2).

In the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Belgium dominated periods of their second-round match against England; Enzo Scifo and Jan Ceulemans hit the <a href="Glossary%20of%20association%20football%20terms%23W">woodwork</a>. <a href="David%20Platt%20%28footballer%29">David Platt</a>'s <a href="Volley%20%28football%29">volley</a> in the final minute of extra time, described as "nearly blind" by Richard Witzig, avoided an apparently goalless draw and led to the sudden elimination of the Belgians.

In 1994, a 3–2 defeat to defending champions <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a> saw Belgium go out in the second round again. Afterwards, the entire Belgian delegation criticised referee <a href="Kurt%20R%C3%B6thlisberger">Kurt Röthlisberger</a> for not awarding a penalty for a <a href="Fouls%20and%20misconduct%20%28association%20football%29">foul</a> on Belgian <a href="Josip%20Weber">Josip Weber</a>. Three draws in the group stage of the 1998 World Cup were insufficient for Belgium to reach the knockout stage. With two draws, the 2002 FIFA World Cup started poorly for Belgium, but they won the decisive group match against Russia 3–2. In the second round, they faced eventual World Cup winners Brazil; Belgium lost 2–0 after Marc Wilmots' headed opening goal was disallowed due to a "phantom foul" on <a href="Roque%20J%C3%BAnior">Roque Júnior</a>, as Witzig named it.

In 2014, Belgium beat all their group opponents with a single-goal difference. Thereafter, they played an entertaining round of 16 match against the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">United States</a>, in which American goalkeeper <a href="Tim%20Howard">Tim Howard</a> made 15 saves. However, they defeated the United States 2–1 in extra time. In a balanced quarter-final, Argentina eliminated Belgium, after a 1–0 victory.

At the 2018 World Cup, Belgium started with five consecutive victories (including <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Group%20G">group wins</a> over <a href="Panama%20national%20football%20team">Panama</a>, <a href="Tunisia%20national%20football%20team">Tunisia</a> and England). In the fourth, in the round of 16 match against <a href="Japan%20national%20football%20team">Japan</a>, they suffered a major setback in the second half by being led 0–2, but goals from <a href="Jan%20Vertonghen">Jan Vertonghen</a> and late substitutes <a href="Marouane%20Fellaini">Marouane Fellaini</a> and <a href="Nacer%20Chadli">Nacer Chadli</a> led to an unlikely and historical comeback to 3–2. Belgium then defeated World Cup favourites Brazil 2–1 on the back of an early <a href="Fernandinho%20%28footballer%29">Fernandinho</a> <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a> and a goal by <a href="Kevin%20De%20Bruyne">Kevin De Bruyne</a>, so Belgium reached the <a href="semifinal">semifinal</a>s. <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> dominated the game but lost to <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> 0-1, on one of France's rare chances, in the Semi-Final thus losing the chance to play in the final of the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA 2018 World Cup</a>. They rebounded to win 2-0 in their second victory over <a href="England">England</a> in the tournament to secure third place and the best ever World Cup result for the Belgian national team.

With four successful qualification campaigns out of thirteen, Belgium's performance in the <a href="UEFA%20European%20Championship">European Championship</a> does not compare to their World Cup record. Belgium has hosted or co-hosted the event twice; they were chosen to accommodate the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201972">UEFA Euro 1972</a> from three candidates, and hosted <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000">UEFA Euro 2000</a> with the Netherlands.

At Euro 1972, Belgium finished third after losing 1–2 against West Germany and beating Hungary 2–1. The team's best continental result is their second place at <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201980">Euro 1980</a> in Italy. By finishing as <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201980%20Group%20B">group winners</a>, Belgium reached <a href="UEFA%20Euro%201980%20Final">the final</a>, to face West Germany. The West German <a href="Horst%20Hrubesch">Horst Hrubesch</a> scored first, but <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Vandereycken">René Vandereycken</a> equalised courtesy of a penalty. Two minutes before the regular playing time ended, Hrubesch scored again denying Belgium a first European title.

At Euro 1984, in their last and decisive group match against <a href="Denmark%20national%20football%20team">Denmark</a>, the Belgian team took a 0–2 lead, but the Danes won the match 3–2. Sixteen years later, Belgium automatically reappeared at UEFA's national team tournament as co-hosts. After winning the Euro 2000 opener against <a href="Sweden%20national%20football%20team">Sweden</a> 2–1, two 2–0 losses against eventual runners-up Italy and <a href="Turkey%20national%20football%20team">Turkey</a> eliminated the Belgians from the tournament by the end of the group stage.

In spite of winning with broad margins against the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Republic of Ireland</a> (3–0) and <a href="Hungary%20national%20football%20team">Hungary</a> (0–4) at Euro 2016, Belgium's second very talented generation disappointed with a quarter-final exit. As during the tournament's qualifiers, Wales got the better of Belgium, with a 3–1 win.

Football tournaments for senior men's national teams took place in six Summer Olympics between 1908 and 1936. The Belgian squad participated in all three <a href="Football%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">Olympic football tournaments</a> in the 1920s and kept the gold medal at home at the 1920 edition. Apart from the proper national team, two other Belgian delegations appeared at the Olympics. At the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201900%20Summer%20Olympics">1900 Summer Olympics</a>, <a href="Football%20at%20the%201900%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20team%20squads%23Universit.C3.A9%20de%20Bruxelles">a Belgian representation</a> with mainly students won bronze, and at <a href="Football%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">the 2008 edition</a>, Belgium's U-23 selection placed fourth.

<a href="Football%20at%20the%201920%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20team%20squads%23.C2.A0Belgium">Belgium's 1920 Olympic squad</a> was given a <a href="bye%20%28sports%29">bye</a> into the quarter-finals, where they won 3–1 against Spain, and reached the semi-finals, where they beat the Netherlands 3–0. In the first half of their final against Czechoslovakia, the Belgians led 2–0. Forward Robert Coppée converted a disputed early <a href="penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a>, and the action in which attacker <a href="Henri%20Larnoe">Henri Larnoe</a> doubled the score was also a matter of debate. After the <a href="fouls%20and%20misconduct%20%28association%20football%29%23Red%20card%20%28dismissal%29">dismissal</a> of the Czechoslovak left-back Karel Steiner, the discontented visitors left the pitch in the 40th minute. Afterwards, the away team reported their reasons for protest to the Olympic organisation; these complaints were dismissed and the Czechoslovaks were disqualified. The 2–0 score was allowed to stand and Belgium were crowned the champions.

, the complete official match record of the Belgian national team comprises <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team%20results">768 matches</a>: 324 wins, 164 draws and 280 losses. During these matches, the team scored 1,337 times and conceded 1,246 goals. Belgium's highest winning margin is nine goals, which has been achieved on three occasions: against <a href="Zambia%20national%20football%20team">Zambia</a> in 1994 (9–0), against <a href="San%20Marino%20national%20football%20team">San Marino</a> in 2001 (10–1) and against <a href="Gibraltar%20national%20football%20team">Gibraltar</a> in 2017 (9–0).

Lawrence Sullivan Ross

Lawrence Sullivan "Sul" Ross (September 27, 1838January 3, 1898) was the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Texas">19th Governor of Texas</a>, a <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a> general during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, and a president of the <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas</a>, now called <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Texas A&M University</a>.

Ross was raised in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>, which was later annexed to the United States. Much of his childhood was spent on the <a href="frontier">frontier</a>, where his family founded the town of <a href="Waco%2C%20Texas">Waco</a>. As a teenager, Ross attended <a href="Baylor%20University">Baylor University</a>. On one of his summer breaks, he suffered severe injuries while fighting <a href="Comanche">Comanche</a>s. After graduation, Ross joined the <a href="Texas%20Ranger%20Division">Texas Rangers</a>, and in 1860, led Texas Rangers in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pease%20River">Battle of Pease River</a>, where federal troops recaptured <a href="Cynthia%20Ann%20Parker">Cynthia Ann Parker</a>, who had been captured by the Comanches as a child in 1836.

When Texas seceded from the United States and joined the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>, Ross joined the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a>. He participated in 135 battles and skirmishes and became one of the youngest Confederate <a href="brigadier%20general">generals</a>. Following the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, Ross briefly served as sheriff of <a href="McLennan%20County%2C%20Texas">McLennan County</a> before resigning to participate in the 1875 Texas Constitutional Convention. With the exception of a two-year term as a <a href="Texas%20Legislature">state senator</a>, Ross spent the next decade focused on his farm and ranch concerns. In 1887, he became the 19th governor of Texas. During his two terms, he oversaw the dedication of the new <a href="Texas%20State%20Capitol">Texas State Capitol</a>, resolved the <a href="Jaybird-Woodpecker%20War">Jaybird-Woodpecker War</a>, and became the only Texas governor to call a special session to deal with a treasury surplus.

Despite his popularity, Ross refused to run for a third term as governor. Days after leaving office, he became president of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Texas A&M University</a>). He is credited with saving the school from closure, and his tenure saw a large expansion in college facilities and the birth of many <a href="Traditions%20of%20Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">school traditions</a>. After his death, the Texas legislature created <a href="Sul%20Ross%20State%20University">Sul Ross State University</a> in his honor.

Lawrence Sullivan Ross was born on September 27, 1838 in Bentonsport, <a href="Iowa%20Territory">Iowa Territory</a>. He was the fourth child and second son of Shapley Prince Ross and Catherine Fulkerson, the daughter of <a href="Missouri%20Legislature">Missouri legislator</a> <a href="Isaac%20Fulkerson">Isaac Fulkerson</a>. Ross was jointly named for his paternal uncle, Giles O. Sullivan, and his father's grandfather and brother, both named Lawrence Ross. The senior Lawrence Ross had been captured by <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> as a child, and lived with them from the time he was six years old until he was rescued at 23. To differentiate Ross from his uncle and great-grandfather, he was called "Little Sul" when he was a child, and later "Sul".

Shortly after Ross's birth, his parents sold their Iowa property and returned to Missouri to escape Iowa's cold weather. In 1839, the family moved to the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>, where they settled in the <a href="Robertson%20Colony">Robertson Colony</a> on the lower <a href="Brazos%20River">Brazos River</a>. Two years later, they joined seven other families under Captain Daniel Monroe and settled near present-day <a href="Cameron%2C%20Texas">Cameron</a>, where they received 640 <a href="acre">acre</a>s (260 <a href="hectares">ha</a>) of land along the Little River. Their land adjoined Comanche territory and was raided several times.

In 1845, the family moved to <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin</a> so Ross and his older siblings could attend school. Four years later, they relocated again. By this time, Shapley Ross was well known as a frontiersman, and to coax him to settle in the newly formed community of <a href="Waco%2C%20Texas">Waco</a>, the family was given four city lots, exclusive rights to operate a ferry across the <a href="Brazos%20River">Brazos River</a>, and the right to buy of farmland at <a href="US%24">US$</a>1 per acre. In March 1849, the Ross family built the first house in Waco, a double-log cabin on a bluff overlooking the springs. Ross's sister Kate soon became the first Caucasian child born in Waco.

Eager to further his education, Ross entered the Preparatory Department at <a href="Baylor%20University">Baylor University</a> (then in <a href="Independence%2C%20Texas">Independence, Texas</a>) in 1856, despite the fact that he was several years older than most of the other students. He completed the two-year study course in one year. Following his graduation, he enrolled at <a href="University%20of%20North%20Alabama">Wesleyan University</a> in <a href="Florence%2C%20Alabama">Florence, Alabama</a>. The Wesleyan faculty originally deemed his mathematics knowledge so lacking, they refused his admittance; the decision was rescinded after a professor agreed to tutor Ross privately in the subject. At Wesleyan, students lived with prominent families instead of congregating in dormitories, thus giving them "daily exposure to good manners and refinement". Ross lived with the family of his tutor.

During the summer of 1858, Ross returned to Texas and journeyed to the Brazos Indian Reserve, where his father served as <a href="Indian%20Agent">Indian Agent</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> had <a href="Conscription">conscripted</a> Indians from the reserve to help the "Wichita Expedition" of <a href="5th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Cavalry</a> in a search for <a href="Buffalo%20Hump">Buffalo Hump</a>, a Penateka Comanche chief who had led several deadly raids on Texas settlements. Fearing that Shapley Ross was too ill to command them on the expedition, the Indians named Sul Ross their new war chief. With his father's approval, the younger Ross led the 135 warriors to accompany 225 troops led by brevet Major <a href="Earl%20Van%20Dorn">Earl Van Dorn</a>. Ross was given the courtesy title of "Captain" during his command.

Native scouts found about 500 Comanches, including Buffalo Hump, camped outside a <a href="Wichita%20%28tribe%29">Wichita</a> village in <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a>. Early in the battle, Ross and his men successfully stampeded the Comanche horses, leaving the Comanche warriors at a disadvantage when facing the mounted troops. When many Comanche tried to flee the area, Ross, one of his scouts, Lieutenant Cornelius Van Camp of the 2nd Cavalry and one of his troopers chased a party of noncombatants that appeared to contain a white child. On Ross's orders, his man grabbed the child; as the four turned to rejoin the battle, they were confronted by 25 Comanche warriors. Van Camp and the private were killed with arrows, and Ross received an arrow through his shoulder. A Comanche picked up the trooper's carbine and fired a 0.58-caliber bullet through Ross's chest. His attacker, Mohee, was a Comanche brave Ross had known since childhood. Mohee was killed by buckshot fired by Lieutenant James Majors of the 2nd Cavalry as the warrior approached the temporarily paralyzed Ross with a <a href="scalping">scalping</a> knife.

After five hours of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants. Ross's injuries were severe, and for five days he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain. When he was able to travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders of his men. He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for much of the rest of the year.

In his written report, Van Dorn praised Ross highly. The "<a href="Dallas%20Herald">Dallas Herald</a>" printed the report on October 10, and other state newspapers also praised Ross's bravery. General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> learned of Ross's role and offered him a direct commission in the Army. Eager to finish his education, Ross declined Scott's offer and returned to school in Alabama.

The following year, Ross graduated from Wesleyan with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> and returned to Texas. Once there, he discovered no one had been able to trace the family of the young Caucasian girl rescued during the Wichita Village fight. He adopted the child and named her Lizzie Ross, in honor of his new fiancée, Lizzie Tinsley.

In early 1860, Ross enlisted in Captain J. M. Smith's Waco company of <a href="Texas%20Ranger%20Division">Texas Rangers</a>, which formed to fight the renegade Native Americans. Smith appointed Ross his <a href="Second%20Lieutenant%23United%20States">second lieutenant</a>. When Smith was promoted, the other men in the company unanimously voted to make Ross the new captain. In conjunction with several other Ranger companies, Ross led his men to retaliate against a <a href="Kickapoo%20people">Kickapoo</a> tribe which had murdered two white families. The tribe had been warned of the Rangers' approach and set the prairie ablaze. The Rangers were forced to abandon their mission when confronted with the massive wildfire.

Smith disbanded Ross's company in early September 1860. Within a week, Governor <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> authorized Ross to raise his own company of 60 mounted volunteers to protect the settlements near Belknap from Native American attacks. Ross and his men arrived at <a href="Fort%20Belknap%20%28Newcastle%2C%20Texas%29">Fort Belknap</a> on October 17, 1860 to find the local citizens they were sworn to protect had passed a resolution asking Ross to resign his commission and leave the frontier. The citizens erroneously believed the raiding was committed by Native Americans from the reservations, and they feared Ross's friendship with those on the reservations would make him ineffective.

In late October and November 1860, Comanches led by <a href="Peta%20Nocona">Peta Nocona</a> conducted numerous raids on various settlements, culminating in the brutal killing of a pregnant woman. On hearing of these incidents, Houston sent several 25-man companies to assist Ross. A citizen's posse had tracked the raiders to their winter village along the <a href="Pease%20River">Pease River</a>. As the village contained at least 500 warriors and many women and children, the posse returned to the settlements to recruit additional fighters. Ross requested help from the U.S. Army at Camp Cooper, which sent 21 troops.

Immediately after the soldiers arrived on December 11, Ross and 39 Rangers departed for the Comanche village. On December 13, they met the civilian posse, which had grown to 69 members. After several days of travel, the fast pace and poor foraging forced the civilians to stop and rest their horses. Twenty of the Rangers and all of the U.S.soldiers continued on. When they neared the village, Charles Goodnight scouted ahead. Hidden from view by a dust storm, he was able to get within of the village and saw signs that the tribe was preparing to move on. Realizing his own horses were too tired for a long pursuit, Ross resolved to attack immediately, before the civilians were able to rejoin the group. Ross lead the Rangers down the ridge, while the soldiers circled around to cut off the Comanche retreat.

A 2012 book, "Myth, Memory and Massacre: The Pease River Capture of Cynthia Ann Parker" by Texas Tech University history professor emeritus, Paul H. Carlson and Tom Crum details that there were only 15 Commanches in the camp at the time of the massacre. Seven men, women and children were killed and approximately seven or more escaped or were allowed to escape by U.S. soldiers who did not want to slaughter women and children. U.S. soldiers came upon a women who held a child over her head; the men did not shoot, but instead surrounded and stopped her. Ross admitted to a cousin of Cynthia Ann Parker that he played no hand in helped to rescue <a href="Cynthia%20Ann%20Parker">Cynthia Ann Parker</a> and her daughter, shown in 1861.
The civilian posse arrived at the battleground as the fighting finished. Although they initially congratulated Ross for winning the battle, some of them later complained that Ross had pushed ahead without them so he would not have to share the glory or the spoils of war.

When Cynthia Ann Parker was taken to Ft. Cooper, U.S. command realized the captured woman had blue eyes. The woman could not speak English and did not remember her birth name or details of her life prior to joining the Comanche. After much questioning, she was able to provide a few details of her capture as a child. The details matched what they knew of the 1836 <a href="Fort%20Parker%20Massacre">Fort Parker Massacre</a>, and they summoned Colonel <a href="Isaac%20Parker%20%28Texas%20politician%29">Isaac Parker</a> to identify her. When Parker mentioned his kidnapped niece had been named <a href="Cynthia%20Ann%20Parker">Cynthia Ann Parker</a>, the woman slapped her chest and said "Me Cincee Ann." Parker never returned to the Comanche people, but was not happy to have been rescued 
In contrast, the intervention was welcomed by a nine-year-old Mexican boy found hiding alone in the tall grass. Ross took the child with him, naming him Pease. Though Pease was later given the choice to return to his people, he refused and was raised by Ross.

The politically-inspired exaggerations and wrong information about the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pease%20River">Battle of Pease River</a> cemented Ross's fame. His "aggressive tactics of carrying the war to the Comanche fireside, (as it had long been carried to that of the white) ended charges of softness in dealing with the Indians." After Ross's death, however, Nocona's son <a href="Quanah%20Parker">Quanah Parker</a> maintained his father was not present at the battle, and instead died three or four years later. Quanah Parker identified the man Martinez shot as a Mexican captive who was the personal servant of Nocona's wife, Cynthia Ann Parker. A 2012 book, "Myth, Memory and Massacre: The Pease River Capture of Cynthia Ann Parker" by Texas Tech University history professor emeritus, Paul H. Carlson and Tom Crum debunks most of the material in the apparently politically inspired 1886 book of James T. Deshields. They also document the primary sources who verify that Peta Nacona was not at the scene of the massacre and died around 1865, not December 1860.

When Ross returned home, Houston asked him to disband the company and form a new company of 83 men, promising to send written directives soon. While Ross was in the process of supervising this reorganization, Houston appointed Captain William C. Dalrymple as his new "aide-de-camp" with overall command of the Texas Rangers. Dalrymple, unaware of Houston's verbal orders, castigated Ross for disbanding his company. Ross completed the reorganization of the company, then returned to Waco and resigned his commission. In his letter of resignation, effective February 1861, Ross informed Houston of his encounter with Dalrymple, and noted he did not believe a Ranger company could be effective if the captain did not report solely to the Governor. Houston offered to appoint Ross as an "aide-de-camp" with the rank of colonel, but Ross refused.

In early 1861 after Texas voted to <a href="secession">secede</a> from the United States and join the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>, Ross's brother Peter began recruiting men for a new <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">military company</a>. Shortly after Ross enlisted in his brother's company as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a>, Governor <a href="Edward%20Clark%20%28governor%29">Edward Clark</a> requested he instead proceed immediately to the <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a> to negotiate treaties with the <a href="Five%20Civilized%20Tribes">Five Civilized Tribes</a> so they would not help the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>. One week after his May 28 wedding to Lizzie Tinsley, Ross set out for the Indian Territory. Upon reaching the Washita Agency, he discovered the Confederate commissioners had already signed a preliminary treaty with the tribes.

Ross returned home for several months. In the middle of August, he departed, with his company, for Missouri, leaving his wife with her parents. On September 7, his group became Company G of Stone's Regiment, later known as the Sixth Texas Cavalry. The other men elected Ross as the major for the regiment. Twice in November 1861, Ross was chosen by <a href="Benjamin%20McCulloch">General McCulloch</a>, with whom he had served in the Texas Rangers, to lead a scouting force near <a href="Springfield%2C%20Missouri">Springfield, Missouri</a>. Both times, Ross successfully slipped behind the Union Army lines, gathered information, and retreated before being caught. After completing the missions, he was granted a 60-day leave and returned home to visit his wife.

In early 1862, Ross returned to duty. By late February, he and 500 troops were assigned to raid the Union Army. He led the group behind the enemy lines, to Keetsville (now Washburn)MO, where they gathered intelligence, destroyed several wagonloads of commissary supplies, captured 60 horses and mules, and took 11 prisoners. The following month, the regiment was assigned to Earl Van Dorn, now a Major General, with whom Ross had served during the battle at the Wichita Village. Under Van Dorn, the group suffered a defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pea%20Ridge">Battle of Pea Ridge</a>; Ross attributed their loss solely to Van Dorn, and blamed him for overmarching and underfeeding his troops, and for failing to properly coordinate the plan of attack. In April, the group was sent to <a href="Des%20Arc%2C%20Arkansas">Des Arc</a>, <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>. Because of the scarcity of forage, Ross's cavalry troop was ordered to dismount and send their horses back to Texas. The unit, now on foot, traveled to <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, arriving two weeks after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>. Ross soon caught a bad cold accompanied by a lingering fever, and was extremely ill for eight weeks. By the time he considered himself cured, his weight had dwindled to only 125 lb (57 kg).

Over Ross's protests, the men of the Sixth Regiment elected him colonel in 1862. He did not want the responsibility of the position and had not wanted to embarrass a friend who wanted the job. Their brigade commander, General <a href="Charles%20W.%20Phifer">Charles W. Phifer</a>, was often absent, leaving Ross in charge. Ross's actions impressed other officers, and several times during the summer of 1862, he was nominated for promotion to <a href="History%20of%20Confederate%20States%20Army%20Generals%23Brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a>. Although he was not promoted at that time, his unit was the only one of the 8–10 dismounted cavalry units in the area to be promised the return of their horses.

While still afoot, Ross and his men participated in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Corinth">Battle of Corinth</a>. Under Ross's command, his Texans twice captured Union guns at Battery Robinett. They were forced to retreat from their position each time as reinforcements failed to arrive. During the battle, Ross, who had acquired a horse, was bucked off, leading his men to believe he had been killed. He was actually unharmed. The Confederate Army retreated from the battle and found themselves facing more Union troops at <a href="Battle%20of%20Hatchie%27s%20Bridge">Hatchie's Bridge</a>. Ross led 700 riflemen to engage the Union troops. For three hours, his men held off 7,000 Union troops, repulsing three major enemy assaults.

The Sixth Cavalry's horses arrived soon after the battle, and the regiment was transferred to the cavalry brigade of Colonel <a href="William%20Hicks%20Jackson">William H. "Red" Jackson</a>. Ross was permitted to take a few weeks leave in November 1862 to visit his wife, and returned to his regiment in mid-January 1863. Several months later, his unit participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Thompson%27s%20Station">Battle of Thompson's Station</a>. In July, Major General <a href="Stephen%20D.%20Lee">Stephen D. Lee</a> created a new brigade with Ross at the helm; consisting of Ross's regiment and Colonel Richard A. Pinson's First Mississippi Cavalry. Near the same time, Ross received word that his first child had died, possibly stillborn.

Ross fell ill again in September 1863. From September 27 through March 1864, he suffered recurring attacks of fever and chills every three days, symptomatic of tertian <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. Despite his illness, Ross never missed a day of duty, and in early 1864 he was promoted to <a href="History%20of%20Confederate%20States%20Army%20Generals%23Brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a>, becoming the ninth-youngest general officer of the Confederate Army. Following his promotion, unit morale improved, and every one of his men re-enlisted.

In March 1864, Ross's brigade fought against African American soldiers for the first time at <a href="Yazoo%20City%2C%20Mississippi">Yazoo City, Mississippi</a>. After bitter fighting, the Confederates were victorious. During the surrender negotiations, the Union officer accused the Texans of murdering several captured African American soldiers. Ross claimed two of his men had likewise been killed after surrendering to Union troops.

Beginning in May, the brigade endured 112 consecutive days of skirmishes, comprising 86 separate clashes with the enemy. Though most of the skirmishes were small, by the end of the period, injuries and desertion had cut the regiment's strength by 25%. Ross was captured in late July at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brown%27s%20Mill">Battle of Brown's Mill</a>, but was quickly rescued by a successful Confederate cavalry counterattack.

Their last major military campaign was the <a href="Franklin-Nashville%20Campaign">Franklin-Nashville Campaign</a> of November and December 1864. Ross and his men led the Confederate advance into Tennessee. Between the beginning of November and December 27, his men captured 550 prisoners, several hundred horses, and enough overcoats and blankets to survive the winter chill. Only 12 of Ross's men were killed, with 70 wounded and five captured.

By the time Ross began a 90-day furlough on March 13, 1865, he had participated in 135 engagements with the enemy and his horse had been shot out from under him five times, yet he had escaped serious injury. With his leave approved, Ross hurried home to Texas to visit the wife he had not seen in two years. While at home, the Confederate Army began its surrender. He had not rejoined his regiment when it surrendered in <a href="Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Jackson, Mississippi</a>, on May 14, 1865. Because he was not present at the surrender, Ross did not receive a parole protecting him from arrest. As a Confederate Army officer over the rank of colonel, Ross was also exempted from President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson's</a> amnesty proclamation of May 29, 1865. To prevent his arrest and the confiscation of his property, on August 4, 1865, Ross applied for a special pardon for his treason against the United States. Johnson personally approved Ross's application on October 22, 1866, but Ross did not receive and formally accept the pardon until July 1867.

When the Civil War ended, Ross was just 26 years old. He owned of farmland along the <a href="Bosque%20River">South Bosque River</a> west of Waco, and in town. For the first time, he and his wife were able to establish their own home. They expanded their family, having eight children over the next 17 years.

Despite his federal pardon for being a Confederate general, Ross was disqualified from voting and serving as a juror by the first <a href="Reconstruction%20Act">Reconstruction Act</a> of March 2, 1867. This act, and the Supplementary Reconstruction Act passed three weeks later, disenfranchised anyone who had held a federal or state office before supporting the Confederacy.

Reconstruction did not harm Ross's fortune, and with hard work, he soon prospered. Shortly after the war ended, he bought of land in town from his parents for $1,500. By May 1869, he had purchased an additional of farmland for $400, and the following year his wife inherited of farmland from the estate of her father. Ross continued to buy land, and by the end of 1875, he owned over of farmland. Besides farming, Ross and his brother Peter also raised <a href="Shorthorn">Shorthorn</a> cattle. The two led several <a href="Cattle%20drives%20in%20the%20United%20States">trail drives</a> to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>. The combined farming and ranching incomes left Ross wealthy enough to build a house in the Waco city limits and to send his children to private school.

By 1873, Reconstruction in Texas was coming to an end. In December, Ross was elected sheriff of <a href="McLennan%20County%2C%20Texas">McLennan County</a>, "without campaigning or other solicitation". Ross promptly named his brother Peter a deputy, and within two years, they had arrested over 700 outlaws. In 1874, Ross helped establish the Sheriff's Association of Texas. After various state newspapers publicized the event, sheriffs representing 65 Texas counties met in <a href="Corsicana%2C%20Texas">Corsicana</a> in August 1874. Ross became one of a committee of three assigned to draft resolutions for the convention. They asked for greater pay for sheriffs in certain circumstances, condemned the spirit of mob law, and proposed that state law be modified so arresting officers could use force if necessary to "compel the criminal to obey the mandates of the law."

Ross resigned as sheriff in 1875 and was soon elected as a delegate to the <a href="Texas%20Constitution">1875 Texas Constitutional Convention</a>. One of three members appointed to wait upon convention president-elect E.B. Pickett, Ross was also named to a committee that would determine what officers and employees were needed by the convention. He sat on many other committees, including Revenue and Taxation, the Select Committee on Frontier Affairs, the Select Committee on Education, and the Standing Committee on the Legislative Department. Of the 68 days of the convention, Ross attended 63, voted 343 times, and missed or abstained from voting only 66 times.

When the convention concluded, Ross returned home and spent the next four years focusing on his farm. In 1880, he became an accidental candidate for <a href="Texas%20Legislature">Texas State Senator</a> from the 22nd District. The nominating convention deadlocked between two candidates, with neither receiving a two-thirds majority. As a compromise, one of the delegates suggested the group nominate Ross. Although no one asked Ross whether he wanted to run for office, the delegates elected him as their candidate. He agreed to the nomination to spare the trouble and expense of another convention.

Ross won the election with a large majority. Shortly after his arrival in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin</a>, his youngest son died. Ross returned home for a week to attend the funeral and help care for another son who was seriously ill. On returning to the state capital, he was assigned to the committees for Educational Affairs, <a href="Internal%20improvements">Internal Improvements</a>, Finance, Penitentiaries, Military Affairs (where he served as chairman), State Affairs, Contingent Expenses, Stock and Stock Raising, Agricultural Affairs, and Enrolled Bills. Ross introduced a petition on behalf of 500 citizens of McLennan County, requesting a <a href="prohibition">prohibition</a> amendment to be placed on the next statewide ballot; the <a href="Seventeenth%20Texas%20Legislature">legislature</a> did agree to place this on the next ballot.

Although the Texas Legislature typically meets once every two years, a fire destroyed the state capitol building in November 1881, and Ross was called to serve in a <a href="special%20session">special session</a> in April 1882. The session agreed to build a <a href="Texas%20State%20Capitol">new capitol building</a>. Near the end of the special session, the Senate passed a reapportionment bill, which reduced Ross's four-year term to only two years. He declined to run again.

As early as 1884, Ross's friends, including Victor M. Rose, the editor of the newspaper in <a href="Victoria%2C%20Texas">Victoria</a>, had encouraged Ross to run for <a href="Texas%20governor">governor</a>. He declined and asked his friend George Clark to attend the 1884 state Democratic convention to prevent Ross from being named the gubernatorial candidate. Clark had to produce written authorization from Ross to convince the delegates to nominate someone else. Ross changed his mind in late 1885, announcing his candidacy for governor on February 25, 1886. During the campaign, he was variously accused of pandering to the <a href="Greenbacker">Greenbacker</a>s, the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a>, and the Knights. Ross spent no money on his campaign other than traveling expenses, but still handily won the Democratic nomination. He won the general election with 228,776 votes, compared with 65,236 for the Republican candidate and 19,186 from the Prohibitionist candidate. Much of his support came from Confederate veterans.

Ross became the 19th governor of Texas. His inauguration ball was held at the newly opened <a href="Driskill%20Hotel">Driskill Hotel</a>, a tradition followed by every subsequent Texas governor. Under the 1876 Texas Constitution, which he had helped write, the governor was granted the power to be commander-in-chief, to convene the legislature, to act as executor of the laws, to direct trade with other states, to grant pardons, and to veto bills. His campaign had focused on land use reform, as most of the frontier issues now resulted from disagreements over the use of public land, especially between farmers and ranchers concerned with water rights and grazing issues. At Ross's urging, the <a href="Nineteenth%20Texas%20Legislature">legislature</a> passed laws to restore the power of the Land Office Commissioner, provide punishments for those using state lands illegally, and to catalog existing public lands.

In May 1888, Ross presided over the dedication of the new <a href="Texas%20State%20Capitol">Texas State Capitol</a> building. Later that year, Ross ran relatively unopposed for a second term. His platform included abolishing the national banking system, regulating monopolies, reducing tariffs, and allowing the railroads to regulate themselves through competition. No other Democrats placed their names in contention at the nominating convention, and the Republicans chose not to select a candidate, as they were happy with Ross's performance. His sole competition was a Prohibitionist whom Ross defeated by over 151,000 votes. In his second inaugural address, Ross, a true <a href="Jeffersonian%20democrat">Jeffersonian Democrat</a>, maintained, "a plain, simple government, with severe limitations upon delegated powers, honestly and frugally administered, as the noblest and truest outgrowth of the wisdom taught by its founders."

During his second term, Ross was forced to intervene in the <a href="Jaybird-Woodpecker%20War">Jaybird-Woodpecker War</a> in <a href="Fort%20Bend%20County%2C%20Texas">Fort Bend County</a>. Sheriff Jim Garvey feared there would be armed battles between the white supremacist Democrats (the Jaybirds) and the black men who had retained political power (who, with their white supporters, were known as Woodpeckers). At Garvey's request, Ross sent two militia companies, which managed to impose a four-month peace. In August 1889, Ross sent four Texas Rangers, including Sergeant <a href="Ira%20Aten">Ira Aten</a>, to quell the unrest. Violence erupted, leaving four people dead and injuring six, including a Ranger. Aten wired Ross for help. The following morning, the Houston Light Guard arrived and instituted martial law; that evening, Ross arrived with an Assistant <a href="Texas%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> and another militia company. Ross fired all the local civil officials and called together representatives from both factions. On his suggestion, the two groups agreed to choose a mutually acceptable sheriff to replace Garvey, who had been killed in the firefight. When they could not agree on a candidate, Ross suggested Aten; both groups finally agreed, thus halting the conflict.

In March 1890, the <a href="U.S.%20Attorney%20General">U.S. Attorney General</a> launched a suit in the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">Supreme Court</a> against Texas to determine ownership of a disputed plot of land in <a href="Greer%20County%2C%20Texas">Greer County</a>. Determined to meet personally with the Attorney General, Ross and his wife traveled to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, where they visited President <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> at the White House. Following that visit, they traveled to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, where they met with former president <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>. While in New York, Ross was extremely popular with journalists. He was interviewed by several large northeastern newspapers, which recounted in detail many of his exploits along the frontier. According to his biographer Judith Brenner, the trip and the resulting exposure for Ross, "excited much interest in Texas among easterners, an interest that would eventually bear fruit in increased investment, tourism, and immigration".

Ross declined to become the first Texas governor to run for a third term, and left office on January 20, 1891. During his four years in office, he vetoed only ten bills, and pardoned 861 people. Compared to other Texas governors, these are small numbers; Governor <a href="Miriam%20A.%20Ferguson">Miriam A. Ferguson</a> granted 1161 pardons in just two years.

During his time in office, Ross proposed tax reform laws intended to provide for more equitable assessments of property—at that time, people were allowed to assess their own belongings with little oversight. The legislature passed his recommendations, and approved his plan to exert more control over school funds and to require local taxation to support the public schools. He also encouraged the legislature to enact antitrust laws. These were passed March 30, 1889, a full year before the federal government enacted the <a href="Sherman%20Antitrust%20Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a>. His reform acts were beneficial for the state, leading Ross to become the only Texas governor to call a special session of the legislature to deal with a treasury surplus.

During his term, the legislature agreed to allow the public to vote on a state constitutional amendment for the prohibition of alcohol. Ross vehemently opposed the measure, saying, "No government ever succeeded in changing the moral convictions of its subjects by force." The amendment was defeated by over 90,000 votes.

When Ross took the governor's oath of office, Texas had only four charitable institutions—two insane asylums, an institute for the blind, and an institute for the deaf and dumb. By the time he left office, Ross had supervised the opening of a state orphan's home, a state institute for deaf, dumb, and blind black children, and a branch asylum for the insane. He also convinced the legislature to set aside near <a href="Gatesville%2C%20Texas">Gatesville</a> for a future open farm reformatory for juvenile offenders.

Ross was the first governor to set aside a day for civic improvements, declaring the third Friday in January to be <a href="Arbor%20Day">Arbor Day</a>, when schoolchildren should endeavor to plant trees. He also supported the legislature's efforts to purchase the Huddle portrait gallery, a collection of paintings of each governor of Texas. These paintings continue to hang in the rotunda of the Texas State Capitol.

Ross felt strongly that the state should adequately care for its veterans. During his first term, the first Confederate home in Texas was dedicated in Austin. Within two years, the facility had run out of room, so Ross served as chairman of a committee to finance a relocation to a larger facility. By August 1890, the home had collected enough money to move to a larger location.

Samuel Willis Tucker Lanham was the last governor of Texas who also served as a Confederate soldier in the Civil War, January 20, 1903 to January 15, 1907.

By the late 1880s, rumors abounded of "poor management, student discontent, professorial dissatisfaction, faculty factionalism, disciplinary problems, and campus scandals" at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Texas A&M University</a>). The public was skeptical of the idea of scientific agriculture and the legislature declined to appropriate money for improvements to the <a href="Campus%20of%20Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">campus</a> because it had little confidence in the school's administrators. The board of directors decided the school, known as Texas AMC, needed to be run by an independent administrative chief rather than the faculty chairman. On July 1, 1890, the board unanimously agreed to offer the new job to the sitting governor and asked Ross to resign his office immediately. Ross agreed to consider the offer, as well as several others he had received. An unknown person informed several newspapers that Ross had been asked to become Texas AMC's president, and each of the newspapers editorialized that Ross would be a perfect fit. The college had been founded to teach military and agricultural knowledge, and Ross had demonstrated excellence in the army and as a farmer. His gubernatorial service had honed his administrative skills, and he had always expressed an interest in education.

Though Ross was concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest, as he had appointed many of the board members who had elected him, he announced he would accept the position. As the news of his acceptance spread throughout the state, prospective students flocked to Texas AMC. Many of the men Ross had supervised during the Civil War wanted their sons to study under their former commander, and 500 students attempted to enroll at the beginning of the 1890–1891 school year. Three hundred and sixteen students were admitted, though the facilities were only designed for 250 scholars. When Ross officially took charge of the school on February 2, the campus had no running water, faced a housing shortage, was taught by disgruntled faculty, and many students were running wild.

The board of directors named Ross the treasurer of the school, and he posted a $20,000 personal bond "for the faithful performance of his duty". In the break between school years, Ross instituted a number of changes. When students returned for the 1891–1892 school year, they found a new three-story dormitory with 41 rooms (named Ross Hall), the beginning of construction on a new home for the president, and a new building to house the machine and blacksmith shops. The minimum age for enrollment decreased from 16 to 15, and Ross now personally interviewed all prospective students to determine if they should be admitted. Fees and expenses rose by $10 per session, and the number of hours required for graduation increased, including additional hours in English grammar, sciences, mathematics, and history. Additionally, Ross would now appoint the officers for the <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20Corps%20of%20Cadets">Corps of Cadets</a>, and the name of the company of best-drilled cadets in the Corps would change to the Ross Volunteers (from Scott Volunteers). Finally, Ross enacted an official prohibition against hazing, vowing to expel any student found guilty of the practice. Although Ross professed to enjoy his new position, he wrote to several people that directing the college "made me turn gray very fast."

Enrollment continued to rise, and by the end of his tenure, Ross requested that parents first communicate with his office before sending their sons to the school. The increase in students necessitated an improvement in facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed. Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross's leadership, and Ross ensured the money was returned to the students in the form of lower fees.

Ross made himself accessible to students and participated in school activities whenever possible. Those around him found him "slow to condemn but ready to encourage ... [and they] could not recall hearing Ross use profanity or seeing him visibly angry." Every month, he prepared grade sheets for each student and would often call poorly performing students into his office for a discussion of their difficulties. Under his leadership, the military aspect of the college was emphasized. However, he eliminated many practices he considered unnecessary, including marching to and from class, and he reduced the amount of guard time and the number of drills the students were expected to perform.

Although enrollment had always been limited to men, Ross favored coeducation, as he thought the male cadets "would be improved by the elevating influence of the good girls". In 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of a Texas AMC professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. Several years later, her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903, and slowly other daughters of professors were allowed to attend classes.

During Ross's tenure, many enduring <a href="Traditions%20of%20Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Texas A&M traditions</a> formed. These include the first <a href="Traditions%20of%20texas%20a%26amp%3Bm%23Aggie%20Ring">Aggie Ring</a> and the formation of the <a href="Fightin%27%20Texas%20Aggie%20Band">Aggie Band</a>. Ross's tenure also saw the school's first intercollegiate <a href="American%20football">football</a> game, played against the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas</a>. Many student organizations were founded in this time period, including the Fat Man's Club, the Bowlegged Men's Club, the Glee Club (now known as the <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20Singing%20Cadets">Singing Cadets</a>), the Bicycle Club, and the College Dramatic Club. In 1893, students began publishing a monthly newspaper, "<a href="The%20Battalion">The Battalion</a>", and two years later, they began publishing an annual yearbook, known as "The Olio".

Ross was an active freemason having become a master mason at the lodge his father helped create in 1851, <a href="http%3A//www.wacomasonic.org">Waco Masonic Lodge #92</a>, and as a member there, Ross was involved with the development of the new city with the same name.

Ross continued to be active in veteran's organizations, and in 1893, he became the first commander of the Texas Division of the <a href="United%20Confederate%20Veterans">United Confederate Veterans</a>. He was re-elected president several times and served one term as commander-in-chief of the entire United Confederate Veterans organization. During that time, a <a href="Daughters%20of%20the%20Confederacy">Daughters of the Confederacy</a> chapter established in <a href="Bryan%2C%20Texas">Bryan</a> was named the L.S. Ross Chapter.

In 1894, Ross was appointed to a seat on the <a href="Railroad%20Commission%20of%20Texas">Railroad Commission of Texas</a>. While he pondered whether to resign his position and accept the appointment, letters and petitions poured into his office begging him to remain at Texas AMC. He declined the appointment and remained president of the college.

Ross had always been an avid hunter, and he embarked on a hunting trip along the Navasota River with his son Neville and several family friends during Christmas vacation in 1897. While hunting, he suffered acute indigestion and a severe chill and decided to go home early while the others continued their sport. He arrived in <a href="College%20Station%2C%20Texas">College Station</a> on December 30 and consulted a doctor. Ross remained in pain for several days, and in the early evening of January 3, 1898, he died, aged 59 years and 3 months. Although no death certificate was filed, "evidence points to a coronary heart attack as the probable cause of death." The entire Texas AMC student body accompanied Ross's body back to Waco, where Confederate veterans in gray uniforms formed an honor guard. Several thousand people attended Ross's burial at <a href="Oakwood%20Cemetery%20%28Waco%2C%20Texas%29">Oakwood Cemetery</a>. To further memorialize him, students at Texas AMC held the first <a href="Silver%20Taps">Silver Taps</a> ceremony, a tradition still followed when a current student at Texas A&M dies.

The morning after Ross's death, the "<a href="Dallas%20Morning%20News">Dallas Morning News</a>" published an editorial, quoted in several biographies of Ross:

It has been the lot of few men to be of such great service to Texas as Sul Ross. ... Throughout his life he has been closely connected with the public welfare and ... discharged every duty imposed upon him with diligence, ability, honesty and patriotism. ... He was not a brilliant chieftain in the field, nor was he masterful in the art of politics, but, better than either, he was a well-balanced, well-rounded man from whatever standpoint one might estimate him. In his public relations he exhibited sterling common sense, lofty patriotism, inflexible honesty and withal a character so exalted that he commanded at all times not only the confidence but the affection of the people. ... He leaves a name that will be honored as long as chivalry, devotion to duty and spotless integrity are standards of our civilization and an example which ought to be an inspiration to all young men of Texas who aspire to careers of public usefulness and honorable renown.

Within weeks of Ross's death, former cadets at Texas AMC began gathering funds for a monument. In 1917, the state appropriated $10,000 for the monument, and two years later, a 10-ft (3 m) bronze statue of Ross, sculpted by <a href="Pompeo%20Coppini">Pompeo Coppini</a>, was unveiled at the center of the Texas AMC campus. In more recent years, students began the <a href="Traditions%20of%20Texas%20A%26amp%3Bm%20University%23Asking%20for%20luck">tradition</a> of placing pennies at the feet of statue before exams for good luck. School legend states that Ross would often tutor students, and as payment would accept only a penny for their thoughts. At exam time, his statue, located in Academic Plaza, is often covered in pennies. Country singer <a href="Granger%20Smith">Granger Smith</a>, an A&M graduate, wrote a song titled "We Bleed Maroon", with a chorus having the line "put a penny on old Sully and wish me some luck" in homage to this student tradition.

At the same time they appropriated money for the statue, the legislature established the Sul Ross Normal College, now <a href="Sul%20Ross%20State%20University">Sul Ross State University</a> in <a href="Alpine%2C%20Texas">Alpine, Texas</a>. The college opened for classes in June 1920.

In 1998, a few activists on the Texas A&M campus objected to his statue on the basis that Ross might have been friends with some members of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. As stated above, after an exhaustive search, no documented evidence has ever been found to show that Ross had any association with the Klan. The previously mentioned activists wanted to create a "diversity plaza", with a statue of African-American politician <a href="Matthew%20Gaines">Matthew Gaines</a>.

Horatio Bottomley

Horatio William Bottomley (23 March 1860 – 26 May 1933) was an English financier, journalist, editor, newspaper proprietor, swindler, and Member of Parliament. He is best known for his editorship of the popular magazine "<a href="John%20Bull%20%28magazine%29">John Bull</a>", and for his patriotic oratory during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. His career came to a sudden end when, in 1922, he was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.

Bottomley spent five years in an orphanage before beginning his career, aged 14, as an errand boy. Subsequent experience as a solicitor's clerk gave him a useful knowledge of <a href="English%20law">English law</a>, which he later put to effective use in his court appearances. After working as a shorthand writer and court reporter, at 24 he founded his own publishing company, which launched numerous magazines and papers, including, in 1888, the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>". He over-reached himself with an ambitious <a href="Initial%20public%20offering">public flotation</a> of his company, which led to his first arraignment on fraud charges in 1893. Despite evidence of malpractice, Bottomley, who defended himself, was acquitted. He subsequently amassed a fortune as a promoter of shares in gold-mining companies.

In 1906 Bottomley entered parliament as <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> member for <a href="Hackney%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Hackney South</a>. In the same year he founded the popular magazine "John Bull", which became a platform for Bottomley's trenchant populist views. Financial extravagance and mismanagement continued to blight his career, and in 1912 he had to resign from parliament after being declared bankrupt. The outbreak of war in 1914 revived his fortunes; as a journalist and orator Bottomley became a leading propagandist for the war effort, addressing well over 300 public meetings. His influence was such that it was widely expected that he would enter the War Cabinet, although he received no such offer.

In 1918, having been discharged from bankruptcy, Bottomley re-entered parliament as an Independent member. In the following year he launched his fraudulent "Victory Bonds" scheme which, when exposed, led to his conviction, imprisonment and expulsion from parliament. Released in 1927, he attempted unsuccessfully to relaunch his business career, and eked out a living by lecturing and appearances in music halls. His final years before his death in 1933 were spent in poverty.

Bottomley was born on 23 March 1860, at 16 Saint Peter's Street, <a href="Bethnal%20Green">Bethnal Green</a> in London, the second child and only son of William Bottomley, a tailor's cutter, and Elizabeth, née Holyoake. William Bottomley's background is obscure, but Elizabeth belonged to a family of well-known radical agitators—her brother <a href="George%20Jacob%20Holyoake">George Jacob Holyoake</a> was a founder of the <a href="Secularism">Secularist</a> movement and in later life a leading figure in the growth of <a href="History%20of%20the%20cooperative%20movement">Co-operative societies</a>. 

Among Holyoake's close associates was <a href="Charles%20Bradlaugh">Charles Bradlaugh</a>, who founded the National Republican League and became a controversial Member of Parliament. A longstanding friendship between Bradlaugh and Elizabeth Holyoake led to rumours that he, not William Bottomley, was Horatio's biological father—a suggestion that Bottomley, in later life, was prone to encourage. The evidence is circumstantial, mainly based on the marked facial resemblance between Bradlaugh and Bottomley.

William Bottomley died in 1864 and Elizabeth a year later. Horatio and his elder sister, Florence, were initially looked after by their uncle William Holyoake, an artist living in the London district of <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>. After a year they were boarded out to foster-parents, at their uncle George Jacob's expense. This arrangement lasted until 1869, when Florence was formally adopted by her foster-family. At this point Holyoake felt unable to continue supporting Horatio financially, and arranged for him to be admitted to <a href="Josiah%20Mason">Josiah Mason</a>'s orphanage in <a href="Erdington">Erdington</a>, Birmingham. This was Horatio's home for the following five years. Some biographers have emphasised the cruelty and humiliation of his time there; while discipline was certainly harsh, Horatio received a useful basic education, and won prizes for sporting activities. In later life he showed no resentment towards the institution, which he often visited, telling the children that "any success I have achieved in life started at this place."

In 1874, when Horatio was 14 and due to leave the orphanage, he ran away without waiting for the formalities. His aunt Caroline Praill—his mother's sister—who lived in nearby <a href="Edgbaston">Edgbaston</a>, gave him a home, while he worked as an errand boy in a Birmingham building firm. This arrangement lasted only a few months before Horatio, impatient to be reunited with his sister from whom he had been separated for six years, went to London where he began an apprenticeship with a wood engraver.

Bottomley soon gave up his apprenticeship, and after a series of humdrum jobs found work in the offices of a <a href="City%20of%20London">City</a> firm of <a href="solicitors">solicitors</a>. Here he picked up a working knowledge of English legal procedures, and was soon carrying a workload far exceeding the normal duties of an office junior. With his uncle's encouragement he learned shorthand at Pitman's College, a skill which helped him to get a better job with a larger legal firm. He also came into closer contact with the Holyoake circle, where he acted as an unpaid assistant in the group's publishing activities. He met Bradlaugh, who encouraged the young man to read more widely and introduced him to the ideas of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Thomas Huxley</a> and <a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>. Bottomley was strongly influenced by Bradlaugh, whom he considered his political and spiritual mentor.

In 1880 Bottomley married Eliza Norton, the daughter of a debt collector. Bottomley's biographers have tended to regard this early, unambitious marriage as a mistake on his part; she was not equipped, intellectually or socially, to help him advance in the world. In the same year, Bottomley left his job to become a full-time shorthand writer for Walpole's, a firm that provided recording and transcription services for the law courts. His competence impressed his employers sufficiently for them, in 1883, to offer him a partnership, and the firm became Walpole and Bottomley. As Bottomley emerged from adolescence to maturity he began to show signs of the characteristics that would be much in evidence in his later life: greed for fleshly pleasures, a thirst for fame, spontaneous generosity, combined with a charm that, according to his biographer <a href="Julian%20Symons">Julian Symons</a>, could "tempt the banknotes out of men's pockets".

Bottomley's association with Bradlaugh had awakened his interests in publishing and politics, and in 1884 he launched his first entrepreneurial venture, a magazine called the "Hackney Hansard". This journal recorded the business of Hackney's local "parliament"—essentially a debating society that mirrored the proceedings at Westminster. Advertisements from local tradesmen kept the paper mildly profitable. Bottomley produced a sister-paper, the "Battersea Hansard", covering that borough's local parliament, before merging the two into "The Debater". 

In 1885 he formed the Catherine Street Publishing Association and, using borrowed capital, acquired or started several magazines and papers. These included, among others, the "Municipal Review", a prestigious local government publication; "Youth", a boys' paper on which <a href="Alfred%20Harmsworth%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Northcliffe">Alfred Harmondsworth</a>, the future press magnate Lord Northcliffe, worked as a sub-editor; and the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>". The last-named was set up to rival the "<a href="Financial%20News%20%281884-1945%29">Financial News (1884-1945)</a>", London's first specialist business paper, which had been started in 1884 by <a href="Harry%20Marks">Harry Marks</a>, a former sewing-machine salesman. In 1886 Bottomley's company acquired its own printing works through a merger with the printing firm of MacRae and Co., and after the absorption of another advertising and printing firm, became MacRae, Curtice and Company.

At the age of 26, Bottomley became the company's chairman. His advance in the business world was attracting wider notice, and in 1887 he was invited by the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> in <a href="Hornsey%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Hornsey</a> to be their candidate in a parliamentary by-election. He accepted, and although defeated, fought a strong campaign which won him a congratulatory letter from <a href="William%20Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>. His business affairs were proceeding less serenely; he quarrelled with his partner Douglas MacRae, and the two decided to separate. Bottomley described the "Quixotic impulse" that led him to let MacRae divide the assets: "He was a printer, and I was a journalist—but he took the papers and left me the printing works".

Undismayed by the loss of his papers, Bottomley embarked on an ambitious expansion scheme. On the basis of a lucrative contract to print the <a href="Hansard">Hansard</a> reports of debates in the Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, <a href="Initial%20public%20offering">floated</a> on the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> with a capital of £500,000. Bottomley boosted the company's credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company's board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor-elect of London</a>, Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry Marks) of the London "<a href="The%20Evening%20News%20%28London%20newspaper%29">Evening News</a>", and <a href="Roper%20Lethbridge">Sir Roper Lethbridge</a>, the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> MP for <a href="Kensington%20North%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Kensington North</a>. 

This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of several printing businesses—he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions. He also persuaded the board to give him £75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired. These outgoings and other expenses absorbed the Union's capital, and with few significant revenue streams it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any statement of accounts, in July 1890 Bottomley announced a profit for the year of £40,877, and declared a dividend of eight per cent.

The funds for the dividend payment were raised by a <a href="debenture">debenture</a> of £50,000. By the end of 1890 many City figures were suspicious of the Hansard Union, and were calling it "Bottomley's swindle". Despite Bottomley's outward optimism, in December 1890 the company defaulted on the payment of debenture interest and in May 1891, amid growing rumours of insolvency, the debenture holders petitioned for the company's compulsory winding-up. In the same month Bottomley, who had taken at least £100,000 from the company, filed a petition for <a href="Bankruptcy%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">bankruptcy</a>. Under examination by the <a href="Official%20Receiver">Official Receiver</a>, he could not say where the money had gone, and professed total ignorance of the company's book-keeping. After further enquiries, the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> instituted prosecutions for fraud against Bottomley, Isaacs and two others.

The trial began in the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court of Justice</a> on 30 January 1893, before <a href="Henry%20Hawkins%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brampton">Sir Henry Hawkins</a>; Bottomley conducted his own defence. To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable. It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for far less than the prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted commercial practice, and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument was that he was the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company. On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.

The Hansard Union case, far from damaging Bottomley's reputation, had left a general impression that he was a financial genius. He avoided the stigma of bankruptcy by arranging a scheme of repayment with his creditors, and swiftly embarked on a new career promoting <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>n gold mining shares. The discovery of gold in <a href="Kalgoorlie">Kalgoorlie</a> and adjoining areas in the early 1890s had created an easily exploitable investment boom; as Bottomley's biographer Alan Hyman observes, "A hole in the ground ... could be boosted into a very promising gold-mine, and investors only found that they had backed a loser after the mine had been floated as a public company and they had paid hard cash for their shares". 

By 1897, through skilful exploitation of demand and by frequent reconstruction of failing companies, Bottomley had accumulated a considerable personal fortune. It was, the historian <a href="A.%20J.%20A.%20Morris">A.J.A. Morris</a> asserts, "a truly amazing success story, the product of reckless audacity, astonishing energy, and extreme good fortune". Bottomley won plaudits when he announced that he would pay £250,000 to the creditors of the Hansard Union; the bulk of this payment was offered in shares in one or other of his mining promotions.

As his wealth increased, Bottomley adopted an increasingly ostentatious lifestyle. In London he lived in a luxurious apartment in <a href="Pall%20Mall%2C%20London">Pall Mall</a>. He took numerous mistresses, whom he visited in several discreet flats in different districts of London. He owned several racehorses, which achieved prestigious victories—the <a href="Stewards%27%20Cup%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Stewards' Cup</a> at <a href="Goodwood%20Racecourse">Goodwood</a>, and the <a href="Cesarewitch%20Handicap">Cesarewitch</a> at <a href="Newmarket%20Racecourse">Newmarket</a>—but he often lost large sums through unwise bets. Quite early in his rise to wealth he bought a modest property in <a href="Upper%20Dicker">Upper Dicker</a>, near <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a> in East Sussex. He called it "The Dicker", and over the years extended and developed it into a large country mansion, where he entertained extravagantly.

Bottomley had retained his parliamentary ambitions and in 1890, before the Hansard Union crash, had been adopted as the Liberal candidate for <a href="Islington%20North%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North Islington</a>. According to Symons, when he resigned the candidature on the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, he had the constituency in his pocket. By 1900 his star was again in the ascendant, and he was invited by the <a href="Hackney%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Hackney South</a> Liberals to be their candidate in that year's <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201900">general election</a>. He lost by only 280 votes, after a bitterly fought campaign in which Bottomley was described in a newspaper article as a "bare-faced swindler ... [whose] ... place is at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>, not at Westminster". He was subsequently awarded £1,000 libel damages against the writer, Henry Hess.

By the turn of the 19th–20th centuries the boom in speculative shares had abated; some of Bottomley's fellow promoters, such as <a href="Whitaker%20Wright">Whitaker Wright</a>, were facing charges of fraud and misrepresentation. Bottomley ceased his operations, and resumed his earlier role of newspaper proprietor. In 1902 he bought a failing London evening paper, "<a href="The%20Sun%20%281893%E2%80%931906%29">The Sun</a>", to which he contributed a regular column, "The World, the Flesh and the Devil". Another feature was Bottomley's employment of celebrity guest editors for special edition; among these were the comedian <a href="Dan%20Leno">Dan Leno</a>, the cricketer <a href="Ranjitsinhji">Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji</a> and the labour leader <a href="Ben%20Tillett">Ben Tillett</a>. The paper was not a financial success, and Bottomley sold it in 1904. He had not given up altogether on speculative money-making schemes, and in 1905 he began an association with the financier <a href="Ernest%20Terah%20Hooley">Ernest Hooley</a>. Among their joint enterprises was the promotion of the defunct, dry <a href="Basingstoke%20Canal">Basingstoke Canal</a> as a major inland waterway, the "London and South-Western Canal". Bottomley later made a substantial out-of-court settlement of an action brought by investors who had bought worthless shares in the canal.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201906">general election of January 1906</a> Bottomley was again the Liberal candidate for Hackney South. After a vigorous campaign he defeated his Conservative opponent by more than 3,000—the largest Liberal majority in London, he informed the House of Commons in his maiden speech on 20 February 1906. According to Hyman, this speech was received in "chilling silence" by a House that was well aware of Bottomley's chequered reputation. 

Over the following months and years he overcame much of the initial hostility, partly by his self-deprecating good humour (as when he described himself as "more or less honourable") but also because his populist approach to legislation was attractive. He proposed rational reforms of the betting industry and of licensing hours, and the introduction of state Old Age Pensions. Extra revenues could be raised, he suggested, by stamp duty on share transfers, taxes on foreign investment, and by appropriating dormant bank balances. He drew the government's attention to the long hours worked by domestic servants, and introduced a private bill limiting the working day to eight hours. He privately confided to the journalist <a href="Frank%20Harris">Frank Harris</a> that his ambition was to become <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>.
Alongside his parliamentary duties, Bottomley was engaged in launching his biggest and boldest publishing venture, the weekly news magazine "<a href="John%20Bull%20%28magazine%29">John Bull</a>", half of the initial capital for which was provided by Hooley. From its first issue on 12 May 1906 "John Bull" adopted a <a href="Tabloid%20journalism">tabloid</a> style that, despite occasional lapses in taste, proved immensely popular. Among its regular features, Bottomley revived his "The World, the Flesh and the Devil" column from "The Sun", and also adapted that paper's slogan: "If you read it in John Bull, it is so". Bottomley persuaded <a href="Julius%20Elias%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Southwood">Julius Elias</a>, managing director of <a href="Odhams%20Press">Odhams Limited</a>, to handle the printing, but chaotic financial management meant that Odhams were rarely paid. This situation was resolved when the entire management of the magazine, including the handling of all receipts and payments, was transferred to Elias, leaving Bottomley free to concentrate on editing and journalism. Circulation rose rapidly, and by 1910 had reached half a million copies.

In June 1906 Bottomley announced the John Bull Investment Trust, in which, for a minimum subscription of £10, investors could share "that special and exclusive information which is obtainable only as the result of extensive City experience". Bottomley's earlier City activities were coming under scrutiny, particularly the multiple reconstructions of his now-bankrupt Joint Stock Trust Company. After a long investigation, which Bottomley did all he could to frustrate, in December 1908 he was summoned to appear at the <a href="Guildhall%2C%20London">Guildhall Justice Room</a>, before a court of aldermen. As with the Hansard prosecution, the case against Bottomley appeared overwhelming; share issues in the Joint Stock Trust had been repeatedly re-issued, perhaps as many as six times. Once again Bottomley succeeded in obscuring the details and, by the power of his courtroom oratory, persuaded the court that the summons should be dismissed.

One of the prosecuting team at the Guildhall observed that it would be a long time before anyone risked another prosecution against Bottomley: "But he might ... grow careless, and then he will fail". Despite the adverse publicity, Bottomley was returned by the electors of Hackney South at each of the two 1910 general elections; his tactics included recruiting men in boots tipped and heeled with iron, who marched outside his opponent's meetings and rendered the speeches inaudible. In June 1910 he founded the John Bull League, with a mission to promote "commonsense business methods" into government; readers of the magazine could join the League for a shilling (5p) a year. Although still nominally a Liberal, Bottomley had become a trenchant critic of his party, and often aligned himself with the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> opposition in attacking <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">Asquith's</a> government.

Bottomley's parliamentary ambitions were suddenly halted in 1912, when he was successfully sued for £49,000 by one of his Joint Stock Trust victims. Unable to pay, and with massive debts, he was bankrupted with liabilities totalling £233,000. Since bankrupts are ineligible to sit in the House of Commons, he had to resign his seat; after his departure the future <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, <a href="F.%20E.%20Smith%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Birkenhead">F. E. Smith</a>, wrote that "[h]is absence from the House of Commons has impoverished the public stock of gaiety, of cleverness, of common sense". Prior to his bankruptcy, Bottomley had ensured that his main assets were legally owned by relatives or nominees, and was thus able to continue his extravagant lifestyle. "John Bull" remained an ample source of funds, and Bottomley boasted that although nominally bankrupt, "I never had a better time in my life—plenty of money and everything else I want as well".

After leaving the House of Commons, Bottomley denounced parliament in the pages of "John Bull" as a "musty, rusty, corrupt system" that urgently needed replacement. Through his newly formed Business League he addressed large crowds as he called for government run by businessmen not politicians. As always, Bottomley's lifestyle required fresh sources of income, and in 1912 "John Bull" began to organise competitions for cash prizes. Bottomley successfully sued the secretary of the <a href="National%20Anti-Gambling%20League">Anti-Gambling League</a> for suggesting that many of the prizewinners were "John Bull" nominees or employees, but received only a <a href="Farthing%20%28British%20coin%29">farthing</a> in damages. These competitions helped to raise the magazine's circulation to 1.5 million. In 1913 Bottomley met a Birmingham businessman, Reuben Bigland, and together they began running large-scale sweepstakes and lotteries, operated from Switzerland to circumvent English law. Again doubts arose about the genuineness of declared winners; the winner of the £25,000 sweepstake for the 1914 Derby proved on enquiry to be the sister-in-law of one of Bottomley's close associates. Bottomley insisted this was a coincidence; years later, it was revealed that all but £250 of the prize had been paid into a bank account controlled by Bottomley.

Bottomley initially misread the international crisis that developed during the summer of 1914. After the murder of the Austrian <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> on 28 June in <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>, allegedly with Serbian complicity, "John Bull" described Serbia as "a hotbed of cold-blooded conspiracy and subterfuge", and called for it to be wiped from the map of Europe. When Britain declared war on the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> on 4 August, Bottomley quickly reversed his position, and within a fortnight was demanding the elimination of Germany. "John Bull" campaigned relentlessly against the "Germhuns", and against British citizens carrying German-sounding surnames—the danger of "the enemy within" was a persistent Bottomley theme. 

On 14 September 1914 he addressed a large crowd at the <a href="Peacock%20Theatre">London Opera House</a>, the first of many mass meetings at which he deployed his trademark phrase, "the Prince of Peace, (pointing to the Star of Bethlehem) that leads us on to God"—words which according to Symons moved many hearts. At the "Great War Rally" at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> on 14 January 1915, Bottomley was fully in tune with the national temper when he proclaimed: "We are fighting all that is worst in the world, the product of a debased civilisation".

During the war, in his self-appointed role as spokesman for the "man in the street", Bottomley addressed more than 300 public meetings, in all parts of the country. For recruitment rallies he provided his services free; for others, he took a percentage of the takings. His influence was enormous; the writer <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a>, who detested Bottomley, thought that he represented the national spirit and that he might become prime minister. In March 1915 Bottomley began a regular weekly column for the "<a href="Sunday%20Pictorial">Sunday Pictorial</a>". On 4 May, after the <a href="Sinking%20of%20the%20RMS%20Lusitania">sinking of the "Lusitania"</a>, he used this column to label the Germans as "unnatural freaks", and called for their extermination. Britain's war effort, he maintained, was being hampered by squeamish politicians; he reserved particular venom for the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> leaders, <a href="Keir%20Hardie">Keir Hardie</a> and <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a>, who opposed the war, and demanded they be tried for high treason. Macdonald's riposte—to label Bottomley "a man of doubtful parentage who had lived all his life on the threshold of jail"—backfired when the latter published Macdonald's birth certificate which showed that the Labour leader was himself illegitimate.

Although the government was wary of Bottomley it was prepared to make use of his influence and popularity. In April 1915 the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> asked him to speak to shipworkers on the <a href="River%20Clyde">River Clyde</a>, who were threatening industrial action. After Bottomley's intervention the strike was averted. In 1917 he visited the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">front in France</a>, where, after dining with <a href="Field%20Marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Sir Douglas Haig</a>, he was a considerable success with the troops, as he was later when he visited the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. He hoped that these morale-boosting activities would lead to a formal government position, but although from time to time there were rumours of a Cabinet post, no appointment was announced. In the later stages of the war Bottomley was a regular critic of the National War Aims Committee (NWAC), a cross-party parliamentary body formed in 1917 to revitalise Britain's commitment to victory and to underline the justice of its cause. Bottomley described the committee as "a dodge for doctoring public opinion", and in January 1918 told Lloyd George, who had become prime minister in December 1916, that NWAC had failed in its purpose and should be replaced by a Director of Propaganda—but to no avail.

Although in 1912 Bottomley had expressed contempt for parliament, he privately hankered to return. When the war ended in November 1918 and a general election was announced, he knew that to be a candidate in that election he needed a discharge from his bankruptcy. A payment of £34,000 in cash and bonds, and some hasty reorganisation of outstanding debts, was sufficient for an acquiescent Official Receiver to grant the discharge just in time for Bottomley to hand in his nomination papers in Hackney South. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201918">general election on 14 December 1918</a> he stood as an Independent, under the slogan "Bottomley, Brains and Business", and achieved a massive victory, with almost 80 per cent of the votes cast. "I am now prepared to proceed to Westminster to run the show", he informed a local newspaper. He would be, he said, the "unofficial prime minister ... watching the government's every move" to ensure that it acted in the interests of "our soldiers, sailors and citizens".

The 1918 parliament was dominated by <a href="Lloyd%20George%20ministry">Lloyd George's Liberal–Conservative coalition</a>, which faced a fragmented and unorganised opposition. In May 1919 Bottomley announced the formation of his "People's League", which he hoped would develop into a fully-fledged political party with a programme opposing both organised labour and organised capital. No mass movement emerged, but Bottomley joined with other Independent MPs to form the <a href="Independent%20Parliamentary%20Group">Independent Parliamentary Group</a>, with a distinct policy stance including the enforcement of war reparations, the superiority of Britain over the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>, exclusion of undesirable aliens, and "the introduction of business principles into government". The group was reinforced through by-election victories of other Independents—including <a href="Charles%20Frederick%20Palmer">Charles Frederick Palmer</a>, "John Bull"s deputy editor, until his premature death in October 1920. Bottomley was, at least for a year or so, a diligent parliamentarian who spoke on a range of issues, and from time to time teased the government as when, during the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish Troubles</a>, he asked whether, "in view of the breakdown of British rule in Ireland, the government will approach America with a view to her accepting the mandate for the government of that country". On other occasions he helped the government, as when in January 1919, he was called upon in his role of "Soldier's Friend" to help pacify troops in <a href="Folkestone">Folkestone</a> and <a href="Calais">Calais</a> who were in a state of mutiny over delays in their demobilisation.

In July 1919 Bottomley announced his "Victory Bonds Club", based on the government's latest issue of <a href="War%20Bond">Victory Bonds</a>. Normally, these bonds cost £5; in Bottomley's club, subscribers bought units for a minimum payment of £1, and participated in an annual draw for prizes—up to £20,000, he said—funded from accrued interest. Contrary to Bottomley's public statements, not all the money subscribed was used to buy bonds. He had ambitions to become a press baron, to rival such as the Lords <a href="Viscount%20Rothermere">Rothermere</a> and <a href="Max%20Aitken%2C%20Lord%20Beaverbrook">Beaverbrook</a>. 

In October 1919 he used War Bonds funds to buy two obscure newspapers, the "National News" and the "Sunday Evening Telegram". The papers were not financially successful, and in 1921 Bottomley closed the "Telegram" and changed the name of the "National News" to "Sunday Illustrated". To bolster its fortunes, he transferred his "Sunday Pictorial" column to the "Illustrated", and mounted an expensive promotional campaign, but with little benefit. The paper languished, while Bottomley lost the large income and readership that went with the "Pictorial". His fortunes declined further when, in 1920, Odhams revoked the pre-war partnership agreement and took full control of "John Bull". Bottomley was made editor for life, but a year later Odhams terminated this arrangement with a final pay-off of £25,000, which ended Bottomley's connection with the paper.

Meanwhile, dogged by poor administration and inadequate accounting, the Victory Bonds Club was sliding into chaos. Public unease grew, and soon hundreds of subscribers were demanding their money back—slipshod record-keeping meant that some were repaid several times over. Bottomley's position worsened when he fell out with Bigland, after refusing to finance his former associate's scheme for turning water into petrol. The two had quarrelled during the war, when Bigland had attacked Bottomley in print. They had later reconciled, but after their second dispute Bigland turned vengeful. In September 1921 he published a leaflet describing the War Bond Club as Bottomley's "latest and greatest swindle". Against the advice of his lawyers, Bottomley sued for criminal libel, and brought other charges against Bigland of blackmail and extortion. The preliminary hearing, at <a href="Bow%20Street%20Magistrates%27%20Court">Bow Street Magistrates' Court</a> in October 1921, at which Bottomley's methods were revealed, proved disastrous to his credibility. Nevertheless, Bigland was committed for trial at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a> on the libel charge, and to Shropshire Assizes on charges of attempted extortion. The libel trial began on 23 January 1922; to prevent further damaging disclosures in court, Bottomley's lawyers offered no evidence, and Bigland was discharged. The extortion case went ahead in <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> on 18 February 1922, at the end of which it took the jury only three minutes to find Bigland not guilty. Bottomley, himself now under police investigation, was ordered to pay the costs of the trial. A few days afterwards, he was summoned to appear at Bow Street, on charges of fraudulent conversion of Victory Bond Club funds. After a brief hearing he was committed for trial at the Old Bailey.

Bottomley's trial began on 19 May 1922, before <a href="Arthur%20Salter%20%28judge%29">Mr Justice Salter</a>. As the case was beginning, Bottomley secured the agreement of the prosecuting counsel, <a href="Travers%20Humphreys">Travers Humphreys</a>, to a 15-minute adjournment each day so that he, Bottomley, could drink a pint of champagne, ostensibly for medicinal purposes. He faced 24 fraud charges, involving amounts totalling £170,000. The prosecution produced evidence that he had regularly used Victory Bonds Club funds to finance business ventures, private debts and his expensive lifestyle. 

Bottomley, who defended himself, claimed that his legitimate expenses in connection with the club, and repayments made to Victory Bonds Club members, exceeded total receipts by at least £50,000: "I swear I have never made a penny out of it. I swear before God that I have never fraudulently converted a penny of the Club's money". The weight of evidence suggested otherwise; Salter's summing up, described by a biographer as "masterly; lucid and concise, yet complete", went heavily against Bottomley, and the jury required only 28 minutes to convict him on all but one of the charges. He was sentenced to seven years' <a href="Penal%20labour">penal servitude</a>. Humphreys commented later: "It was not I that floored him, but Drink".

After the dismissal of his appeal in July, Bottomley was expelled from the House of Commons. The <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons">Leader of the House</a>, <a href="Sir%20Austen%20Chamberlain">Sir Austen Chamberlain</a>, read out a letter in which Bottomley insisted that, however unorthodox his methods, he had not been guilty of conscious fraud; he accepted that his predicament was entirely his own fault. Chamberlain then moved Bottomley's expulsion, which was carried without dissent. One member expressed regret, "remembering the remarkable position which he [had] occupied in the country". Bottomley spent the first year of his sentence in <a href="HM%20Prison%20Wormwood%20Scrubs">Wormwood Scrubs</a> where he sewed mailbags, and the remainder in <a href="HM%20Prison%20Maidstone">Maidstone Prison</a> where, although conditions were squalid, he was given lighter work. He was released on 29 July 1927, after serving just over five years, and returned to The Dicker, still his family home.

Although now 67 years old and in indifferent health, Bottomley tried to resurrect his business career. He raised sufficient capital to start a new magazine, "John Blunt", as a rival to "John Bull", but the new venture lasted little more than a year before closing, having lost money from the start. In September 1929 he began an overseas lecture tour, which failed utterly, as did an attempt at a British tour during which he was received with indifference or hostility. By 1930 he was again bankrupt; his wife Eliza died that year, after which Bottomley's former son-in-law Jefferson Cohn evicted him from The Dicker. For the remaining years of his life he lived with his long-time mistress, the actress Peggy Primrose, whom Bottomley, in his years of riches, had vainly tried to promote to stardom.

Bottomley's last public venture was an engagement at the <a href="Windmill%20Theatre">Windmill Theatre</a> in September 1932, where he performed a monologue of reminiscences that, according to Symons, puzzled rather than amused his audience. Following a health breakdown, he lived with Primrose in quiet poverty until his final illness.

Bottomley died at the <a href="Middlesex%20Hospital">Middlesex Hospital</a> on 26 May 1933 at the age of 73, and his body was cremated at <a href="Golders%20Green%20Crematorium">Golders Green Crematorium</a> a few days later. A large crowd heard the Revd Basil Bourchier express the hope that "no one here today will forget what Mr Bottomley did to revive the spirits of our men at the Front". Four years later, in accordance with Bottomley's wishes, Primrose scattered his ashes on the <a href="South%20Downs">Sussex Downs</a>.

Bottomley's obituaries dwelt on the common theme of wasted talent: a man of brilliant natural abilities, destroyed by greed and vanity. "He had personal magnetism, eloquence, and the power to convince", wrote his "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" obituarist. "He might have been a leader at the Bar, a captain of industry, a great journalist. He might have been almost anything". "<a href="The%20Straits%20Times">The Straits Times</a>" of Singapore thought that Bottomley could have rivalled Lloyd George as a national leader: "Though he deserved his fate, the news of his passing will awaken the many regrets for the good which he did when he was Bottomley the reformer and crusader and the champion of the bottom dog". A later historian, <a href="Maurice%20Cowling">Maurice Cowling</a>, pays tribute to Bottomley's capacity and industry, and to his forceful campaigns in support of liberty. In his sketch for the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>", Morris delivers a different judgement: "[H]e claimed to serve the interests of others, but sought only his own gratification".

Among Bottomley's principal biographers, Hyman suggests that his financial fecklessness and disregard for consequences may have originated from his deprived background and sudden acquisition of wealth in the 1890s. "Success went to his head and he started spending money like a drunken sailor and could never break the habit." It was a wonder, says Hyman, that he stayed out of prison as long as he did. <a href="G.%20R.%20Searle">G. R. Searle</a> speculates that Bottomley was protected from prosecution because of his knowledge of wider scandals in the government, particularly after Lloyd George's coalition assumed power in 1916. Symons acknowledges Bottomley's "wonderfully rich public personality" but suggests that there was no substance behind the presentation: throughout his adult life, Bottomley was "more a series of public attitudes than a person". <a href="Matthew%20Engel">Matthew Engel</a> in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" notes his ability to charm the public even while swindling them; one victim, cheated of £40,000, apparently insisted: "I am not sorry I lent him the money, and I would do it again". If London had had a mayor in those days, says Engel, Bottomley would have won in a landslide.

Horse-fly

Horse-flies or horseflies (for other names, see <a href="Horse-fly%23Common%20names">common names</a>) are true <a href="Fly">flies</a> in the family Tabanidae in the <a href="insect">insect</a> <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="Diptera">Diptera</a>. They are often large and agile in flight, and the females bite animals, including humans, to obtain blood. They prefer to fly in sunlight, avoiding dark and shady areas, and are inactive at night. They are found all over the world except for some islands and the polar regions (Hawaii, Greenland, Iceland). Both horse-flies and <a href="Botfly">botflies</a> (Oestridae) are sometimes referred to as gadflies.

Adult horse-flies feed on nectar and plant exudates; the males have weak <a href="insect%20mouthparts">mouthparts</a> and only the females bite animals to obtain enough <a href="protein">protein</a> from blood to produce <a href="egg">egg</a>s. The mouthparts of females are formed into a stout stabbing organ with two pairs of sharp cutting blades, and a spongelike part used to lap up the blood that flows from the wound. The larvae are predaceous and grow in semiaquatic habitats.

Female horse-flies can <a href="vector%20%28epidemiology%29">transfer</a> <a href="blood-borne%20disease">blood-borne disease</a>s from one animal to another through their feeding habit. In areas where diseases occur, they have been known to carry <a href="equine%20infectious%20anemia">equine infectious anaemia virus</a>, some <a href="Trypanosoma">trypanosomes</a>, the <a href="filariasis">filarial worm</a> "<a href="Loa%20loa">Loa loa</a>", <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> among cattle and sheep, and <a href="tularemia">tularemia</a>. They can reduce growth rates in cattle and lower the milk output of cows if suitable shelters are not provided.

Horse-flies have appeared in literature since <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> in <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a> mentioned them driving people to madness through their persistent pursuit. <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> uses the theme of the maddening gadfly in his plays "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>" and "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>".

Apart from the common name "horse-flies", broad categories of biting, bloodsucking Tabanidae are known by a large number of common names. The word "Tabanus" was first recorded by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Younger">Pliny the Younger</a> and has survived as the generic name. In general, country-folk did not distinguish between the various biting insects that irritated their cattle and called them all "gad-flies", from the word "gad" meaning a spike. The most common name is "cleg[g]", "gleg" or "clag", which comes from <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> and may have originated from the <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a>. Other names such as "stouts" refer to the wide bodies of the insects and "dun-flies" to their sombre colouring. "Chrysops" species are known as "deer-flies", perhaps because of their abundance on moorland where <a href="Red%20deer">deer</a> roam, and "buffalo-flies", "moose-flies" and "elephant-flies" emanate from other parts of the world where these animals are found. In North America they are known as "breeze-flies", and in Australia some are known as "March flies", a name used in other Anglophonic countries to refer to the non-bloodsucking <a href="Bibionidae">Bibionidae</a>.

Adult tabanids are large flies with prominent <a href="Eye%23Compound%20eyes">compound eyes</a>, short <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a> composed of three segments, and wide bodies. In females, the eyes are widely separated but in males they are almost touching; they are often patterned and brightly coloured in life but appear dull in preserved specimens. The terminal segment of the antennae is pointed and is annulated, appearing to be made up of several tapering rings. There are no hairs or <a href="Arista%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">arista</a> arising from the antennae. Both head and thorax are clad in short hairs, but no bristles are on the body. The membranous forewings are clear, uniformly shaded grey or brown, or patterned in some species; they have a basal lobe (or calypter) that covers the modified knob-like hindwings or <a href="halteres">halteres</a>. The tips of the legs have two lobes on the sides (pulvilli) and a central lobe or empodium in addition to two claws that enable them to grip surfaces. Species recognition is based on details of head structures (antennae, <a href="Insect%20morphology%23Head">frons</a>, and <a href="Maxilla%20%28arthropod%20mouthpart%29">maxillae</a>), the wing venation and the body patterning; minute variations of surface structure cause subtle alterations of the overlying hairs which alters the appearance of the body.

Tabanid species range from medium-sized to very large, robust insects. Most have a body length between , with the largest having a wingspan of . Deer flies in the genus "<a href="Deer%20fly">Chrysops</a>" are up to long, have yellow to black bodies and striped abdomens, and membranous wings with dark patches. Horse-flies (genus "<a href="Tabanus">Tabanus</a>") are larger, up to in length and are mostly dark brown or black, with dark eyes, often with a metallic sheen. Yellow flies (genus "<a href="Diachlorus">Diachlorus</a>") are similar in shape to deer flies, but have yellowish bodies and the eyes are purplish-black with a green sheen. Some species in the subfamily Pangoniinae have an exceptionally long <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a> (tubular mouthpart).

The larvae are long and cylindrical with small heads and 12 body segments. They have rings of <a href="Tubercle%20%28anatomy%29">tubercle</a>s (warty outgrowths) known as pseudopods around the segments, and also bands of short <a href="seta">seta</a>e (bristles). The posterior tip of each <a href="larva">larva</a> has a breathing siphon and a bulbous area known as Graber's organ. The outlines of the adult insect's head and wings are visible through the <a href="pupa">pupa</a>, which has seven moveable abdominal segments, all except the front one of which bears a band of setae. The posterior end of the pupa bears a group of spine-like tubercles.

Some species, such as deer flies and the Australian March flies, are known for being extremely noisy during flight, though clegs, for example, fly quietly and bite with little warning. Tabanids are agile fliers; "<a href="Hybomitra">Hybomitra</a>" species have been observed to perform aerial manoeuvres similar to those performed by fighter jets, such as the <a href="Immelmann%20turn">Immelmann turn</a>. Horseflies can lay claim to being the fastest flying insects; the male "Hybomitra hinei wrighti" has been recorded reaching speeds of up to per hour when pursuing a female.

Horse-flies are found worldwide, except for the polar regions, but they are absent from some islands such as <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>, <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, and <a href="Hawaii%20%28island%29">Hawaii</a>. The genera "Tabanus", "Chrysops", and "Haematopota" all occur in temperate, subtropical, and tropical locations, but "Haematopota" is absent from Australia and South America. Horse-flies mostly occur in warm areas with suitable moist locations for breeding, but also occupy a wide range of habitats from deserts to alpine meadows. They are found from sea level to at least .

The first record of a tabanid comes from the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a> of China, and specimens from the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> have been found in England, Spain, and possibly South Africa. In the New World, the first discoveries date from the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> of <a href="Florissant%2C%20Colorado">Florissant, Colorado</a>. These insects are recognisable as tabanids both from their mouthparts and their wing venation. Although the bloodsucking habit is associated with a long proboscis, a fossil insect that has elongated mouthparts is not necessarily a bloodsucker, as it may instead have fed on nectar. The ancestral tabanids may have co-evolved with the angiosperm plants on which they fed. With a necessity for high-protein food for egg production, the diet of early tabanomorphs was probably predatory, and from this the bloodsucking habit may have evolved. In the <a href="Santana%20Formation">Santana Formation</a> in Brazil, no mammals have been found, so the fossil tabanids found there likely fed on reptiles. Cold bloodsucking probably preceded warm bloodsucking, but some <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s are postulated to have been warm-blooded and may have been early hosts for the horse-flies.

The Tabanidae are <a href="Fly">true flies</a> and members of the <a href="insect">insect</a> <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> Diptera. With the families <a href="Athericidae">Athericidae</a>, <a href="Pelecorhynchidae">Pelecorhynchidae</a> and <a href="Oreoleptidae">Oreoleptidae</a>, Tabanidae are classified in the <a href="Taxonomic%20rank%23Ranks%20in%20zoology">superfamily</a> <a href="Tabanoidea">Tabanoidea</a>. Along with the Rhagionoidea, this superfamily makes up the infraorder <a href="Tabanomorpha">Tabanomorpha</a>. Tabanoid families seem to be united by the presence of a venom canal in the mandible of the larvae. Worldwide, about 4,455 species of Tabanidae have been <a href="Species%20description">described</a>, over 1,300 of them in the genus "<a href="Tabanus">Tabanus</a>".

Tabanid identification is based mostly on adult <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characters of the head, wing venation, and sometimes the last abdominal segment. The genitalia are very simple and do not provide clear species differentiation as in many other insect groups. In the past, most taxonomic treatments considered the family to be composed of three subfamilies: Pangoniinae (tribes Pangoniini, Philolichini, Scionini), Chrysopsinae (tribes Bouvieromyiini, Chrysopsini, Rhinomyzini), and Tabaninae (tribes Diachlorini, Haematopotini, Tabanini). Some treatments increased this to five subfamilies, adding the subfamily Adersiinae, with the single genus "<a href="Adersia">Adersia</a>", and the subfamily Scepcidinae, with the two genera "<a href="Braunsiomyia">Braunsiomyia</a>" and "<a href="Scepsis%20%28genus%29">Scepsis</a>".

A 2015 study by Morita et al. using <a href="Nucleic%20acid%20sequence">nucleotide data</a>, aimed to clarify the <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> of the Tabanidae and supports three subfamilies. The subfamilies Pangoniinae and Tabaninae were shown to be <a href="Monophyly">monophyletic</a>. The tribes Philolichini, Chrysopsini, Rhinomyzini, and Haematopotini were found to be monophyletic, with the Scionini also being monophyletic apart from the difficult-to-place genus "Goniops". "Adersia" was recovered within the Pangoniini as were the genera previously placed in the Scepcidinae, and "Mycteromyia" and "Goniops" were recovered within the Chrysopsini.


The Tabaninae lack <a href="Simple%20eye%20in%20invertebrates">ocelli</a> (simple eyes) and have no spurs on the tips of their hind <a href="tibia">tibia</a>e. In the Pangoniinae, ocelli are present and the antennal <a href="flagellum">flagellum</a> (whip-like structure) usually has eight annuli (or rings). In the Chrysopsinae, the antennal flagellum has a basal plate and the flagellum has four annuli. Females have a shining callus on the frons (front of the head between the eyes). The Adersiinae have a divided tergite on the ninth abdominal segment, and the Scepsidinae have highly reduced mouthparts. Members of the family <a href="Pelecorhynchidae">Pelecorhynchidae</a> were initially included in the Tabanidae and moved into the <a href="Rhagionidae">Rhagionidae</a> before being elevated into a separate family. The <a href="infraorder">infraorder</a> <a href="Tabanomorpha">Tabanomorpha</a> shares the blood-feeding habit as a common primitive characteristic, although this is restricted to the female.

Two well-known genera are the common horse-flies, "Tabanus", named by Swedish <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomist</a> <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1758, and the deer flies, "Chrysops", named by the German <a href="Entomology">entomologist</a> <a href="Johann%20Wilhelm%20Meigen">Johann Wilhelm Meigen</a> in 1802. Meigen did pioneering research on flies and was the author of "Die Fliegen" (The Flies); he gave the name "<a href="Haematopota">Haematopota</a>", blood-drinker, to another common genus of horse-flies.

Adult horse-flies feed on nectar and plant <a href="exudate">exudate</a>s, and some are important <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a>s of certain specialised flowers; several South African and Asian species in the Pangoniinae have spectacularly long probosces adapted for the extraction of nectar from flowers with long, narrow <a href="petal">corolla</a> tubes, such as "<a href="Lapeirousia">Lapeirousia</a>", and certain "<a href="Pelargonium">Pelargonium</a>".

Both males and females engage in nectar feeding, but in addition to this, females of most species are <a href="Anautogeny">anautogenous</a>, meaning they require a blood meal before they are able to reproduce effectively. To obtain the blood, the females, but not the males, bite animals, including humans. The female needs about six days to fully digest her blood meal and after that, she needs to find another host. The flies seem to be attracted to a potential victim by its movement, warmth, and surface texture, and by the <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> it breathes out. The flies mainly choose large mammals such as cattle, horses, camels, and deer, but few are species-specific. They have also been observed feeding on smaller mammals, birds, lizards, and turtles, and even on animals that have recently died. Unlike many biting insects such as <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es, whose biting mechanism and saliva allow a bite not noticed by the host at the time, horse-fly bites are immediately irritating to the victim, so that they are often brushed off, and may have to visit multiple hosts to obtain sufficient blood. This behaviour means that they may carry disease-causing organisms from one host to another. The large animals and livestock mostly bitten by horse-flies are generally powerless to dislodge the fly, so there is no selective advantage for the flies to evolve a less immediately painful bite.
The mouthparts of females are of the usual dipteran form and consist of a bundle of six <a href="chitin">chitin</a>ous stylets that, together with a fold of the fleshy <a href="Labium%20%28arthropod%20mouthpart%29">labium</a>, form the <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a>. On either side of these are two maxillary palps. When the insect lands on an animal, it grips the surface with its clawed feet, the labium is retracted, the head is thrust downwards and the stylets slice into the flesh. Some of these have sawing edges and muscles can move them from side-to-side to enlarge the wound. <a href="Saliva">Saliva</a> containing <a href="anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a> is injected into the wound to prevent clotting. The blood that flows from the wound is lapped up by another mouthpart which functions as a sponge. Horse-fly bites can be painful for a day or more; fly saliva may provoke allergic reactions such as hives and difficulty with breathing. Tabanid bites can make life outdoors unpleasant for humans, and can reduce milk output in cattle. They are attracted by reflections from water which are polarized, making them a particular nuisance near swimming pools. Since tabanids prefer to be in sunshine, they normally avoid shaded places such as barns, and are inactive at night.

Attack patterns vary with species; clegs fly silently and prefer to bite humans on the wrist or bare leg; large species of "Tabanus" buzz loudly, fly low, and bite ankles, legs, or backs of knees; "Chrysops" flies somewhat higher, bites the back of the neck, and has a high buzzing note. The striped hides of <a href="zebra">zebra</a>s may have evolved to reduce their attractiveness to horse-flies and <a href="Tsetse%20fly">tsetse flies</a> than either plain dark or plain white hides. The closer together the stripes, the fewer flies are visually attracted; the zebra's legs have particularly fine striping, and this is the shaded part of the body that is most likely to be bitten in other, unstriped equids.
This does not preclude the possible use of stripes for other purposes such as <a href="signaling%20theory">signaling</a> or <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a>.

The eggs of horse-flies are often attacked by tiny <a href="Parasitoid%20wasp">parasitic wasp</a>s, and the larvae are consumed by birds, as well as being paratised by <a href="Tachinidae">tachinid flies</a>, fungi, and <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s. Adult horse-flies are eaten by generalized predators such as birds, and some specialist predators, such as the <a href="horse%20guard%20wasp">horse guard wasp</a> (a <a href="Bembicini">bembicinid wasp</a>), also preferentially attack horse-flies, catching them to <a href="mass%20provisioning">provision their nests</a>.

Mating often occurs in swarms, generally at landmarks such as <a href="Hill-topping%20%28biology%29">hilltops</a>. The season, time of day, and type of landmark used for mating swarms are specific to particular species.
<a href="Egg">Egg</a>s are laid on stones or vegetation near water, in clusters of up to 1000, especially on emergent water plants. The eggs are white at first, but darken with age. They hatch after about six days, with the emerging larvae using a special hatching spike to open the egg case. The <a href="larva">larva</a>e fall into the water or onto the moist ground below. "Chrysops" species develop in particularly wet locations, while "Tabanus" species prefer drier places. The larvae are legless grubs, tapering at both ends. They have small heads and 11 or 13 segments, and moult six to 13 times over the course of a year or more. In temperate species, the larvae have a quiescent period during winter (diapause), while tropical species breed several times a year. In the majority of species, they are white, but in some, they are greenish or brownish, and they often have dark bands on each segment. A respiratory siphon at the hind end allows the larvae to obtain air when submerged in water. Larvae of nearly all species are <a href="Carnivore">carnivorous</a>, often cannibalistic in captivity, and consume <a href="worm">worm</a>s, insect larvae, and <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s. The larvae may be parasitized by nematodes, flies of the families Bombyliidae and Tachinidae, and Hymenoptera in the family <a href="Pteromalidae">Pteromalidae</a>. When fully developed, the larvae move into drier soil near the surface of the ground to <a href="pupa">pupa</a>te.

The pupae are brown and glossy, rounded at the head end, and tapering at the other end. Wing and limb buds can be seen and each abdominal segment is fringed with short spines. After about two weeks, <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> is complete, the pupal case splits along the thorax, and the adult fly emerges. Males usually appear first, but when both sexes have emerged, mating takes place, courtship starting in the air and finishing on the ground. The female needs to feed on blood before depositing her egg mass.

Tabanids are known <a href="vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vectors</a> for some <a href="blood-borne%20disease">blood-borne</a> bacterial, viral, <a href="Protozoan%20infection">protozoan</a>, and <a href="Helminths">worm</a> diseases of mammals, such as the <a href="equine%20infectious%20anemia">equine infectious anaemia virus</a> and various species of "<a href="Trypanosoma">Trypanosoma</a>" which cause diseases in animals and humans. Species of the genus "<a href="Chrysops">Chrysops</a>" transmit the <a href="parasitism">parasitic</a> <a href="filariasis">filarial worm</a> "<a href="Loa%20loa">Loa loa</a>" between humans, and tabanids are known to transmit <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> among cattle and sheep, and <a href="tularemia">tularemia</a> between <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s and humans.

Blood loss is a common problem in some animals when large flies are abundant. Some animals have been known to lose up to of blood in a single day to tabanid flies, a loss which can weaken or even kill them. Anecdotal reports of horse-fly bites leading to fatal <a href="anaphylaxis">anaphylaxis</a> in humans have been made, an extremely rare occurrence.

Controlling horse-flies is difficult. <a href="Malaise%20trap">Malaise trap</a>s are most often used to capture them, and these can be modified with the use of baits and attractants that include carbon dioxide or <a href="octenol">octenol</a>. A dark shiny ball suspended below them that moves in the breeze can also attract them and forms a key part of a modified "Manitoba trap" that is used most often for trapping and sampling the Tabanidae. Cattle can be treated with pour-on <a href="pyrethroid">pyrethroid</a>s which may repel the flies, and fitting them with insecticide-impregnated eartags or collars has had some success in killing the insects.

Humans find horse-fly bites painful. Usually, a weal (raised area of skin) occurs around the site, and other symptoms may include <a href="urticaria">urticaria</a> (a rash), dizziness, weakness, wheezing, and <a href="angioedema">angioedema</a> (a temporary itchy, pink or red swelling occurring around the eyes or lips); a few people experience an allergic reaction. The site of the bite should be washed and a cold compress applied. Scratching the wound should be avoided and an <a href="antihistamine">antihistamine</a> preparation can be applied. In most cases, the symptoms subside within a few hours, but if the wound becomes infected, medical advice should be sought.

In "<a href="Prometheus%20Bound">Prometheus Bound</a>", which is attributed to the Athenian tragic playwright <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>, a <a href="Gadfly%20%28mythology%29">gadfly</a> sent by <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>'s wife <a href="Hera">Hera</a> pursues and torments his mistress <a href="Io%20%28mythology%29">Io</a>, who has been transformed into a cow and is watched constantly by the hundred eyes of the herdsman <a href="Argus%20Panoptes">Argus</a>: "Io: Ah! Hah! Again the prick, the stab of gadfly-sting! O earth, earth, hide, the hollow shape—Argus—that evil thing—the hundred-eyed." <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, inspired by Aeschylus, has <a href="Tom%20o%27Bedlam">Tom o'Bedlam</a> in "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>", "Whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire", driven mad by the constant pursuit. In "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", Shakespeare likens Cleopatra's hasty departure from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Actium battlefield</a> to that of a cow chased by a gadfly: "The breeze [gadfly] upon her, like a cow in June / hoists sail and flies", where "June" may allude not only to the month but also to the goddess <a href="Juno%20%28mythology%29">Juno</a>, who torments Io, and the cow in turn may allude to Io, who is changed into a cow in <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>".

The physician and naturalist <a href="Thomas%20Muffet">Thomas Muffet</a> wrote that the horse-fly "carries before him a very hard, stiff, and well-compacted sting, with which he strikes through the Oxe his hide; he is in fashion like a great Fly, and forces the beasts for fear of him only to stand up to the belly in water, or else to betake themselves to wood sides, cool shades, and places where the wind blowes through." The "<a href="Jimmy%20Crack%20Corn">Blue Tail Fly</a>" in the eponymous song was probably the mourning horsefly ("<a href="Tabanus%20atratus">Tabanus atratus</a>"), a tabanid with a blue-black abdomen common to the southeastern United States.

HMS Furious (47)

HMS "Furious" was a modified built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> (RN) during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. Designed to support the <a href="Baltic%20Project">Baltic Project</a> championed by the <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a> of the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>, <a href="John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher">Lord Fisher</a>, the ship was very lightly armoured and designed to be armed with only two heavy guns (18-inch), one forward and one aft, plus a number of lesser guns. "Furious" was modified and became an <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> while under construction. Her forward turret was removed and a <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> was added in its place, such that aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure to land. Later in the war, the ship had her rear turret removed and a second flight deck installed aft of the superstructure, but this was less than satisfactory due to air <a href="turbulence">turbulence</a>. "Furious" was briefly laid up after the war before she was reconstructed with a full-length flight deck in the early 1920s.

After her conversion, "Furious" was used extensively for trials of naval aircraft and later as a training carrier once the new armoured carriers like entered service in the late 1930s. During the early months of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> the carrier spent her time hunting for German raiders in the North Atlantic and escorting convoys. This changed dramatically during the <a href="Norwegian%20Campaign">Norwegian Campaign</a> in early 1940 when her aircraft provided air support to British troops ashore in addition to attacking German shipping. The first of what would be a large number of aircraft ferry missions was made by the carrier during the campaign. After the withdrawal of British troops in May, "Furious" made several anti-shipping strikes in Norway with little result before beginning a steady routine of ferrying aircraft for the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>.

At first "Furious" made several trips to <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>, but she began to ferry aircraft to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> in 1941. An unsuccessful attack on German-occupied ports on the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> interrupted the ferry missions in mid-1941. "Furious" was given a lengthy refit in the United States and spent a few months training after her return in April 1942. She made several more ferry trips in mid-1942 before her aircraft attacked airfields in <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a> <a href="French%20Algeria">Algeria</a> as part of the opening stages of <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a> in November 1942. The ship remained in the Mediterranean until February 1943 when she was transferred to the Home Fleet.

"Furious" spent most of 1943 training, but made a number of attacks on the and other targets in Norway during the first half of 1944. By September 1944, the ship was showing her age and she was placed in <a href="Reserve%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">reserve</a>. "Furious" was decommissioned in April 1945, but was not sold for <a href="scrap">scrap</a> until 1948.

During the First World War, <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> Fisher was prevented from ordering an improved version of the preceding s by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers. To obtain ships suitable for traditional battlecruiser roles, such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders, he settled on ships with the minimal armour of a <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> and the armament of a battlecruiser. He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his <a href="Baltic%20Project">Baltic Project</a>, a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast.

"Furious" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a beam of , and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. She displaced normally and at deep load. She had a metacentric height of at deep load. "Furious" and her <a href="sister%20ship">half-sisters</a> were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s. To save design time the installation used in the light cruiser , the first cruiser in the RN with geared turbines, was copied and simply duplicated to provide two sets of turbines. The four Brown-Curtis turbines were powered by eighteen <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders">Yarrow</a> small-tube <a href="water-tube%20boiler">boilers</a> that were designed to produce a total of . The ship's speed was an estimated , but she never ran her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s.

"Furious" was designed to normally carry of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, but could carry a maximum of . At full capacity, she could steam for an estimated at a speed of . The ship was designed to carry two <a href="BL%2018%20inch%20Mk%20I%20naval%20gun">BL 18-inch Mark I</a> guns in two single turrets, one each fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her secondary armament consisted of 11 <a href="BL%205.5%20inch%20Mark%20I%20naval%20gun">BL 5.5-inch Mk I</a> guns. A pair of <a href="QF%203-inch%2020%20cwt">QF 3-inch (76 mm) 20 cwt</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> guns were mounted before the <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a>. "Furious" also mounted two submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">tubes</a> for <a href="British%2021%20inch%20torpedo">21-inch torpedoes</a> and 10 torpedoes were carried.

Even as she was being built, "Furious" was modified with a large <a href="hangar">hangar</a> capable of housing ten aircraft on her <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> that replaced the forward turret. A 160-foot (49 m) <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> was built along its roof. Aircraft were flown off and, rather less successfully, landed on this deck. <a href="Floatplane">Floatplane</a>s like the <a href="Short%20Type%20184">Short Type 184</a> used a four-wheel trolley that ran down a track along the centre of the flight deck for take-off. Aircraft were lifted by <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> from the hangar to the flight deck. Although the aft turret was fitted and the gun tested, it was not long before "Furious" returned to her builders for further modifications. In November 1917, the rear turret was replaced by a 300-foot (91 m) deck for landing aircraft over another hangar. Her funnel and superstructure remained intact, with a narrow strip of decking around them to connect the fore and aft flight decks. <a href="Turbulence">Turbulence</a> from the funnel and superstructure was severe enough that only three landing attempts were successful before further attempts were forbidden. Her 18-inch guns were reused on s and during the war.

"Furious" was <a href="Keel">laid down</a> on 8 June 1915 at <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a>'s Low Walker shipyard in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>. The ship was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 18 August 1916 and commissioned on 26 June 1917. As completed, her complement numbered 737 officers and enlisted men.

On 2 August 1917, while performing trials, <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service%23Officer%20ranks">Squadron Commander</a> <a href="Edwin%20Harris%20Dunning">Edwin Dunning</a> landed a <a href="Sopwith%20Pup">Sopwith Pup</a>, believed to have been "<a href="United%20Kingdom%20military%20aircraft%20serials">N6453</a>", successfully on board "Furious", becoming the first person to land an aircraft on a moving ship. On 7 August, he made one more successful landing in the same manner, but on his third attempt, in Pup "N6452", the engine choked and the aircraft crashed off the starboard bow, killing him. The deck arrangement was unsatisfactory because aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure to land.

In the meantime, all three "Courageous"-class ships were assigned to the <a href="1st%20Cruiser%20Squadron">1st Cruiser Squadron</a> (CS) in October 1917 when the Admiralty received word of German ship movements on 16 October, possibly indicating a raid. Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">Beatty</a>, commander of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships. "Furious" was detached from the 1st CS and ordered to sweep along the 56th parallel as far as 4° East and to return before dark. Her half-sisters and were not initially ordered to sea, but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> later that day. Two German light cruisers managed to slip through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed the Scandinavia convoy during the morning of 17 October, but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon. The 1st CS was ordered to attempt to intercept the German ships, but they proved to be faster than expected and the British ships were unsuccessful.

"Furious" returned to the dockyard in November to have the aft turret removed and replaced by another deck for landing, giving her both a launching and a recovery deck. Two lifts (elevators) serving the hangars were also installed. "Furious" was recommissioned on 15 March 1918, and her embarked aircraft were used on anti-<a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> patrols in the North Sea after May. In July 1918, she flew off seven <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a>s which participated in the <a href="Tondern%20raid">Tondern raid</a>, attacking the Zeppelin sheds there with moderate success.

"Furious" was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier with a continuous flight deck between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on experience gained with the first two British carriers, and , although this was very limited as "Argus" was less than three years old and "Eagle" had carried out only 143 deck landings during her preliminary sea trials in 1920.

The ship's superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at that time. The fore-and-aft <a href="arresting%20gear">arresting gear</a> was not intended to stop landing aircraft—the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind—but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the <a href="National%20Physical%20Laboratory%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Physical Laboratory</a> which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges used minimised turbulence.
"Furious" was not lengthened, but her beam was increased to and her average draught was now at deep load, deeper than before the conversion. She displaced at normal load and at deep load, over 3000 long tons more than her previous displacement. Her metacentric height was at deep load, a reduction of after her conversion. During the ship's post-conversion sea trials she reached . Her fuel capacity was increased by during her reconstruction, which increased her range to at a speed of or at a speed of .

A two-level hangar was built under the flight deck, in height per level. The lower hangar was long by wide and the upper was . Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> which improved <a href="launch%20and%20recovery%20cycle">launch and recovery cycle</a> flexibility allowing the ship to simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck or to speedily fly off her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck. Like "Argus", "Furious" was <a href="flush%20deck">flush-decked</a> and lacked an island <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> to minimise any turbulence over the flight deck; instead she had a navigating position at the leading edge of the flight deck, starboard, and was provided with a retractable <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23C">charthouse</a> forward, on the flight deck centreline. The ship could normally carry about 36 aircraft.

Two lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. No arresting gear was fitted and two ready-use <a href="petrol">petrol</a> tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional of petrol were in bulk storage. In 1939, her complement consisted of 41 officers and 754 crewmen.

"Furious" retained ten of her original eleven <a href="breech-loading">breech-loading</a> guns, five on each side, for self-defence from enemy warships. Six <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20V%20naval%20gun">QF 4-inch Mark V</a> guns replaced her original anti-aircraft guns. Four were mounted on the sides of the flying-off deck and two on the <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a>. The four guns on the flying-off deck were removed in 1926–27 for trials of the lower flight deck, but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded. Four single <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun">QF 2-pounder</a> "pom-poms" were installed in 1927. During "Furious"s September 1930 – February 1932 refit, her anti-aircraft outfit was reinforced by the addition of two eight-barrel QF 2-pounder Mark V pom-pom mounts where the forward 4-inch guns on the flying-off deck had been removed earlier.

The 5.5-inch and 4-inch guns were replaced during her refit in early 1939 by a dozen <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20XVI%20naval%20gun">QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns</a> in six twin <a href="dual%20purpose%20gun">dual-purpose</a> Mark XIX mounts. One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side. Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island superstructure at the same time. While later refitting in the United States, the ship was fitted with a maximum of 22 manually operated automatic <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon</a> light anti-aircraft guns, which replaced the single quadruple <a href="Vickers%20.50%20machine%20gun">Vickers .50 machine gun mount</a>.

A single <a href="High%20Angle%20Control%20System">High Angle Control System</a> director was fitted on the island and another on an elevated mount on the former flying-off deck. Two pom-pom directors were also mounted on the island for the weapons mounted fore and aft of the island.

"Furious" was assigned to the <a href="Atlantic%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Atlantic Fleet</a> after commissioning in 1925 although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and <a href="Fairey%20Flycatcher">Fairey Flycatcher</a> floatplanes, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily. The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge palisades were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather. The first carrier night-landing was made by a <a href="Blackburn%20Dart">Blackburn Dart</a> on 6 May 1926 aboard "Furious". In the 1920s, the ship commonly carried one flight of fighters (Fairey Flycatcher), two of spotters (<a href="Blackburn%20Blackburn">Blackburn Blackburn</a> or <a href="Avro%20Bison">Avro Bison</a>), one spotter reconnaissance (<a href="Fairey%20III">Fairey III</a>D) and two flights of torpedo bombers (Blackburn Dart), each usually of six aircraft.

"Furious" was reduced to reserve on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport</a>. It lasted from September 1930 to February 1932 and was focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers. In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars. Upon completion, she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was from a total of .
"Furious" recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a> with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November. Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a> from May to October 1934. "Furious" was present at the Coronation <a href="Fleet%20Review">Fleet Review</a> at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> on 20 May 1937 for <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a>. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted in Devonport between December 1937 and May 1938 where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the <a href="Munich%20Crisis">Munich Crisis</a> in September 1938, the ship embarked <a href="801%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">801</a>, <a href="821%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">821</a> and <a href="822%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">822</a> Squadrons and joined the fleet at <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair. She was struck a glancing blow by the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> during this time, but suffered only minor damage.

From 1933 to the end of 1938, "Furious" carried 801 Squadron which initially flew a mixture of six <a href="Hawker%20Nimrod">Hawker Nimrod</a> and three Flycatcher fighters. <a href="Hawker%20Osprey">Hawker Osprey</a> fighters replaced the Flycatchers in early 1934 and the Nimrods were withdrawn in October 1936. <a href="811%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">811</a> and 822 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-shipping missions. They flew the <a href="Blackburn%20Ripon">Blackburn Ripon</a>, the <a href="Blackburn%20Baffin">Blackburn Baffin</a> and the <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s as well as the Fairey IIIF, the <a href="Fairey%20Seal">Fairey Seal</a> and the <a href="Blackburn%20Shark">Blackburn Shark</a> reconnaissance aircraft.

The ship was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted anti-aircraft guns on her lower flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. "Furious" resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939. As a deck-landing training carrier in 1939 "Furious" embarked <a href="767%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">767 Squadron</a>, flying Shark, Swordfish and <a href="Fairey%20Albacore">Fairey Albacore</a> torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, and <a href="769%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">769 Squadron</a>, flying <a href="Blackburn%20Skua">Blackburn Skua</a>, <a href="Blackburn%20Roc">Blackburn Roc</a>, and <a href="Gloster%20Sea%20Gladiator">Gloster Sea Gladiator</a> fighters.

"Furious" remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> until 2 October 1939. She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken "Courageous" and embarked nine Swordfish aircraft from <a href="816%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">816 Squadron</a> and a detachment of three more Swordfish from <a href="818%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">818 Squadron</a>. The ship sortied on 8 October with the fleet to unsuccessfully hunt for the and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern <a href="Norway">Norway</a>. After returning from this search, "Furious" departed her berth adjacent to the battleship in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before "Royal Oak" was sunk by . Afterwards she was transferred to <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a>, <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, where she and the battlecruiser formed a hunting group for German raiders. "Furious" served as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> for the convoy bringing most of the <a href="1st%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Division">1st Canadian Infantry Division</a> to Britain in mid-December 1939. In the darkness on 17 December, the west-bound <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a> SS "Samaria" passed through the convoy unseen. She ripped off the horizontal wireless masts on "Furious"s starboard side, carried away five overhanging <a href="Lifeboat%20%28shipboard%29">lifeboat</a>s from the port side of , and just missed the third and fourth ships in line.

"Furious" joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 with only eighteen Swordfish from 816 and 818 Squadrons embarked; no fighters were able to join the ship in time. Sixteen Swordfish made unsuccessful torpedo attacks on German ships in <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a> harbour the following morning. On 12 April, both squadrons attempted to attack German ships in <a href="Narvik">Narvik</a> in bad weather. Disappointed with the failure of the torpedo attacks the previous day, bombs were carried instead. 818 Squadron, making the first attack, damaged several captured Norwegian ships, but lost two aircraft to <a href="flak">flak</a>, although the crews were rescued by the British cruiser and the destroyer . Following 40 minutes behind, 816 Squadron was forced to turn back by heavy weather. One aircraft was lost while landing, but the crew was recovered. Another attack was launched the next day in support of the <a href="Second%20Naval%20Battle%20of%20Narvik">British ships entering Narvik</a>, but they contributed little and another pair of Swordfish were shot down.

"Furious", ordered to remain behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, departed the Narvik area on 14 April, escorted by three destroyers, to refuel at <a href="Troms%C3%B8">Tromsø</a>. En route, her Swordfish attacked <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2052">Junkers Ju 52</a> transports that had landed on frozen Lake <a href="Hartvikvatnet">Hartvikvatnet</a> approximately northeast of Narvik. Two of the Ju 52s were destroyed and several others damaged. She reached the port on 16 April with only 27% of her fuel remaining. She stayed there until 18 April when she headed south to scout the Narvik area. She was attacked en route by a single <a href="Heinkel%20He%20111">Heinkel He 111</a> bomber of the II./<a href="Kampfgeschwader%2026">KG 26</a> wing from very high altitude. Two large bombs narrowly missed the ship, the closest only off the port side aft. The shock shook her <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s out of alignment and jarred the port inner high-pressure turbine so that she was limited to . "Furious" remained off the coast of Norway despite the damage and attempted to fly off aircraft on 22 April, despite severe weather, to discourage German aircraft from delivering supplies to the German forces in Narvik. One aircraft was shot down by the Germans and the others returned reporting heavy snowstorms between the ship and Narvik. The weather worsened the next day and <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Thomas%20Hope%20Troubridge">Troubridge</a> decided to head to <a href="Harstad">Harstad</a> to check the damage from the near miss. It proved worse than anticipated and he was ordered back to the United Kingdom. Only six of the nine remaining Swordfish were serviceable.

After quick repairs, which included the removal of several rows of turbine blades, "Furious" returned to Norway on 18 May carrying the <a href="Gloster%20Gladiator">Gladiators</a> of a reformed <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> <a href="No.%20263%20Squadron%20RAF">263 Squadron</a>; they were flown off on 21 April once their base at <a href="Bardufoss">Bardufoss</a> was ready. One Gladiator and the guiding Swordfish crashed en route, killing all crewmen. The ship returned to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off, carrying only six Sea Gladiators of <a href="804%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">804 Squadron</a> and nine Swordfish of 816 Squadron for self-protection while ferrying 263 Squadron.

On 14 June, carrying only half of 816 Squadron for her own protection, "Furious" sailed unescorted for Halifax carrying £18,000,000 in gold <a href="bullion">bullion</a>. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft with spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain Troubridge ordered all available space should be used to transport sugar to Britain. Upon her arrival, she embarked the rest of 816 Squadron, as well as nine Skuas of 801 Squadron and nine Swordfish of <a href="825%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">825</a>, and made a number of largely unsuccessful air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Tromsø in September and October 1940, at a cost of several aircraft. Both Swordfish squadrons disembarked afterwards to make room as she prepared to resume her role as an aircraft transport.

"Furious" loaded 55 aircraft, mostly crated <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> fighters of <a href="No.%2073%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 73 Squadron RAF</a>, in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> on 7 November 1940 sailing for <a href="Takoradi">Takoradi</a>, <a href="Gold%20Coast%20%28British%20colony%29">Gold Coast</a> on 15 November 1940 where they were flown off or off-loaded on 27 November with the ultimate destination of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. During this time she retained only six Skuas of 801 Squadron for her own protection. "Furious" was back in Liverpool by 15 December where she embarked 40 more Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December 1940 joining with <a href="Convoy%20WS5A">Convoy WS5A</a> and the small carrier "Argus". The encountered the convoy on 25 December 1940, but little damage was inflicted by "Admiral Hipper" before she was driven off by the escorts. No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in "Argus" with bombs that they could not carry and their torpedoes were aboard "Furious". After "Furious"s Skuas had flown off to search for "Hipper", space was made to land the Swordfish to load the torpedoes, but the Skuas could not locate "Admiral Hipper" because of the poor visibility. "Furious" reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941 arriving back in Britain on 5 February 1940 where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi on 4 March, carrying 12 <a href="Fairey%20Fulmar">Fairey Fulmar</a>s of <a href="807%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">807 Squadron</a> and six Swordfish of 825 Squadron for self-defence.

"Furious" now had a new destination for her ferry trips and she transported 24 Hurricanes to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 25 April where they were transferred to to be flown off for <a href="Malta">Malta</a>. She sailed for a brief refit at <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> immediately afterwards. While in Belfast she was hit by one small bomb and near-missed by two others during a German air raid in early May, but was only lightly damaged. The ship loaded another batch of 40 Hurricane IIs, plus nine Fulmars from 'X' Flight of <a href="800%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">800 Squadron</a> in Liverpool, and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to "Ark Royal" via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied "Ark Royal" and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>. "Furious" loaded 48 more Hurricane IIs and arrived back in Gibraltar on 1 June where some of the fighters were transferred to "Ark Royal". The two carriers departed Gibraltar on 4 June and flew off 44 of the 48 fighters. "Furious" returned to the <a href="Firth%20of%20Clyde">Clyde</a> for her biggest load of aircraft yet, 64 Hurricanes, leaving room for only nine Swordfish from 816 Squadron on this voyage. Upon her arrival on 25 June she transferred 22 Hurricanes to "Ark Royal" and that carrier flew them off to Malta the next day. Of the 42 Hurricanes left on "Furious", 26 were moved to "Ark Royal" when she returned on 28 June. This time, however, both carriers sailed to deliver the fighters to their usual take-off point west of Sicily. The tenth of "Furious"s aircraft to take off crashed into her island, killing 14 men and starting a serious fire on the flight deck. The blocked flight deck forced the remaining six Hurricanes to remain on board and they were returned to Gibraltar. "Furious" exchanged 816 Squadron for 818 from "Ark Royal", then departed for home.

In July, "Furious" embarked nine Fulmars of 800 Squadron, 'A' Flight of <a href="880%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">880 Squadron</a> with four <a href="Sea%20Hurricane">Sea Hurricane</a> IBs, nine Swordfish from <a href="812%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">812 Squadron</a> and nine Albacores of <a href="817%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">817 Squadron</a> to <a href="Raid%20on%20Kirkenes%20and%20Petsamo">attack the German-occupied ports of Kirkenes, Norway, and Petsamo, Finland</a>, departing Scapa Flow on the 23rd in company with the carrier , two cruisers and six destroyers. The two carriers and their escorts gathered in <a href="Sey%C3%B0isfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur">Seidisfjord</a>, Iceland, under the command of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Frederic%20Wake-Walker">Wake-Walker</a> where they refuelled in late July. "Furious" attacked ships in Petsamo on 30 July with all of her Swordfish and Albacores, escorted by six Fulmars and all four Sea Hurricanes, but there was very little shipping present. One small ship, MV "Trotter", was sunk, several oil storage tanks were set afire, and several wooden <a href="jetties">jetties</a> were torpedoed. The British ships had been spotted before the attack and two Fulmars and an Albacore were shot down by the alerted defences. "Furious" was short of fuel and had to leave shortly afterwards, but she transferred her Albacores to "Victorious" to fill up that carrier's decimated squadrons before she left. Sea Hurricanes of 880 Squadron shot down a shadowing <a href="Dornier%20Do%2018">Dornier Do 18</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a> on 31 July as the ship was leaving.

On 30 August, "Furious" left Belfast with a load of 49 Hurricanes, carrying three Fulmars of 800 Squadron and four Sea Hurricane IBs of 880A Squadron for self-defence, and nine Swordfish of 812 Squadron for "Ark Royal". She arrived in Gibraltar on 6 September and transferred 40 Hurricanes to the other carrier the next day. "Ark Royal" sailed for the departure point the following day, but could only fly off 14 Hurricanes because some of the <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a> bombers used to guide the fighters to Malta failed to make their rendezvous. When "Ark Royal" returned, she transferred the six Swordfish of 810 Squadron to "Furious" and both carriers departed that same day to deliver the Hurricanes. This was "Furious"s last ferry mission as she was sent to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, for a lengthy refit. She arrived on 7 October and did not return to the United Kingdom until April 1942.

"Furious" spent the next three months after her return <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">working up</a>. In August, she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in <a href="Operation%20Pedestal">Operation Pedestal</a>, but she was only to sail far enough with them to allow her 38 <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s to reach Malta. This she did, just as "Eagle" was torpedoed, but "Furious" turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day southeast of the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a>. After this mission, "Furious" was sent back to the Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a> and the ship arrived at Gibraltar on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on 29 August before returning to Gibraltar and being assigned to <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a>.

As part of Operation Torch, "Furious" embarked 12 <a href="Supermarine%20Seafire">Supermarine Seafire</a> IBs of 801 Squadron, another 12 Seafire IICs of 807 Squadron and nine Albacores of 822 Squadron to provide air cover for the amphibious landings by the Central Task Force. On the morning of 8 November, "Furious"s Seafires <a href="Strafing">strafed</a> the <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a> airfield at <a href="Tafraoui">Tafraoui</a>, destroying three aircraft on the ground and shooting down one <a href="Dewoitine%20D.520">Dewoitine D.520</a> fighter, the first air-to-air kill by a Seafire. Eight Albacores, escorted by Sea Hurricanes from two <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a>s, attacked the field at <a href="Es%20S%C3%A9nia">La Senia</a>. They were attacked by D.520s as they began their attack dive, but they destroyed 47 aircraft on the ground despite the loss of an Albacore from anti-aircraft fire and the loss of three and damage to two more against the French fighters. Seafires of 807 Squadron from "Furious" covered the landings at <a href="Oran">Oran</a>, engaging a flight of D.520s, shooting down three and destroying about twenty aircraft on the ground.

"Furious" remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to the Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July, the fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>; "Furious"s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report, then shoot it down. She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training. During the passage of Convoy JW-57 from the UK to Russia in February 1944, "Furious", escorted by the British battleship and the , attacked German shipping off the Norwegian coast on 24 February 1944. The carrier had the Seafire IBs of 801 Squadron aboard, plus the <a href="Fairey%20Barracuda">Fairey Barracuda</a> torpedo bombers of <a href="827%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">827 Squadron</a> and <a href="830%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">830 Squadrons</a>. No aircraft were lost and a beached freighter was destroyed.

In preparation for <a href="Operation%20Tungsten">Operation Tungsten</a>, an attack on the , "Furious" and "Victorious" exchanged Barracuda squadrons, 827 for <a href="831%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">831 Squadron</a>, so that the squadrons that trained together could fly together. "Furious" also embarked 880 Squadron with eight Seafire L.IIC fighters to reinforce the six Seafire IBs of 801 Squadron. On the morning of 3 April 1944, 21 Barracudas of 827 and 830 Squadrons made the first attack just as the "Tirpitz" was getting under way for sea trials. The Germans were caught entirely by surprise and the "Tirpitz"s smokescreen was only just beginning to form. The British aircraft enjoyed a clear view of their target and hit the German battleship six times. An hour later the second wave of 19 Barracudas from 829 and 831 Squadrons arrived and scored eight more hits. Only one Barracuda was shot down from each wave and another crashed on take-off. 801 and 880 Squadrons were retained for fleet air defence during the operation. "Tirpitz"s superstructure and upper hull was moderately damaged by the bombs, but her machinery was intact because the Barracuda pilots pressed home their attack below the altitude necessary to give their <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armour-piercing</a> bombs enough velocity to penetrate "Tirpitz"s main armoured deck. Nonetheless "Tirpitz" was under repair for three months.

The Home Fleet tried another attack on "Tirpitz" later on 23 April 1944, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made that day and for the next several days. Instead, the aircraft attempted to attack installations at <a href="Bod%C3%B8">Bodø</a> on 26 April 1944, but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. "Furious" and the escort carrier attacked shipping in the vicinity of <a href="Kristiansund">Kristiansund</a> and sank the <a href="Bulk%20carrier">ore carrier</a> "Almora" and the <a href="tanker%20%28ship%29">tanker</a> "Saarburg" for the loss of two aircraft on 6 May 1944. Another attack on "Tirpitz" by the Home Fleet had to be abandoned on 15 May 1944 because of poor weather. Yet another attempt on 28 May was foiled by bad weather, but a German convoy was successfully attacked on 1 June 1944. One ammunition ship was sunk and two others were set on fire.

"Furious" and the fleet carriers and made another attempt to sink the "Tirpitz" on 17 July 1944, in <a href="Operation%20Mascot">Operation Mascot</a>. For this attack the carrier embarked 880 Squadron with three Seafire L.IICs, 20 <a href="Grumman%20Hellcat">Grumman Hellcat</a>s of <a href="1840%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1840 Squadron</a>, Barracudas of 830 Squadron and three Swordfish of 842 Flight. The Barracudas, heavily loaded with bombs of up to , launched using a wooden ramp that was temporarily placed at the end of the flight deck, an early example of what was to be later named the <a href="Ski-jump%20%28aviation%29">ski-jump</a>. The attack was unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences as a smokescreen covered the German battleship so that the Barracudas had to drop their bombs blindly through the smoke. Four more attacks on "Tirpitz" were made in August 1944 under the name of <a href="Operation%20Goodwood%20%28naval%29">Operation Goodwood</a> in a concerted effort to sink her. "Furious" carried twelve Seafire F.IIIs of 801 Squadron, another twelve Seafire L.IICs of 880 Squadron and nine Barracudas of 827 Squadron for this operation. The first attack on 20 August 1944 was recalled because of bad weather, but the attack on 22 August 1944 was spotted by the Germans and 11 aircraft were lost. Another attack was made two days later; one armour-piercing bomb penetrated "Tirpitz"s armoured deck but failed to detonate, and another bomb did only superficial damage. A fourth attack was made on 29 August, but inflicted no damage.

By this time the ship's age and limitations became increasingly apparent and she was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. The ship was <a href="paid%20off">paid off</a> in April 1945 being berthed at <a href="Loch%20Striven">Loch Striven</a>, was used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. "Furious" was sold in 1948 for <a href="scrap">scrap</a>, and had been completely broken up in <a href="Troon">Troon</a> by 1954.

HMS Argus (I49)

HMS "Argus" was a British <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> that served in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> from 1918 to 1944. She was converted from an <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a> that was under construction when the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> began and became the first example of the standard pattern of aircraft carrier, with a full-length <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> that allowed wheeled aircraft to take off and land. After commissioning, the ship was involved for several years in the development of the optimum design for other aircraft carriers. "Argus" also evaluated various types of <a href="arresting%20gear">arresting gear</a>, general procedures needed to operate a number of aircraft in concert and fleet tactics. The ship was too top-heavy as originally built and had to be modified to improve her stability in the mid-1920s. She spent one brief deployment on the <a href="China%20Station">China Station</a> in the late 1920s before being placed in <a href="Reserve%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">reserve</a> for budgetary reasons.

"Argus" was recommissioned and partially modernised shortly before the Second World War and served as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month she made the first of her many <a href="Malta%20Convoys">ferry trips</a> to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to <a href="Malta">Malta</a>; she was largely occupied in this task for the next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to <a href="Murmansk">Murmansk</a> in Russia, <a href="Sekondi-Takoradi">Takoradi</a> on the <a href="Gold%20Coast%20%28British%20colony%29">Gold Coast</a>, and <a href="Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavík</a> in Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and "Argus" was pressed into front-line service despite her lack of speed and armament. In June, she participated in <a href="Operation%20Harpoon%20%281942%29">Operation Harpoon</a>, providing air cover for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided air cover during <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>, the invasion of <a href="French%20North%20Africa">French North Africa</a> and was slightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, "Argus" was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an <a href="accommodation%20ship">accommodation ship</a> and was listed for disposal in mid-1946. "Argus" was sold in late 1946 and <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> the following year.

"Argus" had her genesis in the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>'s desire during the First World War for an aircraft carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, but had no way to recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder <a href="William%20Beardmore%20and%20Company">William Beardmore</a> had proposed to the Admiralty an aircraft carrier design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a>s "Conte Rosso" and "Giulio Cesare" had been suspended by William Beardmore and Company at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty's criteria. "Conte Rosso" was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of "Giulio Cesare", and the company began work on converting the ship.

The initial design had two <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23I">islands</a> with the flight deck running between them. Each island contained one <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a>; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. The islands were connected by braces and the <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> was mounted on top of the bracing, which left a clear height of for the aircraft on the flight deck. Fairly early in the design process, the decision was made to delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.

In November 1916, the ship's design was tested in a <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a> by the <a href="National%20Physical%20Laboratory%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Physical Laboratory</a> to evaluate the turbulence caused by the twin islands and the bridge over them. They were found to cause problems, but no changes were made until the ship was nearly complete. In April 1918, "Argus" was ordered to be modified to a <a href="flush%20deck">flush-decked</a> configuration after the <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s of the carrier had revealed severe turbulence problems caused by her superstructure. The ship was given a bridge underneath her flight deck, extending from side to side, and she was fitted with a retractable <a href="pilot%20house">pilot house</a> in the middle of the flight deck for use when not operating aircraft.

"Argus"s stability had been a concern from the beginning. Despite having been originally conceived as a liner with a hull designed to minimise rolling, most of the changes made to the ship during her conversion added topside weight, raising her centre of gravity. Even the addition of of <a href="Sailing%20ballast">ballast</a> still left the ship with a very low <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of only lightly loaded and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. This meant that she was very steady, but <a href="Heeling%20%28sailing%29">heeled</a> noticeably when turning. The ship proved to be very manoeuvrable at medium and high speeds, but steered badly at low speeds and in wind due to her large surface area.

"Argus" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a beam of , and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at deep load. She displaced at <a href="Standard%20displacement%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a> and at deep load. Each of the ship's four sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s drove one <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>. Steam was supplied by 12 cylindrical <a href="Scotch%20boiler">Scotch boiler</a>s. The turbines were designed for a total of , but they produced during her sea trials in September 1918, and gave "Argus" a speed of . The ship carried of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, which gave her a range of at .

The ship's flight deck was long and her <a href="hangar">hangar</a> was long, wide, and high. Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">aircraft lifts</a> (elevators); the forward lift measured and the rear . "Argus" was the only British carrier serving in the Second World War capable of striking down (stowing away) aircraft with non-folding wings because of her wide lifts and tall hangar ceiling. Three <a href="fire%20curtain">fire curtain</a>s divided the hangar and another separated the hangar and the <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a>. She could accommodate between 15 and 18 aircraft. No arresting gear was fitted as completed. Two large <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">cranes</a> were positioned on the quarterdeck, beneath the rear of the flight deck. Petrol storage consisted of in tins stowed below the waterline. The ship's crew totalled 495 officers and men.

The ship was armed with four <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20V%20naval%20gun"></a> <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a>s, two on the quarterdeck and one on each side of the hull. She was also fitted with two low-angle 4-inch guns, one also on each side of the hull. The rear <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> and the torpedo warhead storage magazine were protected by a total of of protective plating on all sides, but the forward magazine and bomb storage rooms only had a 2-inch thick deck to protect them.

"Argus" was <a href="Keel">laid down</a> in 1914 by William Beardmore and Company in <a href="Dalmuir">Dalmuir</a>, as the "Conte Rosso". She was renamed after her purchase in September 1916 and was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 2 December 1917, her building having been slowed by labour shortages. The ship was commissioned on 16 September 1918. Formally named after <a href="Argus%20Panoptes">Argus of the 100 Eyes</a> from Greek mythology, "Argus" was nicknamed the "Hat Box" or the "Flatiron" due to her flat-topped appearance.

After commissioning too late to participate in the First World War, "Argus" was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from "Furious". The first landing on the ship was made on 1 October 1918 by a <a href="Sopwith%201%C2%BD%20Strutter">Sopwith Ship Strutter</a>. The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and <a href="Sopwith%20Pup">Sopwith Pup</a>s. "Argus" was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush with the rest of the flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. "Argus" joined the <a href="Atlantic%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Atlantic Fleet</a> in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a> fighters, two <a href="Airco%20DH.9A">Airco DH.9A</a> bombers and two <a href="Fairey%20Aviation%20Company">Fairey</a> <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown over the side of the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.

After the ship's return from its cruise, a conference was convened aboard "Argus" on 19 May to consider revised landing arrangements. It was decided that a longer system of wires was needed, and the landing well system was abandoned in favour of ramps that could be raised and lowered as needed. Powered <a href="palisade">palisade</a>s were also needed on the side of the flight deck to help retain aircraft aboard that had not engaged a wire. The revised system was successfully tested aboard the carrier later in the year and "Argus" arresting gear was modified accordingly in time for the 1921 Spring Cruise, during which the ship carried ten <a href="Parnall%20Panther">Parnall Panther</a> spotter and <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a> and three <a href="Fairey%20III">Fairey III</a>C reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, the ship's after lift was permanently locked in the raised position and of ballast were added to compensate for the additional weight of the equipment high in the ship. This cruise was deemed very successful as 45 landings were made, only two of which resulted in serious accidents, an accident rate comparable to those of land-based units. The time required to launch two aircraft and land one aboard was forty minutes during this cruise, primarily because the rotary engines of the time were very difficult to start.

On September 1922, "Argus", equipped with <a href="Gloster%20Nightjar">Gloster Nightjar</a> fighters, was deployed to the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> as a response to the <a href="Chanak%20crisis">Chanak crisis</a>. As well as operating her own aircraft, "Argus" was used to fly off <a href="Bristol%20F.2%20Fighter">Bristol Fighters</a> that had been ferried to the Dardanelles aboard the <a href="seaplane%20carrier">seaplane carrier</a> to an airfield at <a href="%C5%9Eile">Kilia</a> on the European side of the straits. (The aircraft could not be flown off "Ark Royal" since it was a seaplane carrier with no flight deck. The Bristol Fighters were transferred to "Argus" by crane).

In July 1922, "Argus" was <a href="Inclining%20test">inclined</a> to evaluate her stability in light of the additional weights that had been added since her completion and it was discovered that her metacentric height had been reduced by . The Director of Naval Construction proposed to fit her with a <a href="Anti-torpedo%20bulge">girdle</a> at her <a href="waterline">waterline</a> to increase her beam and thus her stability. He intended to do this under the 1923–1924 Naval Programme, but this was delayed several times as the ship was needed for training and when she was finally modified it was under the 1925–1926 Naval Programme. Girdling increased her deep displacement to and her beam to , and reduced her draught to and her speed by a quarter of a knot. The ship was also fitted with bulk petrol storage, new four-inch guns that used <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23Fixed%20QF">fixed ammunition</a>, and new radio masts.
"Argus" usually operated about 15 aircraft during the 1920s. This was commonly divided up between one small flight of fighters (Gloster Nightjars or <a href="Fairey%20Flycatcher">Fairey Flycatcher</a>s), one of spotters (Parnall Panthers or <a href="Avro%20Bison">Avro Bison</a>s), and one spotter reconnaissance flight with Fairey IIIs.

The ship's hull was surveyed in 1927 and anticipated to be sound for another 15 years, and she relieved on the <a href="China%20Station">China Station</a> from 1 September to 20 March 1928. Sometime after her return, "Argus" was laid up at Plymouth at 14-days readiness to save money. Since she was completed before 9 December 1921, the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> classified her as an experimental aircraft carrier and thus she did not need to be scrapped to release treaty-limited tonnage for new construction. The ship was reduced to Extended Reserve (four months readiness) at <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> in September 1932. In February 1936, it was decided to refit the ship as a tender for <a href="De%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth%23Variants">Queen Bee</a> <a href="target%20drone">target drone</a>s. The opportunity was taken to widen her flight deck by and replace her old boilers with six new <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>-type boilers which could generate more steam than her turbines could handle. The ship was intended to have one hydro-pneumatic <a href="aircraft%20catapult">aircraft catapult</a>, but this was instead diverted to . Since "Argus" was now classified as a naval auxiliary, her four-inch guns were removed. Her refit was completed on 30 July 1938 and she underwent sea trials the following month.

After recommissioning, "Argus" served as a training carrier to allow pilots to practice their deck-landing skills. She was carrying out this duty in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Lion">Gulf of Lion</a> when the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> began. By April 1940, the ship had been rearmed with two <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20V%20naval%20gun">QF Mk V 4-inch</a> anti-aircraft guns on her quarterdeck, as well as three quadruple <a href="Vickers%20.50%20machine%20gun">Vickers .50 machine gun mounts</a>; one of these was on each side of her hull and the third was on the centreline of the quarterdeck. Together with the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> and six destroyers, "Argus" escorted Convoy US-3, loaded with Australian and New Zealand troops, to the United Kingdom in mid-June. A week later, she ferried <a href="Supermarine%20Walrus">Supermarine Walrus</a> amphibians of <a href="701%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">701 Squadron</a> to <a href="Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavík</a>, Iceland. "Argus" loaded a dozen <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> and two <a href="Blackburn%20Skua">Blackburn Skua</a> fighters of 418 Flight RAF in late July for delivery to Malta as part of <a href="Operation%20Hurry">Operation Hurry</a>. Escorted by "Ark Royal", three battleships, two cruisers and 10 destroyers, the ship flew them off without incident on 2 August 1940 from a point west of <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, although two of the Hurricanes crashed on landing. Accompanied by the battleship and escorted by two destroyers, she returned to <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> to load 30 Hurricanes with their wings removed. "Argus" sailed on 22 August and arrived at <a href="Sekondi-Takoradi">Takoradi</a> on the <a href="Gold%20Coast%20%28British%20colony%29">Gold Coast</a> on 5 September where her aircraft were off-loaded. After her return to the United Kingdom, the ship was briefly refitted and she ferried 701 Squadron back to the United Kingdom in late October.

On 11 November, "Argus" sailed again from Liverpool with a deck-load of a dozen Hurricanes and two Skuas for delivery to Malta (<a href="Operation%20White">Operation White</a>). She rendezvoused with <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a> four days later and launched the aircraft on the morning of 17 November. Eight of the Hurricanes ran out of fuel en route due to <a href="headwind">headwind</a>s and one Skua was forced to <a href="emergency%20landing">crash land</a> on Sicily after it had been damaged by Italian <a href="flak">flak</a>. In mid-December, the ship embarked six <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> torpedo bombers of <a href="821%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">821X Squadron</a> for delivery to Gibraltar and another pair of Swordfish from <a href="825%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">825 Squadron</a> for self-defence. The carrier rendezvoused with "Furious" and Convoy WS-5A before the combined force was discovered by the on 25 December, but little damage was inflicted by "Hipper" before she was driven off by the escorts. No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in "Argus" with bombs that they could not carry and the torpedoes were aboard "Furious". After "Furious"s Skuas had flown off to search for "Hipper", space was cleared to allow "Argus" Swordfish to load the torpedoes, but the Skuas could not locate "Hipper" because of the poor visibility. "Argus" delivered 821X Squadron to Gibraltar and was back in the United Kingdom by 14 January 1941.
In March, the carrier loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and delivered them to Gibraltar on 29 March, where they were loaded onto "Ark Royal" and flown off to Malta a few days later. She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of <a href="812%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">812 Squadron</a> for self-defence. After a brief refit, "Argus" sailed on 14 April for Gibraltar to transfer the replacements to "Ark Royal". She arrived on 24 April and began a two-week refit after the aircraft were transferred. The ship was back in the United Kingdom, loading another batch of Hurricanes bound for Gibraltar. Three Fulmars of <a href="800%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">800X Squadron</a> were also embarked to protect the ship against the <a href="Focke-Wulf%20Fw%20200">Focke-Wulf Fw 200</a> Condors that patrolled the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a> and the Eastern <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a>. The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft, including 800X Squadron. On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit.

In late August to early September, "Argus" transported 24 Hurricanes of <a href="No.%20151%20Wing%20RAF">No. 151 Wing RAF</a> to <a href="Murmansk">Murmansk</a>, Russia. She then ferried a dozen <a href="Fairey%20Albacore">Fairey Albacore</a> torpedo bombers of <a href="828%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">828 Squadron</a> to Gibraltar on 30 September for eventual delivery to Malta. She was to ferry the fighters of <a href="804%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">804 Squadron</a> on her return trip to England, but this was cancelled. Eventually, the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied "Eagle" back to the United Kingdom on 20 October. "Argus" loaded more Hurricanes for Gibraltar and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from <a href="818%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">818 Squadron</a> and two Sea Hurricanes from 804X Squadron for self-defence. The ship arrived on 8 November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal. Two days later, the two carriers, in <a href="Operation%20Perpetual">Operation Perpetual</a>, sailed to the west of Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes; three of the fighters were lost en route. "Ark Royal" was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar, which forced "Argus" to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the sole carrier available.

Force H was recalled to the United Kingdom in January and "Argus" loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron for her own protection. Whilst in the United Kingdom, she loaded some <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> fighters and returned to Gibraltar on 24 February. There, the ship transferred the Spitfires to "Eagle" and embarked nine <a href="Fairey%20Fulmar">Fairey Fulmar</a> fighters of <a href="807%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">807 Squadron</a>. The plan for <a href="Operation%20Spotter">Operation Spotter</a> I was for "Argus" to provide fighter cover for "Eagle" as she flew off the Spitfires for Malta, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7 March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off. During <a href="Operation%20Picket">Operation Picket</a> I, nine more Spitfires were flown off by "Eagle" on 21 March whilst a dozen Sea Hurricane IIBs from 804 Squadron provided air cover from "Argus". The two carriers repeated the delivery on 29 March when "Eagle" flew off seven more Spitfires whilst 807 Squadron provided air cover from "Argus". The latter ship also carried six Albacores bound for Malta as well, but the weather deteriorated over Malta and their fly-off was cancelled.

Another attempt to deliver the Albacores and more Spitfires was made during <a href="Operation%20LB">Operation LB</a>. As usual, "Argus" provided the air cover with a dozen Fulmars from 807 Squadron and "Eagle" ferried the Albacores and 17 Spitfires to their take-off point for Malta on 19 May. The Spitfires were flown off successfully, but the engines of the Albacores all began to overheat and they were forced to return to the carrier. Examination of the aircraft revealed that their air coolers had been set to "Winter" rather than "Summer". One of the Fulmars was shot down by <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a> <a href="Dewoitine%20D.520">Dewoitine D.520</a> fighters as it attempted to protect the crew of a <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">Consolidated PBY Catalina</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a> that had been shot down earlier. By this time the ship's <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> .50-calibre machine guns had been replaced by 13 <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm</a> light anti-aircraft guns.

Afterwards, the ship returned to the UK to ferry <a href="801%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">801 Squadron</a> to Gibraltar and delivered the unit on 7 June. Together with "Eagle", "Argus" was tasked to provide air cover over Force H as it covered a convoy attempting to get desperately needed supplies through to Malta later in June (<a href="Operation%20Harpoon%20%281942%29">Operation Harpoon</a>). The carrier embarked two Fulmars from 807 Squadron, nine Swordfish from <a href="813%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">813 Squadron</a> and four more Swordfish from <a href="824%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">824 Squadron</a> to protect the convoy from submarines while "Eagle" loaded 20 Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes from three different squadrons. One Swordfish crashed while landing on 13 June and the wreckage was pushed over the side. Both Fulmars from 807 Squadron were shot down on 14 June by Italian bombers, but they likely shot down one <a href="Savoia-Marchetti%20SM.79">Savoia-Marchetti SM.79</a> and one <a href="CANT%20Z.1007">CANT Z.1007</a> bomber. "Eagle" transferred her Fulmars to "Argus" over the course of the battle and two more were lost later in the day. The ship was attacked multiple times by bombs and torpedoes during the battle without effect.
As part of the preparations for another resupply convoy for Malta (<a href="Operation%20Pedestal">Operation Pedestal</a>), "Argus" returned to the United Kingdom in late June to load reserve aircraft, including six Sea Hurricanes of 804 Squadron, for the other aircraft carriers involved in the operation and left the <a href="River%20Clyde">Clyde</a> on 2 August for Gibraltar. The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 5 August for a three-day training exercise to work out co-ordination procedures before the operation commenced and 804 Squadron was deemed not ready for combat. It was ordered to return to the UK aboard "Argus".

In November 1942, "Argus" was assigned to the Eastern Naval Task Force that invaded <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, Algeria, during the Allied landings in French North Africa with 18 <a href="Supermarine%20Seafire">Supermarine Seafire</a> IICs of <a href="880%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">880 Squadron</a> aboard. The ship was hit by a bomb on 10 November that killed four men. She and the <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a> joined a convoy returning to the United Kingdom on the evening of 14/15 November that was spotted by the Germans. torpedoed "Avenger", right behind "Argus" in the convoy, later that morning. The ship was under repair for a month after she reached the United Kingdom, but she required a more thorough refit that lasted from February to May 1943. Reclassified as an escort carrier after the completion of her refit, she was relegated to deck-landing training. She was ordered to be paid off on 27 January 1944, but this order was apparently revoked as she continued training until 27 September 1944 when the last take-off was made from her deck. In March, she was ordered to be converted to an aircraft freighter around the end of the year, but this plan was also apparently cancelled. "Argus" became an accommodation ship at Chatham in December and she was approved for scrapping on 6 May 1946. She was sold to <a href="Thos%20W%20Ward">Thos W Ward</a> on 5 December 1946 and arrived at <a href="Inverkeithing">Inverkeithing</a> later that month to be broken up.

We Are the World

"We Are the World" is a <a href="charity%20record">charity single</a> originally recorded by the <a href="charity%20supergroup">supergroup</a> United Support of Artists (USA) for Africa in 1985. It was written by <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> and <a href="Lionel%20Richie">Lionel Richie</a> and produced by <a href="Quincy%20Jones">Quincy Jones</a> for the album "<a href="We%20Are%20the%20World%20%28album%29">We Are the World</a>". With sales in excess of 20 million copies, it is one of fewer than 30 retail singles to have <a href="list%20of%20best-selling%20singles%20worldwide">sold at least 10 million</a> copies worldwide.

Following <a href="Band%20Aid%20%28band%29">Band Aid</a>'s 1984 "<a href="Do%20They%20Know%20It%27s%20Christmas%3F">Do They Know It's Christmas?</a>" project in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, an idea for the creation of an American benefit single for African famine relief came from activist <a href="Harry%20Belafonte">Harry Belafonte</a>, who, along with fundraiser <a href="Ken%20Kragen">Ken Kragen</a>, was instrumental in bringing the vision to reality. Several musicians were contacted by the pair, before Jackson and Richie were assigned the task of writing the song. The duo completed the writing of "We Are the World" seven weeks after the release of "Do They Know It's Christmas?", and one night before the song's first recording session, on January 21, 1985. The historic event brought together some of the most famous artists in the music industry at the time.

The song was released on March 7, 1985, as the first single from the album. A worldwide commercial success, it topped music charts throughout the world and became the fastest-selling American pop single in history. The first ever single to be <a href="music%20recording%20sales%20certification">certified</a> multi-platinum, "We Are the World" received a Quadruple Platinum certification by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>.

Awarded numerous honors—including three <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s, one <a href="American%20Music%20Award">American Music Award</a>, and a <a href="People%27s%20Choice%20Award">People's Choice Award</a>—the song was promoted with a critically received music video, a home video, a special edition magazine, a <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a>, and several books, posters, and shirts. The promotion and merchandise aided the success of "We Are the World" and raised over $63 million (equivalent to $ million today) for humanitarian aid in <a href="Africa">Africa</a> and the <a href="US">US</a>.

Following the devastation caused by the <a href="moment%20magnitude%20scale">magnitude 7.0 M</a> <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">earthquake in Haiti</a> on January 12, 2010, a remake of the song by another all-star cast of singers was recorded on February 1, 2010. Entitled "<a href="We%20Are%20the%20World%2025%20for%20Haiti">We Are the World 25 for Haiti</a>", it was released as a single on February 12, 2010, and proceeds from the record aided survivors in the impoverished country.

Before the writing of "We Are the World", American entertainer and social activist <a href="Harry%20Belafonte">Harry Belafonte</a> had thought for some time to have a song recorded by the most famous artists in the music industry at the time. He planned to have the proceeds donated to a new organization called United Support of Artists for Africa (USA for Africa). The non-profit foundation would then feed and relieve starving people in Africa, specifically <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, where around one million people died during the country's <a href="1983%E2%80%931985%20famine%20in%20Ethiopia">1983–1985 famine</a>. The idea followed <a href="Band%20Aid%20%28band%29">Band Aid</a>'s "<a href="Do%20They%20Know%20It%27s%20Christmas%3F">Do They Know It's Christmas?</a>" project in the UK, which Belafonte had heard about. He also planned money to be set aside to help eliminate <a href="Hunger%20in%20the%20United%20States">hunger in the United States of America</a>. Entertainment manager and fellow fundraiser <a href="Ken%20Kragen">Ken Kragen</a> was contacted by Belafonte, who asked for singers <a href="Lionel%20Richie">Lionel Richie</a> and <a href="Kenny%20Rogers">Kenny Rogers</a>—Kragen's clients—to participate in Belafonte's musical endeavor. Kragen and the two musicians agreed to help with Belafonte's mission, and in turn, enlisted the cooperation of <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>, to add more "name value" to their project. <a href="Quincy%20Jones">Quincy Jones</a> was drafted to co-produce the song, taking time out from his work on "<a href="The%20Color%20Purple%20%28film%29">The Color Purple</a>". Jones also telephoned <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, who had just released the commercially successful "<a href="Thriller%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Thriller</a>" album and had concluded <a href="Victory%20Tour%20%28The%20Jacksons%20tour%29">a tour</a> with <a href="The%20Jacksons">his brothers</a>.
Jackson revealed to Richie that he not only wanted to sing the song, but to participate in its writing as well. To begin with, "We Are the World" was to be written by Jackson, Richie, and Wonder. As Wonder had limited time to work on the project, Jackson and Richie proceeded to write "We Are the World" themselves. They began creating the song at Hayvenhurst, the <a href="Jackson%20family">Jackson family</a> home in <a href="Encino%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Encino</a>. For a week, the two spent every night working on lyrics and melodies in Jackson's bedroom. They knew that they wanted a song that would be easy to sing and memorable. The pair wanted to create an <a href="anthem">anthem</a>. Jackson's older sister <a href="La%20Toya%20Jackson">La Toya</a> watched the two work on the song, and later contended that Richie only wrote a few lines for the track. She stated that her younger brother wrote 99 percent of the lyrics, "but he's never felt it necessary to say that". La Toya further commented on the song's creation in an interview with the American celebrity news magazine "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>". "I'd go into the room while they were writing and it would be very quiet, which is odd, since Michael's usually very cheery when he works. It was very emotional for them."
Richie had recorded two melodies for "We Are the World", which Jackson took, adding music and words to the song in the same day. Jackson stated, "I love working quickly. I went ahead without even Lionel knowing, I couldn't wait. I went in and came out the same night with the song completed—drums, piano, strings, and words to the chorus." Jackson then presented his demo to Richie and Jones, who were both shocked; they did not expect the pop star to see the structure of the song so quickly. The next meetings between Jackson and Richie were unfruitful; the pair did not produce any additional vocals and got no work done. It was not until the night of January 21, 1985, that Richie and Jackson completed the lyrics and melody of "We Are the World" within two and a half hours, one night before the song's first recording session.

The first night of recording, January 22, 1985, had tight security on hand, as Richie, Jackson, Wonder, and Jones started work on "We Are the World" at Kenny Rogers' Lion Share Recording Studio. The studio, on <a href="Beverly%20Boulevard">Beverly Boulevard</a> in California, was filled with musicians, technicians, video crews, <a href="retinue">retinue</a>s, assistants, and organizers as the four musicians entered. To begin the night, a "vocal guide" of "We Are the World" was recorded by Richie and Jackson and duplicated on tape for each of the invited performers. The guide was recorded on the sixth <a href="take">take</a>, as Quincy Jones felt that there was too much "thought" in the previous versions.

Following their work on the vocal guide, Jackson and Jones began thinking of alternatives for the line "There's a chance we're taking, we're taking our own lives": the pair was concerned that the latter part of the line would be considered a reference to suicide. As the group listened to a playback of the chorus, Richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to "We're 'saving' our own lives", which his fellow musicians agreed with. Producer Jones also suggested altering the former part of the line. "One thing we don't want to do, especially with this group, is look like we're patting ourselves on the back. So it's really, 'There's a "choice" we're making.'" Around 1:30 am, the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of melodic vocalizations, including the sound "sha-lum sha-lin-gay". Jones told the group that they were not to add anything else to the tape. "If we get too good, someone's gonna start playing it on the radio," he announced.

On January 24, 1985, after a day of rest, Jones shipped Richie and Jackson's vocal guide to all of the artists who would be involved in "We Are the World"s recording. Enclosed in the package was a letter from Jones, addressed to "My Fellow Artists":

Ken Kragen chaired a production meeting at a bungalow off <a href="Sunset%20Boulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a> on January 25, 1985. There, Kragen and his team discussed where the recording sessions with the supergroup of musicians should take place. He stated, "The single most damaging piece of information is where we're doing this. If that shows up anywhere, we've got a chaotic situation that could totally destroy the project. The moment a Prince, a Michael Jackson, a <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>—I guarantee you!—drives up and sees a mob around that studio, he will never come in." On the same night, Quincy Jones' associate producer and vocal arranger, <a href="Tom%20Bahler">Tom Bahler</a>, was given the task of matching each solo line with the right voice. Bahler stated, "It's like vocal arranging in a perfect world." Jones disagreed, stating that the task was like "putting a watermelon in a <a href="Coca-Cola">Coke</a> bottle". The following evening, Lionel Richie held a "choreography" session at his home, where it was decided who would stand where.

The final night of recording was held on January 28, 1985, at A&M Recording Studios in Hollywood. Michael Jackson arrived at 9 pm, earlier than the other artists, to record his solo section and record a vocal chorus by himself. He was subsequently joined in the recording studio by the remaining USA for Africa artists, who included <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a>, <a href="Billy%20Joel">Billy Joel</a>, <a href="Diana%20Ross">Diana Ross</a>, <a href="Cyndi%20Lauper">Cyndi Lauper</a>, <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>, and <a href="Smokey%20Robinson">Smokey Robinson</a>. Also in attendance were five of <a href="Jackson%20family">Jackson's siblings</a>: <a href="Jackie%20Jackson">Jackie</a>, <a href="La%20Toya%20Jackson">La Toya</a>, <a href="Marlon%20Jackson">Marlon</a>, <a href="Randy%20Jackson%20%28The%20Jacksons%29">Randy</a>, and <a href="Tito%20Jackson">Tito</a>. Many of the participants came straight from an <a href="American%20Music%20Award">American Music Award</a> ceremony, which had been held that same night. Invited musician <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>, who would have had a part in which he and Michael Jackson sang to each other, did not attend the recording session. The reason given for his absence has varied. One newspaper claimed that Prince did not want to record with other acts. Another report, from the time of "We Are the World"'s recording, suggested that the musician did not want to partake in the session because organizer <a href="Bob%20Geldof">Bob Geldof</a> called him a "creep". Prince did, however, donate an exclusive track, "4 The Tears In Your Eyes", for the "<a href="We%20Are%20the%20World%20%28album%29">We Are the World</a>" album. In all, more than 45 of America's top musicians participated in the recording, and another 50 had to be turned away. Upon entering the recording studio, the musicians were greeted by a sign pinned to the door which read, "Please check your egos at the door." They were also greeted by Stevie Wonder, who proclaimed that if the recording was not completed in one take, he and Ray Charles, two blind men, would drive everybody home.

Each of the performers took their position at around 10:30 pm and began to sing. Several hours passed before Stevie Wonder announced that he would like to substitute a line in <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a> for the "sha-lum sha-lin-gay" sound. At this point, <a href="Waylon%20Jennings">Waylon Jennings</a> left the recording studio for a short time when it was suggested by some that the song be sung in Swahili. A heated debate ensued, in which several artists also rejected the suggestion. The "sha-lum sha-lin-gay" sound ran into opposition as well and was subsequently removed from the song. Jennings returned to the studio and participated in the recording, which bears his name in the end credits. The participants eventually decided to sing something meaningful in English. They chose to sing the new line "One world, Our children", which most of the participants enjoyed.

In the early hours of the morning, two Ethiopian women, guests of Stevie Wonder, were brought into the recording studio—it had been decided that a portion of the proceeds raised would be used to bring aid to those affected by the <a href="1984%E2%80%931985%20famine%20in%20Ethiopia">recent famine in Ethiopia</a>. They thanked the singers on behalf of their country, bringing several artists to tears, before being led from the room. Wonder attempted to lighten the mood, by joking that the recording session gave him a chance to "see" fellow blind musician Ray Charles. "We just sort of bumped into each other!" The solo parts of the song were recorded without any problems. The final version of "We Are the World" was completed at 8 am.

"We Are the World" is sung from a first person viewpoint, allowing the audience to "internalize" the message by singing the word "we" together. It has been described as "an appeal to human compassion". The first lines in the song's repetitive chorus proclaim, "We are the world, we are the children, we are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving". "We Are the World" opens with Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, <a href="Paul%20Simon">Paul Simon</a>, Kenny Rogers, <a href="James%20Ingram">James Ingram</a>, <a href="Tina%20Turner">Tina Turner</a>, and <a href="Billy%20Joel">Billy Joel</a> singing the first verse. Michael Jackson and Diana Ross follow, completing the first chorus together. <a href="Dionne%20Warwick">Dionne Warwick</a>, <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a>, and <a href="Al%20Jarreau">Al Jarreau</a> sing the second verse, before <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href="Kenny%20Loggins">Kenny Loggins</a>, <a href="Steve%20Perry">Steve Perry</a>, and <a href="Daryl%20Hall">Daryl Hall</a> go through the second chorus. Co-writer Jackson, <a href="Huey%20Lewis">Huey Lewis</a>, <a href="Cyndi%20Lauper">Cyndi Lauper</a>, and <a href="Kim%20Carnes">Kim Carnes</a> follow with the song's bridge. This structuring of the song is said to "create a sense of continuous surprise and emotional buildup". "We Are the World" concludes with Bob Dylan and Ray Charles singing a full chorus, Wonder and Springsteen duetting, and <a href="ad%20libitum">ad libs</a> from Charles and Ingram.

On March 8, 1985, "We Are the World" was released as a single, in both <a href="7%26quot%3B">7"</a> and <a href="12%26quot%3B">12"</a> format. The song was the only one released from the "We Are the World" album and became a chart success around the world. In the US, it was a number one hit on the <a href="R%26amp%3BB%20singles%20chart">R&B singles chart</a>, the <a href="Hot%20Adult%20Contemporary%20Tracks">Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks</a> chart and the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, where it remained for a month. The single had initially debuted at number 21 on the Hot 100, the highest entry since Michael Jackson's "<a href="Thriller%20%28song%29">Thriller</a>" entered the charts at number 20 the year before. It took four weeks for the song to claim the number one spot—half the time a single would normally have taken to reach its charting peak. On the Hot 100, the song moved from 21 to 5 to 2 and then number 1. "We Are the World" might have reached the top of the Hot 100 chart sooner, if it were not for the success of <a href="Phil%20Collins">Phil Collins</a>' "<a href="One%20More%20Night%20%28Phil%20Collins%20song%29">One More Night</a>", which received a significant level of support from both pop and rock listeners. "We Are the World" also entered "Billboard"s Top Rock Tracks and Hot Country Singles charts, where it peaked at numbers 27 and 76 respectively. The song became the first single since <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%28song%29">Let It Be</a>" to enter "Billboard"s Top 5 within two weeks of release. Outside of the US, the single reached number one in Australia, France, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The song peaked at number 2 in only two countries: Germany and Austria.

The single was also a commercial success: the initial shipment of 800,000 "We Are the World" records sold out within three days of release. The record became the fastest-selling American pop single in history. At one <a href="Tower%20Records%20%28music%20retailer%29">Tower Records</a> store on Sunset Boulevard in <a href="West%20Hollywood">West Hollywood</a>, 1,000 copies of the song were sold in two days. Store worker Richard Petitpas commented, "A number one single sells about 100 to 125 copies a week. This is absolutely unheard of." By the end of 1985, "We Are the World" had become the best selling single of the year. Five years later it was revealed that the song had become the biggest single of the 1980s. "We Are the World" was eventually cited as the biggest selling single in both US and pop music history. The song became the first-ever single to be certified multi-platinum; it received a 4× certification by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>. The estimated global sales of "We Are the World" are said to be 20 million.

Despite the song's commercial success, "We Are the World" received mixed reviews from journalists, music critics and the public following its release. American journalist <a href="Greil%20Marcus">Greil Marcus</a> felt that the song sounded like a <a href="Pepsi">Pepsi</a> jingle. He wrote, "... the constant repetition of 'There's a choice we're making' conflates with Pepsi's trademarked 'The choice of a new generation' in a way that, on the part of Pepsi-contracted song writers Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, is certainly not intentional, and even more certainly beyond the realm of serendipity." Marcus added, "In the realm of contextualization, 'We Are the World' says less about Ethiopia than it does about Pepsi—and the true result will likely be less that certain Ethiopian individuals will live, or anyway live a bit longer than they otherwise would have, than that Pepsi will get the catch phrase of its advertising campaign sung for free by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, and all the rest." Professor and activist Reebee Garofalo agreed, and expressed the opinion that the line "We're saving our own lives" was a "distasteful element of self-indulgence". He asserted that the artists of USA for Africa were proclaiming "their own salvation for singing about an issue they will never experience on behalf of a people most of them will never encounter".

In contrast, <a href="Stephen%20Holden">Stephen Holden</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" praised the phrase "There's a choice we're making, We're saving our own lives". He commented that the line assumed "an extra emotional dimension when sung by people with superstar mystiques". Holden expressed that the song was "an artistic triumph that transcends its official nature". He noted that unlike Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas", the vocals on "We Are the World" were "artfully interwoven" and emphasized the individuality of each singer. Holden concluded that "We Are the World" was "a simple, eloquent ballad" and a "realized pop statement that would sound outstanding even if it weren't recorded by stars".

The song proved popular with both young and old listeners. The public enjoyed hearing a supergroup of musicians singing together on one track, and felt satisfied in buying the record, knowing that the money would go towards a good cause. People reported they bought more than one copy of the single, some buying up to five copies of the record. 

According to music critic and Bruce Springsteen biographer <a href="Dave%20Marsh">Dave Marsh</a>, "We Are the World" was not widely accepted within the rock music community. The author revealed that the song was "despised" for what it was not: "a rock record, a critique of the political policies that created the famine, a way of finding out how and why famines occur, an all-inclusive representation of the entire worldwide spectrum of post-<a href="Elvis%20Presley">Presley</a> popular music". Marsh revealed that he felt some of the criticisms were right, while others were silly. He claimed that despite the sentimentality of the song, "We Are the World" was a large-scale pop event with serious political overtones.

"We Are the World" was recognized with several awards following its release. At the <a href="Grammy%20Awards%20of%201986">1986 Grammy Awards</a>, the song and its accompanying music video won four awards: <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Record%20of%20the%20Year">Record of the Year</a>, <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Song%20of%20the%20Year">Song of the Year</a>, <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Performance%20by%20a%20Duo%20or%20Group%20with%20Vocal">Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Short%20Form%20Music%20Video">Best Music Video, Short Form</a>. The music video was awarded two honors at the 1985 <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">MTV Video Music Awards</a>. It collected the awards for Best Group Video and Viewer's Choice. <a href="People%27s%20Choice%20Awards">People's Choice Awards</a> recognized "We Are the World" with the Favorite New Song award in 1986. In the same year, the American Music Awards named "We Are the World" "Song of the Year", and honored organizer Harry Belafonte with the Award of Appreciation. Collecting his award, Belafonte thanked Ken Kragen, Quincy Jones, and "the two artists who, without their great gift would not have inspired us in quite the same way as we were inspired, Mr. Lionel Richie and Mr. Michael Jackson". Following the speech, the majority of USA for Africa reunited on stage, closing the ceremony with "We Are the World".

One mother from <a href="Columbia%2C%20Missouri">Columbia, Missouri</a> purchased two copies of "We Are the World", stating:

"We Are the World" was promoted with a music video, a video cassette, and several other items made available to the public, including books, posters, shirts and buttons. All proceeds from the sale of official USA for Africa merchandise went directly to the famine relief fund. All of the merchandise sold well; the video cassette—entitled "We Are the World: The Video Event"—documented the making of the song, and became the ninth best-selling home video of 1985. All of the video elements were produced by <a href="Howard%20G.%20Malley">Howard G. Malley</a> and Craig B. Golin along with April Lee Grebb as the production supervisor.

The music video showed the recording of "We Are the World", and drew criticism from some. Michael Jackson joked before filming, "People will know it's me as soon as they see the socks. Try taking footage of Bruce Springsteen's socks and see if anyone knows who they belong to." Jackson was also criticized for filming and recording his solo piece privately, away from the other artists.

The song was also promoted with a special edition of the American magazine "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>". The publication had been the only media outlet permitted inside A&M Recording Studios on the night of January 28, 1985. All other press organizations were barred from reporting the events leading up to and during "We Are the World"'s recording. "Life" ran a cover story of the recording session in its April 1985 edition of the monthly magazine. Seven members of USA for Africa were pictured on the cover: Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Cyndi Lauper, Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Willie Nelson. Inside the magazine were photographs of the "We Are the World" participants working and taking breaks.

"We Are the World" received worldwide radio coverage in the form of an international simultaneous broadcast later that year. Upon spinning the song on their local stations, Georgia radio disc jockeys, Bob Wolf and Don Briscar came up with the idea for a worldwide simulcast. They called hundreds of radio and satellite stations asking them to participate. On the morning of April 5, 1985 (<a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a> of that year) at 3:50 pm GMT, over 8000 radio stations simultaneously broadcast the song around the world. As the song was broadcast, hundreds of people sang along on the steps of <a href="St.%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20New%20York">St. Patrick's Cathedral</a> in New York. A year later on March 28, 1986 (Good Friday of that year), the simultaneous radio broadcast of "We Are the World" was repeated over 6,000 radio stations worldwide.

"We Are the World" gained further promotion and coverage on May 25, 1986, when it was played during a major benefit event held throughout the US. <a href="Hands%20Across%20America">Hands Across America</a>—USA for Africa's follow-up project—was an event in which millions of people formed a <a href="human%20chain">human chain</a> across the US. The event was held to draw attention to hunger and <a href="homelessness%20in%20the%20United%20States">homelessness in the United States</a>. "We Are the World"'s co-writer, Michael Jackson, had wanted his song to be the official theme for the event. The other board members of USA for Africa outvoted him, and it was instead decided that a new song would be created and released for the event, titled "Hands Across America". When released, the new song did not achieve the level of success that "We Are the World" did, and the decision to use it as the official theme for the event led to Jackson—who co-owned the publishing rights to "We Are the World"—resigning from the board of directors of USA for Africa.

Four months after the release of "We Are the World", USA for Africa had taken in almost $10.8 million (equivalent to $ million today). The majority of the money came from record sales within the US. Members of the public also donated money—almost $1.3 million within the same time period. In May 1985, USA for Africa officials estimated that they had sold between $45 million and $47 million worth of official merchandise around the world. Organizer Ken Kragen announced that they would not be distributing all of the money at once. Instead, he revealed that the foundation would be looking into finding a long-term solution for Africa's problems. "We could go out and spend it all in one shot. Maybe we'd save some lives in the short term but it would be like putting a Band-Aid over a serious wound." Kragen noted that experts had predicted that it would take at least 10 to 20 years to make a slight difference to Africa's long-term problems.

In June 1985, the first USA for Africa cargo jet carrying food, medicine, and clothing departed for Ethiopia and <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>. It stopped "en route" in New York, where 15,000 T-shirts were added to the cargo. Included in the supplies were high-protein biscuits, high-protein vitamins, medicine, tents, blankets and refrigeration equipment. Harry Belafonte, representing the USA for Africa musicians, visited Sudan in the same month. The trip was his last stop on a four-nation tour of Africa. Tanzanian Prime Minister <a href="Salim%20Ahmed%20Salim">Salim Ahmed Salim</a> greeted and praised Belafonte, telling him, "I personally and the people of <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> are moved by this tremendous example of human solidarity."
One year after the release of "We Are the World", organizers noted that $44.5 million had been raised for USA for Africa's humanitarian fund. They stated that they were confident that they would reach an initial set target of $50 million (equivalent to $ million in 2019). By October 1986, it was revealed that their $50 million target had been met and exceeded; <a href="Sony%20Music">CBS Records</a> gave USA for Africa a check for $2.5 million, drawing the total amount of money to $51.2 million. USA for Africa's Hands Across America event had also raised a significant amount of money—approximately $24.5 million for the hungry in the US.

Since its release, "We Are the World" has raised over $63 million (equivalent to $ million today) for humanitarian causes. Ninety percent of the money was pledged to African relief, both long and short term. The long-term initiative included efforts in birth control and food production. The remaining 10 percent of funds was earmarked for domestic hunger and homeless programs in the US. From the African fund, over 70 recovery and development projects were launched in seven African nations. Such projects included aid in agriculture, fishing, water management, manufacturing and reforestation. Training programs were also developed in the African countries of <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, Senegal, <a href="Chad">Chad</a>, Mauritania, <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, and <a href="Mali">Mali</a>.

Elias Kifle Maraim Beyene, a survivor from Ethiopia being asked about his memory of Michael Jackson after his death remembers:
"We Are the World" has been performed live by members of USA for Africa on several occasions both together and individually. One of the earliest such performances came in 1985, during the rock music concert <a href="Live%20Aid">Live Aid</a>, which ended with more than 100 musicians singing the song on stage. Harry Belafonte and Lionel Richie made surprise appearances for the live rendition of the song. Michael Jackson would have joined the artists, but was "working around the clock in the studio on a project that he's made a major commitment to", according to his press agent, Norman Winter.

An inaugural celebration was held for US <a href="President-elect">President-elect</a> <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> in January 1993. The event was staged by Clinton's Hollywood friends at the <a href="Lincoln%20Memorial">Lincoln Memorial</a> and drew hundreds of thousands of people. <a href="Aretha%20Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a>, <a href="LL%20Cool%20J">LL Cool J</a>, <a href="Michael%20Bolton">Michael Bolton</a> and <a href="Tony%20Bennett">Tony Bennett</a> were among some of the musicians in attendance. Said Jones, "I've never seen so many great performers come together with so much love and selflessness." The celebration included a performance of "We Are the World", which involved Clinton, his daughter <a href="Chelsea%20Clinton">Chelsea</a>, and his wife <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary</a> singing the song along with USA for Africa's Kenny Rogers, Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. "The New York Times" <a href="Edward%20Rothstein">Edward Rothstein</a> commented on the event, stating, "The most enduring image may be of Mr. Clinton singing along in 'We Are the World', the first President to aspire, however futilely, to hipness."

As a prelude to his song "<a href="Heal%20the%20World">Heal the World</a>", "We Are the World" was performed as an interlude during two of Michael Jackson's tours, the <a href="Dangerous%20World%20Tour">Dangerous World Tour</a> from 1992 to 1993 and the <a href="HIStory%20World%20Tour">HIStory World Tour</a> from 1996 to 1997. Jackson briefly perform the song with a chorus at the 2006 World Music Award in London, in his last live public performance. Jackson planned to use the song for his <a href="This%20Is%20It%20%28concerts%29">This Is It</a> comeback concerts at <a href="The%20O2%20Arena">The O2 Arena</a> in <a href="London">London</a> from 2009 to 2010, but the shows were cancelled due to his sudden death.

<a href="Death%20of%20Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson died</a> in June 2009, after suffering a cardiac arrest. <a href="Michael%20Jackson%20memorial%20service">His memorial service</a> was held several days later on July 7, and was reported to have been viewed by more than three billion people. The finale of the event featured group renditions of the Jackson anthems "We Are the World" and "<a href="Heal%20the%20World">Heal the World</a>". The singalong of "We Are the World" was led by Darryl Phinnessee, who had worked with Jackson since the late 1980s. It also featured co-writer Lionel Richie and Jackson's family, including his children. Following the performance, "We Are the World" re-entered the US charts for the first time since its 1985 release. The song debuted at number 50 on "Billboard" <a href="Hot%20Digital%20Songs">Hot Digital Songs</a> chart.

On January 12, 2010, <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a> was struck by a <a href="moment%20magnitude%20scale">magnitude</a>-7.0 <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">earthquake</a>, the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The epicenter of the quake was just outside the Haitian capital <a href="Port-au-Prince">Port-au-Prince</a>. Over 230,000 civilians have been confirmed dead by the Haitian government because of the disaster and around 300,000 have been injured. Approximately 1.2 million people are homeless and it has been reported that the lack of temporary shelter may lead to the outbreak of disease.

To raise money for earthquake victims, a new celebrity version of "We Are the World" was recorded on February 1, 2010, and released on February 12, 2010. Over 75 musicians were involved in the remake, which was recorded in the same studio as the 1985 original. The new version features revised lyrics as well as a rap segment pertaining to Haiti. Michael Jackson's younger sister <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet</a> duets with her late brother on the track, as per a request from their mother <a href="Katherine%20Jackson">Katherine</a>. In the video and on the track, archive material of Michael Jackson is used from the original 1985 recording.

On February 20, 2010, a non-celebrity remake, "<a href="We%20Are%20the%20World%2025%20for%20Haiti%20%28YouTube%20Edition%29">We Are the World 25 for Haiti (YouTube Edition)</a>", was posted to the video sharing website YouTube. <a href="List%20of%20YouTube%20personalities">Internet personality</a> and singer-songwriter <a href="Lisa%20Lavie">Lisa Lavie</a> conceived and organized the Internet collaboration of 57 <a href="unsigned%20artist">unsigned</a> or <a href="independent%20record%20label">independent</a> YouTube musicians geographically distributed around the world. Lavie's 2010 YouTube version, a <a href="cover%20version">cover</a> of the 1985 original, excludes the rap segment and minimizes the <a href="Auto-tune">Auto-tune</a> that characterizes the 2010 celebrity remake. Another 2010 remake of the original is the Spanish-language "<a href="Somos%20El%20Mundo">Somos El Mundo</a>". It was written by <a href="Emilio%20Estefan">Emilio Estefan</a> and his wife <a href="Gloria%20Estefan">Gloria Estefan</a>, and produced by Emilio, Quincy Jones and <a href="Univision%20Communications">Univision Communications</a>, the company that funded the project.

"We Are the World" has been recognized as a politically important song, which "affected an international focus on Africa that was simply unprecedented". It has been credited with creating a climate in which musicians from around the world felt inclined to follow. According to "The New York Times" Stephen Holden, since the release of "We Are the World", it has been noted that movement has been made within popular music to create songs that address humanitarian concerns. "We Are the World" was also influential in subverting the way music and meaning were produced, showing that musically and racially diverse musicians could work together both productively and creatively. "<a href="Ebony%20%28magazine%29">Ebony</a>" described the January 28 recording session, in which Quincy Jones brought together a multi-racial group, as being "a major moment in world music that showed we can change the world". "We Are the World", along with <a href="Live%20Aid">Live Aid</a> and <a href="Farm%20Aid">Farm Aid</a>, demonstrated that rock music had become more than entertainment, but a political and social movement. Journalist Robert Palmer noted that such songs and events had the ability to reach people around the world, send them a message, and then get results.

Since the release of "We Are the World", and the Band Aid single that influenced it, numerous songs have been recorded in a similar fashion, with the intent to aid disaster victims throughout the world. One such example involved a supergroup of Latin musicians billed as "Hermanos del Tercer Mundo", or "Brothers of the Third World". Among the supergroup of 62 recording artists were <a href="Julio%20Iglesias">Julio Iglesias</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Feliciano">José Feliciano</a>, and <a href="S%C3%A9rgio%20Mendes">Sérgio Mendes</a>. Their famine relief song was recorded in the same studio as "We Are the World". Half of the profits raised from the charity single was pledged to USA for Africa. The rest of the money was to be used for impoverished Latin American countries. Another notable example is the 1989 cover of the <a href="Deep%20Purple">Deep Purple</a> song "<a href="Smoke%20on%20the%20Water">Smoke on the Water</a>" by a supergroup of hard rock, prog rock, and heavy metal musicians collaborating as <a href="Rock%20Aid%20Armenia">Rock Aid Armenia</a> to raise money for victims of the devastating <a href="1988%20Armenian%20earthquake">1988 Armenian earthquake</a>.

The 20th anniversary of "We Are the World" was celebrated in 2005. Radio stations around the world paid homage to USA for Africa's creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by the release of a two-disc DVD called "We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song". Ken Kragen asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA for Africa to praise themselves for doing a good job, but to "use it to do some more good [for the original charity]. That's all we care about accomplishing." Harry Belafonte also commented on the 20th anniversary of the song. He acknowledged that "We Are the World" had "stood the test of time"; anyone old enough to remember it can still at least hum along.

U.S. Route 141

US Highway 141 (US 141) is a north–south <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway">United States Numbered Highway</a> in the states of <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. The highway runs north-northwesterly from an interchange with <a href="Interstate%2043">Interstate 43</a> (I-43) in <a href="Bellevue%2C%20Wisconsin">Bellevue, Wisconsin</a>, near <a href="Green%20Bay%2C%20Wisconsin">Green Bay</a>, to a junction with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Michigan">US 41</a>/<a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-28</a> near <a href="Covington%2C%20Michigan">Covington, Michigan</a>. In between, it follows city streets in Green Bay and has a <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrent</a> section with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Wisconsin">US 41 in Wisconsin</a>. North of Green Bay, US 141 is either a <a href="freeway">freeway</a> or an <a href="Limited-access%20road">expressway</a> into rural northern Wisconsin before downgrading to an <a href="undivided%20highway">undivided highway</a>. In Michigan, US 141 is an undivided highway that runs through rural woodlands. The highway has two segments in each state; after running through Wisconsin for about , it crosses into Michigan for approximately another . After that, it crosses back into Wisconsin for about before crossing the state line one last time. The northernmost Michigan section is about , making the overall length about .

When the US Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, US 141 ran from <a href="Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">Milwaukee</a> to Green Bay, and one segment of the modern highway in Michigan was originally designated US 102. This other designation was <a href="decommissioned%20highway">decommissioned</a> in 1928 when US 141 was extended north from Green Bay into Michigan. Michigan has rebuilt the highway in stages over the years to smooth out sharp curves in the routing. Since the 1960s, the section south of Green Bay has been converted into a freeway in segments. US 141 has ended southeast of Green Bay in Bellevue since the 1980s—the southern freeway segment was redesignated as I-43. The section north of <a href="Abrams%2C%20Wisconsin">Abrams, Wisconsin</a>, was converted to a freeway in the opening years of the 21st century, with an additional divided-highway section opening a few years later.

As a bi-state highway, US 141 is a <a href="Wisconsin%20State%20Highway%20system">state trunk highway</a> in Wisconsin and a <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> in Michigan. In Wisconsin, the segment through the Green Bay area is not on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a> (NHS), except for about four blocks along Broadway Avenue that is part of an <a href="Intermodal%20freight%20transport">intermodal connector</a> with the Port of Green Bay. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. From the Green Bay suburb of <a href="Howard%2C%20Wisconsin">Howard</a> northward, including the entire length through Michigan, US 141 is a part of the NHS. From the I-43 interchange in Howard north to the split at Abrams, US 141 is also a part of the <a href="Lake%20Michigan%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Michigan Circle Tour</a> (LMCT), a tourist route that surrounds <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>.

US 141 starts at an interchange with I-43 southeast of Green Bay in the suburb of Bellevue. From the terminus at exit 178, US 141 runs north to Main Street, and then northwesterly along Main Street through town. <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B29">Wisconsin Highway 29</a> (WIS 29) merges with US 141 at an intersection on the northwest side of Bellevue, and the two highways <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">run concurrently</a> through residential subdivisions. Main Street passes over I-43 and continues to the north and into the city of Green Bay. US 141/WIS 29 crosses Baird Creek and runs along the banks of the <a href="East%20River%20%28Wisconsin%29">East River</a>. At the intersection with Monroe Avenue, WIS 29 turns south, joining <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2054">WIS 54</a>/<a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2057">WIS 57</a> while US 141 continues westward on Main Street to cross the <a href="Fox%20River%20%28Wisconsin%29">Fox River</a> on the <a href="Ray%20Nitschke%20Memorial%20Bridge">Ray Nitschke Memorial Bridge</a>. On the west side of the river, the highway follows Dousman Street for a block before turning north along Broadway Avenue for four blocks. From there, the highway follows Mather Street west to Velp Avenue. US 141 follows that street northwesterly and parallel to I-43 on the north side of Green Bay. This area is mostly residential with some businesses immediately on either side. In the suburb of Howard, US 141 merges onto the US 41 <a href="freeway">freeway</a> via the interchange at exit 170. US 41/US 141 has an interchange for I-43 just south of the Duck Creek crossing.

From Howard northward, the freeway runs through suburban <a href="Brown%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Brown County</a> to <a href="Suamico%2C%20Wisconsin">Suamico</a>, parallel to a line of the <a href="Escanaba%20and%20Lake%20Superior%20Railroad">Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad</a> (ELS), through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions. There are <a href="frontage%20road">frontage road</a>s on both sides of the freeway to provide access to the properties immediately adjacent to US 41/US 141. There are a number of interchanges with county-maintained roads between Suamico and <a href="Abrams%2C%20Wisconsin">Abrams</a> in <a href="Oconto%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Oconto County</a>. At Abrams, US 141 splits from US 41 and heads northward while the latter freeway turns northeasterly. The landscape north of the split transitions to forest, and the freeway crosses the <a href="Oconto%20River">Oconto River</a> in <a href="Stiles%2C%20Wisconsin">Stiles</a> south of the interchange with <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2022">WIS 22</a>. The freeway bypasses <a href="Lena%2C%20Wisconsin">Lena</a> to the east and continues north through mixed farm fields and forest to the county line. North of the line, US 141 continues to the <a href="Marinette%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Marinette County</a> communities of <a href="Coleman%2C%20Wisconsin">Coleman</a> and <a href="Pound%2C%20Wisconsin">Pound</a> as an <a href="Limited-access%20road">expressway</a>. Through Coleman and Pound there is also a <a href="U.S.%20Route%20141%20Business%20%28Coleman%2C%20Wisconsin%29">Business US 141</a>. Past the latter town, US 141 transitions from expressway to a two-lane undivided highway.
South of <a href="Crivitz%2C%20Wisconsin">Crivitz</a>, US 141 crosses the <a href="Peshtigo%20River">Peshtigo River</a>. The highway crosses a branch line of the ELS on the east side of Crivitz and continues north through woodland to the community of <a href="Middle%20Inlet%2C%20Wisconsin">Middle Inlet</a>. North of town, the roadway turns northeasterly to the community of <a href="Wausaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">Wausaukee</a> where it intersects <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%20180">WIS 180</a>. From there, the highway passes through the communities of <a href="Amberg%2C%20Wisconsin">Amberg</a> and <a href="Beecher%2C%20Wisconsin">Beecher</a> before coming into <a href="Pembine%2C%20Wisconsin">Pembine</a>, where <a href="U.S.%20Route%208">US 8</a> merges in from the west. The two highways run concurrently north and northeasterly to an intersection southeast of <a href="Niagara%2C%20Wisconsin">Niagara</a>. US 8 separates to the east, and US 141 turns northwestly along River Street into Niagara. The highway then turns north along Roosevelt Road and over the <a href="Menominee%20River">Menominee River</a> to exit the state of Wisconsin.

Once in Michigan, west of <a href="Quinnesec%2C%20Michigan">Quinnesec</a>, US 141 meets and joins <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a>. The two highways run concurrently westward into <a href="Iron%20Mountain%2C%20Michigan">Iron Mountain</a> along Stephenson Avenue, passing through a retail business corridor and into downtown. <a href="M-95%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-95</a> joins the two highways, and all three pass Lake Antoine. M-95 turns off north of town and US 2/US 141 crosses the Menominee River back into Wisconsin.

US 2/US 141 makes a run through <a href="Florence%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Florence County</a>, passing the Spread Eagle Chain of Lakes. The highway serves the communities of <a href="Spread%20Eagle%2C%20Wisconsin">Spread Eagle</a> and <a href="Florence%20%28CDP%29%2C%20Wisconsin">Florence</a>. The only junction with another state trunk highway in Wisconsin on the northern section is with the concurrent highways <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2070">WIS 70</a> / <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%20101">WIS 101</a> in Florence. The highway crosses back into Michigan on a bridge over the <a href="Brule%20River">Brule River</a> south of <a href="Crystal%20Falls%2C%20Michigan">Crystal Falls</a>.
Across the state line, the trunkline runs through forest near several smaller bodies of water such as Stager, Kennedy and Railroad lakes. The highway enters Crystal Falls on 5th Street. US 2/US 141 runs along the top of the hill in town and intersects the western terminus of <a href="M-69%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-69</a> next to the <a href="Iron%20County%20Courthouse%20%28Crystal%20Falls%2C%20Michigan%29">Iron County Courthouse</a>. US 141 continues westward on Crystal Avenue and separates from the US 2 concurrency on the western edge of town. Running north and northwesterly, US 141 passes to the east of the <a href="Ottawa%20National%20Forest">Ottawa National Forest</a> through rural <a href="Iron%20County%2C%20Michigan">Iron County</a>. The highway crosses the <a href="Paint%20River">Paint River</a> and continues through forest to the community of <a href="Amasa%2C%20Michigan">Amasa</a>. The trunkline crosses the <a href="Hemlock%20River">Hemlock River</a> on the west side of town. From there, US 141 runs northward into the southwest corner of <a href="Baraga%20County%2C%20Michigan">Baraga County</a> and also enters the <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Time Zone</a>. West of Worm Lake, US 141 meets <a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-28</a> in the community of Covington. The two highways merge and run easterly for about before US 141 terminates at US 41; M-28 continues eastward, merging with US 41.

In 1918, when Wisconsin initially numbered its highway system, the route of what later became US 141 followed two separate state highways: <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2017">WIS 17</a> from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2016">WIS 16</a> from Manitowoc north to Green Bay. Segments that later became US 141 in Wisconsin were numbered <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2015">WIS 15</a> between Green Bay and Abrams, and <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2038">WIS 38</a> between Abrams and Wausaukee. North of Wausaukee, the future US Highway was an unnumbered secondary highway. In 1919, Michigan signed its highway system, but the state did not have a highway running south from Quinnesec to the state line. The highway from Quinnesec into Iron Mountain was part of <a href="M-12%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-12</a>. The segment through Florence County, Wisconsin, was <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2069">WIS 69</a>, and from the Crystal Falls area north to Covington, the <a href="M-69%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-69</a> moniker was used. In 1919, the WIS 38 designation was extended northward to Niagara and the state line. The highway was straightened to eliminate a series of sharp curves between Crivitz and Beaver in 1921. The same year, WIS 17 was realigned between Sheboygan and Cedar Grove to run via Oostburg. WIS 17 was also realigned in 1922 to follow a separate routing south of Port Washington; previously it was routed concurrently with WIS 57 in the area. By 1924, maps showed an unnumbered roadway running south from Quinnesec to connect with WIS 57 at the state line.

As originally proposed in 1925, several US Highways in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula were to be designated. However, the routings for two highways were different in Michigan in 1925 than on the final 1926 map. In the original plan, US 102 was supposed to replace <a href="M-15%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-15</a> from US 2 at <a href="Rapid%20River%2C%20Michigan">Rapid River</a>, continue via <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a> to <a href="Humboldt%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Humboldt</a>, and the highway between Crystal Falls and Covington was not included in the system. However, when the final plan was approved and implemented on November 11, 1926, US 41 took the eastern routing through Rapid River and Marquette, and US 102 was routed between Crystal Falls and Covington. In both plans, US 141 was only routed between Milwaukee and Green Bay, replacing WIS 17 and WIS 16. At the time the two US Highways were created, WIS 57 was left untouched between Abrams and Niagara. The next year, the <a href="M-57%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-57</a> designation was assigned to connect WIS 57 to Quinnesec, and US 8 was extended to follow US 141 to US 2 near Iron Mountain.

By September 20, 1928, the extension of US 141 northward from Green Bay along WIS 57 to the Michigan state line had been approved, and the signage was readied for installation the following month. The US 102 designation was <a href="decommissioned%20highway">decommissioned</a> when US 141 was also extended to replace M-57 from the state line, along US 2 to Crystal Falls and north to Covington. US 8's eastern end was rerouted along a separate bridge over the Menominee River to a new terminus at an intersection with US 2 in <a href="Norway%2C%20Michigan">Norway</a> in 1929. US 141 was fully paved in Wisconsin in the early 1930s; the last segment to be completed was between Pound and Abrams.

The next major changes were made at the beginning of the 1930s in Michigan. A realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2/US 141 to a new bridge over the Menominee River between 1932 and 1934. In 1940, a new routing from the state line north to Crystal Falls was opened; the previous routing was returned to local control. The northern end was relocated near Covington in late 1948 or early 1949 when US 41 was realigned in the area. This terminus was shifted again when US 141/M-28 was realigned in the area in late 1955 or early 1956.

At about the same time as the realignments in Michigan, two-lane bypasses of Manitowoc and <a href="Port%20Washington%2C%20Wisconsin">Port Washington</a> in Wisconsin were opened in 1957. The state built a <a href="divided-highway">divided-highway</a> segment that opened the following year running from the Milwaukee area northward to the <a href="Ozaukee%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Ozaukee</a>–<a href="Milwaukee%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Milwaukee</a> county line. The highway was rerouted to run further inland, bypassing <a href="Haven%2C%20Wisconsin">Haven, Wisconsin</a>, in 1959. In late 1961, the highway in Michigan was rebuilt in northern Iron and southern Baraga counties between Amasa and Covington as the state smoothed out sharp corners in the routing and finished paving US 141; a similar project was completed in 1972 south of Amasa to Crystal Falls.

Wisconsin proposed an addition to the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> in the 1950s to connect Green Bay, the state's third-largest city, to the system. Variations on this proposal included using either the US 41 or US 141 corridors, or a new corridor in between. This request was rejected in the 1950s, but it was approved in the 1960s. After approval, the state started the process to convert US 141 between Milwaukee and Abrams into a freeway. The first segments of freeway were opened in the Milwaukee area, starting in 1963 between Locust Street and Good Hope Road. The following year, an extension of the freeway opened southward from Locust to North Avenue. By 1965, the bypass of <a href="Sheboygan%2C%20Wisconsin">Sheboygan</a> was opened; the Milwaukee area freeway was extended northward to Brown Deer Road the following year. Another freeway segment in the Milwaukee area opened in 1967, extending northward to <a href="Grafton%2C%20Wisconsin">Grafton</a> in Ozaukee County. The last section of US 141 in the city of Milwaukee to open as a freeway was completed in 1968 when <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Wisconsin">I-94</a> was finished through downtown; at the same time, US 141 was extended southward from North Avenue to meet I-94.
Another freeway section from north of Green Bay to Suamico was opened in 1971. In 1972, the divided-highway segment between Suamico and Abrams opened, and the state started the construction of additional freeways between Green Bay and Milwaukee. The bypasses of Sheboygan and <a href="Cedar%20Grove%2C%20Wisconsin">Cedar Grove</a> were converted to full freeways in 1973. Another segment of freeway opened in 1975 that bypassed Port Washington and connected the freeway sections that ended near Grafton and Cedar Grove. I-43 was first designated on the 1978 official state highway map along US 141 from Milwaukee to Sheboygan; missing segments of I-43 between Green Bay and Milwaukee are shown as either under construction or proposed. In November of that year, the section bypassing <a href="Maribel%2C%20Wisconsin">Maribel</a> opened. In October 1980, the segment of freeway between Sheboygan and <a href="Denmark%2C%20Wisconsin">Denmark</a> opened. At the same time, the northern bypass of Green Bay was under construction and I-43/US 141 was open from <a href="Maribel%2C%20Wisconsin">Maribel</a> to <a href="Branch%2C%20Wisconsin">Branch</a> northwest of Manitowoc; US 141 was truncated to end at the northern end of the Sheboygan bypass. I-43 was initially completed in 1981, and the southern terminus of US 141 was moved again, truncating the highway to end in Bellevue by 1983.

In 1986, the states in the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region%20%28North%20America%29">Great Lakes region</a> created the LMCT as part of a larger program of tourist routes in the region; US 141 carries the LMCT between the northern I-43 junction in the Green Bay area north to the split with US 41 at Abrams. In the first years of the 21st century, US 141 was expanded to a four-lane expressway northward from Abrams to Oconto Falls. A further upgrade in 2006 expanded the highway to four-lanes northward to Beaver. On April 7, 2015, the segment of US 141 that runs concurrently with US 41 on the west side of Green Bay designated a part of <a href="Interstate%2041">I-41</a> by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>.

Business U.S. Highway 141 (Bus. US 141) is a <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a> of US 141 that runs through the communities of <a href="Coleman%2C%20Wisconsin">Coleman</a> and <a href="Pound%2C%20Wisconsin">Pound</a>. The loop follows County Trunk Highway B (CTH-B) northeasterly from the US 141 expressway into downtown Coleman and then turns northward near Coleman High School. Bus. US 141 continues northward into Pound, crossing the <a href="Peshtigo%20River">Peshtigo River</a> in between the two communities. North of Pound, the loop crosses over US 141 on 21st Road and continues to an intersection with <a href="Wisconsin%20Highway%2064">WIS 64</a>. The business loop follows WIS 64 back to an interchange on US 141 northwest of Pound where the loop terminates.

In 2006, the US 141 expressway was extended northward near <a href="Beaver%20%28community%29%2C%20Marinette%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Beaver</a>, and the former route of US 141, plus a connector roadway southwest of downtown Coleman was designated as a business loop. This route does not appear on the official <a href="Wisconsin%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Wisconsin Department of Transportation</a> maps, so it is a locally designated business loop under local maintenance.

M-185 (Michigan highway)

M-185 is a <a href="Michigan%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> that circles <a href="Mackinac%20Island">Mackinac Island</a>, a popular tourist destination on the <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a> side of the <a href="Straits%20of%20Mackinac">Straits of Mackinac</a>, along the island's shoreline. A narrow paved road of , it offers scenic views of the straits that divide the <a href="Upper%20peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper</a> and the <a href="Lower%20peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower</a> peninsulas of Michigan and Lakes Huron and <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Michigan</a>. It has no connection to any other Michigan state trunkline highways—as it is on an island—and is accessible only by passenger ferry. The <a href="Mackinac%20Island%2C%20Michigan">City of Mackinac Island</a>, which shares jurisdiction over the island with the <a href="Mackinac%20Island%20State%20Park%20Commission">Mackinac Island State Park Commission</a> (MISPC), calls the highway Main Street within the built-up area on the island's southeast quadrant, and Lake Shore Road elsewhere. M-185 passes by several important sites within <a href="Mackinac%20Island%20State%20Park">Mackinac Island State Park</a>, including <a href="Fort%20Mackinac">Fort Mackinac</a>, <a href="Arch%20Rock%20%28Mackinac%20Island%29">Arch Rock</a>, <a href="British%20Landing">British Landing</a>, and <a href="Devil%27s%20Kitchen%20%28cave%29">Devil's Kitchen</a>. Lake Shore Road carries the highway next to the Lake Huron shoreline, running between the water's edge and woodlands outside the downtown area.

According to the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT), M-185 is "the only state highway in the nation where motor vehicles are banned". Traffic on it is by foot, on horse, by <a href="horse-drawn%20vehicle">horse-drawn vehicle</a>, or by bicycle. Restrictions on automobiles date back to the 1890s, and since the ban, only a few vehicles have been permitted on the island other than the city's emergency vehicles. The highway was built during the first decade of the 20th century by the state and designated as a state highway in 1933. The highway was paved in the 1950s, and portions were rebuilt to deal with shoreline erosion in the 1980s. Until an accident in 2005, it was the only state highway without any automobile accidents.

As a <a href="Ring%20road">circular highway</a>, M-185 has no specific termini; the generally accepted starting point is at the mile 0 marker placed in front of the <a href="Mackinac%20Island%20State%20Park">Mackinac Island State Park</a> Visitor Center. The highway uses wooden markers to measure miles instead of the common metal signage; these signs are erected by the MISPC, as MDOT does not install the standard <a href="highway%20shield">state highway reassurance markers</a> along this roadway. M-185 is one of only three state trunkline highways in Michigan on islands; the others are <a href="M-134%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-134</a> on <a href="Drummond%20Island">Drummond Island</a> and <a href="M-154%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-154</a> on <a href="Harsens%20Island">Harsens Island</a>. No part of M-185 has been listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Over a half million people travel along the trunkline in a year.

Mackinac Island has been a tourist destination since the late 19th century. The island was the country's <a href="Mackinac%20National%20Park">second national park</a>, after <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone</a>, until the land was given to Michigan in 1895 to become its first state park. M-185 has been recognized in the press for its unique role as the only state highway without car traffic in the United States by such publications as the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", "<a href="The%20Kansas%20City%20Star">The Kansas City Star</a>", "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>", and the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>". and In 2003, it was named the "best scenic drive" in the state by "<a href="The%20Detroit%20News">The Detroit News</a>". In 2008, "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" named the island one of the "10 great places to get your feet back on the ground" as a car-free destination, highlighting the unique status of M-185 in the process. The magazine "Paraplegia News", in an article encouraging its readers to visit Mackinac Island, called the trek around the island on M-185 a "high priority" for visitors. The trip around the island "provides a photo opportunity at every bend in the path", according to the "PSA Journal", the official magazine of the <a href="Photographic%20Society%20of%20America">Photographic Society of America</a>.

The beginning and ending of M-185 is marked at the intersection of Main and Fort streets next to the visitor center. That building is operated by the MISPC, but it was originally a <a href="US%20Coast%20Guard">US Coast Guard</a> station. From its starting point, M-185 heads east between <a href="Marquette%20Park%20%28Mackinac%20Island%29">Marquette Park</a>, at the base of Fort Mackinac, and the marina at Haldimand Bay. The roadway passes the <a href="Indian%20Dormitory">Indian Dormitory</a> (Mackinac Art Center), as well as various hotels, bed and breakfast establishments, private residences and landmarks such as <a href="Sainte%20Anne%20Church%20%28Mackinac%20Island%29">Sainte Anne's Catholic Church</a>, <a href="Mission%20Church%20%28Michigan%29">Mission Church</a> and the <a href="Mission%20House%20%28Mackinac%20Island%29">Mission House</a>. Main Street then turns northeasterly, passing <a href="Mission%20Point%20Resort">Mission Point Resort</a> (the former <a href="Mackinac%20College">Mackinac College</a>), after which the road name changes to Lake Shore Road. Along this section of the trunkline, Shoreline Trail departs to the south and follows the water's edge before returning to M-185 at the city's water filtration plant.

After rounding Mission Point, M-185 continues north-northwesterly along the eastern shore of Mackinac Island, first passing Dwightwood Spring then the <a href="Arch%20Rock%20%28Mackinac%20Island%29">Arch Rock</a> viewing area just beyond the mile 1 marker. The next two miles (3.2 km) of M-185 are relatively isolated and devoid of major landmarks as the highway rounds Hennepin Point and runs along Voyageur's Bay. Other than a few picnic tables, the only feature between Arch Rock and mile 3 is the Lake Shore Nature Trail, a short interpretive trail on the inland side of the road. Just beyond mile 3, Scott's Shore Road, a short gravel-surfaced connecting roadway between Lake Shore Road and Scott's Road, departs inland near Point St. Clair. M-185 is bounded by the interior woods on one side and the beaches and rocky shores on the other through this area.
Mile 4 is situated at Point aux Pins at the northernmost point of the island. Here, M-185 turns southerly, passing the state boat dock and a nature center before coming to <a href="British%20Landing">British Landing</a> at the intersection with British Landing Road. The area is a popular stopping point for tourists biking or walking M-185; it is the location where British troops came ashore during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mackinac%20Island%20%281812%29">Battle of Mackinac Island</a> during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. Located around British Landing are various amenities including restrooms, picnic tables, and a concession stand. M-185 continues along Maniboajo Bay and passes the mile 5 marker near Radisson Point.

The next area along M-185 is also sparsely developed as it passes along Griffin Cove. Other than a few newer residential developments, the sights are limited to Brown's Brook, which features a picnic area and interpretive nature trail, and the views of the <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge">Mackinac Bridge</a> as the trunkline rounds both Heriot and Perrot points. Between the markers for miles 6 and 7 is <a href="Devil%27s%20Kitchen%20%28cave%29">Devil's Kitchen</a>, another popular tourist stopping point, at Jacker Point. Near mile 7 is the West Bluff Stairs leading up the bluff to Pontiac's Lookout. Further along, there is a marker commemorating the filming of a scene from "<a href="Somewhere%20in%20Time%20%28film%29">Somewhere in Time</a>" as well as views of the <a href="Grand%20Hotel%20%28Mackinac%20Island%29">Grand Hotel</a>. The building's front porch is promoted as the "longest in the world". Visible to the east of the hotel is <a href="Michigan%20Governor%27s%20Summer%20Residence">Michigan's second Governor's Mansion</a>, which is used as a summer retreat for the state's chief executive. At this point, M-185 transitions back to the more developed portion of the island and the road name for the trunkline changes back to Main Street. Next to the roadway, a boardwalk runs from here into the downtown business district.

The first landmark as the highway approaches downtown Mackinac Island is the island's <a href="Mackinac%20Island%20Public%20School">public school building</a>. As it passes the island's public library on the shoreline side of the street, Main Street makes a sweeping curve to the north at Windermere, or Biddle's, Point to run through the downtown district. Other than the library, most of the city's public buildings are actually situated along Market Street, one block behind Main Street. Three streets and a city park allow for connections between Main and Market streets. M-185 through downtown Mackinac Island passes through the major business district, featuring dozens of shops, restaurants and lodging establishments; nearly a dozen of these outlets feature the authentic Mackinac Island fudge made fresh daily during tourist season. The passenger ferry docks are all situated along Main Street in the downtown area. At the northeastern end of the downtown district, Main Street intersects Fort Street at the state park visitor center to complete its circuit of Mackinac Island.

The first city ordinances banning all motorized vehicles from the island were passed on July 6, 1898, with similar state park rules coming in 1901. The residents complained after a doctor's car scared their horses and caused carriage accidents, and these complaints prompted the ban. As such, other than a handful of emergency and utility vehicles as well as others by special, limited-time permit, no cars or trucks are allowed on the island and no motorized vehicles appear on M-185. During the winter months, the Mackinac Island Police sometimes patrols the island by snowmobile. Traffic on this highway is by foot, on horse, by horse-drawn vehicle, or by bicycle; M-185 is the only such state highway in the country "that allows no automobiles". As a result, the roadside litter is picked up using a horse-drawn wagon.

Lake Shore Road around the island was built between 1900 and 1910 by the state, and the M-185 designation was first assigned on July 12, 1933. The roadway was purpose-built for non-motorized use; it is narrower than other state highways. During the 1950s, the state paved the road in <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a>. Since the 1970s, the MISPC has allowed snowmobiles to operate on Mackinac Island during the winter.
In the mid-1980s, rising water levels in Lake Huron endangered M-185 and bicyclists. The roadway was overwashed by waves from the lake during a storm on May 31, 1985; the waves littered the road with gravel and dirt and raised fears of erosion. MDOT spent around $50,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to install of rock and filter cloth designed to prevent erosion. The expectation at the time was that Lake Huron could rise another that summer. Such a lake level increase prompted worries that the waves would wash away sections of the road. The lake had already washed away shoreline near Arch Rock; there was at least of berm between the road and shoreline in the 1970s and by 1985 some sections had been reduced to just . Storms later that year washed away sections of M-185, removing huge chunks of asphalt. MDOT closed those stretches on July 7, 1986, after the <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a> weekend, to fix the damage. Repairs were budgeted to replace the missing sections of roadway at a cost of $894,366 (equivalent to $ in ); tourists were detoured inland, and uphill, to access the island's various tourist attractions.

In 1979, while filming "Somewhere in Time", a car was brought on the island for <a href="Christopher%20Reeve">Christopher Reeve</a>'s character to drive. The next time that a vehicle was permitted on the island was on July 6, 1998, to commemorate the original ordinance that prohibited cars from Mackinac Island. A 1901 <a href="Geneva%20%28automobile%20company%29">Geneva</a> steam-powered car toured the island and was exhibited in Marquette Park before being towed by horse back to British Landing.

MDOT obtained a $242,000 grant (equivalent to $ in ) from the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> in 2002 to purchase conservation easements along M-185. The land adjacent to the highway on the east side of the island is publicly owned while along the west it is mostly private. The grant allowed the MISPC and MDOT to either purchase the development rights to adjacent properties along Lake Shore Road, or the adjacent properties themselves. 

The only known motor vehicle collision on Mackinac Island occurred on M-185 at the head of the Shepler passenger ferry dock on May 13, 2005, when the island's fire truck slightly damaged the door on the island's ambulance; both vehicles were responding to a report from the ferryboat that an injured passenger required medical attention. Before this incident, it was the only state highway that "never had an automobile accident" according to the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>".

A portion of M-185 was recently resurfaced. This took place during September 2016. MDOT estimated the cost to be $900,000.

The entire highway is on <a href="Mackinac%20Island%2C%20Michigan">Mackinac Island</a>, which is located in <a href="Mackinac%20County%2C%20Michigan">Mackinac County</a>. Milemarkers are posted in a <a href="counterclockwise">counterclockwise</a> fashion.
