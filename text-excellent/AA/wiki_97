Forrest Highway

Forrest Highway is a <a href="highway">highway</a> in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>'s <a href="Peel%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Peel</a> and <a href="South%20West%20%28Western%20Australia%29">South West</a> regions, extending <a href="Perth">Perth</a>'s <a href="Kwinana%20Freeway">Kwinana Freeway</a> from east of <a href="Mandurah%2C%20Western%20Australia">Mandurah</a> down to <a href="Bunbury%2C%20Western%20Australia">Bunbury</a>. Old Coast Road was the original Mandurah–Bunbury route, dating back to the 1840s. Part of that road, and the Australind Bypass around <a href="Australind%2C%20Western%20Australia">Australind</a> and <a href="Eaton%2C%20Western%20Australia">Eaton</a>, were subsumed by Forrest Highway. The highway begins at Kwinana Freeway's southern terminus in <a href="Ravenswood%2C%20Western%20Australia">Ravenswood</a>, continues around the Peel Inlet to <a href="Lake%20Clifton%2C%20Western%20Australia">Lake Clifton</a>, and heads south to finish at Bunbury's Eelup Roundabout. There are a number of <a href="at-grade%20intersection">at-grade intersection</a>s with minor roads in the shires of <a href="Shire%20of%20Murray">Murray</a>, <a href="Shire%20of%20Waroona">Waroona</a>, and <a href="Shire%20of%20Harvey">Harvey</a> including Greenlands Road and Old Bunbury Road, both of which connect to <a href="South%20Western%20Highway">South Western Highway</a> near <a href="Pinjarra%2C%20Western%20Australia">Pinjarra</a>.

The settlement of Australind by the <a href="Western%20Australian%20Land%20Company">Western Australian Land Company</a> in 1840–41 prompted the first real need for a good quality road to Perth. A coastal Australind–Mandurah route was completed by 2 November 1842. Though the road was rebuilt by convicts in the 1850s, its importance was already declining. With a new road via Pinjarra at the foothills of the <a href="Darling%20Scarp">Darling Scarp</a> completed in 1876, and the opening of the Perth−Bunbury railway in 1893, few people travelled up the old coastal road. In the late 1930s there was a proposal to re-establish the road as a tourist route, which could also reduce traffic on the main road along the foothills, but it was put on hold due to World War II. Improvements to Old Coast Road started in the early 1950s, but with little progress made until 1954 when the <a href="Main%20Roads%20Western%20Australia">Main Roads Department</a> approved <a href="Australian%20pound">£</a>1000 worth of works. The name "Old Coast Road" was formally adopted on 27 January 1959, and a <a href="sealed%20road">sealed road</a> was completed in September 1969.

Since the 1980s, the state government has been upgrading the main Perth to Bunbury route, by extending Kwinana Freeway south from Perth, and constructing a <a href="dual%20carriageway">dual carriageway</a> on Old Coast Road north of Bunbury, including bypasses around Australind and <a href="Dawesville%2C%20Western%20Australia">Dawesville</a>. A bypass was also planned around Mandurah, which underwent detailed environmental reviews and assessments in the 1990s and early 2000s. Construction of the New Perth Bunbury Highway project, which became Forrest Highway and the final Kwinana Freeway extension, began in December 2006, and the new highway was opened on 20 September 2009. Within one year of opening, the number of road accidents in the area had decreased significantly, but tourism and businesses in the towns on bypassed routes were also affected. There are few services alongside the highway, although a pair of roadhouses are planned near Greenlands Road. In June 2014, Forrest Highway was extended south to Bunbury by renaming much of Old Coast Road as well as Australind Bypass as part of the highway.

Forrest Highway is the southern section of <a href="List%20of%20road%20routes%20in%20Western%20Australia%232">State Route 2</a>, continuing south from <a href="Kwinana%20Freeway">Kwinana Freeway</a> at a <a href="folded%20diamond%20interchange">folded diamond interchange</a> with <a href="Pinjarra%20Road">Pinjarra Road</a>. All other intersections with the highway are <a href="At-grade%20intersection">at-grade</a>, with cross roads intersected via two closely spaced <a href="T%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bjunction">T junction</a>s. The highway, which is controlled and maintained by <a href="Main%20Roads%20Western%20Australia">Main Roads Western Australia</a>, has two lanes in each direction separated by a wide median strip, and a speed limit of . The road travels south for , over the <a href="Murray%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Murray River</a> and through rural farmland in and beyond <a href="South%20Yunderup%2C%20Western%20Australia">South Yunderup</a>. The highway then veers south-west, meeting Greenlands Road at a pair of staggered T junctions, and continues towards the <a href="Harvey%20Estuary%2C%20Western%20Australia">Harvey Estuary</a> over a distance of before intersecting Mills Road, at another pair of closely spaced T junctions. The road curves back to the south, reaching Old Bunbury Road after . Forrest Highway meanders across the Spearwood dune system for , through a series of large curves, before it reaches <a href="Old%20Coast%20Road">Old Coast Road</a> at , an alternative coastal route to .
Forrest Highway continues south for , to the west of Myalup State Forest and east of Lake Preston. A further takes the highway to the northern edge of <a href="Leschenault%2C%20Western%20Australia">Leschenault</a>. In these sections, the highway passes turnoffs to <a href="Preston%20Beach%2C%20Western%20Australia">Preston Beach</a>, <a href="Myalup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Myalup</a> and <a href="Binningup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Binningup</a>. The countryside for this part is mostly <a href="tuart">tuart</a>, <a href="jarrah">jarrah</a> and <a href="Corymbia%20calophylla">marri</a> forest, with some wetland vegetation and some cleared farming land. The highway then heads south-east, going inland to bypass the developed areas east of the <a href="Leschenault%20Inlet">Leschenault Inlet</a>. After Forrest Highway crosses the <a href="Brunswick%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Brunswick River</a>, continues southwards towards the <a href="Collie%20River">Collie River</a> for another . It crosses the river, then curves around <a href="Eaton%2C%20Western%20Australia">Eaton</a> to head westward to the Eelup Roundabout, which it reaches after travelling for and crossing the adjacent <a href="Preston%20River">Preston River</a>. The signalised roundabout provides access into <a href="Bunbury%2C%20Western%20Australia">Bunbury</a>, as well as to Robertson Road, a ring road that connects to <a href="South%20Western%20Highway">South Western Highway</a> and <a href="Bussell%20Highway">Bussell Highway</a>.

When the highway was first opened in 2009, the average daily weekday traffic volume north of Old Bunbury Road was 9,680. By April 2011, it had increased to 10,660 vehicles. In 2012 up to 14,000 vehicles per day used the highway, and 17,000 by 2014.

Following the establishment of the <a href="Swan%20River%20Colony">Swan River Colony</a>, the earliest report of exploration of the district around what is now Bunbury is from Lieutenant H. W. Bunbury in December 1836. The route he – and later others – took was slow and hazardous, taking four days to cover around , and crossing four rivers. The route began with passage from <a href="Perth">Perth</a> to <a href="Pinjarra%2C%20Western%20Australia">Pinjarra</a>, before turning south-west and passing through low, open scrubland, and a medium-timbered area with low marshes. The first river to cross was the <a href="Harvey%20River">Harvey River</a>, which could only be forded by horses at a single point, near the river mouth. Continuing south-westward, the northern tip of <a href="Leschenault%20Estuary">Leschenault Estuary</a> was reached, and its shores followed before curving around into Bunbury. The last stretch of approximately was the most dangerous for many years, as it required precarious crossings at the Collie and Preston Rivers.
In an initial attempt to settle the area, the government declared the land open for <a href="pastoral">pastoral</a> settlement by ordinary settlers, but little progress was made. By 1840, the population was just fifty-three, and most of those were in or near Bunbury (then known as Port Leschenault). The settlement of Australind by the <a href="Western%20Australian%20Land%20Company">Western Australian Land Company</a> in 1840–41 prompted the first real need for a good quality road to Perth. Throughout much of 1842, there was much debate and discussion over providing a new route to Bunbury. A coastal route from Fremantle had been proposed, while an alternative proposal published on 11 May was a new route from Pinjarra to Bunbury, via an upstream crossing of the Harvey River, where a bridge could easily be built. The coastal route would have required a ferry to cross the Murray River's estuary, and would not go through Pinjarra, a significant settlement in the area; however, it would be shorter, had more water along the route, and would go through the village of Mandurah, which had a population of twenty-nine people from six families.

In a letter dated 12 June 1842 in the <a href="Colonial%20Secretary%20of%20Western%20Australia">Colonial Secretary</a>'s Records, <a href="Marshall%20Clifton">Marshall Clifton</a>, Chief Commissioner of the Western Australian Land Company, wrote of the need for an improved Perth–Fremantle–Bunbury road. On a special trip he took in the previous October to look for a new route, two surveyors gave their approval to the proposed coastal route, with a ferry across the estuary. Governor <a href="John%20Hutt">John Hutt</a> approved of the idea of a road, but thought a ferry would be impractical, at least during winter, and that the lack of public funds made it impossible. Clifton continued to write letters to the Colonial Secretary advocating the construction of a road.

During the winter of 1842, the existing route became impassable, and Clifton undertook the creation of the proposed coastal route. He sent his company's men to clear the path and make a road. The first report of the new road was on 19 October, praising the new route but deriding the almost impassable obstacles presented by the large rivers en route. The Australind–Mandurah route was completed by 2 November, and the speed of the new route allowed almost daily communication. It could be travelled in 32 hours, with a ferry to cross the estuary at Mandurah. The ferry was operated, and later owned, by nearby resident Mrs Lyttleton, as the government was not interested at that time in owning or leasing out the ferry. The government later appropriated the ferry on 2 February 1843, and imposed standardised tolls for passengers and livestock. Ten years later, the ferry service was made available to the public free of charge.
The road was rebuilt by convicts in the 1850s, but by that decade, the importance of the coast road was diminishing. For most of its length, the road went through well-timbered, sandy limestone country of little value to agriculture, and settlers in the vicinity of the road were scarce. In contrast, settlements had spread and prospered in the foothills of the <a href="Darling%20Scarp">Darling Scarp</a>, and on 1 July 1853, Colonial Secretary <a href="Frederick%20Barlee">Frederick Barlee</a> announced a new proposal for a Perth–Pinjarra–Bunbury route along the foothills, with a width, mostly following the alignment of previous tracks. Between 1864 and 1876, two parties of convicts were involved in the making of the road.

From 30 June 1868, the government discontinued the ferry's operation and the position of caretaker, leaving travellers to work the ferry themselves. The news was not well received, with newspaper letters complaining of the great inconvenience to the users of the shorter coastal route. As a result, the government reappointed a caretaker on 30 March 1869. In 1894 the ferry was finally abandoned in favour of a wooden bridge adjacent to old ferry jetties, which was built by contract at a cost of £1700. However, following the completion of the Perth–Bunbury railway in 1893, few people travelled up the coast road. While the adjacent land was still privately owned, it was uninhabited.

Within the first few years of the twentieth century, the road had become known as "the old coast road", or simply Old Coast Road. In 1907, the road was described as being seldom used, except by tramps, runaway sailors, and <a href="swagmen">swagmen</a>, with very few settlers in the area. For the next three decades, there was little interest in the road, other than maintaining it in a usable condition. By 1918 it had become almost impassable, so the <a href="Harvey%20Road%20Board">Harvey Road Board</a> decided to spend £300 to reconstruct a length. A few years later, in 1921, the section from Lake Clifton to Mandurah was reopened by Jack Ochiltree, so as to be suitable for motor vehicles, and in 1926 the section from Bunbury to Lake Preston was similarly suitable.

The establishment of a tourist route along the coastal road between Australind and Mandurah was proposed in the late 1930s by the Harvey Road Board. The <a href="Bunbury%20Road%20Board">Bunbury Road Board</a> supported the idea, with the beauty and pleasure of the route discussed at a meeting of the road board in January 1939; the lack of a proper <a href="road%20surface">road surface</a> was seen as the only obstacle. Traffic was predicted to grow over the next five years to an extent that would justify a second route to Perth, particularly as the traffic volume on the existing inland road was already heavy and causing accidents. The Minister for Works, <a href="Harry%20Millington%20%28politician%29">Harry Millington</a>, considered the proposal in July 1939, and by early 1940 a number of rumours emerged regarding the imminent commencement of works; however, the <a href="Main%20Roads%20Western%20Australia">Main Roads Department</a> had no intention to undertake them. The Harvey Road Board decided to refrain from pursuing the matter until <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> had concluded. By 1943, vegetation was overgrowing the road, making it difficult to spot in places, and in December 1946 about was inundated by water deep. Negotiations between Main Roads and the road boards recommenced in 1947, and by October 1948 the provision of a suitable road was costed at £280,000. Given that a good quality road already linked Perth and Bunbury, and there was likely to be little immediate benefit, Main Roads did not consider the proposal to be warranted.

At a February 1949 conference of officials from <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Western%20Australia">local governments</a> in the <a href="South%20West%20%28Western%20Australia%29">South West</a> region it was decided to once more pursue the reopening of the coastal route, due to the amount of traffic on the existing Perth–Bunbury road. Over the next year the proposal was supported by the Bunbury Chamber of Commerce, South West Zone Development Committee, and <a href="Bunbury%20Municipal%20Council">Bunbury Municipal Council</a>. Reasons for supporting the proposal included "defence, land settlement, relieving the main highway, and tourist advantages". It was also a political issue leading up to the <a href="Western%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201950">1950 state election</a>, as well as afterwards. The summer of 1950 had seen a shortage of milk in Perth, leading to the consideration of turning undeveloped land along Old Coast Road into pastures for dairy farming. After inspecting the land on 17 May 1950, the Agriculture Minister advocated for Old Coast Road to be reopened, to develop the adjacent land which was well suited to milk production.

An official inspection in October 1950 reported that it would not be difficult to improve the old road into a reasonable track, which would then have a better chance of attracting assistance from Main Roads. The <a href="Mandurah%20Road%20Board">Mandurah Road Board</a> spent £1200 on the road, while the Harvey Road Board requested a £500 grant from Main Roads for their portion of the road. Two years later little progress had been made, and Main Roads therefore refused to fund feeder roads to connect to Old Coast Road. By May 1952, works had halted as Main Roads believed that the existing, winding route around the estuary was too prone to flooding. Settlers in the area recalled it never flooding previously, and the Mandurah Road Board was concerned that should a new road be built, they would still have to maintain the old road for access to properties. The road was inspected by the Premier, Deputy-Commissioner of Main Roads J. D. Leach, and the district engineer H. A. Smith. They indicated that a new road would likely closely follow the old road, but that a detailed survey would be needed. Nearby limestone deposits would be suitable for the road's foundation, with the cost estimated at £11 per chain.
Mandurah had grown rapidly as a tourist destination in the post war period, and on 17 April 1953 a new bridge connecting Old Coast Road to Mandurah was opened. Construction of the new bridge, adjacent to the old bridge, began in September 1951, and was designed with reinforced concrete piles. The old wooden bridge had rapidly deteriorated due to the presence of marine organisms, and needed considerable attention to maintain it in a usable condition. The opening ceremony was attended by the Chairman of the Mandurah Road Board, W. Anderson, Leader of the Opposition, Ross McLarty, Minister for Works, <a href="John%20Tonkin">John Tonkin</a>; Commissioner of Main Roads, Digby Leach; C. H. Henning, MLC; engineer in charges of bridges, Ernest Godfrey; local government representatives, and a number of schoolchildren who were given a half-day off school.

No further work had been done on Old Coast Road by 1954, as the road boards in the area had insufficient funds. More pressure for a new road came from the Education Department, which saw the need for a school bus in the area, but could not provide the service due to the poor condition of Old Coast Road. Leach, who was by then the Commissioner, indicated that Main Roads would likely approve requests for grants to improve Old Coast road from the road boards in the area, and that provision for funding had been made in the 1954–55 budget. Work was finally cleared to commence in September 1954 with Main Roads approving the Mandurah Road Board's schedule of works, including £1000 for the following works on Old Coast Road: 

The name "Old Coast Road" was formally adopted on 27 January 1959, and a <a href="sealed%20road">sealed road</a> was completed in September 1969.

Since the 1980s, the state government has been committed to constructing and upgrading the Perth Bunbury Highway, a route along coastal roads, including Old Coast Road south of Mandurah. The ultimate design is for a freeway or expressway-standard road, but with staged construction initially providing a dual carriageway.

The Australind Bypass was constructed in the 1980s to relieve pressure on Old Coast Road, and improve local amenity. The bypass travelled to the east and south of Australind and Eaton, to connect to Bunbury's Eelup Roundabout via an alignment previously part of Jubilee Road. There were slight deviations in the route to protect remnant <a href="paperbark">paperbark</a> trees, <a href="tuart">tuart</a>s, <a href="acacia">acacia</a>, and aquatic plants, as well as a site of aboriginal importance, identified by botanical and aboriginal heritage surveys. Australind Bypass was built in two stages by the Bunbury Division of Main Roads. The first stage opened on 11 December 1987, and was a length from Eelup Roundabout to Eaton Drive, plus a link from the bypass (north of the rail line) and the Collie River bridge on Old Coast Road. Stage two, the remaining to reconnect with Old Coast Road, was completed ahead of schedule in December 1998.

Australind Bypass was opened on 16 December 1988 by Federal Transport Minister <a href="Bob%20Brown%20%28Australian%20Labor%20politician%29">Bob Brown</a>, who helped complete the final seal, together with the Mayor of Bunbury Ern Manea. State Transport Minister <a href="Bob%20Pearce">Bob Pearce</a> planted a roadside tree to commemorate the opening of the bypass, which was also attended by the Commissioner of Main Roads Albert Tognolini, and Mitchell MLA David Smith, Minister for Community Service, Justice and the South West. Vintage cars led a procession from the on-site opening ceremony to a reception held in Bunbury. The new road was designed to be easily made into a dual carriageway when required; this was completed nine years later, with the Australind Bypass duplication project officially opened by Mitchell MLA <a href="Dan%20Sullivan%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Dan Sullivan</a> on 18 December 1997.

In addition to the Australind Bypass, much of Old Coast Road was upgraded to a dual carriageway. A second carriageway through <a href="Halls%20Head%2C%20Western%20Australia">Halls Head</a> and <a href="Falcon%2C%20Western%20Australia">Falcon</a> was opened in 1989. Two further dual carriageway sections, from Harvey to Myalup, and around Glen Iris, opened on 17 June 1996. The dual carriageway was extended up to Lake Clifton . Construction of the dual carriageway Dawesville Bypass around eastern <a href="Dawesville%2C%20Western%20Australia">Dawesville</a>, south of Mandurah, began in late 2000, and was opened in July 2001.

While Old Coast Road's dual carriageway was advancing north from Bunbury, and Kwinana Freeway was progressively being extended south from Perth, the alignment through Mandurah was constrained by existing development. Keeping the existing alignment would result in a <a href="traffic%20bottleneck">traffic bottleneck</a> through Mandurah. To overcome this problem, Main Roads began planning for a new route east of the <a href="Peel%20Inlet">Peel Inlet</a> in the 1980s.
The proposed Perth Bunbury Highway Peel deviation, part of which later became an extension to Kwinana Freeway, underwent a public environmental review in 1997, and an environmental assessment by the <a href="Environmental%20Protection%20Authority%20of%20Western%20Australia">Environmental Protection Authority</a> (EPA) in 2000. The relevant environment factors considered by the EPA were vegetation communities, declared rare and priority flora, wetlands, and traffic noise. Main Roads proposed management plans for each factor. Only clearing of vegetation critical for road construction would be undertaken, and more vegetation would be replaced than the amount impacted, using local native species. A survey for declared rare and priority flora found no rare species, and only one priority species, "<a href="Lasiopetalum">Lasiopetalum membranaceum</a>", near the southern end of the project. Road construction would impact one conservation class wetland, but no protected wetlands. To minimise impact, road drainage would be designed to contain spills and prevent direct discharges into the surrounding environment. Noise levels would be contained to an acceptable limit in the road design, in accordance with the Main Roads traffic noise policy. The EPA concluded that the road could be designed and managed to an acceptable standard. Main Roads' 2006 plan for environmental management of the project included numerous aspects, which for the northern segment of the project exceeded the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, topsoil management, construction, foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.

Construction of the highway and freeway extension began in December 2006, with the whole project then called the New Perth Bunbury Highway. The work was undertaken by a partnership of Main Roads, <a href="CIMIC%20Group%23CPB%20Contractors">Leighton Contractors</a>, WA Limestone and <a href="GHD%20Group">GHD</a>, known as the Southern Gateway Alliance. The project consisted of a freeway-standard extension as far as South Yunderup Road in South Yunderup, and a highway-standard dual carriageway to Old Coast Road at Lake Clifton. Taking traffic around the eastern side of the <a href="Peel-Harvey%20Estuary">Peel-Harvey Estuary</a> prior to joining the existing dual carriageway on Old Coast Road reduced the journey time from Perth to Bunbury. The final road names were not known until early 2009, when Transport Minister <a href="Simon%20O%27Brien%20%28politician%29">Simon O'Brien</a> revealed that the section south of Pinjarra Road would be known as Forrest Highway, with the section to the north to become part of Kwinana Freeway. The highway's name commemorates Sir <a href="John%20Forrest">John Forrest</a>, the state's first <a href="Premier%20of%20Western%20Australia">premier</a>. The Kwinana Freeway extension and Forrest Highway were opened on 20 September 2009, with a ceremony held at the interchange between the freeway, highway, and Pinjarra Road. The roads were officially opened by Premier <a href="Colin%20Barnett">Colin Barnett</a>, Senator <a href="Chris%20Evans%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Chris Evans</a>, Transport Minister Simon O'Brien, Member for Canning <a href="Don%20Randall">Don Randall</a>, and the previous Transport Minister <a href="Alannah%20MacTiernan">Alannah MacTiernan</a>. The $705 million project (equivalent to $ million in ) was jointly funded by the state and federal governments, which contributed $375 million and $330 million respectively (equivalent to $ million and $ million in ). At the time it opened, it was Western Australia's largest ever road infrastructure project.

One year after Forrest Highway opened, the number of road accidents on the main roads in the area had decreased by 60%. Traffic on South Western Highway had reduced by 50% north of Pinjarra, and by 20% to the south, and there was an 82% reduction along Old Coast Road within a month of the new highway opening. However, tourism in towns along the former routes was affected by the reduced traffic flow, with businesses losing as much as 60% of their trade.
Forrest Highway has been criticised for the lack of roadside facilities. In January 2014, it was described as "the busiest, most unserviced, long stretch of highway in the nation" by MP <a href="Murray%20Cowper">Murray Cowper</a>, Member for <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Murray-Wellington">Murray-Wellington</a>. With toilets only available at the John Tognela Rest Area near the southern end of the highway, travellers have reportedly stopped alongside the highway or side roads to urinate and change <a href="nappies">nappies</a>. A farming family with property adjacent to the highway was willing to invest in a roadhouse near <a href="Herron%20Point%2C%20Western%20Australia">Herron Point</a>, but Main Roads required roadhouses to be built on both sides of the highway. According to Cowper, traffic volume would need to increase from 17,000 to 30,000 vehicles per day to justify such an investment.

A few months later, in April 2014, a Perth developer had begun constructing twin roadhouses south of Greenlands Road, approximately halfway between Perth and Bunbury. The property was purchased in 2004, before construction began on the highway, with the intention of developing the site when there was a viable amount of traffic. The main tenant will be a national fuel retailer, with food and beverage retailers and other amenities to be located on both sides of the highway. The facilities were initially expected to be completed by the end of 2014, but work was put on hold due to a legal dispute between the developer and landowner. The dispute was resolved and development resumed in June 2015, with completion expected by Easter 2016, according to Cowper.

On 5 June 2014, the <a href="Committee%20for%20Geographical%20Names%20in%20Australasia">Geographic Names Committee</a> decide to rename the roads that connect Forrest Highway to Bunbury – part of Old Coast Road as well as Australind Bypass – as part of the highway. The renaming had been proposed in 2013 due to public confusion over the three names used for the route to Bunbury: Forrest Highway to Lake Clifton, Old Coast Road from there to north of Australind, and then Australind Bypass. Emergency services had difficulty locating incidents due to the confusion. The renaming followed similar changes to Main Roads' internal-use designations in May 2011, which deprecated Perth Bunbury Highway (Highway H2) in favour of Melville Mandurah Highway (Highway H2) for the portion north of Mandurah, Lakeland Lake Clifton Road (Main Road M74) for the Mandurah to Lake Clifton section together with <a href="Mandjoogoordap%20Drive">Mandjoogoordap Drive</a>, and an extension of Forrest Highway (Highway H57) for the Lake Clifton to Bunbury portion. Changes to the road signs were expected to be completed by mid-July. The renaming was considered unusual, as it affected a significant length of a major road, which was the address of eleven residential properties.

While much of Old Coast Road was renamed Forrest Highway in 2014, bypassed sections of the former Perth Bunbury Highway near Mandurah and Australind have retained the name Old Coast Road, and have significance as part of numbered <a href="Route%20number%23Australia">road routes</a>.

Old Coast Road starts at the intersection of Mandurah Terrace and Pinjarra Road in Mandurah. It crosses the Mandurah estuary into <a href="Halls%20Head%2C%20Western%20Australia">Halls Head</a> via the Mandurah Bridge. The road heads south-west as a <a href="two-lane%20road">two-lane road</a> serving the canal estate in eastern Halls Head. After Old Coast Road intersects Mandurah Road at a T junction. Mandurah Road and Old Coast Road south-westbound form a continuous dual carriageway, and from here Old Coast Road is part of <a href="Highway%201%20%28Western%20Australia%29">National Route 1</a>. The road then proceeds through Mandurah's southern suburbs of <a href="Falcon%2C%20Western%20Australia">Falcon</a> and <a href="Wannanup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Wannanup</a> for before bridging the <a href="Dawesville%20Channel">Dawesville Channel</a>. After , Old Coast Road turns south to run through eastern Dawesville as a single carriageway; about to the west the dual carriageway also travels south as Dawesville Bypass. The two routes meet again after .

The Great American Bash (2005)

The Great American Bash (2005) was a <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a> <a href="pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a> (PPV) <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20pay-per-view%20events">event</a> produced by <a href="World%20Wrestling%20Entertainment">World Wrestling Entertainment</a> (WWE). It was the second annual event and took place on July 24, 2005, at the <a href="KeyBank%20Center">HSBC Arena</a> in <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>. The event featured wrestlers and other talent that performed on the <a href="SmackDown%20%28WWE%20brand%29">SmackDown!</a> program.

The <a href="main%20event">main event</a> was <a href="Dave%20Batista">Batista</a> defending the <a href="World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Heavyweight Championship</a> against <a href="John%20Layfield">John "Bradshaw" Layfield</a> (JBL). JBL won the match after Batista was <a href="Professional%20wrestling%23Disqualification">disqualified</a>, but did not win the title because a championship can only be won via <a href="pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">pinfall</a> or <a href="Professional%20wrestling%23Submission">submission</a>. One of the featured matches on the <a href="undercard">undercard</a> was <a href="Rey%20Mysterio%2C%20Jr.">Rey Mysterio</a> versus <a href="Eddie%20Guerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a>, which Mysterio won by pinfall. The other was <a href="Orlando%20Jordan">Orlando Jordan</a> versus <a href="Chris%20Benoit">Chris Benoit</a> for the <a href="WWE%20United%20States%20Championship">WWE United States Championship</a>, which Jordan won, also by pinfall.

The event grossed over US$375,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 8,000, and received about 233,000 pay-per-view buys, the same amount as the <a href="The%20Great%20American%20Bash%20%282006%29">following year's event</a>. This enabled WWE's pay-per-view revenue to increase by $4.7 million from the previous year. When the 2005 event was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a>, it reached a peak position of second on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"'s DVD Sales Chart. The event was also available free of charge for <a href="Military%20of%20the%20United%20States">Armed Forces</a> members and their families.

The Great American Bash event featured a <a href="card%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">card</a>, which contained matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing <a href="Teleplay">scripted</a> feuds, <a href="plot%20%28narrative%29">plots</a> and <a href="narrative">storylines</a>. Wrestlers portrayed either a <a href="Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">villainous</a> or <a href="Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">fan favorite</a> gimmick as they followed a series of events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match. The name of a wrestler's character was not always the person's <a href="birth%20name">birth name</a>, as wrestlers often use a <a href="stage%20name">stage name</a> to portray their character.
The <a href="main%20event">main event</a> at The Great American Bash was a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Variations%20of%20singles%20matches">standard wrestling match</a> for the <a href="World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Heavyweight Championship</a>, in which <a href="Dave%20Batista">Batista</a> defended the championship against <a href="John%20Layfield">John "Bradshaw" Layfield</a> (JBL). The buildup to the match began when <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Champion</a> <a href="John%20Cena">John Cena</a> was drafted to the <a href="Raw%20%28WWE%20brand%29">Raw</a> brand, taking the title with him and leaving SmackDown! without a top-tier championship for the heavyweight division. <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20authority%20figures%23General%20Managers%202">General Manager</a> <a href="Theodore%20Long">Theodore Long</a>, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, announced a match between six wrestlers for a new top-tier SmackDown! championship. On the June 30 episode of the "SmackDown!" television program, the match took place between JBL, <a href="Chris%20Benoit">Chris Benoit</a>, <a href="Christian%20%28wrestler%29">Christian</a>, <a href="Booker%20Huffman">Booker T</a>, <a href="Mark%20Copani">Muhammad Hassan</a>, and <a href="The%20Undertaker">The Undertaker</a>. JBL was victorious in the match, but Long announced that he was still not the champion. Instead he had won the right to a match against the World Heavyweight Champion, Batista, who was SmackDown!'s final 2005 draft pick, making the World Heavyweight Championship exclusive to SmackDown!. On the July 14 episode of "SmackDown!", Batista defeated <a href="Orlando%20Jordan">Orlando Jordan</a> in a standard match after performing a <a href="Batista%20Bomb">Batista Bomb</a>. After the match, JBL successfully attacked Batista by executing a <a href="A%20double%20clothesline">clothesline</a>. The following week on "SmackDown!", JBL, who was accompanied by Jordan, threw himself a celebration party with the belief that he had already won the World Heavyweight Championship. Batista appeared, and as JBL fled the scene, performed a <a href="spinebuster">spinebuster</a> on Jordan.

The event also featured a feud between <a href="Rey%20Mysterio%2C%20Jr.">Rey Mysterio</a> and <a href="Eddie%20Guerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a>. At the <a href="No%20Way%20Out%20%282005%29">No Way Out</a> event, Guerrero and Mysterio won the <a href="WWE%20Raw%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">WWE Tag Team Championships</a> from the <a href="Basham%20Brothers">Basham Brothers</a>. After Guerrero and Mysterio lost the championships, Guerrero then began to portray a <a href="Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">villainous</a> character, <a href="Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Turn">turning</a> on Mysterio in the process. At <a href="WrestleMania%2021">WrestleMania</a>, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a standard match. On the April 21 episode of "SmackDown!", <a href="MNM%20%28wrestling%29">MNM</a> (<a href="John%20Morrison%20%28wrestler%29">Johnny Nitro</a> and <a href="Adam%20Birch">Joey Mercury</a>) defeated Mysterio and Guerrero to win the tag team championship. On the April 28 episode of "SmackDown!", Guerrero and Mysterio faced MNM in a rematch for the title, but MNM retained them after pinning Mysterio for the win. At the <a href="Judgment%20Day%20%282005%29">Judgment Day</a> event, Mysterio defeated Guerrero by disqualification, and on the June 30 episode of "SmackDown!", the rivalry between Guerrero and Mysterio continued when Guerrero threatened to reveal a secret concerning Mysterio's son Dominick. Both the Mysterio and Guerrero families continued to beg Guerrero to not reveal the secret. A match was made between Mysterio and Guerrero for The Great American Bash, where if Mysterio won, Guerrero could not reveal the secret, but if Guerrero won, he would be able to reveal the secret on live television.

The third predominant feud prior to the event was between Chris Benoit and Orlando Jordan for the <a href="WWE%20United%20States%20Championship">WWE United States Championship</a>. On the July 7 edition of "SmackDown!", Benoit defeated Booker T in a match to become the #1 contender for the title. Long granted Benoit a match against Jordan for The Great American Bash.

Before the pay-per-view went live, a match took place on the "<a href="WWE%20Heat">Sunday Night Heat</a>" pre-show between <a href="Paul%20London">Paul London</a> and <a href="James%20Maritato">Nunzio</a> for the <a href="WWE%20Cruiserweight%20Championship%20%281991%E2%80%932007%29">WWE Cruiserweight Championship</a>, which London won to retain the title.

The first match on the card was between MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury, managed by <a href="Melina%20Perez">Melina</a>) and <a href="The%20Road%20Warriors%23L.O.D.%202005%20%282005%E2%80%932006%29">The Legion of Doom</a> (<a href="Jon%20Heidenreich">Heidenreich</a> and <a href="Road%20Warrior%20Animal">Road Warrior Animal</a>) for the <a href="WWE%20Raw%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">WWE Tag Team Championship</a>. During the match, Nitro hit Animal with one of the championship belts, but Animal retaliated by <a href="powerslam">powerslam</a>ming him. Animal and Heidenreich then performed the <a href="Doomsday%20Device%20%28wrestling%29">doomsday device</a> on Nitro and scored the <a href="pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">pin</a> to win the match and the titles.

The next match was between <a href="Booker%20T%20%28wrestler%29">Booker T</a> (managed by <a href="Sharmell%20Sullivan">Sharmell</a>) and <a href="Christian%20%28wrestler%29">Christian</a>. Booker T won the match after performing a <a href="scissor%20kick%20%28strike%29">scissors kick</a>. 

In the next match, <a href="Orlando%20Jordan">Orlando Jordan</a> faced <a href="Chris%20Benoit">Chris Benoit</a> for the <a href="WWE%20United%20States%20Championship">United States Championship</a>. During the match, Jordan removed the top turnbuckle pad. Benoit attempted to slam Jordan but Jordan avoided the attack and instead forced Benoit to run into the exposed turnbuckle. Jordan scored the pin to win the match and retain the title.

The fourth match was between <a href="The%20Undertaker">The Undertaker</a> and <a href="Muhammad%20Hassan%20%28wrestler%29">Muhammad Hassan</a> (managed by <a href="Shawn%20Daivari">Daivari</a>) to determine the #1 contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. During Hassan's entrance, men in masks accompanied him to the ring to represent his Arabic culture. The masked men proceeded to interfered in the match, but Undertaker retaliated and removed all of the masked men from the ring. Midway through the match, Undertaker attempted to use a <a href="Tombstone%20piledriver">Tombstone piledriver</a> on Hassan, but Hassan escaped the move and attempted a Clothesline. The Undertaker countered by <a href="chokeslam">chokeslam</a>ming Hassan and scored the pinfall on Hassan to win the match and become the #1 contender. Following this, Undertaker executed a Last Ride through the stage floor on Hassan, writing him out of storylines.

The next match was between <a href="The%20Mexicools">The Mexicools</a> and <a href="The%20Blue%20World%20Order">The Blue World Order</a> in a six-man <a href="tag%20team">tag team</a> match. At the match's end, <a href="Super%20Crazy">Super Crazy</a> executed a <a href="moonsault">moonsault</a> onto <a href="Stevie%20Richards">Big Stevie Cool</a> from the top ring rope, and <a href="Psicosis">Psicosis</a> performed a <a href="leg%20drop">leg drop</a>. Psicosis proceeded to pin Big Stevie and win the match for his team.

The following match was between <a href="Rey%20Mysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> and <a href="Eddie%20Guerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a>, where the stipulation was that if Guerrero won the match, he would reveal the secret he has been hiding from the public that neither Mysterio's nor Guerrero's families wanted revealed. If Mysterio won, however, Guerrero would not reveal the secret. Guerrero executed the Three Amigos on Mysterio and performed a <a href="frog%20splash">frog splash</a>. Guerrero then tried to score the pinfall, but Mysterio countered by pinning Guerrero to win the match. As a result, Guerrero was not able to reveal the secret.

The seventh match was between <a href="Melina%20Perez">Melina</a> and <a href="Torrie%20Wilson">Torrie Wilson</a> with <a href="Candice%20Michelle">Candice Michelle</a>, as the <a href="professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Special%20referee">guest referee</a>, in a <a href="Bra%20and%20Panties%20Match">Bra and Panties match</a>. The only way to win a "Bra and Panties" match is for a wrestler to strip her opponent down to her underwear. At the start of the match, Wilson pulled off Melina's shirt to reveal her bra, but Melina retaliated and pulled off Wilson's shirt. Wilson then lifted Melina to her shoulders and dropped her to the mat, while she attempted to pull off her pants, but Melina countered the attack by pulling Wilson's pants off to win the match. Afterward, Michelle stripped Melina and then removed her own clothes, as well.

The <a href="main%20event">main event</a> was between <a href="Dave%20Batista">Batista</a> and <a href="John%20Layfield">JBL</a> (managed by Orlando Jordan) for the <a href="World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Heavyweight Championship</a>. Jordan interfered by attempting to hit Batista with a <a href="folding%20chair">folding chair</a>, but Batista grabbed the chair from him. Batista then used the chair to hit Jordan and JBL, and JBL was declared the winner, via disqualification. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or submission (the normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title. After the match Batista gave JBL and Jordan a Batista Bomb.

The feud between Batista and JBL continued after the Bash. On the July 28 episode of "SmackDown!", JBL defeated The Undertaker after interference from Randy Orton to become the number-one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at <a href="SummerSlam%20%282005%29">SummerSlam</a>. The following week on "SmackDown!", Batista and JBL held a scripted official contract signing, where it was announced that their match at SummerSlam would be a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23No%20Disqualification%20match">No Holds Barred match</a> that allowed for no disqualification. At SummerSlam, Batista defeated JBL to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. The feud between the two ended when Batista defeated JBL in a <a href="Texas%20Bullrope%20Match">Texas Bullrope match</a> on the September 9 edition of "SmackDown!", a match where the objective is to touch all four ring corners while tied to one's opponent with a bullrope.

On the edition of "SmackDown!" following The Great American Bash, Eddie Guerrero revealed the secret he had been keeping; he was Dominick's real father, not Rey Mysterio (was thought to be). At SummerSlam, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a ladder match, where the goal is to climb a ladder to retrieve an object that is suspended in the air. As per pre-match stipulations, Mysterio gained complete <a href="Child%20custody">custody</a> of Dominick. On the September 9 edition of "SmackDown!", Guerrero defeated Mysterio in a <a href="steel%20cage">steel cage</a> match to end the feud. Guerrero then began a feud with Batista when Guerrero was given a title match at <a href="No%20Mercy%20%282005%29">No Mercy</a>. Guerrero, however, died unexpectedly of <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a> on November 13, 2005. In 2006 Guerrero was inducted into the <a href="WWE%20Hall%20of%20Fame">WWE Hall of Fame</a> by Mysterio, his nephew <a href="Chavo%20Guerrero%2C%20Jr.">Chavo Guerrero</a>, and Chris Benoit.

The feud between Chris Benoit and Orlando Jordan continued. At SummerSlam, Benoit defeated Jordan for the WWE United States Championship in a match that lasted 25.5 seconds. On the September 1 edition of "SmackDown!", Benoit once again defeated Jordan for the title, but this time the match lasted 23.4 seconds. The following week on "SmackDown!", Benoit defeated Jordan in another title match, where the match lasted 22.5 seconds.

The HSBC Arena has a maximum capacity of 18,690, but it was reduced for The Great American Bash. The event grossed over $375,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 8,000, the maximum allowed. The event resulted in 233,000 pay-per-view buys, which was the same amount as the <a href="The%20Great%20American%20Bash%20%282006%29">following year's Great American Bash</a>. The promotion's pay-per-view revenue was $21.6 million, greater than the previous year's revenue of $16.9 million. The event was widely criticized by fans and critics alike. "<a href="Canadian%20Online%20Explorer">Canadian Online Explorer</a>"'s professional wrestling section rated the event a five out of ten. The World Heavyweight Championship main event match was rated three out of ten, and the match between Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero received the highest match rating of eight out of ten.

The event was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> on August 23, 2005, by <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment">Sony Music Entertainment</a>. The DVD reached seventh on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"'s DVD Sales Chart for recreational sports during the week of October 8, 2005, and it rose to the fourth spot the following week. It remained on the chart's "top ten" for four consecutive weeks, until the week of December 15, 2005, when it ranked thirteenth.

Science Fiction Quarterly

Science Fiction Quarterly was an American <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp</a> <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> magazine that was published from 1940 to 1943 and again from 1951 to 1958. <a href="Charles%20Hornig">Charles Hornig</a> served as editor for the first two issues; <a href="Robert%20A.%20W.%20Lowndes">Robert A. W. Lowndes</a> edited the remainder. "Science Fiction Quarterly" was launched by publisher <a href="Louis%20Silberkleit">Louis Silberkleit</a> during a boom in science fiction magazines at the end of the 1930s. Silberkleit launched two other science fiction titles ("<a href="Future%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Science%20Fiction%20Stories">Science Fiction</a>" and "<a href="Future%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Science%20Fiction%20Stories">Future Fiction</a>) "at about the same time: all three ceased publication before the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, falling prey to slow sales and paper shortages. In 1950 and 1951, as the market improved, Silberkleit relaunched "Future Fiction" and "Science Fiction Quarterly". By the time "Science Fiction Quarterly" ceased publication in 1958, it was the last surviving science fiction pulp.

"Science Fiction Quarterly"s policy was to reprint a novel in each issue as the lead story, and Silberkleit was able to obtain reprint rights to two early science fiction novels and several of <a href="Ray%20Cummings">Ray Cummings</a>' books. Both Hornig and Lowndes were given minuscule budgets, and Hornig in particular had trouble finding good material to print. Lowndes did somewhat better, as he was able to call on his friends in the <a href="Futurians">Futurians</a>, a group of aspiring writers that included <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a>, and <a href="Donald%20Wollheim">Donald Wollheim</a>. The second incarnation of the magazine also had a policy of running a lead novel, though in practice the lead stories were often well short of novel length. Among the better-known stories published by the magazine were "Second Dawn", by <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>; "<a href="The%20Last%20Question">The Last Question</a>", by Isaac Asimov; and "<a href="Common%20Time">Common Time</a>", by James Blish.

Although science fiction (sf) had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", a <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. By the end of the 1930s, the field was booming. <a href="Louis%20Silberkleit">Louis Silberkleit</a>, a publisher who had once worked for Gernsback, launched a pulp magazine in March 1939 titled <a href="Science%20Fiction%20%28American%20magazine%29">"Science Fiction"</a>, under his <a href="Blue%20Ribbon%20Magazines">Blue Ribbon Magazines</a> imprint. For an editor, Gernsback recommended <a href="Charles%20Hornig">Charles Hornig</a>, who had edited "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Wonder Stories</a>" for Gernsback from 1933 to 1936. Silberkleit took the recommendation, and Hornig was hired in October 1938. Hornig had no office; he worked from home, coming into the office as needed to drop off manuscripts and dummy materials, and pick up typeset materials to proof. He was given broad freedom to select what he wanted to publish, since Silberkleit's chief editor, Abner J. Sundell, knew little about sf and did not get involved with running the magazine.

To spread his costs over more magazines, Silberkleit soon decided to launch two additional titles. In November 1939 the first issue of "<a href="Future%20Fiction">Future Fiction</a>" appeared; it was followed in July 1940 by "Science Fiction Quarterly". Hornig was editor for all three of the magazines. In October 1940, Hornig, who was a pacifist, received his military call-up. He decided to move to California and register as a <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a>; he continued to edit the magazines from the west coast, but Silberkleit was unhappy with the arrangement. Silberkleit allowed Hornig to retain his post as editor of "Science Fiction", and offered the editorship of the other two titles to <a href="Sam%20Moskowitz">Sam Moskowitz</a>. Moskowitz declined, saying afterwards that he "would never strike at a man's job", but <a href="Donald%20Wollheim">Donald Wollheim</a>, a member of a group of aspiring writers called the <a href="Futurians">Futurians</a>, heard about the offer. Wollheim told <a href="Robert%20W.%20Lowndes">Robert W. Lowndes</a>, another member of the Futurians, about the opening, and urged him to write to Silberkleit. Lowndes later recalled Wollheim's idea: "In the letter, I'd suggest that it might be a good idea to add a science fiction title to the list, offering my services as editor at a slightly lower price than Hornig was being paid, and also find fault with all the other sf titles presently out, but particularly with Hornig's". Lowndes relates that Silberkleit took the bait and hired him in November 1940; Hornig recalls the separation as being by mutual consent because of his move to California. Lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be the real reason Silberkleit replaced Hornig.

The first issues Lowndes was responsible for were the Spring 1941 issue of "Science Fiction Quarterly" and the April 1941 issue of "Future Fiction". Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had over Hornig, vetoing five of the seven stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 "Future", but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit "was satisfied that I knew what I was doing, and [...] didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".

In 1950 Silberkleit revived "Future Fiction", and the following year he brought back "Science Fiction Quarterly", with the first issue of the new series dated May 1951. A new magazine, "<a href="Dynamic%20Science%20Fiction">Dynamic Science Fiction</a>", followed in 1952. All three were edited by Lowndes and all were in pulp format. Sales were satisfactory, but Silberkleit decided to experiment with the <a href="Digest%20size">digest format</a>, which was starting to become more popular. By the end of 1955 he had cancelled "Dynamic Science Fiction", switched "Future" "Fiction "to digest format, and relaunched "Science Fiction" as a digest under a new title, "Science Fiction Stories". Only "Science Fiction Quarterly" was left in pulp format—Silberkleit felt that a quarterly digest would not be as successful as a quarterly pulp. The pulps were dying off, and when "<a href="Other%20Worlds%20%28magazine%29">Other Worlds</a>" switched to digest format in 1956, "Science Fiction Quarterly" became the only remaining sf magazine still being published as a pulp. In 1957 <a href="American%20News%20Company">American News Company</a>, one of the biggest magazine distributors, was liquidated, and the resulting changes in the national magazine distribution network, along with poor sales, finally killed "Science Fiction Quarterly". The last issue was dated February 1958.

Silberkleit's magazines were given very limited budgets. Hornig worked with <a href="Julius%20Schwartz">Julius Schwartz</a>, a literary agent who was a friend of his; this gave him access to stories by the writers Schwartz represented, but Schwartz would not allow his authors' real names to be used unless they were paid at least one cent per word. Hornig could not afford to pay the one cent rate for everything he bought, so he paid half a cent a word for much of what he acquired through Schwartz, and ran those stories under pseudonyms. Unsurprisingly, given the low rates, the stories sent to Hornig had usually already been rejected by the better-paying markets. The result was mediocre fiction, even from the better known writers that Hornig was able to attract. The magazines paid on publication, rather than acceptance, and this slower payment also discouraged some authors from submitting material.

"Science Fiction Quarterly" was intended by Silberkleit to include a full-length novel in each issue. Silberkleit obtained permission from Hugo Gernsback to reprint two novels from "Science Wonder Quarterly": "The Moon Conquerors" by R.H. Romans, and "The Shot Into Infinity" by <a href="Otto%20Willi%20Gail">Otto Willi Gail</a>. Although these stories were somewhat dated, they were better quality than the fiction Hornig was able to obtain for his other magazines. When Lowndes took over, the policy of including a novel in every issue continued, and Silberkleit again obtained reprint rights to fill some of these slots, this time with <a href="Ray%20Cummings">Ray Cummings</a>, five of whose novels would appear in "Science Fiction Quarterly" over the next two years, starting with "Tarrano the Conqueror" in the Summer 1941 issue. Lowndes bought many stories from the Futurians to fill the remaining space in the magazine. These were of variable quality, but overall "Science Fiction Quarterly" improved once Lowndes took control, and the fiction was as good as or better than the stories to be found in many of the contemporary magazines.

When the magazine was revived, the stated policy was still to publish lead novels and fill the remaining space with short stories, but in fact, with few exceptions, the lead fiction was not of novel length. There were no more reprints, as there had been for the first series. Lowndes was unable to pay his writers rates that were competitive with the magazines that were leading the field, but he was an able editor and produced a magazine of reasonable quality every quarter. The Futurians still occasionally appeared in "Science Fiction Quarterly", but Lowndes also attracted some of the newer writers, such as <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>, <a href="William%20Tenn">William Tenn</a>, and <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>. Clarke's "Second Dawn", which appeared in the August 1951 issue, is among the better stories Lowndes was able to obtain; he also published Isaac Asimov's "<a href="The%20Last%20Question">The Last Question</a>" in the November 1956 issue, and James Blish's "<a href="Common%20Time">Common Time</a>", in August 1953. Lowndes was also able to acquire some good quality nonfiction for the magazine, including a series of articles by James Blish on science in sf, and articles on science fiction by <a href="Thomas%20D.%20Clareson">Thomas D. Clareson</a> and <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>. Blish, writing as William Atheling, Jr., commented in 1953 that Lowndes was doing a "surprisingly good job" with all of Silberkleit's science fiction magazines, despite the low rates and the slow payment to authors.

Charles Hornig was the editor of the first two issues of the first incarnation of "Science Fiction Quarterly"; Robert W. Lowndes edited all the subsequent issues. The magazine was printed in pulp format throughout both series. The price was 25 cents throughout the first run, for 144 pages; the second series began at 25 cents, but the price increased to 35 cents for the August 1957 issue. The page count for the second series was 128 pages for much of the run, but from the November 1953 issue to the May 1957 issue it was 96 pages. The publisher for the first issue was <a href="Double%20Action%20Magazines">Double Action Magazines</a>, with offices in Holyoke, Massachusetts; thereafter the publisher was <a href="Columbia%20Publications">Columbia Publications</a> for both versions of the magazine. Both Double Action and Columbia were owned by Louis Silberkleit.
There were three British reprints of the first series, all published by Gerald Swan. The Summer 1940 issue was reprinted twice. It appeared first (with cuts) as "Yankee Science Fiction", issue 3, in February 1942, and then again, uncut, as a paperback, titled "The Moon Conqueror", in 1943. The Winter 1941/42 issue was also reprinted in 1943, titled "Into the Fourth Dimension and Other Stories".

Ten issues of the second series were reprinted in the U.K. by Thorpe & Porter. The issues, which were cut from the U.S. editions, appeared between February 1952 and August 1955, and corresponded to 10 of the first 13 issues, from May 1951 to May 1954. The omitted issues were November 1951, May 1952, and August 1953. The order of publication was not the same as for the US editions: the sequence was May 51/August 51/February 52/November 52/August 52/May 53/February 54/November 53/February 53/May 54. Each issue was 128 pages and was priced at <a href="%C2%A3sd">1/-</a> (5p).

There are no anthologies of stories drawn solely from "Science Fiction Quarterly." However, in the 1960s <a href="Ivan%20Howard%20%28writer%29">Ivan Howard</a> edited several anthologies for Silberkleit's publishing imprint, <a href="Belmont%20Books">Belmont Books</a>, with contents drawn solely from Silberkleit's magazines. One of these, "Rare Science Fiction" (1963), included three stories from "Science Fiction Quarterly."

Battle of Lipantitlán

The Battle of Lipantitlán, also known as the Battle of Nueces Crossing, was fought along the <a href="Nueces%20River">Nueces River</a> on November 4, 1835 between the <a href="Mexican%20Army">Mexican Army</a> and <a href="Texian">Texian</a> insurgents, as part of the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>. After the Texian victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Goliad">Battle of Goliad</a>, only two Mexican garrisons remained in Texas, Fort Lipantitlán near <a href="San%20Patricio%2C%20Texas">San Patricio</a> and the <a href="Alamo%20Mission%20in%20San%20Antonio">Alamo Mission</a> at <a href="San%20Antonio%20de%20B%C3%A9xar">San Antonio de Béxar</a> (modern-day San Antonio in the U.S. state of Texas). Fearing that Lipantitlán could be used as a base for the Mexican army to retake Goliad and angry that two of his men were imprisoned there, Texian commander <a href="Philip%20Dimmitt">Philip Dimmitt</a> ordered his <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>, Captain <a href="Ira%20Westover">Ira Westover</a>, to capture the fort.

The commander of Fort Lipantitlán, Nicolás Rodríguez, had been ordered to harass the Texian troops at Goliad. Rodríguez took the bulk of his men on an expedition; while they were gone, Westover's force arrived in San Patricio. On November 3, a local man persuaded the Mexican garrison to surrender, and the following day the Texians dismantled the fort. Rodríguez returned as the Texians were crossing the swollen <a href="Nueces%20River">Nueces River</a> to return to Goliad. The Mexican soldiers attacked, but the longer range of the Texians rifles soon forced them to retreat. One Texian was injured, 3–5 Mexican soldiers were killed, and 14–17 were wounded.

The injured Mexican troops were allowed to seek medical treatment in San Patricio, and the remaining Mexican soldiers retreated to <a href="Matamoros%2C%20Coahuila">Matamoros</a>. The Texians now had full control of the Texas <a href="Gulf%20Coast">Gulf Coast</a>, which meant that the troops stationed at San Antonio de Béxar could only receive reinforcements and supplies overland. Historian Bill Groneman believes that this contributed to the eventual Mexican defeat at the <a href="siege%20of%20B%C3%A9xar">siege of Béxar</a>, which expelled all Mexican troops from Texas. The former site of the fort is now a Texas historic site.

Fort Lipantitlán was built on the grounds of an old campsite along the west bank of the <a href="Nueces%20River">Nueces River</a> on the <a href="Gulf%20coast">Gulf coast</a> of <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Texas</a>. The site was first occupied by a nomadic <a href="Lipan%20Apache%20people">Lipan Apache</a> tribe during their periodic visits. After the Apaches abandoned the area, the campground was often used by missionaries, military units, and traders making their way between Mexico and the Texas settlements. In 1825 or 1826, Mexican officials constructed a makeshift fort, named Lipantitlán after the Lipan Apaches, at the campsite. According to <a href="Texian">Texian</a> <a href="John%20J.%20Linn">John J. Linn</a>, the fort "was a single embankment of earth, lined within by fence rails to hold the dirt in place, and would have answered tolerably well, perhaps, for a second-rate hog pen". The embankment was surrounded by a large ditch; just outside the ditch lay adobe and wooden huts for the officers and their families.

Between 80 and 125 soldiers from the 2nd Active (Cavalry) Company of Tamaulipas were garrisoned at the fort. They collected customs duties and provided protection to <a href="San%20Patricio%2C%20TX">San Patricio</a>, a small settlement of <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> and Mexican colonists approximately south. Smaller garrisons were located at <a href="Copano%20Bay">Copano Bay</a> and <a href="Refugio%2C%20TX">Refugio</a>, with a larger force stationed at <a href="Presidio%20La%20Bah%C3%ADa">Presidio La Bahía</a> in <a href="Goliad%2C%20TX">Goliad</a>.

In 1835, <a href="federalism">federalists</a> in several interior Mexican states revolted against the increasingly <a href="Centralized%20government">centralist</a> reign of Mexican President <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a>. The Texians staged a minor revolt against customs duties in June, and wary colonists soon began forming militias, ostensibly to protect themselves. Fearing that strong measures were needed to quell the unrest, Santa Anna ordered General <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20Perfecto%20de%20Cos">Martín Perfecto de Cos</a> to lead a large force into Texas; Cos arrived in Texas on September 20.

The <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a> officially began on October 2 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gonzales">Battle of Gonzales</a>. Within days, Texian insurgents <a href="Battle%20of%20Goliad">seized Presidio La Bahía</a>, located at <a href="Goliad%2C%20TX">Goliad</a>. Twenty Mexican soldiers escaped and briefly took refuge at Copano and <a href="Refugio%2C%20TX">Refugio</a>; those garrisons soon abandoned their posts and joined the larger force at Fort Lipantitlán. The Mexican soldiers at Lipantitlán began improving the defenses of their small fort. As the only remaining garrison on the Texas coast, Fort Lipantitlán was a vital link between the Mexican interior and Béxar, the political center of Texas which housed Cos and the only other force of Mexican troops in Texas.

Captain <a href="Philip%20Dimmitt">Philip Dimmitt</a> assumed command of the Texians at Presidio La Bahía. In a letter to General <a href="Stephen%20F.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a> dated October 15, Dimmitt proposed an attack on Fort Lipantitlán, whose capture would "secure the frontier, provide a vital station for defense, create instability among the centralists, and encourage Mexican federalists". Most of the federalists in San Patricio were afraid of retaliation if they openly defied Santa Anna's centralist policies. They were also reluctant to hold elections for delegates to the <a href="Consultation%20%28Texas%29">Consultation</a>, which would decide whether Texians were fighting for reinstatement of the <a href="Constitution%20of%201824">Constitution of 1824</a> or for independence from Mexico. Soldiers at Lipantitlán had also imprisoned two of Dimmitt's men, John Williams and John Toole, as they tried to deliver missives to the federalist leaders in San Patricio on October 10 and 11. Dimmitt hoped to free the men after capturing Fort Lipantitlán.

On October 20, <a href="James%20Power%20%28empresario%29">James Power</a>, one of the Irish <a href="empresario">empresario</a>s who had helped to found San Patricio, learned that the Lipantitlán soldiers had been ordered to retake Presidio La Bahia. Two hundred cavalry were expected to reinforce the Lipantitlán garrison before the attack, with an additional 200–300 soldiers expected later. Although Dimmitt forwarded the intelligence to Austin, he was not given authorization to attack. The delay proved costly to Williams and Toole, who were marched to the Mexican interior, beyond the reach of the Texians. According to Dimmitt's angry letter to Austin, Toole begged his captors to kill him outright rather than send him on the march, which he believed would still result in his death. Dimmitt concluded, "this news, after the leniency shown to the prisoners taken here, could not fail to create a lively, and a strong excitement. The men under my command are clamorous for retaliation".

The furor over the removal of Williams and Toole likely led Dimmitt to take matters into his own hands. On October 31 he sent a member of his staff, <a href="Adjutant">Adjutant</a> Ira Westover, to take 35 men to attack Fort Lipantitlán. A self-appointed advisory committee—John J. Linn, Major <a href="James%20Kerr%20%28Texas%29">James Kerr</a> and Power—rode along. The three advisors had been elected to the Consultation but delayed their departure so that they could participate in the fighting.

Rather than riding directly southwest to the fort, Westover travelled southeast to Refugio. This alternative route was likely intended to suggest that the expedition was headed for Copano Bay. An unknown number of men joined the expedition in Refugio; historian Craig Roell believes that the expedition grew by at least 20 men, and historian Bill Groneman estimated that Westover's force numbered 60–70 men when it reached San Patricio.

Meanwhile, the commander of the garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, Captain Nicolás Rodríguez, received orders to harass the Texians at Presidio La Bahía. On October 31, as Rodríguez and his men neared Goliad, they learned that a Texian force had left the fort earlier that day. The Mexican soldiers immediately retraced their route. They did not encounter any Texian soldiers during their march and arrived on November 1 to find the fort unmolested. Uncertain as to what the Texians intended to do, Rodríguez and the bulk of his garrison (almost 80 men) turned back towards Goliad to attempt to intercept the Texians. Between 21 and 27 soldiers, armed with two cannon, remained to defend the fort.

Rodríguez expected the Texians to take a direct route. his men patrolled the northern approaches to the fort. Westover's men instead approached from the east, eluding the Mexican patrols. Five miles (8 km) from San Patricio, Westover received word that Rodríguez was searching for the Texians. He forced the men to increase their pace, and they arrived at San Patricio 30 minutes after sundown on November 3. Westover positioned two small groups of men to guard the Nueces River crossings, about from the fort. As the rest of the Texians prepared for a dawn assault, two San Patricio residents wandered into their camp. Westover arrested one of them, James O'Riley, for "aiding and assisting the enemy". In exchange for his liberty, O'Riley offered to persuade the Mexican garrison to surrender. Historians have no records of what methods O'Riley used, but by 11 pm the Mexican soldiers had surrendered, without a shot fired. They were released immediately as long as they promised not to fight again during the Texas Revolution. The Texians captured the two 4-lb (1.8-kg) cannons, 18 muskets, and 3–4 pounds (1.4–1.8 kg) of powder. They also released several Texians who had been held prisoner in the fort.

The following day, Texians burned the wooden huts adjacent to the fort and dismantled the embankments. By 3 pm they had rounded up 14 horses and were preparing to bring the cannons back to Goliad. In the meantime, Rodriguez had travelled almost all the way to Goliad. Before he reached Presidio La Bahía, one of his spies arrived with news that the Texians had taken Fort Lipantitlán. Rodriguez and his men—including 10 colonists from San Patricio—marched back toward the fort, arriving at about 4 pm.

The Texians used a small canoe to transport men across the Nueces River, and when the Mexican soldiers were sighted only half of the Texian force had crossed to the east bank of the river. As the Mexican soldiers attacked, the Texians took cover in a grove of trees. The trees prevented the cavalry from approaching, so Rodriguez's men dismounted and attempted to attack from both sides. The Texian rifles had a much longer range than the Mexican <a href="Brown%20Bess">Brown Bess</a> muskets— compared to . After 30 minutes of fighting, the Mexicans withdrew, leaving behind 8 horses and several wounded men. The only Texian injured was Lieutenant William Bracken, who lost three fingers. Texian rifleman A. J. Jones later wrote to Fannin that 3 Mexicans had died with 14 wounded, though historian <a href="Stephen%20Hardin">Stephen Hardin</a> believes that 5 Mexicans died with 17 wounded. Jones's letter mentioned that three of the wounded were the "<a href="alcalde">alcalde</a>", judge, and sheriff of San Patricio.

Without draft animals, the Texians had no easy way to transport the artillery. As night approached, a cold rain began to fall, and the men became discouraged. Westover, Kerr, Linn, and Power agreed to throw the artillery in the river rather than continue to struggle with it. The Texians also deposited their cache of captured ammunition and muskets in the river; in their opinion, the supplies were useless.

Most Texians spent the night in San Patricio, housed by sympathetic locals. The Mexican troops camped outdoors near the battle site. At dawn, Westover agreed to allow the wounded Mexican soldiers to be transported to San Patricio for treatment. The following day one of the wounded soldiers, Mexican Lieutenant Marcellino Garcia, died. Garcia was a personal friend of Linn, and the Texians gave him a full burial with honors.

Westover sent a messenger to Rodríguez to request "another pleasant meeting". Rodríguez declined the offer and retreated with his remaining men to Matamoros. Their departure left only one remaining group of Mexican soldiers in Texas, those under General Cos at Béxar. The Texians now controlled the Gulf Coast, and so all communication between Cos and the Mexican interior must be transferred overland. The long distance involved severely slowed the delivery of messages and receipt of supplies and reinforcements. According to Groneman, this likely contributed to Cos's defeat in the <a href="siege%20of%20B%C3%A9xar">siege of Béxar</a>, which expelled the remaining Mexican soldiers from Texas.

On their return to Goliad, Westover's group encountered <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Viesca">Agustín Viesca</a>, the recently deposed governor of <a href="Coahuila%20y%20Tejas">Coahuila y Tejas</a>. Several months before, Viesca had been imprisoned by the Mexican army for defying attempts by Santa Anna to disband the state legislature. He and members of his cabinet had been liberated by sympathetic soldiers and immediately travelled to Texas to recreate the state government. Westover and his men provided a military escort to Goliad, arriving on November 12. Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor. This caused an uproar in the garrison; many supported the governor, while others believed that Texas should be an independent country and should therefore not recognize the Mexican governor.

Dimmitt later chastised Westover for not following orders during the expedition. Westover refused to make an official report to Dimmitt. Instead, he sent a written report to <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a>, the commander-in-chief of the regular army. In Westover's opinion, "The men all fought bravely and those on the opposite bank of the river were enabled to operate on the flanks of the enemy above and below the crossing which they did with fine effect." Houston lauded "the conduct and bravery of the officers and men who have so handsomely acquitted themselves in the affair and so deservedly won [a] reputation for themselves and Glory for their Country". This was the first armed skirmish fought since the <a href="Battle%20of%20Goliad">Battle of Goliad</a>, according to historian Hobart Huson, the victory "renewed the morale of the people". News of the battle spread throughout the United States, and the Texians were widely praised in American newspapers.

The removal of Mexican army oversight encouraged federalists in San Patricio. These men soon gained control of the municipal government, formed a militia, and elected delegates to represent them at the Consultation. However, the town remained divided; many still supported the centralist Mexican government. After reaching Matamoros, Rodríguez sent a letter to the town leaders. The letter warned that the Mexican army would return and encouraged the people of San Patricio to repudiate the rebellion. One of the San Patricio federalists later wrote Dimmitt, "We have neither men nor means to withstand any force that may be sent against us." The Texians chose not to garrison men in or near San Patricio. In 1836, as part of Santa Anna's invasion of Texas, General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Urrea">José de Urrea</a> led Mexican forces along the Texas coastline and <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Patricio">retook San Patricio</a> on February 27.

In 1937, the land comprising the former site of Fort Lipantitlán was donated to the state of Texas. The <a href="Texas%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20Department">Texas State Parks Board</a> gained control over the site in 1949. Now named the <a href="Lipantitlan%20State%20Historic%20Site">Lipantitlan State Historic Site</a>, the park covers in <a href="Nueces%20County%2C%20Texas">Nueces County</a>. A stone marker indicates the location of the former fort.

Oakwood Cemetery (Troy, New York)

Oakwood Cemetery is a <a href="nonsectarian">nonsectarian</a> <a href="rural%20cemetery">rural cemetery</a> in northeastern <a href="Troy%2C%20New%20York">Troy, New York</a>, United States. It operates under the direction of the Troy Cemetery Association, a <a href="non-profit">non-profit</a> <a href="board%20of%20directors">board of directors</a> that deals strictly with the operation of the cemetery. It was established in 1848 in response to the growing rural cemetery movement in <a href="New%20England">New England</a> and went into service in 1850. The cemetery was designed by architect John C. Sidney and underwent its greatest development in the late 19th century under superintendent John Boetcher, who incorporated rare foliage and a clear landscape design strategy. Oakwood was the fourth rural cemetery opened in New York and its governing body was the first rural cemetery association created in the state.

It features four man-made lakes, two residential structures, a <a href="chapel">chapel</a>, a <a href="crematorium">crematorium</a>, 24 <a href="mausolea">mausolea</a>, and about 60,000 <a href="grave%20%28burial%29">graves</a>, and has about of roads. It is known both for its dense foliage and rolling lawns, and has historically been used as a <a href="public%20park">public park</a> by <a href="Lansingburgh%2C%20New%20York">Lansingburgh</a> and Troy residents. Oakwood was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1984.

Prominent Americans such as <a href="Samuel%20Wilson">Uncle Sam Wilson</a>, <a href="Russell%20Sage">Russell Sage</a>, and <a href="Emma%20Willard">Emma Willard</a>, at least fourteen members of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>, and the founders of both Troy and Lansingburgh are buried at Oakwood. The cemetery has been said to be "one of New York State's most distinguished and well-preserved nineteenth-century rural cemeteries." It also offers a famous panoramic view of the <a href="Hudson%20River%20Valley">Hudson River Valley</a> that is said to be the "most concentrated and complete overview of American history anywhere in America".

The first rural cemetery in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>—<a href="Mount%20Auburn%20Cemetery">Mount Auburn Cemetery</a> in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>—was developed in the 1830s. Rural cemeteries are burial grounds typically located on the fringe of a city that offer a natural setting for <a href="interment">interment</a> of the dead. The development of rural cemeteries followed closely with the <a href="English%20garden">English garden movement</a> of the early 19th century.
The Troy Cemetery Association was formed on September 9, 1848; John Paine, D. Thomas Vail, Isaac McConihe, George M. Tibbits, John B. Gale, and Stephen E. Warren were elected its trustees. It was the first rural cemetery association incorporated under an <a href="Rural%20Cemetery%20Act">1847 law</a> authorizing the incorporation of such associations. The trustees appointed a committee to report on an eligible location for a cemetery and on September 5, 1849, the first parcel of land was purchased. On October 16, 1850, the land of the cemetery was <a href="consecrated">consecrated</a> and Oakwood became the fourth <a href="rural%20cemetery">rural cemetery</a> founded in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. The Association is made up of lot owners who are elected by fellow lot owners; the position is voluntary and receives no pay.

Oakwood was designed by John C. Sidney, a <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> engineer familiar with cemetery design, with the help of <a href="Garnet%20Douglass%20Baltimore">Garnet Douglass Baltimore</a>, the first African American to earn a degree from <a href="Rensselaer%20Polytechnic%20Institute">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>. The plan consisted of roads, man-made lakes, dense vegetation, and rolling hills, covering about , including the modern sections A through Q. Sidney also designed the original superintendent's house and receiving tomb, neither of which exist today. For all Sidney's extensive planning, the first plots were laid out in a seemingly haphazard manner by the first superintendent, Robert Fergusson.

Although Sidney was the architect of the cemetery, it was superintendent John Boetcher that gave Oakwood its charm. Boetcher became superintendent in 1871 and continued in the position until 1898. At the beginning of his tenure, Oakwood was said to be quite crude. During Boetcher's tenure Oakwood's most important icons were built: the Earl Chapel and Crematorium, the Warren Chapel Mortuary, the keeper's house, the office lodge, numerous mausolea, and both the 101st Street and 114th Street entrances (including a bridge over the <a href="Troy%20and%20Boston%20Railroad">Troy and Boston Railroad</a> on Oakwood's western border to the 101st Street entrance). Boetcher incorporated exceptional landscape design techniques during his tenure; Oakwood developed shifting landscape scenery: some areas are dominated by flowing lawns while others comprise dense foliage. Boetcher brought in rare and foreign plants to help beautify the cemetery, including <a href="umbrella%20pine">umbrella pine</a>s and <a href="Colorado%20blue%20spruce">Colorado blue spruce</a>.

In 1869, the City of Troy bought the property of the Third Street Burying Ground for the site of a new city hall. This was the burial site for many of Troy's earliest inhabitants; the City had bought lot number 102 in Section N for re-interment of 146 graves. The Vanderheyden family and Jacob Lansing, founders of Troy and Lansingburgh respectively, were re-interred in Oakwood from private, family cemeteries. With these re-interments, the graves within Oakwood span the entire the history of Troy. Although it was a cemetery by definition, Oakwood quickly became a place for recreation and was used in its early days as a public park. In response to its popularity, many memorials include benches in their design, aimed to invite visitors to rest while enjoying their visit. So popular was Oakwood that in 1908 the Association began a <a href="stage%20coach">stage</a> service between the Oakwood Avenue and 114th Street entrances.

A section of Oakwood was nominated for the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in August 1984 and was added to the Register on October 10, 1984. The cemetery originally owned about on the east side of Oakwood Avenue, but sold the land in two transactions in the 2000s (decade). The land deals were made to increase the Association's operating income. As of 2009, the cemetery contained roughly 60,000 graves and its numbers continue to grow. The Association expects to be able to accept interments until at least the early 23rd century.

 Oakwood is built on an <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a> that rises east of the <a href="plain">fluvial plain</a> surrounding the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>, opposite the confluence of the Hudson and <a href="Mohawk%20River">Mohawk</a>. It is in eastern <a href="Lansingburgh%2C%20New%20York">Lansingburgh</a>, within the northeast section of the city of Troy. Its western edge is dominated by a steep, densely vegetated hill that descends to the city below while the central and eastern portions of the cemetery comprise rolling hills graced with trees and vegetation that include four man-made ponds created by damming local streams. The property is generally long and thin, running approximately north-south along Oakwood Avenue (<a href="New%20York%20Route%2040">New York Route 40</a>).

The cemetery covers of which contribute to the listing on the National Register of Historic Places. In the east-west direction, the cemetery extends from Gurley Avenue and the bed of the old Troy and Boston Railroad on the west, to Oakwood Avenue on the east. The northern boundary is Farrell Road Extension and the southern boundary is a line that extends due east from a point just south of 101st Street, to Oakwood Avenue.

The cemetery is split into sections for ease of finding graves which, for the most part, follow an alphabetic (e.g. Section K) or alphanumeric (e.g. Section D-3) naming system, though there are some that follow a numeric scheme. The sections are split by paved and gravel roads and pedestrian paths that total .

There are three operating entrances to the cemetery. The main entrance is on Oakwood Avenue at the southern tip of the property; it is flanked by the keeper's house. The 114th Street entrance is marked only by a gate and connects to Gurley Avenue. The 101st Street entrance passes the office lodge.

The large amount of space in rural cemeteries permits the use of sculpture in a way that the crowded <a href="churchyard">churchyard</a> has never allowed. Many rural cemeteries, including Oakwood, subsequently became virtual outdoor sculpture museums, displaying the works of well-known contemporary sculptors as memorials to the deceased. Oakwood is home to thousands of individual statues and sculptures as well as 24 private mausolea. Because of its popularity as a public park, many memorials included benches to invite visitors to rest while investigating the large, hilly property.
Many historically important sculptors are represented on the grounds of Oakwood. <a href="Robert%20E.%20Launitz">Robert E. Launitz</a>, creator of the for <a href="A.%20J.%20Downing">A. J. Downing</a> on the <a href="National%20Mall">National Mall</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BC.">Washington, D. C.</a>, sculpted the memorial for Major General <a href="George%20H.%20Thomas">George H.

One of the most significant monuments is that to Major General <a href="John%20E.%20Wool">John E. Wool</a>. The monolithic <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a> which was a technological marvel in its day is constructed from <a href="granite">granite</a> quarried and shaped by the Bodwell Granite Company of <a href="Vinalhaven%2C%20Maine">Vinalhaven, Maine</a>, and at 650 tons was believed to be the largest shaft quarried in the United States up to that time. It was transported to Troy by boat and brought to the cemetery on rollers. This and the many other obelisks in the cemetery exhibit the sentiment and taste of the <a href="Victorian%20Era">Victorian</a> and <a href="Edwardian%20Era">Edwardian</a> eras.

In 1862 the Troy Cemetery Association set aside an area in Section P, called the Soldiers' Plot, for deceased <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Navy">Navy</a> officers and soldiers from <a href="Rensselaer%20County">Rensselaer County</a>.

The most significant building on the property is the Gardner Earl Memorial Chapel and Crematorium, a <a href="Richardsonian%20Romanesque">Richardsonian Romanesque</a> structure built between 1887 and 1889, which sits near the edge of the escarpment about above the Hudson. The building was financed by William S. Earl, a successful Troy manufacturer, as a memorial to his son who became ill and died on a trip to <a href="Europe">Europe</a> in March 1887. The deceased son was an early promoter of <a href="cremation">cremation</a> and was himself cremated in <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo</a>.

The building consists of a <a href="bell%20tower">bell tower</a> with an square base on the south side, connected by a triple-arched <a href="loggia">loggia</a> to a <a href="chapel">chapel</a> and <a href="crematorium">crematorium</a> on the north side. The floor plan of the entire building measures . The exterior is covered by a pink-tinted <a href="Westerly%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Westerly</a> <a href="granite">granite</a> and the <a href="foundation%20%28engineering%29">foundation</a> sits completely on <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a>.

The interior is noted for its sumptuous and intricate design. The original furnace room was transformed into an elaborately designed reception room in 1889, the furnaces having been moved into a separate room. This features significant use of marble, from <a href="Siena">Siena</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, and <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, on its walls, floors, and molding. "The Troy Daily Times" stated on November 7, 1889, that, "the chapel is a model of architectural and mechanical skill," and that the chapel's reception room "is certainly the equal, and possibly in respect to artistic detail and elaborateness of execution, the superior of any church interior in the land."

The interior of the chapel is marked by quartered oak ceilings, bluestone floors, and five original <a href="Louis%20Comfort%20Tiffany">Tiffany</a> <a href="stained%20glass%20window">stained glass window</a>s. The <a href="chancel">chancel</a> contains an <a href="onyx">onyx</a> <a href="altar">altar</a> and <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> floor made of more than twenty colors of marble.

The Earl Crematorium was listed in its own right on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 and was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> on March 5, 2012.

The Warren Family Mortuary Chapel is a stone chapel built on a knoll near the center of the cemetery. It was designed by <a href="Henry%20Dudley">Henry Dudley</a> of New York City and built in 1860 in the <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture">English country Gothic style</a>, complete with a <a href="nave">nave</a> and <a href="transept">transept</a> floor plan. A tower was added in 1883, with great care placed on finding building material that matched the earlier structure. The Chapel contains stained glass windows above the altar designed by artist <a href="Robert%20Walter%20Weir">Robert Walter Weir</a>. Former member of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> <a href="Joseph%20Mabbett%20Warren">Joseph Mabbett Warren</a> (1813–1896) is interred in the chapel.

The Vanderheyden Bell, a memorial itself, is located northeast of the Earl Crematorium. It is a bronze, cast bell weighing more than . Its original home was under a log shelter on the premises. At some point, it was placed into storage. In 1971 it was resurrected and hung among four <a href="Sequoia%20sempervirens">redwood</a> posts, becoming an additional "tower" on the property.

Oakwood is home to 24 mausolea and <a href="Burial%20vault%20%28tomb%29">burial vaults</a> exhibiting a wide range of architectural styles including <a href="Greek%20Revival">Greek Revival</a>, <a href="Egyptian%20Revival">Egyptian Revival</a>, <a href="Roman%20Revival">Roman Revival</a>, <a href="Gothic%20Revival">Gothic Revival</a>, <a href="Romanesque%20Revival%20architecture">Romanesque</a>, and <a href="Palladian">Palladian</a>.

"The Panorama" is an <a href="panorama">panoramic photograph</a> created by local photographer Tom Wall and set in acrylic on a steel stand in the cemetery's northwestern section. It sits at the edge of a bluff directly overlooking the grounds of Lansingburgh High School and Knickerbacker Middle School. The photograph spans a view and contains labels and notes—referred to by the Troy Cemetery Association as "cliff notes"—about the history of objects shown in the photograph. From this point, one can view <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a> and the <a href="Empire%20State%20Plaza">Empire State Plaza</a> (most notably the <a href="Corning%20Tower">Corning Tower</a> and <a href="Alfred%20E.%20Smith%20Building">Alfred E.

Caversham, New Zealand

Caversham is one of the older suburbs of the city of <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a>, in New Zealand's <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a>. It is sited at the western edge of the city's central plain at the mouth of the steep Caversham Valley, which rises to the <a href="saddle%20%28landform%29">saddle</a> of Lookout Point. Major road and rail routes south lie nearby; the <a href="South%20Island%20Main%20Trunk">South Island Main Trunk</a> railway runs through the suburb, and a <a href="bypass%20%28road%29">bypass</a> skirts its main retail area, connecting Dunedin's one-way street system with the <a href="Dunedin%20Southern%20Motorway">Dunedin Southern Motorway</a>. The suburb is linked by several bus routes to its neighbouring suburbs and central Dunedin.

The suburb was founded by wealthy pioneer <a href="William%20Henry%20Valpy">William Henry Valpy</a>, and its name reflects his family connections with the town of <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a>, in the <a href="England">English</a> county of <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>. Caversham grew rapidly during the <a href="Central%20Otago%20Gold%20Rush">Central Otago Gold Rush</a> of the 1860s because of its location on routes south to the <a href="Otago">Otago</a> hinterland. By the end of the 19th century, Caversham was heavily industrialised, and its population included many skilled or semi-skilled tradespeople. This, combined with the community's strong <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> roots, led to the area's generally left-leaning political stance. Caversham's early history has been the subject of the Caversham Project, a major historical and archaeological study by the <a href="University%20of%20Otago">University of Otago</a>. Caversham was a separate borough until 1904, when it was amalgamated with <a href="Dunedin%20City%20Council">Dunedin city</a>. It is currently administered as part of the city's South Dunedin ward. At a national level, it is part of the <a href="Dunedin%20South">Dunedin South</a> electorate.

Caversham is now predominantly residential, with some industrial premises in the east (notably the <a href="Hillside%20Railway%20Workshops">Hillside Railway Workshops</a>) and a retail district centred on South Road and Hillside Road. Residents are generally of low socio-economic status. Caversham's notable buildings include the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Historic%20Places%20Trust">heritage listed</a> Lisburn House and several prominent church buildings. Another landmark is the suburb's war memorial, which is the main gate of Caversham School, one of the suburb's two primary schools. Caversham also contains a <a href="Special%20education">special needs school</a>. The nearest secondary schools are located in <a href="St%20Clair%2C%20New%20Zealand">St Clair</a>, to the south.

Caversham has strong sporting connections, and is the location of <a href="Carisbrook">Carisbrook</a>, until recently one of the city's main sports venues. The suburb is home to the Southern Rugby Football Club, and gives its name to <a href="Caversham%20%28soccer%29">Caversham Football Club</a>. Several notable sportspeople have associations with Caversham, among them <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a>er <a href="Clarrie%20Grimmett">Clarrie Grimmett</a> and father and son <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> administrators <a href="Vic%20Cavanagh%20%28born%201874%29">"Old Vic"</a> and <a href="Vic%20Cavanagh%20%28born%201909%29">"Young Vic" Cavanagh</a>. Other notable people with Caversham connections include politician <a href="Thomas%20Kay%20Sidey">Thomas Kay Sidey</a>, architect <a href="Edmund%20Anscombe">Edmund Anscombe</a>, and surveyor <a href="John%20Turnbull%20Thomson">John Turnbull Thomson</a>.

Caversham lies at the mouth and in the lower reaches of a valley in the west of <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a>'s main urban area, southwest of the city centre, and north of the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a> coast at <a href="Saint%20Clair%2C%20New%20Zealand">St Clair</a>. To the south lies Calton Hill, a spur of Forbury Hill, on which the suburbs of <a href="Calton%20Hill%2C%20New%20Zealand">Calton Hill</a>, <a href="Corstorphine%2C%20New%20Zealand">Corstorphine</a> and <a href="Kew%2C%20Otago">Kew</a> are located.

The suburbs of <a href="Balaclava%2C%20New%20Zealand">Balaclava</a> and <a href="Maryhill%2C%20New%20Zealand">Maryhill</a> lie to the north, close to the western end of the ridge that runs along the northern edge of central Dunedin. These hills were all once part of the rim of the Dunedin volcano, the long-extinct crater of which now forms <a href="Otago%20Harbour">Otago Harbour</a>. Other suburbs nearby include <a href="Forbury%2C%20New%20Zealand">Forbury</a>, <a href="South%20Dunedin">South Dunedin</a>, <a href="Kensington%2C%20New%20Zealand">Kensington</a>, and Lookout Point.

Caversham Valley has long been the major route out of the central city to the south. The suburb is located close to the start of the <a href="Dunedin%20Southern%20Motorway">Dunedin Southern Motorway</a> (part of <a href="New%20Zealand%20State%20Highway%201">State Highway 1</a>), the main road access to central Dunedin from the south, and close to the <a href="South%20Island%20Main%20Trunk">South Island Main Trunk</a> railway. The creation of the <a href="Dunedin%20Southern%20Motorway">Dunedin Southern Motorway</a> redirected traffic away from South Road, the main thoroughfare through Caversham.

The railway provides the suburb's most important industry, through the <a href="Hillside%20Railway%20Workshops">Hillside Railway Workshops</a>, which are located in the southeast of the suburb and in the adjoining suburb of <a href="South%20Dunedin">South Dunedin</a>. Despite this, there are no longer any public railway stations or <a href="Train%20station%23Halt">halts</a> in Caversham, the last station having closed in 1962.

The hill slopes to the north of Caversham are less densely populated, and still retain some tree cover. This, along with the steepness of the land, forms a natural barrier between Caversham and the suburb of Maryhill. Only a few winding roads traverse this barrier, most notably Glen Road, at the eastern end of Caversham. At this end, the suburb draws close to the foot of the hills, and a natural valley, known locally as "The Glen", provides easier road access to the hill ridge.

To the northeast of the Glen, a hill spur including a cliff separates Caversham from the central part of the city. Though the name is rarely used, this spur is called Montecillo Ridge, named for the mansion of early settler W.H. Reynolds. It is occasionally referred to as "Hillside", after the house of the city's founding father Captain <a href="William%20Cargill">William Cargill</a> which was located here. This ridge overlooks "The Flat", as the plain stretching across to the Pacific coast was (and is still) locally known. South Road winds around the spur, connecting with the southern end of <a href="Princes%20Street%2C%20Dunedin">Princes Street</a>. One of the city's older and more historic cemeteries, <a href="Dunedin%20Southern%20Cemetery">Dunedin Southern Cemetery</a>, lies on the inner city side of this spur.

At the top of Caversham Valley are a <a href="ridge">ridge</a> and the <a href="Saddle%20%28landform%29">saddle</a> of Lookout Point. Lookout Point commands views to the southwest past the outer suburbs of <a href="Burnside%2C%20Otago">Burnside</a> and <a href="Green%20Island%2C%20New%20Zealand">Green Island</a> to <a href="Saddle%20Hill%2C%20New%20Zealand">Saddle Hill</a>, as well as providing a view to the east across the southern part of the central city to Otago Harbour and the <a href="Otago%20Peninsula">Otago Peninsula</a>.

The most prominent building in Lookout Point is the local fire station, which also serves both Caversham and Green Island. This 1956 structure is located immediately to the north of the saddle and is a prominent landmark upon entering or leaving Dunedin. Not far from the fire station to the north-east is Dunedin's tallest tree, a eucalyptus measuring an estimated 100 metres. The <a href="Dunedin%20Southern%20Motorway">Dunedin Southern Motorway</a> officially begins at the Lookout Point saddle, between Calton Hill and Maryhill, and sweeps down over broken hill country past Green Island to <a href="Mosgiel">Mosgiel</a> and the <a href="Taieri%20Plains">Taieri Plains</a>.

Lookout Point is also the home of the former Caversham Industrial School, located to the northeast of the fire station on Mornington Road. Established in 1869, the school was later a boys' home, and is now an <a href="adult%20education">adult training centre</a>. Lookout Point's main streets include South Road, Caversham Valley Road, Riselaw Road, and Mornington Road.

The <a href="M%C4%81ori%20language">Māori</a> name for Lookout Point is "Ko Raka-a-runga-te-raki". It was the burial site of chief Rangi-Ihia, a late 18th-century <a href="Kati%20Mamoe">Kati Mamoe</a> chief who was largely responsible for joining the <a href="Kai%20Tahu">Kai Tahu</a> and Kati Mamoe <a href="iwi">iwi</a>. He was buried here so that "his spirit might see thence his old haunts to the southward."

A forest reserve is located on the upper slopes of Caversham Valley below Lookout Point. Purchased by the <a href="Dunedin%20City%20Council">Dunedin City Council</a> in 1994 with the assistance of the <a href="Royal%20Forest%20and%20Bird%20Protection%20Society">Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society</a>, it is home to various native bird and <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> species, including one species of <a href="Onychophora">velvet worm</a> believed to be endemic to the Dunedin area.

Caversham was named for <a href="Caversham%2C%20Berkshire">Caversham, Berkshire</a>, a suburb of <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a>, by <a href="William%20Henry%20Valpy">William Henry Valpy</a>, a wealthy early settler who farmed the areas around the lower slopes of Forbury Hill; his initial farm, "The Forbury", was located in what is now <a href="Saint%20Clair%2C%20New%20Zealand">St Clair</a>, close to a street which now bears his name. A member of Valpy's family was born in the <a href="England">English</a> Caversham.

In the early days of Dunedin, it was impossible for a <a href="wagon">dray</a> to reach the Caversham Valley in wet weather unless it went by a circuitous route around the hills. Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his own expense to build a crude road from the southern end of <a href="Princes%20Street%2C%20Dunedin">Princes Street</a> to his farm at Forbury. This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb. The road curved around the edge of the hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by <a href="Carisbrook">Carisbrook</a> sports ground.
Settlement in the area was slow, though Caversham Valley was a preferred route south out of the city. The <a href="Central%20Otago%20Gold%20Rush">Central Otago Gold Rush</a> of 1861 led to rapid changes when thousands of people began using the road on their way to and from the gold fields. The suburb began to expand rapidly at about this time, and the first <a href="public%20house">public house</a>, the Edinburgh Castle Hotel, was erected in 1861. By the end of the decade, Caversham had its own school, post office, <a href="drill%20hall">drill hall</a> (from the Southern District Rifles), and <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> and <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> churches. A third church, for the <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> denomination, followed in 1872.

Several charitable organisations have had properties in Caversham, including the Otago Benevolent Institution home for invalids, and an <a href="IHC%20New%20Zealand">IHC New Zealand</a> centre at Kew Park. The <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Foundation%20of%20the%20Blind">Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind</a> still has its Otago premises in Hillside Road.
Early industries in the area included C & W Sheil's brickworks, which had quarries in <a href="Forbury%2C%20New%20Zealand">Forbury</a>, St Clair and Caversham, and Caversham Gasworks, which operated from 1882 until 1909. The last buildings of the gasworks were a local landmark, and were not removed until the construction of the Caversham <a href="bypass%20%28road%29">bypass</a> in the 1970s and 1980s. Other noted industries in early Caversham included breweries, a tannery, and a match factory.

Construction of the <a href="South%20Island%20Main%20Trunk">South Island Main Trunk</a> railway south of Dunedin that began in 1871 led to the construction of a tunnel beneath Lookout Point, connecting Caversham with <a href="Green%20Island%2C%20New%20Zealand">Green Island</a>. A second parallel tunnel – the first double-track tunnel in the country – was built starting in 1907, and all rail traffic moved to the new tunnel in 1910. Caversham was served by its own railway station until its closure in 1962. There has been a long-running campaign to have the older tunnel converted into a cycleway, though this scheme has never gained wholehearted council support.

By the 1870s the population of Caversham was growing rapidly, and in 1877, with the population at around 4,000, it was declared a borough. It held this status until amalgamation with Dunedin city in 1904. The borough's area included much of modern Forbury and St Clair, as well as what is usually regarded as Caversham today.

The early history of the suburb and surrounding parts of southern Dunedin has been the subject of a major ongoing archaeological and historical research project into early Dunedin by the <a href="University%20of%20Otago">University of Otago</a>, known simply as The Caversham Project. Over the course of the last 30 years, a database has been compiled of life in early South Dunedin, focussing on the borough of Caversham. This database is unique in its size for a historical study within New Zealand or Australia, containing some 9.4 <a href="gigabyte">gigabyte</a>s of data, and has allowed for the examination and publication of details relating to the socioeconomic and demographic mix of early Dunedin.

The multidisciplinary nature of the study has resulted in information being gathered on subjects ranging from urban planning to gender studies. By using both quantitative and qualitative analyses, and by including considerable amounts of oral history, it has allowed for a vivid recreation of the society of early urban New Zealand. Several books have resulted from the project, among them "Sites of Gender: Women, Men and Modernity, 1890–1939", edited by B. Brookes, A. Cooper, and R. Law (Auckland University Press, 2003) and "Class and Occupation: The New Zealand Reality" by E. Olssen and M. Hickey (University of Otago Press, 2005).

In its formative days, the Caversham Road Board administered Caversham. This organisation served as a council for Caversham until May 1877, when it became a <a href="borough">borough</a>. The borough of Caversham, which existed until November 1904, took in a far larger area than the current suburb, including much of Saint Clair, South Dunedin, Kew, and Kensington, and stretched to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a> coast in the south and <a href="Otago%20Harbour">Otago Harbour</a> in the east. The names of several of the borough's mayors are commemorated in streets within the former borough, among them Robert Rutherford, William Bridgman, and <a href="Thomas%20Kay%20Sidey">Thomas Kay Sidey</a>.

The Dunedin City Council currently administers Caversham; the suburb is located in the city's South Dunedin ward, one of the city's six wards. This ward covers a considerable part of Dunedin's main urban area, as well as the entirety of the <a href="Otago%20Peninsula">Otago Peninsula</a>. It elects four councillors to Dunedin's 14-member city council.

At a national level, Caversham was a <a href="Caversham%20%28New%20Zealand%20electorate%29">separate electorate</a> from 1866 to 1908. <a href="Member%20of%20parliament">MPs</a> for the electorate included Thomas Kay Sidey and future <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand">Premier</a> <a href="Robert%20Stout">Robert Stout</a>. Since 1908 Caversham has been in various electorates, and is currently part of the <a href="Dunedin%20South">Dunedin South</a> electorate. , its <a href="Member%20of%20parliament">MP</a> is <a href="Clare%20Curran">Clare Curran</a> (<a href="New%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party">Labour</a>).

Unlike most of Dunedin, which was settled by Scots, many early settlers in Caversham were English. This led to some degree of antagonism by the councils of the city and Caversham borough in the early days of settlement; Dunedin had been settled by the <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> church, whereas Caversham's population was largely <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>, <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>, and <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a>. There is little evidence of this distinction in modern Caversham, other than the origins of local street names, several of which reflect the names of English counties and early English settlers.

Caversham began largely as a lower-middle to working-class suburb. Many of the early residents were skilled or semi-skilled tradespeople. In its early days, Caversham was known as "The carpenters' borough", as a high proportion of the skilled workers within the borough were employed in the building trade. The socioeconomic mix of the borough, combined with the Protestant religious make-up of Caversham, led to strong traditions of <a href="egalitarian">egalitarian</a> and social <a href="humanitarian">humanitarian</a> politics in the borough.

The left-leaning politics of the area is still reflected to some extent in local political views. The <a href="Dunedin%20South">Dunedin South</a> electorate, of which Caversham is a part, tends to return <a href="New%20Zealand%20Labour%20Party">New Zealand Labour Party</a> Members of Parliament and support this and other left-of-centre parties. In the <a href="New%20Zealand%20general%20election%2C%202008">2008 New Zealand general election</a>, 54.8% of valid party votes cast in Caversham's two polling stations were for the Labour Party and 10.4% were for the three other main left-of-centre parties (<a href="New%20Zealand%20Green%20Party">Green</a>, <a href="Alliance%20%28New%20Zealand%20political%20party%29">Alliance</a>, and <a href="Jim%20Anderton%27s%20Progressive%20Party">Progressive</a>). The vote for these parties over the whole Dunedin South electorate was 46.7% and 9.4% respectively. The equivalent figures for New Zealand as a whole were 34.0% and 7.7% respectively.

Many residents of Caversham are still of relatively low socio-economic status when compared to those in surrounding hill suburbs. A 2007 <a href="Dunedin%20City%20Council">Dunedin City Council</a> report indicated that a high proportion (39%) of the suburb's houses were one- or two-bedroom dwellings.

Caversham's 2006 population was 5,058. The suburb has a slightly higher proportion of elderly residents than the <a href="Otago">Otago</a> average, with 15.8% of residents aged 65 and over. It also has a considerably higher proportion of residents of Māori and Pacific island descent than the Otago average (10.3% and 4.4% respectively). Caversham also has nearly twice the average Otago proportion of one-parent families (26.5%). Ownership of and access to home telecommunications (such as the internet) and to private motor vehicles is considerably lower than the Otago average.

Caversham has no secondary schools, although it does contain two primary schools and a special needs school. Caversham Primary School, at the corner of South Road and Surrey Street, has been at its present site since 1921. The school dates back to the early 1860s, and has a current enrollment of around 80 pupils. The school's two-storey 1920s brick buildings were pulled down and replaced in 1961, because of their structural unsoundness. The school's main gate – the only surviving remnant of the earlier structure – is the suburb's war memorial.

College Street School, south of South Road's retail area, was built on an earlier site of Caversham Primary School. It was officially part of Caversham Primary School until 1959, when it was declared a separate institution, and now has about 250 pupils. A third school, the <a href="Sara%20Cohen%20School">Sara Cohen School</a> in Rutherford Street, was established in 1926. This school caters for <a href="Special%20education">special needs pupils</a> from primary school age through adulthood. The school was named for the late wife of Mark Cohen, city councillor, campaigner for women's rights, and editor of the "<a href="Evening%20Star%20%28Dunedin%29">Evening Star</a>" newspaper from 1893 to 1920. In 1889, Mark Cohen was a major figure behind the founding of New Zealand's first kindergarten.

There are <a href="kindergarten">kindergarten</a>s and child-care centres in both Rutherford Street (by Kew Park) and South Road (to the east of the main retail area), and there are numerous pre-school facilities and further primary schools in the suburbs of <a href="Forbury%2C%20New%20Zealand">Forbury</a> and <a href="Saint%20Clair%2C%20New%20Zealand">Saint Clair</a>, immediately to the south of Caversham. The nearest secondary schools are the single-sex schools of <a href="Queen%27s%20High%20School%2C%20Dunedin">Queen's High School</a> and <a href="King%27s%20High%20School%2C%20Dunedin">King's High School</a>, located alongside each other close to the boundary between Saint Clair and <a href="South%20Dunedin">South Dunedin</a>, to the south.

In its early years, Caversham was heavily industrialised, but also contained a large number of residential properties. The population included a large number of skilled tradespeople and craftspeople, and both large and small industries abounded. Local industries at the beginning of the twentieth century included a brickworks, a gasworks, breweries, a smithy, milliners, several bakeries, a tannery, a bootmakers, and Rutherford's Wax Vesta match factory at Forbury Corner. In 1900, the South Road-David Street-Forbury Corner area was home to over 50 businesses.

Today, the suburb is mainly residential, though it has areas of retail and light industrial businesses. The main retail area is on South Road between the start of the rise up Caversham Valley and David Street, extending into David Street and the western end of Hillside Road (Forbury Corner, sometimes referred to as Kew Corner). A few shops are also located on South Road to the east, near <a href="Carisbrook">Carisbrook</a>. Hillside Road becomes increasingly light industrial as it approaches South Dunedin, with <a href="automotive%20engineering">automotive engineers</a>, car sales yards, <a href="joiner">joiner</a>ies, a rope factory, and a <a href="funeral%20parlour">funeral parlour</a>. One of Dunedin's largest industrial sites, the <a href="Hillside%20Railway%20Workshops">Hillside Railway Workshops</a>, dominates the eastern end of Hillside Road, close to which lie other, smaller, industrial sites. Beyond this is the shopping precinct of South Dunedin.

Caversham has four <a href="public%20house">public house</a>s – considerably fewer than in its formative years. These are the Carisbrook Hotel, close to the sports ground for which it is named, Mitchell's Tavern in the South Road retail area, the Waterloo Hotel at Forbury Corner, and the Fitzroy Hotel on Hillside Road near Bathgate Park.

<a href="Carisbrook">Carisbrook</a>, the city's former main <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> venue and a former <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a> ground, is at the eastern end of the suburb between The Glen and the Hillside Railway Workshops. It was the home of <a href="Otago%20Rugby%20Union">Otago Rugby Union</a> until a new stadium opened in <a href="North%20Dunedin">North Dunedin</a> (the <a href="Forsyth%20Barr%20Stadium%20at%20University%20Plaza">Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza</a>) in 2011. The new stadium is the new home of the Otago Rugby Union and <a href="Highlanders%20%28rugby%29">Highlanders</a> <a href="Super%20Rugby">Super Rugby</a> franchise, and met with some opposition within Dunedin, with objections focusing largely on the cost. The future of Carisbrook looks bleak, and many of the former facilities are in the process of being dismantled or removed.

Other than Carisbrook, the suburb's main sports ground is Bathgate Park, which lies at the border of Caversham and South Dunedin in the southeast. There are several open areas of recreation ground and parkland, notably Kew Park at Forbury Corner and Sidey Park and adjacent parkland along the northern flank of the by-pass, and there are tennis courts close to Kew Park on Thorn Street, and a croquet club between South Road and the Caversham by-pass. Kew Park is also home to one of the area's most prominent <a href="p%C3%A9tanque">pétanque</a> clubs.

Other sporting links with the suburb include <a href="Caversham%20%28soccer%29">Caversham Football Club</a>, one of Dunedin's most successful football teams. Caversham has reached the semi-finals of the national <a href="single-elimination%20tournament">knockout competition</a> (the <a href="Chatham%20Cup">Chatham Cup</a>) on three occasions, and was a member of the former <a href="New%20Zealand%20National%20Soccer%20League">New Zealand National Soccer League</a> for several seasons in the 1970s with a highest final position of fourth in 1975. They also played in the competition's final season (2003). Despite its name, Caversham play at Tonga Park, located in the adjacent suburb of <a href="Forbury%2C%20New%20Zealand">Forbury</a>, a ground they share with the Carisbrook-Dunedin Cricket Club. Caversham is also home to one of Dunedin's main athletics clubs.

The Southern Rugby Football Club, a rugby union club, is located at Bathgate Park to the southeast of Caversham. Southern is consistently among Dunedin's stronger club sides, and has been <a href="Otago%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Otago</a> club champion on over 20 occasions. It was formed from a merger of the Caversham and Pacific clubs in 1899. Southern's players have included over 20 <a href="All%20Blacks">All Blacks</a>, including <a href="Stephen%20Bachop">Stephen Bachop</a>, <a href="Stu%20Forster">Stu Forster</a>, <a href="Jamie%20Joseph">Jamie Joseph</a>, <a href="Laurie%20Mains">Laurie Mains</a>, and <a href="Gary%20Seear">Gary Seear</a>.

<a href="Hillside%20Railway%20Workshops">Hillside Railway Workshops</a> dominate the southeast of Caversham and the neighbouring suburb of South Dunedin. Established at this site in 1875, the workshops are the main railway construction and repair shop in the South Island. The workshops cover , of which are covered floor space.

To the north of the workshops is <a href="Carisbrook">Carisbrook</a>, Dunedin's former main sports venue. Opened in 1883, the ground had a capacity of 35,000 people, and was floodlit from the 1990s. Used primarily for rugby union, but also for other sports (notably as a Test cricket venue), Carisbrook lost its pre-eminence among the city's sports arenas with the construction of a new stadium in the northern end of the city in 2011; demolition began in 2013. The ground is named for the former home of early colonial settler <a href="James%20Macandrew">James Macandrew</a>, which in turn was named for <a href="Carisbrooke%20Castle">Carisbrooke Castle</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> in southern England.

Lisburn House is one of the finest surviving 1860s townhouses in New Zealand. Now run as a bed and breakfast establishment, this house was built in 1865 for the Fulton family, a pioneer farming family at their "Ravenscliffe" property on the <a href="Taieri%20Plains">Taieri Plains</a>. The house was named for the family's origins in <a href="Lisburn">Lisburn</a>, <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, and is Category I <a href="New%20Zealand%20Historic%20Places%20Trust">heritage listed</a>. <a href="William%20Clayton%20%28architect%29">William Clayton</a> designed the 12-room house, notable for its steeply angled slate roof and polychromatic brickwork. Two other Category II heritage buildings are on Fitzroy Street: Faringdon Villa, and an untitled house.

Other buildings of note in Caversham include the suburb's churches. The Presbyterian church is located on Thorn Street, roughly halfway between the South Road retail area and Forbury Corner. It was built in 1883 following the destruction of the previous building by fire. The current building, built in <a href="Port%20Chalmers">Port Chalmers</a> <a href="bluestone">bluestone</a> with <a href="Oamaru%20stone">Oamaru stone</a> facings, was designed by T. B. Cameron.
Caversham's Anglican church, St. Peter's, is located on Hillside Road. Designed by H. F. Hardy, the foundation stone was laid in 1882. The original design called for the church to have a spire, but because of problems with the tower's foundations (which left the tower leaning from the perpendicular) this was never constructed.

Caversham Baptist church is located at the corner of South Road and Surrey Street, close to Caversham School. Unusual among Dunedin buildings, this church has a formal Classical style, with its brickwork augmented by <a href="pediment">pediment</a>s and square columns. The foundation stone for the building was laid in 1906. The former Baptist Church, in Playfair Street, is now used as a Gospel Hall.

A further church, located in South Dunedin close to the southeastern edge of Caversham, was the South Dunedin Wesley Methodist Church in Hillside Road. This building, constructed in 1893, was threatened with demolition from 2009, and finally demolished in 2017. 

Part of the factory of Donaghy's Industries, adjacent to the eastern edge of Bathgate Park, is notable because of its unusual shape. This structure, which is less than wide yet some in length, serves as a <a href="ropewalk">ropewalk</a> for Donaghy's, who have been manufacturing rope and twine at this site since 1876.

A somewhat controversial recent addition to Caversham was the opening, in October 2013, of <a href="Whakamana%20Cannabis%20Museum">Whakamana Cannabis Museum</a>, New Zealand's first museum dedicated to the history of <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a> use. Cannabis, while still a criminalised drug in New Zealand, has moved some way towards grudging acceptance, at least as a subject for open discussion. The museum, run from a former residential house in David Street, is designed to be an information centre on aspects of the history and legislation surrounding the drug, and also a national centre for the <a href="Aotearoa%20Legalise%20Cannabis%20Party">Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party</a>, a minor single-issue political party.

Noted residents in the Caversham area have included members of the Sidey family, several of whom were local or national politicians. Among these was <a href="Thomas%20Sidey">Thomas Sidey</a>, New Zealand <a href="Attorney-General%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Attorney General</a> 1928–31. Sidey Park, close to the northern edge of the Caversham bypass, and Sidey Street in <a href="Corstorphine%2C%20New%20Zealand">Corstorphine</a> are both named in his honour.

Captain <a href="William%20Cargill">William Cargill</a>, founder of the Otago settlement, lived just to the northeast of Caversham above The Glen; his house "Hillside" gave its name to Hillside Road, which was at one time called Cargill Road. The area around the site of Cargill's long-demolished house between The Glen and <a href="Kensington%2C%20New%20Zealand">Kensington</a> is still referred to as Hillside. Cargill's Corner, the major road junction at the South Dunedin end of Hillside Road, is also named in his honour.

Architect <a href="Edmund%20Anscombe">Edmund Anscombe</a> was a Caversham resident. Anscombe was responsible for numerous important buildings in early 20th century New Zealand, many of which survive to the present day. Among them are the Sarjeant Art Gallery in <a href="Wanganui">Wanganui</a> and the <a href="Former%20Post%20and%20Telegraph%20Building%2C%20Wellington">Former Post and Telegraph Building</a> in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>. Noted local buildings with work by Anscombe include extensions to the <a href="University%20of%20Otago%20Clocktower%20complex">University of Otago Clocktower complex</a> in <a href="Dunedin%20North">Dunedin North</a>, the main building of <a href="Otago%20Girls%27%20High%20School">Otago Girls' High School</a> in central Dunedin, and the <a href="Allied%20Press">Allied Press</a> building in <a href="Stuart%20Street%2C%20Dunedin">Lower Stuart Street</a>, Dunedin.

Another notable local resident was surveyor and architect <a href="John%20Turnbull%20Thomson">John Turnbull Thomson</a>. Thomson was Chief Surveyor of the Otago Province from 1856 to 1873, and Surveyor-General of New Zealand from 1876 to 1879. During his time as provincial Chief Surveyor, Thomson explored and mapped large sections of the interior of the southern South Island. Many of the place names in this region reflect Thomson's <a href="Northumberland">Northumbrian</a> origins, with prosaic names in the form of a Northumbrian dialectic name for an animal. As a result, the area is still occasionally referred to as "<a href="Thomson%27s%20Barnyard">Thomson's Barnyard</a>" or "The Farmyard Patch".

Among sportspeople with Caversham connections, Australian Test cricketer and 1931 <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketer of the year</a> <a href="Clarrie%20Grimmett">Clarrie Grimmett</a> is perhaps the best known. Grimmett, the first player to take 200 <a href="test%20cricket">Test</a> wickets, was born in the suburb on Christmas Day, 1891. Noted rugby union administrators <a href="Vic%20Cavanagh%20%28born%201874%29">"Old Vic" Cavanagh</a> and <a href="Vic%20Cavanagh%20%28born%201909%29">"Young Vic" Cavanagh</a> were also born in Caversham. Between them, the father and son were responsible for changes to the way the game of rugby union was played through their innovative coaching methods and tactics.
The cricketer, poet, songwriter and teacher <a href="Robert%20J.%20Pope">Robert J. Pope</a> (1865–1949) was also born in Caversham.

The suburb's main road is South Road, which at its eastern (Glen) end winds around the flanks of hills before joining with <a href="Princes%20Street%2C%20Dunedin">Princes Street</a> and Dunedin's <a href="central%20business%20district">central business district</a>. A <a href="slip%20road">slip road</a> connects South Road with <a href="New%20Zealand%20State%20Highway%201">State Highway 1</a> at the foot of these hills, just above Carisbrook.

Hillside Road, which runs parallel with South Road several hundred metres to the south, is an arterial route connecting <a href="South%20Dunedin">South Dunedin</a> (at its eastern end) with Dunedin's southwestern suburbs. At its western end is Forbury Corner, a road junction linking Hillside Road with suburban arterial routes to the suburbs of <a href="Saint%20Clair%2C%20New%20Zealand">Saint Clair</a> (Forbury Road) and <a href="Corstorphine%2C%20New%20Zealand">Corstorphine</a> (Easther Crescent), as well as David Street, the major road link between Hillside Road and South Road. Numerous other small residential streets run parallel with David Street between Hillside Road and South Road. The suburb's other main roads include Caversham Valley Road, Playfair Street, Surrey Street, and Glen Road. The latter of these lies at the Glen at the eastern end of Caversham, providing a link between South Road and the hill suburbs of <a href="Maryhill%2C%20New%20Zealand">Maryhill</a>, <a href="Balaclava%2C%20New%20Zealand">Balaclava</a>, and <a href="Mornington%2C%20Otago">Mornington</a>.

A Caversham <a href="bypass%20%28road%29">bypass</a> was constructed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and was officially opened in 1987. It now carries State Highway 1 away from the retail heart of the suburb, connecting at its northern end with the city's one-way street system. With the construction of the bypass, Caversham Valley Road was truncated close to its junction with South Road, and the upper stretch of the road continued as part of State Highway 1, connecting the bypass with <a href="Dunedin%20Southern%20Motorway">Dunedin Southern Motorway</a>.

Until the construction of the bypass, South Road and Caversham Valley Road formed the main route out of Dunedin to the south. State Highway 1 followed South Road through the main retail area, then followed Caversham Valley Road to Lookout Point. Above its retail area, South Road winds around the flank of Calton Hill; Caversham Valley Road forms a straighter, steep route that originally continued from the end of South Road's retail area. For this reason, the part of South Road running through the retail area is also sometimes referred to as part of Caversham Valley Road. Improvements to Caversham Valley Road to ease congestion and increase safety began in 2011. A junction at the north end of Caversham's main retail area connects South Road with the bypass.

Caversham was served by a suburban railway station on the "South Line" between Dunedin and Mosgiel. Services ceased on this line in 1982. The railway station buildings were demolished several years later.

Trams served Caversham between 1880 and 1954, operating in Hillside Road, South Road, and David Street. Several bus routes now serve Caversham, connecting it with the heart of the city. <a href="Citibus%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Citibus</a> and <a href="Passenger%20Transport%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Dunedin Passenger Transport</a> run routes from the city centre to Saint Clair and Corstorphine via Hillside Road, and to Lookout Point via South Road. Dunedin passenger transport also runs services between <a href="The%20Octagon%2C%20Dunedin">The Octagon</a> and both <a href="Mosgiel">Mosgiel</a> and <a href="Brighton%2C%20New%20Zealand">Brighton</a> via South Road. Cargill's Corner, at the <a href="South%20Dunedin">South Dunedin</a> end of Hillside Road, is a major suburban bus hub.

History of the National Hockey League (1967–1992)

The expansion era of the National Hockey League (NHL) began when <a href="1967%20NHL%20expansion">six new teams</a> were added for the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20NHL%20season">1967–68 season</a>, ending the <a href="Original%20Six">Original Six</a> era. The six existing teams were grouped into the newly created <a href="East%20Division%20%28NHL%29">East Division</a>, and the expansion teams—the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a>, <a href="Minnesota%20North%20Stars">Minnesota North Stars</a>, <a href="California%20Golden%20Seals">Oakland Seals</a>, <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a>, <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> and <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a>—formed the <a href="West%20Division%20%28NHL%29">West Division</a>.

The NHL added another six teams by 1974 to bring the league to 18 teams. This continued expansion was partially brought about by the creation of the <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> (WHA), which operated from 1972 until 1979 and sought to compete with the NHL for markets and players. <a href="Bobby%20Hull">Bobby Hull</a> was the most famous player to defect to the rival league, signing a $2.75 million contract with the <a href="Winnipeg%20Jets%20%281972%E2%80%9396%29">Winnipeg Jets</a>. When the WHA ceased operations in 1979, the NHL absorbed four of the league's teams—the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>, <a href="Hartford%20Whalers">Hartford Whalers</a>, <a href="Quebec%20Nordiques">Quebec Nordiques</a> and Winnipeg Jets. This brought the NHL to 21 teams (the <a href="Cleveland%20Barons%20%28NHL%29">Cleveland Barons</a> had ceased operations in 1978), a figure that remained constant until the <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a> joined as an expansion franchise in 1991.

The NHL became involved in international play, starting with the <a href="Summit%20Series">Summit Series</a> in 1972, which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Canada won the eight-game series four wins to three with one tie. The success of the series led to the creation of the <a href="Canada%20Cup%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Canada Cup</a>, held five times between 1976 and 1991. NHL teams also faced <a href="Russian%20Super%20League">Soviet League</a> teams that toured North America between 1975 and 1991 in what was known as the <a href="Super%20Series">Super Series</a>. <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989">The fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989</a> saw many former Soviet-Bloc players stream into the NHL, joining several players who had defected in the 1980s.

This was the highest scoring period in NHL history. It was led in the 1980s by the Edmonton Oilers and <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a>, who scored 200 points or more four times, including a current league-record 215 in <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20NHL%20season">1985–86</a>. Gretzky's 92 goals in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20NHL%20season">1981–82</a> also remains a league record. No other player in NHL history has scored 200 points, although <a href="Mario%20Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a> came close in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20NHL%20season">1988–89</a> with 199.
Expansion had been a major topic of discussion among NHL owners since 1963, when <a href="William%20M.%20Jennings">William M. Jennings</a> of the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> proposed adding two new teams on the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> to counter fears that the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League%20%28minor%20pro%29">Western Hockey League</a> intended to compete as a major league. After several years of discussion, the NHL announced in February 1966 that it would expand by six teams, doubling the league's size. The <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a>, <a href="Minnesota%20North%20Stars">Minnesota North Stars</a>, <a href="California%20Golden%20Seals">California Seals</a>, <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a>, <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> and <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> began play in the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20NHL%20season">1967–68 season</a>. They formed the newly created <a href="West%20Division%20%28NHL%29">West Division</a>, and the existing teams were grouped into the <a href="East%20Division%20%28NHL%29">East Division</a>. The playoff format was constructed so that an established team would face an expansion team in the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> Finals. The <a href="Clarence%20S.%20Campbell%20Bowl">Clarence S. Campbell Bowl</a> was created in honour of league president <a href="Clarence%20Campbell">Clarence Campbell</a>, and was awarded to the West Division champion.

The new teams were stocked by the NHL's first <a href="1967%20NHL%20Expansion%20Draft">expansion draft</a>, as each team selected 20 players from the existing franchises. There was much debate over how many players each existing team could protect: the strongest clubs wished to protect more players, while the weaker clubs hoped that protecting fewer players would help improve the balance of competition. <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> manager <a href="Sam%20Pollock">Sam Pollock</a>'s suggestion to allow each team to protect eleven players to start, then add an additional player to their protected list for each player selected in the draft, was ultimately agreed to as a compromise solution. In addition, an "intra-league draft" was held following the 1968 and 1969 seasons to help accelerate the improvement of the expansion teams. Each team protected two goaltenders and fourteen skaters, leaving their remaining players open to be selected by any other team.

Some teams created instant <a href="farm%20system">farm system</a>s by buying existing minor league franchises. The Kings bought the <a href="Springfield%20Indians">Springfield Indians</a> of the <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> the night before the expansion draft, leading the Flyers to purchase the <a href="Quebec%20Aces">Quebec Aces</a>. Expansion also changed how the <a href="NHL%20Entry%20Draft">amateur draft</a> was handled. The old system, in which franchises sponsored junior teams and players, was abandoned by 1969 when all junior-aged players were made eligible for the entry draft.

In their inaugural season, the Flyers finished atop the West Division, recording 73 points in 74 games. The California Seals, a pre-season favourite to win the division, changed their name to the Oakland Seals a month into the season. The team disappointed both on the ice and at the gate, finishing last in the NHL with 14 wins. The Blues defeated the Flyers and North Stars to become the first expansion team to play for the Stanley Cup, where they were defeated in four consecutive games by the Canadiens. The Blues reached the finals again in both <a href="1969%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1969</a> and <a href="1970%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1970</a>, but were similarly swept in both years, losing to the Canadiens and <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>, respectively.

On January 13, 1968, North Stars' rookie <a href="Bill%20Masterton">Bill Masterton</a> became the first and, to date, only player to die as a result of injuries suffered during an NHL game. Early in a game against the Seals, Masterton was checked hard by two players, <a href="Ron%20Harris%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Ron Harris</a> and <a href="Larry%20Cahan">Larry Cahan</a>, causing him to flip over backwards and land on his head. He was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries, and died there two days later. The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league with the <a href="Bill%20Masterton%20Memorial%20Trophy">Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy</a> later in the season; the trophy is awarded annually to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. Following Masterton's death, players slowly began wearing helmets; starting in the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20NHL%20season">1979–80 season</a>, the league mandated that all players entering the league wear them.

In the <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20NHL%20season">1968–69 season</a>, second-year defenceman <a href="Bobby%20Orr">Bobby Orr</a> scored 21 goals, an NHL record for a defenceman, en route to winning his first of eight consecutive <a href="James%20Norris%20Memorial%20Trophy">Norris Trophies</a> as the league's top defenceman. At the same time, Orr's teammate, <a href="Phil%20Esposito">Phil Esposito</a>, became the first player in league history to score 100 points in a season, finishing with 126 points. He was one of three players to break the century mark that year, including <a href="Bobby%20Hull">Bobby Hull</a> and 41-year-old <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a>.

A gifted scorer, Orr revolutionized defencemen's impact on the offensive side of the game, as blue-liners began to be judged on how well they created goals in addition to how well they prevented them. Orr scored the Stanley-Cup-winning goal in overtime of the fourth game against the Blues in 1970, which gave the Bruins their first championship in 29 years. The goal was highlighted by his famous flight through the air after being tripped up following his shot. Orr twice won the <a href="Art%20Ross%20Trophy">Art Ross Trophy</a> as the NHL's leading scorer, still the only defenceman in NHL history to do so. His <a href="Plus-minus%20%28ice%20hockey%29">plus/minus</a> of +124 in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20NHL%20season">1970–71</a> is a league record. Orr signed a five-year contract that paid him $200,000 per season in 1971, the first $1 million contract in league history.

Chronic knee problems plagued Orr throughout his career. In 1972, he tore ligaments in his left knee after a hard hit, leading to the first of six knee operations. He played 12 seasons in the NHL before injuries forced his retirement in 1978. Orr finished with 270 goals and 915 points in 657 games and won the <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Memorial Trophy</a> as the league's <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a> three times. The customary three-year post-retirement waiting period for entry into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> was waived as he was enshrined in 1979.

In Canada, there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967. Three years later, the NHL added a third Canadian team when the <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a>, formerly of the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League%20%28minor%20pro%29">Western Hockey League</a>, were admitted as an expansion team for the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20NHL%20season">1970–71 season</a>, along with the <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a>, another team whose owners had bid unsuccessfully for an expansion team in 1967. The Canucks were placed in the East Division, despite being on the west coast, while the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Black Hawks</a> were shifted to the West in an attempt to equalize the divisions' strength. The league also gave the Sabres and Canucks the first two picks in each round of the <a href="1970%20NHL%20Amateur%20Draft">1970 NHL Amateur Draft</a>, offering them a better opportunity to build their rosters than the 1967 expansion teams had. Buffalo's first round pick was <a href="Gilbert%20Perreault">Gilbert Perreault</a>, a future Hall of Famer who would play seventeen seasons in Buffalo.

Before the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20NHL%20season">1971–72 season</a>, <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a> and <a href="Jean%20B%C3%A9liveau">Jean Beliveau</a> announced their retirements. Beliveau finished his 18-year career with 10 Stanley Cups, 2 Hart Trophies and 1,219 career points; his points total was the second-highest in NHL history. After playing 25 seasons in the NHL, Howe retired as the league's all-time leader in games played, goals, assists and points. Howe was a six-time league scoring champion, and also won six Hart Trophies. Both players had the customary three-year waiting period waived for entry into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in acknowledgement of their achievements.

In 1972, the NHL faced competition from the newly formed <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> (WHA). The WHA lured many players away from the NHL, including <a href="Derek%20Sanderson">Derek Sanderson</a>, <a href="J.%20C.%20Tremblay">J. C. Tremblay</a> and <a href="Ted%20Green">Ted Green</a>. The WHA's biggest coup was to lure <a href="Bobby%20Hull">Bobby Hull</a> from the Black Hawks to play for the <a href="Winnipeg%20Jets%20%281972%E2%80%9396%29">Winnipeg Jets</a>. Hull signed a 10-year deal: five years as a player for $250,000 per season, and five more for $100,000 per season in a front-office position. It also included a $1 million signing bonus. The deal totaled $2.7 million, and lent instant credibility to the new league. After Hull signed, several other players quickly followed suit. <a href="Bernie%20Parent">Bernie Parent</a>, <a href="Gerry%20Cheevers">Gerry Cheevers</a>, <a href="John%20McKenzie%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Johnny McKenzie</a> and <a href="Rick%20Ley">Rick Ley</a> jumped to the WHA as the NHL suddenly found itself in a war for talent. By the time the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20WHA%20season">1972–73 WHA season</a> began, 67 players had switched from the NHL to the WHA. Defections continued following the season, and the WHA scored another major coup when it signed Gordie Howe's sons <a href="Mark%20Howe">Mark</a> and <a href="Marty%20Howe">Marty</a>. The league then convinced Gordie to come out of retirement to play with them on the <a href="Houston%20Aeros%20%28WHA%29">Houston Aeros</a>.

The NHL tried to block several of the defections. The Bruins attempted to restrain Cheevers and Sanderson from joining the WHA, though a United States federal court refused to prohibit the signings. The Black Hawks were successful in having a restraining order filed against Hull and the Jets pending the outcome of legal action the Black Hawks were taking against the WHA. The WHA was eager for the court action, intending to challenge the legality of the reserve clause, which bound a player to their NHL team until that team released him. In November 1972, a Philadelphia district court placed an injunction against the NHL, preventing it from enforcing the reserve clause and freeing all players who had restraining orders against them, including Hull, to play with their WHA clubs. The decision effectively ended the NHL's monopoly on major league professional hockey talent.

The NHL also found itself competing with the WHA for markets. Initially, the league had no intention to expand past 14 teams, but the threat the WHA posed changed this. Hoping to keep the WHA out of the newly completed <a href="Nassau%20Veterans%20Memorial%20Coliseum">Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum</a> in <a href="Uniondale%2C%20New%20York">Uniondale, New York</a> and the <a href="Omni%20Coliseum">Omni Coliseum</a> in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta, Georgia</a>, the league hastily announced the creation of the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a> and <a href="Atlanta%20Flames">Atlanta Flames</a> as <a href="1972%20NHL%20Expansion%20Draft">1972 expansion teams</a>. Following the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20NHL%20season">1972–73 season</a>, the NHL announced it was further expanding to 18 teams for the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20NHL%20season">1974–75 season</a>, adding the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Scouts">Kansas City Scouts</a> and <a href="Washington%20Capitals">Washington Capitals</a>. In just eight years, the NHL had tripled in size to 18 teams.

Internationally, Canada had long been protesting the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s use of "professional amateurs" at the <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20World%20Championships">World Championships</a> and the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%20Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>, which were amateur events. Canada withdrew from international competition in 1969 and boycotted the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%201972%20Winter%20Olympics">1972 Olympic hockey tournament</a>. As an alternative, <a href="NHL%20Players%27%20Association">NHL Players' Association</a> executive director <a href="Alan%20Eagleson">Alan Eagleson</a> negotiated a deal with Soviet authorities to hold an eight-game series between the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Soviet national team</a> and Canada's top professionals.

The tournament was the NHL's response to the defection of players to the WHA. Bobby Hull was barred from playing, as was any other player who signed a contract with the rival league, which was a heavily criticized move. <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Pierre%20Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a> sent a telegram to NHL president <a href="Clarence%20Campbell">Clarence Campbell</a>, expressing his "intense interest which I share with millions of Canadians ... that Canada should be represented by its best hockey players, including Bobby Hull". Echoing the feelings of the public, Hull called the decision "crazy", and stated that "I'm a Canadian and I want to play for my country. I don't know why the NHL has to be so petty over this. I want to do this for Canada." The NHL did not relent.

The series was tied at three wins apiece and a tie entering the eighth and deciding game, with millions of Canadians watching "the game of the century". With the game tied at five late in the third, the Soviets were met with a concerted Canadian attack in the final seven minutes. With 34 seconds remaining in the game, Esposito took a shot at <a href="Vladislav%20Tretiak">Vladislav Tretiak</a> from 12 feet out. <a href="Paul%20Henderson">Paul Henderson</a> scooped up the rebound and put it past the fallen Soviet goalie to score the goal that won the game, 6–5, and the series. Later, <a href="Alexander%20Nikolaevich%20Yakovlev">Alexander Yakolev</a>, the former Soviet ambassador to Canada, argued that the Summit Series planted the seeds of <a href="glasnost">glasnost</a> and <a href="perestroika">perestroika</a> in the Soviet Union, as it was one of the first times that the Soviet people had seen so many foreigners who had not come to do harm, but to share in the game.

The series forced the NHL and the <a href="Canadian%20Amateur%20Hockey%20Association">Canadian Amateur Hockey Association</a> to reassess all aspects of how the game was played in North America. Journalist Herb Pinder described the NHL to that point in this way: "The Europeans took our game and evolved it, while we stood still or even went backwards. The Russians had a style, and the Czechs' style was different from that ... There was this hockey world evolving through international competition, and we're back here, "stuck", just playing ourselves. It was a business monopoly. And like any monopoly, the NHL got stagnant." Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Canadian hockey encouraged the adoption of new coaching and training methods used in Europe, and emphasized conditioning and skills development.

The NHL took a greater interest in international play. The <a href="Canada%20Cup%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Canada Cup</a>, a tournament that featured the top professional players in the world, was held first in 1976, and then four more times until 1991. It was succeeded by the <a href="World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">World Cup of Hockey</a> in 1996. Beginning in 1975, Soviet club teams began touring North America, playing NHL clubs in exhibition games that were known as the <a href="Super%20Series">Super Series</a>. The <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a> and <a href="Washington%20Capitals">Washington Capitals</a> similarly toured the Soviet Union in 1989 in the first "Friendship Series". The Soviet national team defeated an NHL all-star team in a 1979 challenge series, two games to one, and split <a href="Rendez-vous%20%2787">Rendez-vous '87</a>, a two-game series held in <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec City</a>.

The 1970s were associated with aggressive, and often violent, play. Known as the "", the Philadelphia Flyers are the most famous example of this style. The Flyers established league records for penalty minutes—<a href="Dave%20Schultz%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Dave "the Hammer" Schultz</a>'s total of 472 in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20NHL%20season">1974–75</a> remains a league record—and ended up in courtrooms multiple times when players went into the stands to challenge fans who got involved. One such incident occurred in Vancouver in December 1972, when a fan reached over the glass to pull the hair of <a href="Don%20Saleski">Don Saleski</a>, who had a chokehold on Vancouver's <a href="Barry%20Wilkins">Barry Wilkins</a>. <a href="Bobby%20Taylor%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Bobby Taylor</a> and several Flyers teammates followed the fan into the stands. The next time Philadelphia went to Vancouver, several players were brought before the courts on charges that ranged from use of obscene language to common assault. Six players were fined, and Taylor received a 30-day <a href="suspended%20sentence">suspended sentence</a>. Despite these incidents, the Flyers won: they captured the <a href="1974%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1974 Stanley Cup</a>, becoming the first expansion team to win the league championship, and repeated as champions in 1975.

In 1975, Soviet club teams began to tour North America in the first Super Series. The Canadiens played <a href="HC%20CSKA%20Moscow">Central Red Army</a> to a 3–3 draw on New Year's Eve 1975, in a game that is considered one of the finest ever played. Red Army lost only one of four games against the NHL in the first tour, a 4–1 defeat to Philadelphia, who intimidated them as the Flyers did to their NHL opponents. At one point, Red Army threatened to forfeit the game after <a href="Ed%20Van%20Impe">Ed Van Impe</a> decked <a href="Valeri%20Kharlamov">Valeri Kharlamov</a>. Red Army was persuaded to complete the game after Alan Eagleson threatened to withhold their appearance fee if the team did not return to the ice. Super Series games continued until 1991, when Soviet players were allowed to enter the NHL after the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985%E2%80%931991%29%23Dissolution%20of%20the%20USSR">collapse of the Soviet Union</a>.

On February 7, 1976, Maple Leafs star <a href="Darryl%20Sittler">Darryl Sittler</a> set an NHL record, scoring 10 points in one game in an 11–4 victory over the Bruins. His six-goal, four-assist effort broke <a href="Maurice%20Richard">Maurice Richard</a>'s record of eight points in a game. The game came shortly after the Bruins lured Gerry Cheevers back from the WHA, though Cheevers was given an extra night to rest, and rookie <a href="Dave%20Reece">Dave Reece</a> was the victim of all 11 Toronto goals. It was his 14th, and final, NHL game.

By 1976, both leagues were dealing with serious financial problems. Talks of a merger between the NHL and the WHA were growing. Bobby Hull declared that a merger was "inevitable", though WHA president <a href="Bill%20MacFarland">Bill MacFarland</a> stated that his league had no interest in joining with the NHL. In 1976, for the first time in four decades, the NHL approved franchise relocations; the Scouts moved after just two years in Kansas City to <a href="Denver%2C%20Colorado">Denver</a> to become the <a href="Colorado%20Rockies%20%28NHL%29">Colorado Rockies</a>, while the California Golden Seals became the <a href="Cleveland%20Barons%20%28NHL%29">Cleveland Barons</a>. In its wake, the league quietly shelved provisional expansion franchises granted to <a href="Seattle%20Totems">Seattle</a> and <a href="Denver%20Spurs">Denver</a> to take place in the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20NHL%20season">1977 season</a>. Two years later, after failed overtures towards merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver, they merged with the Minnesota North Stars, reducing the NHL to 17 teams for <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20NHL%20season">1978–79</a>.

The WHA's last triumph was to lure junior prodigy <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> to their league in <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20WHA%20season">1978–79</a>. <a href="Nelson%20Skalbania">Nelson Skalbania</a>, owner of the <a href="Indianapolis%20Racers">Indianapolis Racers</a> and part owner of the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>, was convinced to sign Gretzky to play for the Racers. The 17-year-old Gretzky scored 110 points in his first professional season, split between the Racers and the Oilers.

The move towards a merger picked up in 1977 when <a href="John%20Ziegler%20%28ice%20hockey%29">John Ziegler</a> succeeded Campbell as NHL president. After several years of negotiations, WHA owners thought they had an agreement in March 1979. The motion to merge failed when supporters in the NHL lost by one vote. Word got out that the Montreal Canadiens, owned by <a href="Molson">Molson Brewery</a>, and the Vancouver Canucks, who served Molson products at their games, had voted against the merger. Fans across Canada quickly organized a boycott of Molson products, while the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons</a> unanimously passed a motion urging the NHL to reconsider. Another vote was held, and both Montreal and Vancouver switched their votes, allowing the motion to pass. The WHA folded following the 1978–79 season, and the Edmonton Oilers, <a href="Hartford%20Whalers">New England Whalers</a>, <a href="Quebec%20Nordiques">Quebec Nordiques</a> and <a href="Winnipeg%20Jets%20%281972%E2%80%9396%29">Winnipeg Jets</a> joined the NHL as expansion teams.

The merger brought Gordie Howe back to the NHL for one final season in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20NHL%20season">1979–80</a>. At age 51, Howe played all 80 games for the Whalers, scoring 15 goals to bring his NHL career total to 801. He entered his second retirement as the league's all-time scoring leader with 1,850 points. Howe's final season was also the last for the Atlanta Flames. The team averaged an attendance of only 9,800 fans per game and lost over $2 million in <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20NHL%20season">1979–80</a>. They were sold for a record $16 million, and relocated north to become the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a> in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20NHL%20season">1980–81</a>. Two years later, the Rockies were sold for $30 million, and left Denver to become the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Devils">New Jersey Devils</a> for the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20NHL%20season">1982–83 season</a>.

The <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> nearly relocated to <a href="Saskatoon">Saskatoon</a> in 1983, as <a href="Bill%20Hunter%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Bill Hunter</a>, an original investor in the WHA, announced an intention to purchase and relocate the team. Hunter quickly convinced 18,000 people to commit to season tickets in a proposed arena for the city. The other team owners rejected the sale and relocation by a 15–3 vote, prompting the Blues' owner, <a href="Nestl%C3%A9%20Purina%20PetCare">Ralston Purina</a>, to file a $60 million anti-trust lawsuit against the league. Both the league as a whole and the individual teams filed $78 million counter suits against Purina. As part of the conflict, Purina turned the team over to the NHL at the beginning of June 1983 to "operate, sell or dispose of in whatever manner the league desires", while the Blues refused to participate in the <a href="1983%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1983 NHL Entry Draft</a>, forfeiting all of their draft picks. By the end of July, the league had sold the team to <a href="Harry%20Ornest">Harry Ornest</a>, who vowed the team would remain in St. Louis. Ralston Purina and the NHL settled their legal issues in 1985, though terms of the settlements were not released.

In <a href="1980%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1980</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a> won their first of four consecutive Stanley Cups. With the likes of <a href="Billy%20Smith%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Billy Smith</a>, <a href="Mike%20Bossy">Mike Bossy</a>, <a href="Denis%20Potvin">Denis Potvin</a>, and <a href="Bryan%20Trottier">Bryan Trottier</a>, the Islanders dominated both the regular season and the playoffs. In 1981, Bossy became the first player to score <a href="50%20goals%20in%2050%20games">50 goals in 50 games</a> since <a href="Maurice%20Richard">Maurice Richard</a> in 1945. In <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20NHL%20season">1982–83</a>, the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> won the regular season championship. The Islanders and Oilers met in the Finals and New York swept Edmonton for their last Stanley Cup. They were the second franchise to win four straight championships, after the Canadiens. The 1984 playoffs would be the site of the infamous <a href="Good%20Friday%20Massacre">Good Friday Massacre</a> between the Quebec Nordiques and the Montreal Canadiens.

The following season, the Oilers and Islanders met again in the playoffs. The Oilers won the rematch in five games, marking the start of another dynasty. Led by <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> and <a href="Mark%20Messier">Mark Messier</a>, the Oilers won five Stanley Cup championships between 1984 and 1990. The Oilers won two consecutive Cups in the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, and in the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons. They also won a Cup in the 1989–90 season. The Oilers' Cup streaks were interrupted in the 1985–86 and 1988–89 seasons by two other Canadian teams. Edmonton's hopes for a third consecutive title in 1986 were dashed by their <a href="Battle%20of%20Alberta%23Oilers%20vs.%20Flames">provincial rival</a>, the Calgary Flames, after Oilers' rookie <a href="James%20Stephen%20Smith">Steve Smith</a> accidentally bounced the series-winning goal off goaltender <a href="Grant%20Fuhr">Grant Fuhr</a> and into his own net. Smith's error remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history. The Flames were defeated by the Canadiens in the finals, as rookie goaltender <a href="Patrick%20Roy">Patrick Roy</a> led Montreal to their 23rd Stanley Cup. The 1989 final was a rematch between the Flames and the Canadiens and was won by Calgary, which captured its only championship in franchise history. The Flames also became the only team to defeat the Montreal Canadiens for the Stanley Cup at the <a href="Montreal%20Forum">Montreal Forum</a>.

The 21-team era ended in 1990, when the league revealed ambitious plans to double league revenues from $400 million within a decade and bring the NHL to 28 franchises during that period. The NHL quickly announced three new teams: the <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a>, who began play in the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20NHL%20season">1991–92 season</a>, and the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a> and <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a>, who followed a year later.

The Sharks' creation forestalled a unilateral franchise move by North Stars owners George and <a href="Gordon%20Gund">Gordon Gund</a> to the San Francisco Bay Area. A settlement with the league granted them the expansion franchise, while they sold the North Stars to <a href="Howard%20Baldwin">Howard Baldwin</a>'s group in 1990. Prior to the 1991-92 season, the Sharks and North Stars participated in <a href="1991%20NHL%20Dispersal%20and%20Expansion%20Drafts">a unique expansion draft</a>, which saw San Jose select unprotected players from Minnesota (including future All-Star goalie <a href="Arturs%20Irbe">Arturs Irbe</a>) before both teams picked players from the remainder of the league. The Sharks would struggle in their inaugural season, finishing with a league-low 17 wins and 39 points while playing out of the <a href="Cow%20Palace">Cow Palace</a>, while the North Stars (who were sold again, to <a href="Norman%20Green">Norman Green</a>, during the 1990-91 season) would make the playoffs for what proved to be the final time before their eventual <a href="Dallas%20Stars">relocation to Dallas</a> in 1993.

In the latter part of the 1980s, the Oilers won five Stanley Cup titles in seven years, becoming the only team to score 400 or more goals in a season, which they did four times. With future Hall of Famers Grant Fuhr, <a href="Paul%20Coffey">Paul Coffey</a>, <a href="Jari%20Kurri">Jari Kurri</a>, Mark Messier, and <a href="Glenn%20Anderson">Glenn Anderson</a>, they established numerous new scoring records.

The Oilers were led by Wayne Gretzky, who remained with the Oilers when they joined the NHL in 1979. At and , some observers doubted that Gretzky could match his offensive performance from his lone WHA season. "I heard a lot of talk then that I'd never get 110 points like I did in the WHA," said Gretzky. He proved his critics wrong, scoring 137 points in 1979–80 and winning the first of nine <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Trophies</a> (including 8 consecutive awards from 1980–1988) as the NHL's most valuable player. Over the next several seasons, Gretzky established new highs in goals scored in a season, with 92 in the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20NHL%20season">1981–82 season</a>; in assists, with 163 in the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20NHL%20season">1985–86</a>; and in total points, with 215 in 1985–86. He also scored 50 goals in 39 games, the fastest any player had reached the total in a single season. Gretzky scored his 1,000th NHL point in his 424th game, breaking <a href="Guy%20Lafleur">Guy Lafleur</a>'s old record of 720 games.

Gretzky's teammates set records of their own. Fuhr's 14 assists in the 1983–84 season set a record for most points by a goaltender in a season. In 1985–86, Coffey set a record for the most goals in a season by a defenceman, with 48. Adding 90 assists, Coffey wound up a point short of tying <a href="Bobby%20Orr">Bobby Orr</a>'s record for most points in a season by a blue-liner.

On August 9, 1988, Oilers owner <a href="Peter%20Pocklington">Peter Pocklington</a>, in financial trouble, traded Gretzky, along with <a href="Marty%20McSorley">Marty McSorley</a> and <a href="Mike%20Krushelnyski">Mike Krushelnyski</a>, to the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a> in exchange for <a href="Jimmy%20Carson">Jimmy Carson</a>, <a href="Martin%20G%C3%A9linas">Martin Gelinas</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Dollar">US$</a>15 million and three first-round draft picks. Gretzky left Edmonton with a tear-filled news conference, and later said that Edmonton was the only place he ever dreaded playing. Gretzky's trade to the Kings popularized ice hockey in the United States, making hockey "cool" in <a href="Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Hollywood</a>, and shocked fans across Canada. The Kings were the most popular Los Angeles sports team, and Gretzky's fame rivaled that of his peers with baseball's <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> and basketball's <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a>.

With the Kings, Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's record for career points. On October 15, 1989, against his former Oilers' teammates, and with Howe in attendance, Gretzky tied the record with a first period assist before notching his 1,851st career point with a third period goal. "An award such as this takes a lot of teamwork and help and both teams here today definitely have a part of the 1,851 [points]." said Gretzky.

While European-born players were a part of the NHL since its founding, it was still rare to see them in the league until 1980. The WHA turned to the previously overlooked European market in search for talent, signing players from <a href="Finland">Finland</a> and <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>. <a href="Anders%20Hedberg">Anders Hedberg</a>, <a href="Lars-Erik%20Sj%C3%B6berg">Lars-Erik Sjoberg</a> and <a href="Ulf%20Nilsson%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Ulf Nilsson</a> signed with the Jets in 1974 and thrived in North America, both in the WHA and later the NHL. The Jets won three of the six remaining WHA championships after signing European players, and their success sparked similar signings league-wide.

<a href="B%C3%B6rje%20Salming">Borje Salming</a> was the first European star in the NHL. He signed with the Maple Leafs in 1973, and played 16 seasons in the NHL, retiring in 1990. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1996. His fellow Swede, <a href="Pelle%20Lindbergh">Pelle Lindbergh</a>, was one of the top goaltenders in the world in the early 1980s. He led the Flyers to the <a href="1985%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1985 Stanley Cup Finals</a> before dying in a car accident during the 1985–86 season. Finns <a href="Jari%20Kurri">Jari Kurri</a> and <a href="Esa%20Tikkanen">Esa Tikkanen</a> helped lead the Oilers dynasty of the 1980s.

While the WHA opened the door, and players slowly joined the NHL, those behind the <a href="Iron%20Curtain">Iron Curtain</a> were restricted from following suit. In 1980, <a href="Peter%20%C5%A0%C5%A5astn%C3%BD">Peter Stastny</a>, his wife, and his brother <a href="Anton%20%C5%A0%C5%A5astn%C3%BD">Anton</a> secretly fled <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> with the aid of Nordiques owner <a href="Marcel%20Aubut">Marcel Aubut</a>. The Stastnys' defection made international headlines, and contributed to the first wave of Eastern Europeans' entrance into the NHL. Hoping that they would one day be permitted to play in the NHL, teams drafted Soviet players in the 1980s, 27 in all by the 1988 draft. However, defection was the only way such players could join the teams that drafted them. <a href="Michal%20Pivo%C5%88ka">Michal Pivonka</a> defected from Czechoslovakia in 1986, while Russian <a href="Alexander%20Mogilny">Alexander Mogilny</a> defected following the <a href="1989%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a> in <a href="Anchorage%2C%20Alaska">Anchorage, Alaska</a>. Czech teenager <a href="Petr%20Nedv%C4%9Bd">Petr Nedved</a> walked into a <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a> police station in January 1989 after playing in the <a href="Mac%27s%20AAA%20midget%20hockey%20tournament">Mac's AAA midget hockey tournament</a>.

Shortly before the end of the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20NHL%20season">1988–89 regular season</a>, Flames general manager <a href="Cliff%20Fletcher">Cliff Fletcher</a> announced that he had reached an agreement with Soviet authorities that allowed <a href="Sergei%20Pryakhin">Sergei Pryakhin</a> to play in North America. It was the first time a member of the Soviet national team was permitted to play for a non-Soviet team. Shortly after, Soviet players began to flood into the NHL. Teams anticipated that there would be an influx of Soviet players in the 1990s, as 18 Soviets were selected in the <a href="1989%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1989 NHL Entry Draft</a>. The entire "KLM" line, the Soviet team's top line, joined the NHL in 1989 as <a href="Vladimir%20Krutov">Vladimir Krutov</a> and <a href="Igor%20Larionov">Igor Larionov</a> played for the Canucks, while <a href="Sergei%20Makarov%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Sergei Makarov</a> went to Calgary. Makarov won the <a href="Calder%20Memorial%20Trophy">Calder Memorial Trophy</a> as rookie of the year in 1990, a selection that caused controversy; he was 32 years old and had played 11 pro seasons in the Soviet League. In the wake of the controversy, the NHL amended its rules: players over the age of 26 were no longer considered for the award. The fall of the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a> in 1989 and the demise of the Iron Curtain paved the way for more Eastern European players to play in North America. Only six European players were selected at the <a href="1979%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1979 NHL Entry Draft</a>. That number increased to 32 in <a href="1989%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1989</a>, while a record 123 Europeans were drafted in <a href="2000%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2000</a>. Europeans made up 22.5% of the NHL in 2013-14, totalling 232 players.

The early 1980s saw many tie games. The <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20NHL%20season">1982–83</a> North Stars and Capitals both finished with 16 ties in 80 games, while 17 of 21 teams tied 10 or more games. The season before, the North Stars recorded 20 ties. As a result of the frequent ties, the NHL reintroduced <a href="Overtime%20%28ice%20hockey%29">overtime</a> for the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20NHL%20season">1983–84 season</a>. The effect was immediate, as only seven teams had ten or more ties. Before its discontinuation during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the NHL played a full 10-minute overtime period. The modern overtime format was set as a five-minute, sudden death period; the game ended when either team scored.

The NHL changed its divisional alignment and playoff formats numerous times as it grew. The league's doubling in 1967 also led to the expansion of the playoffs to eight teams from four the previous year. Expansion to 18 teams in 1974 caused the league to realign into two conferences and four divisions, each named after important figures in league history. The teams were split into the <a href="Campbell%20Conference">Campbell Conference</a>, consisting of the <a href="Patrick%20Division">Patrick</a> and <a href="Smythe%20Division">Smythe</a> divisions, and the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%20Conference">Prince of Wales Conference</a>, consisting of the <a href="Adams%20Division">Adams</a> and <a href="Norris%20Division">Norris</a> divisions. The playoffs were expanded to 12 teams, and each division winner was granted a bye in the first round of the playoffs. The addition of the four WHA teams in 1979 saw the playoffs expanded to 16 teams.

In 1981, the league realigned all teams by geography. Eastern teams played in the Adams and Patrick divisions of the Wales Conference, and Western teams played in the Norris and Smythe divisions of the Campbell Conference. In addition, the playoff format was changed to have the top four teams in each division qualify rather than the top 16 teams overall. The first two playoff rounds were played entirely within each division. This format lasted until 1993.

During the late 1960s, the concept of sponsoring junior players and teams had been dismantled, meaning that for the <a href="1969%20NHL%20Amateur%20Draft">1969 NHL Amateur Draft</a>, every player aged 20 or above was eligible to be selected. The Montreal Canadiens, however, exercised a special "cultural option" that allowed them to select two players of French-Canadian heritage, before any other players were selected. These players counted as Montreal's first two choices. After the Canadiens took <a href="R%C3%A9jean%20Houle">Rejean Houle</a> and <a href="Marc%20Tardif">Marc Tardif</a>, the rest of the league voted to end the rule in 1970, just before future star <a href="Gilbert%20Perreault">Gilbert Perreault</a> was selected first in the <a href="1970%20NHL%20Expansion%20Draft">1970 expansion draft</a> by the <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a>.

In 1974, Sabres general manager <a href="Punch%20Imlach">Punch Imlach</a> decided to play a joke on the league during the draft. He selected <a href="Taro%20Tsujimoto">Taro Tsujimoto</a> of the "Tokyo Katanas" with his 11th round pick. Other teams were shocked that the Sabres had scouted for players in Japan, and the league made the pick official. Weeks later, Imlach admitted that he made the player up, choosing the name out of a phone book.

The league reformatted the Amateur Draft into the NHL Entry Draft in 1979 and simultaneously lowered the draft age to 19. It was first opened to the public in 1980, when 2,500 fans attended the draft in the <a href="Montreal%20Forum">Montreal Forum</a>. The public draft has grown such that it is now held annually in NHL arenas and televised internationally.

Raccoon

The raccoon ( or , "Procyon lotor"), sometimes spelled racoon, also known as the common raccoon, North American raccoon, northern raccoon, or coon, is a medium-sized <a href="mammal">mammal</a> native to North America. The raccoon is the largest of the <a href="procyonid">procyonid</a> family, having a body length of and a body weight of . Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense <a href="underfur">underfur</a> which insulates it against cold weather. Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front <a href="paw">paw</a>s, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the <a href="mythologies%20of%20the%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas</a>. Raccoons are noted for their <a href="animal%20cognition">intelligence</a>, with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years. They are usually <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> and <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a>, eating about 40% <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, 33% <a href="plant">plant</a>s, and 27% <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s.

The original <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s of the raccoon are <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> and <a href="temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forests">mixed forests</a>, but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas, <a href="coastal%20marsh">coastal marsh</a>es, and <a href="urban%20area">urban area</a>s, where some homeowners consider them to be <a href="Pest%20%28organism%29">pests</a>. As a result of escapes and deliberate <a href="introduced%20species">introductions</a> in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across much of mainland Europe, <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>.

Though previously thought to be generally solitary, there is now evidence that raccoons engage in gender-specific <a href="social%20behavior">social behavior</a>. Related females often share a common area, while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four animals to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season, and other potential invaders. <a href="Home%20range">Home range</a> sizes vary anywhere from for females in cities to for males in <a href="prairie">prairie</a>s. After a <a href="gestation">gestation</a> period of about 65 days, two to five young, known as "kits", are born in spring. The kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersal in late fall. Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years, their life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years. In many areas, <a href="hunting">hunting</a> and vehicular injury are the two most common causes of death.

The word "raccoon" was adopted into English from the native <a href="Powhatan%20language">Powhatan</a> term, as used in the <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Colony of Virginia</a>. It was recorded on <a href="John%20Smith%20%28explorer%29">John Smith</a>'s list of Powhatan words as "aroughcun", and on that of <a href="William%20Strachey">William Strachey</a> as "arathkone". It has also been identified as a reflex of a <a href="Proto-Algonquian%20language">Proto-Algonquian</a> root "*ahrah-koon-em", meaning "[the] one who rubs, scrubs and scratches with its hands".

Similarly, <a href="Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Spanish colonists</a> adopted the Spanish word from the <a href="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> of the <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a>s, meaning "[the] one who takes everything in its hands". In many languages, the raccoon is named for its characteristic dousing behavior in conjunction with that language's term for "bear", for example (‘wash-bear’) in German, "Huan Xiong" (浣熊 ‘wash-bear’) in Chinese, (‘little-bear washing’) in Italian, and "araiguma" ( ’washing-bear’) in Japanese. Alternatively, only the washing behavior might be referred to, as in Russian "poloskun" (, ‘rinser’).

The <a href="colloquialism">colloquial</a> abbreviation "coon" is used in words like "coonskin" for <a href="fur%20clothing">fur clothing</a> and in phrases like "old coon" as a self-designation of <a href="trapping">trappers</a>. In the 1830s, the United States <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> used the raccoon as an emblem, causing them to be pejoratively known as "coons" by their political opponents, who saw them as too sympathetic to African-Americans. Soon after that the term became an <a href="ethnic%20slur">ethnic slur</a>, especially in use between 1880 and 1920 (see "<a href="coon%20song">coon song</a>"), and the term is still considered offensive.

In the first decades after its discovery by the members of the expedition of <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>, who was the first person to leave a written record about the species, <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomists</a> thought the raccoon was related to many different species, including <a href="Canidae">dogs</a>, <a href="Felidae">cats</a>, <a href="badger">badger</a>s and particularly <a href="bear">bear</a>s. <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, the father of modern taxonomy, placed the raccoon in the genus "<a href="Ursus%20%28genus%29">Ursus</a>", first as "Ursus cauda elongata" ("long-tailed bear") in the second edition of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" (1740), then as "Ursus Lotor" ("washer bear") in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">tenth edition (1758–59)</a>. In 1780, <a href="Gottlieb%20Conrad%20Christian%20Storr">Gottlieb Conrad Christian Storr</a> placed the raccoon in its own genus "<a href="Procyon%20%28genus%29">Procyon</a>", which can be translated as either "before the dog" or "doglike". It is also possible that Storr had its <a href="nocturnality">nocturnal</a> lifestyle in mind and chose the star <a href="Procyon">Procyon</a> as eponym for the species.

Based on <a href="fossil">fossil</a> evidence from Russia and Bulgaria, the first known members of the family <a href="Procyonidae">Procyonidae</a> lived in Europe in the late <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> about 25 million years ago. Similar tooth and skull structures suggest procyonids and <a href="Mustelidae">weasels</a> share a common ancestor, but molecular analysis indicates a closer relationship between raccoons and bears. After the then-existing species crossed the <a href="Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</a> at least six million years later in the early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>, the center of its distribution was probably in Central America. <a href="Coati">Coati</a>s ("Nasua" and "Nasuella") and raccoons ("Procyon") have been considered to share common descent from a species in the genus "Paranasua" present between 5.2 and 6.0 million years ago. This assumption, based on morphological comparisons of fossils, conflicts with a 2006 genetic analysis which indicates raccoons are more closely related to <a href="Bassariscus">ringtails</a>. Unlike other procyonids, such as the <a href="crab-eating%20raccoon">crab-eating raccoon</a> ("Procyon cancrivorus"), the ancestors of the common raccoon left <a href="tropics">tropical</a> and <a href="subtropics">subtropical</a> areas and migrated farther north about 2.5 million years ago, in a migration that has been confirmed by the discovery of fossils in the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> dating back to the middle of the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>. Its most recent ancestor was likely "Procyon rexroadensis", a large <a href="Blancan">Blancan</a> raccoon from the <a href="Rexroad%20Formation">Rexroad Formation</a> characterized by its narrow back teeth and large lower jaw.

As of 2005, "<a href="Mammal%20Species%20of%20the%20World">Mammal Species of the World</a>" recognizes 22 subspecies of raccoons. Four of these subspecies <a href="Endemism">living only</a> on small Central American and <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> islands were often regarded as distinct species after their discovery. These are the <a href="Bahamian%20raccoon">Bahamian raccoon</a> and <a href="Guadeloupe%20raccoon">Guadeloupe raccoon</a>, which are very similar to each other; the <a href="Tres%20Marias%20raccoon">Tres Marias raccoon</a>, which is larger than average and has an angular skull; and the <a href="extinction">extinct</a> <a href="Barbados%20raccoon">Barbados raccoon</a>. Studies of their morphological and genetic traits in 1999, 2003 and 2005 led all these <a href="island%20raccoon">island raccoon</a>s to be listed as <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the common raccoon in "Mammal Species of the World's" third edition. A fifth island raccoon population, the <a href="Cozumel%20raccoon">Cozumel raccoon</a>, which weighs only and has notably small teeth, is still regarded as a separate species.

The four smallest raccoon subspecies, with a typical weight of , live along the southern coast of <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and on the adjacent islands; an example is the Ten Thousand Islands raccoon ("Procyon lotor marinus"). Most of the other 15 subspecies differ only slightly from each other in coat color, size and other physical characteristics. The two most widespread subspecies are the eastern raccoon ("Procyon lotor lotor") and the Upper Mississippi Valley raccoon ("Procyon lotor hirtus"). Both share a comparatively dark coat with long hairs, but the Upper Mississippi Valley raccoon is larger than the eastern raccoon. The eastern raccoon occurs in all U.S. states and Canadian provinces to the north of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> and <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>. The adjacent range of the Upper Mississippi Valley raccoon covers all U.S. states and Canadian provinces to the north of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>.

The taxonomic identity of feral raccoons inhabiting Central Europe, Causasia and Japan is unknown, as the founding populations consisted of uncategorized specimens from zoos and fur farms.

Head to hindquarters, raccoons measure between , not including the bushy tail which can
measure between , but is usually not much longer than . The shoulder height is between . The body weight of an adult raccoon varies considerably with <a href="habitat">habitat</a>, making the raccoon one of the most variably sized mammals. It can range from , but is usually between . The smallest specimens live in southern Florida, while those near the northern limits of the raccoon's range tend to be the largest (see <a href="Bergmann%27s%20rule">Bergmann's rule</a>). Males are usually 15 to 20% heavier than females. At the beginning of winter, a raccoon can weigh twice as much as in spring because of fat storage. The largest recorded wild raccoon weighed and measured in total length, by far the largest size recorded for a procyonid.

The most characteristic physical feature of the raccoon is the area of black <a href="fur">fur</a> around the eyes, which contrasts sharply with the surrounding white face coloring. This is reminiscent of a "<a href="Domino%20mask">bandit's mask</a>" and has thus enhanced the animal's reputation for mischief. The slightly rounded ears are also bordered by white fur. Raccoons are assumed to recognize the facial expression and posture of other members of their species more quickly because of the conspicuous facial coloration and the alternating light and dark rings on the tail. The dark mask may also reduce <a href="glare%20%28vision%29">glare</a> and thus enhance <a href="night%20vision">night vision</a>. On other parts of the body, the long and stiff <a href="guard%20hair">guard hair</a>s, which shed moisture, are usually colored in shades of gray and, to a lesser extent, brown. Raccoons with a very dark coat are more common in the German population because individuals with such coloring were among those initially released to the wild. The dense <a href="underfur">underfur</a>, which accounts for almost 90% of the coat, insulates against cold weather and is composed of long hairs.

The raccoon, whose method of <a href="Terrestrial%20locomotion">locomotion</a> is usually considered to be <a href="plantigrade">plantigrade</a>, can stand on its hind legs to examine objects with its front paws. As raccoons have short legs compared to their compact torso, they are usually not able either to run quickly or jump great distances. Their top speed over short distances is . Raccoons can swim with an average speed of about and can stay in the water for several hours. For climbing down a tree headfirst—an unusual ability for a mammal of its size—a raccoon rotates its hind feet so they are pointing backwards. Raccoons have a dual cooling system to <a href="Thermoregulation">regulate their temperature</a>; that is, they are able to both sweat and pant for heat dissipation.

Raccoon skulls have a short and wide facial region and a voluminous <a href="braincase">braincase</a>. The <a href="Facial%20skeleton">facial</a> length of the skull is less than the <a href="Neurocranium">cranial</a>, and their <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s are short and quite broad. The <a href="auditory%20bulla">auditory bulla</a>e are inflated in form, and the <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> is weakly developed. The <a href="dentition">dentition</a>—40 teeth with the <a href="dental%20formula">dental formula</a>:—is adapted to their <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a> diet: the <a href="carnassial">carnassial</a>s are not as sharp and pointed as those of a full-time <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>, but the <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> are not as wide as those of a <a href="herbivory">herbivore</a>. The <a href="baculum">penis bone</a> of males is about long and strongly bent at the front end. Juvenile males are distinguished from mature males by the shape and extrusibility of their penis bones. Seven of the thirteen identified vocal calls are used in <a href="Animal%20communication">communication</a> between the mother and her kits, one of these being the birdlike twittering of newborns.

The most important sense for the raccoon is its <a href="Somatosensory%20system">sense of touch</a>. The "hyper sensitive" front paws are protected by a thin <a href="Stratum%20corneum">horny layer</a> that becomes pliable when wet. The five digits of the paws have no webbing between them, which is unusual for a <a href="carnivoran">carnivoran</a>. Almost two-thirds of the area responsible for <a href="perception">sensory perception</a> in the raccoon's <a href="cerebral%20cortex">cerebral cortex</a> is specialized for the interpretation of tactile impulses, more than in any other studied animal. They are able to identify objects before touching them with <a href="vibrissa">vibrissa</a>e located above their sharp, nonretractable <a href="claw">claw</a>s. The raccoon's paws lack an opposable <a href="thumb">thumb</a>; thus, it does not have the agility of the hands of <a href="primate">primate</a>s. There is no observed negative effect on tactile perception when a raccoon stands in water below 10 °C (50 °F) for hours.

Raccoons are thought to be <a href="color%20blindness">color blind</a> or at least poorly able to distinguish color, though their eyes are well-adapted for sensing green light. Although their <a href="accommodation%20%28eye%29">accommodation</a> of 11 <a href="dioptre">dioptre</a> is comparable to that of humans and they see well in twilight because of the <a href="tapetum%20lucidum">tapetum lucidum</a> behind the <a href="retina">retina</a>, <a href="visual%20perception">visual perception</a> is of subordinate importance to raccoons because of their poor long-distance vision. In addition to being useful for orientation in the dark, their <a href="olfaction">sense of smell</a> is important for intraspecific communication. Glandular <a href="secretion">secretion</a>s (usually from their <a href="anal%20glands">anal glands</a>), urine and feces are used for marking. With their broad <a href="hearing%20%28sense%29">auditory range</a>, they can perceive tones up to 50–85 <a href="Hertz">kHz</a> as well as quiet noises, like those produced by <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s underground.

Zoologist <a href="Clinton%20Hart%20Merriam">Clinton Hart Merriam</a> described raccoons as "clever beasts", and that "in certain directions their cunning surpasses that of the fox." The animal's intelligence gave rise to the epithet "sly coon". Only a few studies have been undertaken to determine the mental abilities of raccoons, most of them based on the animal's sense of touch. In a study by the <a href="ethology">ethologist</a> H. B. Davis in 1908, raccoons were able to open 11 of 13 complex locks in fewer than 10 tries and had no problems repeating the action when the locks were rearranged or turned upside down. Davis concluded they understood the <a href="abstraction">abstract</a> principles of the locking mechanisms and their <a href="learning%20speed">learning speed</a> was equivalent to that of <a href="rhesus%20macaque">rhesus macaque</a>s.

Studies in 1963, 1973, 1975 and 1992 concentrated on raccoon <a href="memory">memory</a> showed they can remember the solutions to tasks for at least three years. In a study by B. Pohl in 1992, raccoons were able to instantly differentiate between identical and different symbols three years after the short initial learning phase. <a href="Stanislas%20Dehaene">Stanislas Dehaene</a> reports in his book "The Number Sense" that raccoons can distinguish boxes containing two or four grapes from those containing three. In research by <a href="Suzana%20Herculano-Houzel">Suzana Herculano-Houzel</a> and other <a href="neuroscientist">neuroscientist</a>s, raccoons have been found to be comparable to <a href="primate">primate</a>s in density of <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s in the <a href="cerebral%20cortex">cerebral cortex</a>, which they have proposed to be a <a href="neuroanatomy">neuroanatomical</a> indicator of intelligence.

Studies in the 1990s by the ethologists Stanley D. Gehrt and <a href="Ulf%20Hohmann">Ulf Hohmann</a> suggest that raccoons engage in gender-specific <a href="social%20behavior">social behavior</a>s and are not typically solitary, as was previously thought. Related females often live in a so-called "<a href="fission-fusion%20society">fission-fusion society</a>"; that is, they share a common area and occasionally meet at feeding or resting grounds. Unrelated males often form loose male social groups to maintain their position against foreign males during the <a href="mating%20season">mating season</a>—or against other potential invaders. Such a group does not usually consist of more than four individuals. Since some males show aggressive behavior towards unrelated kits, mothers will isolate themselves from other raccoons until their kits are big enough to defend themselves.

With respect to these three different modes of life prevalent among raccoons, Hohmann called their <a href="social%20structure">social structure</a> a "three-class society". Samuel I. Zeveloff, professor of <a href="zoology">zoology</a> at <a href="Weber%20State%20University">Weber State University</a> and author of the book "Raccoons: A Natural History", is more cautious in his interpretation and concludes at least the females are solitary most of the time and, according to Erik K. Fritzell's study in <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> in 1978, males in areas with low population densities are solitary as well.

The shape and size of a raccoon's <a href="home%20range">home range</a> varies depending on age, sex, and habitat, with adults claiming areas more than twice as large as juveniles. While the size of home ranges in the habitat of North Dakota's <a href="prairie">prairie</a>s lie between for males and between for females, the average size in a <a href="marsh">marsh</a> at <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a> was . Irrespective of whether the home ranges of adjacent groups overlap, they are most likely not actively defended outside the mating season if food supplies are sufficient. Odor marks on prominent spots are assumed to establish home ranges and identify individuals. Urine and feces left at shared <a href="raccoon%20latrine">raccoon latrine</a>s may provide additional information about feeding grounds, since raccoons were observed to meet there later for collective eating, sleeping and playing.

Concerning the general behavior patterns of raccoons, Gehrt points out that "typically you'll find 10 to 15 percent that will do the opposite" of what is expected.

Though usually nocturnal, the raccoon is sometimes active in daylight to take advantage of available food sources. Its diet consists of about 40% <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, 33% <a href="plant">plant</a> material and 27% <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s. Since its diet consists of such a variety of different foods, Zeveloff argues the raccoon "may well be one of the world's most omnivorous animals". While its diet in spring and early summer consists mostly of insects, worms, and other animals already available early in the year, it prefers fruits and nuts, such as <a href="acorn">acorn</a>s and walnuts, which emerge in late summer and autumn, and represent a rich calorie source for building up fat needed for winter. Contrary to popular belief, raccoons only occasionally eat active or large prey, such as <a href="bird">bird</a>s and <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s.
They prefer prey that is easier to catch, specifically <a href="fish">fish</a>, <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s and bird eggs. When food is plentiful, raccoons can develop strong individual preferences for specific foods. In the northern parts of their range, raccoons go into a <a href="winter%20rest">winter rest</a>, reducing their activity drastically as long as a permanent snow cover makes searching for food impossible.

One aspect of raccoon behavior is so well known that it gives the animal part of its scientific name, "Procyon lotor"; "lotor" is neo-Latin for "washer". In the wild, raccoons often dabble for underwater food near the shore-line. They then often pick up the food item with their front paws to examine it and rub the item, sometimes to remove unwanted parts. This gives the appearance of the raccoon "washing" the food. The tactile sensitivity of raccoons' paws is increased if this rubbing action is performed underwater, since the water softens the hard layer covering the paws. However, the behavior observed in captive raccoons in which they carry their food to water to "wash" or douse it before eating has not been observed in the wild. <a href="Natural%20history">Naturalist</a> <a href="Georges-Louis%20Leclerc%2C%20Comte%20de%20Buffon">Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon</a>, believed that raccoons do not have adequate <a href="salivary%20gland">saliva production</a> to moisten food thereby necessitating dousing, but this hypothesis is now considered to be incorrect. Captive raccoons douse their food more frequently when a watering hole with a layout similar to a stream is not farther away than . The widely accepted theory is that dousing in captive raccoons is a <a href="fixed%20action%20pattern">fixed action pattern</a> from the dabbling behavior performed when foraging at shores for aquatic foods. This is supported by the observation that aquatic foods are doused more frequently. Cleaning dirty food does not seem to be a reason for "washing". Experts have cast doubt on the veracity of observations of wild raccoons dousing food.

Raccoons usually <a href="mating">mate</a> in a period triggered by increasing daylight between late January and mid-March. However, there are large regional differences which are not completely explicable by solar conditions. For example, while raccoons in southern states typically mate later than average, the mating season in <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> also peaks later than usual in March and extends until June. During the mating season, males restlessly roam their home ranges in search of females in an attempt to court them during the three- to four-day period when conception is possible. These encounters will often occur at central meeting places. <a href="Copulation%20%28zoology%29">Copulation</a>, including foreplay, can last over an hour and is repeated over several nights. The weaker members of a "male social group" also are assumed to get the opportunity to mate, since the stronger ones cannot mate with all available females. In a study in southern Texas during the mating seasons from 1990 to 1992, about one third of all females mated with more than one male. If a female does not become <a href="pregnancy">pregnant</a> or if she loses her kits early, she will sometimes become fertile again 80 to 140 days later.

After usually 63 to 65 days of <a href="gestation">gestation</a> (although anywhere from 54 to 70 days is possible), a <a href="litter%20%28animal%29">litter</a> of typically two to five young is born. The average litter size varies widely with habitat, ranging from 2.5 in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> to 4.8 in <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a>. Larger litters are more common in areas with a high mortality rate, due, for example, to <a href="hunting">hunting</a> or severe winters. While male yearlings usually reach their sexual maturity only after the main mating season, female yearlings can compensate for high mortality rates and may be responsible for about 50% of all young born in a year. Males have no part in raising young. The kits (also called "cubs") are blind and deaf at birth, but their mask is already visible against their light fur. The birth weight of the about -long kits is between . Their ear canals open after around 18 to 23 days, a few days before their eyes open for the first time. Once the kits weigh about , they begin to explore outside the den, consuming solid food for the first time after six to nine weeks. After this point, their mother <a href="Lactation">suckles</a> them with decreasing frequency; they are usually weaned by 16 weeks. In the fall, after their mother has shown them dens and feeding grounds, the juvenile group splits up. While many females will stay close to the home range of their mother, males can sometimes move more than away. This is considered an <a href="instinct">instinct</a>ive behavior, preventing <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a>. However, mother and offspring may share a den during the first winter in cold areas.

Captive raccoons have been known to live for more than 20 years. However, the species' life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years, depending on the local conditions in terms of traffic volume, hunting, and weather severity. It is not unusual for only half of the young born in one year to survive a full year. After this point, the annual mortality rate drops to between 10% and 30%. Young raccoons are vulnerable to losing their mother and to starvation, particularly in long and cold winters. The most frequent natural cause of death in the North American raccoon population is <a href="Canine%20distemper">distemper</a>, which can reach <a href="epidemic">epidemic</a> proportions and kill most of a local raccoon population. In areas with heavy vehicular traffic and extensive hunting, these factors can account for up to 90% of all deaths of adult raccoons. Due to a broad range of range overlap with these predators, the most important natural <a href="predation">predators</a> of the raccoon are <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s, and <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a>s, the latter mainly preying on young raccoons but capable of killing adults in some cases. In <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, they have been reported to fall victim to larger carnivores like <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a> and <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s and these species may also be a threat on occasion in other areas. Also in the southeast, they are among the favored prey for adult <a href="American%20alligator">American alligator</a>s. On occasion, both <a href="Bald%20eagle">bald</a> and <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s will prey on raccoons. In rare cases of overlap, they may fall victim from carnivores ranging from species averaging smaller than themselves such as <a href="Fisher%20%28animal%29">fishers</a> to those as large and formidable as <a href="jaguar">jaguar</a>s in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. In their introduced range in the former Soviet Union, their main predators are <a href="wolf">wolves</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20lynx">lynxes</a> and <a href="eagle%20owl">eagle owl</a>s. However, predation is not a significant cause of death, especially because larger predators have been <a href="Holocene%20extinction%20event">exterminated</a> in many areas inhabited by raccoons.

Although they have thrived in sparsely wooded areas in the last decades, raccoons depend on vertical structures to climb when they feel threatened. Therefore, they avoid open terrain and areas with high concentrations of <a href="beech">beech</a> trees, as beech <a href="Bark%20%28botany%29">bark</a> is too smooth to climb. <a href="Tree%20hollow">Tree hollow</a>s in old <a href="oak">oak</a>s or other trees and rock crevices are preferred by raccoons as sleeping, winter and litter dens. If such dens are unavailable or accessing them is inconvenient, raccoons use <a href="burrow">burrow</a>s dug by other mammals, dense <a href="undergrowth">undergrowth</a> or tree crotches. In a study in the <a href="Solling">Solling</a> range of hills in Germany, more than 60% of all sleeping places were used only once, but those used at least ten times accounted for about 70% of all uses. Since amphibians, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, and other animals around the shore of lakes and rivers are an important part of the raccoon's diet, lowland <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> or <a href="Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forests">mixed forests</a> abundant with water and marshes sustain the highest population densities. While population densities range from 0.5 to 3.2 animals per square kilometer (1.3 to 8.3 animals per square mile) in prairies and do not usually exceed 6 animals per square kilometer (15.5 animals per square mile) in upland hardwood forests, more than 20 raccoons per square kilometer (51.8 animals per square mile) can live in lowland forests and marshes.

Raccoons are common throughout North America from Canada to <a href="Panama">Panama</a>, where the subspecies "Procyon lotor pumilus" coexists with the <a href="crab-eating%20raccoon">crab-eating raccoon</a> ("Procyon cancrivorus"). The population on <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> was exterminated as early as 1513 by Spanish colonists who hunted them for their meat. Raccoons were also exterminated in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> and <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, where the last sightings were reported in 1687. When they were still considered separate species, the Bahamas raccoon, Guadeloupe raccoon and Tres Marias raccoon were classified as <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a> in 1996.

There is archeological evidence that in <a href="Pre-Columbian%20era">pre-Columbian</a> times raccoons were numerous only along rivers and in the woodlands of the <a href="Southeastern%20United%20States">Southeastern United States</a>. As raccoons were not mentioned in earlier reports of <a href="American%20pioneer">pioneers</a> exploring the central and north-central parts of the United States, their initial spread may have begun a few decades before the 20th century. Since the 1950s, raccoons have expanded their range from <a href="Vancouver%20Island">Vancouver Island</a>—formerly the northernmost limit of their range—far into the northern portions of the four south-central Canadian provinces. New habitats which have recently been occupied by raccoons (aside from urban areas) include mountain ranges, such as the <a href="Western%20Rocky%20Mountains">Western Rocky Mountains</a>, prairies and <a href="Salt%20marsh">coastal marshes</a>. After a population explosion starting in the 1940s, the estimated number of raccoons in North America in the late 1980s was 15 to 20 times higher than in the 1930s, when raccoons were comparatively rare. <a href="Urbanization">Urbanization</a>, the expansion of <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, deliberate introductions, and the extermination of natural predators of the raccoon have probably caused this increase in abundance and distribution.

As a result of escapes and deliberate <a href="introduced%20species">introductions</a> in the mid-20th century, the raccoon is now distributed in several European and Asian countries. Sightings have occurred in all the countries bordering Germany, which hosts the largest population outside of North America. Another stable population exists in northern France, where several pet raccoons were released by members of the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a> near the <a href="Laon-Couvron%20Air%20Base">Laon-Couvron Air Base</a> in 1966. Furthermore, raccoons have been known to be in the area around <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> since the early 1970s. In 2013, the city authorized "the capture and death of any specimen". It is also present in <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, with one reproductive population in <a href="Lombardy">Lombardy</a>.

About 1,240 animals were released in nine regions of the former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> between 1936 and 1958 for the purpose of establishing a population to be hunted for their fur. Two of these introductions were successful—one in the south of <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a> between 1954 and 1958, and another in <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> between 1941 and 1957. With a seasonal harvest of between 1,000 and 1,500 animals, in 1974 the estimated size of the population distributed in the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> region was around 20,000 animals and the density was four animals per square kilometer (10 animals per square mile).

In Japan, up to 1,500 raccoons were imported as pets each year after the success of the <a href="anime">anime</a> series "<a href="Rascal%20the%20Raccoon">Rascal the Raccoon</a>" (1977). In 2004, the descendants of discarded or escaped animals lived in 42 of 47 <a href="Prefectures%20of%20Japan">prefectures</a>.
The range of raccoons in the wild in Japan grew from 17 prefectures in 2000 to all 47 prefectures in 2008. It is estimated that raccoons cause thirty million yen of agricultural damage on Hokkaido alone.

In Germany—where the raccoon is called the (literally, "wash-bear" or "washing bear") due to its habit of "dousing" food in water—two pairs of pet raccoons were released into the German countryside at the <a href="Edersee">Edersee</a> reservoir in the north of <a href="Hesse">Hesse</a> in April 1934 by a forester upon request of their owner, a poultry farmer. He released them two weeks before receiving permission from the <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n hunting office to "enrich the <a href="fauna">fauna</a>." Several prior attempts to introduce raccoons in Germany were not successful. A second population was established in eastern Germany in 1945 when 25 raccoons escaped from a <a href="fur%20farming">fur farm</a> at Wolfshagen (today district of <a href="Altlandsberg">Altlandsberg</a>), east of Berlin, after an air strike. The two populations are parasitologically distinguishable: 70% of the raccoons of the Hessian population are infected with the <a href="Nematode">roundworm</a> "<a href="Baylisascaris%20procyonis">Baylisascaris procyonis</a>", but none of the <a href="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a>ian population has the parasite. The estimated number of raccoons was 285 animals in the Hessian region in 1956, over 20,000 animals in the Hessian region in 1970 and between 200,000 and 400,000 animals in the whole of Germany in 2008. By 2012 it was estimated that Germany now had more than a million raccoons.
The raccoon was a protected species in Germany, but has been declared a <a href="game%20%28food%29">game animal</a> in 14 of the 16 <a href="States%20of%20Germany">states</a> since 1954. Hunters and <a href="environmentalism">environmentalists</a> argue the raccoon spreads uncontrollably, threatens protected bird species and supersedes domestic <a href="carnivora">carnivora</a>ns. This view is opposed by the zoologist Frank-Uwe Michler, who finds no evidence a high population density of raccoons has negative effects on the <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> of an area. Hohmann holds that extensive hunting cannot be justified by the absence of natural predators, because predation is not a significant cause of death in the North American raccoon population.
The raccoon is extensively hunted in Germany as they are seen as an <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> and <a href="Pest%20%28organism%29">pests</a>. In the 1990s, only about 400 raccoons were hunted yearly. This increased to 67,700 by the 2010/11 hunting season and the tally broke the 100,000 barrier in 2013. During the 2015/16 hunting season, the tally was 128,100 animals, 60 percent of which were provided by the federal states of <a href="Hesse">Hesse</a>.

Experiments in acclimatising raccoons into the USSR began in 1936, and were repeated a further 25 times until 1962. Overall, 1,222 individuals were released, 64 of which came from zoos and fur farms (38 of them having been imports from western Europe). The remainder originated from a population previously established in <a href="Transcaucasia">Transcaucasia</a>. The range of Soviet raccoons was never single or continuous, as they were often introduced to different locations far from each other. All introductions into the <a href="Russian%20Far%20East">Russian Far East</a> failed; melanistic raccoons were released on Petrov Island near <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> and some areas of southern <a href="Primorsky%20Krai">Primorsky Krai</a>, but died. In <a href="Middle%20Asia">Middle Asia</a>, raccoons were released in <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>'s <a href="Jalal-Abad%20Province">Jalal-Abad Province</a>, though they were later recorded as "practically absent" there in January 1963. A large and stable raccoon population (yielding 1000–1500 catches a year) was established in <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> after an introduction to the area in 1937. Raccoons apparently survived an introduction near <a href="Terek%20River">Terek</a>, along the <a href="Sulak%20River">Sulak River</a> into the <a href="Dagestan">Dagestan</a>i lowlands. Attempts to settle raccoons on the <a href="Kuban%20River">Kuban River</a>'s left tributary and <a href="Kabardino-Balkaria">Kabardino-Balkaria</a> were unsuccessful. A successful acclimatization occurred in <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>, where three introductions (consisting of 52, 37 and 38 individuals in 1954 and 1958) took place. By January 1, 1963, 700 individuals were recorded in the country.

Due to its adaptability, the raccoon has been able to use <a href="urban%20area">urban area</a>s as a habitat. The first sightings were recorded in a <a href="suburb">suburb</a> of <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> in the 1920s. Since the 1950s, raccoons have been present in <a href="metropolitan%20area">metropolitan area</a>s like <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>. Since the 2010s, a nuisance population of raccoons has been present in <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>. Since the 1960s, <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a> has hosted Europe's first and densest population in a large urban area, with about 50 to 150 animals per square kilometer (130 to 390 animals per square mile), a figure comparable to those of urban habitats in North America. Home range sizes of urban raccoons are only 3 to 40 hectares (7.5 to 100 acres) for females and 8 to 80 hectares (20 to 200 acres) for males. In small towns and suburbs, many raccoons sleep in a nearby forest after foraging in the settlement area. Fruit and insects in gardens and leftovers in municipal waste are easily available food sources. Furthermore, a large number of additional sleeping areas exist in these areas, such as hollows in old garden trees, cottages, garages, abandoned houses, and attics. The percentage of urban raccoons sleeping in abandoned or occupied houses varies from 15% in Washington, DC (1991) to 43% in Kassel (2003).

Raccoons can carry <a href="rabies">rabies</a>, a lethal disease caused by the <a href="neurotropic%20virus">neurotropic</a> rabies <a href="virus">virus</a> carried in the <a href="saliva">saliva</a> and transmitted by bites. Its spread began in Florida and <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> in the 1950s and was facilitated by the introduction of infected individuals to <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and North Dakota in the late 1970s. Of the 6,940 documented rabies cases reported in the United States in 2006, 2,615 (37.7%) were in raccoons. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>, as well as local authorities in several U.S. states and Canadian provinces, has developed oral <a href="vaccination">vaccination</a> programs to fight the spread of the disease in endangered populations. Only one human fatality has been reported after transmission of the rabies virus strain commonly known as "raccoon rabies". Among the main symptoms for rabies in raccoons are a generally sickly appearance, impaired mobility, abnormal vocalization, and <a href="aggression">aggressiveness</a>. There may be no visible signs at all, however, and most individuals do not show the aggressive behavior seen in infected canids; rabid raccoons will often retire to their dens instead. Organizations like the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a> encourage people to stay away from animals with unusual behavior or appearance, and to notify the proper authorities, such as an <a href="animal%20control%20officer">animal control officer</a> from the local <a href="health%20department">health department</a>. Since healthy animals, especially nursing mothers, will occasionally forage during the day, daylight activity is not a reliable indicator of illness in raccoons.

Unlike rabies and at least a dozen other <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s carried by raccoons, <a href="Canine%20distemper">distemper</a>, an <a href="epizootic">epizootic</a> virus, does not affect humans. This disease is the most frequent natural cause of death in the North American raccoon population and affects individuals of all age groups. For example, 94 of 145 raccoons died during an outbreak in <a href="Clifton%2C%20Ohio">Clifton, Ohio</a>, in 1968. It may occur along with a following inflammation of the brain (<a href="encephalitis">encephalitis</a>), causing the animal to display rabies-like symptoms. In Germany, the first eight cases of distemper were reported in 2007.

Some of the most important <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>l diseases which affect raccoons are <a href="leptospirosis">leptospirosis</a>, <a href="listeriosis">listeriosis</a>, <a href="tetanus">tetanus</a>, and <a href="tularemia">tularemia</a>. Although internal <a href="parasitism">parasites</a> weaken their <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>s, well-fed individuals can carry a great many roundworms in their <a href="Gastrointestinal%20tract">digestive tracts</a> without showing symptoms. The larvae of the roundworm "<a href="Baylisascaris%20procyonis">Baylisascaris procyonis</a>", which can be contained in the feces and seldom causes a severe illness in humans, can be ingested when cleaning <a href="raccoon%20latrine">raccoon latrine</a>s without wearing breathing protection.

While not endemic, the worm "<a href="Trichinella">Trichinella</a>" does infect raccoons, and undercooked raccoon meat has caused <a href="trichinosis">trichinosis</a> in humans.

Trematode "<a href="Metorchis%20conjunctus">Metorchis conjunctus</a>" can also infect raccoons.

The increasing number of raccoons in urban areas has resulted in diverse reactions in humans, ranging from outrage at their presence to deliberate feeding. Some wildlife experts and most public authorities caution against feeding wild animals because they might become increasingly obtrusive and dependent on humans as a food source. Other experts challenge such arguments and give advice on feeding raccoons and other wildlife in their books. Raccoons without a fear of humans are a concern to those who attribute this trait to rabies, but scientists point out this behavior is much more likely to be a behavioral adjustment to living in habitats with regular contact to humans for many generations. Raccoons usually do not prey on domestic cats and dogs, but isolated cases of killings have been reported. Attacks on pets may also target their owners.

While overturned waste containers and raided fruit trees are just a nuisance to homeowners, it can cost several thousand dollars to repair damage caused by the use of attic space as dens. Relocating or killing raccoons without a permit is forbidden in many urban areas on grounds of <a href="animal%20welfare">animal welfare</a>. These methods usually only solve problems with particularly wild or aggressive individuals, since adequate dens are either known to several raccoons or will quickly be rediscovered. Loud noises, flashing lights and unpleasant odors have proven particularly effective in driving away a mother and her kits before they would normally leave the nesting place (when the kits are about eight weeks old). Typically, though, only precautionary measures to restrict access to food waste and den sites are effective in the long term.

Among all fruits and crops cultivated in agricultural areas, <a href="sweet%20corn">sweet corn</a> in its milk stage is particularly popular among raccoons. In a two-year study by <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a> researchers, published in 2004, raccoons were responsible for 87% of the damage to corn plants. Like other predators, raccoons searching for food can break into <a href="poultry">poultry</a> houses to feed on chickens, ducks, their eggs, or food.

Since raccoons in high mortality areas have a higher rate of reproduction, extensive hunting may not solve problems with raccoon populations. Older males also claim larger home ranges than younger ones, resulting in a lower population density.

In the <a href="mythology">mythology</a> of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, the raccoon is the subject of <a href="Folklore">folk tales</a>. Stories such as "How raccoons catch so many <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a>" from the <a href="Tuscarora%20%28tribe%29">Tuscarora</a> centered on its skills at foraging. In other tales, the raccoon played the role of the <a href="trickster">trickster</a> which outsmarts other animals, like coyotes and wolves. Among others, the <a href="Dakota%20Sioux">Dakota Sioux</a> believe the raccoon has natural spirit powers, since its mask resembled the facial paintings, two-fingered swashes of black and white, used during <a href="ritual">ritual</a>s to connect to spirit beings. The Aztecs linked supernatural abilities especially to females, whose commitment to their young was associated with the role of wise women in their society.

The raccoon also appears in Native American art across a wide geographic range. <a href="Petroglyph">Petroglyph</a>s with engraved raccoon tracks were found in Lewis Canyon, Texas; at the Crow Hollow petroglyph site in <a href="Grayson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Grayson County, Kentucky</a>; and in river drainages near <a href="Tularosa">Tularosa</a>, New Mexico and <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, California. A true-to-detail <a href="figurine">figurine</a> made of <a href="quartz">quartz</a>, the "Ohio Mound Builders' Stone Pipe", was found near the <a href="Scioto%20River">Scioto River</a>. The meaning and significance of the "Raccoon Priests Gorget", which features a stylized carving of a raccoon and was found at the <a href="Spiro%20Mounds">Spiro Mounds</a>, Oklahoma, remains unknown.

In Western culture, several <a href="autobiography">autobiographical</a> <a href="novel">novel</a>s about living with a raccoon have been written, mostly for <a href="Children%27s%20literature">children</a>. The best-known is <a href="Sterling%20North">Sterling North</a>'s "<a href="Rascal%20%28book%29">Rascal</a>", which recounts how he raised a kit during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. In recent years, <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> raccoons played main roles in the animated television series "<a href="The%20Raccoons">The Raccoons</a>", the computer-animated film "<a href="Over%20the%20Hedge%20%28film%29">Over the Hedge</a>", the live action film "<a href="Guardians%20of%20the%20Galaxy%20%28film%29">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>" (<a href="Rocket%20Raccoon">and the comics that it was based upon</a>) and the video game series "<a href="Sly%20Cooper%20%28series%29">Sly Cooper</a>".

The fur of raccoons is used for clothing, especially for <a href="Raccoon%20coat">coats</a> and <a href="coonskin%20cap">coonskin cap</a>s. At present, it is the material used for the inaccurately named "sealskin" cap worn by the <a href="Royal%20Fusiliers">Royal Fusiliers</a> of <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>. <a href="Sporran">Sporran</a>s made of raccoon pelt and hide have sometimes been used as part of traditional <a href="Highland%20dress">Scottish highland men's apparel</a> since the 18th Century, especially in North America. Such sporrans may or may not be of the "full-mask" type. Historically, <a href="Indigenous%20people%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> tribes not only used the fur for winter clothing, but also used the tails for ornament. The famous Sioux leader <a href="Spotted%20Tail">Spotted Tail</a> took his name from a raccoon skin hat with the tail attached he acquired from a fur trader. Since the late 18th century, various types of <a href="scent%20hound">scent hound</a>s, called "<a href="coonhound">coonhound</a>s", which are able to tree animals have been bred in the United States. In the 19th century, when coonskins occasionally even served as means of payment, several thousand raccoons were killed each year in the United States. This number rose quickly when <a href="Car%20coat">automobile coats</a> became popular after the turn of the 20th century. In the 1920s, wearing a <a href="raccoon%20coat">raccoon coat</a> was regarded as <a href="status%20symbol">status symbol</a> among <a href="college%20student">college student</a>s. Attempts to breed raccoons in fur farms in the 1920s and 1930s in North America and Europe turned out not to be profitable, and farming was abandoned after prices for long-haired pelts dropped in the 1940s. Although raccoons had become rare in the 1930s, at least 388,000 were killed during the <a href="hunting%20season">hunting season</a> of 1934/35.

After persistent population increases began in the 1940s, the seasonal <a href="coon%20hunting">coon hunting</a> harvest reached about one million animals in 1946/47 and two million in 1962/63. The broadcast of three television episodes about the <a href="Frontier%23American%20frontier">frontiersman</a> <a href="Davy%20Crockett">Davy Crockett</a> and the film "<a href="Davy%20Crockett%2C%20King%20of%20the%20Wild%20Frontier">Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier</a>" in 1954 and 1955 led to a high demand for <a href="coonskin%20cap">coonskin cap</a>s in the United States, although it is unlikely either Crockett or the actor who played him, <a href="Fess%20Parker">Fess Parker</a>, actually wore a cap made from raccoon fur. The seasonal hunt reached an all-time high with 5.2 million animals in 1976/77 and ranged between 3.2 and 4.7 million for most of the 1980s. In 1982, the average pelt price was $20. As of 1987, the raccoon was identified as the most important wild furbearer in North America in terms of revenue. In the first half of the 1990s, the seasonal hunt dropped to 0.9 from 1.9 million due to decreasing pelt prices.

While primarily hunted for their fur, raccoons were also a source of food for Native Americans and early American settlers. According to <a href="Ernest%20Thompson%20Seton">Ernest Thompson Seton</a>, young specimens killed without a fight are palatable, whereas old raccoons caught after a lengthy battle are inedible. Raccoon meat was extensively eaten during the early years of California, where it was sold in the San Francisco market for $1–3 apiece. <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">American slaves</a> occasionally ate raccoon at <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>, but it was not necessarily a dish of the poor or rural. The first edition of "<a href="The%20Joy%20of%20Cooking">The Joy of Cooking</a>", released in 1931, contained a recipe for preparing raccoon, and US President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>'s pet raccoon Rebecca was originally sent to be served at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> <a href="Thanksgiving%20dinner">Thanksgiving Dinner</a>. Although the idea of eating raccoons seems repulsive to most mainstream consumers since they see them as endearing, cute, and/or <a href="vermin">vermin</a>, several thousand raccoons are still eaten each year in the United States, primarily in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern United States</a>.

Raccoons are sometimes kept as <a href="pet">pet</a>s, which is discouraged by many experts because the raccoon is not a <a href="domestication">domesticated</a> species. Raccoons may act unpredictably and aggressively and it is extremely difficult to teach them to obey commands. In places where keeping raccoons as pets is not forbidden, such as in Wisconsin and other U.S. states, an <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet</a> permit may be required. One notable raccoon pet was <a href="Rebecca%20%28raccoon%29">Rebecca</a>, kept by US president <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>.

Their propensity for unruly behavior exceeds that of <a href="Skunks%20as%20pets">captive skunks</a>, and they are even less trustworthy when allowed to roam freely. Because of their intelligence and nimble forelimbs, even inexperienced raccoons are easily capable of unscrewing jars, uncorking bottles and opening door latches, with more experienced specimens having been recorded to open door knobs. Sexually mature raccoons often show aggressive natural behaviors such as biting during the mating season. <a href="Neutering">Neutering</a> them at around five or six months of age decreases the chances of aggressive behavior developing. Raccoons can become <a href="obesity">obese</a> and suffer from other disorders due to poor diet and lack of exercise. When fed with <a href="cat%20food">cat food</a> over a long time period, raccoons can develop <a href="gout">gout</a>. With respect to the research results regarding their social behavior, it is now required by law in Austria and Germany to keep at least two individuals to prevent loneliness. Raccoons are usually kept in a <a href="pen%20%28enclosure%29">pen</a> (indoor or outdoor), also a legal requirement in Austria and Germany, rather than in the apartment where their natural <a href="curiosity">curiosity</a> may result in damage to property.

When orphaned, it is possible for kits to be <a href="wildlife%20rehabilitation">rehabilitated</a> and <a href="Reintroduction">reintroduced</a> to the wild. However, it is uncertain whether they readapt well to life in the wild. Feeding unweaned kits with <a href="cow%27s%20milk">cow's milk</a> rather than a kitten replacement milk or a similar product can be dangerous to their health.

Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's individual road race

The men's road race, a part of the <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">cycling events</a> at the <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">2008 Summer Olympics</a>, took place on August 9 at the <a href="Urban%20Road%20Cycling%20Course">Urban Road Cycling Course</a> in <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a>. It started at 11:00 <a href="China%20Standard%20Time">China Standard Time</a> (<a href="UTC%2B8">UTC+8</a>), and was scheduled to last until 17:30 later that day. The course ran north across the heart of the Beijing metropolitan area, passing such landmarks as the <a href="Temple%20of%20Heaven">Temple of Heaven</a>, the <a href="Great%20Hall%20of%20the%20People">Great Hall of the People</a>, <a href="Tiananmen%20Square">Tiananmen Square</a> and the <a href="Beijing%20National%20Stadium">Beijing National Stadium</a>. After rolling over relatively flat terrain for north of the Beijing city center, the route entered a decisive circuit encompassing seven loops on a section up and down the <a href="Badaling">Badaling Pass</a>, including ramps as steep as a 10 percent gradient.

The race was won by the Spanish rider <a href="Samuel%20S%C3%A1nchez">Samuel Sánchez</a> in 6 hours, 23 minutes, 49 seconds, after a six-man breakaway group contested a sprint finish. <a href="Davide%20Rebellin">Davide Rebellin</a> of Italy and <a href="Fabian%20Cancellara">Fabian Cancellara</a> of Switzerland, finishing second and third place with the same time as Sánchez, received silver and bronze medals respectively for the event. The hot and humid conditions were in sharp contrast to the heavy rain weathered in the <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20road%20race">women's road race</a> the following day.

The event was one of the earliest to be concluded at the 2008 Summer Olympics, taking place on the first day of competition. Concerns were raised before the Olympics about the threat of pollution in endurance sports, but no major problems were apparent in the race.

In April 2009, it was announced that Rebellin had tested positive for <a href="Continuous%20erythropoietin%20receptor%20activator">Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator</a> (CERA, a third-generation form of <a href="erythropoietin">erythropoietin</a>) during the Olympics. After his B-sample subsequently confirmed initial results, he returned his medal and repaid the prize money he had won from the <a href="Italian%20National%20Olympic%20Committee">Italian National Olympic Committee</a> (CONI) while still maintaining his innocence. Cancellara and original fourth-place finisher <a href="Alexandr%20Kolobnev">Alexandr Kolobnev</a> were later awarded new medals corresponding to their updated finishing positions.

Qualification for the race was restricted to five athletes per <a href="National%20Olympic%20Committee">National Olympic Committee</a> (NOC), providing that these athletes qualified through the <a href="Union%20Cycliste%20Internationale">Union Cycliste Internationale</a> (UCI) rankings, with the <a href="UCI%20ProTour">UCI ProTour</a> considered to be superior to the <a href="UCI%20Continental%20Circuits">UCI Continental Circuits</a>. The number of qualification places allocated varied among the different UCI tours, which all maintain their own ranking system. Any NOC unable to fill its quota of athletes from the ProTour was permitted to enter athletes from one of the continental tours, and if that was not feasible, from the "B" World Championship. The number of places allocated to each tour were thus (in descending order): 70 riders from the ProTour, 38 from the <a href="UCI%20Europe%20Tour">Europe tour</a>, 15 from the <a href="UCI%20America%20Tour">America tour</a>, nine from the <a href="UCI%20Asia%20Tour">Asia tour</a>, five from the <a href="UCI%20Africa%20Tour">Africa tour</a>, and three from the <a href="UCI%20Oceania%20Tour">Oceania tour</a>. Five entrants qualified through the <a href="UCI%20B%20World%20Championship%20Cycling">"B" World Championships</a>.

The final number of competitors was set to be 145, but only 143 athletes started the race. Four cyclists were scratched from the race shortly before it took place. <a href="Damiano%20Cunego">Damiano Cunego</a> of Italy had not yet recovered from the injuries he sustained in the <a href="2008%20Tour%20de%20France%2C%20Stage%2012%20to%20Stage%2021%23Stage%2018">2008 Tour de France</a>, so he was replaced by <a href="Vincenzo%20Nibali">Vincenzo Nibali</a>. Portugal's <a href="S%C3%A9rgio%20Paulinho">Sérgio Paulinho</a>, the silver medalist at the <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">2004 event</a>, was said to be in insufficient shape to race. After Russian <a href="Vladimir%20Gusev%20%28cyclist%29">Vladimir Gusev</a> was fired by his professional team for failing an internal doping check, he was replaced in this event by <a href="Denis%20Menchov">Denis Menchov</a>, who later competed in the time trial. While training earlier in the week before the race, Switzerland's <a href="Michael%20Albasini">Michael Albasini</a> crashed and broke his collarbone; there was not sufficient time to find a replacement for him.

Prior to the opening of the Games, the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the organizing body considered rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as <a href="asthma">asthma</a>.

Independent sources showed that pollution levels were above the limit deemed safe by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> on August 9. However, the cycling event went ahead as scheduled with no objections from the athletes. Fifty-three of the 143 cyclists pulled out during the race; however, this is not unusual (over half withdrew mid-race at the 2004 Summer Olympics). Post-race, a number of riders highlighted the punishing conditions, in particular the <a href="heat">heat</a> () and <a href="humidity">humidity</a> (90%), which were much higher than in Europe, where the majority of UCI ProTour races are held. Pollution, however, was not widely cited as a problem, though <a href="Stefan%20Schumacher">Stefan Schumacher</a> of Germany, who had been considered an outside favorite for victory in the event, said the elements and the pollution played a role in his withdrawal.

Among the pre-race favorites was the entire Spanish contingent of riders. It included two winners of <a href="Grand%20Tour%20%28cycling%29">Grand Tours</a> in <a href="Alberto%20Contador">Alberto Contador</a> and <a href="Carlos%20Sastre">Carlos Sastre</a>, along with highly regarded countrymen <a href="Alejandro%20Valverde">Alejandro Valverde</a>, winner of the <a href="2008%20Crit%C3%A9rium%20du%20Dauphin%C3%A9%20Lib%C3%A9r%C3%A9">2008 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré</a> and the reigning <a href="Spanish%20National%20Road%20Race%20Championships">Spanish national road race champion</a>, and <a href="Samuel%20S%C3%A1nchez">Samuel Sánchez</a>, who had won three stages in the <a href="2007%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">2007 Vuelta a España</a>. They also had 2008 Tour de France <a href="points%20classification">points classification</a> winner and three-time <a href="UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">world champion</a> <a href="%C3%93scar%20Freire">Óscar Freire</a> available to <a href="Bicycling%20terminology%23work">work</a> on their behalf. Valverde was seen as the strongest threat among the Spaniards. Other medal hopefuls included the defending Olympic champion <a href="Paolo%20Bettini">Paolo Bettini</a> of Italy, Germany's <a href="Stefan%20Schumacher">Stefan Schumacher</a>, and Australian <a href="Cadel%20Evans">Cadel Evans</a>, twice a runner-up in the <a href="Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a> (2007 and 2008). It was thought that members of the overall strong squads from Germany and Luxembourg could also contend for victory. The German team contained Schumacher and many veterans of Grand Tours such as <a href="Jens%20Voigt">Jens Voigt</a> to work in support, while Luxembourg had the Schleck brothers <a href="Andy%20Schleck">Andy</a> and <a href="Fr%C3%A4nk%20Schleck">Fränk</a>, along with <a href="Kim%20Kirchen">Kim Kirchen</a>, all of whom had worn leader's <a href="Cycling%20jersey">jerseys</a> during the 2008 Tour de France.

The <a href="Urban%20Road%20Cycling%20Course">Urban Road Cycling Course</a> (one of Beijing's nine temporary <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics%20venues">venues</a>) was in its entirety, and the men's race was a distance of , the longest in Olympic history. The race's starting line was located at the <a href="Yongdingmen">Yongdingmen</a>, a reconstructed gate of Beijing's <a href="Chinese%20city%20wall">old city wall</a>, which is a part of the <a href="Dongcheng%20District%2C%20Beijing">Dongcheng District</a> south of Beijing city center. The course ended at the <a href="Juyongguan">Juyong Pass</a> in the <a href="Changping%20District">Changping District</a>.

The men's race layout, which differed most significantly from the <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20road%20race">women's</a> in that it was over double its length, saw the riders make seven loops back-and-forth between the <a href="Badaling">Badaling</a> and Juyong Passes. The early sections of the race took place within central Beijing; consequently, the gradient of this part of the race was relatively flat. At approximately the point in the race the riders reached the Badaling section of the Great Wall, and began their first of seven loops. The riders encountered an increase in the gradient at this point, with the Badaling Pass gaining in elevation over a distance of from the start of the circuit to the highest point. From there the cyclists rode over a false flat before descending a highway towards the Juyong Pass. The final of the race gave the riders a moderately steep climb to contend with, which was designed to ensure an exciting finale should several riders have been grouped together at the end of the race, as there were.

Due to security regulations put in place by the Olympic organizers, no spectators were permitted to stand roadside along the course. This decision proved to be controversial: several prominent figures in cycling, including UCI president <a href="Pat%20McQuaid">Pat McQuaid</a> and riders <a href="Stuart%20O%27Grady">Stuart O'Grady</a> and <a href="Cadel%20Evans">Cadel Evans</a> (both Australia), spoke out against it. McQuaid and O'Grady both felt that the absence of people along the course deprived the race of the atmosphere present at other cycling events, and said that it failed to take supporters' wishes into consideration. <a href="Cycling%20Australia">Cycling Australia</a>'s reaction to the cyclists' complaints was to request that security restrictions be eased for the <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20time%20trial">time trial</a> to follow, but they were not.
The men's road race began at 11:00 local time (<a href="UTC%2B8">UTC+8</a>) and within of the start, <a href="Horacio%20Gallardo">Horacio Gallardo</a> (Bolivia) and <a href="Patricio%20Almonacid">Patricio Almonacid</a> (Chile) formed a two-man breakaway. They held a maximum advantage of 15 minutes, but were never really seen as a threat, and in fact neither went on to finish the race. With no single team willing to force the pace, a 26-man breakaway formed at the mark, including <a href="Carlos%20Sastre">Carlos Sastre</a> (Spain), <a href="Kim%20Kirchen">Kim Kirchen</a> (Luxembourg), <a href="Jens%20Voigt">Jens Voigt</a> (Germany), <a href="Roman%20Kreuziger">Roman Kreuziger</a> (Czech Republic) and <a href="Simon%20Gerrans">Simon Gerrans</a> (Australia). Shortly after the race reached the finish line to begin the first of seven loops, Gallardo was dropped by Almonacid. The lone Chilean leader was then caught by the now 24-man chase group at the summit on the second loop, after riding solo ahead of the pack for over an hour and a half.

Under the impetus of Sastre and Kreuziger in particular, the 24-strong breakaway group built their lead to over six minutes at the half-way point of the race, after four of the seven circuits. At that point, the Italian-paced main field increased its speed in order to bring them back. <a href="Aleksandr%20Kuschynski">Aleksandr Kuschynski</a> (Belarus) and <a href="Ruslan%20Pidgornyy">Ruslan Pidgornyy</a> (Ukraine) went clear of the leading group afterward and gained an advantage of a minute and 40 seconds over the Sastre group and 2 minutes, 45 seconds over the main field by the start of the fifth lap over the hilly circuit. The Sastre group was absorbed by the main field at the to go mark, leaving just Kuschynski and Pidgornyy out front. Not long after, shortly before the end of the fifth circuit, <a href="Marcus%20Ljungqvist">Marcus Ljungqvist</a> (Sweden), <a href="Rigoberto%20Ur%C3%A1n">Rigoberto Urán</a> (Colombia) and <a href="Johan%20Van%20Summeren">Johan Van Summeren</a> (Belgium) <a href="Bicycling%20terminology%23attack">attacked</a> from the <a href="peloton">peloton</a> and reeled in Kuschynski and Pidgornyy.

The next attack, one that would later be described as "audacious" and "brave", came from <a href="Christian%20Pfannberger">Christian Pfannberger</a> (Austria), who went free of the main field toward the end of the sixth lap. His maximum advantage never grew to more than a minute, but he did stay away until well into the seventh and final lap, being caught with to go. Within five minutes of fierce attacks, fewer than 20 riders were left in the front group, a group that included <a href="Cadel%20Evans">Cadel Evans</a> (Australia), <a href="Levi%20Leipheimer">Levi Leipheimer</a> (United States), <a href="Santiago%20Botero">Santiago Botero</a> (Colombia), and <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Pineau">Jérôme Pineau</a> (France), with Valverde and Bettini left behind them. Five riders, <a href="Samuel%20S%C3%A1nchez">Samuel Sánchez</a> (Spain), <a href="Michael%20Rogers%20%28cyclist%29">Michael Rogers</a> (Australia), <a href="Davide%20Rebellin">Davide Rebellin</a> (Italy), <a href="Andy%20Schleck">Andy Schleck</a> (Luxembourg), and <a href="Alexandr%20Kolobnev">Alexandr Kolobnev</a> (Russia), came further clear from the group of now 13 due to repeated attacks from Schleck. Sánchez, Rebellin, and Schleck reached the summit of the Badaling climb, with to race, 10 seconds ahead of Rogers and Kolobnev, and 26 seconds ahead of the Evans group. Bettini, Valverde and <a href="Fabian%20Cancellara">Fabian Cancellara</a> (Switzerland) attacked from the main peloton and joined the Evans group at the top of the climb. The leading group's advantage over the two-man chase was 15 seconds with to go.

With left, Cancellara attacked from the Evans group and caught up with the chasers that the group of three had left behind, Kolobnev and Rogers. The three of them successfully bridged the gap to the leaders with about to go, and there were six riders contesting the final sprint. Sánchez won the gold medal, Rebellin the silver, and Cancellara the bronze.

In April 2009, the IOC announced that six athletes had tested positive during the 2008 Summer Olympics, without mentioning names or sports. Later, rumours emerged that the athletes included two cyclists, one of them a medal winner. The <a href="Italian%20National%20Olympic%20Committee">Italian National Olympic Committee</a> (CONI) then confirmed that a male Italian cyclist had tested positive for <a href="Continuous%20erythropoietin%20receptor%20activator">Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator</a> (CERA) during the men's road race, without identifying him. The next day, on 29 April 2009, the Committee confirmed that <a href="Davide%20Rebellin">Davide Rebellin</a> was an involved athlete. Rebellin's agent sent a request for the analysis of the B sample. On 8 July 2009, Rebellin, along with <a href="Stefan%20Schumacher">Stefan Schumacher</a>, were confirmed as having tested positive. Schumacher was already serving a ban after testing positive in the <a href="2008%20Tour%20de%20France">2008 Tour de France</a>, but faces further punishment, and Rebellin subsequently had his medal removed by the UCI and the IOC. On 27 November, Rebellin returned his silver medal to CONI, per their and the UCI's request. Per UCI regulations, Cancellara and Kolobnev were moved up to second and third in the official results, but did not initially receive new medals. On December 18, 2010, Cancellara received the same physical medal initially given to Rebellin, in a ceremony held in his hometown of <a href="Ittigen">Ittigen</a>, Switzerland. The medal originally given to Cancellara will in turn be given to Kolobnev.

Rebellin had appealed at the <a href="Court%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sport">Court of Arbitration for Sport</a> (CAS) against the decision to remove his silver medal, but in July 2010, this was rejected.

There had been controversy in the months before the men's road race when, in the aftermath of doping revelations at the Tour de France, <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> vice-president <a href="Thomas%20Bach">Thomas Bach</a> had suggested that the men's road race's place in the Olympics should be reconsidered, and said that the credibility of the sport had been damaged; although he clarified that there was no immediate threat. Pat McQuaid had reacted angrily to these comments, saying, "Why should they [the majority of cyclists] be threatened because of a few bad apples?"

A total of 142 riders have been qualified in the event at these Games. Most of them are not expected to finish one-day races, having <a href="Glossary%20of%20bicycling%23W">worked</a> in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he would be forced to stop.

Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's individual road race

The women's road race was one of the <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">cycling events</a> at the <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">2008 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a>, China. It took place on 10 August 2008, featuring 66 women from 33 countries. It was the seventh appearance of an Olympic women's road race event and featured a longer course than any of the previous six races. The race was run on the <a href="Urban%20Road%20Cycling%20Course">Urban Road Cycling Course</a> (one of Beijing's nine temporary <a href="Venues%20of%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">venues</a>), which is total. Including a second lap around the final circuit, the total distance of the women's race was , less than half the length of the men's race.

Heavy rain during most of the race made conditions difficult for the competitors. A group of five broke away during the final lap and worked together until the final sprint, where <a href="Nicole%20Cooke">Nicole Cooke</a> won the race. Cooke earned <a href="Great%20Britain%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">Great Britain</a>'s first medal at these Games and 200th Olympic gold medal overall. <a href="Emma%20Johansson">Emma Johansson</a> of <a href="Sweden%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">Sweden</a> and <a href="Tatiana%20Guderzo">Tatiana Guderzo</a> of <a href="Italy%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">Italy</a>, finishing second and third place with the same time as Cooke, received silver and bronze medals respectively.

The race marked the first positive drug test of the 2008 Olympic Games, by <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Isabel%20Moreno">María Isabel Moreno</a> of <a href="Spain%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">Spain</a>. She was scheduled to compete in this event and the time trial to follow, but left Beijing on 31 July, before the race. The International Olympic Committee said on 11 August that she had tested positive for <a href="Erythropoietin">EPO</a>. This left 66 cyclists to compete, one fewer than in <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20road%20race">2004</a>.

The <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">2008 Summer Olympics</a> marked the seventh appearance of an Olympic women's road race event. Qualification for the race was restricted to three athletes per <a href="National%20Olympic%20Committee">National Olympic Committee</a> (NOC) for the 16 top-ranked countries in overall <a href="Union%20Cycliste%20Internationale">Union Cycliste Internationale</a> (UCI) standings at 1 June 2008, and a maximum of two athletes each for the countries ranking 17–24. An NOC with an athlete in the top 100 at 31 May 2008 received a place, which was taken from the countries ranked 17–24 in reversed order, provided that these athletes qualified through the UCI <a href="2008%20UCI%20Women%27s%20Road%20World%20Cup">World Tour rankings</a>. Additionally, three places were available at the <a href="UCI%20B%20World%20Championship%20Cycling">B World Championship</a> for NOCs that did not qualify through the UCI standing; <a href="Gu%20Sun-Geun">Gu Sun-Geun</a>, <a href="Hae%20Ok-Jeong">Hae Ok-Jeong</a> and <a href="Thatsani%20Wichana">Thatsani Wichana</a> secured Olympic qualification for their NOCs in this way, but only the first was chosen by her national committee to compete. The maximum quota of the event was set at 67 cyclists, and as of 5 June, 66 cyclists were qualified in this way. Although the Chinese and Austrian NOCs were allowed to enter three cyclists, they only entered two. This left three open positions: two were allotted to <a href="South%20Africa%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">South Africa</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">New Zealand</a>, based on their World Tour rankings, and the third was given to <a href="Mauritius%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">Mauritius</a> by direct invitation. Only 66 of the 67 entrants began the race, as <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Isabel%20Moreno">María Isabel Moreno</a> of Spain left the country days earlier after failing a drug test.

<a href="Judith%20Arndt">Judith Arndt</a>, the <a href="Germany%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">German</a> rider who finished second at the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a>, was a strong favourite. Arndt had recently finished first at the 2008 <a href="Coupe%20du%20Monde%20Cycliste%20F%C3%A9minine%20de%20Montr%C3%A9al">Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal</a>, and her form in the months that preceded the race was excellent. Among other contenders were UCI Women's Road standings leader, <a href="Marianne%20Vos">Marianne Vos</a> of the <a href="Netherlands%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">Netherlands</a>; Briton <a href="Nicole%20Cooke">Nicole Cooke</a>, who said she had greater confidence in her team on this occasion than in 2004, when she finished fifth; and <a href="Noemi%20Cantele">Noemi Cantele</a> of Italy. The <a href="Australia%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">Australian team</a> was considered strong: it included <a href="Sara%20Carrigan">Sara Carrigan</a> (the defending champion), <a href="Oenone%20Wood">Oenone Wood</a> (winner of the 2008 Australian Road Race), and <a href="Katherine%20Bates">Katherine Bates</a>, all of whom could <a href="Glossary%20of%20cycling%23work">work</a> on each other's behalf. Because the final leg of the course involved steep ramps, riders considered to be climbing experts (including Cooke, Vos, and <a href="Susanne%20Ljungskog">Susanne Ljungskog</a>) were favoured.
Although not seen as a strong medal contender, one former champion participating in the race was 49-year-old <a href="Jeannie%20Longo">Jeannie Longo</a> from <a href="France%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics">France</a>, who won the road race in 1996 and had competed in the <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%201984%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20individual%20road%20race">inaugural event in 1984</a>, making this her seventh appearance.

Many cyclists expected tropical conditions during the race and adjusted their training to compensate. For example, Marianne Vos prepared in <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>. Cyclists had also anticipated a problem with high levels of pollution in Beijing, but these did not appear to affect the results of the men's road race. Although the pollution levels in Beijing on 10 August far exceeded the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>'s safety level, the rain during the women's race decreased the smog level.

In the men's race, conducted the previous day, humidity and heat had taken the greatest toll on the athletes. To compensate for the expected warm weather, some female cyclists chose not to wear undershirts. This proved to be a misjudgment, as conditions were cooler in the <a href="Great%20Wall%20of%20China">Great Wall</a> section than on the previous day— compared to . Thunderstorms, bringing persistently heavy rain and strong winds, resulted in actual race conditions far different from expected. Other riders, such as <a href="Katherine%20Bates">Katherine Bates</a> (who did not finish), prepared by wearing <a href="cooling%20vest">cooling vest</a>s before the race and stocked up on ice packs during it.

The race was run on the <a href="Urban%20Road%20Cycling%20Course">Urban Road Cycling Course</a> (one of Beijing's nine temporary <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics%20venues">venues</a>), which was in its entirety. Unlike the previous Olympic races, the start and finish were not at the same location. The early section of the race took place within central Beijing; the gradient of this part of the race was relatively flat. After approximately , the riders reached the <a href="Badaling">Badaling</a> section of the Great Wall and began two loops of between the Badaling and <a href="Juyongguan">Juyong</a> Passes. The gradient increased at this point, as the Badaling Pass gained in elevation from the start of the circuit to the highest point, including ramps as steep as a 10 percent gradient. From there the cyclists rode over a false flat before descending a highway towards the Juyong Pass. The final were a moderately steep climb, designed to ensure an exciting finale should several riders be grouped together at the end of the race. In total, the distance of the women's race was , less than half the length of the men's race.

The race's starting line was at the <a href="Yongdingmen">Yongdingmen</a> Gate, a remnant of Beijing's <a href="Chinese%20city%20wall">old city wall</a>, which is a part of the <a href="Chongwen%20District">Chongwen District</a> of northern Beijing. The route passed through eight districts: Chongwen, <a href="Xuanwu%20District%2C%20Beijing">Xuanwu</a>, <a href="Dongcheng%20District%2C%20Beijing">Dongcheng</a>, <a href="Xicheng%20District">Xicheng</a>, <a href="Chaoyang%20District%2C%20Beijing">Chaoyang</a>, <a href="Haidian%20District">Haidian</a>, <a href="Changping%20District">Changping</a>, and <a href="Yanqing%20County">Yanqing</a>. Landmarks such as the <a href="Temple%20of%20Heaven">Temple of Heaven</a>, the <a href="Great%20Hall%20of%20the%20People">Great Hall of the People</a>, <a href="Tiananmen%20Square">Tiananmen Square</a>, the <a href="Yonghe%20Temple">Yonghe Temple</a>, and sections of the <a href="Great%20Wall%20of%20China">Great Wall of China</a> were passed as the course journeyed from urban Beijing into the countryside. It passed the architectural features of the 2008 Olympics, including the <a href="Beijing%20National%20Stadium">Beijing National Stadium</a> and <a href="Beijing%20National%20Aquatics%20Center">Beijing National Aquatics Center</a> (known colloquially as the Bird's Nest and the Water Cube). The course ended at the Juyong Pass in the Changping District. The course's scenery was described by "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" as "visually sumptuous".

Due to security regulations put in place by the Olympic organisers, spectators were not permitted to stand roadside along the course. Several prominent figures in cycling protested against this decision, including UCI president <a href="Pat%20McQuaid">Pat McQuaid</a> and two Australian riders, <a href="Stuart%20O%27Grady">Stuart O'Grady</a> and <a href="Cadel%20Evans">Cadel Evans</a>, who competed in the men's race. McQuaid and O'Grady felt that the absence of people along the course deprived the race of the atmosphere present at other cycling events, and said that it failed to take supporters' wishes into consideration. <a href="Cycling%20Australia">Cycling Australia</a>'s reaction to the cyclists' complaints was to request that security restrictions be eased for the <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%202008%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20time%20trial">time trial</a> to follow, but this plea was ignored.

The race started at 14:00 <a href="China%20Standard%20Time">China Standard Time</a> (<a href="UTC%2B8">UTC+8</a>), and was scheduled to last until 17:30. The weather was unseasonably cool. It was cloudy and the roads were dry at the start of the race. The clouds brought steady rainfall midway through the race, making conditions challenging.

The race saw some incidents which caused riders to lose valuable time. <a href="Gu%20Sun-Geun">Gu Sun-Geun</a> (South Korea) lost control of her bike, bringing others down with her. She eventually fell into a concrete ditch on the side of the highway. <a href="Natalia%20Boyarskaya">Natalia Boyarskaya</a> (Russia), who had built a lead of 59 seconds over the top of Badaling, had to stop to see which way to choose at a poorly marked intersection.

The chase for Boyarskaya was led by <a href="Christine%20Thorburn">Christine Thorburn</a> (United States), who brought the lead down to 34 seconds prior to the final loop of . <a href="Emma%20Pooley">Emma Pooley</a> (Great Britain) and Tatiana Guderzo (Italy) rode away from the bunch on the climb and caught Boyarskaya with to go, forming a three rider breakaway. The German team, with a steady pace, caught them soon after. Guderzo attacked with about to go over the final summit. She was soon joined by <a href="Christiane%20Soeder">Christiane Soeder</a> (Austria), Emma Johansson (Sweden), Nicole Cooke (Great Britain) and <a href="Linda%20Villumsen">Linda Villumsen</a> (Denmark). With remaining, the group had gained 16 seconds on the main <a href="peloton">peloton</a>. <a href="Marianne%20Vos">Marianne Vos</a> (Netherlands), one of the pre-race favourites who was not in the leading group, hesitated before leading the chase together with other pre-race favourite Judith Arndt. Cooke looked out of contention as the five came round the final bend, but she came around the other riders with to go, claiming the gold medal with a clear margin. Johansson came in second and Guderzo won the bronze. Vos eventually led the bunch over the finish line, 21 seconds after the winner.

It was later revealed that Cooke had held back intentionally, as she was using lightweight tyres not suited to rainy conditions. The British women's road team manager <a href="Julian%20Winn">Julian Winn</a> said "We were afraid someone might come down in front of her, so we told her to keep to the left. We knew she would chew them up after that." Cooke's victory was the result of meticulous planning, as the team had ridden the course before the race and formulated the winning plan.

The day after the race, an <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC) spokesperson announced that Spanish rider <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Isabel%20Moreno">María Isabel Moreno</a> had become the first athlete of the 2008 Olympics to test positive for a banned substance.
Moreno had provided a <a href="urine%20sample">urine sample</a> the day she arrived in Beijing (31 July), but flew back to <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> on the same day, after suffering a <a href="panic%20attack">panic attack</a>, and did not return to take part in the race. The urine sample tested positive for <a href="erythropoietin">erythropoietin</a> (EPO). The IOC stripped Moreno of her Games accreditation, later referring the matter to the UCI which confirmed the positive result. A statement on Moreno's website read that "she does not feel ready to justify or explain her reasons for leaving the [Olympic] village".

A total of 66 cyclists have been qualified in the event at these Games. Most of them are not expected to finish one-day races, having <a href="Bicycling%20terminology%23work">worked</a> in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Additionally, any rider lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit would be forced to stop, although this situation did not occur.
The notation "s.t." indicates that the rider crossed the finish line in the same group as the cyclist before her, and was therefore credited with the same finishing time.

History of a Six Weeks' Tour

History of a Six Weeks' Tour through a part of France, Switzerland, Germany, and Holland; with Letters Descriptive of a Sail Round the Lake of Geneva and of the Glaciers of Chamouni is a <a href="travel%20literature">travel narrative</a> by the English <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> authors <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a> and <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>. Published in 1817, it describes two trips taken by Mary, Percy, and Mary's stepsister, <a href="Claire%20Clairmont">Claire Clairmont</a>: one across Europe in 1814, and one to <a href="Lake%20Geneva">Lake Geneva</a> in 1816. Divided into three sections, the text consists of a journal, four letters, and Percy Shelley's poem "<a href="Mont%20Blanc%20%28poem%29">Mont Blanc</a>". Apart from the poem, the text was primarily written and organised by Mary Shelley. In 1840 she revised the journal and the letters, republishing them in a collection of Percy Shelley's writings.

Part of the new <a href="genre">genre</a> of the Romantic travel narrative, "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" exudes spontaneity and enthusiasm; the authors demonstrate their desire to develop a sense of taste and distinguish themselves from those around them. The <a href="romance%20%28heroic%20literature%29">romantic elements</a> of the work would have hinted at the text's <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a> politics to nineteenth-century readers. However, the text's frank discussion of politics, including positive references to the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and praise of <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> philosopher <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, was unusual for a travel narrative at the time, particularly one authored primarily by a woman.

Although it sold poorly, "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" received favourable reviews. In proposing another travel narrative to her publisher in 1843, Mary Shelley claimed "my 6 weeks tour brought me many compliments".

Mary Godwin and Percy Shelley met and fell in love in 1814. Percy Shelley initially visited the Godwin household because he was interested in meeting his philosophical hero, Mary's father, <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>. However, Mary and Percy soon began having secret rendezvous, despite the fact that Percy was already married. To Mary's dismay, her father disapproved of their extramarital affair and tried to thwart the relationship. On 28 July 1814, Mary and Percy secretly left for France, taking Mary's stepsister, <a href="Claire%20Clairmont">Claire Clairmont</a>, with them.

The trio travelled for six weeks, from 28 July to 13 September 1814, through France, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, Germany, and the Netherlands (which is referred to as "Holland"); however, they were forced to return to England due to financial considerations. The situation upon their return was fraught with complications: Mary had become pregnant with a child who would soon die, she and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine surprise, her father refused to have anything to do with her.

In May 1816, Mary Godwin, Percy Shelley, and their second child travelled to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> with Claire Clairmont. They spent the summer months with the <a href="Romantic%20poetry">Romantic poet</a> <a href="George%20Gordon%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>, but, as Mary Shelley later wrote of <a href="the%20year%20without%20a%20summer">the year without a summer</a>, "[i]t proved a wet, ungenial summer and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house". The group spent their time writing, boating on <a href="Lake%20Geneva">Lake Geneva</a>, and talking late into the night. Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company also amused themselves by reading German ghost stories, prompting Byron to suggest they each write their own supernatural tale. Mary Godwin began writing what she assumed would be a short story, but with Percy Shelley's encouragement and collaboration, she expanded this tale into her first novel, <a href="Frankenstein">"Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus"</a>.

Mary, Percy, and Claire returned to England in September and on 30 December 1816 Percy and Mary married (two weeks after the death of Percy's first wife), healing the family rift. In March 1817, the Shelleys and Claire moved to <a href="Marlow%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Marlow, Buckinghamshire</a>. At Marlow, they entertained friends, worked hard at their writing, and often discussed politics. Early in the summer of 1817, Mary Shelley finished "Frankenstein", which was published anonymously in January 1818. She also began work on "History of a Six Weeks' Tour", which was published in November 1817.

In the summer of 1817, Mary Shelley started to assemble the couple's joint diary from their 1814 journey into a travel book. At what point she decided to include the letters from the 1816 Geneva trip and Percy Shelley's poem "<a href="Mont%20Blanc%20%28poem%29">Mont Blanc</a>" is unclear, but by 28 September the journal and the letters were a single text. By the middle of October she was making fair copies for the press and correcting and transcribing "Frankenstein" for publication while Percy was working on "<a href="The%20Revolt%20of%20Islam">The Revolt of Islam</a>". Percy probably corrected and copyedited the journal section while Mary did the same for his letters. Advertisements for the work appeared on 30 October in the "<a href="Morning%20Chronicle">Morning Chronicle</a>" and on 1 November in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", promising a 6 November release. However, the work was not actually published until 12 and 13 November. It was Mary Shelley's first published work.

"History of a Six Weeks' Tour" begins with a "Preface", written by Percy Shelley, followed by the journal section. The journal consists of edited entries from the joint diary that Percy and Mary Shelley kept during their 1814 trip to the Continent, specifically those from 28 July to 13 September 1814. Of the 8,500 words in the journal section, 1,150 are from Percy's entries and either copied verbatim or only slightly paraphrased. Almost all of the passages describing the <a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> are in Percy's words. When Mary turned to her own entries, however, she significantly revised them; according to Jeanne Moskal, the editor of the recent definitive edition of the "Tour", "almost nothing of her original phrasing remains". She even included sections of Claire Clairmont's journal.

The second section of the text consists of four "Letters written during a Residence of Three Months in the Environs of Geneva, in the Summer of the Year 1816". The first two letters are signed "M" and the second two "S". The first two are attributed to Mary Shelley, but their origin is obscure. As Moskal writes, "the obvious inference is that they are literary versions of lost private epistles to <a href="Fanny%20Imlay">Fanny Godwin</a>", Mary Shelley's stepsister who remained in England and with whom she corresponded during the journey. However, Moskal also notes that there is a missing Mary Shelley notebook from precisely this time, from which the material in these letters could have come: "It is extremely likely that this notebook contained the same kind of mix of entries made by both Shelleys that the surviving first (July 1814 – May 1815) and second (July 1816 – June 1819) journal notebooks exhibit...Furthermore, Letter I contains four short passages found almost verbatim in P. B. Shelley's letter of 15 May to <a href="Thomas%20Love%20Peacock">T. L. Peacock</a>." The third and fourth letters are composites of Mary's journal entry for 21 July and one of Percy's letters to Peacock.

The third section of the text consists only of Percy's poem "Mont Blanc. Lines written in the vale of Chamouni"; it was the first and only publication of the poem in his lifetime. It has been argued by leading Percy Shelley scholar Donald Reiman that the "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" is arranged so as to lead up to "Mont Blanc". However, those who see the work as primarily a <a href="picturesque">picturesque</a> travel narrative argue that the descriptions of Alpine scenes would have been familiar to early nineteenth-century audiences and they would not have expected a poetic climax.

In 1839, "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" was revised and republished as "Journal of a Six Weeks’ Tour" and "Letters from Geneva" in "Essays, Letters from Abroad, Translations and Fragments, by Percy Bysshe Shelley, Edited by Mrs. Shelley" (1840). Although these works were not by her husband, she decided to include them because they were "part of his life", as she explained to her friend <a href="James%20Henry%20Leigh%20Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a>. She appended her initials to the works to indicate her authorship. As Moskal explains, "the unity of the 1817 volume as a volume was dissolved" to make way for a biography of Percy Shelley. After Percy Shelley drowned in 1822, his father forbade Mary Shelley from writing a memoir or biography of the poet. She therefore added significant biographical notices to the edited collections of his works. The 1840 version of "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" has four major types of changes according to Moskal: "(i) modernization and correction of spelling, punctuation and French (ii) self-distancing from the familial relationship with Claire Clairmont (iii) a heightened sensitivity to national identity (iv) presentation of the travelers as a writing, as well as reading, circle". As a result of these changes, more of Percy Shelley’s writing was included in the 1840 version than in the 1817 version. In 1845, Mary Shelley published a one-volume edition with additional minor changes, based on the 1840 version.
"History of a Six Weeks' Tour" consists of three major sections: a journal, letters from Geneva, and the poem "Mont Blanc". It begins with a short preface, which claims "nothing can be more unpresuming than this little volume" and makes it clear that the couple in the narrative is married (although Mary and Percy were not at the time).

The journal, which switches between the <a href="First-person%20narrative">first-person singular and plural</a> but never identifies its narrators, describes Percy, Mary, and Claire's 1814 six-week tour across the Continent. It is divided by country: France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. After the group arrives in <a href="Calais">Calais</a> and proceeds to Paris, they decide on a plan: "After talking over and rejecting many plans, we fixed on one eccentric enough, but which, from its romance, was very pleasing to us. In England we could not have put it in execution without sustaining continual insult and impertinence: the French are far more tolerant of the vagaries of their neighbours. We resolved to walk through France". Each day they enter a new town; but even while travelling, they spend time writing and reading. The journal comments on the people they meet, the countryside, and the current events that have shaped the environment. Some of what they see is beautiful and some is "barren and wretched". Percy sprains his ankle, which becomes an increasing problem—the group is forced to hire a carriage. By the time the trio reaches <a href="Lucerne">Lucerne</a>, they are nearly out of money and decide to return home. They return by boat along the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>, the cheapest mode of travel. Despite problems with unreliable boats and dangerous waters, they see some beautiful scenery before landing in England.

The four "Letters from Geneva" cover the period between May and July 1816, which the Shelleys spent at Lake Geneva and switch between the singular and plural first-person. Letters I, II, and IV describe the <a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> aspects of <a href="Mont%20Blanc">Mont Blanc</a>, the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>, Lake Geneva, and the glaciers around <a href="Chamonix">Chamonix</a>:

Letter III describes a tour around the environs of <a href="Vevey">Vevey</a> and other places associated with the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> philosopher <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>: "This journey has been on every account delightful, but most especially, because then I first knew the divine beauty of Rousseau's imagination, as it exhibits itself in <a href="Julie%2C%20or%20the%20New%20Heloise">Julie</a>."

"Mont Blanc" compares the sublime aspect of the mountain to the human imagination:

While emphasising the ability of the human imagination to uncover truth through a study of nature, the poem also questions religious certainty. However, according to the poem only a privileged few are able to see nature as it truly is and reveal its secrets to the world.

"History of a Six Weeks’ Tour" is a <a href="travel%20literature">travel narrative</a>, part of a literary tradition begun in the seventeenth century. Through the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, Continental travel was considered educational: young, aristocratic gentlemen completed their studies by learning European languages abroad and visiting foreign courts. In the early seventeenth century, however, the emphasis shifted from <a href="classics">classical learning</a> to empirical experience, such as knowledge of <a href="topography">topography</a>, history, and culture. Detailed travel books, including personal travel narratives, began to be published and became popular in the eighteenth century: over 1,000 individual travel narratives and travel miscellanies were published between 1660 and 1800. The <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a> that was driving the <a href="scientific%20revolution">scientific revolution</a> spread to travel literature; for example, <a href="Lady%20Mary%20Wortley%20Montagu">Lady Mary Wortley Montagu</a> included information she learned in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> regarding <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> inoculation in her travel letters. By 1742, critic and essayist <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> was recommending that travellers engage in "a moral and ethical study of men and manners" in addition to a scientific study of topography and geography.

Over the course of the eighteenth century, the <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a> became increasingly popular; travel to the Continent for Britain's elite was not only educational but also nationalistic. All aristocratic gentlemen took similar trips and visited similar sites, often devoted to developing an appreciation of Britain from abroad. The Grand Tour was celebrated as educational travel when it involved exchanging scientific information with the intellectual elite, learning about other cultures, and preparing oneself to lead. However, it was condemned as trivial when the tourist simply purchased <a href="curio%20%28furniture%29">curio</a> collectibles, acquired a "superficial social polish", and pursued fleeting sexual relationships. During the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the Continent was closed to British travellers and the Grand Tour came under increasing criticism, particularly from <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radicals</a> such as William Godwin who scorned its aristocratic connections. Young Romantic writers criticised its lack of spontaneity; they celebrated <a href="Anne%20Louise%20Germaine%20de%20Sta%C3%ABl">Madame de Staёl's</a> novel "<a href="Corinne%20%28novel%29">Corinne</a>" (1807), which depicts proper travel as "immediate, sensitive, and above all [an] enthusiastic experience".

A new form of travel emerged—Romantic travel—which focused on developing "taste", rather than acquiring objects, and having "enthusiastic experiences". "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" embodies this new style of travel. It is a specifically Romantic travel narrative because of its enthusiasm and the writers' desire to develop a sense of "taste". The travellers are open to new experiences, changing their itinerary frequently and using whatever vehicles they can find. For example, at one point in the journal, Mary Shelley muses:

Not everything she encounters is beautiful, however, and she juxtaposes her distaste for the German working class with her delight with French servants. Although politically liberal, Mary Shelley is aesthetically repelled by the Germans and therefore excludes them. Unlike the non-discriminating Claire Clairmont, Shelley feels free to make judgments of the scenes around her; Shelley writes that Claire "on looking at this scene...exclaimed, 'Oh! this is beautiful enough; let us live here.' This was her exclamation on every new scene, and as each surpassed the one before, she cried, 'I am glad we did not stay at Charenton, but let us live here'". Shelley also compares herself positively to the French peasants who are unaware that Napoleon has been deposed. As scholar Angela Jones contends, "Shelley may be said to figure herself as a more knowledgeable, disinterested English outsider capable of rendering impartial judgment"—an <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> value.

However, as Romanticist Jacqueline Labbe argues, Mary Shelley challenges the conventions of the Romantic travel narrative as well. For example, one reviewer wrote, "now and then a French phrase drops sweetly enough from [the author's] fair mouth", and as Labbe explains, these phrases are supposed to lead the reader to imagine a "beautiful heroine and her group passing easily from village to village". However, both French quotations in "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" undercut this Romantic image. The first describes the overturning of a boat and the drowning of its occupants; the second is a warning not to travel on foot through France, as Napoleon's army has just been disbanded and the women are in danger of rape.

While the overarching generic category for "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" is that of the travel narrative, its individual sections can be considered separately. The first journey is told as a "continuous, undated diary entry" while the second journey is told through epistolary and <a href="lyric%20poetry">lyric</a> forms. Moskal agrees with Reiman that the book was constructed to culminate in "Mont Blanc" and she notes that this was accomplished using a traditional hierarchy of genres—diary, letters, poem—a hierarchy that is gendered as Mary Shelley's writings are superseded by Percy's. However, these traditional gender-genre associations are undercut by the implicit acknowledgment of Mary Shelley as the primary author, with her journal giving the entire work its name and contributing the bulk of the text.
The journal is also threaded through with elements of the <a href="romance%20%28heroic%20literature%29">medieval and Gothic romance tradition</a>: "accounts of ruined castles, enchanting valleys, and sublime views". In fact, in "The English in Italy", Mary Shelley writes of the journey that "it was acting in a novel, being an incarnate romance". However, these romantic descriptions are often ambiguous. Often single sentences contain juxtapositions between "romance" and "reality": "Many villages, ruined by war, occupied the most romantic spots". She also references <a href="Don%20Quixote">Don Quixote</a>, but he was "famous for his "delusions" of romance", as Labbe points out. Mary Shelley's allusions to <a href="Miguel%20de%20Cervantes">Cervantes's</a> "Don Quixote" (1605) not only places her text in a romance tradition, they would also have hinted at its <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radicalism</a> to contemporary readers. During the 1790s, Mary Shelley's father, William Godwin, connected his support for the French Revolution with the romance tradition, specifically "Don Quixote" and any allusion to the novel would have signalled Godwinian radicalism to readers at the time. It would also have suggested support for reform efforts in Spain, which was rebelling against Napoleon. The beginning of the journal is dominated by romance conventions, but this style disappears when the travellers run out of money. However, romance conventions briefly return during the trip down the Rhine. As Labbe argues, "it would appear that while [Shelley] seems to be industriously salting her narrative with romance in order, perhaps, to garner public approval, she also ... exposes the falsity of such a scheme."

One of the most important influences on "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" was "<a href="Letters%20Written%20in%20Sweden%2C%20Norway%2C%20and%20Denmark">Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</a>" (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>. A travel narrative that reflects on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's personal feelings, it provided a model for Mary Shelley's work. Like her mother, Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political tone was unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women writers. Like Wollstonecraft's "Letters", "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" blurs the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the <a href="picturesque">picturesque</a>.

"History of a Six Weeks' Tour" is part of a liberal reaction to recent history: its trajectory begins with a survey of the devastation of the Napoleonic Wars and ends by celebrating the <a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> in nature. <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>'s 1850 "<a href="The%20Prelude">The Prelude</a>" and the third canto of Byron's "<a href="Childe%20Harold%27s%20Pilgrimage">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</a>" follow a similar course. As Moskal explains, "nature is troped as the repository of a sublimity, once incarnated in Napoleon, that will re-emerge in politics". The book is therefore not only a liberal political statement but also a Romantic celebration of nature.

The journal begins with, as Moskal describes, a "view of Napoleon's shattered political power". He had just been exiled to <a href="Elba">Elba</a> a few months before the Shelleys arrived in Europe. Surveying the devastation caused by the Napoleonic Wars, Mary Shelley worries about how the British will handle Paris and grieves over the "ruin" brought to the small French town of <a href="Nogent-sur-Marne">Nogent</a> by the <a href="Cossacks">Cossacks</a>. Between the two journeys recorded in the text, Napoleon returned to power in the so-called <a href="Hundred%20Days">Hundred Days</a> and was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> in 1815. The four letters from Geneva reflect obliquely on this event. As Moskal argues, "the Shelleys focus on the forms of sublimity and power that outlast Napoleon: the literary genius of Rousseau and the natural sublimity of Lake Geneva and Mont Blanc". Both Shelleys use their works in "History of a Six Weeks’ Tour" to assess and evaluate the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, making it a highly political travel narrative. In Letter II, Mary Shelley writes:

Mary Shelley also includes positive portrayals of the French people. As Mary Shelley scholar <a href="Betty%20T.%20Bennett">Betty T. Bennett</a> explains, "politically pointed, these accolades underscore the link between the 1814 defeated enemy of Britain and the pre-Napoleon democratic spirit of the 1789 Revolution, a spirit the Shelleys wished to reactivate".

Lives of people interested Mary Shelley and she recorded them, but she also recorded a great deal of the travellers’ own feelings, suggesting to the reader the appropriate reaction. For example, she wrote of the French town Nogent:

"History of a Six Weeks' Tour" received three major reviews, mostly favourable. However, the book did not sell well. Percy Shelley discovered in April or May 1820 that there were no profits to pay the printer and when <a href="Charles%20Ollier">Charles Ollier</a>, the co-publisher, went out of business in 1823, his inventory included 92 copies of the work. Still, Mary Shelley believed the work was successful, and when she proposed another travel narrative, "<a href="Rambles%20in%20Germany%20and%20Italy">Rambles in Germany and Italy</a>", to publisher <a href="Edward%20Moxon">Edward Moxon</a> in 1843, she wrote "my 6 weeks tour brought me many compliments". Her comments may have been self-interested, however.

The first review of "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" was published by "<a href="The%20Eclectic%20Review">The Eclectic Review</a>" in May 1818, which reviewed the book along with publisher Thomas Hookham's account of a Swiss tour, "A Walk through Switzerland in September 1816". Although both works share the same fascination with Rousseau and his liberal ideas, only Hookham is attacked; as scholar Benjamin Colbert explains, "Shelley tends to remain on more neutral territory", such as the cult of <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a> and the novel "Julie". However, the reviewer questions the authenticity of the work: "To us...the value of the book is considerably lessened by a strong suspicion that the dramatis personae are fictitious, and that the little adventures introduced for the purpose of giving life and interest to the narration, are the mere invention of the Author." He identifies passages that remind him of similar travel narratives by <a href="Patrick%20Brydone">Patrick Brydone</a>, <a href="Ann%20Radcliffe">Ann Radcliffe</a>, and John Carr, effectively identifying the generic tradition in which the Shelleys were writing.

The second and most positive review was published by "<a href="Blackwood%27s%20Magazine">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</a>" in July 1818. The reviewer was most impressed with the journal section, particularly its informality and concision: "the perusal of it rather produces the same effect as a smart walk before breakfast, in company with a lively friend who hates long stories". Covertly comparing the work to <a href="Blue%20Stockings%20Society%20%28England%29">bluestocking</a> <a href="Lady%20Morgan">Lady Morgan</a>'s recent "France" (1817), the reviewer found the female writer of "History of a Six Weeks' Tour" much more favourable: "The writer of this little volume, too, is a Lady, and writes like one, with ease, gracefulness, and vivacity. Above all, there is something truly delightful in the colour of her stockings; they are of the purest white, and much more becoming than the brightest blue." The "<a href="Monthly%20Review%20%28London%29">Monthly Review</a>" published a short review in January 1819; they found the first journey "hurried" but the second one better described.

For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Mary Shelley was known as the author of "Frankenstein" and the wife of famous Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was not until the 1970s, with the rise of <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist literary criticism</a>, that scholars began to pay attention to her other works. In fact, with the exception of "Frankenstein" and "<a href="The%20Last%20Man">The Last Man</a>", until the 1990s almost all of Mary Shelley's writings had gone out of print or only been available in expensive, scholarly editions. It was not until the publication of scholarship by <a href="Mary%20Poovey">Mary Poovey</a> and <a href="Anne%20K.%20Mellor">Anne K. Mellor</a> in the 1980s that Mary Shelley's "other" works—her short stories, essays, reviews, dramas, biographies, travel narratives, and other novels—began to be recognised as literary achievements.

Fez (video game)

Fez (stylized as FEZ) is an <a href="indie%20video%20game">indie</a> <a href="Puzzle-platform%20game">puzzle-platform</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Polytron%20Corporation">Polytron Corporation</a> and published by <a href="Trapdoor%20%28company%29">Trapdoor</a>. The <a href="player-character">player-character</a> Gomez receives a <a href="fez">fez</a> that reveals his <a href="two-dimensional">two-dimensional</a> (2D) world to be one of four sides of a <a href="three-dimensional">three-dimensional</a> (3D) world. The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments to restore order to the universe.

The game was called an "underdog darling of the indie game scene" during its high-profile and protracted <a href="Development%20of%20Fez">five-year development cycle</a>. "Fez" designer and Polytron founder <a href="Phil%20Fish">Phil Fish</a> gained celebrity status for his outspoken public persona and his prominence in the 2012 documentary "", which detailed "Fez" final stages of development and Polytron's related legal issues. "Fez" met critical acclaim upon its April 2012 release for <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a>. The game was <a href="Porting%23Porting%20in%20gaming">ported</a> to other platforms following the expiration of a yearlong exclusivity agreement.

Reviewers commended the game's emphasis on discovery and freedom, but criticized its technical issues, in-game navigation, and endgame backtracking. They likened the game's rotation mechanic to the 2D–3D shifts of "<a href="Echochrome">Echochrome</a>", "<a href="Nebulus%20%28video%20game%29">Nebulus</a>", "<a href="Super%20Paper%20Mario">Super Paper Mario</a>", and "<a href="Crush%20%28video%20game%29">Crush</a>". "Fez" won awards including the <a href="Seumas%20McNally%20Grand%20Prize">Seumas McNally Grand Prize</a> and "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" 2012 <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a>. It had sold one million copies by the end of 2013, and it influenced games such as "<a href="Monument%20Valley%20%28video%20game%29">Monument Valley</a>", "<a href="Crossy%20Road">Crossy Road</a>", and "<a href="Secrets%20of%20R%C3%A6tikon">Secrets of Rætikon</a>". A planned sequel was canceled when Fish abruptly left the indie game industry.

"Fez" is a <a href="two-dimensional">two-dimensional</a> (2D) <a href="puzzle%20platformer">puzzle platform game</a> set in a <a href="three-dimensional">three-dimensional</a> (3D) world. The <a href="player-character">player-character</a> Gomez lives peacefully on a 2D plane until he receives a red <a href="fez">fez</a> and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden <a href="hexahedron">hexahedron</a> that tears the fabric of <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> and reveals a third dimension. After the game appears to <a href="video%20game%20glitch">glitch</a>, <a href="Reset%20%28computing%29">reset</a>, and <a href="Reboot%20%28computing%29">reboot</a>, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation <a href="game%20mechanic">mechanic</a> reveals new paths through the <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> by connecting otherwise inaccessible platforms, and is the basis of "Fez" puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments, which accrete to restore order to the universe. In search of these cubes, Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming elements change with the level themes, including crates that activate switches, bombs that reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne.

The exploratory parts of the game feature a series of arcane codes and glyphs, treasure maps and chests, and secret rooms. Players are left without guidance to determine whether game elements are decipherable subpuzzles or simply <a href="disinformation">false signals</a>. These sorts of puzzles include hidden <a href="warp%20%28gaming%29">warp gates</a>, enigmatic obelisks, invisible platforms, sequences of <a href="tetrominos">tetrominos</a>, a ciphered <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a>, and <a href="QR%20codes">QR codes</a>. One of the game's recurring themes is an ancient civilization that attempted to make sense of their dimensionality, as told through artifacts.

"Fez" has no enemies, bosses, or punishments for failure—the player-character quickly <a href="respawns">respawns</a> upon falling to his death. The game's designer described "Fez" as a stop and smell the flowers' kind of game". It prioritizes puzzle-solving and patience over the platforming genre's traditional interest in dexterity. "Fez" features a <a href="pixel%20art">pixelated art style</a> and a limited <a href="Palette%20%28computing%29">color palette</a> reminiscent of the <a href="8-bit%20era">8-bit era</a>. Its homage includes "<a href="Tetris">Tetris</a>" tetrominos inscribed on the walls and in the sky, "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>" treasure chest animations, "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>" mushroom levels, travel by pipe, and floating platforms. The game's settings include forests, factories, a coastal lighthouse, an urban city, and a library. "Fez" <a href="New%20Game%20Plus">New Game Plus</a> mode adds a first-person perspective feature and lets the player revisit areas to collect "anti-cubes" from harder puzzles. This second half of the game is more challenging and focuses on <a href="code%20cracking">code cracking</a>.

"Fez" five-year development cycle is known for its protracted length and amount of public exposure. Nathan Grayson of "<a href="VG247">VG247</a>" likened its rocky history to "an indie "<a href="Duke%20Nukem%20Forever">Duke Nukem Forever</a>"", and "<a href="Polygon%20%28website%29">Polygon</a>" reviewer Arthur Gies noted its standing reputation as an "<a href="Underdog%20%28term%29">underdog</a> darling of the indie game scene". Its designer, <a href="Phil%20Fish">Phil Fish</a>, became renowned in a way unusual for game developers due to his prominence in the 2012 documentary "". Apart from "Fez", which was released to wide acclaim, Fish himself became known for his outspoken and acerbic public persona.

"Fez" began as a collaboration between Canadian indie developers Fish and Shawn McGrath. They worked on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game in which a 3D space was viewed from four 2D angles. Though their partnership broke down due to creative differences, the entirety of "Fez" design, story, and art descends from this game mechanic. Fish continued to work on the project in his spare time and solicited for a programmer on <a href="DeviantArt">DeviantArt</a>, where he found Renaud Bédard. "Fez" was first announced in July 2007 on "The Independent Gaming Source". It was nominated for two awards at the 2008 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a> <a href="Independent%20Games%20Festival">Independent Games Festival</a> (GDC IGF). When Fish's employer did not permit him time off to attend the awards, he quit. Fish later recalled this moment as "when [he] became indie". The game won "Excellence in Visual Art", and its presence created a surge of public interest in "Fez" that rode a concurrent swell of interest in indie game development as a whole. Fish received a Canadian government loan to open Polytron Corporation as a <a href="startup%20company">startup company</a> and began full-time work on "Fez". In July 2009, Polytron announced that "Fez" would launch in early 2010 as an <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a> exclusive. Development continued with an experimental spirit until the company ran out of money. Fish borrowed from friends and family to keep the company open and considered canceling the project before the nearby Québécois developer-publisher <a href="Trapdoor%20%28company%29">Trapdoor</a> offered to help. Fish felt that the Trapdoor partnership rescued the game.

"Fez" won multiple awards in 2011 and was a "PAX 10" selection at the 2011 <a href="Penny%20Arcade%20Expo">Penny Arcade Expo</a>. Fish is shown preparing for "Fez" booth at <a href="PAX%20East">PAX East</a> 2011, an earlier show, in the 2012 documentary film "Indie Game: The Movie". The film chronicles the game development stories of several indie developers. As a subplot, the film presents Fish amidst a legal dispute with a former business partner that jeopardizes "Fez" future. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" called Fish the film's "most memorable developer", and "<a href="Rock%2C%20Paper%2C%20Shotgun">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a>" wrote that Fish is portrayed as theatrical in a way that exacerbates his already outspoken reputation. "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" said that the part when Fish resolves to kill himself if he does not release his game is "the film's most startling moment". Near the end of "Fez" development, Fish told a "<a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a>" reporter that he had received positive feedback from IGF Chairman <a href="Brandon%20Boyer">Brandon Boyer</a> and "<a href="Braid%20%28video%20game%29">Braid</a>" designer <a href="Jonathan%20Blow">Jonathan Blow</a>, but that he felt "burnt out". The final game included almost none of the original work from the first two years of development. After several delays, "Fez" was submitted for certification in February 2012.

"Fez" was released on April 13, 2012, and sold 200,000 copies during its yearlong exclusivity to the Xbox Live Arcade platform. Fish rebuked Polytron's co-publisher, <a href="Microsoft%20Studios">Microsoft Studios</a>, for botching the game's release by way of lackluster publicity. Several months later, Polytron entered a high-profile dispute with <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> over the cost of <a href="Patch%20%28computing%29">patching</a> "Fez". Nearly a year after "Fez" launch, Fish announced a <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows PC</a> <a href="Porting%23Porting%20in%20gaming">port</a> for release on May 1, 2013. <a href="OS%20X">OS X</a> and <a href="Linux">Linux</a> ports debuted on September 11, 2013, and <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a> ports by <a href="BlitWorks">BlitWorks</a> debuted on March 25, 2014. <a href="Ouya">Ouya</a> and <a href="iOS">iOS</a> ports were also announced; the iOS release began development in April 2017 and was released in December 2017. No <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> release is planned. Bédard stayed to port the Windows release before joining Toronto's <a href="Capybara%20Games">Capybara Games</a>. He credited Polytron's long development cycle to his own inexperience in game development (compounded by the team's small size and difficulty in setting reasonable milestones), the game's scope, and Fish's perfectionism. Fish had hoped that players would discuss "Fez" nuances online after its release. Players collaborated online for a week to solve the final "monolith" puzzle by using a cryptanalytic attack known as <a href="brute-force%20attack">brute force</a>. "<a href="Ars%20Technica">Ars Technica</a>" described the apparent end to "Fez" harder puzzles as "anticlimactic", but Fish told "Eurogamer" in March 2013 that hidden in-game secrets remain to be found.

More than three years after its digital launch, "Fez" received a physical release designed by Fish and limited to a signed edition of 500 in December 2015. The deluxe package included the soundtrack and a stylized red notebook with gold foil inlay. Though Bédard had moved on to another company, he continued to work on the game in secret. In August 2016, he released a final patch for the computer releases of "Fez" that included performance improvements, as a result of a unified codebase under an <a href="Open-source%20software">open source</a> <a href="software%20library">software library</a>, and features such as a <a href="speedrun">speedrun</a> mode.

Bédard wrote "Fez" in <a href="Microsoft%20Visual%20C%20Sharp">Microsoft Visual C# Express</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20XNA">XNA Game Studio Express</a>. He coded the level editor and the <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a>, Trixel, which converts 2D tiles ("triles") into four-sided 3D <a href="voxels">voxels</a> ("trixels"). Fish made 2D pixel art in <a href="Photoshop">Photoshop</a> for each side of the trixel, which Bédard's custom software compiled into 3D game assets. Fish would then design levels in the level editor by <a href="extruding">extruding</a> surfaces, a process he found "overwhelming" but akin to playing with <a href="Lego">Lego</a> blocks. In their workflow, Fish first proposed ideas that Bédard would implement. The two would then discuss and fine-tune the addition—they worked well together.

The game came to adopt <a href="Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> mechanics, with "<a href="secret%20passages">secret passages</a>, warp gates, and <a href="cheat%20codes">cheat codes</a>". Fish cited "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" as an inspiration and compared its open world, nonlinear narrative, and "obtuse metapuzzles" to "Fez" own alphabet, numeric system, and an "almost unfairly hard to get ... second set of collectibles". He was also inspired by the Nintendo Entertainment System games of his youth (particularly those of the "<a href="Super%20Mario%20%28series%29">Super Mario</a>" and "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>" series), <a href="Hayao%20Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>'s signature "open blue sky", "feel-good" atmosphere, and <a href="Fumito%20Ueda">Fumito Ueda</a>'s "<a href="Ico">Ico</a>". Fish sought to emulate "Ico" feeling of nostalgic and isolated loneliness, and Ueda's development philosophy wherein all nonessential game elements are removed ("design by subtraction"). Fish made a personal challenge of designing a game without relying on "established mechanics". As such, "Fez" was always a peaceful game that never contained an antagonist.

Rich Vreeland, also known as <a href="Disasterpeace">Disasterpeace</a>, composed the game's <a href="chiptune">chiptune</a>-esque <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a> soundtrack. Despite his background in chiptune, Vreeland limited his use of that genre's mannerisms in the score. He worked with soft <a href="synth%20pads">synth pads</a> and <a href="reverb">reverb</a> to push the score closer to a 1980s synthesizer sound. He also reduced reliance on percussion and incorporated <a href="distortion">distortion</a> techniques like <a href="bitcrushing">bitcrushing</a> and <a href="Wow%20%28recording%29">wow</a>. Vreeland opted for slower passages with varying tempos that could "ebb, flow, and breathe with the player". He left some portions of "Fez" without music. Vreeland worked on its soundtrack at night for about 14 months while scoring "<a href="Shoot%20Many%20Robots">Shoot Many Robots</a>", and Brandon McCartin of "<a href="Aquaria%20%28video%20game%29">Aquaria</a>" contributed the game's sound effects.

Vreeland's first composition for the game ("Adventure") became the soundtrack's first track. He wrote it after meeting Bédard but before discussing the soundtrack with Fish, and based the composition on "Fez" audio created prior to his arrival. Vreeland wanted to use tape recorders for their distinctive sound, but potential audio synching issues with this method led him to employ digital recording. Portions of the soundtrack dynamically change between several dozen constituent elements and react to the game environment. For example, the "Puzzle" track's elements change <a href="musical%20key">musical key</a> based on the in-game time of day. Certain tracks were intended to imitate real-world sounds, such as those of <a href="bats">bats</a>, <a href="thunderstorms">thunderstorms</a>, <a href="taiko">taiko</a>, and water falling from <a href="stalactites">stalactites</a>. Other tracks expanded from improvisations. Vreeland was also inspired by the "<a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">Lord of the Rings</a>" Shire theme, 1980s horror media, the soundtrack of <a href="demoscene">demoscene</a> game "Jasper's Journeys", the "Legend of Zelda" dungeon music, the <a href="Mass%20Effect%20%28video%20game%29%23Soundtrack">"Mass Effect" soundtrack</a>, <a href="Tangerine%20Dream">Tangerine Dream</a>, and <a href="Steve%20Reich">Steve Reich</a>. "Continuum" is a synthesized rendition of <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Frédéric Chopin</a>'s <a href="Prelude%2C%20Op.%2028%2C%20No.%204%20%28Chopin%29">Prelude, Op. 28, No. 4</a>. Instruments used in recording include the Sonic Charge Synplant, <a href="minimoog">minimoog</a>, "synthetic <a href="flute">flute</a>", and <a href="Boomwhacker">Boomwhacker</a>.

The soundtrack was released in a digital format on April 20, 2012. Pre-orders for the soundtrack topped the <a href="Bandcamp">Bandcamp</a> charts. Kirk Hamilton of "<a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>" wrote that "Fez" sound effects evoked <a href="Jim%20Guthrie%20%28singer-songwriter%29">Jim Guthrie</a>'s "" audio. Janus Kopfstein of "<a href="The%20Verge">The Verge</a>" called the work "fantastic" and described it as a cross between a "1980s <a href="Vangelis">Vangelis</a> synth odyssey" and a submerged vinyl record from an arcade. "Game Informer" Matt Miller wrote that the soundtrack contributed to "Fez" "<a href="80s%20Nostalgia">80s Nostalgia</a> vibe". "Eurogamer" described the music as "lush, spooky, and electrifying", and "Edge" compared it to "<a href="Gustav%20Holst">Holst</a> put through a <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Mega Drive</a>". Oli Welsh of "Eurogamer" wrote that the music matched the game's themes of "hidden depth". Welsh heard influences of 1960s English psychedelia (<a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>, <a href="Soft%20Machine">Soft Machine</a>), 1970s <a href="Krautrock">Krautrock</a> (Tangerine Dream and <a href="Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a>), 1980s synth (<a href="Jean%20Michel%20Jarre">Jean Michel Jarre</a>, Vangelis), and <a href="Erik%20Satie">Erik Satie</a>. He added that the soundtrack's contribution to "Fez" was "incalculable". Damian Kastbauer of "<a href="Game%20Developer%20%28magazine%29">Game Developer</a>" used Vreeland's soundtrack to show that a retrogaming aesthetic in sound and visuals could be both "futuristic and nostalgic" and provide the "right 'voice' to support the game's design intentions".

"<a href="Game%20Developer%20%28magazine%29">Game Developer</a>" listed Vreeland in their 2012 Power 50 for his work on the soundtrack, which they described as "atmospheric, pensive, and maybe even a little bit melancholy". In keeping with "Fez" theme of secrets, images visible only through <a href="spectrogram">spectrogram</a> were embedded into the soundtrack audio. Vreeland released a remix album, "FZ: Side F", a year later on April 20, 2013. It features tracks from other artists, including Jim Guthrie. Vreeland later released another remix album, "FZ: Side Z", and all three albums were included in the August 2013 Game Music Bundle 5.

Reviews upon "Fez" original release were "generally favorable", according to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. Later releases received "universal acclaim". Each release was consistently among the top-rated releases for each platform's year. <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> ranks "Fez" within its top 100 highest-rated Xbox 360 games, top 20 PC games, and top 20 PlayStation 4 games. While in development, "Fez" had won the 2012 GDC Independent Games Festival's <a href="Seumas%20McNally%20Grand%20Prize">Seumas McNally Grand Prize</a>, the 2011 <a href="Indiecade">Indiecade</a> Best in Show and Best Story/World Design, the 2011 <a href="Fantastic%20Fest">Fantastic Arcade</a> Audience Choice Award, and the 2008 GDC Independent Games Festival's Excellence in Visual Art. "Eurogamer" gave "Fez" their highest rating and named the "perfect, wordless <a href="sci-fi">sci-fi</a> <a href="parable">parable</a>" their 2012 Game of the Year. "<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>" listed "Fez" eighth in its Best Games of 2012, ahead of high-budget games like "" and "<a href="Halo%204">Halo 4</a>". "Fez" was chosen as the 2012 game of the year by "<a href="Diamond%20Trust%20of%20London">Diamond Trust of London</a>" developer <a href="Jason%20Rohrer">Jason Rohrer</a> and "Halo 4" lead game designer Scott Warner. The Windows PC port was Metacritic's tenth best-reviewed video game of 2013.

"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called "Fez" Fish's "tribute to 1980s gaming ... lovingly, almost excessively, devoted to the golden age of Nintendo". Arthur Gies of "Polygon" described its aesthetics as "so retro it hurts", citing its <a href="Pixelization">pixelated</a> look, chiptune soundtrack, and ways of clueing the player without explicit guidance. Gies felt that though "8-bit nostalgia" was outmoded, "Fez" showed an understanding of its influences and was the "most authentic" of the style. Jeremy Parish of "<a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>" called the game's minimalism "admirable" and likened its art style to that of "<a href="Cave%20Story">Cave Story</a>". "<a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>" described "Fez" nostalgic manner as "the video game aesthetic". Oli Welsh of "Eurogamer" lamented how "retro pixel art" became an indie game cliché during the game's development, but felt that "Fez" transcended such stereotypes through its dedication to the wonderment of early Nintendo titles. "Fish clearly worships the Nintendo of his boyhood", he wrote. Welsh likened "Fez" to a 1970s, peace-loving, <a href="surrealist">surrealist</a> version of "" as imagined by <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, and foresaw its social status as "the darling of a certain indie clique" with "studied hipster cool". "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" described the game as "a place built from gaming's history", whose playfulness makes it "an unexpected heir to "Super Mario Bros."" with levels like well-crafted toys, and <a href="IGN">IGN</a> video review said the game "drags the 8-bit era into the future".

Journalists likened "Fez" rotation mechanic to the 2D–3D shifts of games like "<a href="Echochrome">Echochrome</a>", "<a href="Super%20Paper%20Mario">Super Paper Mario</a>", and "<a href="Crush%20%28video%20game%29">Crush</a>". Early in development, Fish himself said that the idea is "nothing mind-blowing" and that the game could have been made "at any point in the last 15 years". "Polygon" Gies preferred how "Echochrome" used the perspective mechanic, and Tom McShea of "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" considered "Fez" mechanic a gimmick. Matt Miller of "Game Informer" thought that "Fez" realized the mechanic's potential better than other perspective-shifting games, and further commended "Fez" puzzle design and pacing up until the endgame. Miller also compared its story to that of the novella "<a href="Flatland">Flatland</a>", whose protagonist similarly discovers the complexities of another dimension. "1UP.com" Parish said that "Fez" rotation mechanic was deeper than that of "Super Paper Mario" and not as dependent on <a href="M.%20C.%20Escher">M. C. Escher</a> themes as "Echochrome". "Edge" felt that the mechanic was "far less self-conscious" and "more harmonious" than in "Echochrome" and "Crush". The magazine wrote that "Fez" indoor puzzles were its best. "Eurogamer" Welsh compared the game's "wraparound platforming" to the 1980s game "<a href="Nebulus%20%28video%20game%29">Nebulus</a>" and described the rotation mechanic as among the console generation's "most unusual technical challenges".

Reviewers commended the game's emphasis on discovery and freedom, but found its reliance on backtracking, particularly in the endgame, tedious. Parish of "1UP.com" wrote that open-world action games like "<a href="Metroid%20Prime">Metroid Prime</a>" all have these issues. "Edge" compared "Fez" esoteric tricks to an older age of game development that packed games with <a href="Easter%20egg%20%28video%20games%29">Easter eggs</a>, secrets, and codes, citing titles such as "<a href="Exile%20%281988%20video%20game%29">Exile</a>" and "<a href="Jet%20Set%20Willy">Jet Set Willy</a>". The magazine also came to appreciate the 3D map. IGN's Mitch Dyer contrasted the game's riddles to the "<a href="Metal%20Gear%20Solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>" codec frequency puzzle. Jeffrey Matulef of "Eurogamer" related his experience to the feeling of first playing the 1994 "Myst", and "The New York Times" called "Fez" "a "<a href="Finnegans%20Wake">Finnegans Wake</a>" of video games" for its codebreaking that "makes the player feel like <a href="John%20Forbes%20Nash%2C%20Jr.">John Nash</a> as portrayed by <a href="Russell%20Crowe">Russell Crowe</a> in "<a href="A%20Beautiful%20Mind%20%28film%29">A Beautiful Mind</a>"". "Game Informer" recommended "Fez" for completionists who seek challenges. "Polygon" Gies was uncertain as to whether the game's technical <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a> issues were intentional, and described this dilemma as having a "certain genius". Other reviewers noted its technical faults: "Game Informer" as minor, and "1UP.com" as "easily the glitchiest game I've played on my 360".

"Fez" sold 20,000 copies in its first day, 100,000 in less than two months, 200,000 within a year, and, after the Humble Bundle, one million by the end of 2013. It was Xbox Live's 13th best-selling Arcade title of 2012. "Fez" was cited as an inspiration for 2014 indie games "<a href="Monument%20Valley%20%28video%20game%29">Monument Valley</a>", "<a href="Crossy%20Road">Crossy Road</a>", and "<a href="Secrets%20of%20R%C3%A6tikon">Secrets of Rætikon</a>".

"Fez 2" was announced as "<a href="one%20more%20thing">one more thing</a>" at the end of the June 2013 Horizon indie game press conference, held during the annual <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>. The project was canceled a month later following a Twitter argument between Fish and a <a href="video%20game%20journalism">video game journalist</a>. In an episode of Marcus Beer's "<a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a>" show "<a href="Invisible%20Walls">Invisible Walls</a>", the journalist criticized Fish's response to questions about Microsoft's <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> self-publishing policy change. Fish replied on Twitter with condemnation for the industry's negativity and, in a final tweet, announced both "Fez 2" cancellation and his exit from the industry. The news came as a surprise to the rest of his company, which has not commented on upcoming projects other than ports since the sequel's cancellation. "Polygon" listed Fish in their top 50 newsmakers of 2013 for the social power of his "caustic use of Twitter".

U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Keysers Ridge–Cumberland, Maryland)

U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Alt US 40) is the <a href="U.S.%20Highway">U.S. Highway</a> designation for a former segment of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20in%20Maryland">U.S. Route 40</a> (US 40) through <a href="Garrett%20County%2C%20Maryland">Garrett</a> and <a href="Allegany%20County%2C%20Maryland">Allegany</a> counties in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>. The highway begins at US 40 near exit 14 on <a href="Interstate%2068">Interstate 68</a> (I-68) and runs eastward to <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland</a>, where it ends at exit 44 on I-68. Alt US 40 is maintained by the <a href="Maryland%20State%20Highway%20Administration">Maryland State Highway Administration</a> (MDSHA).

The highway is known as National Pike because it follows the original alignment of the historic <a href="National%20Road">National Road</a>. As a result, there are many historic sites along Alt US 40, including the <a href="Casselman%20Bridge">Casselman Bridge</a> in <a href="Grantsville%2C%20Maryland">Grantsville</a> and the last remaining National Road toll gate house in Maryland, located in <a href="La%20Vale%2C%20Maryland">LaVale</a>.

When the <a href="Interstate%2068">National Freeway</a> was built in western Maryland paralleling the old National Road, parts of US 40 were bypassed. The part of the bypassed road between Keyser's Ridge and Cumberland became Alt US 40, and other bypassed sections east of Cumberland became <a href="Maryland%20Route%20144">Maryland Route 144</a> (MD 144) and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20Scenic">U.S. Route 40 Scenic</a>. Although Alt US 40 has diminished in importance from its original status as the National Road with the construction of I-68, it remains an important route for local traffic and serves as the Main Streets of <a href="Grantsville%2C%20Maryland">Grantsville</a> and <a href="Frostburg%2C%20Maryland">Frostburg</a>.
Alt US 40 runs from <a href="Keysers%20Ridge%2C%20Maryland">Keyser's Ridge</a> to <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland</a>, following part of the route of the <a href="National%20Road">National Road</a> through some of Maryland's most mountainous terrain in <a href="Garrett%20County%2C%20Maryland">Garrett</a> and <a href="Allegany%20County%2C%20Maryland">Allegany</a> counties. The highway is a part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a> as a principal arterial from the eastern junction with MD 36 in Frostburg to the intersection of Mechanic Street and Henderson Avenue in Cumberland.

Alt US 40 branches from <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20in%20Maryland">US 40</a> near exit 14 on <a href="Interstate%2068">I-68</a> at <a href="Keysers%20Ridge%2C%20Maryland">Keysers Ridge</a>. It runs parallel to I-68 through northern Garrett County as a two-lane road with truck lanes on some uphill sections. The <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT)—that is, the number of cars that use the road per day, averaged over the course of one year—is 1,831 at the western end of Alt US 40. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 has an AADT of 14,271. Alt US 40 passes through some of the most mountainous terrain in Maryland. The route runs perpendicular to the mountain ridges in Garrett County, and as a result much of the section of the road in Garrett County runs uphill or downhill. The first mountain encountered by the highway east of Keysers Ridge is <a href="Negro%20Mountain">Negro Mountain</a>. The road passes over the mountain at an elevation of , which is the highest point on Alt US 40, and was also the highest point along the <a href="National%20Road">National Road</a>. East of Negro Mountain, the highway enters <a href="Grantsville%2C%20Maryland">Grantsville</a>, where traffic increases, with the AADT increasing to 3,711, the highest traffic density on Alt US 40 in Garrett County. In Grantsville, Alt US 40 meets <a href="Maryland%20Route%20669">MD 669</a>, which connects with <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%20669">Pennsylvania Route 669</a> toward <a href="Salisbury%2C%20Pennsylvania">Salisbury, Pennsylvania</a>. A short distance east of this intersection, the highway meets <a href="Maryland%20Route%20495">MD 495</a>, which junctions with I-68 and continues southward toward <a href="Oakland%2C%20Maryland">Oakland</a>. East of Grantsville, Alt US 40 passes over the <a href="Casselman%20River">Casselman River</a> on a steel bridge built in 1933. Downstream from this bridge is the <a href="Casselman%20River%20Bridge%20State%20Park">Casselman River Bridge State Park</a>, centered on the stone arch bridge which originally carried the <a href="National%20Road">National Road</a> over the Casselman River.

Continuing eastward from Grantsville, Alt US 40 intersects <a href="U.S.%20Route%20219%20in%20Maryland">US  219</a> a short distance north of exit 22 on I-68, where US 219 leaves the freeway. East of this intersection, traffic decreases, with an AADT of 1,681, the lowest traffic density along the entire route. The US 219 intersection is at the top of a hill known as Chestnut Ridge.
East of Chestnut Ridge, the highway passes over Meadow Mountain at a height of . In eastern Garrett County, traffic on the route gradually increases to an AADT of 2,232. Alt US 40 passes under <a href="Maryland%20Route%20546">MD 546</a>, which runs north from I-68, through <a href="Finzel%2C%20Maryland">Finzel</a>, to the Pennsylvania border. Although Alt US 40 does not directly intersect MD 546, it is connected to MD 546 by way of access road MD 546F, and also by <a href="Maryland%20Route%20946">MD 946</a>, which intersects Alt US 40 near the top of Little Savage Mountain. Just east, the route crosses the larger Big Savage Mountain at an elevation of before entering <a href="Allegany%20County%2C%20Maryland">Allegany County</a>.

After continuing into Allegany County, Alt US 40 descends Savage Mountain into <a href="Frostburg%2C%20Maryland">Frostburg</a>, where it passes through the town as Main Street. Main Street in Frostburg has the highest traffic density on the route, with an AADT of 15,022. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 between exits 33 and 34 has an AADT of 20,931. In west Frostburg, the highway intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%2036">MD 36</a>, which then follows the same road as Alt US 40 for about a mile, separating from Alt US 40 in east Frostburg. In central Frostburg, Main Street intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%20936">MD 936</a>, an old alignment of MD 36. Continuing eastward from Frostburg, traffic density decreases, to an AADT of 13,585 at the <a href="Maryland%20Route%2055">MD 55</a> intersection, staying between 13,000 and 15,000 for the remainder of the highway. Alt US 40 passes through <a href="Eckhart%20Mines%2C%20Maryland">Eckhart Mines</a>, where it intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%20638">MD 638</a>, which connects with MD 36 north of Frostburg. In the eastern part of Eckhart Mines, the highway intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%20743">MD 743</a>, which is an old alignment of US 40 which was bypassed by the roadway which became Alt US 40.
East of Eckhart Mines, Alt US 40 passes through <a href="Clarysville%2C%20Maryland">Clarysville</a>, where it intersects MD 55. It is near Clarysville that the terrain followed by Alt US 40 changes: from Clarysville westward to the summit of Savage Mountain, the road runs uphill, while east of Clarysville, the road follows valleys, first following the valley around Braddock Run to Cumberland, and then following the valley around <a href="Wills%20Creek%20%28North%20Branch%20Potomac%20River%29">Wills Creek</a> into Cumberland. Near the MD 55 intersection is a stone arch bridge which was initially built in 1812 and rebuilt in the 1830s, and carried the National Road over Braddock Run, a tributary to Wills Creek. East of Clarysville, the highway passes through a gap carved by Braddock Run between Piney Mountain and <a href="Dan%27s%20Mountain">Dan's Mountain</a>. I-68, having been built later, is located on the hillside above Alt US 40, on the Dan's Mountain side of the gap. Alt US 40 then descends Red Hill into <a href="La%20Vale%2C%20Maryland">LaVale</a>. At the bottom of Red Hill is the La Vale toll gate house. Built in 1836, tolls were collected there until the early 1900s, and it is the last original National Road toll gate house standing in Maryland. In LaVale, the route intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%2053">MD 53</a>, which serves as a truck bypass for <a href="U.S.%20Route%20220%20in%20Maryland">US  220</a> to <a href="Cresaptown%2C%20Maryland">Cresaptown</a>. Alt US 40 interchanges with westbound I-68 at exit 39, but eastbound access is only available via MD 53 and <a href="Maryland%20Route%20658">MD 658</a>, which intersects Alt US 40 east of the exit 39 interchange. The highway expands to a four-lane road near its intersection with MD 53, then narrows to a two-lane road near its intersection with MD 658. East of the intersection with MD 658, Alt US 40 turns northward, passing through LaVale toward the <a href="Cumberland%20Narrows">Narrows</a>, bypassing <a href="Haystack%20Mountain%20%28Maryland%29">Haystack Mountain</a> to the north, as opposed to I-68, which passes directly over Haystack Mountain, paralleling <a href="Maryland%20Route%2049">Braddock Road (MD 49)</a>.
Northeast of LaVale, Alt US 40 intersects MD 36 at the northern terminus of MD 36. Alt US 40 then passes through the <a href="Cumberland%20Narrows">Narrows</a>, a gap between Haystack Mountain and <a href="Wills%20Mountain">Wills Mountain</a> carved by <a href="Wills%20Creek%20%28North%20Branch%20Potomac%20River%29">Wills Creek</a>, into <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland</a>, where it follows Henderson Avenue and Baltimore Avenue to exit 44 on I-68, where Alt US 40 ends. The roadway continues eastward as <a href="Maryland%20Route%20639">MD 639</a>.
The roadway which became Alt US 40 in <a href="Garrett%20County%2C%20Maryland">Garrett</a> and <a href="Allegany%20County%2C%20Maryland">Allegany</a> counties is, with some realignments, the route followed by the <a href="National%20Road">National Road</a> through western Maryland. Various historic sites associated with the National Road can be found along Alt US 40, including a toll-gate house (<a href="La%20Vale%20Tollgate%20House">La Vale Tollgate House</a>) and mile-marker in <a href="La%20Vale%2C%20Maryland">LaVale</a>. The toll-gate house in LaVale is the last remaining toll-gate house on the National Road in Maryland. Several historic bridges from the National Road, since bypassed by newer bridges, are still present along the route of Alt US 40, including the <a href="Casselman%20Bridge">Casselman Bridge</a> over the <a href="Casselman%20River">Casselman River</a> in <a href="Grantsville%2C%20Maryland">Grantsville</a> and a bridge in <a href="Clarysville%2C%20Maryland">Clarysville</a>.

In 1755, during the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>, British troops under the command of General <a href="Edward%20Braddock">Edward Braddock</a> completed the arduous task of building a road westward from <a href="Fort%20Cumberland%20%28Maryland%29">Fort Cumberland</a>. They largely followed an Indian trail known as Nemacolin's Path, expanding it to a road using only hand tools. The road construction was part of the <a href="Braddock%20Expedition">Braddock Expedition</a>, which was the British campaign to seize <a href="Fort%20Duquesne">Fort Duquesne</a> from the French and Indian forces. Although the military expedition was a failure, the road continued to be used afterwards. However, with little maintenance being done on the road, it decayed over time until by the early nineteenth century little remained of the road. The route followed by Alt US 40 today is very similar to the route followed by Braddock's Road, with the exceptions of various realignments that have been done to the road over the years. For example, Braddock's Road crossed directly over Haystack Mountain west of Cumberland rather than following the Cumberland Narrows as later roads did.

The National Road, the first road funded by the <a href="U.S.%20federal%20government">U.S. federal government</a>, was authorized by the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> in 1806, and ran from <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland, Maryland</a>, to <a href="Vandalia%2C%20Illinois">Vandalia, Illinois</a>. Construction started in 1811, and by 1837 the road reached Vandalia. Many sites from the National Road remain along Alt US 40, in particular the LaVale toll gate house, built in 1836. Following the completion of the National Road in 1837, the federal government ceded the road to the states to operate as a toll road, and toll gate houses such as the one in LaVale were built along its path in preparation for the transfer. Tolls continued to be collected along the National Road at the LaVale toll house until the late nineteenth century. The LaVale toll house is the first of its kind to be built along the National Road, and it is the last standing toll house along the National Road in Maryland. The LaVale toll house was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1977.

Multiple realignments of the road that is now Alt US 40 have occurred since it was originally built as the National Road. Most such realignments are minor, such as to bypass an old bridge, but some have significantly affected the path of the road. One such realignment occurred in 1834, when a new route for the National Road was built through the <a href="Cumberland%20Narrows">Cumberland Narrows</a>. The previous route had followed the <a href="Braddock%20Road%20%28Braddock%20expedition%29">Braddock Road</a>, a route which is now followed by <a href="Maryland%20Route%2049">MD 49</a>. The route following Braddock Road passed over <a href="Haystack%20Mountain%20%28Maryland%29">Haystack Mountain</a> and was much steeper than the newer route through the Narrows. The route through the Narrows allowed the road to bypass this steep mountain ascent. The stone arch bridge built across Will's Creek for the new alignment remained in service until 1932, when a new bridge which is the present bridge across Will's Creek replaced it. The old bridge was torn down during the construction of the Will's Creek flood control system in the 1950s.

Another realignment of Alt US 40 occurred in <a href="Eckhart%20Mines%2C%20Maryland">Eckhart Mines</a>, where in 1969 the road, then designated as US 40, was realigned to the north, bypassing the section of the highway through Eckhart Mines, which has a lower speed limit and sharp curves. The speed limit on the old alignment is , and the new alignment has a speed limit of along most of the bypass. The new alignment intersects the old alignment, designated as <a href="Maryland%20Route%20743">MD 743</a>, on the east end between <a href="Maryland%20Route%20638">MD 638</a> and <a href="Maryland%20Route%2055">MD 55</a>. The west end of the old alignment meets <a href="Maryland%20Route%2036">MD 36</a> just south of its intersection with Alt US 40. MD 638, which prior to the realignment ended at US 40, was not truncated, and thus ends at MD 743.

There are several historic bridges along the National Road that are still present near the current route of Alt US 40. Among them are the Casselman River bridge in Grantsville, and the bridge over Braddock Run, a tributary of <a href="Wills%20Creek%20%28North%20Branch%20Potomac%20River%29">Wills Creek</a>, in Clarysville. The original National Road bridge over the Casselman River was a stone arch bridge constructed in 1813. The span was built to be the largest bridge of its type in the United States at the time, and during its construction it was believed that the bridge could not stand on its own. The bridge was constructed in this manner in the hopes that the <a href="Chesapeake%20and%20Ohio%20Canal">Chesapeake and Ohio Canal</a> would eventually pass under it, though construction on the canal was stopped at <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland</a> in 1850. When US 40 was first designated in 1925, it crossed the Casselman River on the original stone bridge. In 1933, a new steel bridge was constructed to replace the National Road bridge, and it is this bridge that Alt US 40 now follows. The original bridge was declared a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> in 1964, and is now part of the <a href="Casselman%20River%20Bridge%20State%20Park">Casselman River Bridge State Park</a>.

Another historic bridge stands in Clarysville, near the intersection of Alt US 40 and <a href="Maryland%20Route%2055">MD 55</a>. This bridge, which crosses Braddock Run, was built in 1812, with later work being done in 1843. The stone arch bridge, located just south of the current alignment of Alt US 40, was restored in 1976.

Prior to the construction of <a href="Interstate%2068">I-68</a>, US 40 followed the route currently designated as U.S. Route 40 Alternate. The first segment of what would become I-68 was built in <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland</a> in the mid-1960s. The <a href="freeway">freeway</a>, first designated as <a href="US%2048%20%281970s%29">US 48</a>, was extended westward through the 1970s, reaching <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> in 1976. The portions of US 40 that were bypassed between Cumberland and <a href="Keysers%20Ridge%2C%20Maryland">Keysers Ridge</a> became U.S. Route 40 Alternate, which first appeared on <a href="Maryland%20State%20Highway%20Administration">MDSHA</a> maps in the early 1980s. At this time, US 40 was realigned to follow the US 48 freeway, sharing the freeway with US 48. In 1991 the freeway was completed from <a href="Hancock%2C%20Maryland">Hancock</a> to <a href="Morgantown%2C%20West%20Virginia">Morgantown, West Virginia</a>. The US 48 designation was retired, and on August 2, 1991, the freeway became I-68.

2009 Giro d'Italia

The 2009 Giro d'Italia was the 92nd running of the <a href="Giro%20d%27Italia">Giro d'Italia</a>, one of cycling's <a href="Grand%20Tour%20%28cycling%29">Grand Tours</a>. It was held from 9 to 31 May 2009, and marked the 100th year since the first edition of the race. Starting in <a href="Venice">Venice</a> and finishing in Rome, 22 teams competed over 21 stages.

The Giro was raced on a unique path through Italy, taking the <a href="peloton">peloton</a> to some historic cities and towns in Italian cycling. Though the route lacked any well-known, storied climbs, the many <a href="Race%20stage%23Mountain%20stages">intermediate and mountain stages</a> in the second and third weeks of the race proved deceptively difficult. The 10th and the 16th stages were both called the race's <a href="Glossary%20of%20bicycling%23Q">queen stage</a>, as both contained multiple difficult mountain climbs.

Riders protested during the ninth stage, a <a href="criterium">criterium</a> in Milan. This protest was nominally about the overall safety conditions of the stage, and was sparked by life-threatening injuries sustained by <a href="Pedro%20Horrillo">Pedro Horrillo</a> the day before. In the protest, riders declined to contest the stage except for a final sprint finish, a decision that proved controversial with race organizers and fans.

<a href="Denis%20Menchov">Denis Menchov</a> won the race, having taken the lead in a long time trial in stage 12, and defended vigorously against <a href="Glossary%20of%20bicycling%23A">attacks</a> by his closest challenger, <a href="Danilo%20Di%20Luca">Danilo Di Luca</a>, during the mountain stages of the final week. Di Luca came in second, 41 seconds behind the winner, and won the mauve jersey as <a href="points%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">points classification</a> winner. Subsequent to the Giro, both he and third-place finisher <a href="Franco%20Pellizotti">Franco Pellizotti</a> became embroiled in doping scandals, were given bans, and had their results stripped.

Twenty-two teams were announced for the Giro. These included fifteen <a href="UCI%20ProTour">ProTour</a> teams, and seven <a href="List%20of%20UCI%20Professional%20Continental%20and%20Continental%20teams">Professional Continental</a> teams. Three ProTour teams did not wish to participate, and were thus not invited: , , and . Conversely, the organizers of the race originally declined to invite , but changed this decision on 23 April, inviting them as the Giro's 22nd and final team. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Giro began with a <a href="peloton">peloton</a> of 198 cyclists.

The 22 teams that took part in the race were: 
The Astana team did not include 2008 race champion <a href="Alberto%20Contador">Alberto Contador</a>, who chose not to defend his championship, but did include <a href="Lance%20Armstrong">Lance Armstrong</a>, who had recently returned from retirement. Though his appearance was put in doubt after he crashed out of stage 1 of the <a href="2009%20Vuelta%20a%20Castilla%20y%20Le%C3%B3n">Vuelta a Castilla y León</a> and broke his collarbone, Armstrong announced on 16 April that he would start the Giro despite undergoing surgery for his injury. star <a href="Cadel%20Evans">Cadel Evans</a> was originally announced to be taking part in the Giro, but he publicly announced shortly afterward that he would not ride it, and accused <a href="RCS%20Sport">RCS Sport</a> (the organizers of the race) of using his name to promote the event. Contador and Evans both chose to focus on the <a href="2009%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a> later in the season.

Many riders were named as contenders, including <a href="Ivan%20Basso">Ivan Basso</a>, <a href="Levi%20Leipheimer">Levi Leipheimer</a>, Armstrong, <a href="Damiano%20Cunego">Damiano Cunego</a>, <a href="Carlos%20Sastre">Carlos Sastre</a>, <a href="Gilberto%20Simoni">Gilberto Simoni</a>, <a href="Danilo%20Di%20Luca">Danilo Di Luca</a>, <a href="Marzio%20Bruseghin">Marzio Bruseghin</a>, and <a href="Denis%20Menchov">Denis Menchov</a>. Before his collarbone injury, Armstrong was considered an overall favorite, and it was also noted that three time trials, including the insertion of an unusually long time trial mid-race, might favor him. Pre-race analysis noted that Armstrong, when on his best form, would be a rider very likely to gain from having such a long race against the clock included in the Giro.

Former winner <a href="Stefano%20Garzelli">Stefano Garzelli</a> named Leipheimer as the favorite, as did some American media outlets. Armstrong considered Basso to be the favorite when speaking about the Giro in December 2008. Other news outlets also referred to Basso as the pre-race favorite.

Only a small number of stages were expected to end in a sprint, barring a successful breakaway. Sprinters in the event included <a href="Mark%20Cavendish">Mark Cavendish</a>, <a href="Alessandro%20Petacchi">Alessandro Petacchi</a>, <a href="Allan%20Davis%20%28cyclist%29">Allan Davis</a>, <a href="Filippo%20Pozzato">Filippo Pozzato</a>, <a href="Robert%20Hunter%20%28cyclist%29">Robert Hunter</a>, <a href="Robert%20F%C3%B6rster">Robert Förster</a>, <a href="Tyler%20Farrar">Tyler Farrar</a>, <a href="Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Haedo">Juan José Haedo</a>, and <a href="Oscar%20Gatto">Oscar Gatto</a>.

The <a href="1909%20Giro%20d%27Italia">first Giro d'Italia</a> was held in 1909, and the 2009 route was designed to commemorate the 100th anniversary, though interruptions due to <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War I</a> and <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a> meant this was only the 92nd race. <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, which had for years been the city in which the Giro concluded, was the site of a ten-lap <a href="criterium">criterium</a> on the same circuit that began the first Giro d'Italia. Every city that hosted a stage start or finish in the first Giro was visited in 2009 with the exception of <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, although <a href="Arenzano">Arenzano</a> (in the <a href="province%20of%20Genoa">province of Genoa</a>) hosted the finish to stage 11. The 11th stage also went over the <a href="Passo%20del%20Turchino">Passo del Turchino</a>, a climb used every year in the <a href="classic%20cycle%20races">classic</a> cycling race <a href="Milan%E2%80%93San%20Remo">Milan–San Remo</a>.

The tenth stage was planned to mimic stage 17 of the <a href="1949%20Giro%20d%27Italia">1949 Giro d'Italia</a>, which was won by Italian cycling legend <a href="Fausto%20Coppi">Fausto Coppi</a> en route to the overall victory. That route originally included the <a href="Col%20d%27Izoard">Col d'Izoard</a>, a climb in France which has been featured in the <a href="Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a> numerous times. Race organizers were forced to alter this stage to cover only the Italian side of the Alps rather than also visit France, as there were concerns over radio communication in the area, and the roads stood the risk of landslides. It was subsequently made longer than first planned, with an additional, shorter climb added. Stages 10 and 16, the latter of which went over <a href="Monte%20Petrano">Monte Petrano</a> and two other first-category climbs, were both called the race's <a href="glossary%20of%20bicycling%23Q">queen stage</a>.

The route received a small amount of criticism for failing to include any well-known and especially difficult climbs such as the <a href="Passo%20del%20Mortirolo">Passo del Mortirolo</a> or <a href="Monte%20Zoncolan">Monte Zoncolan</a>, instead including stages featuring multiple climbs with lesser ascents. Race director Angelo Zomegnan responded to the criticism by saying, "I won't follow the philosophy that the selection of climbs has to be determined by their names."

The 21 stages of the 2009 Giro d'Italia were divided into five categories: one <a href="team%20time%20trial">team time trial</a>, seven flat stages, four intermediate stages, seven mountain stages and two <a href="individual%20time%20trial">individual time trial</a>s. The type of stage together with the average speed of the winner decided how much time each cyclist would be allowed to finish that stage before being eliminated from the race.
The Giro began with a <a href="team%20time%20trial">team time trial</a> in <a href="Lido%20di%20Venezia">Lido</a>, a <a href="shoal">barrier island</a> in the city of <a href="Venice">Venice</a>. The starting order of the teams was decided by a random draw. , the first team to take the course, won the stage, giving their star sprinter <a href="Mark%20Cavendish">Mark Cavendish</a> the first <a href="pink%20jersey">pink jersey</a> as leader of the race. Cavendish was defeated in a sprint finish the following day by Italian <a href="Alessandro%20Petacchi">Alessandro Petacchi</a>, who was riding for the team. Petacchi became the next wearer of the pink jersey, after he won the Stage 3 sprint into <a href="Valdobbiadene">Valdobbiadene</a>. Cavendish went on to win three mass-start stages, but 's success was not limited to Cavendish's victories nor the team time trial, as <a href="Edvald%20Boasson%20Hagen">Edvald Boasson Hagen</a> and <a href="Kanstantsin%20Sivtsov">Kanstantsin Sivtsov</a> also took stage wins.

The first two high mountain stages of the Giro revealed the men who would battle for the overall race title. <a href="Danilo%20Di%20Luca">Danilo Di Luca</a> of took the win in Stage 4, and put himself just 2 seconds off the pink jersey. The next day, he claimed the jersey, when he was second to stage winner <a href="Denis%20Menchov">Denis Menchov</a> at <a href="Seiser%20Alm">Alpe di Siusi</a> as an elite group of favorites emerged including Menchov, Di Luca, and others who had performed well on the climb and were in high places in the overall standings.

Menchov was fifth after Alpe di Siusi, but rose to second before stage 12, the very long and hilly <a href="individual%20time%20trial">individual time trial</a> in <a href="Cinque%20Terre">Cinque Terre</a>. There, he claimed a convincing victory; only <a href="Levi%20Leipheimer">Levi Leipheimer</a> finished within a minute of Menchov's winning time. Di Luca was nearly two minutes slower than him, finished sixth on the stage, and fell to second overall, with Menchov assuming the race lead. Di Luca tried repeatedly to shed Menchov during the remaining mountain stages to make up the time difference, which was never more than a minute. The two riders were involved in sprints for time bonuses at the finish line in stages 16 and 17, as well as an intermediate sprint in stage 20. Menchov was consistently quicker than Di Luca in these sprints. With his superior time-trial skills providing the difference in the final stage, the Russian was able to emerge as Giro champion, despite a dramatic fall in the final kilometre before the finish line.
<a href="Stefano%20Garzelli">Stefano Garzelli</a> was the winner of the <a href="Mountains%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">mountains classification</a>, gaining points for consistent high placings on the summit stage finishes, as well as a brief breakaway on the mountainous stage 10. The <a href="points%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">points classification</a> was won by Di Luca, after he finished in the top ten in eight of the road stages. The <a href="young%20rider%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">youth classification</a> was won by <a href="Kevin%20Seeldraeyers">Kevin Seeldraeyers</a>, who remained consistent after <a href="Thomas%20L%C3%B6vkvist">Thomas Lövkvist</a> lost nearly 25 minutes on stage 16. Lövkvist had, for one day earlier in the race, led not just the youth but also the general classification.

Controversy arose during the ten-lap Milan <a href="criterium">criterium</a> of the ninth stage, when the riders staged a protest over what they viewed as unsafe riding conditions in that stage and those that preceded it. The most visible cause for the protest was Rabobank rider <a href="Pedro%20Horrillo">Pedro Horrillo</a>'s accident during the eighth stage; Horrillo sustained numerous fractures and head injuries after tumbling over a barricade on the roadside while descending the <a href="Culmine%20di%20San%20Pietro">Culmine di San Pietro</a>. Horrillo fell more than , and nearly died as a result of his injuries. After spending five weeks in hospitals in both Italy and his native Spain, Horrillo eventually recovered, though the day on the Culmine di San Pietro was his last as a professional cyclist, as he retired before the 2010 season began.

The protest at first only involved the criterium being neutralized – that is, the race director agreed that each rider would receive the same finishing time as the stage winner regardless of when they actually crossed the line. After the riders rode a lap of the course, they decided instead not to contest the stage at all, riding the first six circuits slower than previous stages. After four laps, they stopped altogether as race leader Di Luca addressed the unhappy crowd to explain their actions. The times for the stage did not count, and there was no aggressive riding until a final sprint finish. Along with Di Luca, Lance Armstrong was considered the principal voice speaking for the peloton on this day. Although the protest was referred to by some as "unanimous," cyclists such as <a href="Filippo%20Pozzato">Filippo Pozzato</a>, who was himself bearing injuries sustained in a crash that would later force him to leave the race, said the riders had been too hasty in their decision, and that it should have been made conclusively before the stage began. Armstrong apologized to the fans for the effect the protest had on what was supposed to be a grand spectacle, but also contended that it was the correct decision for the peloton to make.

Success in stages was limited to a few teams. Though there were nearly as many stages (21) as teams in the event (22), only eight teams ultimately came away with stage victories. Six different riders won multiple stages – Cavendish, Petacchi, Menchov, Di Luca, <a href="Carlos%20Sastre">Carlos Sastre</a>, and <a href="Michele%20Scarponi">Michele Scarponi</a>. Teammates of Sastre, Scarponi and Cavendish were also stage winners; Sastre's provided the winners to stages 14 (<a href="Simon%20Gerrans">Simon Gerrans</a>) and 21 (<a href="Ignatas%20Konovalovas">Ignatas Konovalovas</a>), and Scarponi's teammate <a href="Leonardo%20Bertagnolli">Leonardo Bertagnolli</a> was the winner of stage 15. The only teams to be single stage winners were with <a href="Franco%20Pellizotti">Franco Pellizotti</a> in stage 17, and with classics specialist <a href="Philippe%20Gilbert">Philippe Gilbert</a> three days later in a stage thought to resemble a <a href="Classic%20cycle%20races">classic</a>. Pellizotti was also the third-place overall finisher. With wins for Quick Step's Seeldraeyers in the youth classification, Garzelli of Acqua & Sapone in the climbers' competition, and in the Trofeo Fast Team ranking, 11 teams – half of the total entries – won significant prizes during the race.

About two months after the event concluded, on 22 July, it was announced that second place overall finisher and points classification winner Di Luca had given two positive tests for <a href="continuous%20erythropoietin%20receptor%20activator">continuous erythropoietin receptor activator</a> (CERA, an <a href="erythropoietin">erythropoietin</a> derivative) on 20 and 28 May, before the <a href="Cinque%20Terre">Cinque Terre</a> time trial and the <a href="Mount%20Vesuvius">Mount Vesuvius</a> stage in the race's final week. He was provisionally suspended with immediate effect by the <a href="Union%20Cycliste%20Internationale">Union Cycliste Internationale</a> (UCI), cycling's <a href="sport%20governing%20body">governing body</a>. It was announced on 8 August that the analyses of the B-samples from those controls confirmed the initial results, making it likely that Di Luca will be stripped of some or all of his results from the race. fired him on 13 August. Di Luca at first maintained his innocence and claimed a conspiracy against him by the labs handling the tests. A period of legal maneuvering between Di Luca and the <a href="Italian%20National%20Olympic%20Committee">Italian National Olympic Committee</a> (CONI) followed. CONI officials asked their anti-doping tribunal (TNA) to suspend Di Luca for three years – while two years is a customary ban for a doping positive, CONI prosecutors sought a third year for recidivism, stemming from Di Luca's <a href="2007%20Giro%20d%27Italia%23Doping%20cases">previous doping incident</a> two years earlier. He was given a two-year suspension, retroactive to July 2009, and indicated that he would appeal it to the <a href="Court%20of%20Arbitration%20for%20Sport">Court of Arbitration for Sport</a>. In October 2010, Di Luca was reinstated to active status by CONI, due to his cooperation with several ongoing doping investigations, though his results were indeed stricken from the record. On 10 January 2011, he signed with and indicated that he would return to the Giro in <a href="2011%20Giro%20d%27Italia">2011</a> to support Katusha team leader <a href="Joaquim%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Joaquim Rodríguez</a>.

Five days before the start of the <a href="2010%20Giro%20d%27Italia">2010 Giro d'Italia</a>, 2009 podium finisher Pellizotti was identified as a rider of interest to the UCI's <a href="biological%20passport">biological passport</a> program due to irregular blood values. He was removed from his team's start list for the Giro and provisionally suspended. The UCI asked that CONI open disciplinary proceedings against him, which had no resolution until after the 2010 season finished. TNA cleared him on 21 October and declared him free to race, at which time the Liquigas team intended to re-sign him. The UCI decided in January 2011 to appeal his case to the CAS. The hearing was held in March, and Pellizotti asked for a quick resolution, with plans to return with in the <a href="2011%20Tirreno%E2%80%93Adriatico">2011 Tirreno–Adriatico</a> if he were cleared. The court reached its decision after five days, upholding the UCI's appeal, handing Pellizotti a two-year ban, and stripping all his results from this Giro and the <a href="2009%20Tour%20de%20France">2009 Tour de France</a>. Consequently, Pellizotti has said he is quitting the sport.

In the 2009 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the <a href="general%20classification">general classification</a>, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner is considered the winner of the Giro.

Additionally, there was a <a href="points%20classification">points classification</a>, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.

There was also a <a href="mountains%20classification">mountains classification</a>, which awarded a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The highest point in the Giro (called the "Cima Coppi"), which in 2009 was Sestrière in stage 10, afforded more points than the other first-category climbs.

The fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, which awarded a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1984 were eligible.

There were also two classifications for teams. The first was the Trofeo Fast Team. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team.

The rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.

Other less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour. Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the "Traguardo Volante", or T.V. The T.V. gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was known in previous years as the "Intergiro" and the "Expo Milano 2015" classification. It was won by Italian <a href="Giovanni%20Visconti%20%28cyclist%29">Giovanni Visconti</a>, of .

Other awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Mountains classification winner <a href="Stefano%20Garzelli">Stefano Garzelli</a> won this award. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. It was won, like the closely associated points classification, by <a href="Danilo%20Di%20Luca">Danilo Di Luca</a>. Additionally, the "Trofeo Fuga Cervelo" rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear.

Toothcomb

A toothcomb (also tooth comb or dental comb) is a <a href="Dentition">dental</a> structure found in some mammals, comprising a group of front teeth arranged in a manner that facilitates grooming, similar to a <a href="hair%20comb">hair comb</a>. The toothcomb occurs in <a href="Lemuriformes">lemuriform</a> <a href="primate">primate</a>s (which includes <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s and <a href="Lorisoidea">lorisoids</a>), <a href="treeshrew">treeshrew</a>s, <a href="colugo">colugo</a>s, <a href="hyrax">hyrax</a>es, and some African <a href="antelope">antelope</a>s. The structures evolved independently in different types of mammals through <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a> and vary both in dental composition and structure. In most mammals the comb is formed by a group of teeth with fine spaces between them. The toothcombs in most mammals include incisors only, while in lemuriform primates they include <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and <a href="Canine%20tooth">canine teeth</a> that tilt forward at the front of the lower jaw, followed by a canine-shaped first <a href="premolar">premolar</a>. The toothcombs of colugos and hyraxes take a different form with the individual incisors being serrated, providing multiple <a href="wikt%3Atine">tines</a> per tooth.

The toothcomb is usually used for <a href="personal%20grooming">grooming</a>. While licking the fur clean, the animal will run the toothcomb through the fur to comb it. Fine grooves or striations are usually cut into the teeth during grooming by the hair and may be seen on the sides of the teeth when viewed through a <a href="scanning%20electron%20microscope">scanning electron microscope</a>. The toothcomb is kept clean by either the tongue or, in the case of lemuriforms, the <a href="sublingua">sublingua</a>, a specialized "under-tongue". The toothcomb can have other functions, such as food procurement and bark gouging. Within lemuriforms, <a href="fork-marked%20lemur">fork-marked lemur</a>s and <a href="Indriidae">indriids</a> have more robust toothcombs to support these secondary functions. In some lemurs, such as the <a href="aye-aye">aye-aye</a>, the toothcomb has been lost completely and replaced with other specialized dentition.

In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb has been used by scientists in the interpretation of the <a href="Evolutionary%20history%20of%20lemurs">evolution of lemurs</a> and their kin. They are thought to have evolved from early <a href="Adapiformes">adapiform</a> primates around the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> or earlier. One popular hypothesis is that they evolved from European <a href="Adapidae">adapids</a>, but the <a href="Fossil">fossil record</a> suggests that they evolved from an older lineage that migrated to Africa during the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> (66 to 55 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>) and might have evolved from early <a href="Cercamoniinae">cercamoniines</a> from Asia. Fossil primates such as "<a href="Djebelemur">Djebelemur</a>", "<a href="%27Anchomomys%27%20milleri">'Anchomomys' milleri</a>", and "<a href="Plesiopithecus">Plesiopithecus</a>" may have been their closest relatives. The lack of a distinct toothcomb in the fossil record before to 40 mya has created a conflict with <a href="molecular%20clock">molecular clock</a> studies that suggest an older <a href="Genetic%20divergence">divergence</a> between lemurs and lorisoids, and the existence of a <a href="ghost%20lineage">ghost lineage</a> of lemuriform primates in Africa.

The toothcomb, a special morphological arrangement of teeth in the anterior <a href="Mandible">lower jaw</a>, is best known in <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> <a href="Strepsirrhini">strepsirrhine primates</a>, which include <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s and <a href="Lorisoidea">lorisoid</a> primates (collectively known as lemuriforms). This <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homologous structure</a> is a diagnostic character that helps define this <a href="clade">clade</a> (related group) of <a href="primate">primate</a>s. An <a href="Analogy%20%28biology%29">analogous trait</a> is found in the <a href="bald%20uakari">bald uakari</a> ("Cacajao calvus"), a type of <a href="New%20World%20monkey">New World monkey</a>.

Toothcombs can also be found in colugos and treeshrews, both close relatives of primates; however, the structures are different and these are considered to examples of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>. Likewise, small- or medium-sized African <a href="antelope">antelope</a>s, such as the <a href="impala">impala</a> ("Aepyceros melampus"), have a similar structure sometimes referred to as the "lateral dental grooming apparatus". Living and extinct hyraxes (hyracoids) also exhibit a toothcomb, although the number of tines in the comb vary throughout the fossil record.

Dating to the Eocene epoch over 50 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>, "<a href="Chriacus">Chriacus</a>" and "<a href="Thryptacodon">Thryptacodon</a>"—two types of <a href="Arctocyonidae">arctocyonids</a> (primitive <a href="Eutheria">placental mammals</a>)—also possessed an independently evolved toothcomb.

The toothcomb of most lemuriforms includes six finely spaced teeth, four <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and two <a href="Canine%20tooth">canine teeth</a> that are procumbent (tilt forward) in the front of the mouth. The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them, but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the incisors. In the <a href="Permanent%20teeth">permanent dentition</a>, the canines erupt after the incisors. The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt, and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side. The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline. As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely.
The French <a href="Anatomy">anatomist</a> <a href="Henri%20Marie%20Ducrotay%20de%20Blainville">Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville</a> first identified the two <a href="Lateral%20%28anatomy%29">lateral</a> teeth of the lemuriform toothcomb as canines in 1840. Canine teeth are normally used to pierce or grasp objects. With modified lower canine teeth, the first lower <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s following the toothcomb are usually shaped like typical canine teeth (caniniform) and assume their function. These premolars are commonly confused with canines. Normally the true canines in the lower jaw sit in front of the upper canines, and in toothcombed primates, the caniniform premolars rest behind it.

The lemuriform toothcomb is kept clean by the <a href="sublingua">sublingua</a> or "under-tongue", a specialized muscular structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. The sublingua can extend below the end of the tongue and is tipped with <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ized, serrated points that rake between the front teeth.

Among lemurs, the toothcomb is variable in structure. Among <a href="Indriidae">indriids</a> (Indriidae), the toothcomb is less procumbent and consists of four teeth instead of six. The indriid toothcomb is more robust and wider, with shorter incisors, wider spaces between the teeth (interdental spaces), and a broader apical ridge. It is unclear whether this four-toothed toothcomb consists of two pairs of incisors or one pair of incisors and one pair of canines. In <a href="fork-marked%20lemur">fork-marked lemur</a>s ("Phaner") the toothcomb is more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces. All six teeth are longer, straighter, and form a more continuous apical ridge. In the recently extinct <a href="monkey%20lemur">monkey lemur</a>s (Archaeolemuridae) and <a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a>s (Palaeopropithecidae), the toothcomb was lost and the incisors and canines resumed a typical configuration in the front of the mouth. The aye-aye also lost its toothcomb, replacing it with continually growing (hypselodont) front teeth, similar to the incisors of <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s.

In colugos, the toothcomb has a completely different structure. Instead of individual incisors and canine teeth being finely spaced to act like the teeth of a comb, the biting edge of the four incisors have become serrated with as many as 15 tines each, while the canine acts more like a molar. These serrated incisors are kept clean using the front of the tongue, which is serrated to match the serrations of the incisors. Similarly, the hyracoid toothcomb consists of incisors with multiple tines, called "<a href="pecten%20%28biology%29%23Etymology">pectinations</a>". In contrast to the colugos, the size and shape of the tines are more uniform.

The toothcomb of treeshrews is like the lemuriform toothcomb in that it uses interdental spaces to form the comb tines, but only two of its three pairs of lower incisors are included in the toothcomb and the canines are also excluded. The lateral two incisors in the toothcomb are generally larger. In the extinct arctocyonids, all six lower incisors were part of the toothcomb. In African antelopes, the toothcomb is strikingly similar to that of lemuriforms in that it consists of two pairs of incisors and a pair of canines.

As a homologous structure in lemuriforms, the toothcomb serves variable biological roles, despite its superficially stereotypic shape and appearance. It is primarily used as a toiletry device or grooming comb. Additionally, some species use their toothcomb for food procurement or to gouge tree bark.

The primary function of the toothcomb, grooming, was first noted by the French <a href="Natural%20history">naturalist</a> <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> in 1829, who pointed out that the <a href="ring-tailed%20lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a> ("Lemur catta") had lower incisors that ""sont de véritables peignes"" ("are real combs"). More than 100 years later, the grooming function was questioned since it was difficult to observe and the interdental spaces were thought to be too small for fur. Observations later showed the teeth were used for that purpose and that immediately after grooming, hair may be found trapped in the teeth, but is removed by the sublingua later.

In 1981, <a href="Scanning%20electron%20microscope">scanning electron microscopy</a> revealed fine grooves or striations on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only found on the sides of the teeth on the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20 <a href="Micrometre">µm</a> wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1 µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.

Among non-primates, the extinct "Chriacus" exhibits microscopic groves on its toothcomb, but the <a href="Philippine%20colugo">Philippine colugo</a> ("Cynocephalus volans") does not. The toothcomb of the colugos is generally considered to function as a toothcomb, but due to the lack of striations on the teeth and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral grooming, its use seems to be limited to food procurement.

In African antelopes, the lateral dental grooming apparatus does not appear to be used during <a href="grazing">grazing</a> or <a href="Browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browsing</a>. Instead, it is used during grooming when the head sweeps upward in a distinctive motion. It is thought to comb the fur and remove <a href="ectoparasite">ectoparasite</a>s.

In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb may also play a secondary role in <a href="olfaction">olfaction</a>, which may account for the size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions which are then spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the <a href="philtrum">philtrum</a> (a cleft in the middle of the wet nose, or <a href="rhinarium">rhinarium</a>) to the <a href="vomeronasal%20organ">vomeronasal organ</a> in the roof of the mouth. This would allow <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.

<a href="Mouse%20lemur">Mouse lemur</a>s ("Microcebus"), <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a>s ("Propithecus"), and the <a href="indri">indri</a> ("Indri") use their toothcombs to scoop up fruit pulp. Other small lemuriforms, such as fork-marked lemurs ("Phaner"), the <a href="hairy-eared%20dwarf%20lemur">hairy-eared dwarf lemur</a> ("Allocebus"), and <a href="galago">galago</a>s (particularly the <a href="Genus">genera</a> "<a href="Lesser%20bushbaby">Galago</a>" and "<a href="Needle-clawed%20bushbaby">Euoticus</a>") use their toothcombs to tooth-scrape plant exudates, such as <a href="Gum%20%28botany%29">gum</a> and <a href="Plant%20sap">sap</a>. In fork-marked lemurs, the toothcomb is specially adapted to minimize food trapment since the interdental spaces are greatly reduced. The <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a> colugos in the genus "<a href="Cynocephalus">Cynocephalus</a>" may also use their toothcomb for food procurement.

Indriids such as the sifakas use their toothcombs to gouge bark or dead wood (bark-prising), which is done before scent-marking with the gland on their chest. The more robust structure of their toothcomb is thought to help it withstand the compressive forces experienced during regular bark-prising.

The origins of the lemuriform toothcomb and the clade it characterizes have been the center of considerable debate for more than a century. In 1920, British <a href="Paleoanthropology">palaeoanthropologist</a> <a href="Wilfrid%20Le%20Gros%20Clark">Wilfrid Le Gros Clark</a> proposed that the toothcomb found in treeshrews (which he believed were primates) was an early version of the dental structure found in lemuriforms. Because he viewed the fossil lorisoids from the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> as not having fully developed the modern lemuriform toothcomb, he implied that lemurs and lorisoids had evolved the trait independently. This view was later overturned, and the <a href="Monophyly">monophyletic relationship</a> between lemurs and lorisoids is now accepted.

The ancestral condition of the anterior dentition on the lower jaw, based on Eocene primate fossils, suggests that earliest primates had lacked a differentiated toothcomb. Most fossil strepsirrhines lacked the stereotypic lemuriform toothcomb. Collectively, early strepsirrhine primates are known as <a href="Adapiformes">adapiforms</a>. Adapiforms are considered to be a <a href="Paraphyly">paraphyletic</a> group (containing many but not all of the descendants of the last common ancestor of the group's members) because the lemuriforms are assumed to have evolved from one of several groups of adapiforms. In terms of ecology, the evolution of the toothcomb is assumed to have required a <a href="Folivore">folivorous</a> (leaf-eating) diet among the ancestral adapiform population, since that would select for reduced incisors, which would serve as an <a href="exaptation">exaptation</a> (a trait with adaptive value for something other than what it was originally selected for), which could then be used for personal or <a href="social%20grooming">social grooming</a>. However, the inclusion of the canines into the toothcomb must have required exceptional conditions, since large lemuriforms have secondarily modified caniniform premolars to substitute for the loss.

A popular hypothesis about the origins of the lemuriform clade is that they evolved from European adapiforms known as <a href="Adapidae">adapids</a>. In some adapids, the crests of the lower incisors and canines align to form functional cropping unit, and the American <a href="Paleontology">paleontologist</a> <a href="Philip%20D.%20Gingerich">Philip D. Gingerich</a> has suggested this foreshadowed the development of the lemuriform toothcomb. However, no lemuriform toothcomb has been found in the fossil record of the Eocene, and the European adapid lower jaws from that time did not resemble the derived state seen in lemuriforms.

Lemuriforms are currently thought to have evolved in Africa, and the earliest known strepsirrhine primates from Africa are <a href="Azibiidae">azibiids</a> from the early Eocene, which likely descended from a very early colonization of the Afro-Arabian land mass in the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> (66 to 55 mya). <a href="Stem%20group">Stem</a> lemuriforms, including "<a href="Djebelemur">Djebelemur</a>" and "<a href="%27Anchomomys%27%20milleri">'Anchomomys' milleri</a>", have been found in Africa and date from 50 to 48 mya and were very distinct from European adapiforms. However, they lack a toothcomb. These stem lemuriforms suggest an early common ancestry with <a href="Cercamoniinae">cercamoniines</a> from outside of Europe. Based on large, procumbent lower teeth, "<a href="Plesiopithecus">Plesiopithecus</a>", a fossil primate found in late Eocene deposits at the <a href="Faiyum%20Oasis">Fayum Depression</a> in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, is thought to be most closely related to lemuriforms. Together, "Djebelemur", "‘Anchomomys’ milleri", and "Plesiopithecus" are considered to be <a href="Sister%20group">sister taxa</a> (the closest relatives) of lemuriform primates.

Although stem lemuriforms like "Djebelemur" may have been contemporaneous with related toothcombed primates around 50 to 48 mya, the sparse African fossil record suggests toothcomb differentiation occurred around 52 to 40 mya according to the French paleoanthropologist <a href="Marc%20Godinot">Marc Godinot</a>. This would conflict with the <a href="molecular%20clock">molecular clock</a> estimates by <a href="Evolutionary%20anthropology">evolutionary anthropologist</a> <a href="Anne%20Yoder">Anne Yoder</a> and others, which predict lemur–lorisoid divergence dating between 61 and 90.8 mya.

In 2001, the discovery of "<a href="Bugtilemur">Bugtilemur</a>", a fossil primate from <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> dating to the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> and initially thought to be a <a href="Cheirogaleidae">cheirogaleid</a> lemur, further challenged the <a href="Evolutionary%20history%20of%20lemurs">theory of lemur origins</a>; however, it was later shown to be a type of adapiform primate and not a lemur.

The minimum paleontological estimate for the divergence of lemurs and lorisoids nearly doubled when additional discoveries were made in northern Egypt during the 2000s of a stem galagid ("<a href="Saharagalago">Saharagalago</a>") and a stem or crown lorisoid ("<a href="Karanisia">Karanisia</a>") dating to 37 and 40 mya respectively. "Karanisia" is the oldest fossil primate to exhibit a distinct lemuriform toothcomb. This, as well as studies of other African adapiforms like "‘Anchomomys’ milleri", suggests a more ancient <a href="ghost%20lineage">ghost lineage</a> for lemuriforms in Africa.

The <a href="Evolutionary%20pressure">selective pressure</a> that shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb has been a topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence can be seen as supporting a grooming function, food procurement function, or both. In the early 1900s, there was less debate. Grooming was seen as the primary function since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although <a href="prosimian">prosimian</a> primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one <a href="grooming%20claw">grooming claw</a> on each foot to compensate. Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary function and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its function and obscured its original function.

The hypothesis that the toothcomb evolved for food procurement was based on observations of recent lemuriform <a href="Taxon">taxa</a>, such as <a href="Cheirogaleidae">cheirogaleid</a> lemurs (particularly fork-marked lemurs and the hairy-eared dwarf lemur) and galagos, which demonstrate tooth-scraping of plant exudates, as well as sifakas, which practice bark-prising. Each of these were considered "primitive" forms among the living strepsirrhines, suggesting the first lemuriforms exhibited similar behaviors. Also, strong selective pressure from feeding ecology placed on the anterior dentition was emphasized, based on the specialized upper anterior dentition seen in the recently extinct <a href="koala%20lemur">koala lemur</a>s ("Megaladapis"). If feeding ecology could have such profound effects on the shape of the anterior dentition, then convergent evolution might explain the similarities seen between the compressed lower incisors of the lemuriform toothcomb and the exudate feeding adaptations in the genus "<a href="Callithrix">Callithrix</a>" (a type of <a href="marmoset">marmoset</a>).

In contrast, the grooming hypothesis emphasized that all lemuriforms use their toothcombs for grooming, and long, thin teeth are poorly suited for the mechanical stress of gouging and exudate feeding. Also the interdental spaces seen in most lemuriforms favor fur combing and would also promote bacterial growth and tooth decay if used for exudate feeding. Supporting this, reduced interdental spacing is found in exudate feeding lemuriforms. Furthermore, the canine included in the toothcomb provides additional interdental spacing for fur combing. Even the behavior of young lemuriforms suggests that grooming plays a more important role in the use of the toothcomb than food procurement.

AMX-30E

The AMX-30E ("E" stands for "España", Spanish for Spain) is a Spanish <a href="main%20battle%20tank">main battle tank</a> based on France's <a href="AMX-30">AMX-30</a>. Although originally the Spanish government sought to procure the German <a href="Leopard%201">Leopard 1</a>, the AMX-30 was ultimately awarded the contract due to its lower price and the ability to manufacture it in Spain. 280 units were manufactured by <a href="Santa%20B%C3%A1rbara%20Sistemas">Santa Bárbara Sistemas</a> for the <a href="Spanish%20Army">Spanish Army</a>, between 1974 and 1983.

First acquired in 1970, the tank was to supplement Spain's fleet of <a href="M47%20Patton">M47</a> and <a href="M48%20Patton">M48 Patton</a> United States tanks and to reduce Spain's reliance on American equipment in its army. The first 19 AMX-30 tanks were acquired from France in 1970, while another 280 were assembled in Spain. It was Spain's first <a href="Mass%20production">mass-produced</a> <a href="tank">tank</a> and developed the country's industry to the point where the government felt it could produce a tank on its own, leading to the development of the <a href="Lince%20%28tank%29">Lince</a> tank project in 1985. It also offered Santa Bárbara Sistemas the experience which led to the production of the <a href="Leopard%202E">Leopard 2E</a> in late 2003. Although final assembly was carried out by Santa Bárbara Sistemas, the production of the AMX-30E also included other companies in the country. Total production within Spain amounted to as much as 65% of the tank.

Spain's AMX-30E fleet went through two separate modifications in the late 1980s, a modernization program and a reconstruction program. The former, named the AMX-30EM2 (150 tanks), sought to modernize and improve the vehicle's automotive characteristics, while the latter, or the AMX-30EM1 (149 tanks), resulted in a more austere improvement of the tank's <a href="Tank%23Tactical%20mobility">power plant</a> by maintaining the existing engine and replacing the <a href="Transmission%20%28mechanics%29">transmission</a>. Both programs extended the vehicle's lifetime. Spain's fleet of AMX-30EM1s was replaced in the late 1990s by the German <a href="Leopard%202A4">Leopard 2A4</a>, and the AMX-30EM2s were replaced by <a href="B1%20Centauro">Centauro</a> wheeled <a href="Tank%20destroyer">anti-tank vehicle</a>s in the early 21st century.

Although 19 AMX-30Es were deployed to the <a href="Spanish%20Sahara">Spanish Sahara</a> in 1970, the tank never saw combat. In 1985 Indonesia expressed interest in the AMX-30E, while in 2004 the Spanish and <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>n governments discussed the possible sale of around 40 AMX-30EM2s. Both trade deals fell through.

In 1960, Spain's tank fleet was composed mainly of American <a href="M47%20Patton">M47 Patton</a> tanks, with some newer <a href="M48%20Patton">M48 Patton</a> tanks. The M47s had been acquired by the Spanish army in the mid-1950s, replacing the previous fleet of 1930s-vintage <a href="Panzer%20I">Panzer I</a>, <a href="T-26">T-26</a> and <a href="Panzer%20IV">Panzer IV</a> tank designs. During the 1957-58 <a href="Ifni%20War">Ifni War</a>, the United States' ban on the usage of American ordnance supplied earlier as military aid to Spain pushed Spain to look for alternative equipment which could be freely employed in the <a href="Spanish%20Sahara">Spanish Sahara</a>.

In the early 1960s, Spain looked towards its European neighbors for a new tank. The Spanish government first approached <a href="Krauss-Maffei">Krauss-Maffei</a>, the German manufacturer of the <a href="Leopard%201">Leopard 1</a>, and the company applied for an export license from the German Economics Ministry. Spain's status as a non-<a href="NATO">NATO</a> country meant that the decision to grant the export license had to be reviewed by the "Bundessicherheitsrat" (Federal Security Council), or the BSR, which was responsible for the coordination of the national defense policy. Ultimately, the council ruled that Krauss-Maffei could sign an export contract with Spain. The deal was, however, stalled by pressure from the United Kingdom's <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> on the basis that the Leopard's 105-millimeter (4.13 in) <a href="Royal%20Ordnance%20L7">L7 tank gun</a> was British technology. Meanwhile, Spain tested the French AMX-30 between 2 and 10 June 1964.

The Leopard 1 and the AMX-30 originated from a joint tank development program known as the Europanzer. For a tank, the AMX-30 had a low silhouette; the height of the tank was 2.28 meters (7.48 ft), compared to the Leopard's 2.6 meters (8.53 ft). In terms of lethality, the AMX-30's "Obus G" <a href="high-explosive%20anti-tank%20warhead">high-explosive anti-tank</a> (HEAT) round was one of the most advanced projectiles at the time. Because HEAT warheads become less efficient during spin stabilization induced by the <a href="rifling">rifling</a> of a tank-gun barrel, the "Obus G" was designed so that the <a href="shaped%20charge">shaped charge</a> warhead was mounted on ball bearings within an outer casing, allowing the round to be spin stabilized through the rifling of the gun without affecting the warhead inside. The "Obus G" was designed to penetrate up to 400 millimeters (15.75 in) of <a href="steel">steel</a> <a href="Vehicle%20armour">armor</a>. On the other hand, the Leopard was armed with the <a href="L7A3">L7A3</a> <a href="tank%20gun">tank gun</a>, capable of penetrating the frontal armor of most contemporary tanks. Although the Leopard boasted greater armor than the AMX-30—partially accounting for the weight difference between the two tanks—the latter was sold at a cheaper price.

In May 1970, the Spanish government decided to sign a contract with the French company <a href="GIAT">GIAT</a> to begin production of the AMX-30. However, it was not the advantages of the French vehicle itself that influenced the decision. Rather, it was the UK's unwillingness to sell their L7 tank-gun, the low cost of the AMX-30, and the French offer to allow Spain to manufacture the tank, that led the Spanish Army to favor the French armored vehicle.

On 22 June 1970, the Spanish Ministry of Defense signed an agreement of military cooperation with France, which outlined plans for the future acquisition of around 200 tanks for the Spanish Army. Of these, 180 were to be manufactured under license in Spain and 20 were to be manufactured by France. Ultimately, GIAT was contracted to manufacture 19 tanks. These were delivered to the <a href="Spanish%20Legion">Spanish Legion</a>'s "Bakali" company, deployed in the Spanish Sahara. The first six AMX-30s were delivered by rail to the Spanish border city of <a href="Irun">Irún</a>, in the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Country</a>, and then transferred to Bilbao. Finally, they were shipped by the <a href="Spanish%20Navy">Spanish Navy</a>, on the transport "Almirante Lobo", to <a href="El%20Aai%C3%BAn">El Aaiún</a> in the Spanish Sahara. This unit existed until 1975, when it was disbanded and its tanks transferred to the "Uad-Ras" Mechanized Infantry Regiment.

This agreement laid the foundations for the upcoming tank plant at the industrial polygon of "Las Canteras", near the town of <a href="Alcal%C3%A1%20de%20Guada%C3%ADra">Alcalá de Guadaíra</a>. Several parts of the tank were subcontracted to other Spanish companies, including "Astilleros Españoles" (turret), "Boetticher", "Duro Felguera" and <a href="E.%20N.%20Baz%C3%A1n">E. N. Bazán</a>. The grade of local production varied per batch. The first 20 tanks were to have 18% of each vehicle manufactured in Spain; the next 40 would have 40% of the vehicle manufactured in Spain. The other 120 had 65% of the tank manufactured in the country. Production began in 1974, at a rate of five tanks per month, and ended on 25 June 1979. The first five tanks were delivered to the "Uad Ras" Mechanized Infantry Regiment on 30 October 1974. This batch also replaced the <a href="M41%20Walker%20Bulldog">M41 Walker Bulldog</a> light tanks and <a href="M48%20Patton">M48 Patton</a> tanks in the Armored Cavalry Regiment "Villaviciosa" and the Armored Infantry Regiment "Alcázar de Toledo", receiving 23 and 44 tanks, respectively.

On 27 March 1979, prior to the end of production of the first batch, the Spanish Army and Santa Bárbara Sistemas signed a contract for the production and delivery of a second batch of 100 AMX-30Es. In 1980, after the 200th AMX-30E was delivered to the Spanish Army, the tank's patent was awarded to Spain. This allowed minor modifications to be done to the vehicle without having to consult GIAT. It also meant that the degree of local construction of each vehicle augmented considerably. Production of the second batch lasted between 1979 and 1983. By the time production ended, the Spanish Army fielded 299 AMX-30Es (280 produced between 1974 and 1983, and 19 delivered from France in 1970) and 4 training vehicles delivered in 1975. Santa Bárbara Sistemas also manufactured 18 "Roland España" (denominated AMX-30RE) anti-air vehicles and 10 AMX-30D <a href="armored%20recovery%20vehicle">armored recovery vehicle</a>s. The average cost per tank, in the first batch, was 45 million <a href="Spanish%20peseta">peseta</a>s (US$642,800). Cost per tank increased during the second batch to 62 million pesetas (885,700 dollars).

Although brand new, the AMX-30E entered service with automotive issues, including problems with the antiquated 5SD-200D transmission. Consequently, as the first production batch began to end, the Spanish Army and Santa Bárbara Sistemas began to study possible upgrades. The main objectives were to increase the power and the reliability of the power pack, an improvement to the tank's firepower and accuracy, as well as to increase the vehicle's ballistic protection and overall survivability. A number of modernization packages were proposed, including a suggestion to mount the AMX-30E's turret on a Leopard 1's chassis. Other options included swapping the existing power pack for a new American diesel engine and transmission or exchanging the power pack for a new German diesel engine and transmission. More austere versions of these same options were offered, pairing the existing <a href="HS-110">HS-110</a> engine with the already mentioned transmissions. Another prototype was produced using the Leopard's more modern tracks, and another similar prototype mounted a new 12.7-millimeter (0.5 in) <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> for the loader's position. France's GIAT also offered to modernize Spain's AMX-30Es to AMX-30B2 standards, a modernization being applied to French AMX-30s.

Ultimately, a mixed solution named "Tecnología Santa Bárbara-Bazán" (Santa Bárbara-Bazán Technology) (or TSB) was chosen. The improvement of the tank's mobility entailed replacing the HS-110 diesel engine with an <a href="MTU%20Friedrichshafen">MTU</a> 833 Ka-501 diesel engine, producing 850 metric horsepower (625 kW), and the transmission with a German ZF LSG-3000, compatible with engines of up to 1,500 metric horsepower (1103 kW). The first 30 engines were to have 50% of the engine manufactured in Spain; the rest, 73% were to be produced indigenously. This new engine gave the modernized tank a power ratio of 23 metric horsepower per tonne (21.13 hp/S/T). The new engine was coupled with the AMX-30B2's improved torsion-bar suspension, which used larger diameter torsion-bars and new shocks.

To improve the tank's firepower, the gun mount around the loader's turret hatch was modified to allow the installation of a 12.7-millimeter (0.5 in) machine gun, while the main gun's firepower was augmented through the introduction of the new CETME437A <a href="Kinetic%20energy%20penetrator">armor-piercing, fin-stabilized discarding sabot</a> (APFSDS). The gun's accuracy was improved through the installation of the new Mark 9 modification A/D fire control system, designed by <a href="Hughes%20Aircraft%20Company">Hughes Aircraft Company</a>. The new system allowed firing during the day and during night operations, and increased the likelihood of a first round impact. The fire control system was also modernized through the exchange of the old M282 gunner's periscope with a new periscope and a new <a href="laser%20rangefinder">laser rangefinder</a>. A new ballistics computer, the NSC-800, was issued, as well as a new digital panel for the gunner, designed and manufactured by the Spanish company INISEL. The tank commander also received a control unit that allowed the choice of ammunition for the gun and provided information on the ballistics of the round and the target to be engaged. As a result, the loader received a presentation unit to display information on which round to load into the gun's breech and to communicate ballistic data received, including <a href="angular%20velocity">angular velocity</a>, wind velocity, gun elevation and vehicle inclination. The fire control system also allowed for the future upgrade to a more sophisticated stabilization system for the tank's main gun. Survivability improvements included the addition of new steel side-skirts, a new smoke generating system linked to the engine and a new fire suppression system.

One hundred fifty AMX-30Es received this modernization package and were designated AMX-30EM2s. The program began in 1989 and ended in 1993. Ultimately, Spain's AMX-30EM2s were replaced by brand-new <a href="B1%20Centauro">Centauro</a> anti-tank vehicles, which were partially manufactured in Spain, in the early 21st century.

The other 149 AMX-30Es were reconstructed to improve their mobility. The reconstruction consisted of the replacement of the original French transmission with the American Allison CD-850-6A. Furthermore, several parts of the tank, such as the brakes, were renovated in order to bring them up to their original standards. The CD-850-6A was an automatic transmission, with a triple differential providing two forward velocities and one reverse velocity. However, the new transmission resulted in a new problem. The excessive heat produced by the transmission reduced the vehicle's range. The reconstruction of the 149 AMX-30Es began in 1988, and these were designated AMX-30EM1s. In the early 1990s Spain received a large number of <a href="M60%20Patton">M60 Patton</a> tanks, replacing its fleet of M47s and M48s, as well as its AMX-30EM1s.

In the mid-1980s <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> approached Spain in an attempt to procure armaments for the modernization of its armed forces. Of the possible armaments for sale, Indonesia expressed interest in the procurement of the AMX-30. Although this deal fell through, in 2004 the Spanish and <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>n governments agreed on the sale of between 33 and 46 second-hand AMX-30EM2s, which had recently been replaced in the Spanish Army. However, the deal was canceled after <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Aznar">José María Aznar</a> was replaced by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Luis%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Zapatero">José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero</a> as prime minister of Spain—the new Spanish government declared that Spain didn't even have enough AMX-30EM2s in working condition to sell to Colombia.

Batman: Arkham Asylum

Batman: Arkham Asylum is a 2009 <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Rocksteady%20Studios">Rocksteady Studios</a> and published by <a href="Eidos%20Interactive">Eidos Interactive</a> in conjunction with <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Interactive%20Entertainment">Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment</a>. Based on the <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> superhero <a href="Batman">Batman</a>, and written by veteran "<a href="Batman%20%28comic%20book%29">Batman</a>" writer <a href="Paul%20Dini">Paul Dini</a>, "Arkham Asylum" is inspired by the long-running comic book mythos. In the game's main storyline, Batman's archenemy, the <a href="Joker%20%28comics%29">Joker</a>, instigates an elaborate plot to seize control of <a href="Arkham%20Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a> and trap Batman inside with many of his incarcerated foes. With Joker threatening to detonate hidden bombs around fictional <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a>, Batman is forced to fight his way through the asylum's inmates and put an end to the Joker's plans. Most of the game's leading characters are voiced by actors who have appeared in other media based on the <a href="DC%20animated%20universe">DC Animated Universe</a>; <a href="Kevin%20Conroy">Kevin Conroy</a>, <a href="Mark%20Hamill">Mark Hamill</a>, and <a href="Arleen%20Sorkin">Arleen Sorkin</a> reprised their roles as Batman, the Joker, and his sidekick <a href="Harley%20Quinn">Harley Quinn</a> respectively.

The game is presented from the <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Third-person%20view">third-person perspective</a> with a primary focus on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in combat and exploration. Batman can freely move around the Arkham Asylum facility, interacting with characters and undertaking missions, and unlocking new areas by progressing through the main story or obtaining new equipment. The player is able to complete side missions away from the main story to unlock additional content and collectible items. Combat focuses on chaining attacks together against numerous foes while avoiding damage, while stealth allows Batman to conceal himself around an area, using gadgets and the environment to silently eliminate enemies.

Development began at Rocksteady Studios in May 2007, with a 40-person team that expanded to 60 people by the project's conclusion after approximately 21 months. Among others, the game design was inspired by "Batman"-penned works of <a href="Neal%20Adams">Neal Adams</a> and <a href="Frank%20Miller%20%28comics%29">Frank Miller</a>, and <a href="Grant%20Morrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s "" graphic novel. Built on <a href="Unreal%20Engine%203">Unreal Engine 3</a>, "Arkham Asylum"s production underwent several variations, refining both gameplay such as the combat system, and the central story, resulting in the removal of plot elements and some of Batman's main enemies, who did not fit the tone of the rest of the game. Rocksteady began developing ideas for a sequel months before "Arkham Asylum"s completion, hiding hints to the sequel within the game.

"Arkham Asylum" was released worldwide for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> video game consoles on August 25, 2009, followed by a <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> version on September 15. The game received critical acclaimparticularly for its narrative and combat. Reviewers called it the "greatest comic book game of all time," and the "best superhero game of modern times." It won several awards, including "Best Action Adventure" game, "Best Game", and "Game of the Year" from different media outlets and held the <a href="Guinness%20World%20Record">Guinness World Record</a> for "Most Critically Acclaimed Superhero Game Ever" and has been cited as one of the <a href="greatest%20video%20games%20of%20all%20time">greatest video games of all time</a>. The game received several re-releases, including a <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a> edition in March 2010, a <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> version in November 2011, and a remastered version for <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> in October 2016. "Arkham Asylum"s success launched the "" series, containing video game sequels and spin-offs, comic books, merchandise, and movies, beginning in October 2011 with its direct sequel "".

"Batman: Arkham Asylum" is an <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a> viewed from the <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> perspective. The playable character is visible on the screen and the camera can be freely rotated around him. The player controls Batman as he traverses <a href="Arkham%20Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a>, a secure facility for the criminally insane located off the coast of <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a>. The opening areas of the game are linear, serving as a tutorial for the moves and approaches available to the player. Once the player emerges onto the island he can freely explore the game world, although some areas remain inaccessible until certain milestones in the main story. Batman can run, jump, climb, crouch, glide from heights using his cape, and use his <a href="grappling%20hook">grapple gun</a> to climb low structures or escape to higher ledges.

The player can use "Detective Vision"a visual mode which provides contextual information, tinting the game world blue and highlighting interactive objects like destructible walls and removable grates, the number of enemies in an area and their statussuch as their awareness of Batman's presenceand shows civilians and corpses. The mode is also used to follow footprints, investigate odors, and solve puzzles.

Batman has access to several gadgets which he can use to explore or fight. The <a href="batarang">batarang</a> is a throwing weapon that can temporarily stun enemies or trigger remote devices. A remotely controlled version can be steered once thrown, and the sonic batarang can be used to attract the attention of specific enemies wearing monitoring collars, or detonated to knock a nearby enemy unconscious. Explosive gel can be used on weak walls and floors, and can be remotely detonatedsending rubble crashing onto an enemy. The line launcher can be used to traverse horizontal spans. The Batclawa grappling devicecan be used to interact with remote objects such as vent covers or to grab enemies. The Cryptographic Sequencer is used to override security panels, open new paths, or disable various asylum functions. Some areas are inaccessible until Batman acquires the gadgets necessary to overcoming the obstacle. The player is encouraged to explore the game world away from the main game to find and solve riddles left by the <a href="Riddler">Riddler</a>who hacks into Batman's communication system to challenge him with riddles. Objects can be collected, and some of the Riddler's puzzles require the player to find areas related to the answer to a riddle and scan it with "Detective Vision". The game world has 240 collectable items, such as Riddler trophies, chattering Joker teeth, interview tapes with some of Arkham's inmates, and cryptic messages left in the asylum by its founder Amadeus Arkham that discuss the facility's bleak history. The player is rewarded for solving riddles and finding collectibles with experience points and additional game content, including challenge maps that test the player's skill at the game's combat system, character biographies, and in-game statues of "Arkham Asylum"s characters.

Players can traverse enemy-controlled areas using stealth or direct combat. The game's "Freeflow" combat uses three main buttons: attack, stun, and counter. The system lets Batman move quickly between enemies, chaining attacks together until all enemies are unconscious. <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">Combining</a> the three main abilities can keep Batman attacking while moving between enemies and avoiding being attacked himself. The more combo attacks that are chained together, the faster and more agile Batman becomes, and special attackssuch as a throw, grapple, and an instant takedown which can immediately defeat an enemybecome available. Combat is rewarded with experience points, which are used to unlock gadgets, combat moves, and health upgrades. Higher combos, a wider variety of moves, and avoiding damage delivers more points. Enemy attacks are preempted with a warning icon, which indicate the attack can be countered. Some enemies require different approaches to overcome; knife-wielding thugs must be stunned before they can be attacked, and others must be struck from behind. Some enemies are armed with guns which significantly damage Batman. Enemies react to Batman's elimination of their allies, which raises their fear level and alters their behavior; for example, they will adopt new patrol routes, requiring the player to adapt to the changing situation. During combat, Batman's health is diminished by attacks, but is fully restored once the battle ends.

The player can use predatory tactics through stealthincluding silent <a href="Takedown%20%28grappling%29">takedowns</a>, dropping from overhead perches and snatching enemies away, or using the explosive gel to knock foes off their feetto tilt the odds in their favor. Some areas feature sections that require the player to use these tactics to avoid alerting the Joker's henchmen and thus failing to meet an objective. Many areas feature stone gargoyles placed high above, helping Batman remain concealed. Batman can use his grapnel gun to reach the gargoyles, giving him a high vantage point over the area and the enemies. From the gargoyles, Batman can glide down to attack enemies or hang upside down from the gargoyles to grapple a nearby enemy and leave him tethered there. The player can use floor grates to attack from below, hide around corners, use batarangs to stun enemies from afar, and use the grapnel gun to pull enemies over ledges.

"Arkham Asylum" features a series of challenge maps separate from the game's story mode that are unlocked while playing, and others are available as optional <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC). The maps focus on the completion of specific goals, such as eliminating successive waves of enemies in combat, and subduing patrolling enemies while using stealth. The methods and variety of abilities used to achieve these goals earn an overall performance score that is ranked online against other players. On the PlayStation 3, the Joker is a playable character in the combat and stealth challenge maps via optional DLC; he must confront the asylum guards and police commissioner <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28comics%29">James Gordon</a>. The Joker has his own combat abilities and weapons, such as a handgun, exploding <a href="chattering%20teeth">chattering teeth</a>, and x-ray glasses which allow him to see opponents through walls.

On compatible systems, the Microsoft Windows version uses <a href="nVidia">nVidia</a>'s <a href="PhysX">PhysX</a> software engine to produce realistic, dynamic interactions with the game world. With PhysX enabled, some areas contain smoke or fog which reacts to Batman moving through it, while with PhysX disabled the fog will not appear at all. Other effects include dynamic interaction with paper and leaves, surfaces which can be scratched and chipped, and dynamic, destructible cloth elements such as banners and cobwebs. The "Game of the Year" version features the ability to play the game in 3D on any 2D television using <a href="Stereoscopy%23Color%20anaglyph%20systems">anaglyph 3D glasses</a>.

"Arkham Asylum" is set in the fictional Arkham Asylum, a facility on Arkham Island off the coast of Gotham City that houses criminally insane supervillains. The game features a large ensemble of characters from the history of "<a href="Batman%20%28comic%20book%29">Batman</a>" comics. Three voice actors, who worked on the <a href="DC%20Animated%20Universe">DC Animated Universe</a> series of film and television, reprised their roles for the game. <a href="Kevin%20Conroy">Kevin Conroy</a> voices Batmana superhero trained to the peak of human physical perfection and an expert in martial arts, <a href="Mark%20Hamill">Mark Hamill</a> voices Batman's psychopathic nemesis the Joker, and the Joker's sidekick <a href="Harley%20Quinn">Harley Quinn</a> is voiced by <a href="Arleen%20Sorkin">Arleen Sorkin</a>. Batman is aided by his allies <a href="Barbara%20Gordon">Oracle</a> (<a href="Kimberly%20Brooks">Kimberly Brooks</a>)who remotely provides him with intelligence, and police commissioner James Gordon (<a href="Tom%20Kane">Tom Kane</a>).

In the asylum, Batman is faced with several supervillains; he must defend himself from an enraged <a href="Bane%20%28comics%29">Bane</a> (<a href="Fred%20Tatasciore">Fred Tatasciore</a>), subdue indiscriminate serial killer <a href="Victor%20Zsasz">Victor Zsasz</a> (<a href="Danny%20Jacobs%20%28actor%29">Danny Jacobs</a>), confront the monstrous <a href="Killer%20Croc">Killer Croc</a> (<a href="Steve%20Blum">Steve Blum</a>), defeat the plant-controlling <a href="Poison%20Ivy%20%28comics%29">Poison Ivy</a> (<a href="Tasia%20Valenza">Tasia Valenza</a>), and battle his way through hallucinogen-induced nightmares created by the <a href="Scarecrow%20%28DC%20Comics%29">Scarecrow</a> (<a href="Dino%20Andrade">Dino Andrade</a>). The Riddler (<a href="Wally%20Wingert">Wally Wingert</a>) does not physically appear in the game, but communicates with Batman and challenges him to solve riddles placed around the island. Other characters appearing in the game include the asylum's warden <a href="Quincy%20Sharp">Quincy Sharp</a> (also voiced by Kane), Batman's parents Thomas and Martha Wayne (voiced by Conroy and Valenza respectively), and asylum guard Aaron Cash (Duane R Shepard, Sr). The shape-shifting <a href="Clayface">Clayface</a> appears in cameo, taking on the guise of other characters as he tries to trick the player into releasing him. The <a href="Mad%20Hatter%20%28comics%29">Mad Hatter</a> was almost included in the game, but the developers removed him. The body of <a href="Ra%27s%20al%20Ghul">Ra's al Ghul</a> is in the asylum's morgue and the <a href="Ventriloquist%20%28comics%29">Ventriloquist</a>s dummy, Scarface, appears several times in the story. Several other charactersincluding the <a href="Penguin%20%28comics%29">Penguin</a>, <a href="Creeper%20%28comics%29">Jack Ryder</a>, <a href="Mr.%20Freeze">Mr. Freeze</a>, <a href="Two-Face">Two-Face</a>, <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>, and the asylum's founder <a href="Amadeus%20Arkham">Amadeus Arkham</a>are referenced in the game, but do not appear in it.

After the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at <a href="Blackgate%20Penitentiary">Blackgate Prison</a>. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret <a href="Batcave">Batcave</a> installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.

There, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titana more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strengthintending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.

At the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.

Batman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Jokerwho is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a <a href="post-credits%20scene">post-credits scene</a>, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.

"Batman: Arkham Asylum" was first announced in August 2008; it was developed by British studio <a href="Rocksteady%20Studios">Rocksteady Studios</a> under the aegis of <a href="Eidos%20Interactive">Eidos Interactive</a> and <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Interactive%20Entertainment">Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment</a>. Eidos obtained the rights to make a Batman game in spring 2007, and approached then little-known Rocksteady after viewing the developer's prototype. At Eidos' request, Rocksteady presented their approach to the "Batman" license, and by May 2007, they had begun developing the game's concept, with full production beginning in September. Writer <a href="Paul%20Dini">Paul Dini</a> ("", "<a href="Detective%20Comics">Detective Comics</a>") was first approached by DC Comics around late 2007 about the prospect of creating a story for an original Batman video game. Dini found the idea intriguing, believing that few Batman games were based on an original idea, instead being adapted from film or television. DC Comics asked Dini what his approach to writing a new Batman film or graphic novel would be, but one that was designed for gameplay. He later met with the Rocksteady team, where it was decided that Dini's ideas were in line with what Rocksteady wanted to achieve. By the time Dini joined the project, Rocksteady were investigating the idea of setting the game within Arkham, and had produced preliminary designs depicting it as a huge estate on an island connected to mainland Gotham City by a bridge. The cast had not been finalized, but given the setting it was certain that the Joker would play a large role. The game and story were developed together, with the limitations of mechanics requiring the story to be built around them. The core aim was to make the game engaging enough for players to spend 8–10 hours completing it, especially those uninterested in Batman-franchised media. Rocksteady would guide Dini when they thought he was writing too much story or character motivation.

Among various <a href="Neal%20Adams">Neal Adams</a> and <a href="Frank%20Miller%20%28comics%29">Frank Miller</a>-penned "Batman" stories, <a href="Grant%20Morrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s "" was an inspiration for the game's design. Producer Nathan Burlow said the narrative and atmosphere of the 2007 game "<a href="BioShock">BioShock</a>" influenced "Arkham Asylum"s design. Director <a href="Sefton%20Hill">Sefton Hill</a> said the influences of the gadgets and abilities that can be combined and used in different ways from "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>" and "<a href="Metroid">Metroid</a>". The design team isolated the components that they felt made Batman, and exaggerated these elements. Design ideas which contradicted these facets of the character were dropped, and other elements of Batman, such as his refusal to kill his enemies, were strictly enforced, which provided additional challenges in allowing the player to have complete freedom in the game without transgressing on that fundamental aspect of the character. Arkham Asylum was chosen as the setting because it confined the player to an area containing several enemies, whereas in an open city setting he could receive help, return to the Batcave, or otherwise be able to distance himself from his opponents.

The development team wanted to include iconic aspects of the Batman mythos, and decided early on in production to have Conroy, Hamill, and Sorkin reprise their roles in Dini's "Batman: The Animated Series" as Batman, the Joker, and Harley Quinn, respectively. Hamill has thousands of lines of dialogue in the game, and Conroy has relatively few in comparison. After seeing character models of the Joker's "Arkham Asylum" appearance, Hamill decided to portray the character as dark and gritty while retaining a clownish and playful nature. Although the game features references to plot events in both "The Animated Series" and "Batman" comics, the story does not directly follow any singular story or depiction of the character.

The game took approximately 21 months to complete; Rocksteady began development with a team of 40, which had expanded to around 60 by the game's completion. Combat was considered one of the greatest challenges in developing the game; the system went through three iterations. Rocksteady originally developed the game's combat as a full rhythm action game. It was later set in 2D, which involved colored circles crashing into each other during fights; the final system was based on this 2D model. Combat was designed to be unique for Batman, and was given a simple control scheme to reflect the ease with which Batman can perform the moves. "Arkham Asylum" was built on <a href="Epic%20Games">Epic Games</a>' <a href="Unreal%20Engine%203">Unreal Engine 3</a>. Eidos president Ian Livingstone said one developer spent two years programming Batman's cape, using over 700 animations and sound effects to make it move realistically.

The developers intended to use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not care about the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman would find the Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a> and <a href="Batplane">Batwing</a>, were considered for inclusion in the game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have taken too much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.

Rocksteady began conceiving ideas for a possible sequel, which became "", approximately seven months before development of "Arkham Asylum" was completed. Rocksteady developed ideas for the sequel's story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected. A secret room containing hints, blueprints, and concept art for the next game was hidden in the asylum warden's office in "Arkham Asylum". The room remained hidden for six months following the game's release until Rocksteady revealed its presence. "Arkham Asylum"s musical score was composed by <a href="Ron%20Fish">Ron Fish</a> and Nick Arundel, who also composed the soundtrack for the sequel, "Batman: Arkham City".

To develop the game's overall aesthetic, the main aim was to create designs that would combine comic book style with realism. The environmental architecture and characters had to be extravagant enough to represent the "Batman" universe, but needed realistic texture and detail. The second aim was to recreate the dark, Gothic imagery inherent to the "Batman" universe, especially Arkham Asylum, so that the structure would feel as insane as those whom it houses. The asylum was considered an ideal location because it can house many of Batman's foes.

Batman's design was heavily influenced by the work of comic artist <a href="Jim%20Lee">Jim Lee</a>, who drew Batman as a strong, muscular character who could believably take part in extreme combat. His black and dark gray costume was based on modern versions, and has military influences and an industrial look. Approximately thirteen concept designs were produced before his final appearance took form. Artists avoided film interpretations of the Joker, partly because the developers only had access to the rights to the original Batman license. <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a>'s 1988 graphic novel "" influenced the character's design. Harley Quinn underwent a drastic redesign, removing her black and red full-body outfit and jester's hat, and replacing them with a costume with design elements from a nurse's outfit and a schoolgirl's uniform. <a href="WildStorm">WildStorm</a>, Lee's comic book publishing company, produced concept art for the game.

Designs for the asylum departed from comic interpretations of a large mansion and instead developed an entire island, with hints of <a href="Alcatraz%20Federal%20Penitentiary">Alcatraz prison</a>, composed of multiple buildings to allow for greater variety and exploration. Each building was designed with a different architectural style to make the facility appear believable and to imbue each location with a history. The medical building was inspired by Victorian architecture and its metalwork structure was intended to inspire feelings of horror. The intensive treatment unit has a Gothic, industrial aesthetic. The catacombs beneath the facility, inspired by early twentieth-century brickwork and Victorian industry, were meant to feel oppressive. The maximum security area was designed to feel claustrophobic and was retrofitted like a bunker, and the Arkham mansion displays a High Gothic style. The designers integrated crooked lines into environmental objects, such as trees and drainpipes, where possible. 40 rooms, 34 corridors, three exterior areas, and three Scarecrow-induced hallucination areas were designed for the game.

To bring these areas to life, the level designers produced game mechanic elements using simple room layouts and shapes, while concept artists worked in tandem to create artwork for each location, following the art direction. Environment artists would then build 3D layouts based on those designs. Finding an appropriate color palette for the game world was difficult; browns and monochromatic colors could depict the desired dark and moody atmosphere, but the developers wanted the aesthetic to resemble the vibrant color schemes of a comic book. To this end, they used saturated colors for in-game lighting. Lighting was an important component of the game, being used to highlight points of interest and to draw the player onward in otherwise boring corridors. To maintain the intended level of detail and allow the game's console versions to fit into the devices' memory, each area had to be streamed in and out of memory seamlessly to free up memory for textures and geometry. All of the cutscenes were storyboarded by Rocksteady artists, being visualized in the game engine before the character performances were motion-captured. The design team decided that cutscenes should be used to advance character relationships, and that after each cutscene the player should have had their goal changed or the importance of their actions modified. Priority was given to keeping action scenes under the player's control, rather than showing them in cutscenes.

"Batman: Arkham Asylum" was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in North America on August 25, 2009, and on August 28 in Europe and Australia. It was released for Microsoft Windows in North America on September 15, 2009, and on September 18 in Europe and Australia. A <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a> edition was released on March 26, 2010, in Europe and on May 11 in North America. <a href="Feral%20Interactive">Feral Interactive</a> developed a <a href="macOS">Mac OS X</a> version, which was released on disc and as a download on November 3, 2011. On the Windows version of the game, the developers used an anti-duplication measure that disables Batman's glide ability and causes other bugs, preventing copied games from progressing beyond a certain point. Although not the first game to implement such countermeasures, "Arkham Asylum" received media coverage, as this was seen as a novel method of copy protection.

A "Collector's Edition" containing the game, a replica of Batman's batarang, a behind-the-scenes DVD, a leather-bound 48-page book about Arkham's inmates, and a code to download the "Crime Alley" challenge map was released. Pre-ordering the game at some retailers allowed access to the "Dem Bones" challenge map. The Game of the Year version was initially announced for release only in Europe, Asia, and Australia, but a North American release was later added. The "Game of the Year" version includes the game, support for TriOviz 3D visual effects, two pairs of themed 3D glasses, and the six released DLC challenge mapstwo of which were omitted from the North American version.

"Batman: Return to Arkham", developed by <a href="Virtuos">Virtuos</a>, features remastered versions of "Arkham Asylum" and "Arkham City" using the Unreal Engine 4 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Additionally, both games include all previously released downloadable content, and feature improved graphics, upgraded models and environments, and improvements in the lighting, effects and shaders for both games. Originally intended for release in North America on July 26, 2016, and in Europe on July 29, 2016, the collection was delayed indefinitely in June 2016 in order to give the development team "additional time to deliver a polished "Batman Arkham" game experience." The collection was released on October 18, 2016.

In April 2009, it was announced that the Joker would be a downloadable playable character for use in the game's challenge maps exclusively for the PlayStation 3. Additional DLC packs were later released. The "Insane Night" pack, containing the "Totally Insane" combat and "Nocturnal Hunter" stealth challenge maps, was released on September 17, 2009. The "Prey in the Darkness" pack was released on September 23, 2009, and contains the "Heart of Darkness" combat and "Hothouse Prey" stealth challenge maps. In North America, the "Prey in the Darkness" pack was released exclusively for the PlayStation 3.

A demo version of the game was released via digital download for the PlayStation 3 on August 6, 2009, and for Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows on August 7. The PlayStation 3 version of "Arkham Asylum" unlocked a Batcave-themed virtual apartment for players on the social-gaming platform, <a href="PlayStation%20Home">PlayStation Home</a>. Additionally, North American game retailer <a href="GameStop">GameStop</a> ran a contest which allowed one winner to be rendered in-game as an Arkham inmate. A series of action figures based on character designs from the game were released through Warner Bros.' outlet <a href="DC%20Direct">DC Direct</a>.

"Batman: Arkham Asylum" received critical acclaim. Aggregating review website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gave the Xbox 360 version 92/100, the PlayStation 3 version 91/100, and the Microsoft Windows version 91/100. The game held the <a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Record</a> for "Most Critically Acclaimed Superhero Game Ever" based on an average Metacritic score of 91.67, until it was succeeded by "Arkham City".

"Arkham Asylum" was called one of the best comic book superhero games ever made. "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" magazine said it was "by some distance the best superhero game of modern times", <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Greg Miller called it "the greatest comic book game of all time", and <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Dan Whitehead called it "the best superhero game bar none", and wrote that it has "excellent visuals, a compelling story and superb voice acting." Whitehead also wrote, even without the iconic superhero, it would be a polished and engrossing game featuring compelling story and superb voice acting. "<a href="PSM3">PSM3</a>"s Andy Kelly wrote, "Rocksteady have struck the perfect balance of giving you the confident power of a superhero, but with enough weaknesses to make the game challenging; a remarkable feat of balancing and design". "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>"s Chris Kohler said that the game's strength lies in its tight script and masterful acting, making what could be a generic game captivating. <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>'s Thierry Nguyen gave the game an A−, stating that Rocksteady "manages to combine combat, stealth, storytelling, and cartoon voices into the best digital Batman simulator we've seen to date."

Several reviewers compared "Arkham Asylum" to other gamesincluding "BioShock" for its ability to deliver a unique adventure and establish a connection with the game world, and its innovative ideas; "The Legend of Zelda" for its adventuring style; "Metroid" for its world layout; and "<a href="Resident%20Evil">Resident Evil</a>" and "<a href="Tomb%20Raider">Tomb Raider</a>" for its classic action-adventuring that acts as a true hybrid of brawling, stealth, and platforming.

The game world's design and the game's attention to detail were well received by critics. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>"s Andrew Reiner said the game's setting had a taut and mesmerizing atmosphere, and was a place of wonder and inexplicable horror. Miller called it the right mix of creepy and cool, and appreciated the gradual damage reflected on Batman's suit as the story progressed, but said that pixelated CGI and lip synching issues diminished the presentation. Whitehead said that the impressive animation makes Batman feel alive, but wrote that the world itself was lifeless and lacking in interactive objects. He criticized segments in which character logic was sacrificed for video game tropes, citing repeated use of poison gas and electric floors as obstacles.

The combat system was well received for the simplicity of its implementation, allowing players to use it effectively without learning complex combinations of special moves, and the emphasis upon timing and flow to create fluid, graceful, and satisfyingly brutal attacks. Reviewers said that the combat remained challenging with the inclusion of more difficult-to-overcome enemies, and better use of combat was well incentivized without punishing those unable to master it. The design of stealth and the wide variety of methods available to disable enemy opponents were praised. "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" Andy Robinson wrote that it is a "thinking man's stealth game" that is the centerpiece of the game, and "Edge" said that the stealth offering was thrilling. Others wrote about the way in which enemies react with fear to the elimination of their allies, but some reviewers criticized the AI for allowing Batman to easily escape when discovered, and for being oblivious to Batman's presence. Whitehead said that stealth was not as directly rewarding as combat, citing difficulty in controlling Batman at close quarters and the inconsistent contextual actions.

"Arkham Asylum"s boss fights were criticized, with many reviewers labeling them as the game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player to learn and repeat monotonous routinessome of which, in the case of Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring and overly long, and the reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their <a href="fourth%20wall">fourth wall</a> manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and expectations, and meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against <a href="List%20of%20characters%20in%20the%20Metal%20Gear%20series%23Psycho%20Mantis">Psycho Mantis</a> in 1998's "<a href="Metal%20Gear%20Solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>", and 2002's "<a href="Eternal%20Darkness">Eternal Darkness</a>".

The main voice castincluding Conroy as Batman, Sorkin as Harley Quinn, Valenza as Poison Ivy, and Wingert as Riddlerwas well received, but Hamill's performance received consistent praise, with reviewers commenting upon his excellent inflection and timing on a cackling, maniacal performance that steals the show. Nguyen said that Dini and Hamill's Joker was the best depiction of the character outside of "The Killing Joke" and <a href="Heath%20Ledger">Heath Ledger</a>'s incarnation in "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20%28film%29">The Dark Knight</a>" (2008).

Worldwide, the game sold nearly two million units in its first three weeks of release, and had sold 2.5 million by the end of September 2009. According to <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>, "Batman: Arkham Asylum" sold approximately 593,000 units in North America during the five tracked days following its release on August 25. By December 2009, the PlayStation 3 version of the game had outsold the Xbox 360 version by approximately 10,000 units despite multi-platform titles typically selling better on the Xbox 360 at the time. The exclusive content featuring the Joker as a playable character was cited as a possible reason for the success of the PlayStation 3 version. The game took two of the top five spots on the US software chart in its first week of release, and topped the UK all-format chart for two weeks.

At the 2009 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, Rocksteady Studios won "Studio of the Year", while the game received nominations for "Best Action Adventure Game", "Best Graphics", "Best Voice" for Hamill and Sorkin, respectively, "Best Xbox 360 Game", and "Game of the Year".

"Arkham Asylum"s success launched a series of "Batman: Arkham" sequels, beginning in October 2011 with "Batman: Arkham City". Set one year after the events of "Arkham Asylum", it is the direct sequel to the earlier game. It was developed by Rocksteady Studios, and distributed by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Manipulated by Hugo Strange, Gotham City's mayor Quincy Sharp closes Arkham Asylum and Blackgate prison, and converts a section of the city's slums into an open air prison known as Arkham City, to house all of Gotham's criminals. While a wary Batman watches over the activities in Arkham City, the Joker is dying from his consumption of Titan. The sequel introduces several new charactersincluding Hugo Strange, <a href="Tim%20Drake">Robin</a>, Catwoman, Ra's al Ghul, and Mr. Freezeto the series. A limited, six-issue comic series, also titled ""bridging the plots of "Arkham Asylum" and "Arkham City"was written by Paul Dini and featured art by Carlos D'Anda. The first issue was released on May 11, 2011. A third installment of the "Arkham" series (not developed by Rocksteady), "", was released in October 2013, featuring a story set before the events of "Arkham Asylum". A narrative sequel to "Arkham City", "", was released on June 23, 2015 and is the series' concluding chapter.

Writer Grant Morrison said the game was the inspiration for his "<a href="Batman%20Incorporated">Batman Incorporated</a>" comic book. He said he wanted to "capture the feeling of the "Batman: Arkham Asylum" game ... When I played that game, it was the first time in my life where I actually felt what it is like to be Batman ...  We are now the heroes, and we can look through their eyes."

SS Pennsylvanian

SS "Pennsylvanian was a <a href="cargo%20ship">cargo ship</a> built in 1913 for the <a href="American-Hawaiian%20Steamship%20Company">American-Hawaiian Steamship Company</a>. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> she was requisitioned by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> as USS "Pennsylvanian" (ID-3511) in September 1918, and renamed two months later to USS "Scranton. After her naval service, her original name of "Pennsylvanian" was restored.

"Pennsylvanian" was built by the <a href="Maryland%20Steel%20Company">Maryland Steel Company</a> as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was employed in inter-coastal service via the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a> and the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> after it opened. "Pennsylvanian" was one of the first two steamships to travel eastbound through the canal when it opened in August 1914. During World War I, as both SS "Pennsylvanian" and USS "Scranton", the ship carried cargo and animals to France, and returned American troops after the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> in 1918.

After her naval service ended in 1919, she was returned to her original owners and resumed relatively uneventful cargo service over the next twenty years. Early in World War II, the ship was requisitioned by the <a href="War%20Shipping%20Administration">War Shipping Administration</a>, and shipped cargo on <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> – <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> routes and transatlantic routes. In mid-July 1944, "Pennsylvanian" was <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> as part of the <a href="breakwater%20%28structure%29">breakwater</a> for one of the <a href="Mulberry%20harbour">Mulberry artificial harbors</a> built to support the <a href="Normandy%20Invasion">Normandy Invasion</a>.

In September 1911, the <a href="American-Hawaiian%20Steamship%20Company">American-Hawaiian Steamship Company</a> placed an order with the <a href="Maryland%20Steel%20Company">Maryland Steel Company</a> of <a href="Sparrows%20Point%2C%20Maryland">Sparrows Point, Maryland</a>, for four new <a href="cargo%20ships">cargo ships</a>—, , , and "Pennsylvanian". The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, with a maximum cost of $640,000 each. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5% down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance. Provisions of the deal allowed that some of the nine installments could be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of "Pennsylvanian", including financing costs, was $70.35 per <a href="deadweight%20tonnage">deadweight ton</a>, which came out to just under $716,000.

"Pennsylvanian" (Maryland Steel yard no. 127) was the final ship built under the original contract. She was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 29 March 1913, and delivered to American-Hawaiian in June. "Pennsylvanian" was , and was in length and <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">abeam</a>. She had a <a href="deadweight%20tonnage">deadweight tonnage</a> of and a storage capacity of . "Pennsylvanian" had a single <a href="quadruple%20expansion%20steam%20engine">quadruple expansion steam engine</a> powered by oil-fired <a href="boiler">boiler</a>s that drove a single <a href="screw%20propeller">screw propeller</a>. It could propel the ship at a speed of . The engine had cylinders of 25½ <a href="inch">inch</a>es (65 <a href="centimetre">cm</a>), , 53½ inches (136 cm) and diameter by stroke. It was built by the Maryland Steel Company, Sparrows Point, Maryland.

When "Pennsylvanian" began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> ports via the Tehuantepec Route to <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> ports and <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at <a href="Mexico">Mexican</a> ports—<a href="Salina%20Cruz">Salina Cruz, Oaxaca</a>, for eastbound cargo, and <a href="Coatzacoalcos">Coatzacoalcos</a> for westbound cargo—and would traverse the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a> on the <a href="Tehuantepec%20National%20Railway">Tehuantepec National Railway</a>. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. "Pennsylvanian" sailed in this service on the west side of North America.

After the <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Veracruz">United States occupation of Veracruz</a> on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the <a href="Victoriano%20Huerta">Huerta</a>-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, coupled with the fact that the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the <a href="Straits%20of%20Magellan">Straits of Magellan</a>. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route. "Pennsylvanian", on the west side of the canal when it opened, was one of the first two eastbound steamers to traverse the canal during her trip to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>. In late August, American-Hawaiian announced that "Pennsylvanian" would sail on a <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> – Panama Canal – <a href="Boston">Boston</a> route, sailing opposite of , "Honolulan", and sister ship "Washingtonian". When landslides closed the canal in October 1915, all American-Hawaiian ships, including "Pennsylvanian", returned to the Straits of Magellan route again.

"Pennsylvanian"s exact movements during 1916 and 1917 are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was <a href="ship%20chartering">chartered</a> for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>s, cocoa, rubber, and <a href="manganese">manganese ore</a>. However, when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the entire American-Hawaiian fleet, including "Pennsylvanian", was requisitioned by the <a href="United%20States%20Shipping%20Board">United States Shipping Board</a> (), which then returned the ships for operation by American-Hawaiian.

On 13 September 1918, "Pennsylvanian" was transferred to the U.S. Navy at New York and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> USS "Pennsylvanian" (ID-3511) the same day. Assigned to the Navy's <a href="Naval%20Overseas%20Transportation%20Service">Naval Overseas Transportation Service</a> (), "Pennsylvanian" loaded a general cargo and sailed for <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>, France, on 30 September. She arrived there on 15 October and sailed for <a href="La%20Pallice%20%28harbour%29">La Pallice</a> the next day, where she unloaded her cargo before departing for New York on 5 November.
Arriving at New York on 15 November, four days after the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a>, "Pennsylvanian" was refitted as an animal transport ship, which, among other things, required the building of ramps and stalls for the animals. Sometime in November, probably during her refit, she was renamed USS "Scranton", becoming the first U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the <a href="Scranton%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania city</a>. "Scranton" sailed for France on 12 December, arriving at <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a> on 29 December, and returning to New York on 29 January 1919.

On 5 February, "Scranton" was transferred from the to the Navy's <a href="Cruiser%20and%20Transport%20Force">Cruiser and Transport Force</a>, and began conversion to a <a href="troop%20transport">troop transport</a> to carry American personnel home from France. While sailing to France to begin her first troop-carrying duties in late March, "Scranton" suffered damage to her <a href="rudder">rudder</a> and was disabled east of New York. Navy transport responded to "Scranton"s distress call, and attempted to take "Scranton" under tow. During the day on 28 March, "Scranton" attempted to run a towline to "El Sol" by sending a <a href="launch%20%28boat%29">launch</a> in the rolling seas, but it capsized, drowning three men. "El Sol" stood by "Scranton" for over 40 hours until minesweeper arrived and took "Scranton" under tow. "Penguin" and "Scranton" arrived in New York on 3 April, where "Scranton" entered <a href="drydock">drydock</a> to undergo repairs.
After repairs, "Scranton" made three roundtrips to France and carried some 6,000 troops and passengers home to the United States before she was decommissioned on 19 July. The ship was handed over to the for return to American-Hawaiian, who restored her original name.

"Pennsylvanian" resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, "Pennsylvanian" continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal in a relatively uneventful career. One incident of note occurred on 28 November 1930, when "Pennsylvanian" hit a <a href="Southern%20Pacific%20Company">Southern Pacific</a> ferry near <a href="Goat%20Island%20%28Yerba%20Buena%20Island%29">Goat Island</a> (present-day Yerba Buena Island) in a dense fog in <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>. "Pennsylvanian" hit the stern of the ferry and caused damage to the ferry's superstructure and destroyed about of the ferry's railing. No one on either ship was injured.

Other hints of "Pennsylvanian"s activities throughout the rest of her career can be found from contemporary newspaper reports. In October 1929, the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" reported on a shipment that included 2,500 to 3,000 radio sets among "Pennsylvanian"s of cargo. In March 1938, "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>" reported that "Pennsylvanian"s captain, C. M. Bamforth, had temporarily turned the deck of the cargo ship into a boatyard to build a <a href="catboat">catboat</a> for his son in <a href="Swampscott%2C%20Massachusetts">Swampscott, Massachusetts</a>. Bamforth <a href="keel%20laying">laid the keel</a> while in San Francisco, bought copper rivets for the <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> planking in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, and began painting the boat after "Pennsylvanian" had traversed the Panama Canal. He expected to have the boat finished when "Pennsylvanian" arrived in Boston on 22 April.
In October the same year, "Pennsylvanian" delivered of steel parts for the <a href="Hale%20Telescope">Hale Telescope</a> then under construction at the <a href="Palomar%20Observatory">Palomar Observatory</a> outside <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>. The ship had picked up the $375,000 cargo in Philadelphia before sailing for San Diego.

At some point after the United States entered World War II, "Pennsylvanian" was requisitioned by the <a href="War%20Shipping%20Administration">War Shipping Administration</a> (WSA), and, as with her pre-U.S. Navy service in World War I, she continued to be operated by American-Hawaiian. From July to September 1942, "Pennsylvanian" sailed between New York and Caribbean ports, calling at <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, <a href="Key%20West%2C%20Florida">Key West</a>, <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a>, <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay">Guantánamo Bay</a>, and <a href="Crist%C3%B3bal%2C%20Col%C3%B3n">Cristóbal</a>. In January 1943, "Pennsylvanian" called at <a href="Bandar%20Abbas">Bandar Abbas</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, on the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, and returned to Caribbean sailings again by March 1943.

Between May and September 1943, "Pennsylvanian" made four transatlantic crossings between New York and <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, making intermediate stops in <a href="Loch%20Ewe">Loch Ewe</a> and <a href="Methil%2C%20Fife">Methil</a> while in the United Kingdom. The cargo ship made two New York – Guantánamo Bay roundtrips between September and December before resuming transatlantic sailings. After two New York – Liverpool roundtrips between late December 1943 and April 1944, "Pennsylvanian" left the United States for the final time on 19 May 1944, arriving in Liverpool on 2 June. She called at the British ports of Methil, Loch Ewe, <a href="River%20Clyde">Clyde</a>, and <a href="Milford%20Haven">Milford Haven</a> in late June and early July, and, sailing from <a href="Barry%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan">Barry</a> in mid July, "Pennsylvanian" arrived at <a href="Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer">Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer</a>, France. There she was <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> as part of the <a href="breakwater%20%28structure%29">breakwater</a> for the <a href="Mulberry%20harbour">Mulberry artificial harbor</a> built to support the <a href="Normandy%20Invasion">Normandy Invasion</a>.

In March 1945, the WSA offered a payment of $565,910 to American-Hawaiian for "Pennsylvanian" as part of a $7.2 million settlement for eleven requisitioned American-Hawaiian ships that had either been sunk, scuttled, or were to be retained by the government.

Sea

The sea, the world ocean or simply the ocean is the connected <a href="body%20of%20water">body</a> of <a href="saline%20water">salty water</a> that covers over 70 percent of the Earth's surface. It moderates the Earth's climate and has important roles in the <a href="water%20cycle">water cycle</a>, <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a>, and <a href="nitrogen%20cycle">nitrogen cycle</a>. It has been travelled and explored since ancient times, while the scientific study of the sea—<a href="oceanography">oceanography</a>—dates broadly from the voyages of Captain <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> to explore the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> between 1768 and 1779. The word "sea" is also used to denote smaller, partly landlocked sections of the ocean and certain large, entirely landlocked, <a href="saltwater%20lake">saltwater lake</a>s such as the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> and the <a href="Dead%20Sea">Dead Sea</a>.

The most abundant solid dissolved in sea water is <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a>. The water also contains <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a>s of <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, and <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, amongst many other elements, some in minute concentrations. <a href="Salinity">Salinity</a> varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however the relative proportions of dissolved salts varies little across the <a href="ocean">ocean</a>s. Winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce <a href="wind%20wave">waves</a>, which <a href="breaking%20wave">break</a> when they enter shallow water. Winds also create surface currents through friction, setting up slow but stable circulations of water throughout the oceans. The directions of the circulation are governed by factors including the shapes of the continents and the rotation of the earth (the <a href="Coriolis%20effect">Coriolis effect</a>). Deep-sea currents, known as the <a href="thermohaline%20circulation">global conveyor belt</a>, carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean. <a href="Tide">Tide</a>s, the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by the rotation of the Earth and the gravitational effects of the orbiting Moon, and to a lesser extent of the Sun. Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries. Submarine <a href="earthquakes">earthquakes</a> arising from <a href="tectonic%20plate">tectonic plate</a> movements under the oceans can lead to destructive <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a>s, as can volcanoes, huge landslides or the impact of large <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s.

A wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, <a href="protists">protists</a>, algae, plants, fungi and animals, live in the sea, which offers a wide range of <a href="marine%20habitats">marine habitats</a> and <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s, ranging vertically from the sunlit surface waters and the shoreline to the enormous depths and pressures of the cold, dark <a href="abyssal%20zone">abyssal zone</a>, and in latitude from the cold waters under the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> ice to the colourful diversity of <a href="coral%20reefs">coral reefs</a> in tropical regions. Many of the major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and <a href="origin%20of%20life">life may have started</a> there.

The sea provides substantial supplies of food for humans, mainly <a href="fish">fish</a>, but also <a href="shellfish">shellfish</a>, <a href="marine%20mammal">mammals</a> and <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a>, whether caught by fishermen or <a href="aquaculture">farmed</a> underwater. Other human uses of the sea include <a href="shipping">trade</a>, travel, <a href="subsea%20%28technology%29">mineral extraction</a>, <a href="electricity%20generation">power generation</a>, <a href="naval%20warfare">warfare</a>, and leisure activities such as <a href="human%20swimming">swimming</a>, <a href="sailing">sailing</a>, and <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a>. Many of these activities create <a href="marine%20pollution">marine pollution</a>. The sea is important in human culture, with major appearances in literature at least since <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", in <a href="marine%20art">marine art</a>, in cinema, in theatre and in classical music. Symbolically, the sea appears as monsters such as <a href="Scylla">Scylla</a> in <a href="mythology">mythology</a> and represents the <a href="unconscious%20mind">unconscious mind</a> in <a href="dream%20interpretation">dream interpretation</a>.

The sea is the interconnected system of all the Earth's oceanic waters, including the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a>, <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>, <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian</a>, <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern</a> and <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>s. However, the word "sea" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> or the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>. There is no sharp distinction between seas and <a href="ocean">ocean</a>s, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as <a href="marginal%20sea">marginal sea</a>s) or wholly (as <a href="Inland%20sea%20%28geology%29">inland seas</a>) bordered by land. However, the <a href="Sargasso%20Sea">Sargasso Sea</a> has no coastline and lies within a circular current, the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Gyre">North Atlantic Gyre</a>. Seas are generally larger than lakes and contain salt water, but the <a href="Sea%20of%20Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a> is a <a href="freshwater%20lake">freshwater lake</a>. The <a href="United%20Nations%20Convention%20on%20the%20Law%20of%20the%20Sea">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a> states that all of the ocean is "sea".

<a href="Earth">Earth</a> is the only known <a href="planet">planet</a> with seas of liquid <a href="water">water</a> on its surface, although <a href="Mars">Mars</a> possesses <a href="Martian%20ice%20caps">ice caps</a> and <a href="Earth%20analog">similar planets</a> in <a href="extrasolar%20planet">other solar systems</a> may have oceans. It is still unclear <a href="Origin%20of%20water%20on%20Earth">where Earth's water came from</a>, but, seen from <a href="outer%20space">space</a>, our planet appears as a "<a href="The%20Blue%20Marble">blue marble</a>" of its various forms: oceans, ice caps, clouds. Earth's of sea contain <a href="Water%20distribution%20on%20Earth">about 97.2 percent of its known water</a> and cover more than 70 percent of its surface. Another 2.15% of Earth's water is frozen, found in the sea ice covering the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>, the ice cap covering <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> and its <a href="Southern%20Ocean">adjacent seas</a>, and various <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s and surface deposits around the world. The remainder (about 0.65% of the whole) form <a href="groundwater">underground reservoirs</a> or various stages of the <a href="%23the%20water%20cycle">water cycle</a>, containing the <a href="freshwater">freshwater</a> encountered and used by most <a href="terrestrial%20life">terrestrial life</a>: <a href="water%20vapor">vapor</a> in the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">air</a>, the <a href="cloud">cloud</a>s it slowly forms, the <a href="rain">rain</a> falling from them, and the <a href="lake">lake</a>s and <a href="river">river</a>s spontaneously formed as its waters flow again and again to the sea. The sea's dominance of the planet is such that the British author <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> once noted that "Earth" would have been better named "Ocean".

The <a href="science">scientific study</a> of <a href="water">water</a> and Earth's <a href="%23Water%20cycle">water cycle</a> is <a href="hydrology">hydrology</a>; <a href="hydrodynamics">hydrodynamics</a> studies the <a href="physics">physics</a> of water in motion. The more recent study of the sea in particular is <a href="oceanography">oceanography</a>. This began as the study of the shape of the ocean's <a href="%23currents">currents</a> but has since expanded into a large and <a href="multidisciplinary%20approach">multidisciplinary</a> field: it examines the properties of <a href="%23Seawater">seawater</a>; studies <a href="%23Waves">waves</a>, <a href="%23Tides">tides</a>, and <a href="%23Currents">currents</a>; charts <a href="%23Coasts">coastlines</a> and maps the <a href="%23Basins">seabeds</a>; and studies <a href="%23Marine%20life">marine life</a>. The subfield dealing with the sea's motion, its forces, and the forces acting upon it is known as <a href="physical%20oceanography">physical oceanography</a>. <a href="Marine%20biology">Marine biology</a> (biological oceanography) studies the <a href="%23Plants">plants</a>, <a href="%23Animals">animals</a>, and other organisms inhabiting <a href="%23Habitats">marine ecosystems</a>. Both are informed by <a href="chemical%20oceanography">chemical oceanography</a>, which studies the behavior of <a href="chemical%20elements">elements</a> and <a href="molecules">molecules</a> within the oceans: particularly, at the moment, the ocean's role in the <a href="%23The%20carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a> and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>'s role in the <a href="%23Acidification">increasing acidification</a> of seawater. Marine and maritime <a href="physical%20geography">geography</a> charts the shape and shaping of the sea, while <a href="marine%20geology">marine geology</a> (geological oceanography) has provided evidence of <a href="continental%20drift">continental drift</a> and the <a href="composition%20of%20the%20Earth">composition</a> and <a href="structure%20of%20the%20Earth">structure of the Earth</a>, clarified the process of <a href="sedimentation">sedimentation</a>, and assisted the study of <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a> and <a href="seismology">earthquakes</a>.

The water in the sea was thought to come from the Earth's <a href="volcano">volcano</a>es, starting 4 billion years ago, released by degassing from molten rock. More recent work suggests much of the Earth's water may come from <a href="comet">comet</a>s. A characteristic of seawater is that it is salty. Salinity is usually measured in parts per thousand (<a href="%E2%80%B0">‰</a> or per mil), and the open ocean has about solids per litre, a salinity of 35 ‰. The Mediterranean Sea is slightly higher at 38 ‰, while the salinity of the northern Red Sea can reach 41‰. The constituents of table salt, <a href="sodium">sodium</a> and <a href="chloride">chloride</a>, make up about 85 percent of the solids in solution, there are also other metal ions such as <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> and <a href="calcium">calcium</a> and negative ions including sulphate, carbonate, and bromide. Despite variations in the levels of salinity in different seas, the relative composition of the dissolved salts is stable throughout the world's oceans. Seawater is too saline for humans to drink safely, as the <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s cannot excrete urine as salty as seawater. In contrast, some landlocked <a href="hypersaline%20lake">hypersaline lake</a>s have a much higher salinity, for example the <a href="Dead%20Sea">Dead Sea</a> has dissolved solids per litre (300 ‰).
Although the amount of salt in the ocean remains relatively constant within the scale of millions of years, various factors affect the salinity of a body of water. Evaporation and by-product of ice formation (known as "brine rejection") increase salinity, whereas <a href="precipitation">precipitation</a>, sea ice melt, and runoff from land reduce it. The <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, for example, has many rivers flowing into it, and thus the sea could be considered as <a href="brackish">brackish</a>. Meanwhile, the Red Sea is very salty due to its high evaporation rate.

Sea temperature depends on the amount of solar radiation falling on its surface. In the tropics, with the sun nearly overhead, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over while near the poles the temperature in equilibrium with the sea ice is about . There is a continuous circulation of water in the oceans. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics, and the water becomes denser and sinks. The cold water moves back towards the equator as a deep sea current, driven by changes in the temperature and density of the water, before eventually welling up again towards the surface. Deep seawater has a temperature between and in all parts of the globe.

Seawater with a typical salinity of 35‰ has a freezing point of about −1.8 °C (28.8 °F). When its temperature becomes low enough, <a href="ice%20crystals">ice crystals</a> form on the surface. These break into small pieces and coalesce into flat discs that form a thick suspension known as <a href="frazil">frazil</a>. In calm conditions this freezes into a thin flat sheet known as <a href="nilas">nilas</a>, which thickens as new ice forms on its underside. In more turbulent seas, frazil crystals join together into flat discs known as pancakes. These slide under each other and coalesce to form <a href="Drift%20ice">floes</a>. In the process of freezing, salt water and air are trapped between the ice crystals. Nilas may have a salinity of 12–15 ‰, but by the time the <a href="sea%20ice">sea ice</a> is one year old, this falls to 4–6 ‰.

The amount of oxygen found in seawater depends primarily on the plants growing in it. These are mainly algae, including <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>, with some <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a>s such as <a href="seagrass">seagrass</a>es. In daylight the <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthetic activity</a> of these plants produces oxygen, which dissolves in the seawater and is used by marine animals. At night, photosynthesis stops, and the amount of dissolved oxygen declines. In the deep sea, where insufficient light penetrates for plants to grow, there is very little dissolved oxygen. In its absence, organic material is broken down by <a href="anaerobic%20organism">anaerobic</a> bacteria producing <a href="hydrogen%20sulphide">hydrogen sulphide</a>. Global warming is likely to reduce levels of oxygen in surface waters, since the solubility of oxygen in water falls at higher temperatures.
The amount of light that penetrates the sea depends on the angle of the sun, the weather conditions and the <a href="turbidity">turbidity</a> of the water. Much light gets reflected at the surface, and red light gets absorbed in the top few metres. Yellow and green light reach greater depths, and blue and violet light may penetrate as deep as . There is insufficient light for photosynthesis and plant growth beyond a depth of about .

Wind blowing over the surface of a body of water forms <a href="Wind%20wave">waves</a> that are perpendicular to the direction of the wind. The friction between air and water caused by a gentle breeze on a pond causes <a href="Capillary%20wave">ripples</a> to form. A strong blow over the ocean causes larger waves as the moving air pushes against the raised ridges of water. The waves reach their maximum height when the rate at which they are travelling nearly matches the speed of the wind. In open water, when the wind blows continuously as happens in the Southern Hemisphere in the <a href="Roaring%20Forties">Roaring Forties</a>, long, organised masses of water called <a href="Swell%20%28ocean%29">swell</a> roll across the ocean. If the wind dies down, the wave formation is reduced, but already-formed waves continue to travel in their original direction until they meet land. The size of the waves depends on the <a href="Fetch%20%28geography%29">fetch</a>, the distance that the wind has blown over the water and the strength and duration of that wind. When waves meet others coming from different directions, interference between the two can produce broken, irregular seas. <a href="Constructive%20interference">Constructive interference</a> can cause individual (unexpected) <a href="rogue%20wave">rogue wave</a>s much higher than normal. Most waves are less than high and it is not unusual for strong storms to double or triple that height; <a href="offshore%20construction">offshore construction</a> such as <a href="offshore%20wind%20farm">wind farms</a> and <a href="oil%20platform">oil platform</a>s use <a href="metocean">metocean</a> statistics from measurements in computing the wave forces (due to for instance the <a href="hundred-year%20wave">hundred-year wave</a>) they are designed against. Rogue waves, however, have been documented at heights above .

The top of a wave is known as the crest, the lowest point between waves is the trough and the distance between the crests is the wavelength. The wave is pushed across the surface of the sea by the wind, but this represents a transfer of energy and not a horizontal movement of water. As waves approach land and <a href="waves%20and%20shallow%20water">move into shallow water</a>, they change their behavior. If approaching at an angle, waves may bend (<a href="refraction">refraction</a>) or wrap rocks and headlands (<a href="diffraction">diffraction</a>). When the wave reaches a point where its deepest oscillations of the water contact the <a href="seabed">seabed</a>, they begin to slow down. This pulls the crests closer together and increases the <a href="wave%20height">waves' height</a>, which is called <a href="wave%20shoaling">wave shoaling</a>. When the ratio of the wave's height to the water depth increases above a certain limit, it "<a href="wave%20breaking">breaks</a>", toppling over in a mass of foaming water. This rushes in a sheet up the beach before retreating into the sea under the influence of gravity.

A tsunami is an unusual form of wave caused by an infrequent powerful event such as an underwater earthquake or landslide, a meteorite impact, a volcanic eruption or a collapse of land into the sea. These events can temporarily lift or lower the surface of the sea in the affected area, usually by a few feet. The potential energy of the displaced seawater is turned into kinetic energy, creating a shallow wave, a tsunami, radiating outwards at a velocity proportional to the square root of the depth of the water and which therefore travels much faster in the open ocean than on a continental shelf. In the deep open sea, tsunamis have wavelengths of around , travel at speeds of over 600 miles per hour (970 km/hr) and usually have a height of less than three feet, so they often pass unnoticed at this stage. In contrast, ocean surface waves caused by winds have wavelengths of a few hundred feet, travel at up to and are up to high.

A trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean. The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually, but is spread out over the wave front, so as the wave radiates away from the source, the front gets longer and the average energy reduces, so distant shores will, on average, be hit by weaker waves. However, as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth, it does not travel at the same speed in all directions, and this affects the direction of the wave front - an effect known as <a href="refraction">refraction</a> - which can focus the strength of the advancing tsunami on some areas and weaken it in others according to undersea topography.
As a tsunami <a href="Wave%20shoaling">moves into shallower water</a> its speed decreases, its wavelength shortens and its amplitude increases enormously, behaving in the same way as a wind-generated wave in shallow water, but on a vastly greater scale. Either the trough or the crest of a tsunami can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas close to the shore exposed which provides a useful warning for people on land. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, flooding all in its path. Much of the destruction may be caused by the flood water draining back into the sea after the tsunami has struck, dragging debris and people with it. Often several tsunami are caused by a single geological event and arrive at intervals of between eight minutes and two hours. The first wave to arrive on shore may not be the biggest or most destructive. Occasionally, a tsunami may transform into a <a href="Tidal%20bore">bore</a>, typically in a shallow bay or an estuary.

Wind blowing over the surface of the sea causes <a href="friction">friction</a> at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move in the same direction as the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a <a href="Ocean%20gyre">gyre</a> is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic and one in the Indian Ocean. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the <a href="topography">topography</a> of the land, the wind direction and the <a href="Coriolis%20effect">Coriolis effect</a>. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, and that flowing in the reverse direction has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and <a href="weather%20forecasting">weather forecasts</a> are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so <a href="global%20climate%20model">global climate model</a>ling makes use of <a href="List%20of%20ocean%20circulation%20models">ocean circulation models</a> as well as models of other major components such as the <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, land surfaces, aerosols and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, <a href="geophysical%20fluid%20dynamics">geophysical fluid dynamics</a>, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.
Surface currents only affect the top few hundred metres (yards) of the sea, but there are also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. A main deep ocean current flows through all the world's oceans and is known as the <a href="thermohaline%20circulation">thermohaline circulation</a> or global conveyor belt. This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature. At high latitudes the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out. Both these factors make it denser, and the water sinks. From the deep sea near Greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses on either side of the Atlantic. When it reaches the Antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface and loops back on itself. Some flows back into the Atlantic. It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed.

Besides gyres, there are temporary surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a <a href="Longshore%20drift">longshore current</a> is created as water is pushed along parallel to the coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach at right angles to the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach and the more oblique the wave approach, the stronger is the longshore current. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create <a href="Spit%20%28landform%29">spits</a> and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A <a href="rip%20current">rip current</a> can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a <a href="Shoal">sandbar</a> or near a man-made structure such as a <a href="groyne">groyne</a>. These strong currents can have a velocity of per second, can form at different places at different stages of the tide and can carry away unwary bathers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.

Tides are the regular rise and fall in water level experienced by seas and oceans in response to the <a href="Gravity">gravitational</a> influences of the Moon and the Sun, and the effects of the Earth's rotation. During each tidal cycle, at any given place the water rises to a maximum height known as "high tide" before ebbing away again to the minimum "low tide" level. As the water recedes, it uncovers more and more of the <a href="foreshore">foreshore</a>, also known as the intertidal zone. The difference in height between the high tide and low tide is known as the <a href="tidal%20range">tidal range</a> or tidal amplitude.

Most places experience two high tides each day, occurring at intervals of about 12 hours and 25 minutes. This is half the 24 hours and 50 minute period that it takes for the Earth to make a complete revolution and return the Moon to its previous position relative to an observer. The Moon's mass is some 27 million times smaller than the Sun, but it is 400 times closer to the Earth. <a href="Tidal%20force">Tidal force or tide-raising force</a> decreases rapidly with distance, so the moon has more than twice as great an effect on tides as the Sun. A bulge is formed in the ocean at the place where the Earth is closest to the Moon, because it is also where the effect of the Moon's gravity is stronger. On the opposite side of the Earth, the lunar force is at its weakest and this causes another bulge to form. As the Moon rotates around the Earth, so do these ocean bulges move around the Earth. The gravitational attraction of the Sun is also working on the seas, but its effect on tides is less powerful than that of the Moon, and when the Sun, Moon and Earth are all aligned (full moon and new moon), the combined effect results in the high "spring tides". In contrast, when the Sun is at 90° from the Moon as viewed from Earth, the combined gravitational effect on tides is less causing the lower "neap tides".

Tidal flows of seawater are resisted by the water's <a href="inertia">inertia</a> and can be affected by land masses. In places like the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> where land constrains the movement of the bulges, only one set of tides may occur each day. Inshore from an island there may be a complex daily cycle with four high tides. The island straits at <a href="Halkis">Chalkis</a> on <a href="Evvia">Euboea</a> experience strong currents which abruptly switch direction, generally four times per day but up to 12 times per day when the moon and the sun are 90 degrees apart. Where there is a funnel-shaped bay or estuary, the tidal range can be magnified. The <a href="Bay%20of%20Fundy">Bay of Fundy</a> is the classic example of this and can experience spring tides of . Although tides are regular and predictable, the height of high tides can be lowered by offshore winds and raised by onshore winds. The high pressure at the centre of an <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a>s pushes down on the water and is associated with abnormally low tides while <a href="low-pressure%20area">low-pressure area</a>s may cause extremely high tides. A <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> can occur when high winds pile water up against the coast in a shallow area and this, coupled with a low pressure system, can raise the surface of the sea at high tide dramatically. In 1900, <a href="Galveston%2C%20Texas">Galveston, Texas</a> experienced a surge during a <a href="1900%20Galveston%20hurricane">hurricane</a> that overwhelmed the city, killing over 3,500 people and destroying 3,636 homes.

The Earth is composed of a magnetic central <a href="Planetary%20core">core</a>, a mostly liquid <a href="Mantle%20%28geology%29">mantle</a> and a hard rigid outer shell (or <a href="lithosphere">lithosphere</a>), which is composed of the Earth's rocky <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29">crust</a> and the deeper mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. On land the crust is known as the <a href="continental%20crust">continental crust</a> while under the sea it is known as the <a href="oceanic%20crust">oceanic crust</a>. The latter is composed of relatively dense <a href="basalt">basalt</a> and is some five to ten kilometres (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of <a href="tectonic%20plates">tectonic plates</a>. In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form <a href="mid-oceanic%20ridge">mid-oceanic ridge</a>s and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as <a href="subduction">subduction</a>. Deep <a href="Oceanic%20trench">trenches</a> are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes, heat is produced and <a href="magma">magma</a> is forced up creating underwater mountains, some of which may form chains of volcanic islands near to deep trenches. Near some of the boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.

The Earth's deepest trench is the <a href="Mariana%20Trench">Mariana Trench</a> which extends for about across the seabed. It is near the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a>, a volcanic <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> in the West Pacific, and though it averages just wide, its deepest point is 10.994 kilometres (nearly 7 miles) below the surface of the sea. An even longer trench runs alongside the coast of Peru and Chile, reaching a depth of and extending for approximately . It occurs where the oceanic <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca Plate</a> slides under the continental <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American Plate</a> and is associated with the upthrust and volcanic activity of the Andes.

The zone where land meets sea is known as the <a href="coast">coast</a> and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by splashing waves is the <a href="shore">shore</a>. A <a href="beach">beach</a> is the accumulation of sand or <a href="Shingle%20beach">shingle</a> on the shore. A <a href="headland">headland</a> is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger <a href="promontory">promontory</a> is known as a <a href="Cape%20%28geography%29">cape</a>. The indentation of a coastline, especially between two headlands, is a <a href="bay">bay</a>, a small bay with a narrow inlet is a <a href="cove">cove</a> and a large bay may be referred to as a <a href="List%20of%20gulfs">gulf</a>. Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute and these are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves as the <a href="swash">swash</a> moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. This tends to undercut the cliff, and normal <a href="weathering">weathering</a> processes such as the action of frost follows, causing further destruction. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops at the foot of the cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.

Material worn from the margins of the land eventually ends up in the sea. Here it is subject to <a href="Attrition%20%28erosion%29">attrition</a> as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport sand and pebbles away from their place of origin. Sediment carried to the sea by rivers settles on the seabed causing <a href="River%20delta">delta</a>s to form in estuaries. All these materials move back and forth under the influence of waves, tides and currents. Dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. Governments make efforts to prevent flooding of the land by the building of <a href="Breakwater%20%28structure%29">breakwaters</a>, <a href="seawall">seawall</a>s, <a href="levee">dykes and levees</a> and other sea defences. For instance, the <a href="Thames%20Barrier">Thames Barrier</a> is designed to protect London from a storm surge, while the failure of the dykes and levees around <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> during <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> created a <a href="humanitarian%20crisis">humanitarian crisis</a> in the United States. <a href="Land%20reclamation%20in%20Hong%20Kong">Land reclamation in Hong Kong</a> also permitted the construction of <a href="Hong%20Kong%20International%20Airport">Hong Kong International Airport</a> through the leveling and expansion of two smaller islands.

Over most of geologic time, the sea level has been higher than it is today. The main factor affecting sea level over time is the result of changes in the oceanic crust, with a downward trend expected to continue in the very long term. At the <a href="last%20glacial%20maximum">last glacial maximum</a>, some 20,000 years ago, the sea level was below its present-day level. For at least the last 100 years, <a href="Current%20sea%20level%20rise">sea level has been rising</a> at an average rate of about per year. Most of this rise can be attributed to an increase in the temperature of the sea and the resulting slight thermal expansion of the upper of water. Additional contributions, as much as one quarter of the total, come from water sources on land, such as melting snow and glaciers and extraction of groundwater for irrigation and other agricultural and human needs. The rising trend from global warming is expected to continue until at least the end of the 21st century.

The sea plays a part in the <a href="water%20cycle">water or hydrological cycle</a>, in which water <a href="evaporation">evaporates</a> from the ocean, travels through the atmosphere as vapour, <a href="condensation">condenses</a>, falls as <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">rain or snow</a>, thereby sustaining life on land, and largely returns to the sea. Even in the <a href="Atacama%20Desert">Atacama Desert</a>, where little rain ever falls, dense clouds of fog known as the <a href="camanchaca">camanchaca</a> blow in from the sea and support plant life.

In central Asia and other large land masses, there are <a href="endorheic%20basin">endorheic basin</a>s which have no outlet to the sea, separated from the ocean by mountains or other natural geologic features that prevent the water draining away. The <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> is the largest one of these. Its main inflow is from the <a href="River%20Volga">River Volga</a>, there is no outflow and the evaporation of water makes it saline as dissolved minerals accumulate. The <a href="Aral%20Sea">Aral Sea</a> and <a href="Pyramid%20Lake%20%28Nevada%29">Pyramid Lake</a> in the western United States are further examples of large, inland saline water-bodies without drainage. Some endorheic lakes are less salty, but all are sensitive to variations in the quality of the inflowing water.

Oceans contain the greatest quantity of actively cycled carbon in the world and are second only to the <a href="lithosphere">lithosphere</a> in the amount of carbon they store. The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of <a href="dissolved%20organic%20carbon">dissolved organic carbon</a> that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of <a href="Total%20inorganic%20carbon">dissolved inorganic carbon</a> is about 15 percent higher than that of the surface layer and it remains there for much longer periods of time. <a href="Thermohaline%20circulation">Thermohaline circulation</a> exchanges carbon between these two layers.

Carbon enters the ocean as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolves in the surface layers and is converted into <a href="carbonic%20acid">carbonic acid</a>, <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a>, and <a href="bicarbonate">bicarbonate</a>: 

It can also enter through rivers as dissolved organic carbon and is converted by photosynthetic organisms into organic carbon. This can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the deeper, more carbon rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells and bones as <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>. It circulates in this layer for long periods of time before either being deposited as sediment or being returned to surface waters through thermohaline circulation.

Seawater is slightly <a href="alkalinity">alkaline</a> and had an average <a href="pH">pH</a> of about 8.2 over the past 300 million years. More recently, anthropogenic activities have steadily increased the <a href="%23The%20carbon%20cycle">carbon dioxide</a> content of the atmosphere; about 30–40% of the added CO is absorbed by the oceans, forming <a href="carbonic%20acid">carbonic acid</a> and lowering the pH (now below 8.1) through a process called ocean acidification. The pH is expected to reach 7.7 (representing a 3-fold increase in hydrogen ion concentration) by the year 2100, which is a significant change in a century.

One important element for the formation of <a href="skeleton">skeletal material</a> in marine animals is <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, but <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and <a href="skeletons">skeletons</a> dissolve below its <a href="carbonate%20compensation%20depth">compensation depth</a>. Calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected <a href="plankton">plankton</a>ic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as <a href="pteropod">pteropod</a>s, and single-celled <a href="algae">algae</a> called <a href="coccolithophorid">coccolithophorid</a>s and <a href="foraminifera">foraminifera</a>. All of these are important parts of the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a> and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, <a href="coral">coral</a>s are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other <a href="Coral%20reef">reef</a> dwellers.

The current rate of ocean chemistry change appears to be without precedent in Earth's geological history, making it unclear how well marine ecosystems will be able to adapt to the shifting conditions of the near future. Of particular concern is the manner in which the combination of acidification with the expected additional stressors of higher temperatures and <a href="anoxic%20event">lower oxygen levels</a> will impact the seas.

The oceans are home to a diverse collection of life forms that use it as a habitat. Since sunlight illuminates only the upper layers, the major part of the ocean exists in permanent darkness. As the different depth and temperature zones each provide habitat for a unique set of species, the marine environment as a whole encompasses an immense diversity of life. Marine habitats range from surface water to the deepest <a href="oceanic%20trench">oceanic trench</a>es, including coral reefs, <a href="kelp%20forest">kelp forest</a>s, <a href="seagrass%20meadow">seagrass meadow</a>s, <a href="tidepool">tidepool</a>s, muddy, sandy and rocky seabeds, and the open <a href="pelagic">pelagic</a> zone. The organisms living in the sea range from <a href="cetaceans">whales</a> 30 metres (100 ft) long to microscopic phytoplankton and <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a>, fungi, and bacteria. Marine life plays an important part in the <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a> as photosynthetic organisms convert dissolved carbon dioxide into organic carbon and it is economically important to humans for providing <a href="fishery">fish</a> for use as food.

Life may have originated in the sea and all the <a href="Phylum">major groups</a> of animals are represented there. Scientists differ as to precisely where in the sea life arose: the <a href="Miller-Urey">Miller-Urey</a> experiments suggested a dilute chemical "soup" in open water, but more recent suggestions include volcanic hot springs, fine-grained clay sediments, or deep-sea "<a href="black%20smoker">black smoker</a>" vents, all of which would have provided protection from damaging ultraviolet radiation which was not blocked by the early earth's atmosphere.

Marine habitats can be divided horizontally into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats extend from the shoreline to the edge of the <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a>. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided vertically into <a href="Pelagic%20zone">pelagic</a> (open water), <a href="Demersal%20zone">demersal</a> (just above the seabed) and <a href="Benthic%20zone">benthic</a> (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by <a href="latitude">latitude</a>: from polar seas with ice shelves, sea ice and icebergs, to temperate and tropical waters.

Coral reefs, the so-called "rainforests of the sea", occupy less than 0.1 percent of the world's ocean surface, yet their ecosystems include 25 percent of all marine species. The best-known are <a href="tropical">tropical</a> coral reefs such as Australia's <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a>, but cold water reefs harbour a wide array of species including corals (only six of which contribute to reef formation).

Marine <a href="primary%20producers">primary producers</a> — plants and microscopic organisms in the plankton — are widespread and very essential for the ecosystem. It has been estimated that half of the world's oxygen is produced by phytoplankton. About 45 percent of the sea's <a href="primary%20production">primary production</a> of living material is contributed by <a href="diatoms">diatoms</a>. Much larger algae, commonly known as <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a>s, are important locally; "Sargassum" forms floating drifts, while <a href="kelp">kelp</a> form seabed forests. <a href="Flowering%20plant">Flowering plant</a>s in the form of seagrasses grow in "<a href="meadow">meadow</a>s" in sandy shallows, <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s line the coast in tropical and subtropical regions and <a href="Halophyte">salt-tolerant</a> plants thrive in regularly inundated <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a>es. All of these habitats are able to sequester large quantities of carbon and support a <a href="Marine%20biology">biodiverse</a> range of larger and smaller animal life.

Light is only able to penetrate the top so this is the only part of the sea where plants can grow. The surface layers are often deficient in biologically active nitrogen compounds. The marine <a href="nitrogen%20cycle">nitrogen cycle</a> consists of complex microbial transformations which include the <a href="Nitrogen%20fixation">fixation of nitrogen</a>, its assimilation, <a href="nitrification">nitrification</a>, <a href="anammox">anammox</a> and denitrification. Some of these processes take place in deep water so that where there is an upwelling of cold waters, and also near estuaries where land-sourced nutrients are present, plant growth is higher. This means that the most productive areas, rich in plankton and therefore also in fish, are mainly coastal.

There is a broader spectrum of higher animal <a href="taxon">taxa</a> in the sea than on land, many marine species have yet to be discovered and the number known to science is expanding annually. Some <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s such as <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s, <a href="Pinniped">seals</a> and <a href="sea%20turtle">sea turtle</a>s return to the land to breed but fish, <a href="cetacean">cetacean</a>s and <a href="sea%20snake">sea snake</a>s have a completely aquatic lifestyle and many invertebrate <a href="Phylum">phyla</a> are entirely marine. In fact, the oceans teem with life and provide many varying microhabitats. One of these is the surface film which, even though tossed about by the movement of waves, provides a rich environment and is home to bacteria, <a href="Marine%20fungi">fungi</a>, <a href="microalgae">microalgae</a>, <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>, fish eggs and various larvae.

The pelagic zone contains <a href="Fauna%23Macrofauna">macro-</a> and <a href="microfauna">microfauna</a> and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents. Most of the smallest organisms are the larvae of fish and <a href="marine%20invertebrate">marine invertebrate</a>s which liberate <a href="Egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a> in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously sized fish and other <a href="nekton">nekton</a>ic organisms to large <a href="squid">squid</a>, <a href="shark">shark</a>s, <a href="porpoise">porpoise</a>s, <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>s and <a href="whale">whale</a>s. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to other regions of the ocean on a seasonal basis or vertical migrations daily, often ascending to feed at night and descending to safety by day. Ships can introduce or spread <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> through the discharge of <a href="ballast">ballast</a> water or the transport of organisms that have accumulated as part of the <a href="fouling%20community">fouling community</a> on the hulls of vessels.

The demersal zone supports many animals that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators and the seabed provides a range of habitats on or under the surface of the <a href="Substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a> which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions. The tidal zone with its periodic exposure to the dehydrating air is home to <a href="barnacle">barnacle</a>s, <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s and <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s. The <a href="neritic%20zone">neritic zone</a> has many organisms that need light to flourish. Here, among algal encrusted rocks live <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s, <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a>s, <a href="Polychaete">polychaete worms</a>, <a href="sea%20anemone">sea anemone</a>s and other invertebrates. Corals often contain photosynthetic <a href="Symbiosis">symbionts</a> and live in shallow waters where light penetrates. The extensive calcareous skeletons they extrude build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of the seabed. These provide a <a href="Biodiversity">biodiverse</a> habitat for reef dwelling organisms. There is less sea life on the floor of deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around <a href="seamount">seamount</a>s that rise from the depths, where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed. Close to the seabed live <a href="demersal%20fish">demersal fish</a> that feed largely on pelagic organisms or <a href="Benthos">benthic</a> invertebrates. Exploration of the deep sea by submersibles revealed a new world of creatures living on the seabed that scientists had not previously known to exist. Some like the <a href="Detritivore">detrivore</a>s rely on organic material falling to the ocean floor. Others cluster round deep sea <a href="hydrothermal%20vent">hydrothermal vent</a>s where mineral-rich flows of water emerge from the seabed, supporting communities whose primary producers are sulphide-oxidising <a href="chemoautotroph">chemoautotroph</a>ic bacteria, and whose consumers include specialised bivalves, sea anemones, barnacles, crabs, worms and fish, often found nowhere else. A dead whale sinking to the bottom of the ocean provides food for an assembly of organisms which similarly rely largely on the actions of sulphur-reducing bacteria. Such places support unique biomes where many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered.

Humans have <a href="Navigation">travelled</a> the seas since they first built sea-going craft. <a href="Ubaid%20period">Mesopotamians</a> were using <a href="bitumen%23ancient%20times">bitumen</a> to <a href="caulking">caulk</a> their <a href="reed%20boat%23History">reed boats</a> and, a little later, masted <a href="sail">sail</a>s. By c. 3000 BC, <a href="Austronesian%20people">Austronesians</a> on Taiwan had begun spreading into <a href="maritime%20Southeast%20Asia">maritime Southeast Asia</a>. Subsequently, the Austronesian "<a href="Lapita">Lapita</a>" peoples displayed great feats of navigation, reaching out from the <a href="Bismarck%20Archipelago">Bismarck Archipelago</a> to as far away as <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a>, and <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a>. Their descendants <a href="Polynesian%20navigation">continued to travel thousands of miles between tiny islands</a> on <a href="outrigger%20canoe%23History">outrigger canoes</a>, and in the process they found many new islands, including <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a> (Rapa Nui), and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>.

The <a href="Ancient%20Egyptians">Ancient Egyptians</a> and <a href="Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a> explored the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> and Red Sea with the Egyptian <a href="Hannu">Hannu</a> reaching the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a> and the African Coast around 2750 BC. In the 1st millennium BC, Phoenicians and Greeks established colonies throughout the Mediterranean and the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> Around 500 BC, the <a href="Carthage">Carthaginian</a> navigator <a href="Hanno%20the%20Navigator">Hanno</a> left a detailed <a href="periplus">periplus</a> of an Atlantic journey that reached at least <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a> and possibly <a href="Mount%20Cameroon">Mount Cameroon</a>. In the <a href="Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29">early Mediaeval period</a>, the <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a> crossed the <a href="North%20Atlantic">North Atlantic</a> and even reached the northeastern fringes of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. <a href="Novgorod%20Republic">Novgorodians</a> had also been sailing the <a href="White%20Sea">White Sea</a> since the 13th century or before. Meanwhile, the seas along the eastern and southern Asian coast were used by Arab and Chinese traders. The Chinese <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> had a fleet of 317 ships with 37,000 men under <a href="Zheng%20He">Zheng He</a> in the early fifteenth century, sailing the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the late fifteenth century, Western European mariners started making longer voyages of exploration in search of trade. <a href="Bartolomeu%20Dias">Bartolomeu Dias</a> rounded the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> in 1487 and <a href="Vasco%20da%20Gama">Vasco da Gama</a> reached India via the Cape in 1498. <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> sailed from <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a> in 1492, attempting to reach the eastern lands of India and Japan by the novel means of travelling westwards. He made landfall instead on an island in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> and a few years later, the Venetian navigator <a href="John%20Cabot">John Cabot</a> reached <a href="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>. The Italian <a href="Amerigo%20Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a>, after whom America was named, explored the South American coastline in voyages made between 1497 and 1502, discovering the mouth of the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon River</a>. In 1519 the <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> navigator <a href="Ferdinand%20Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a> led the first expedition to sail around the world.
As for the history of <a href="navigational%20instrument">navigational instrument</a>, a <a href="compass">compass</a> was first used by the ancient Greeks and Chinese to show where north lies and the direction in which the ship is heading. The latitude (an angle which ranges from 0° at the equator to 90° at the poles) was determined by measuring the angle between the Sun, Moon or a specific star and the horizon by the use of an <a href="astrolabe">astrolabe</a>, <a href="Jacob%27s%20staff">Jacob's staff</a> or <a href="Sextant%20%28astronomical%29">sextant</a>. The <a href="longitude">longitude</a> (a line on the globe joining the two poles) could only be calculated with an accurate <a href="Marine%20chronometer">chronometer</a> to show the exact time difference between the ship and a fixed point such as the <a href="Prime%20meridian%20%28Greenwich%29">Greenwich Meridian</a>. In 1759, <a href="John%20Harrison">John Harrison</a>, a clockmaker, designed such an instrument and James Cook used it in his voyages of exploration. Nowadays, the <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">Global Positioning System</a> (GPS) using over thirty satellites enables accurate navigation worldwide.

With regards to maps that are vital for navigation, in the second century, <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> mapped the whole known world from the "Fortunatae Insulae", <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> or <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>, eastward to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a>. This map was used in 1492 when Christopher Columbus set out on his voyages of discovery. Subsequently, <a href="Gerardus%20Mercator">Gerardus Mercator</a> made a practical map of the world in 1538, his map projection conveniently making <a href="rhumb%20lines">rhumb lines</a> straight. By the eighteenth century better maps had been made and part of the objective of <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> on his voyages was to further map the ocean. Scientific study has continued with the depth recordings of the "<a href="USS%20Tuscarora%20%281861%29">Tuscarora</a>", the oceanic research of the <a href="Challenger%20expedition">Challenger voyages</a> (1872–1876), the work of the Scandinavian seamen <a href="Roald%20Amundsen">Roald Amundsen</a> and <a href="Fridtjof%20Nansen">Fridtjof Nansen</a>, the <a href="Michael%20Sars">Michael Sars</a> expedition in 1910, the <a href="German%20Meteor%20expedition">German Meteor expedition</a> of 1925, the Antarctic survey work of "<a href="RRS%20Discovery%20II">Discovery II</a>" in 1932, and others since. Furthermore, in 1921, the <a href="International%20Hydrographic%20Organization">International Hydrographic Organization</a> was set up, and it constitutes the authority on <a href="Hydrography">hydrographic</a> surveying and nautical charting.

Scientific oceanography began with the voyages of Captain James Cook from 1768 to 1779, describing the Pacific with unprecedented precision from 71 degrees South to 71 degrees North. John Harrison's chronometers supported Cook's accurate navigation and charting on two of these voyages, permanently improving the standard attainable for subsequent work. Other expeditions followed in the nineteenth century, from Russia, France, the Netherlands and the United States as well as Britain. On <a href="HMS%20Beagle">HMS "Beagle"</a>, which provided <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> with ideas and materials for his 1859 book "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>", the ship's captain, <a href="Robert%20FitzRoy">Robert FitzRoy</a>, charted the seas and coasts and published his four-volume report of the ship's three voyages in 1839. <a href="Edward%20Forbes">Edward Forbes</a>'s 1854 book, "Distribution of Marine Life" argued that no life could exist below around 600 metres (2000 feet). This was proven wrong by the British biologists <a href="W.%20B.%20Carpenter">W. B. Carpenter</a> and <a href="C.%20Wyville%20Thomson">C. Wyville Thomson</a>, who in 1868 discovered life in deep water by dredging. Wyville Thompson became chief scientist on the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876, which effectively created the science of oceanography.

On her journey round the globe, "HMS Challenger" discovered about 4,700 new marine species, and made 492 deep sea soundings, 133 bottom dredges, 151 open water trawls and 263 serial water temperature observations. In the southern Atlantic in 1898/1899, <a href="Carl%20Chun">Carl Chun</a> on the "Valdivia" brought many new life forms to the surface from depths of over . The first observations of deep-sea animals in their natural environment were made in 1930 by <a href="William%20Beebe">William Beebe</a> and <a href="Otis%20Barton">Otis Barton</a> who descended to in the spherical steel <a href="Bathysphere">Bathysphere</a>. This was lowered by cable but by 1960 a self-powered submersible, <a href="Bathyscaphe%20Trieste">Trieste</a> developed by <a href="Jacques%20Piccard">Jacques Piccard</a>, took Piccard and <a href="Don%20Walsh">Don Walsh</a> to the deepest part of the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s oceans, the <a href="Mariana%20Trench">Mariana Trench</a> in the Pacific, reaching a record depth of about , a feat not repeated until 2012 when <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a> piloted the <a href="Deepsea%20Challenger">Deepsea Challenger</a> to similar depths. An <a href="atmospheric%20diving%20suit">atmospheric diving suit</a> can be worn for deep sea operations, with a new world record being set in 2006 when a US Navy diver descended to in one of these articulated, pressurized suits.

At great depths, no light penetrates through the water layers from above and the pressure is extreme. For deep sea exploration it is necessary to use specialist vehicles, either <a href="remotely%20operated%20underwater%20vehicle">remotely operated underwater vehicle</a>s with lights and cameras or manned <a href="submersible">submersible</a>s. The battery-operated <a href="Mir%20%28submersible%29">Mir submersibles</a> have a three-man crew and can descend to 20,000 feet (6,000 m). They have viewing ports, 5,000-watt lights, video equipment and manipulator arms for collecting samples, placing probes or pushing the vehicle across the sea bed when the thrusters would stir up excessive sediment.

<a href="Bathymetry">Bathymetry</a> is the mapping and study of the <a href="topography">topography</a> of the ocean floor. Methods used for measuring the depth of the sea include single or multibeam <a href="echosounder">echosounder</a>s, <a href="laser%20airborne%20depth%20sounder">laser airborne depth sounder</a>s and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. This information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries.

Ongoing oceanographic research includes marine lifeforms, conservation, the marine environment, the chemistry of the ocean, the studying and modelling of climate dynamics, the air-sea boundary, weather patterns, ocean resources, renewable energy, waves and currents, and the design and development of new tools and technologies for investigating the deep. Whereas in the 1960s and 1970s research could focus on taxonomy and basic biology, in the 2010s attention has shifted to larger topics such as climate change. Researchers make use of satellite-based <a href="remote%20sensing">remote sensing</a> for surface waters, with research ships, moored observatories and autonomous underwater vehicles to study and monitor all parts of the sea.

"Freedom of the seas" is a principle in <a href="international%20law">international law</a> dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in <a href="international%20waters">international waters</a>. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: "The high seas are open to all <a href="sovereign%20state">states</a>, whether coastal or <a href="landlocked%20country">land-locked</a>." Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of <a href="submarine%20communications%20cable">submarine cables</a>, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the <a href="International%20Maritime%20Organization">International Maritime Organization</a>. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.

UNCLOS defines various areas of water. "Internal waters" are on the landward side of a <a href="Baseline%20%28sea%29">baseline</a> and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. "Territorial waters" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A "contiguous zone" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for <a href="hot%20pursuit">hot pursuit</a> of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An "exclusive economic zone" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The "continental shelf" is the <a href="natural%20prolongation">natural prolongation</a> of the land territory to the <a href="continental%20margin">continental margin</a>'s outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. Here the coastal nation has the exclusive right to harvest minerals and also living resources "attached" to the seabed.

Control of the sea is important to the security of a maritime nation, and the naval <a href="blockade">blockade</a> of a port can be used to cut off food and supplies in time of war. Battles have been fought on the sea for more than 3,000 years. In about 1210 B.C., <a href="Suppiluliuma%20II">Suppiluliuma II</a>, the king of the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a>, defeated and burned a fleet from <a href="Alashiya">Alashiya</a> (modern <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>). In the decisive 480 B.C. <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis">Battle of Salamis</a>, the Greek general <a href="Themistocles">Themistocles</a> trapped the far larger fleet of the Persian king <a href="Xerxes%20II%20of%20Persia">Xerxes</a> in a narrow channel and attacked vigorously, destroying 200 Persian ships for the loss of 40 Greek vessels. At the end of the <a href="Age%20of%20Sail">Age of Sail</a>, the English navy, led by <a href="Horatio%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>, broke the power of the combined French and Spanish fleets at the 1805 <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>.

With steam and the industrial production of steel plate came greatly increased firepower in the shape of the <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> <a href="battleships">battleships</a> armed with long-range guns. In 1905, the Japanese fleet decisively defeated the Russian fleet, which had travelled over , at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a>. Dreadnoughts fought inconclusively in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> at the 1916 <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> between the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> and the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>'s <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. In the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the British victory at the 1940 <a href="Battle%20of%20Taranto">Battle of Taranto</a> showed that naval air power was sufficient to overcome the largest warships, foreshadowing the decisive sea-battles of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> including the Battles of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Midway</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Philippine%20Sea">the Philippine Sea</a>, and the climactic <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>, in all of which the dominant ships were <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s.

Submarines became important in naval warfare in World War I, when German submarines, known as <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s, sank nearly 5,000 Allied merchant ships, including however the <a href="RMS%20Lusitania">RMS Lusitania</a>, so helping to bring the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> into the war. In World War II, almost 3,000 Allied ships were sunk by U-boats attempting to block the flow of supplies to Britain, but the Allies broke the blockade in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a>, which lasted the whole length of the war, sinking 783 U-boats. Since 1960, several nations have maintained fleets of nuclear-powered <a href="ballistic%20missile%20submarine">ballistic missile submarine</a>s, vessels equipped to launch <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a>s with <a href="nuclear%20warhead">nuclear warhead</a>s from under the sea. Some of these are kept permanently on patrol.

Sailing ships or <a href="Packet%20boat">packets</a> carried mail overseas, one of the earliest being the Dutch service to <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> in the 1670s. These added passenger accommodation, but in cramped conditions. Later, scheduled services were offered but the time journeys took depended much on the weather. When steamships replaced sailing vessels, <a href="Ocean%20liner">ocean-going liners</a> took over the task of carrying people. By the beginning of the twentieth century, crossing the Atlantic took about five days and shipping companies competed to own the largest and fastest vessels. The <a href="Blue%20Riband">Blue Riband</a> was an unofficial accolade given to the fastest liner crossing the Atlantic in regular service. The "<a href="RMS%20Mauretania%20%281906%29">Mauretania</a>" held the title with 26.06 knots (48.26 km/h) for twenty years from 1909. The Hales Trophy, another award for the fastest commercial crossing of the Atlantic, was won by the "<a href="SS%20United%20States">United States</a>" in 1952 for a crossing that took three days, ten hours and forty minutes.

The great liners were comfortable but expensive in fuel and staff. The age of the trans-Atlantic liners waned as cheap intercontinental flights became available. In 1958, a regular scheduled air service between New York and Paris taking seven hours doomed the Atlantic ferry service to oblivion. One by one the vessels were laid up, some were scrapped, others became cruise ships for the leisure industry and still others floating hotels. The sea is still a route by which <a href="Refugees%23Boat%20people">boat people</a> travel in small, sometimes unseaworthy craft, often having paid money to <a href="People%20smuggling">people smugglers</a> for their passage. Some may be fleeing persecution but most are <a href="economic%20migrant">economic migrant</a>s attempting to reach countries where they believe their prospects are brighter.

Maritime trade has existed for millennia. The <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a> had developed trade with India using the Red Sea ports and in the first millennium BC the <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a>, Phoenicians, <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> and <a href="India">India</a>ns traded in luxury goods such as spices, gold, and precious stones. The Phoenicians were noted sea traders and under the Greeks and Romans, commerce continued to thrive. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, European trade dwindled but it continued to flourish among the kingdoms of Africa, the Middle East, India, China and southeastern Asia. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, about 13 million people were shipped across the Atlantic to be sold as slaves in the Americas.

Nowadays, large quantities of goods are transported by sea, especially across the Atlantic and around the Pacific Rim. A major trade route passes through the <a href="Pillars%20of%20Hercules">Pillars of Hercules</a>, across the Mediterranean and the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> to the Indian Ocean and through the <a href="Straits%20of%20Malacca">Straits of Malacca</a>; much trade also passes through the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. <a href="Shipping%20lane">Shipping lane</a>s are the routes on the open sea used by cargo vessels, traditionally making use of trade winds and currents. Over 60 percent of the world's container traffic is conveyed on the top twenty trade routes. Increased melting of Arctic ice since 2007 enables ships to travel the <a href="Northwest%20Passage">Northwest Passage</a> for some weeks in summertime, avoiding the longer routes via the Suez Canal or the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>.
Shipping is supplemented by <a href="air%20freight">air freight</a>, a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or perishable cargoes. Seaborne trade carries more than US$4 trillion worth of goods each year.

There are two main kinds of freight, <a href="bulk%20cargo">bulk cargo</a> and <a href="break%20bulk%20cargo">break bulk</a> or general cargo, most of which is now transported in <a href="Containerization">containers</a>. <a href="Commodity">Commodities</a> in the form of liquids, powder or particles are carried loose in the <a href="Hold%20%28ship%29">holds</a> of <a href="bulk%20carrier">bulk carrier</a>s and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on <a href="pallet">pallet</a>s. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built <a href="container%20ship">container ship</a>s at dedicated terminals. <a href="Freight%20forwarder">Freight forwarding</a> firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation.

Fish and other fishery products are among the most important sources of protein and other nutrients that are essential for a balanced diet and good health. In 2009, 16.6% of the world's intake of animal protein and 6.5% of all protein consumed came from fish. In order to fulfill this need, coastal countries have exploited marine resources in their <a href="exclusive%20economic%20zone">exclusive economic zone</a>, although fishing vessels are increasingly venturing further afield to exploit stocks in international waters. In 2011, the total world production of fish, including <a href="aquaculture">aquaculture</a>, was estimated to be 154 million tonnes, of which most was for human consumption. The harvesting of wild fish accounted for 90.4 million tonnes, while annually increasing aquaculture contributes the rest. The north west Pacific is by far the most productive area with 20.9 million tonnes (27 percent of the global marine catch) in 2010. In addition, the number of fishing vessels in 2010 reached 4.36 million, whereas the number of people employed in the primary sector of fish production in the same year amounted to 54.8 million.

Modern fishing vessels include <a href="fishing%20trawler">fishing trawler</a>s with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels and large <a href="factory%20ship">factory ship</a>s which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be <a href="purse%20seine">purse seine</a>s, other <a href="seine">seine</a>s, <a href="Trawling">trawls</a>, dredges, <a href="gillnet">gillnet</a>s and <a href="Longline%20fishing">long-lines</a> and the fish species most frequently targeted are <a href="herring">herring</a>, <a href="cod">cod</a>, <a href="anchovy">anchovy</a>, <a href="tuna">tuna</a>, <a href="flounder">flounder</a>, <a href="Mullet%20%28fish%29">mullet</a>, squid and <a href="salmon">salmon</a>. Overexploitation itself has become a serious concern; it does not only cause the depletion of fish stocks, but also substantially reduce the population of predatory fish populations. Myers & Wworm estimated that "industrialized fisheries typically reduced community biomass by 80% within 15 years of exploitation." In order to avoid overexploitation, many countries have introduced <a href="Individual%20fishing%20quota">quotas</a> in their own waters. However, recovery efforts often entail substantial costs to local economies or food provision. Nonetheless, research published in "Nature" in April 2018 found that the aggressive effort of the Indonesian <a href="Minister%20of%20Maritime%20Affairs%20and%20Fisheries%20of%20Indonesia">Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of Indonesia</a> <a href="Susi%20Pudjiastuti">Susi Pudjiastuti</a> to curtail illegal fishing has "reduced total fishing effort by at least 25%, (...) [potentially] generate a 14% increase in catch and a 12% increase in profit." Therefore, the paper concluded that "many nations can recover their fisheries while avoiding these short-term costs by sharply addressing illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing."
<a href="Artisan%20fishing">Artisan fishing</a> methods include rod and line, harpoons, skin diving, traps, throw nets and drag nets. Traditional fishing boats are powered by paddle, wind or outboard motors and operate in near-shore waters. The <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.

As well as the wild stock, about 79 million tonnes (78M long tons; 87M short tons) of food and non-food products were produced by aquaculture in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species of plants and animals were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included <a href="finfish">finfish</a>, aquatic <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s, crustaceans, molluscs, <a href="sea%20cucumber">sea cucumber</a>s, <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s, sea squirts and jellyfish. Integrated <a href="mariculture">mariculture</a> has the advantage that there is a readily available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. <a href="Marine%20shrimp%20farming">Shrimps</a> can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised <a href="lobster">lobster</a> <a href="larva">larva</a>e for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in <a href="Maine">Maine</a>. At least 145 species of seaweed – red, green, and brown algae – are eaten worldwide, and some have long been farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional <a href="algaculture">algaculture</a>. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is <a href="marsh%20samphire">marsh samphire</a> which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread <a href="Fish%20diseases%20and%20parasites">disease</a>. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed <a href="Farrer%27s%20scallop">Farrer's scallop</a> and <a href="Chinese%20white%20shrimp">white shrimp</a> and required their replacement by other species. Aquaculture is also associated with environmental risks; for instance, <a href="shrimp%20farm">shrimp farm</a>ing has caused the destruction of important <a href="mangrove%20forest">mangrove forest</a>s throughout <a href="southeast%20Asia">southeast Asia</a>.

Use of the sea for leisure developed in the nineteenth century, and became a significant industry in the twentieth century. Maritime leisure activities are varied, and include self-organized trips <a href="Cruising%20%28maritime%29">cruising</a>, <a href="yachting">yachting</a>, <a href="Offshore%20powerboat%20racing">powerboat racing</a> and <a href="Recreational%20boat%20fishing">fishing</a>; commercially organized voyages on <a href="cruise%20ships">cruise ships</a>; and trips on smaller vessels for <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a> such as <a href="whale%20watching">whale watching</a> and coastal <a href="birdwatching">birdwatching</a>.
Humans enjoy venturing into the sea; children paddle and splash in the shallows and many people take pleasure in <a href="Human%20swimming">bathing</a> and relaxing on the beach. This was not always the case, with <a href="sea%20bathing">sea bathing</a> becoming the vogue in Europe in the 18th century after <a href="William%20Buchan%20%28physician%29">Dr. William Buchan</a> advocated the practice for health reasons. <a href="Surfing">Surfing</a> is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer, with or without a <a href="surfboard">surfboard</a>. Other marine <a href="Surface%20water%20sports">water sports</a> include <a href="kite%20surfing">kite surfing</a>, where a <a href="power%20kite">power kite</a> propels a manned board across the water, <a href="windsurfing">windsurfing</a>, where the power is provided by a fixed, manoeuvrable sail and <a href="water%20skiing">water skiing</a>, where a <a href="powerboat">powerboat</a> is used to pull a skier.

Beneath the surface, <a href="freediving">freediving</a> is necessarily restricted to shallow descents. <a href="Pearl%20hunting">Pearl divers</a> have traditionally greased their skins, put cotton in their ears and clips on their noses and dived to with baskets to collect <a href="oyster">oyster</a>s. Human eyes are not adapted for use underwater but vision can be improved by wearing a <a href="diving%20mask">diving mask</a>. Other useful equipment includes <a href="Swimfin">fins</a> and <a href="Snorkel%20%28swimming%29">snorkels</a>, and <a href="Scuba%20set">scuba equipment</a> allows underwater breathing and hence a longer time can be spent beneath the surface. The depths that can be reached by divers and the length of time they can stay underwater is limited by the increase of pressure they experience as they descend and the need to prevent <a href="decompression%20sickness">decompression sickness</a> as they return to the surface. Recreational divers are advised to restrict themselves to depths of beyond which the danger of <a href="nitrogen%20narcosis">nitrogen narcosis</a> increases. <a href="Deep%20diving">Deeper dives</a> can be made with specialised equipment and training.

The sea offers a very large supply of <a href="energy">energy</a> carried by <a href="ocean%20wave">ocean wave</a>s, <a href="tide">tide</a>s, <a href="salinity">salinity</a> differences, and <a href="ocean%20thermal%20energy">ocean temperature differences</a> which can be harnessed to <a href="electricity%20generation">generate electricity</a>. Forms of '<a href="Green%20energy">green</a>' marine energy include <a href="tidal%20power">tidal power</a>, <a href="marine%20current%20power">marine current power</a>, <a href="osmotic%20power">osmotic power</a>, <a href="ocean%20thermal%20energy%20conversion">ocean thermal energy</a> and <a href="wave%20power">wave power</a>.
Tidal power uses generators to produce electricity from tidal flows, sometimes by using a dam to store and then release seawater. The Rance barrage, long, near <a href="St%20Malo">St Malo</a> in <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> opened in 1967; it generates about 0.5 GW, but it has been followed by few similar schemes.

The large and highly variable energy of waves gives them enormous destructive capability, making affordable and reliable wave machines problematic to develop. A small 2 MW commercial wave power plant, "Osprey", was built in Northern Scotland in 1995 about 300 metres (1000 ft) offshore. It was soon damaged by waves, then destroyed by a storm. Marine current power could provide populated areas close to the sea with a significant part of their energy needs. In principle, it could be harnessed by <a href="tidal%20stream%20generator">open-flow turbines</a>; sea bed systems are available, but limited to a depth of about .

<a href="Offshore%20wind%20power">Offshore wind power</a> is captured by <a href="wind%20turbine">wind turbine</a>s placed out at sea; it has the advantage that wind speeds are higher than on land, though wind farms are more costly to construct offshore. The first offshore wind farm was installed in <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> in 1991, and the installed capacity of European offshore wind farms reached 3 GW in 2010.

Electricity <a href="power%20station">power station</a>s are often located on the coast or beside an estuary so that the sea can be used as a heat sink. A colder heat sink enables more efficient power generation, which is important for expensive <a href="Nuclear%20power">nuclear power plants</a> in particular.

The seabed contains enormous reserves of minerals which can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialised <a href="shipyard">shipyard</a>s and <a href="infrastructure">infrastructure</a> costs are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up and the washing away of <a href="Spoil%20tip">spoil heaps</a>. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage.

<a href="Seafloor%20massive%20sulfide%20deposits">Seafloor massive sulphide deposits</a> are potential sources of <a href="silver">silver</a>, <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a> and <a href="zinc">zinc</a> and trace metals since their discovery in the 1960s. They form when <a href="Geothermal%20gradient">geothermally</a> heated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as "black smokers". The ores are of high quality but prohibitively costly to extract. Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> using <a href="robot">robot</a>ic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.

There are large deposits of <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a>, as oil and <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>, in rocks beneath the seabed. <a href="Oil%20platform">Offshore platforms</a> and <a href="drilling%20rig">drilling rig</a>s <a href="Offshore%20drilling">extract</a> the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by <a href="seismic%20wave">seismic wave</a>s used to locate deposits, probably causing the <a href="Beached%20whale">beaching of whales</a>. Toxic substances such as <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>, lead and <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage, and oil may be spilt.

Large quantities of <a href="methane%20clathrate">methane clathrate</a> exist on the seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around and these are of interest as a potential energy source. Some estimates put the amount available at between one and 5 million cubic kilometres (0.24 to 1.2 million cubic miles). Also on the seabed are <a href="manganese%20nodule">manganese nodule</a>s formed of layers of <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="manganese">manganese</a> and other hydroxides around a core. In the Pacific these may cover up to 30 percent of the deep ocean floor. The minerals precipitate from seawater and grow very slowly. Their commercial extraction for <a href="nickel">nickel</a> was investigated in the 1970s but abandoned in favour of more convenient sources. In suitable locations, <a href="diamond">diamond</a>s are gathered from the seafloor using suction hoses to bring gravel ashore. In deeper waters, mobile seafloor crawlers are used and the deposits are pumped to a vessel above. In Namibia, more diamonds are now collected from marine sources than by conventional methods on land.
The sea holds enormous quantities of valuable dissolved minerals. The most important, <a href="Sea%20salt">Salt</a> for table and industrial use has been harvested by solar evaporation from shallow ponds since prehistoric times. <a href="Bromine">Bromine</a>, accumulated after being leached from the land, is economically recovered from the Dead Sea, where it occurs at 55,000 parts per million (ppm).

<a href="Desalination">Desalination</a> is the technique of removing salts from seawater to leave <a href="Drinking%20water">fresh water</a> suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, <a href="vacuum%20distillation">vacuum distillation</a> and <a href="reverse%20osmosis">reverse osmosis</a>, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.

Many substances enter the sea as a result of human activities. Combustion products are transported in the air and deposited into the sea by precipitation. Industrial outflows and <a href="sewage%20treatment%20plant">sewage</a> contribute <a href="Heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a>, <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s, <a href="Polychlorinated%20biphenyl">PCBs</a>, <a href="disinfectant">disinfectant</a>s, household cleaning products and other <a href="synthetic%20chemical">synthetic chemical</a>s. These become concentrated in the surface film and in marine sediment, especially estuarine mud. The result of all this contamination is largely unknown because of the large number of substances involved and the lack of information on their biological effects. The heavy metals of greatest concern are copper, lead, mercury, <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a> and zinc which may be <a href="Bio-accumulation">bio-accumulated</a> by marine invertebrates. They are cumulative toxins and are passed up the food chain.

Much floating plastic rubbish does not <a href="Biodegradation">biodegrade</a>, instead disintegrating over time and eventually breaking down to the molecular level. Rigid plastics may float for years. In the centre of the Pacific gyre there is a permanent <a href="Great%20Pacific%20garbage%20patch">floating accumulation</a> of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar <a href="North%20Atlantic%20garbage%20patch">garbage patch</a> in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the <a href="albatross">albatross</a> and <a href="petrel">petrel</a> may mistake debris for food, and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with plastic bags and fishing line in their stomachs. <a href="Microplastics">Microplastics</a> may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.

Most oil pollution in the sea comes from cities and industry. Oil is dangerous for marine animals. It can clog the feathers of sea birds, reducing their insulating effect and the birds' buoyancy, and be ingested when they preen themselves in an attempt to remove the contaminant. <a href="Marine%20mammals">Marine mammals</a> are less seriously affected but may be chilled through the removal of their insulation, blinded, dehydrated or poisoned. <a href="Benthos">Benthic</a> invertebrates are swamped when the oil sinks, fish are poisoned and the food chain is disrupted. In the short term, oil spills result in wildlife populations being decreased and unbalanced, leisure activities being affected and the livelihoods of people dependant on the sea being devastated. The marine environment has self-cleansing properties and naturally occurring bacteria will act over time to remove oil from the sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, where oil-eating bacteria are already present, they take only a few days to consume spilt oil.

Run-off of <a href="fertiliser">fertiliser</a>s from agricultural land is a major source of pollution in some areas and the discharge of raw <a href="sewage">sewage</a> has a similar effect. The extra nutrients provided by these sources can cause <a href="eutrophication">excessive plant growth</a>. Nitrogen is often the limiting factor in marine systems, and with added nitrogen, algal blooms and <a href="red%20tide">red tide</a>s can lower the oxygen level of the water and kill marine animals. Such events have created dead zones in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Some <a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a>s are caused by <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> that make <a href="shellfish">shellfish</a> that <a href="Filter%20feeder">filter feed</a> on them toxic, harming animals like <a href="sea%20otter">sea otter</a>s. Nuclear facilities too can pollute. The Irish Sea was contaminated by radioactive <a href="caesium-137">caesium-137</a> from the former <a href="Sellafield">Sellafield</a> nuclear fuel processing plant and nuclear accidents may also cause radioactive material to seep into the sea, as did the disaster at the <a href="Fukushima%20Daiichi%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant">Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant</a> in 2011.

The dumping of waste (including oil, noxious liquids, sewage and garbage) at sea is governed by international law. The <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Marine%20Pollution%20by%20Dumping%20of%20Wastes%20and%20Other%20Matter">London Convention</a> (1972) is a <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> agreement to control ocean dumping which had been ratified by 89 countries by 8 June 2012. <a href="MARPOL%2073/78">MARPOL 73/78</a> is a convention to minimize pollution of the seas by ships. By May 2013, 152 maritime nations had ratified MARPOL.

Several <a href="nomad">nomad</a>ic indigenous groups in <a href="Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia">Maritime Southeast Asia</a> live in boats and derive nearly all they need from the sea. The <a href="Moken%20people">Moken people</a> live on the coasts of <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> and <a href="Burma">Burma</a> and islands in the <a href="Andaman%20Sea">Andaman Sea</a>. The <a href="Bajau%20people">Bajau people</a> are originally from the <a href="Sulu%20Archipelago">Sulu Archipelago</a>, <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a> and northern <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. Some Sea Gypsies are accomplished <a href="Free-diving">free-divers</a>, able to descend to depths of , though many are adopting a more settled, land-based way of life.

The indigenous peoples of the Arctic such as the <a href="Chukchi%20people">Chukchi</a>, <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a>, <a href="Inuvialuit">Inuvialuit</a> and <a href="Yupik%20peoples">Yup'iit</a> hunt marine mammals including seals and whales, and the <a href="Torres%20Strait%20Islanders">Torres Strait Islanders</a> of Australia include ownership of the Great Barrier Reef among their possessions. They live a traditional life on the islands involving hunting, fishing, gardening and trading with neighbouring peoples in Papua and mainland <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal Australians</a>.

The sea appears in human culture in contradictory ways, as both powerful but serene and as beautiful but dangerous. It has its place in literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, classical music, mythology and dream interpretation. The <a href="Ancient%20history">Ancients</a> personified it, believing it to be under the control of a <a href="List%20of%20water%20deities">being</a> who needed to be appeased, and symbolically, it has been perceived as a hostile environment populated by fantastic creatures; the <a href="Leviathan">Leviathan</a> of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, <a href="Scylla">Scylla</a> in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, <a href="Isonade">Isonade</a> in <a href="Japanese%20mythology">Japanese mythology</a>, and the <a href="kraken">kraken</a> of late <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>. Civilizations have advanced through maritime trade and the exchange of ideas.
The sea and ships have been <a href="Marine%20art">depicted in art</a> ranging from simple drawings on the walls of huts in <a href="Lamu%20Archipelago">Lamu</a> to seascapes by <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">Joseph Turner</a>. In <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age%20painting">Dutch Golden Age painting</a>, artists such as <a href="Jan%20Porcellis">Jan Porcellis</a>, <a href="Hendrick%20Dubbels">Hendrick Dubbels</a>, <a href="Willem%20van%20de%20Velde%20the%20Elder">Willem van de Velde the Elder</a> and <a href="Willem%20van%20de%20Velde%20the%20Younger">his son</a>, and <a href="Ludolf%20Bakhuizen">Ludolf Bakhuizen</a> celebrated the sea and the <a href="Dutch%20navy">Dutch navy</a> at the peak of its military prowess. The Japanese artist <a href="Katsushika%20Hokusai">Katsushika Hokusai</a> created colour <a href="Printmaking">prints</a> of the moods of the sea, including "<a href="The%20Great%20Wave%20off%20Kanagawa">The Great Wave off Kanagawa</a>".

Music too has been inspired by the ocean, sometimes by composers who lived or worked near the shore and saw its many different aspects. <a href="Sea%20shanty">Sea shanties</a>, songs that were chanted by mariners to help them perform arduous tasks, have been woven into compositions and impressions in music have been created of calm waters, crashing waves and storms at sea. Classical sea-related music includes <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>'s "<a href="The%20Flying%20Dutchman%20%28opera%29">The Flying Dutchman</a>", <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>'s "<a href="La%20mer%20%28Debussy%29">La mer</a>" (1903–05), <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a>'s "Songs of the Sea" (1904) and "Songs of the Fleet" (1910), <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Edward Elgar</a>'s "<a href="Sea%20Pictures">Sea Pictures</a>" (1899) and <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>' "<a href="A%20Sea%20Symphony">A Sea Symphony</a>" (1903–1909).

As a symbol, the sea has for centuries played a role in <a href="literature">literature</a>, <a href="poetry">poetry</a> and <a href="dream">dream</a>s. Sometimes it is there just as a gentle background but often it introduces such themes as storm, shipwreck, battle, hardship, disaster, the dashing of hopes and death. In his <a href="epic%20poetry">epic poem</a> the "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", written in the 8th century BC, <a href="Homer">Homer</a> describes the ten-year voyage of the Greek hero <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> who struggles to return home across the sea's many hazards after the war described in the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>". The sea is a recurring theme in the <a href="Haiku">Haiku</a> poems of the Japanese <a href="Edo%20period">Edo period</a> poet <a href="Matsuo%20Bash%C5%8D">Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉)</a> (1644–1694). In modern literature, sea-inspired novels have been written by <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a> — drawn from <a href="Joseph%20Conrad%27s%20career%20at%20sea">his experience at sea</a>, <a href="Herman%20Wouk">Herman Wouk</a>, and <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>. In the works of psychiatrist <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a>, the sea symbolizes the personal and the <a href="collective%20unconscious">collective unconscious</a> in <a href="dream%20interpretation">dream interpretation</a>, the depths of the sea symbolizing the depths of the <a href="unconscious%20mind">unconscious mind</a>.

But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist: the threat is rather to life itself".

68th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment

The 68th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment served in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. Also known as the Cameron Rifles or the Second German Rifle Regiment, the men were mostly German immigrants. Organized in July 1861, three months after the outbreak of war, the 68th saw service in the <a href="Eastern%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Eastern</a> and <a href="Western%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Western</a> theaters.

As a part of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>, it was initially assigned to the defenses of Washington, D.C. Later, the 68th was transferred to the Shenandoah Valley and fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cross%20Keys">Battle of Cross Keys</a>. The men of the 68th were then reassigned to central Virginia and found themselves in the thick of the fighting at <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Bull Run</a>. After returning to the nation's capital, the regiment fought in <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Chancellorsville</a> and was routed by Confederate forces. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Gettysburg</a>, they saw battle on two of the three days and took heavy losses.

The regiment was then transferred to the west and participated in the <a href="Chattanooga%20Campaign">Chattanooga Campaign</a>. The 68th fought in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Wauhatchie">Wauhatchie</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Missionary%20Ridge">Missionary Ridge</a>, assisting in the Union victories there. The regiment marched to relieve the <a href="Knoxville%20Campaign">siege of Knoxville</a>, and then spent the last year of the war on occupation duty in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> and <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, before being disbanded in November 1865.

On July 22, 1861, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">United States War Department</a> authorized <a href="Robert%20J.%20Betge">Robert J. Betge</a> to raise a volunteer infantry regiment in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. Recruited to serve for three years, the men came mostly from <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> (New York City), and also from <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, and <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. The mostly <a href="German%20American">German immigrants</a> were also called the "Second German Rifles" (the First German Rifles, raised several months earlier, were the <a href="8th%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">8th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>), but Betge called the regiment the "Cameron Rifles", after Secretary of War <a href="Simon%20Cameron">Simon Cameron</a>. The officers were also German, and many had served in the armies of <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austria</a>, <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, and <a href="German%20Confederation">other German states</a>. In all, 1,020 men filled the ranks when the regiment had finished recruiting.

Accepted into service on August 19, the 68th left New York the next day, traveling by train from <a href="Perth%20Amboy%2C%20New%20Jersey">Perth Amboy, New Jersey</a>, to Washington, D.C., to join the <a href="brigade">brigade</a> of <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Louis%20Blenker">Louis Blenker</a> in the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>. Blenker was a German immigrant himself, a refugee of the <a href="German%20revolutions%20of%201848%E2%80%9349">Revolutions of 1848</a>, and many of the units under his command were heavily German-American. Encamped at Roach's Mills, Virginia, the 68th participated in the defense of Washington, losing three men in their first combat, a minor skirmish with a <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate</a> patrol.

In November, the Army was reorganized; the 68th was shifted to <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Adolph%20von%20Steinwehr">Adolph von Steinwehr</a>'s brigade and Blenker moved up to command the <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a>. They encamped at Hunter's Chapel, Virginia, for the remainder of the winter. There, Betge was brought before a <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>, accused of "conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman": confiscating two horses and other property from "loyal" Virginia citizens, and taking a bribe to hire the 68th's regimental <a href="sutler">sutler</a>. He was not convicted, and was permitted to return to the regiment.
In March 1862, the Army was again reorganized and Blenker's brigade was merged into the <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">II Corps</a>, led by <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="Edwin%20Vose%20Sumner">Edwin Vose Sumner</a>. That month the 68th moved to <a href="Warrenton%2C%20Virginia">Warrenton, Virginia</a>, where it came into contact with Confederate cavalry; three of the officers were captured. The following month, Blenker's brigade was moved into Maj. Gen. <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a>'s Mountain Department, necessitating a march to <a href="Winchester%2C%20Virginia">Winchester</a>, Virginia, where the 68th and the rest of Frémont's army guarded the western part of the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a> against incursions by Confederate forces under <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28CSA%29">Lt. Gen.</a> <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Stonewall Jackson</a>. Their long march had left the 68th bereft of supplies and low on rations. Colonel Betge protested against the mistreatment of his regiment, and was placed under arrest, surrendering command to <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lt. Col.</a>, John H. Kleefish.

The initial action in <a href="Jackson%27s%20Valley%20Campaign">Jackson's Valley Campaign</a> took place to their east, but in June Frémont's force of 15,000 joined the 10,000-man division of Brig. Gen. <a href="James%20Shields%20%28politician%2C%20born%201810%29">James Shields</a> to converge on Jackson south of <a href="Massanutten%20Mountain">Massanutten Mountain</a>. Jackson was determined to attack the two Union columns separately and arranged half of his troops to block Shields on the right side of the mountain, while the other half, commanded by Maj. Gen. <a href="Richard%20S.%20Ewell">Richard S. Ewell</a>, blocked the left side. Jackson's wish was realized when, on June 8, Frémont's army attacked. Frémont, believing he was striking Jackson's rear, instead attacked Ewell head-on, and Jackson soon brought his whole force to bear on the Union troops in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cross%20Keys">Battle of Cross Keys</a>. The men of the 68th came under concentrated fire for the first time but were not heavily involved in the battle, although two men were killed. The battle was a defeat for the Union, and Frémont's force did not attack again, being blocked instead by a small holding force from Ewell's wing. The rest of Jackson's force then turned to attack Shields's army the next day at <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Republic">Port Republic</a>, but Frémont's infantry did not figure in the battle, another Confederate victory, though his artillery shelled the enemy from long range.

After the battle, the 68th marched to <a href="Cedar%20Creek%20%28North%20Fork%20Shenandoah%20River%29">Cedar Creek</a> and the army was placed under the overall command of Maj. Gen. <a href="John%20Pope%20%28military%20officer%29">John Pope</a>; Frémont's force was designated the First <a href="Corps">Corps</a> of the <a href="Army%20of%20Virginia">Army of Virginia</a>. Frémont, who outranked Pope, resigned in protest, and President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln</a> accepted the resignation. Lincoln replaced him with Maj. Gen. <a href="Franz%20Sigel">Franz Sigel</a>, who had been commanding troops in the Western theater. Sigel was, like many in the First Corps, a German immigrant, and the 68th and the other German regiments in the First Corps were happy for the change in commanders. Sigel ordered the 68th to <a href="Luray%2C%20Virginia">Luray</a> for <a href="Picket%20%28military%29">picket duty</a>. When they arrived, Betge resigned his commission and Kleefish continued to command the regiment until a new colonel could be assigned.

The regiment remained in the Shenandoah Valley until August 1862 when they joined Pope's army and moved south to engage <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>. They arrived the day after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cedar%20Mountain">Battle of Cedar Mountain</a>, and joined Pope's army in its retreat from that Confederate victory. After a series of <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Rappahannock%20Station">minor actions along the Rappahannock</a>, Pope's forces met Jackson's half of Lee's army near <a href="Manassas%20Station%20Operations%20%28Stonewall%20Jackson%29">Manassas Station</a>. Lee had divided his army into wings led by Jackson and Lt. Gen. <a href="James%20Longstreet">James Longstreet</a> and sent Jackson's force to raid Pope's rear to cut his supply line. Pope believed he had a chance to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia one half at a time, and made the decision to attack. Jackson's men struck the first blow, however, and drove off a portion of the Union force. The next day, having taken up a strong defensive position along an unfinished railroad, Jackson awaited Pope's advance. Pope obliged him, sending the Army forward against Jackson's lines. The 68th and the rest of Sigel's corps occupied the middle of the advancing line. They were unable to break Jackson's lines, and withdrew. The Cameron Rifles had seen some action at Cross Keys, but this was their first experience of fierce fighting and they acquitted themselves well, despite the failure of the attack.

By the afternoon, Longstreet joined Jackson with the other half of Lee's army and attacked the Union left. Longstreet believed it was too late for an attack, and did not attack that day, other than in a minor clash where his lines met some federal units at dusk. The next day, August 30, Pope attacked Jackson again at 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon. Again, the attacking forces could not overcome their enemies' positions, and this time Longstreet counterattacked and forced them back toward their original positions. Sigel's forces, which did not take part in the initial Union assault, held firm against the Confederate counterattack, but after heavy casualties the army retreated. Among the casualties were 22 killed from the 68th (including Kleefish) and 59 wounded, making <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Bull Run</a> one of the unit's bloodiest engagements.

The Army of Virginia retreated nearly all the way back to Washington. Pope was relieved and Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a> placed in charge of the army once more. After burying Kleefish in Washington, the 68th redeployed to <a href="Fairfax%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax, Virginia</a>. With Kleefish dead and Betge having resigned, command of the regiment fell temporarily to <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">Major</a> <a href="Carl%20von%20Wedell">Carl von Wedell</a>. The officers then petitioned the Governor <a href="Horatio%20Seymour">Horatio Seymour</a> to commission <a href="Gotthilf%20von%20Bourry%20d%27Ivernois">Gotthilf von Bourry d'Ivernois</a> as their new colonel, which he did. Von Bourry, a veteran of the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian</a> army, had served on Blenker's staff as a <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">captain</a> and had impressed the officers of the 68th with his tales of heroism in the <a href="Second%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence">Second Italian War of Independence</a>.

The 68th spent September and October 1862 defending Washington where they were attached to <a href="Alexander%20Schimmelfennig">Alexander Schimmelfennig</a>'s 1st Brigade of the <a href="XI%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">XI Corps</a> in the Army of the Potomac (the re-numbered I Corps formerly of the Army of Virginia) still commanded by Sigel. In November, they advanced to <a href="Centreville%2C%20Virginia">Centreville</a> with the rest of the Army, now under the command of Maj. Gen. <a href="Ambrose%20Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a>. Burnside, who had taken over the Army when McClellan was relieved of command earlier that month, was determined to bring battle to the enemy, and he ordered the Army to advance once more to the Rappahannock. The 68th, however, remained in <a href="military%20reserve">reserve</a> with the rest of the XI Corps, and so was spared any part in the defeat that befell the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a>. The Army retreated once again, and the 68th joined them in winter quarters at <a href="Stafford%2C%20Virginia">Stafford, Virginia</a>.

Morale was low in the Army after Fredericksburg and the retreat that followed, and Burnside was replaced in command by Maj. Gen. <a href="Joseph%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>. Several corps commanders were also replaced, including Sigel, whose XI Corps passed to Maj. Gen. <a href="Oliver%20O.%20Howard">Oliver O. Howard</a> on April 2, 1863, when he resigned in protest because he believed he deserved a larger corps. In a corps of mostly German regiments, Howard was immediately unpopular and his distribution of religious tracts to the troops did not improve the relationship. The regiment was smaller, too, than it had been: just 259 present for duty. Their new commander in the XI Corps's 3rd Brigade was another German, Brig. Gen. <a href="Carl%20Schurz">Carl Schurz</a>.

Hooker brought the Army to the Rappahannock for a third time, but rather than crossing directly into the defenses of the Confederates, he divided his much larger force to attack Lee's army from two sides simultaneously. This time, the 68th and the other regiments of the XI Corps were part of the action, crossing the river with Hooker's main force on May 1, 1863, to attack Lee's left. Despite Hooker's careful planning, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a> was another Union defeat. After crossing the Rappahannock, Hooker had ordered the wing including the XI Corps to halt and await the Confederate attack. Faced with attacks on two sides, Lee daringly divided his smaller force to engage both: the pause allowed Lee to send Jackson with the bulk of the army to meet the Union advance and outflank their right wing the next day, May 2. Although he was warned of the impending attack, Howard did not order the units under his command to <a href="trench%20warfare">entrench</a>, and when Jackson's men arrived the XI Corps was caught unprepared. At about 5:15 p.m., Jackson's force of 21,500 men caught the XI Corps in the flank and by surprise as the men were preparing their dinner. Schurz ordered his brigade to shift to meet the assault, and the 68th jumped to action, but they were still overwhelmed by the force of numbers and began a disorganized retreat an hour into the attack. After falling back, the 68th and the other retreating units rallied to avoid a complete rout and held off the Confederates until nightfall. The XI Corps suffered nearly 2,500 casualties, including 5 dead, 16 wounded, and 32 missing from the 68th. The next day, the XI Corps held the left of the Union line and was again attacked, but unlike the previous day, they were not at the focus of the Confederate attack. The entire army retreated across the Rappahannock the next day, defeated once more.

In the wake of Chancellorsville, newspapers heaped scorn on the German regiments, blaming the 68th and the others for the defeat. The XI Corps suffered from low morale, and several officers resigned their commissions, including Lt. Col. Carl Vogel and five others from the 68th. The Army of the Potomac pulled back from the Rappahannock, and was soon on the move as the Army of Northern Virginia slipped past and marched north toward Pennsylvania. Led by still another new commander, Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20Meade">George Meade</a>, the Union army followed the Confederates north. The 68th, now with 267 present for duty, had been shifted to the XI Corps's 1st Brigade under Brig. Gen. <a href="Leopold%20von%20Gilsa">Leopold von Gilsa</a> when the Army of the Potomac prepared to meet the rebels at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a>. The XI Corps was among the first to arrive on the scene on July 1, 1863. Schurz's brigade arrived first, and he ordered them to take up defensive positions north of the town. The other two divisions arrived next, and Howard arrayed them to resist the rebel onslaught he knew was coming soon. The landscape was mostly devoid of features that would aid in defense, but Gilsa's men were able to entrench on one low rise, Blocher's Knoll. The 68th was sent forward to skirmish, along with the <a href="54th%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">54th New York</a> and part of the <a href="153rd%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">153rd New York</a>, and were the first to be attacked and ousted from their positions when Lt. Gen. <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a>'s Confederate division came on in numbers and outflanked them. The army retreated south of the town, but Howard, after arguing with Maj. Gen. <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a> over who was in command in Meade's absence, rallied the troops there and ordered them to entrench.

The 68th began the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg%2C%20Second%20Day">second day</a> in a more defensible position on <a href="Cemetery%20Hill">Cemetery Hill</a>. This placed them at the center of the Union line, and most of the day's early action was on the flanks. In the evening, however, Early's forces attacked again; the charging Confederates quickly reached the top of the hill and some hand-to-hand combat broke out, but losses were light because the growing darkness made it difficult for soldiers on both sides to shoot accurately. Reinforcements from the <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">II Corps</a> arrived and helped the XI Corps hold the position. On the third day, the 68th remained in that position, but the major attack of the day, <a href="Pickett%27s%20Charge">Pickett's Charge</a>, was to their left. The 68th performed better than they had at Chancellorsville, participating in their first Union victory. They paid the price with much higher casualties, 8 killed and 63 wounded; 67 were made prisoners of war, many on the first day during the retreat to Cemetery Hill. In the thick of the action for two out of three days, the 68th lost more men at Gettysburg than in any other battle.

Lee's army retreated into Virginia and, after some delay, the Army of the Potomac followed. After a skirmish in <a href="Hagerstown%2C%20Maryland">Hagerstown, Maryland</a>, on July 12, the 68th crossed the Potomac into Virginia on July 16 and took up guard duty along the <a href="Orange%20and%20Alexandria%20Railroad">Orange and Alexandria Railroad</a> near <a href="Warrenton%2C%20Virginia">Warrenton</a>. The regiment remained there until September, when it and the rest of the XI Corps were detached from the Army of the Potomac and sent to <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>. The XI and <a href="XII%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">XII Corps</a>, under Hooker's command, made up an independent force added to the Armies of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, and the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Ohio">Ohio</a>, which were all operating in that theater. Maj. Gen. <a href="William%20Rosecrans">William Rosecrans</a>, having just lost the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a>, was besieged in <a href="Chattanooga%2C%20Tennessee">Chattanooga</a>, and the other armies were gathering to lift the siege and attack the Confederate army there, led by Lt. Gen. <a href="Braxton%20Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a>. Traveling for seven days by rail, the 68th arrived in Tennessee on September 30.

The regiment spent the first month guarding railroads again, this time west of Chattanooga. Rosecrans soon found himself relieved of duty, and Maj. Gen. <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> was placed in overall command of the three armies plus Hooker's two corps. The 68th, too, saw a change in its leadership when Col. von Bourry was cashiered for drunkenness and command passed to Lt. Col. Albert von Steinhausen. By this time, losses from Gettysburg and illness had reduced the regiment to 127 men present for duty, just over a tenth of their numbers from the start of the war.

Grant's armies converged on Chattanooga and planned to attack Bragg's army. Getting into place required the XI and XII Corps to cross the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a> at <a href="Bridgeport%2C%20Alabama">Bridgeport, Alabama</a>, and march rapidly for Lookout Valley, opening the supply line to Chattanooga. They did so, to the surprise of the Confederate forces there, which had not expected an attack from that quarter. On October 28, Hooker's two corps were attacked by a part of Bragg's army, which had by now been joined by Longstreet and some units from the Army of Northern Virginia. Bragg ordered Longstreet to drive the federals back and he attacked. In the ensuing <a href="Battle%20of%20Wauhatchie">Battle of Wauhatchie</a>, the XII Corps took the brunt of the initial assault. Hooker bypassed Howard and ordered Schurz to bring up the XI Corps to join the fight. The engagement was confused on both sides, but the Union forces were victorious, driving off the rebels and inflicting twice the casualties they received. With the supply lines now reopened to Chattanooga, Grant planned to dislodge Bragg's army. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lookout%20Mountain">Battle of Lookout Mountain</a>, the 68th was held in reserve on the first day, November 24. The battle continued the next day and a part of Howard's XI Corps, including the 68th, was shifted to the far left of the Union lines to reinforce Sherman's <a href="Battle%20of%20Missionary%20Ridge">attack on Missionary Ridge</a>. There, the 68th skirmished with the enemy, but was unable to advance. The Confederates were forced to retreat, however, as Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20Henry%20Thomas">George Thomas</a>'s troops' assault on their center sent Bragg's army into retreat from the ridge.

Four days later, on November 28, the 68th, still attached to Sherman's army, marched north to relieve Burnside's army, which was besieged in <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville, Tennessee</a>. Before they arrived, however, Burnside managed to defeat the enemy, and the regiment returned south. It spent the winter guarding railroads near their winter quarters in Bridgeport. In April, the enlistments of many three-year men were due to expire, including the men of the 68th. The men were sent to <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, and then by rail back to New York City for four weeks' leave of absence. With the war not yet over, the government encouraged re-enlisting, and many of the 68th did so. The three-year men of the 8th and <a href="29th%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">29th</a> Infantry, two other German-American units reduced by casualties and expiring enlistment terms, were consolidated into the 68th. <a href="Conscription%23American%20Civil%20War">Drafted men</a> and substitutes brought the ranks up to 400 present for duty.

Among those continuing in the army was the colonel of the 8th New York, Prince <a href="Felix%20Salm-Salm">Felix Salm-Salm</a>. As the 68th had been without a colonel since von Bourry had been cashiered, Governor Seymour appointed Salm-Salm to the post on June 8, 1864. The youngest son of a minor German prince, Salm-Salm had served in the <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n and Austrian armies before coming to America and joining the Union Army in 1861. His appointment to lead the 68th caused consternation among the officers, who had hoped for the promotion of one of their own. They protested to the governor unsuccessfully, but accepted that Salm-Salm was to be their leader. After the commissions and re-enlistments were sorted out, the 68th returned to Tennessee. They were again serving under Hooker in the <a href="XX%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">XX Corps</a>, which was consolidated from the XI and XII Corps and had now been attached permanently to Thomas's <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Cumberland">Army of the Cumberland</a>. The 68th was assigned to Maj. Gen. <a href="James%20B.%20Steedman">James B. Steedman</a>'s 4th Brigade of the new corps and spent the next few months patrolling the <a href="Nashville%2C%20Chattanooga%20and%20St.%20Louis%20Railway">Nashville and Chattanooga Railway</a> in Tennessee. By that time, Confederate resistance in the area was weakened, and the rails and bridges were not damaged. Salm-Salm's wife, <a href="Agnes%20Salm-Salm">Agnes</a>, joined him during the winter of 1864–1865, and the officers spent much of their time entertaining.

The 68th was not involved in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nashville">Battle of Nashville</a> that December, in which Lt. Gen. <a href="John%20Bell%20Hood">John Bell Hood</a>'s Confederate army was nearly destroyed, but Salm-Salm did get permission to join the battle himself while the 68th stayed at their patrol stations. After Thomas's victory at Nashville, the 68th was ordered to prepare to pursue what remained of Hood's army. They redeployed to <a href="Decatur%2C%20Alabama">Decatur, Alabama</a>, where Salm-Salm rejoined the regiment. They skirmished with Hood's rear guard, but the rainy weather aided the Confederates' escape. Salm-Salm led the regiment in the minor engagements following in January and February 1865 at Elrod's Tan Yard, Hog Jaw Valley, and Johnson's Crook. As Maj. Gen. <a href="William%20T.%20Sherman">William T. Sherman</a>'s Army of the Tennessee <a href="Sherman%27s%20March%20to%20the%20Sea">advanced farther into Georgia</a>, the 68th did as well, making Atlanta their headquarters in March 1865. They continued to serve in northern <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> through the spring and summer of 1865, and were stationed there when news came that the major Confederate armies had surrendered to Grant and Sherman. While there, they were ordered to facilitate the transition from a <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slave-based economy</a> to a <a href="Sharecropping%23United%20States%20of%20America">sharecropper system</a> by encouraging plantation owners and their former slaves to sign farming contracts.

The 68th moved to <a href="Fort%20Pulaski%20National%20Monument">Fort Pulaski</a>, outside <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a>, in October 1865. The men remained there until November 30, 1865, when, with the war finally ended, the 68th New York was mustered out of federal service. They boarded a steamship for New York and received their final pay at <a href="Hart%27s%20Island">Hart's Island</a> on December 14, where they disbanded. The regiment had served for more than four years, and had suffered casualties of 47 killed, 133 wounded, and 116 captured.

Alzheimer's disease

Alzheimer's disease (AD), also referred to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic <a href="neurodegeneration">neurodegenerative</a> disease that usually starts slowly and gradually worsens over time. It is the cause of 60–70% of cases of <a href="dementia">dementia</a>. The most common early symptom is <a href="short-term%20memory">difficulty in remembering recent events</a>. As the disease advances, symptoms can include <a href="primary%20progressive%20aphasia">problems with language</a>, <a href="Orientation%20%28mental%29">disorientation</a> (including easily getting lost), <a href="mood%20swing">mood swing</a>s, loss of <a href="motivation">motivation</a>, not managing <a href="Activities%20of%20daily%20living">self care</a>, and <a href="challenging%20behaviour">behavioural issues</a>. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.
The cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. About 70% of the risk is believed to be <a href="heredity">inherited from a person's parents</a> with many <a href="gene">gene</a>s usually involved. Other risk factors include a history of <a href="head%20injury">head injuries</a>, <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>, and <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a>. The disease process is associated with <a href="Senile%20plaques">plaques</a> and <a href="neurofibrillary%20tangle">neurofibrillary tangle</a>s in the <a href="human%20brain">brain</a>. A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and <a href="cognitive%20test">cognitive test</a>ing with <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a> and <a href="blood%20test">blood test</a>s to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal ageing. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis. <a href="Mental%20exercise">Mental</a> and <a href="physical%20exercise">physical exercise</a>, and avoiding <a href="obesity">obesity</a> may decrease the risk of AD; however, evidence to support these recommendations is weak. There are no medications or supplements that have been shown to decrease risk.
No treatments stop or reverse its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms. Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing a burden on the <a href="Caring%20for%20people%20with%20dementia">caregiver</a>. The pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programs may be beneficial with respect to <a href="activities%20of%20daily%20living">activities of daily living</a> and can potentially improve outcomes. Behavioural problems or <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a> due to dementia are often treated with <a href="antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a>s, but this is not usually recommended, as there is little benefit with an increased risk of early death.
In 2015, there were approximately 29.8 million people worldwide with AD. It most often begins in people over 65 years of age, although 4–5% of cases are <a href="Early-onset%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease">early-onset Alzheimer's</a>. It affects about 6% of people 65 years and older. In 2015, dementia resulted in about 1.9 million deaths. It was first described by, and later named after, German psychiatrist and pathologist <a href="Alois%20Alzheimer">Alois Alzheimer</a> in 1906. In <a href="developed%20country">developed countries</a>, AD is one of the most financially costly diseases.

The disease course is divided into four stages, with a progressive pattern of <a href="cognitive">cognitive</a> and <a href="functional%20symptom">functional</a> <a href="Disability">impairment</a>.

The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to <a href="ageing">ageing</a> or <a href="stress%20%28biology%29">stress</a>. Detailed <a href="neuropsychological%20test">neuropsychological test</a>ing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for <a href="medical%20diagnosis">diagnosis</a> of AD. These early symptoms can affect the most complex <a href="activities%20of%20daily%20living">activities of daily living</a>. The most noticeable deficit is <a href="short%20term%20memory">short term memory</a> loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.

Subtle problems with the <a href="executive%20functions">executive functions</a> of <a href="attention">attentiveness</a>, <a href="planning">planning</a>, flexibility, and <a href="abstraction">abstract thinking</a>, or impairments in <a href="semantic%20memory">semantic memory</a> (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of the early stages of AD. <a href="Apathy">Apathy</a> can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent <a href="neuropsychiatry">neuropsychiatric</a> symptom throughout the course of the disease. Depressive symptoms, irritability and reduced awareness of subtle memory difficulties are also common.
The preclinical stage of the disease has also been termed <a href="mild%20cognitive%20impairment">mild cognitive impairment</a> (MCI). This is often found to be a transitional stage between normal ageing and <a href="dementia">dementia</a>. MCI can present with a variety of symptoms, and when memory loss is the predominant symptom, it is termed "amnestic MCI" and is frequently seen as a <a href="prodromal">prodromal</a> stage of Alzheimer's disease.

In people with AD, the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, <a href="perception">perception</a> (<a href="agnosia">agnosia</a>), or execution of movements (<a href="apraxia">apraxia</a>) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. <a href="long-term%20memory">Older memories</a> of the person's life (<a href="episodic%20memory">episodic memory</a>), facts learned (<a href="semantic%20memory">semantic memory</a>), and <a href="implicit%20memory">implicit memory</a> (the memory of the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.

<a href="primary%20progressive%20aphasia">Language problems</a> are mainly characterised by a shrinking <a href="vocabulary">vocabulary</a> and decreased word <a href="fluency">fluency</a>, leading to a general impoverishment of oral and <a href="written%20language">written language</a>. In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually capable of communicating basic ideas adequately. While performing <a href="fine%20motor%20skill">fine motor tasks</a> such as writing, drawing or dressing, certain movement coordination and planning difficulties (apraxia) may be present, but they are commonly unnoticed. As the disease progresses, people with AD can often continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities.

Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence, with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living. Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to <a href="Anomic%20aphasia">recall vocabulary</a>, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (<a href="paraphasia">paraphasia</a>s). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. <a href="Long-term%20memory">Long-term memory</a>, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.

Behavioural and <a href="neuropsychiatric">neuropsychiatric</a> changes become more prevalent. Common manifestations are <a href="Wandering%20%28dementia%29">wandering</a>, <a href="irritability">irritability</a> and <a href="labile%20affect">labile affect</a>, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated <a href="aggression">aggression</a>, or resistance to caregiving. <a href="Sundowning">Sundowning</a> can also appear. Approximately 30% of people with AD develop <a href="Delusional%20misidentification%20syndrome">illusionary misidentifications</a> and other <a href="delusion">delusion</a>al symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (<a href="anosognosia">anosognosia</a>). <a href="Urinary%20incontinence">Urinary incontinence</a> can develop. These symptoms create <a href="stress%20%28biology%29">stress</a> for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from <a href="home%20care">home care</a> to other <a href="Nursing%20home">long-term care facilities</a>.

During the final stages, the patient is completely dependent upon caregivers. Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech. Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme <a href="apathy">apathy</a> and <a href="Fatigue%20%28medical%29">exhaustion</a> are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately not be able to perform even the simplest tasks independently; <a href="musculature">muscle mass</a> and mobility deteriorates to the point where they are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of <a href="pressure%20ulcer">pressure ulcer</a>s or <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, not the disease itself.

The cause for most Alzheimer's cases is still mostly unknown except for 1% to 5% of cases where genetic differences have been identified. Several competing <a href="hypotheses">hypotheses</a> exist trying to explain the cause of the disease.

The genetic heritability of Alzheimer's disease (and memory components thereof), based on reviews of twin and family studies, ranges from 49% to 79%. Around 0.1% of the cases are familial forms of <a href="Autosome">autosomal</a> (not <a href="Sex%20linkage">sex-linked</a>) <a href="Dominance%20%28genetics%29">dominant</a> inheritance, which have an onset before age 65. This form of the disease is known as <a href="Familial%20Alzheimer%20disease">early onset familial Alzheimer's disease</a>. Most of autosomal dominant familial AD can be attributed to mutations in one of three genes: those encoding <a href="amyloid%20precursor%20protein">amyloid precursor protein</a> (APP) and <a href="presenilin">presenilin</a>s 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called <a href="A%CE%B2">Aβ</a>42, which is the main component of <a href="senile%20plaques">senile plaques</a>. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels.

Most cases of Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit autosomal-dominant inheritance and are termed sporadic AD, in which environmental and genetic differences may act as <a href="risk%20factor">risk factor</a>s. The best known genetic risk factor is the inheritance of the ε4 <a href="allele">allele</a> of the <a href="apolipoprotein%20E">apolipoprotein E</a> (APOE). Between 40 and 80% of people with AD possess at least one APOEε4 allele. The APOEε4 allele increases the risk of the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes. Like many human diseases, environmental effects and genetic modifiers result in incomplete <a href="penetrance">penetrance</a>. For example, certain Nigerian populations do not show the relationship between dose of APOEε4 and incidence or age-of-onset for Alzheimer's disease seen in other human populations. Early attempts to screen up to 400 candidate genes for association with late-onset sporadic AD (LOAD) resulted in a low yield. More recent <a href="genome-wide%20association%20studies">genome-wide association studies</a> (GWAS) have found 19 areas in genes that appear to affect the risk. These genes include: <a href="CASS4">CASS4</a>, <a href="CELF1">CELF1</a>, <a href="FERMT2">FERMT2</a>, <a href="HLA-DRB5">HLA-DRB5</a>, <a href="INPP5D">INPP5D</a>, <a href="MEF2C">MEF2C</a>, <a href="NME8">NME8</a>, <a href="PTK2B">PTK2B</a>, <a href="SORL1">SORL1</a>, <a href="ZCWPW1">ZCWPW1</a>, <a href="SlC24A4">SlC24A4</a>, <a href="CLU%20%28gene%29">CLU</a>, <a href="PICALM">PICALM</a>, <a href="Complement%20receptor%201">CR1</a>, <a href="BIN1">BIN1</a>, <a href="Membrane-spanning%204A">MS4A</a>, <a href="ABCA7">ABCA7</a>, <a href="EPHA1">EPHA1</a>, and <a href="CD2AP">CD2AP</a>.

<a href="Allele">Allele</a>s in the <a href="TREM2">TREM2</a> gene have been associated with a 3 to 5 times higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. A suggested mechanism of action is that in some variants in TREM2 white blood cells in the brain are no longer able to control the amount of beta amyloid present. Many <a href="Single-nucleotide%20polymorphism">SNPs</a> are associated with Alzheimer's with a 2018 study adding 30 SNPs by differentiating AD into 6 categories, including memory, language, visuospatial, and executive functioning.

The oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is the "<a href="cholinergic">cholinergic</a> hypothesis", which proposes that AD is caused by reduced synthesis of the <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> <a href="acetylcholine">acetylcholine</a>. The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective.

In 1991, the "<a href="amyloid%20beta">amyloid</a> hypothesis" postulated that extracellular amyloid beta (A) deposits are the fundamental cause of the disease. Support for this postulate comes from the location of the gene for the <a href="amyloid%20precursor%20protein">amyloid precursor protein</a> (APP) on <a href="chromosome%2021">chromosome 21</a>, together with the fact that people with <a href="trisomy%2021">trisomy 21</a> (<a href="Down%20Syndrome">Down Syndrome</a>) who have an extra <a href="gene%20dosage">gene copy</a> almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40 years of age. Also, a specific <a href="Protein%20isoform">isoform</a> of apolipoprotein, <a href="APOE4">APOE4</a>, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that <a href="Genetically%20modified%20organism">transgenic</a> mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.

An experimental vaccine was found to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, but it did not have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque A <a href="oligomer">oligomer</a>s (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of A. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for A oligomers may be the <a href="PRNP">prion protein</a>, the same protein that has been linked to <a href="Bovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy">mad cow disease</a> and the related human condition, <a href="Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob%20disease">Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease</a>, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these <a href="neurodegenerative">neurodegenerative</a> disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.

In 2009, this theory was updated, suggesting that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease. N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's <a href="N-terminus">N-terminus</a>, is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP by one of the same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as <a href="TNFRSF21">TNFRSF21</a>). DR6 is highly expressed in the human brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's, so it is possible that the N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the <a href="ageing%20brain">ageing brain</a> to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function.

In early 2017, a trial of <a href="verubecestat">verubecestat</a>, which inhibits the <a href="beta-secretase">beta-secretase</a> protein responsible for creating beta-amyloid protein was discontinued as an independent panel found "virtually no chance of finding a positive clinical effect".

The "tau hypothesis" proposes that <a href="tau%20protein">tau protein</a> abnormalities initiate the disease cascade. In this model, <a href="hyperphosphorylated">hyperphosphorylated</a> tau begins to pair with other threads of tau. Eventually, they form <a href="neurofibrillary%20tangle">neurofibrillary tangle</a>s inside nerve cell bodies. When this occurs, the <a href="microtubule">microtubule</a>s disintegrate, destroying the structure of the cell's <a href="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a> which collapses the neuron's transport system. This may result first in malfunctions in biochemical communication between neurons and later in the death of the cells.

A neurovascular hypothesis has been proposed which states that poor functioning of the <a href="blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood–brain barrier</a> may be involved.

The cellular <a href="homeostasis">homeostasis</a> of <a href="biometal%20%28biology%29">biometals</a> such as ionic copper, iron, and zinc is disrupted in AD, though it remains unclear whether this is produced by or causes the changes in proteins. These ions affect and are affected by tau, APP, and APOE, and their dysregulation may cause <a href="oxidative%20stress">oxidative stress</a> that may contribute to the pathology. The quality of some of these studies has been criticised, and the link remains controversial. The majority of researchers do not support a causal connection with aluminium.

Smoking is a significant AD risk factor. <a href="Inflammation%23Systemic%20effects">Systemic markers</a> of the <a href="innate%20immune%20system">innate immune system</a> are risk factors for late-onset AD.

There is tentative evidence that exposure to <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a> may be a contributing factor to the development of Alzheimer's disease.

<a href="Periodontal%20disease">Gum disease</a>: An infection with <a href="Spirochaete">Spirochetes</a> (a <a href="bacterium">bacterium</a>) in gum disease may cause <a href="dementia">dementia</a> and may be involved in the <a href="pathogenesis">pathogenesis</a> of Alzheimer's disease. A fungal infection may also be a factor.

One hypothesis posits that dysfunction of <a href="oligodendrocytes">oligodendrocytes</a> and their associated myelin during aging contributes to axon damage, which then causes amyloid production and tau hyper-phosphorylation as a side effect.

Retrogenesis is a medical <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a> about the development and progress of Alzheimer's disease proposed by Barry Reisberg in the 1980s. The hypothesis is that just as the fetus goes through a process of <a href="neurodevelopment">neurodevelopment</a> beginning with <a href="neurulation">neurulation</a> and ending with <a href="myelination">myelination</a>, the brains of people with AD go through a reverse <a href="neurodegeneration">neurodegeneration</a> process starting with <a href="demyelination">demyelination</a> and death of axons (white matter) and ending with the death of grey matter. Likewise the hypothesis is, that as infants go through states of <a href="cognitive%20development">cognitive development</a>, people with AD go through the reverse process of progressive <a href="cognitive%20impairment">cognitive impairment</a>. Reisberg developed the caregiving assessment tool known as "FAST" (Functional Assessment Staging Tool) which he says allows those caring for people with AD to identify the stages of disease progression and that provides advice about the kind of care needed at each stage.

The association with <a href="celiac%20disease">celiac disease</a> is unclear with a 2019 finding no increase in dementia overall in those those with CD while a 2018 review found an association with several types of dementia including AD.

Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s and <a href="synapse">synapse</a>s in the <a href="cerebral%20cortex">cerebral cortex</a> and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross <a href="atrophy">atrophy</a> of the affected regions, including degeneration in the <a href="temporal%20lobe">temporal lobe</a> and <a href="parietal%20lobe">parietal lobe</a>, and parts of the <a href="frontal%20cortex">frontal cortex</a> and <a href="cingulate%20gyrus">cingulate gyrus</a>. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the <a href="locus%20coeruleus">locus coeruleus</a>. Studies using <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">MRI</a> and <a href="positron%20emission%20tomography">PET</a> have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.

Both <a href="amyloid%20plaques">amyloid plaques</a> and <a href="neurofibrillary%20tangle">neurofibrillary tangle</a>s are clearly visible by <a href="microscopy">microscopy</a> in brains of those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly <a href="insoluble">insoluble</a> deposits of <a href="beta-amyloid">beta-amyloid</a> <a href="peptide">peptide</a> and <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">cellular</a> material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau which has become hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles as a consequence of ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. <a href="Lewy%20body">Lewy bodies</a> are not rare in the brains of people with AD.

Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a <a href="protein%20folding">protein misfolding</a> disease (<a href="proteopathy">proteopathy</a>), caused by <a href="senile%20plaque">plaque</a> accumulation of abnormally folded <a href="amyloid%20beta">amyloid beta</a> protein and <a href="tau%20%28protein%29">tau</a> protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s, 39–43 <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s in length, called <a href="amyloid%20beta">amyloid beta</a> (A). A is a fragment from the larger <a href="amyloid%20precursor%20protein">amyloid precursor protein</a> (APP). APP is a <a href="transmembrane%20protein">transmembrane protein</a> that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, <a href="gamma%20secretase">gamma secretase</a> and <a href="beta-secretase%201">beta secretase</a> act together in a <a href="proteolysis">proteolytic</a> process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as <a href="senile%20plaques">senile plaques</a>.

AD is also considered a <a href="tauopathy">tauopathy</a> due to abnormal aggregation of the <a href="tau%20protein">tau protein</a>. Every neuron has a <a href="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a>, an internal support structure partly made up of structures called <a href="microtubules">microtubules</a>. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the <a href="axon">axon</a> and back. A protein called "tau" stabilises the microtubules when <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylated</a>, and is therefore called a <a href="microtubule-associated%20protein">microtubule-associated protein</a>. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming <a href="Hyperphosphorylation">hyperphosphorylated</a>; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating <a href="neurofibrillary%20tangle">neurofibrillary tangle</a>s and disintegrating the neuron's transport system. Pathogenic tau can also cause neuronal death through <a href="transposable%20element">transposable element</a> dysregulation.

Exactly how disturbances of production and aggregation of the beta-amyloid peptide give rise to the pathology of AD is not known.
The amyloid hypothesis traditionally points to the accumulation of beta-amyloid <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid <a href="fibril">fibril</a>s, which are believed to be the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's <a href="calcium">calcium</a> <a href="ion">ion</a> <a href="homeostasis">homeostasis</a>, induces <a href="programmed%20cell%20death">programmed cell death</a> (<a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a>). It is also known that A selectively builds up in the <a href="Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a> in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> functions and the utilisation of <a href="glucose">glucose</a> by neurons.

Various inflammatory processes and <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a>s may also have a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. <a href="Inflammation">Inflammation</a> is a general marker of <a href="Tissue%20%28biology%29">tissue</a> damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response. There is increasing evidence of a strong interaction between the neurons and the immunological mechanisms in the brain. Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progression.

Alterations in the distribution of different <a href="neurotrophic%20factor">neurotrophic factor</a>s and in the expression of their receptors such as the <a href="brain-derived%20neurotrophic%20factor">brain-derived neurotrophic factor</a> (BDNF) have been described in AD.

Alzheimer's disease is usually diagnosed based on the person's <a href="medical%20history">medical history</a>, history from relatives, and behavioural observations. The presence of characteristic <a href="Neurology">neurological</a> and <a href="neuropsychology">neuropsychological</a> features and the <a href="Diagnosis%20of%20exclusion">absence of alternative conditions</a> is supportive. Advanced <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a> with <a href="computed%20tomography">computed tomography</a> (CT) or <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI), and with <a href="single-photon%20emission%20computed%20tomography">single-photon emission computed tomography</a> (SPECT) or <a href="positron%20emission%20tomography">positron emission tomography</a> (PET) can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia. Moreover, it may predict conversion from <a href="prodromal">prodromal</a> stages (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's disease.

<a href="Neuropsychological%20assessment">Assessment of intellectual functioning</a> including memory testing can further characterise the state of the disease. Medical organisations have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardise the diagnostic process for practising physicians. The diagnosis can be confirmed with very high accuracy <a href="Autopsy">post-mortem</a> when brain material is available and can be examined <a href="Histology">histologically</a>.

The <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Neurological%20and%20Communicative%20Disorders%20and%20Stroke">National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke</a> (NINCDS) and the <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20Disease%20and%20Related%20Disorders%20Association">Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association</a> (ADRDA, now known as the <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20Association">Alzheimer's Association</a>) established the most commonly used <a href="NINCDS-ADRDA%20Alzheimer%27s%20Criteria">NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria</a> for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of <a href="Developmental%20disability">cognitive impairment</a>, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by <a href="Neuropsychological%20assessment">neuropsychological testing</a> for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A <a href="histopathologic">histopathologic</a> confirmation including a <a href="microscopic">microscopic</a> examination of <a href="brain%20tissue">brain tissue</a> is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good <a href="Reliability%20%28statistics%29">statistical reliability</a> and <a href="Validity%20%28statistics%29">validity</a> have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight intellectual domains are most commonly impaired in AD—<a href="memory">memory</a>, <a href="language">language</a>, <a href="perception">perceptual skills</a>, <a href="attention">attention</a>, <a href="motor%20skill">motor skill</a>s, <a href="orientation%20%28mental%29">orientation</a>, <a href="problem%20solving">problem solving</a> and <a href="executive%20function">executive function</a>al abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the "<a href="Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>" (DSM-IV-TR) published by the <a href="American%20Psychiatric%20Association">American Psychiatric Association</a>.

<a href="Neuropsychological%20test">Neuropsychological test</a>s such as the <a href="mini%E2%80%93mental%20state%20examination">mini–mental state examination</a> (MMSE) are widely used to evaluate the cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis. More comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease. <a href="Neurological%20examination">Neurological examination</a> in early AD will usually provide normal results, except for obvious cognitive impairment, which may not differ from that resulting from other diseases processes, including other causes of dementia.

Further neurological examinations are crucial in the <a href="differential%20diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a> of AD and other diseases. Interviews with family members are also utilised in the assessment of the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, as well as on the decrease, over time, of the person's <a href="mental%20function">mental function</a>. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own <a href="anosognosia">deficits</a>. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.

Supplemental testing provides extra information on some features of the disease or is used to rule out other diagnoses. <a href="Blood%20test">Blood test</a>s can identify other causes for dementia than AD—causes which may, in rare cases, be reversible. It is common to perform <a href="thyroid%20function%20tests">thyroid function tests</a>, assess <a href="Vitamin%20B12">B12</a>, rule out <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>, rule out metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes), assess levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury) and anaemia. (It is also necessary to rule out <a href="delirium">delirium</a>).

<a href="Psychological%20testing">Psychological tests</a> for <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a> are employed, since depression can either be concurrent with AD (see <a href="Depression%20of%20Alzheimer%20disease">Depression of Alzheimer disease</a>), an early sign of cognitive impairment, or even the cause.

Due to low accuracy, the C-PIB-PET scan is not recommended to be used as an early diagnostic tool or for predicting the development of Alzheimer's disease when people show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The use of ¹⁸F-FDG PET scans, as a single test, to identify people who may develop Alzheimer's disease is also not supported by evidence.

There is no definitive evidence to support that any particular measure is effective in preventing AD. Global studies of measures to prevent or delay the onset of AD have often produced inconsistent results.
Epidemiological studies have proposed relationships between certain modifiable factors, such as diet, cardiovascular risk, pharmaceutical products, or intellectual activities among others, and a population's likelihood of developing AD. Only further research, including clinical trials, will reveal whether these factors can help to prevent AD.

Although cardiovascular risk factors, such as <a href="hypercholesterolemia">hypercholesterolaemia</a>, <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a>, <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>, and <a href="smoking">smoking</a>, are associated with a higher risk of onset and course of AD, <a href="statin">statin</a>s, which are <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> lowering drugs, have not been effective in preventing or improving the course of the disease.

Long-term usage of <a href="non-steroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drugs">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</a> (NSAIDs) were thought in 2007 to be associated with a reduced likelihood of developing AD. Evidence also suggested the notion that NSAIDs could reduce <a href="chronic%20inflammation">inflammation</a> related to <a href="amyloid%20plaque">amyloid plaque</a>s, but trials were suspended due to high adverse events. No prevention trial has been completed. They do not appear to be useful as a treatment, but were thought to be candidates as presymptomatic preventatives. <a href="Hormone%20replacement%20therapy%20%28menopause%29">Hormone replacement therapy in menopause</a>, although previously used, may increase the risk of dementia.

People who engage in intellectual activities such as <a href="reading%20%28process%29">reading</a>, playing <a href="board%20games">board games</a>, completing <a href="crossword%20puzzle">crossword puzzle</a>s, playing <a href="musical%20instrument">musical instrument</a>s, or regular <a href="social%20interaction">social interaction</a> show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease. This is compatible with the <a href="cognitive%20reserve">cognitive reserve</a> theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations. <a href="Education">Education</a> delays the onset of AD syndrome without changing the duration of the disease. Learning a <a href="second%20language">second language</a> even later in life seems to delay getting Alzheimer disease.
<a href="Physical%20activity">Physical activity</a> is also associated with a reduced risk of AD. Physical exercise is associated with decreased rate of dementia. Physical exercise is also effective in reducing symptom severity in those with Alzheimers.

People who maintain a <a href="healthy%20diet">healthy</a>, <a href="japanese%20cuisine">Japanese</a>, or <a href="Mediterranean%20diet">Mediterranean diet</a> have a reduced risk of AD. A Mediterranean diet may improve outcomes in those with the disease. Those who eat a diet high in <a href="saturated%20fats">saturated fats</a> and simple carbohydrates (<a href="monosaccharide">mono-</a> and <a href="disaccharide">disaccharide</a>) have a higher risk. The Mediterranean diet's beneficial cardiovascular effect has been proposed as the mechanism of action.
Conclusions on dietary components have at times been difficult to ascertain as results have differed between population-based studies and randomised controlled trials. There is limited evidence that light to moderate use of alcohol, particularly <a href="red%20wine">red wine</a>, is associated with lower risk of AD. There is tentative evidence that <a href="caffeine">caffeine</a> may be protective. A number of foods high in <a href="flavonoid">flavonoid</a>s such as <a href="cocoa%20bean">cocoa</a>, red wine, and <a href="tea">tea</a> may decrease the risk of AD.
Reviews on the use of <a href="vitamin">vitamin</a>s and minerals have not found enough consistent evidence to recommend them. This includes vitamin A, C, the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E, <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, and folic acid with or without vitamin B. Evidence from one randomized controlled trial indicated that the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E may slow cognitive decline, this evidence was judged to be "moderate" in quality. Trials examining <a href="folic%20acid">folic acid</a> (B9) and other B vitamins failed to show any significant association with cognitive decline. Omega-3 fatty acid supplements from plants and fish, and dietary <a href="docosahexaenoic%20acid">docosahexaenoic acid</a> (DHA), do not appear to benefit people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
<a href="Curcumin">Curcumin</a> had not shown benefit in people even though there is tentative evidence in animals. There was inconsistent and unconvincing evidence that <a href="ginkgo%20biloba">ginkgo</a> has any positive effect on cognitive impairment and dementia. there was no concrete evidence that <a href="cannabinoid">cannabinoid</a>s are effective in improving the symptoms of AD or dementia; however, some research into endocannabinoids looked promising.

There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease; available treatments offer relatively small symptomatic benefit but remain <a href="palliative%20care">palliative</a> in nature. Current treatments can be divided into pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving.

Five medications are currently used to treat the cognitive problems of AD: four are <a href="acetylcholinesterase%20inhibitor">acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</a>s (<a href="tacrine">tacrine</a>, <a href="rivastigmine">rivastigmine</a>, <a href="galantamine">galantamine</a> and <a href="donepezil">donepezil</a>) and the other (<a href="memantine">memantine</a>) is an <a href="NMDA%20receptor%20antagonist">NMDA receptor antagonist</a>. The benefit from their use is small. No medication has been clearly shown to delay or halt the progression of the disease.

Reduction in the activity of the <a href="cholinergic">cholinergic</a> neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which <a href="acetylcholine">acetylcholine</a> (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. The use of these drugs in <a href="mild%20cognitive%20impairment">mild cognitive impairment</a> has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common <a href="adverse%20drug%20reaction">side effects</a> are <a href="nausea">nausea</a> and <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a>, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle <a href="cramp">cramp</a>s, decreased <a href="heart%20rate">heart rate</a> (<a href="bradycardia">bradycardia</a>), decreased <a href="appetite">appetite</a> and weight, and increased <a href="gastric%20acid">gastric acid</a> production.

<a href="Glutamate">Glutamate</a> is an excitatory <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> of the <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a>, although excessive amounts in the <a href="brain">brain</a> can lead to <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a> death through a process called <a href="excitotoxicity">excitotoxicity</a> which consists of the overstimulation of glutamate <a href="Receptor%20%28biochemistry%29">receptors</a>. Excitotoxicity occurs not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also in other neurological diseases such as <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a> and <a href="multiple%20sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a>. <a href="Memantine">Memantine</a> is a noncompetitive <a href="NMDA%20receptor%20antagonist">NMDA receptor antagonist</a> first used as an anti-<a href="influenza">influenza</a> agent. It acts on the <a href="glutamatergic%20system">glutamatergic system</a> by blocking <a href="NMDA%20receptor">NMDA receptor</a>s and inhibiting their overstimulation by glutamate. Memantine has been shown to have a small benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Reported adverse events with memantine are infrequent and mild, including <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>s, <a href="confusion">confusion</a>, <a href="dizziness">dizziness</a>, <a href="headache">headache</a> and <a href="fatigue%20%28medical%29">fatigue</a>. The combination of memantine and donepezil has been shown to be "of <a href="Statistical%20significance">statistically significant</a> but clinically marginal effectiveness".

<a href="Atypical%20antipsychotic">Atypical antipsychotic</a>s are modestly useful in reducing <a href="aggression">aggression</a> and <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a> in people with Alzheimer's disease, but their advantages are offset by serious adverse effects, such as <a href="stroke">stroke</a>, <a href="extra-pyramidal">movement difficulties</a> or cognitive decline. When used in the long-term, they have been shown to associate with increased mortality. Stopping antipsychotic use in this group of people appears to be safe.

<a href="Huperzine%20A">Huperzine A</a> while promising, requires further evidence before its use can be recommended.

<a href="Psychosocial">Psychosocial</a> interventions are used as an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment and can be classified within behaviour-, emotion-, cognition- or stimulation-oriented approaches. Research on efficacy is unavailable and rarely specific to AD, focusing instead on dementia in general.

<a href="Behavior%20modification">Behavioural interventions</a> attempt to identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviours. This approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning, but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviours, such as <a href="Urinary%20incontinence">incontinence</a>. There is a lack of high quality data on the effectiveness of these techniques in other behaviour problems such as wandering. Music therapy is effective in reducing behavioural and psychological symptoms.

Emotion-oriented interventions include <a href="reminiscence%20therapy">reminiscence therapy</a>, <a href="validation%20therapy">validation therapy</a>, supportive <a href="psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a>, <a href="sensory%20integration%20therapy">sensory integration</a>, also called <a href="snoezelen">snoezelen</a>, and <a href="simulated%20presence%20therapy">simulated presence therapy</a>. A Cochrane review has found no evidence that this is effective. Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. A 2018 review of the effectiveness of RT found that effects were inconsistent, small in size and of doubtful clinical significance, and varied by setting. Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on <a href="Attachment%20theory">attachment theories</a> and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce <a href="challenging%20behaviour">challenging behaviour</a>s.
Finally, validation therapy is based on acceptance of the reality and personal truth of another's experience, while sensory integration is based on exercises aimed to stimulate <a href="sense">sense</a>s. There is no evidence to support the usefulness of these therapies.

The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and <a href="Rehabilitation%20%28neuropsychology%29">cognitive retraining</a>, is the reduction of <a href="cognitive%20deficit">cognitive deficit</a>s. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities, although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.

Stimulation-oriented treatments include <a href="Art%20therapy">art</a>, <a href="Music%20therapy%20for%20Alzheimer%27s%20disease">music</a> and <a href="Animal-assisted%20therapy">pet</a> therapies, <a href="Physical%20therapy">exercise</a>, and any other kind of <a href="Recreational%20therapy">recreational activities</a>. Stimulation has modest support for improving behaviour, mood, and, to a lesser extent, function. Nevertheless, as important as these effects are, the main support for the use of stimulation therapies is the change in the person's routine. The efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation and invasive brain stimulation in AD remains uncertain.

Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it gradually renders people incapable of tending for their own needs, caregiving is essentially the treatment and must be carefully managed over the course of the disease.

During the early and moderate stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase <a href="patient%20safety">patient safety</a> and reduce caretaker burden. Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labelling of household items to cue the person with the disease or the use of modified daily life objects. If eating becomes problematic, food will need to be prepared in smaller pieces or even pureed. When <a href="Dysphagia">swallowing difficulties</a> arise, the use of <a href="feeding%20tube">feeding tube</a>s may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members. The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers.

As the disease progresses, different medical issues can appear, such as <a href="dental%20disease">oral and dental disease</a>, <a href="Bedsore">pressure ulcers</a>, <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a>, <a href="hygiene">hygiene</a> problems, or <a href="Respiratory%20system">respiratory</a>, <a href="human%20skin">skin</a>, or <a href="human%20eye">eye</a> <a href="infection">infection</a>s. Careful management can prevent them, while professional treatment is needed when they do arise. During the final stages of the disease, treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death, often with the help of <a href="hospice">hospice</a>.

The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.

<a href="Life%20expectancy">Life expectancy</a> of people with AD is reduced. Following diagnosis it typically ranges from three to ten years.

Fewer than 3% of people live more than fourteen years. Disease features significantly associated with reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, history of falls, and disturbances in the neurological examination. Other coincident diseases such as <a href="Cardiovascular%20disease">heart problems</a>, <a href="Diabetes%20mellitus">diabetes</a> or history of <a href="alcohol%20abuse">alcohol abuse</a> are also related with shortened survival. While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years, life expectancy is particularly reduced when compared to the healthy population among those who are younger. Men have a less favourable survival prognosis than women.

<a href="Pneumonia">Pneumonia</a> and <a href="dehydration">dehydration</a> are the most frequent immediate causes of death brought by AD, while <a href="cancer">cancer</a> is a less frequent cause of death than in the general population.
Two main measures are used in <a href="epidemiology">epidemiological</a> studies: incidence and prevalence. <a href="Incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">Incidence</a> is the number of new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years); while <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time.

Regarding incidence, <a href="cohort%20study">cohort</a> <a href="longitudinal%20studies">longitudinal studies</a> (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD, which means that half of new dementia cases each year are AD. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every five years after the age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also sex differences in the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. In the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, the risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.
Prevalence of AD in populations is dependent upon different factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include the mean age of the population of interest. In the United States, Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in 2000 both overall and in the 65–74 age group, with the rate increasing to 19% in the 75–84 group and to 42% in the greater than 84 group. Prevalence rates in less developed regions are lower. The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> estimated that in 2005, 0.379% of people worldwide had dementia, and that the prevalence would increase to 0.441% in 2015 and to 0.556% in 2030. Other studies have reached similar conclusions. Another study estimated that in 2006, 0.40% of the world population (range 0.17–0.89%; absolute number , range ) were afflicted by AD, and that the prevalence rate would triple and the absolute number would quadruple by 2050.

The <a href="Classical%20antiquity">ancient Greek and Roman</a> <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a>s and <a href="physician">physician</a>s associated old age with increasing <a href="dementia">dementia</a>. It was not until 1901 that German <a href="psychiatry">psychiatrist</a> <a href="Alois%20Alzheimer">Alois Alzheimer</a> identified the first case of what became known as Alzheimer's disease, named after him, in a fifty-year-old woman he called <a href="Auguste%20D">Auguste D</a>. He followed her case until she died in 1906, when he first reported publicly on it. During the next five years, eleven similar cases were reported in the <a href="medical%20literature">medical literature</a>, some of them already using the term Alzheimer's disease. The disease was first described as a distinctive disease by <a href="Emil%20Kraepelin">Emil Kraepelin</a> after suppressing some of the clinical (delusions and hallucinations) and pathological features (arteriosclerotic changes) contained in the original report of Auguste D. He included "Alzheimer's disease", also named "presenile" <a href="dementia">dementia</a> by Kraepelin, as a subtype of "senile dementia" in the eighth edition of his "Textbook of Psychiatry", published on 1910.

For most of the 20th century, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals between the ages of 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and <a href="pathological">pathological</a> manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not rule out the possibility that they had different causes. This eventually led to the diagnosis of "Alzheimer's disease" independent of age. The term "senile dementia of the Alzheimer type" (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical <a href="nomenclature">nomenclature</a> to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and <a href="neuropathology">neuropathology</a>.

Dementia, and specifically Alzheimer's disease, may be among the most costly diseases for society in <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, while their costs in other countries such as <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, and <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>, are also high and rising. These costs will probably increase with the ageing of society, becoming an important <a href="social%20issue">social problem</a>. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as <a href="nursing%20home%20care">nursing home care</a>, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home <a href="day%20care">day care</a>, and indirect costs such as lost <a href="productivity">productivity</a> of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160 billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100 billion each year.

The greatest origin of costs for society is the <a href="long-term%20care">long-term care</a> by <a href="Health%20care%20provider">health care professionals</a> and particularly <a href="institutionalisation">institutionalisation</a>, which corresponds to 2/3 of the total costs for society. <a href="Cost-of-living%20index">The cost of living</a> at home is also very high, especially when informal costs for the family, such as caregiving time and caregiver's lost earnings, are taken into account.

Costs increase with dementia severity and the presence of behavioural disturbances, and are related to the increased caregiving time required for the provision of physical care. Therefore, any treatment that slows cognitive decline, delays institutionalisation or reduces caregivers' hours will have economic benefits. Economic evaluations of current treatments have shown positive results.

The role of the main <a href="Caregiving%20and%20dementia">caregiver</a> is often taken by the spouse or a close relative. Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on <a href="caregiver">caregiver</a>s which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects. Home care is usually preferred by people with AD and their families. This option also delays or eliminates the need for more professional and costly levels of care. Nevertheless, two-thirds of nursing home residents have dementias.

<a href="Depression%20of%20Alzheimer%20disease">Dementia</a> caregivers are subject to high rates of physical and <a href="mental%20disorder">mental</a> disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and <a href="social%20isolation">social isolation</a>. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 per year in the United States, depending on the study.

<a href="Cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy">Cognitive behavioural therapy</a> and the teaching of <a href="Coping%20%28psychology%29">coping strategies</a> either individually or in group have demonstrated their efficacy in improving caregivers' psychological health.

AD has been portrayed in films such as: "<a href="Iris%20%282001%20film%29">Iris</a>" (2001), based on <a href="John%20Bayley%20%28writer%29">John Bayley</a>'s memoir of his wife Iris Murdoch; "<a href="The%20Notebook%20%282004%20film%29">The Notebook</a>" (2004), based on <a href="Nicholas%20Sparks">Nicholas Sparks</a>' 1996 <a href="The%20Notebook%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a>; "<a href="A%20Moment%20to%20Remember">A Moment to Remember</a>" (2004);"<a href="Thanmathra">Thanmathra</a>" (2005); "<a href="Memories%20of%20Tomorrow%20%28Ashita%20no%20Kioku%29">Memories of Tomorrow (Ashita no Kioku)</a>" (2006), based on Hiroshi Ogiwara's novel of the same name; "<a href="Away%20from%20Her">Away from Her</a>" (2006), based on <a href="Alice%20Munro">Alice Munro</a>'s <a href="short%20story">short story</a> "<a href="Hateship%2C%20Friendship%2C%20Courtship%2C%20Loveship%2C%20Marriage">The Bear Came over the Mountain</a>"; "<a href="Still%20Alice">Still Alice</a>" (2014), about a <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> professor who has early onset Alzheimer's disease, based on <a href="Lisa%20Genova">Lisa Genova</a>'s <a href="Still%20Alice%20%28novel%29">2007 novel of the same name</a> and featuring <a href="Julianne%20Moore">Julianne Moore</a> in the title role. Documentaries on Alzheimer's disease include "Malcolm and Barbara: A Love Story" (1999) and "Malcolm and Barbara: Love's Farewell" (2007), both featuring <a href="Malcolm%20Pointon">Malcolm Pointon</a>.

In the decade 2002–2012, 244 compounds were assessed in Phase I, Phase II, or Phase III trials, and only one of these (<a href="memantine">memantine</a>) received <a href="FDA">FDA</a> approval (though others were still in the pipeline). <a href="Solanezumab">Solanezumab</a> failed to show effectiveness in patients who already had Alzheimer's symptoms.

One area of clinical research is focused on treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of <a href="beta-amyloid">beta-amyloid</a> levels is a common target of compounds (such as <a href="apomorphine">apomorphine</a>) under investigation. <a href="Immunotherapy">Immunotherapy</a> or <a href="vaccination">vaccination</a> for the amyloid protein is one <a href="treatment%20modality">treatment modality</a> under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy would be used to treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training <a href="Immune%20system">the immune system</a> to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is <a href="bapineuzumab">bapineuzumab</a>, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, <a href="Immunotherapy">immunotherapeutic</a> agents have been found to cause some concerning <a href="adverse%20drug%20reaction">adverse drug reaction</a>s, such as <a href="amyloid-related%20imaging%20abnormalities">amyloid-related imaging abnormalities</a>. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as <a href="PBT2">PBT2</a>. A <a href="tumor%20necrosis%20factor-alpha">TNFα</a> receptor-blocking <a href="fusion%20protein">fusion protein</a>, <a href="etanercept">etanercept</a> has showed encouraging results.

In 2008, two separate clinical trials showed positive results in modifying the course of disease in mild to moderate AD with <a href="methylthioninium%20chloride">methylthioninium chloride</a>, a drug that inhibits tau aggregation, and <a href="dimebon">dimebon</a>, an <a href="antihistamine">antihistamine</a>.
The consecutive phase-III trial of dimebon failed to show positive effects in the primary and secondary endpoints. Work with methylthioninium chloride showed that bioavailability of methylthioninium from the gut was affected by feeding and by stomach acidity, leading to unexpectedly variable dosing. A new stabilised formulation, as the <a href="prodrug">prodrug</a> <a href="LMTX">LMTX</a>, is in phase-III trials (in 2014).

Preliminary research on the effects of meditation on retrieving memory and cognitive functions have been encouraging. A 2015 review suggests that <a href="mindfulness">mindfulness</a>-based interventions may prevent or delay the onset of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

Rare cases of possible <a href="Transmission%20%28medicine%29">transmission</a> between people are being studied, e.g. to <a href="human%20growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a> patients.

The <a href="herpes%20simplex">herpes simplex</a> virus HSV-1 has been found in the same areas as amyloid plaques. This suggested the possibility that AD could be treated or prevented with <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral</a> medication. Studies of antivirals in <a href="cell%20cultures">cell cultures</a> have shown promising results.

Fungal infection of AD brain has also been described.
This hypothesis was proposed by the <a href="Microbiology">microbiologist</a> L. Carrasco when his group found statistical correlation between disseminated mycoses and AD.
Further work revealed that fungal infection is present in different brain regions of AD patients, but not in the control individuals.

A fungal infection explains the symptoms observed in AD patients. The slow progression of AD fits with the chronic nature of some systemic fungal infections, which can be asymptomatic and thus, unnoticed and untreated.
The fungal hypotheses are also compatible with some other established AD hypotheses, like the amyloid hypothesis, that can be explained as an immune system response to an infection in the <a href="Central%20nervous%20system">CNS</a>, as found by R. Moir and R. Tanzi in mouse and worm models of AD.

Of the many <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a> techniques available, <a href="single%20photon%20emission%20computed%20tomography">single photon emission computed tomography</a> (SPECT) appears to be superior in differentiating Alzheimer's disease from other types of dementia, and this has been shown to give a greater level of accuracy compared with mental testing and <a href="medical%20history">medical history</a> analysis. Advances have led to the proposal of new diagnostic criteria.

<a href="Pittsburgh%20compound%20B">PiB PET</a> remains investigational, but a similar PET scanning <a href="radiopharmaceutical">radiopharmaceutical</a> called <a href="florbetapir">florbetapir</a>, containing the longer-lasting radionuclide <a href="fluorine-18">fluorine-18</a>, is a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease.

Amyloid imaging is likely to be used in conjunction with other markers rather than as an alternative. Volumetric <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">MRI</a> can detect changes in the size of brain regions. Measuring those regions that atrophy during the progress of Alzheimer's disease is showing promise as a diagnostic indicator. It may prove less expensive than other imaging methods currently under study.

In 2011 An FDA panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of <a href="18F-AV-45">florbetapir</a>. The imaging agent can help to detect Alzheimer's brain plaques. A negative scan indicates sparse or no plaques, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of AD.

Emphasis in Alzheimer's research has been placed on diagnosing the condition before symptoms begin. A number of biochemical tests have been developed to enable earlier detection. Some such tests involve the analysis of <a href="cerebrospinal%20fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</a> for beta-amyloid, total tau protein and phosphorylated tau protein concentrations. Because drawing CSF can be painful, repeated draws are avoided. A blood test for circulatory miRNA and inflammatory biomarkers is a potential alternative indicator.

SS Montanan

SS "Montanan was a <a href="cargo%20ship">cargo ship</a> built in 1912 for the <a href="American-Hawaiian%20Steamship%20Company">American-Hawaiian Steamship Company</a>. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> service for the United States <a href="Army%20Transport%20Service">Army Transport Service</a>, she was known as USAT "Montanan. "Montanan" was built by the <a href="Maryland%20Steel%20Company">Maryland Steel Company</a> as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was employed in inter-coastal service via the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a> and the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> after it opened.

In World War I, USAT "Montanan" carried cargo and animals to France, and was in the first American convoy to sail to France after the United States entered the war in April 1917. USAT "Montanan" was torpedoed and sunk by west of <a href="Le%20Verdon-sur-Mer">Le Verdon-sur-Mer</a>, France, while it took part in another eastbound convoy in August 1918, Of the 86 men aboard the ship, 81 were rescued by a convoy escort; five men died in the attack.

In September 1911, the <a href="American-Hawaiian%20Steamship%20Company">American-Hawaiian Steamship Company</a> placed an order with the <a href="Maryland%20Steel%20Company">Maryland Steel Company</a> of <a href="Sparrows%20Point%2C%20Maryland">Sparrows Point, Maryland</a>, for four new <a href="cargo%20ships">cargo ships</a>—, , "Montanan", and . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum cost of $640,000 per ship. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5% down payment in cash, with nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal had provisions that allowed some of the nine installments to be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of "Montanan", including financing costs, was $73.62 per <a href="deadweight%20tonnage">deadweight ton</a>, which came out to just over $692,000.

"Montanan" (Maryland Steel yard no. 126) was the second ship built under the original contract. She was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 25 January 1913, and delivered to American-Hawaiian in April. "Montanan" was , and was in length and <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">abeam</a>. She had a <a href="deadweight%20tonnage">deadweight tonnage</a> of , and her cargo holds, which had a storage capacity of , were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so that she could carry perishable products from the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>—such as fresh produce from <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a> farms—to the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a>. "Montanan" had a single <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a> powered by oil-fired <a href="boiler">boiler</a>s which drove a single <a href="screw%20propeller">screw propeller</a> at a speed of .

When "Montanan" began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> ports via the <a href="Tehuantepec%20Route">Tehuantepec Route</a> to <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route arrived at Mexican ports—<a href="Salina%20Cruz">Salina Cruz, Oaxaca</a>, for eastbound cargo, and <a href="Coatzacoalcos">Coatzacoalcos</a>, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and traversed the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a> on the <a href="Tehuantepec%20National%20Railway">Tehuantepec National Railway</a>. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. "Montanan" sailed in this service on the east side of North America.

While headed from New York to Coatzacoalcos in October 1913, "Montanan" ran aground on <a href="Mantanilla%20Reef">Mantanilla Reef</a>, north of <a href="The%20Bahamas">The Bahamas</a>. Answering "Montanan"s distress calls, the <a href="Standard%20Oil%20Company">Standard Oil Company</a> <a href="tanker%20%28ship%29">tanker</a> "Rayo" assisted in freeing "Montanan" from the reef. Although she was leaking slightly, "Montanan" continued on to her destination, and put in for repairs after a return trip to New York.

Following the <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Veracruz">United States occupation of Veracruz</a> on 21 April 1914 (which took place while six American-Hawaiian ships were being held in various Mexican ports), the <a href="Victoriano%20Huerta">Huerta</a>-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, coupled with the fact that the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via the <a href="Straits%20of%20Magellan">Straits of Magellan</a> in late April. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to the canal route.

On 2 December, "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" reported an incident involving "Montanan". While headed down the Pacific coast of Mexico with a cargo of dried fruits and canned goods, "Montanan" was approached by a <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a> warship, which fired a warning shot for "Montanan" to stop. After doing so, a boarding party with Japanese officers in a <a href="launch%20%28boat%29">launch</a> headed to "Montanan". When the American identity of "Montanan" was established to the satisfaction of the Japanese, they returned to their ship without boarding "Montanan". The news report did not identify the type or the name of the Japanese warship, which had been searching for a German vessel thought to be operating in the area.

On "Montanan"s next trip, the ship collided with a wharf in <a href="Port%20of%20Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles Harbor</a>. "Montanan" had arrived in Los Angeles from <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a> on 22 January 1915 to complete her load before sailing for New York and Boston. The almost fully loaded ship was slow to respond to the helm and ended up "ploughing through" of Municipal Pier A on <a href="Mormon%20Island%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Mormon Island</a> channel before coming to a stop at a stone bulkhead. One <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> plate on "Montanan" was dented, but the ship was otherwise undamaged. "Montanan"s captain, who had a local license, did not take on a <a href="harbor%20pilot">harbor pilot</a> and American-Hawaiian was liable for the damage, estimated by the harbor engineer to be $2,500.

Contemporary news reports offer hints at cargoes that "Montanan" carried during this period. In April 1915, the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" reported on the sailing of "Montanan" with a full cargo. The majority of the cargo was rice—from Japan, China, and California—which was destined for the United Kingdom to feed Indian troops fighting in Europe. In June, "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" reported that "Montanan" and (of the <a href="Grace%20Line">Grace Line</a>) had sailed from <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma, Washington</a>, with 2,500 tons of copper between them.

In October 1915, landslides closed the Panama Canal and all American-Hawaiian ships, including "Montanan", returned to the Straits of Magellan route again. "Montanan"s exact movements from this time through early 1917 are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was <a href="ship%20chartering">chartered</a> for transatlantic service, or she may have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>s, cocoa, rubber, and <a href="manganese">manganese ore</a>.

After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army—needing transports to get its men and <a href="materiel">materiel</a> to France—had a select committee of shipping executives pore over registries of American shipping. The committee selected "Montanan", her sister ship "Dakotan", and 12 other American-flagged ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough fuel in their <a href="%3Awikt%3Abunker">bunker</a>s for <a href="transatlantic%20crossing">transatlantic crossing</a>s, and, most importantly, were in port or not far at sea. After "Montanan" discharged her last load of cargo, she was officially handed over to the Army on 29 May.

Before troop transportation began, all of the ships were hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, four, including "Montanan" and "Dakotan", were designated to carry animals and other cargo; the other ten were designated to carry troops. Ramps and stalls were built on the four ships chosen to carry livestock. Gun platforms were installed on each ship before docking at the <a href="Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a>, where the guns were put in place. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, <a href="quartermaster">quartermaster</a>s, <a href="signalman%20%28rank%29">signalmen</a>, and <a href="radio">wireless</a> operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.

The American convoy carrying the first units of the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Force">American Expeditionary Force</a> was separated into four groups; "Montanan" was in the fourth group with her sister ship "Dakotan", Army transports and , and escorts consisting of <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> , U.S. Navy transport , and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s , , and . "Montanan" departed with her group on the morning of 17 June for <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>, France, steaming at an pace. A thwarted submarine attack on the first convoy group, and reports of heavy submarine activity off of Brest, resulted in a change in the convoy's destination to <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a> where the convoy arrived 2 July.

"Montanan" departed Saint-Nazaire on 14 July in the company of her convoy mates "El Occidente", "Dakotan", and "Edward Luckenbach". Joining the return trip were Army transport , Navy armed <a href="Collier%20%28ship%29">collier</a> , Navy <a href="Oiler%20%28ship%29">oiler</a> , and <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> , the flagship of <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Albert%20Gleaves">Albert Gleaves</a>, the head of the Navy's <a href="Cruiser%20and%20Transport%20Force">Cruiser and Transport Force</a>.

Sources do not reveal "Montanan"s movements over the next months, but on 1 August 1918, "Montanan" sailed in Convoy HB-8 with U.S. Navy cargo ships , , and 13 others for France. Escorted by armed yacht , destroyers and , and French cruiser , the convoy was west of its destination of <a href="Le%20Verdon-sur-Mer">Le Verdon-sur-Mer</a> by the end of the day on 15 August. At sundown, shortly before 18:00, German submarine launched three torpedoes at "Montanan". The first two, spotted by lookouts aboard "Montanan", missed, but a third, unseen torpedo struck "Montanan" amidships on her port side, opening a large hole. "Montanan" began to settle and was abandoned quickly. Two of "Montanan"s <a href="Naval%20Armed%20Guard">Naval Armed Guard</a>smen drowned when their lifeboat capsized in the heavy seas; three of her civilian crewmen also died in the attack. "Montanan"s 81 survivors were rescued by convoy escort "Noma".
Shortly after "Montanan" was attacked, "West Bridge", which had previously developed engine trouble and was drifting, was torpedoed by and abandoned. By the morning of 16 August both "Montanan" and "West Bridge", with decks awash, were still afloat some apart. "Montanan"s captain and several officers reboarded the ship the next morning for an attempt to get her under tow, but despite their efforts, the ship sank later that morning.

Science-Fiction Plus

Science-Fiction Plus was an American <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a> published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a> for seven issues in 1953. In 1926, Gernsback had launched "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>," the first science fiction magazine, but he had not been involved in the genre since 1936, when he sold "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Wonder Stories</a>". "Science-Fiction Plus" was initially in <a href="Slick%20%28magazine%20format%29">slick</a> format, meaning that it was large-size and printed on glossy paper. Gernsback had always believed in the educational power of science fiction, and he continued to advocate his views in the new magazine's editorials. The managing editor, <a href="Sam%20Moskowitz">Sam Moskowitz</a>, had been a reader of the early <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a>s, and published many writers who had been popular before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, such as <a href="Raymond%20Z.%20Gallun">Raymond Z. Gallun</a>, <a href="Eando%20Binder">Eando Binder</a>, and <a href="Harry%20Bates%20%28author%29">Harry Bates</a>. Combined with Gernsback's earnest editorials, the use of these early writers gave the magazine an anachronistic feel.

Sales were initially good, but soon fell. For the last two issues Gernsback switched the magazine to cheaper pulp paper, but the magazine remained unprofitable. The final issue was dated December 1953.

In addition to the older writers he published, Moskowitz was able to obtain fiction from some of the better-known writers of the day, including <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford Simak</a>, <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>, <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>, and <a href="Philip%20Jos%C3%A9%20Farmer">Philip José Farmer</a>, and some of their stories were well-received, including "Spacebred Generations", by Simak, "Strange Compulsion", by Farmer, and "Nightmare Planet", by Leinster. He also published several new writers, but only one, <a href="Anne%20McCaffrey">Anne McCaffrey</a>, went on to a successful career in the field. Science fiction historians consider the magazine a failed attempt to reproduce the early days of the science fiction pulps.

The first science fiction (sf) magazine, "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", was launched in 1926 by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a> at the height of the <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> era. It helped to form science fiction as a separately marketed genre, and although Gernsback lost control of "Amazing Stories" in a <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> in 1929, he quickly started several more sf magazines, including "<a href="Air%20Wonder%20Stories">Air Wonder Stories</a>" and "<a href="Science%20Wonder%20Stories">Science Wonder Stories</a>". The two magazines were soon combined as "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Wonder Stories</a>", which lasted until 1936, when Gernsback sold it to <a href="Ned%20Pines">Ned Pines</a> of <a href="Beacon%20Magazines">Beacon Magazines</a>. Gernsback remained in the publishing business as proprietor of several profitable magazines, but he did not return to the sf field for nearly seventeen years, when "Science-Fiction Plus" appeared.

Gernsback hired <a href="Sam%20Moskowitz">Sam Moskowitz</a> to edit the new magazine, and produced a dummy issue in November 1952 that was never distributed or intended for sale; it was printed for trademark purposes, and contained only stories by Gernsback himself, under his own name and several pseudonyms. The first issue produced for sale was dated March 1953. It was a <a href="Slick%20%28magazine%20format%29">slick</a>, meaning that it was in large format and was printed on high-quality paper; this was a step up from the cheap paper used in the leading science fiction magazines of the day, and sf historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> notes that in theory this should have given Gernsback a marketing edge. The price, 35 cents, was also competitive. Sales were initially good, and "Science-Fiction Plus" remained on a monthly schedule until June, but when the circulation began to slip, the magazine became bimonthly beginning with the August issue. Gernsback distributed "Science-Fiction Plus" along with his technical magazines, and if the circulation of the new magazine had been comparable to that of his other titles, it would have been profitable despite the more expensive slick paper, but sales were insufficient for it to continue. In October Gernsback cut costs by switching to cheaper <a href="Pulp%20%28paper%29">pulp</a> paper, but only one further issue, dated December 1953, appeared.

Gernsback believed from the beginning of his involvement with science fiction in the 1920s that the stories should be instructive, although it was not long before he found it necessary to print fantastical and unscientific fiction in "Amazing Stories" to attract readers. During Gernsback's long absence from sf publishing, from 1936 to 1953, the field evolved away from his focus on facts and education. The <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Science%20Fiction">Golden Age of Science Fiction</a> is generally considered to have started in the late 1930s and lasted until the mid-1940s, bringing with it "a quantum jump in quality, perhaps the greatest in the history of the genre", according to science fiction historians <a href="Peter%20Nicholls%20%28writer%29">Peter Nicholls</a> and Mike Ashley. However, Gernsback's views were unchanged. In his editorial in the first issue of "Science-Fiction Plus", he gave his view of the modern sf story: "the fairy tale brand, the weird or fantastic type of what mistakenly masquerades under the name of Science-Fiction today!" and he stated his preference for "truly scientific, prophetic Science-Fiction with the full accent on SCIENCE". In the same editorial, Gernsback called for <a href="United%20States%20patent%20law">patent reform</a> to give <a href="science%20fiction%20authors">science fiction authors</a> the right to create patents for ideas without having <a href="patent%20model">patent models</a> because many of their ideas predated the technical progress needed to develop <a href="specifications">specifications</a> for their ideas. The introduction referenced the numerous <a href="prescient">prescient</a> technologies described throughout <a href="Ralph%20124C%2041%2B">Ralph 124C 41+</a>.

The managing editor, Sam Moskowitz, also had a long history in the field, having helped organize the <a href="1st%20World%20Science%20Fiction%20Convention">First World Science Fiction Convention</a> in 1939. He too had strong views about what constituted good science fiction, though his views did not always coincide with those of his publisher: Gernsback's focus was on the educational potential of sf, while Moskowitz was a fan of the early writers in the field, from before the Golden Age. Moskowitz was the one in charge of obtaining stories, and he succeeded in acquiring work by many of the best-known names in sf, including <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford Simak</a>, <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>, <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>, <a href="James%20H.%20Schmitz">James H. Schmitz</a>, and <a href="Philip%20Jos%C3%A9%20Farmer">Philip José Farmer</a>, but he also bought many stories by writers from the early years of the genre, such as <a href="Raymond%20Z.%20Gallun">Raymond Gallun</a>, <a href="Eando%20Binder">Eando Binder</a>, and <a href="Harry%20Bates%20%28author%29">Harry Bates</a>. The result was a magazine that both Ashley and fellow sf historian Donald Lawler describe as old-fashioned, despite its smart appearance: in Ashley's words, "Science-Fiction Plus" had "a feeling of archaism", and he adds "for a magazine to be 'slick', it didn't just have to look slick, it had to feel it, but in the case of "Science-Fiction Plus" all that glittered clearly was not gold". Lawler agrees, describing the magazine as "an anachronism", and "dull from first to last". As part of Gernsback's attempt to encourage stories that contained plausible scientific predictions, he created a symbol made up of a sphere labeled "SF", with a five-pointed star atop it. He placed the first of these awards on a story of his own, "Exploration of Mars", in the first issue, in what Lawler describes as "a characteristic self-tribute".

Gernsback paid two to three cents per word for fiction, which was competitive with the leading magazines of the day, and despite the magazine's anachronistic approach, Moskowitz was able to publish some well-received stories. Lawler describes Simak's story, "Spacebred Generations", as a "gem", and cites Farmer's "Strange Compulsion" as "the high point in story quality for the entire run". Ashley praises the same two stories, and considers "Nightmare Planet", by Murray Leinster, from the June 1953 issue, as equal in quality. Moskowitz attempted to find and develop new writers, and published the first story by <a href="Anne%20McCaffrey">Anne McCaffrey</a>, "Freedom of the Race", which appeared in the October 1953 issue. However, none of Moskowitz's other new writers lasted in the field, and he rejected McCaffrey's subsequent submissions.

As well as fiction, Gernsback included departments such as "Science Questions and Answers", "Science News Shorts", and other science-related non-fiction; these, like the fiction, were reminiscent of the Gernsback magazines of two decades earlier. In Ashley's opinion, the artwork was of variable quality; <a href="Frank%20R.%20Paul">Frank R. Paul</a>, who had worked with Gernsback on his earlier magazines, appeared in every issue, but although this brought back the ambience of the early science fiction magazines, Paul's work had not improved over the years. Ashley notes that <a href="Alex%20Schomburg">Alex Schomburg</a>, who was also a frequent contributor, did provide some high-quality covers.

The magazine was subtitled Preview of the Future; Sam Moskowitz was the managing editor of all seven issues of "Science-Fiction Plus", and assembled the issues; Gernsback was listed as editor and wrote the editorials. The magazine remained "large pulp" size throughout its run. The first five issues were printed on glossy paper; the final two were pulp. It was priced at 35 cents throughout, and all issues were 64 pages. There are no reprint anthologies from the magazine, nor any foreign editions. In the mid-1950s many stories from "Science-Fiction Plus" were used in early issues of the Australian magazine "<a href="Science-Fiction%20Monthly%20%28Australian%20magazine%29">Science-Fiction Monthly</a>," with the first four issues almost entirely drawn from "Science-Fiction Plus". Several covers and much interior artwork from the magazine were reproduced in a Swedish sf magazine titled <a href="H%C3%A4pna%21">Häpna!</a>, which began publication in 1954.

Intimacy (Bloc Party album)

Intimacy is the third studio album by English <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> band <a href="Bloc%20Party">Bloc Party</a>. It was recorded in two weeks at several locations in London and <a href="Kent">Kent</a> during 2008 and was produced by <a href="Jacknife%20Lee">Jacknife Lee</a> and <a href="Paul%20Epworth">Paul Epworth</a>. The band members made the album available for purchase on their website as a <a href="Music%20download">digital download</a> on 21 August 2008. Minimal promotion was undertaken in the UK. The record was released in compact disc form on 24 October 2008, with <a href="Wichita%20Recordings">Wichita Recordings</a> as the primary label. It peaked at number 8 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> and entered the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> in the United States at number 18.

Bloc Party wanted to create an album that further distanced the band from the traditional rock set-up by incorporating more <a href="Electronic%20music">electronic</a> elements and unconventional musical arrangements. As the record's title suggests, its tracks are about personal relationships and are loosely based on one of <a href="Lead%20vocalist">frontman</a> <a href="Kele%20Okereke">Kele Okereke</a>'s break-ups in 2007. Three songs were released as <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a>: "<a href="Mercury%20%28song%29">Mercury</a>", "<a href="Talons%20%28song%29">Talons</a>", and "<a href="One%20Month%20Off">One Month Off</a>"; the first two tracks entered the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Top 40</a>. "Intimacy" was generally well received by critics. Reviewers often focused on its rush-release and central theme, and considered them either bold steps or poor choices.

Bloc Party's second album "<a href="A%20Weekend%20in%20the%20City">A Weekend in the City</a>", released in 2007, allowed the quartet to evolve sonically by including more electronically tampered soundscapes, but the band members were not entirely comfortable with more daring musical arrangements when making the record. According to multi-instrumentalist <a href="Gordon%20Moakes">Gordon Moakes</a>, the impromptu November 2007 single "<a href="Flux%20%28song%29">Flux</a>" "opened a door to the fact that we could go in any direction" in future works. After the "NME" Big Gig in February 2008, the band members took a month off from touring and did not interact with each other during that period. Moakes felt that there were no rules when the band re-assembled for studio work. Chief lyricist Okereke completed most of the songwriting before the recording process.

In mid-2008, Bloc Party attended secret sessions at studios in the south-east of England. The band aimed to use a similar process to the creation of "Flux", which was crafted in a week. Paul Epworth and Jacknife Lee—from Bloc Party's previous albums, "<a href="Silent%20Alarm">Silent Alarm</a>" and "A Weekend in the City", respectively—returned to the production staff for "Intimacy", because the band members felt that they had "unfinished business" with both. Okereke has stated that having two producers allowed for musical experimentation. Epworth focused on capturing the dynamic of a live band by working on fully developed songs and emphasising the <a href="rhythm%20section">rhythm section</a> in the mix. Lee aided the band members' evolution towards a more electronic style by creating tracks with them. Each producer worked on five of the record's original ten tracks.

According to Okereke, Bloc Party wanted to make something as stylised as <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> or <a href="electronica">electronica</a>, combining the rawness of "Silent Alarm" and the recording experience gained from "A Weekend in the City". The frontman drew inspiration from <a href="Siouxsie%20and%20the%20Banshees">Siouxsie and the Banshees</a>' 1988 song "<a href="Peek-a-Boo%20%28song%29">Peek-a-Boo</a>" and aimed to create "rock interpretations of The band worked by initially performing <a href="soundcheck">soundcheck</a>s with only guitar <a href="Chord%20%28music%29">chords</a>, <a href="Keyboard%20instrument">keyboard</a> notes, and drum beats. Discussing the interplay between rhythm guitarist Okereke and lead guitarist <a href="Russell%20Lissack">Russell Lissack</a>, Epworth has stated that "Kele will do one thing that creates a great deal of impact, whereas Russell's very good at subtle embellishments and leading the melodic side of things outside of the vocal". The band members decided to record the first ten tracks crafted after judging first ideas to often be the best. They "thrived" under the pressure of timed sessions, which lasted only two weeks.

Moakes has indicated that there was no worry about whether a song could be recreated live in concert in the same way as it would appear on record. A <a href="brass%20section">brass section</a> and a <a href="chamber%20choir">chamber choir</a> were hired as additional musicians. <a href="Drum%20machine">Drum machine</a>s and <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">distorted</a> guitars were used more extensively than in Bloc Party's previous works to create a sense of manipulation to the basic rock palette. Drummer Matt Tong was initially sceptical of moulding songs with programmed drums, as opposed to using his physical output, but agreed to the idea when the band recorded some of the tracks in their entirety. On some songs, the guitars were disregarded and the band focused solely on the beat. Okereke's voice was often used as an instrument by being <a href="Loop%20%28music%29">looped</a>, <a href="Vocoder">vocoded</a>, or run through <a href="Effects%20unit">effects pedals</a>.

After the studio sessions, Bloc Party embarked on a tour of North American and European summer festivals. One of the recorded tracks, "Mercury", was released as a single on 11 August 2008 and peaked at number 16 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. At the time, the band confirmed the existence of further material, but noted that a record release date was scheduled for the end of 2008 at the earliest. Bloc Party unexpectedly announced the completion of "Intimacy" on 18 August 2008 via a <a href="webcast">webcast</a> and confirmed a release within 60 hours. The band members wanted to revive the importance of a new album's release in an era in which the excitement has dissipated because of extensive Internet coverage. They were inspired by <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>'s marketing of "<a href="In%20Rainbows">In Rainbows</a>" in 2007, but did not consider a "free" sale option. Little press was undertaken in the UK to promote the record because of Okereke's reluctance to discuss personal aspects of his life.

"Intimacy" was made available for download on Bloc Party's website on 21 August 2008. Ten MP3 tracks were sold with a plain black <a href="JPEG">JPEG</a> cover for £5, and a £10 option for the online songs and the future expanded CD was also available. The album title was picked as a "double bluff" with regard to people's expectations; Okereke has explained, "You'd think of wet <a href="ballad">ballad</a>eering. You don't think it's gonna be ugly or harsh. But that's what relationships are really like. It's not just about good times." The release was called "rushed" by publications such as "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" and "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>". Tong disagreed with the label and stated that Bloc Party wanted to make a statement that was surprising to anyone interested in their work.

The band showcased tracks from "Intimacy" at <a href="Reading%20and%20Leeds%20Festivals">Reading Festival</a> at the end of August 2008 and embarked on a North American tour during September. UK appearances on the <a href="MTV%20Two%20Europe">MTV2</a> Gonzo Tour and the release of the second single, "Talons", preceded the physical release of the album in October, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight. In the U.S, the record sold 24,000 copies during the first week of release and debuted at number 18 on the "Billboard" 200. By August 2012 it had sold 85,000 copies in the United States. Comprehensive sales figures have not been published because the digital download data has not been publicly reported by Bloc Party. The chosen <a href="cover%20art">cover art</a> is a stylised shot of a couple kissing, taken by <a href="Freelancer">freelance</a> photographer Perry Curties. It was ranked at number 23 on <a href="Gigwise">Gigwise</a>'s list of The Best Album Covers of 2008, in which the publication called it "intimate and rather ambiguous".

The lyrics of "Intimacy" were inspired by a relationship break-up Okereke went through at the end of 2007. The lyricist told "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", "I wouldn't want anyone to think it's the clichéd break-up record but I haven't written about true, personal experiences all that much in the past." The move to more intimate subject matter was "semi-conscious" because the band members did not want to focus on socio-political issues as they had in their previous works. Three tracks allude to <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>: "Ares" draws its name from the <a href="Ares">god of war</a>, "Trojan Horse" is named after the <a href="Trojan%20Horse">Trojan War military ruse</a>, and "Zephyrus" draws its name from the <a href="Zephyrus">god of the west wind</a>. The narrative in the songs occurs between two people and focuses on the relations between lovers, friends, and enemies; Okereke indicated that "it's about moments of shared vulnerability". "Better Than Heaven" references the <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Garden of Eden</a> and <a href="1%20Corinthians%2015">Corinthians (15:22)</a>, because the lyricist wanted to explore the themes of sex and death, especially in a biblical context.

"Biko" means "Please" (or more accurately "I implore you") in <a href="Igbo%20language">Igbo</a>—a language spoken in Nigeria, the homeland of Okereke's parents—and is used "when you're beseeching someone to do something". Okereke denied that it is about the murdered South African anti-<a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> protester <a href="Steve%20Biko">Steve Biko</a>. The lyrics of "One Month Off" reference feelings of anger and are about being in love with someone younger and unfaithful, while "Zephyrus" concerns an apology following neglect. The lyrics in the chorus of "Ion Square", the last track on the original download release, are based on <a href="E.%20E.%20Cummings">E. E. Cummings</a>' poem "I Carry Your Heart with Me". Okereke considers the song a personal favourite because it evokes the initial exciting stages of a new relationship when everything is going right.

Okereke has discussed a natural progression in Bloc Party's compositional style to a more explorative, electronic direction. For the opening track on "Intimacy", "Ares", Okereke was inspired to <a href="Rapping">rap</a> his lyrics after listening to the <a href="old-school%20hip%20hop">old-school hip hop</a> of <a href="Afrika%20Bambaataa">Afrika Bambaataa</a>. According to Heather Phares of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, the song includes siren-like guitar chords and loud, complex drumming in the vein of <a href="dance%20music">dance</a> acts <a href="The%20Prodigy">The Prodigy</a> and <a href="The%20Chemical%20Brothers">The Chemical Brothers</a>. "Mercury" continues the complex drumming theme by incorporating layered percussion and contains a vocally manipulated chorus. The track is an attempt at <a href="drum%20and%20bass">drum and bass</a> and features <a href="Brass%20instrument">brass</a> <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonance</a>, effects Okereke has called "harsh, glacial, layered and energetic". "Zephyrus" begins with a solitary vocal line accompanied only by a drum machine pattern, while the <a href="Exmoor%20Singers%20of%20London%20Chamber%20Choir">Exmoor Singers</a> provide <a href="Backing%20vocalist">background vocals</a> in the rest of the composition. "Signs" is the only song that does not include guitars; instead, it is made up of a synthesiser <a href="pulse%20%28music%29">pulse</a> and <a href="Multitrack%20recording">multitracked</a> <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a> of <a href="glockenspiel">glockenspiel</a> and <a href="mbira">mbira</a> resembling the work of <a href="Minimal%20music">minimalist</a> composer <a href="Steve%20Reich">Steve Reich</a>.

Okereke has conceded that "Intimacy" covers Bloc Party's typical indie rock elements, but noted that the guitars have an artificial and manipulated sound, "almost like all the humanity has been bleached out". "Halo" has a fast <a href="tempo">tempo</a> coupled with a guitar melody that uses only four <a href="Chord%20%28music%29">chords</a>, while "Trojan Horse" features <a href="Syncopation">syncopated</a> guitars and distortion. "Talons" also incorporates distortion from both lead and rhythm guitars, while the final single "One Month Off" consists of tribal rhythms and <a href="sixteenth%20note">sixteenth note</a> guitar <a href="Ostinato">riffs</a>. "Biko" has a slower tempo and includes guitar <a href="arpeggio">arpeggi</a> throughout, while "Ion Square" incorporates guitar overdubbing and the use of <a href="hi-hat">hi-hat</a> patterns throughout. According to Nick Southall of <a href="Drowned%20in%20Sound">Drowned in Sound</a>, "Better Than Heaven" encapsulates what Bloc Party had been trying to achieve in their previous works, "namely aligning all their different directional desires: to swoon, to rock, and to experiment all at once". The track features broken beats and layered vocals.

Media response to "Intimacy" was generally favourable; aggregating website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> reports a <a href="Standard%20score">normalised</a> rating of 69% based on 27 critical reviews. Steven Robertshaw of "<a href="Alternative%20Press%20%28magazine%29">Alternative Press</a>" described the album as arguably Bloc Party's finest <a href="Bloc%20Party%20discography">career moment</a> and noted that it offers "sweat and circuitry, savagery and submission, and a captivating energy that's severely lacking in many music scenes on the planet". Kyle Anderson of "Rolling Stone" claimed that by "replacing Bloc Party's distant cool with vivid honesty, Okereke makes "Intimacy" a confident new peak for his band", while <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>' Ross Langager explained that the record "might not actually be all that intimate, but it is a thing of rough, recycled beauty". Adam Mazmanian of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>" commented that the album's final mix showed that producers Epworth and Lee preserved the essence of Bloc Party's signature sound—"<a href="Minor%20scale">minor key</a> rock thrumming with rhythmic intensity"—while taking the band in new musical directions. Dave Simpson of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" concluded that it would please old and new fans alike by being "brave, individual and heartfelt".

<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">"Pitchfork"</a>'s Ian Cohen was less receptive and asserted that the record seems like a document of a band disconnected from its musical strengths. Josh Modell of "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" felt that "Intimacy" sometimes gets "sonically or lyrically precarious", while John Robinson of "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" commented that "there's an air of slightly hedged bets". Drowned in Sound's Nick Southall claimed that the record is not quite the radical statement Bloc Party set out to achieve, but concluded that it is "definitely a little bit of invigorating redemption at a time when doubts were beginning to cloud what was, initially, a flawless reputation". In its year-end music review for 2008, <a href="Under%20the%20Radar%20%28magazine%29">"Under the Radar"</a> stated about the band members, "They are so solid and so confident that it seems inevitable that they will get many chances to slowly drift into more daring lands. But without more risk, they may be destined to make albums like "Intimacy" – accomplished and intriguing, but not life changing, not classic." The record figured in several publications' end-of-year best album lists for 2008—notably, at number 14 by Gigwise, at number 36 by Drowned in Sound, and at number 49 by "<a href="NME">NME</a>".

Analog Science Fiction and Fact

Analog Science Fiction and Fact is an American <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science-fiction magazine</a> published under various titles since 1930. Originally titled Astounding Stories of Super-Science, the first issue was dated January 1930, published by <a href="William%20Clayton%20%28publisher%29">William Clayton</a>, and edited by <a href="Harry%20Bates%20%28author%29">Harry Bates</a>. Clayton went bankrupt in 1933 and the magazine was sold to <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a>. The new editor was <a href="F.%20Orlin%20Tremaine">F. Orlin Tremaine</a>, who soon made "Astounding" the leading magazine in the nascent pulp science fiction field, publishing well-regarded stories such as <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>'s "<a href="Legion%20of%20Space%20Series">Legion of Space</a>" and <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>'s <a href="Twilight%20%28Campbell%20short%20story%29">"Twilight"</a>. At the end of 1937, Campbell took over editorial duties under Tremaine's supervision, and the following year Tremaine was let go, giving Campbell more independence. Over the next few years Campbell published many stories that became classics in the field, including <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s <a href="Foundation%20series">"Foundation" series</a>, <a href="A.%20E.%20van%20Vogt">A.E. van Vogt</a>'s "<a href="Slan">Slan</a>", and several novels and stories by <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>. The period beginning with Campbell's editorship is often referred to as the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Science%20Fiction">Golden Age of Science Fiction</a>.

By 1950, new competition had appeared from "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>" and "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>." Campbell's interest in some <a href="Pseudoscience">pseudo-science</a> topics, such as <a href="dianetics">dianetics</a> (an early version of <a href="scientology">scientology</a>), alienated some of his regular writers, and "Astounding" was no longer regarded as the leader of the field, though it did continue to publish popular and influential stories: <a href="Hal%20Clement">Hal Clement</a>'s novel "<a href="Mission%20of%20Gravity">Mission of Gravity</a>" appeared in 1953, and <a href="Tom%20Godwin">Tom Godwin</a>'s "<a href="The%20Cold%20Equations">The Cold Equations</a>" appeared the following year. In 1960, Campbell changed the title of the magazine to "Analog Science Fiction & Fact"; he had long wanted to get rid of the word "Astounding" in the title, which he felt was too sensational. At about the same time Street & Smith sold the magazine to <a href="Cond%C3%A9%20Nast">Condé Nast</a>. Campbell remained as editor until his death in 1971.

<a href="Ben%20Bova">Ben Bova</a> took over from 1972 to 1978, and the character of the magazine changed noticeably, since Bova was willing to publish fiction that included sexual content and profanity. Bova published stories such as <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>'s "<a href="The%20Gold%20at%20the%20Starbow%27s%20End">The Gold at the Starbow's End</a>", which was nominated for both a <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo</a> and <a href="Nebula%20Award">Nebula</a> Award, and <a href="Joe%20Haldeman">Joe Haldeman</a>'s "Hero", the first story in the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning "<a href="The%20Forever%20War%20series">Forever War</a>" sequence; Pohl had been unable to sell to Campbell, and "Hero" had been rejected by Campbell as unsuitable for the magazine. Bova won five consecutive Hugo Awards for his editing of "Analog".

Bova was followed by <a href="Stanley%20Schmidt">Stanley Schmidt</a>, who continued to publish many of the same authors who had been contributing for years; the result was some criticism of the magazine as stagnant and dull, though Schmidt was initially successful in maintaining circulation. The title was sold to <a href="Davis%20Publications">Davis Publications</a> in 1980, then to <a href="Dell%20Magazines">Dell Magazines</a> in 1992. <a href="Crosstown%20Publications">Crosstown Publications</a> acquired Dell in 1996 and remains the publisher. Schmidt continued to edit the magazine until 2012, when he was replaced by <a href="Trevor%20Quachri">Trevor Quachri</a>.

In 1926, <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a> launched "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", the first science-fiction (sf) magazine. Gernsback had been printing scientific fiction stories for some time in his hobbyist magazines, such as "<a href="Modern%20Electrics">Modern Electrics</a>" and "<a href="Electrical%20Experimenter">Electrical Experimenter</a>", but decided that interest in the genre was sufficient to justify a monthly magazine. "Amazing" was very successful, quickly reaching a circulation over 100,000. <a href="William%20Clayton%20%28publisher%29">William Clayton</a>, a successful and well-respected publisher of several pulp magazines, considered starting a competitive title in 1928; according to <a href="Harold%20Hersey">Harold Hersey</a>, one of his editors at the time, Hersey had "discussed plans with Clayton to launch a pseudo-science fantasy sheet". Clayton was unconvinced, but the following year decided to launch a new magazine, mainly because the sheet on which the color covers of his magazines were printed had a space for one more cover. He suggested to <a href="Harry%20Bates%20%28author%29">Harry Bates</a>, a newly hired editor, that they start a magazine of historical adventure stories. Bates proposed instead a science-fiction pulp, to be titled "Astounding Stories of Super Science", and Clayton agreed.

"Astounding" was initially published by Publisher's Fiscal Corporation, a subsidiary of <a href="Clayton%20Magazines">Clayton Magazines</a>. The first issue appeared in January 1930, with Bates as editor. Bates aimed for straightforward action-adventure stories, with scientific elements only present to provide minimal plausibility. Clayton paid much better rates than "Amazing" and "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Wonder Stories</a>"—two cents a word on acceptance, rather than half a cent a word, on publication (or sometimes later)—and consequently "Astounding" attracted some of the better-known pulp writers, such as <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>, <a href="Victor%20Rousseau%20Emanuel">Victor Rousseau</a>, and <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>. In February 1931, the original name "Astounding Stories of Super-Science" was shortened to "Astounding Stories".

The magazine was profitable, but the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> caused Clayton problems. Normally a publisher would pay a printer three months in arrears, but when a credit squeeze began in May 1931, it led to pressure to reduce this delay. The financial difficulties led Clayton to start alternating the publication of his magazines, and he switched "Astounding" to a bimonthly schedule with the June 1932 issue. Some printers bought the magazines which were indebted to them: Clayton decided to buy his printer to prevent this from happening. This proved a disastrous move. Clayton did not have the money to complete the transaction, and in October 1932, Clayton decided to cease publication of "Astounding", with the expectation that the January 1933 issue would be the last one. As it turned out, enough stories were in inventory, and enough paper was available, to publish one further issue, so the last Clayton "Astounding" was dated March 1933. In April, Clayton went bankrupt, and sold his magazine titles to T.R. Foley for $100; Foley resold them in August to <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a>, a well-established publisher.

Science fiction was not entirely a departure for Street & Smith. They already had two pulp titles that occasionally ventured into the field: "<a href="The%20Shadow">The Shadow</a>", which had begun in 1931 and was tremendously successful, with a circulation over 300,000; and "<a href="Doc%20Savage">Doc Savage</a>", which had been launched in March 1933. They gave the post of editor of "Astounding" to <a href="F.%20Orlin%20Tremaine">F. Orlin Tremaine</a>, an experienced editor who had been working for Clayton as the editor of "<a href="Clues%20%28magazine%29">Clues</a>", and who had come to Street & Smith as part of the transfer of titles after Clayton's bankruptcy. Desmond Hall, who had also come from Clayton, was made assistant editor; because Tremaine was editor of "Clue" and "<a href="Top-Notch%20Magazine">Top-Notch</a>", as well as "Astounding", Hall did much of the editorial work, though Tremaine retained final control over the contents.

The first Street & Smith issue was dated October 1933; until the third issue, in December 1933, the editorial team was not named on the masthead. Street & Smith had an excellent distribution network, and they were able to get "Astounding"'s circulation up to an estimated 50,000 by the middle of 1934. The two main rival science-fiction magazines of the day, "Wonder Stories" and "Amazing Stories", each had a circulation about half that. "Astounding" was the leading science-fiction magazine by the end of 1934, and it was also the largest, at 160 pages, and the cheapest, at 20 cents. Street & Smith's rates of one cent per word (sometimes more) on acceptance were not as high as the rates paid by Bates for the Clayton "Astounding", but they were still better than those of the other magazines.

Hall left "Astounding" in 1934 to become editor of Street & Smith's new <a href="slick%20%28magazine%20format%29">slick</a> magazine, "<a href="Mademoiselle%20%28magazine%29">Mademoiselle</a>", and was replaced by R.V. Happel. Tremaine remained in control of story selection. Writer <a href="Frank%20Gruber%20%28writer%29">Frank Gruber</a> described Tremaine's editorial selection process in his book, "The Pulp Jungle":

Gruber pointed out that stories in the middle might go many months before Tremaine read them; the result was erratic response times that sometimes stretched to over 18 months.

In 1936 the magazine switched from untrimmed to trimmed edges; Brian Stableford comments that this was "an important symbolic" step, as the other sf pulps were still untrimmed, making "Astounding" smarter-looking than its competitors. Tremaine was promoted to assistant editorial director in 1937. His replacement as editor of "Astounding" was <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell%2C%20Jr.">John W. Campbell, Jr.</a>. Campbell had made his name in the early 1930s as a writer, publishing <a href="space%20opera">space opera</a> under his own name, and more thoughtful stories under the pseudonym "Don A. Stuart". He started working for Street & Smith in October 1937, so his initial editorial influence appeared in the issue dated December 1937. The March 1938 issue was the first that was fully his responsibility. In early 1938, Street & Smith abandoned its policy of having editors-in-chief, with the result that Tremaine was made redundant. His departure, on May 1, 1938, gave Campbell a freer rein with the magazine.

One of Campbell's first acts was to change the title from "Astounding Stories" to "Astounding Science-Fiction", starting with the March 1938 issue. Campbell's editorial policy was targeted at the more mature readers of science fiction, and he felt that ""Astounding Stories"" did not convey the right image. He intended to subsequently drop the "Astounding" part of the title, as well, leaving the magazine titled "Science Fiction", but in 1939 a new magazine with that title appeared. Although "Astounding" was retained in the title, thereafter it was often printed in a color that made it much less visible than "Science-Fiction". At the start of 1942 the price was increased, for the first time, to 25 cents; the magazine simultaneously switched to the larger <a href="bedsheet">bedsheet</a> format, but this did not last. "Astounding" returned to pulp-size in mid-1943 for six issues, and then became the first science fiction magazine to switch to <a href="digest%20size">digest size</a> in November 1943, increasing the number of pages to maintain the same total wordcount. The price remained at 25 cents through these changes in format.

The price increased again, to 35 cents, in August 1951. In the late 1950s, it became apparent to Street & Smith that they were going to have to raise prices again. During 1959, "Astounding" was priced at 50 cents in some areas to find out what the impact would be on circulation. The results were apparently satisfactory, and the price was raised with the November 1959 issue. The following year, Campbell finally achieved his goal of getting rid of the word "Astounding" in the magazine's title, changing it to "Analog Science Fact/Science Fiction". The "/" in the title was often replaced by a symbol of Campbell's devising, resembling an inverted U pierced by a horizontal arrow and meaning "analogous to". The change began with the February 1960 issue, and was complete by October; for several issues both "Analog" and "Astounding" could be seen on the cover, with "Analog" becoming bolder and "Astounding" fading with each issue.

Street & Smith was acquired by <a href="Samuel%20Irving%20Newhouse%20Jr.">Samuel Newhouse</a>, the owner of Condé Nast, in August 1959, though Street & Smith was not merged into Condé Nast until the end of 1961. "Analog" was the only digest-sized magazine in Condé Nast's inventory—all the others were slicks, such as "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>" and "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>". All the advertisers in these magazines had plates made up to take advantage of this size, and Condé Nast changed "Analog" to the larger size from the March 1963 issue to conform. The front and back <a href="signature%20mark">signature</a>s were changed to glossy paper, to carry both advertisements and scientific features. The change did not attract advertising support, however, and from the April 1965 issue "Analog" reverted to digest size once again. Circulation, which had been increasing before the change, was not harmed, and continued to increase while "Analog" was in slick format. From the April 1965 issue the title switched the "fiction" and "fact" elements, so that it became "Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact".

Campbell died suddenly in July 1971, but there was enough material in "Analog"s inventory to allow the remaining staff to put together issues for the rest of the year. Condé Nast had given the magazine very little attention, since it was both profitable and cheap to produce, but they were proud that it was the leading science-fiction magazine. They asked <a href="Kay%20Tarrant">Kay Tarrant</a>, who had been Campbell's assistant, to help them find a replacement: she contacted regular contributors to ask for suggestions. Several well-known writers turned down the job; <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a> did not want to leave California, and neither did <a href="Jerry%20Pournelle">Jerry Pournelle</a>, who also felt the salary was too small. Before he died, Campbell had talked to <a href="Harry%20Harrison%20%28writer%29">Harry Harrison</a> about taking over as editor, but Harrison did not want to live in New York. <a href="Lester%20del%20Rey">Lester del Rey</a> and <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford D. Simak</a> were also rumored to have been offered the job, though Simak denied it; <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a> was interested, but suspected his desire to change the direction of the magazine lessened his chances with Condé Nast. The Condé Nast vice president in charge of selecting the new editor decided to read both fiction and nonfiction writing samples from the applicants, since "Analog"s title included both "science fiction" and "science fact". He chose <a href="Ben%20Bova">Ben Bova</a>, afterwards telling Bova that his stories and articles "were the only ones I could understand". January 1972 was the first issue to credit Bova on the masthead.

Bova planned to stay for five years, to ensure a smooth transition after Campbell's sudden death; the salary was too low for him to consider remaining indefinitely. In 1975, he proposed a new magazine to Condé Nast management, to be titled "Tomorrow Magazine"; he wanted to publish articles about science and technology, leavened with some science-fiction stories. Condé Nast was not interested, and refused to assist "Analog" with marketing or promotions. Bova resigned in June 1978, having stayed for a little longer than he had planned, and recommended <a href="Stanley%20Schmidt">Stanley Schmidt</a> to succeed him. Schmidt's first issue was December 1978, though material purchased by Bova continued to appear for several months.

In 1977, <a href="Davis%20Publications">Davis Publications</a> launched "<a href="Isaac%20Asimov%27s%20Science%20Fiction%20Magazine">Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine</a>", and after Bova's departure, Joel Davis, the owner of Davis Publications, contacted Condé Nast with a view to acquiring "Analog. Analog" had always been something of a misfit in Condé Nast's line up, which included "Mademoiselle" and "Vogue", and by February 1980 the deal was agreed. The first issue published by Davis was dated September 1980. Davis was willing to put some effort into marketing "Analog", so Schmidt regarded the change as likely to be beneficial, and in fact circulation quickly grew, reversing a gradual decline over the Bova years, from just over 92,000 in 1981 to almost 110,000 two years later. Starting with the first 1981 issue, Davis switched "Analog" to a four-weekly schedule, rather than monthly, to align the production schedule with a weekly calendar. Instead of being dated "January 1981", the first issue under the new regime was dated "January 5, 1981", but this approach led to newsstands removing the magazine much more quickly, since the date gave the impression that it was a weekly magazine. The cover date was changed back to the current month starting with the April 1982 issue, but the new schedule remained in place, with a "Mid-September" issue in 1982 and 1983, and "Mid-December" issues for more than a decade thereafter. Circulation trended slowly down over the 1980s, to 83,000 for the year ending in 1990; by this time the great majority of readers were subscribers, as newsstand sales declined to only 15,000.
In 1992 "Analog" was sold to <a href="Dell%20Magazines">Dell Magazines</a>, and Dell was in turn acquired by Crosstown Publications in 1996. That year the Mid-December issues stopped appearing, and the following year the July and August issues were combined into a single bimonthly issue. An ebook edition became available in 2000 and has become increasingly popular, with the ebook numbers not reflected in the published annual circulation numbers, which by 2011 were down to under 27,000. In 2004 the January and February issues were combined, so that only ten issues a year appeared. Schmidt retired in August 2012, and his place was taken by <a href="Trevor%20Quachri">Trevor Quachri</a>, who continues to edit "Analog" as of 2018. From January 2017, the publication frequency became bimonthly (six issues per year).

The first incarnation of "Astounding" was an adventure-oriented magazine: unlike Gernsback, Bates had no interest in educating his readership through science. The covers were all painted by <a href="Hans%20Waldemar%20Wessolowski">Wesso</a> and similarly action-filled; the first issue showed a giant beetle attacking a man. Bates would not accept any experimental stories, relying mostly on formulaic plots. In the eyes of <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, a science-fiction historian, Bates was "destroying the ideals of science fiction". One historically important story that almost appeared in "Astounding" was <a href="E.E.%20Smith">E.E. Smith</a>'s "<a href="Triplanetary%20%28novel%29">Triplanetary</a>", which Bates would have published had "Astounding" not folded in early 1933. The cover Wesso had painted for the story appeared on the March 1933 issue, the last to be published by Clayton.

When Street & Smith acquired "Astounding", they also planned to relaunch another Clayton pulp, "<a href="Strange%20Tales%20%28pulp%20magazine%29">Strange Tales</a>", and acquired material for it before deciding not to proceed. These stories appeared in the first Street & Smith "Astounding", dated October 1933. This issue and the next were unremarkable in quality, but with the December issue, Tremaine published a statement of editorial policy, calling for "thought variant" stories containing original ideas and not simply reproducing adventure themes in a science-fiction context. The policy was probably worked out between Tremaine and Desmond Hall, his assistant editor, in an attempt to give "Astounding" a clear identity in the market that would distinguish it from both the existing science-fiction magazines and the hero pulps, such as "The Shadow", that frequently used sf ideas.

The "thought variant" policy may have been introduced for publicity, rather than as a real attempt to define the sort of fiction Tremaine was looking for; the early "thought variant" stories were not always very original or well executed. Ashley describes the first, <a href="Nat%20Schachner">Nat Schachner</a>'s "Ancestral Voices", as "not amongst Schachner's best"; the second, "Colossus", by <a href="Donald%20Wandrei">Donald Wandrei</a>, was not a new idea, but was energetically written. Over the succeeding issues, it became apparent that Tremaine was genuinely willing to publish material that would have fallen foul of editorial taboos elsewhere. He serialized <a href="Charles%20Fort">Charles Fort</a>'s "<a href="Lo%21">Lo!</a>", a nonfiction work about strange and inexplicable phenomena, in eight parts between April and November 1934, in an attempt to stimulate new ideas for stories. The best-remembered story of 1934 is probably Jack Williamson's "The Legion of Space", which began serialization in April, but other notable stories include Murray Leinster's "Sidewise in Time", which was the first genre science-fiction story to use the idea of <a href="alternate%20history">alternate history</a>; "The Bright Illusion", by <a href="C.%20L.%20Moore">C.L. Moore</a>, and "<a href="Twilight%20%28short%20story%29">Twilight</a>", by John W. Campbell, writing as Don A. Stuart. "Twilight", which was written in a more literary and poetic style than Campbell's earlier space opera stories, was particularly influential, and Tremaine encouraged other writers to produce similar stories. One such was <a href="Raymond%20Z.%20Gallun">Raymond Z. Gallun</a>'s "Old Faithful", which appeared in the December 1934 issue and was sufficiently popular that Gallun wrote a sequel, "Son of Old Faithful", published the following July. Space opera continued to be popular, though, and two overlapping space opera novels were running in "Astounding" late in the year: "<a href="Skylark%20of%20Valeron">The Skylark of Valeron</a>" by E.E. Smith, and "<a href="The%20Mightiest%20Machine">The Mightiest Machine</a>", by Campbell. By the end of the year, "Astounding" was the clear leader of the small field of sf magazines.

"Astounding"s readership was more knowledgeable and more mature than the readers of the other magazines, and this was reflected in the cover artwork, almost entirely by <a href="Howard%20V.%20Brown">Howard V. Brown</a>, which was less garish than at "Wonder Stories" or "Amazing Stories". Ashley describes the interior artwork as "entrancing, giving hints of higher technology without ignoring the human element", and singles out the work of <a href="Elliot%20Dold">Elliot Dold</a> as particularly impressive.

Tremaine's policy of printing material that he liked without staying too strictly within the bounds of the genre led him to serialize <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H.P. Lovecraft</a>'s novel "<a href="At%20the%20Mountains%20of%20Madness">At the Mountains of Madness</a>" in early 1936. He followed this with Lovecraft's "<a href="The%20Shadow%20Out%20of%20Time">The Shadow Out of Time</a>" in June 1936, though protests from science-fiction purists occurred. Generally, however, Tremaine was unable to maintain the high standard he had set in the first few years, perhaps because his workload was high. Tremaine's slow responses to submissions discouraged new authors, although he could rely on regular contributors such as Jack Williamson, Murray Leinster, Raymond Gallun, Nat Schachner, and <a href="Frank%20Belknap%20Long">Frank Belknap Long</a>. New writers who did appear during the latter half of Tremaine's tenure included <a href="Ross%20Rocklynne">Ross Rocklynne</a>, <a href="Nelson%20S.%20Bond">Nelson S. Bond</a>, and <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>, whose first appearance was in September 1937 with "<a href="The%20Isolinguals">The Isolinguals</a>". Tremaine printed some nonfiction articles during his tenure, with Campbell providing an 18-part series on the solar system between June 1936 and December 1937.

Street & Smith hired Campbell in October 1937. Although he did not gain full editorial control of "Astounding" until the March 1938 issue, Campbell was able to introduce some new features before then. In January 1938, he began to include a short description of stories in the next issue, titled "In Times To Come"; and in March, he began "The Analytical Laboratory", which compiled votes from readers and ranked the stories in order. The payment rate at the time was one cent a word, and Street & Smith agreed to let Campbell pay a bonus of an extra quarter cent a word to the writer whose story was voted top of the list. Unlike other editors Campbell paid authors when he accepted—not published—their work; publication usually occurred several months after acceptance.

Campbell wanted his writers to provide action and excitement, but he also wanted the stories to appeal to a readership that had matured over the first decade of the science-fiction genre. He asked his writers to write stories that felt as though they could have been published as nonscience-fiction stories in a magazine of the future; a reader of the future would not need long explanations for the gadgets in their lives, so Campbell asked his writers to find ways of naturally introducing technology to their stories. He also instituted regular nonfiction pieces, with the goal of stimulating story ideas. The main contributors of these were <a href="Robert%20S.%20Richardson">R.S. Richardson</a>, L. Sprague de Camp, and <a href="Willy%20Ley">Willy Ley</a>.

Campbell changed the approach to the magazine's cover art, hoping that more mature artwork would attract more adult readers and enable them to carry the magazine without embarrassment. Howard V. Brown had done almost every cover for the Street & Smith version of "Astounding", and Campbell asked him to do an astronomically accurate picture of the Sun as seen from Mercury for the February 1938 issue. He also introduced <a href="Charles%20Schneeman">Charles Schneeman</a> as a cover artist, starting with the May 1938 issue, and <a href="Hubert%20Rogers">Hubert Rogers</a> in February 1939; Rogers quickly became a regular, painting all but four of the covers between September 1939 and August 1942. They differentiated the magazine from rivals. <a href="Algis%20Budrys">Algis Budrys</a> recalled that ""Astounding" was the last magazine I picked up" as a child because, without covers showing men with ray guns and women with large breasts, "it didn't look like an SF magazine".

The period beginning with Campbell's editorship of "Astounding" is usually referred to as the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Science%20Fiction">Golden Age of Science Fiction</a>, because of the immense influence he had on the genre. Within two years of becoming editor, he had published stories by many of the writers who would become central figures in science fiction. The list of names included established authors like <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, <a href="Clifford%20Simak">Clifford Simak</a>, <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>, <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>, <a href="Henry%20Kuttner">Henry Kuttner</a>, and <a href="C.L.%20Moore">C.L. Moore</a>, who became regulars in either "Astounding" or its sister magazine, "<a href="Unknown%20%28magazine%29">Unknown</a>", and new writers who published some of their first stories in "Astounding", such as <a href="Lester%20del%20Rey">Lester del Rey</a>, <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>, <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="A.%20E.%20van%20Vogt">A.E. van Vogt</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a>.

The April 1938 issue included the first story by del Rey, "The Faithful", and de Camp's second sale, "<a href="Hyperpilosity">Hyperpilosity</a>". Jack Williamson's "<a href="Legion%20of%20Time">Legion of Time</a>", described by author and editor <a href="Lin%20Carter">Lin Carter</a> as "possibly the greatest single adventure story in science fiction history", began serialization in the following issue. De Camp contributed a nonfiction article, "Language for Time Travelers", in the July issue, which also contained Hubbard's first science-fiction sale, "The Dangerous Dimension". Hubbard had been selling <a href="genre%20fiction">genre fiction</a> to the pulps for several years by that time. The same issue contained Clifford Simak's "Rule 18"; Simak had more-or-less abandoned science fiction within a year after breaking into the field in 1931, but he was drawn back by Campbell's editorial approach. The next issue featured one of Campbell's best-known stories, "<a href="Who%20Goes%20There%3F">Who Goes There?</a>", and included Kuttner's "The Disinherited"; Kuttner had been selling successfully to the other pulps for a few years, but this was his first story in "Astounding". In October, de Camp began a popular series about an intelligent bear named Johnny Black with "<a href="The%20Command%20%28short%20story%29">The Command</a>."

The market for science fiction expanded dramatically the following year; several new magazines were launched, including "<a href="Startling%20Stories">Startling Stories</a>" in January 1939, "Unknown" in March (a fantasy companion to "Astounding", also edited by Campbell), "<a href="Fantastic%20Adventures">Fantastic Adventures</a>" in May, and "<a href="Planet%20Stories">Planet Stories</a>" in December. All of the competing magazines, including the two main extant titles, "Wonder Stories" and "Amazing Stories", were publishing space opera, stories of interplanetary adventure, or other well-worn ideas from the early days of the genre. Campbell's attempts to make science fiction more mature led to a natural division of the writers: those who were unable to write to his standards continued to sell to other magazines; and those who could sell to Campbell quickly focused their attention on "Astounding" and sold relatively little to the other magazines. The expansion of the market also benefited Campbell because writers knew that if he rejected their submissions, they could resubmit those stories elsewhere; this freed them to try to write to his standards.

In July 1939, the lead story was "<a href="Black%20Destroyer">Black Destroyer</a>", the first sale by van Vogt; the issue also included "<a href="Trends%20%28short%20story%29">Trends</a>", Asimov's first sale to Campbell and his second story to see print. Later fans identified the issue as the start of the Golden Age. Other first sales that year included Heinlein's "Lifeline" in August and Sturgeon's "Ether Breather" the following month. One of the most popular authors of space opera, E.E. Smith, reappeared in October, with the first installment of "<a href="Gray%20Lensman">Gray Lensman</a>". This was a sequel to "<a href="Galactic%20Patrol">Galactic Patrol</a>", which had appeared in "Astounding" two years before.

Heinlein rapidly became one of the most prolific contributors to "Astounding", publishing three novels in the next two years: "<a href="If%20This%20Goes%20On%E2%80%94">If This Goes On—</a>", "<a href="Sixth%20Column">Sixth Column</a>", and "<a href="Methuselah%27s%20Children">Methuselah's Children</a>"; and half a dozen short stories. In September 1940, van Vogt's first novel, "<a href="Slan">Slan</a>", began serialization; the book was partly inspired by a challenge Campbell laid down to van Vogt that it was impossible to tell a superman story from the point of view of the superman. It proved to be one of the most popular stories Campbell published, and is an example of the way Campbell worked with his writers to feed them ideas and generate the material he wanted to buy. Isaac Asimov's <a href="Robot%20series%20%28Asimov%29">"Robot" series</a> began to take shape in 1941, with "Reason" and "Liar!" appearing in the April and May issues; as with "Slan", these stories were partly inspired by conversations with Campbell. The September 1941 issue included Asimov's short story "<a href="Nightfall%20%28Asimov%20novelette%20and%20novel%29">Nightfall</a>", probably the most famous U.S. science-fiction story ever written, and in November, "<a href="Second%20Stage%20Lensmen">Second Stage Lensman</a>", the next novel in Smith's "Lensman" series, began serialization.

The following year brought the first installment of Asimov's "<a href="Foundation%20series">Foundation</a>" stories; "Foundation" appeared in May and "Bridle and Saddle" in June. Van Vogt's "Recruiting Station", in the March issue, was the first story in his "Weapon Shop" series, described by critic <a href="John%20Clute">John Clute</a> as the most compelling of all van Vogt's work. Henry Kuttner and C.L. Moore began to appear regularly in "Astounding", often under the pseudonym "Lewis Padgett", and more new writers appeared: <a href="Hal%20Clement">Hal Clement</a>, <a href="Raymond%20F.%20Jones">Raymond F. Jones</a>, and <a href="George%20O.%20Smith">George O. Smith</a>, all of whom became regular contributors. The September 1942 issue contained del Rey's "Nerves", which was one of the few stories to be ranked top by every single reader who voted in the monthly Analytical Laboratory poll; it dealt with the aftermath of an explosion at a nuclear plant.

Campbell emphasized scientific accuracy over literary style. Asimov, Heinlein, and de Camp were trained scientists and engineers. After 1942, several of the regular contributors such as Heinlein, Asimov, and Hubbard, who had joined the war effort, appeared less frequently. Among those who remained, the key figures were van Vogt, Simak, Kuttner, Moore, and <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>, all of whom were less oriented towards technology in their fiction than writers like Asimov or Heinlein. This led to the appearance of more psychologically oriented fiction, such as van Vogt's "<a href="The%20World%20of%20Null-A">World of Null-A</a>", which was serialized in 1945. Kuttner and Moore contributed a humorous series about an inventor, Galloway Gallegher, who could only invent while drunk, but they were also capable of serious fiction. Campbell had asked them to write science fiction with the same freedom from constraints that he had allowed them in the fantasy works they were writing for "Unknown", Street & Smith's fantasy title; the result was "<a href="Mimsy%20Were%20the%20Borogoves">Mimsy Were the Borogoves</a>", which appeared in February 1943 and is now regarded as a classic. Leiber's "Gather, Darkness!", serialized in 1943, was set in a world where scientific knowledge is hidden from the masses and presented as magic; as with Kuttner and Moore, he was simultaneously publishing fantasies in "Unknown".

Campbell continued to publish technological sf alongside the <a href="soft%20science%20fiction">soft science fiction</a>. One example was <a href="Cleve%20Cartmill">Cleve Cartmill</a>'s "<a href="Deadline%20%28science%20fiction%20story%29">Deadline</a>", a story about the development of the atomic bomb. It appeared in 1944, when the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> was still not known to the public; Cartmill used his background in atomic physics to assemble a plausible story that had strong similarities to the real-world secret research program. Military Intelligence agents called on Campbell to investigate, and were satisfied when he explained how Cartmill had been able to make so many accurate guesses. In the words of science fiction critic John Clute, "Cartmill's prediction made sf fans enormously proud", as some considered the story proof that science fiction could be predictive of the future.

In the late 1940s, both "Thrilling Wonder" and "Startling Stories" began to publish much more mature fiction than they had during the war, and although "Astounding" was still the leading magazine in the field, it was no longer the only market for the writers who had been regularly selling to Campbell. Many of the best new writers still broke into print in "Astounding" rather than elsewhere. <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s first story, "<a href="Loophole%20%28short%20story%29">Loophole</a>", appeared in the April 1946 "Astounding", and another British writer, <a href="John%20Christopher">Christopher Youd</a>, began his career with "Christmas Tree" in February 1949. Youd would become much better known under his pseudonym "John Christopher". <a href="William%20Tenn">William Tenn</a>'s first sale, "Alexander the Bait", appeared in May 1946, and H. Beam Piper's "Time and Time Again" in the April 1947 issue was his first story. Along with these newer writers, Campbell was still publishing strong material by authors who had become established during the war. Among the better-known stories of this era are "<a href="Vintage%20Season">Vintage Season</a>", by C.L. Moore (under the pseudonym Lawrence O'Donnell); Jack Williamson's story "<a href="With%20Folded%20Hands">With Folded Hands</a>"; "<a href="The%20Pawns%20of%20Null-A">The Players of Null-A</a>", van Vogt's sequel to "The World of Null-A"; and the final book in E.E. Smith's "Lensman" series, "<a href="Children%20of%20the%20Lens%20%28novel%29">Children of the Lens</a>".

In the November 1948 issue, Campbell published a letter to the editor by a reader named Richard A. Hoen that contained a detailed ranking of the contents of an issue "one year in the future". Campbell went along with the joke and contracted stories from most of the authors mentioned in the letter that would follow the Hoen's imaginary story titles. One of the best-known stories from that issue is <a href="Gulf%20%28Heinlein%29">"Gulf"</a>, by Heinlein. Other stories and articles were written by some of the most famous authors of the time: Asimov, Sturgeon, del Rey, van Vogt, de Camp, and the astronomer <a href="R.%20S.%20Richardson">R. S. Richardson</a>.

By 1950, Campbell's strong personality had led him into conflict with some of his leading writers, some of whom abandoned "Astounding" as a result. The launch of both "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>" and "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>" in 1949 and 1950, respectively, marked the end of "Astounding"s dominance of science fiction, with many now regarding "Galaxy" as the leading magazine. Campbell's growing interest in <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> also damaged his reputation in the field. Campbell was deeply involved with the launch of <a href="Dianetics">Dianetics</a>, publishing Hubbard's first article on it in "Astounding" in May 1950, and promoting it heavily in the months beforehand; later in the decade he championed <a href="psionics">psionics</a> and antigravity devices.

Although these enthusiasms diminished Campbell's reputation, "Astounding" continued to publish some popular and influential science fiction. In 1953, Campbell serialized Hal Clement's "<a href="Mission%20of%20Gravity">Mission of Gravity</a>", described by <a href="John%20Clute">John Clute</a> and <a href="David%20Langford">David Langford</a> as "one of the best-loved novels in sf", and in 1954 <a href="Tom%20Godwin">Tom Godwin</a>'s "<a href="The%20Cold%20Equations">The Cold Equations</a>" appeared. The story, about a girl who stows away on a spaceship, generated much reader debate, and has been described as capturing the ethos of Campbell's "Astounding". The spaceship is carrying urgently needed medical supplies to a planet in distress, and has a single pilot; the ship does not have enough fuel to reach the planet if the girl stays on the ship, so the "cold equations" of physics force the pilot to jettison the girl, killing her.

Later in the 1950s and early 1960s writers like <a href="Gordon%20R.%20Dickson">Gordon R. Dickson</a>, Poul Anderson, and Harry Harrison appeared regularly in the magazine. <a href="Frank%20Herbert">Frank Herbert</a>'s "<a href="Dune%20%28novel%29">Dune</a>" was serialized in "Analog" in two separate sequences, in 1963 and 1965, and soon became "one of the most famous of all sf novels", according to <a href="Malcolm%20Edwards">Malcolm Edwards</a> and John Clute. 1965 marked the year Campbell received his eighth <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Professional%20Magazine">Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine</a>; this was the last one he would win.

Bova, like Campbell, was a technophile with a scientific background, and he declared early in his tenure that he wanted "Analog" to continue to focus on stories with a scientific foundation, though he also made it clear that change was inevitable. Over his first few months some long-time readers sent in letters of complaint when they judged that Bova was not living up to Campbell's standards, particularly when sex scenes began to appear. On one occasion—<a href="Jack%20Wodhams">Jack Wodhams</a>' story "Foundling Fathers", and its accompanying illustration by <a href="Frank%20Kelly%20Freas">Kelly Freas</a>—it turned out that Campbell had bought the story in question. As the 1970s went on, Bova continued to publish authors such as Anderson, Dickson, and <a href="Christopher%20Anvil">Christopher Anvil</a>, who had appeared regularly during Campbell's tenure, but he also attracted authors who had not been able to sell to Campbell, such as <a href="Gene%20Wolfe">Gene Wolfe</a>, <a href="Roger%20Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>, and <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a>. Frederik Pohl, who later commented in his autobiography about his difficulties in selling to Campbell, appeared in the March 1972 issue with "<a href="The%20Gold%20at%20the%20Starbow%27s%20End">The Gold at the Starbow's End</a>", which was nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and that summer <a href="Joe%20Haldeman">Joe Haldeman</a>'s "Hero" appeared. This was the first story in Haldeman's "<a href="The%20Forever%20War%20series">Forever War</a>" sequence; Campbell had rejected it, listing multiple reasons including the frequent use of profanity and the implausibility of men and women serving in combat together. Bova asked to see it again and ran it without asking for changes. Other new writers included <a href="Spider%20Robinson">Spider Robinson</a>, whose first sale was "The Guy With the Eyes" in the February 1973 issue; <a href="George%20R.%20R.%20Martin">George R.R. Martin</a>, with "A Song for Lya", in June 1974; and <a href="Orson%20Scott%20Card">Orson Scott Card</a>, with "<a href="Ender%27s%20Game%20%28short%20story%29">Ender's Game</a>", in the August 1977 issue.

Two of the cover artists who had been regular contributors under Campbell, Kelly Freas and <a href="John%20Schoenherr">John Schoenherr</a>, continued to appear after Bova took over, and Bova also began to regularly feature covers by <a href="Rick%20Sternbach">Rick Sternbach</a> and <a href="Vincent%20Di%20Fate">Vincent di Fate</a>. <a href="Jack%20Gaughan">Jack Gaughan</a>, who had had a poor relationship with Campbell, sold several covers to Bova. Bova won the <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Professional%20Editor">Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor</a> for five consecutive years, 1973 through 1977.

Stanley Schmidt was an assistant professor of physics when he became editor of "Analog", and his scientific background was well-suited to the magazine's readership. He avoided making drastic changes, and continued the long-standing tradition of writing provocative editorials, though he rarely discussed science fiction. In 1979 he resurrected "Probability Zero", a feature that Campbell had run in the early 1940s that published tall tales—humorous stories with ludicrous or impossible scientific premises. Also in 1979 Schmidt began a series of columns titled "The Alternate View", an opinion column that was written in alternate issues by <a href="G.%20Harry%20Stine">G. Harry Stine</a> and Jerry Pournelle, and which is still a feature of the magazine as of 2016, though now with different contributors. The stable of fiction contributors remained largely unchanged from Bova's day, and included many names, such as Poul Anderson, Gordon R. Dickson, and George O. Smith, familiar to readers from the Campbell era. This continuity led to criticisms within the field, <a href="Bruce%20Sterling">Bruce Sterling</a> writing in 1984 that the magazine "has become old, dull, and drivelling... It is a situation screaming for reform. "Analog" no longer permits itself to be read." The magazine thrived nevertheless, and though part of the increase in circulation during the early 1980s may have been due to Davis Publications' energetic efforts to increase subscriptions, Schmidt knew what his readership wanted and made sure they got it, commenting in 1985: "I reserve "Analog" for the kind of science fiction I've described here: good stories about people with problems in which some piece of plausible (or at least not demonstrably implausible) speculative science plays an indispensable role".

Over the decades of Schmidt's editorship, many writers became regular contributors, including <a href="Catherine%20Asaro">Catherine Asaro</a>, <a href="Maya%20Kaathryn%20Bohnhoff">Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff</a>, <a href="Michael%20Flynn%20%28author%29">Michael Flynn</a>, <a href="Geoffrey%20A.%20Landis">Geoffrey A. Landis</a>, <a href="Paul%20Levinson">Paul Levinson</a>, <a href="Robert%20J.%20Sawyer">Robert J. Sawyer</a>, <a href="Charles%20Sheffield">Charles Sheffield</a> and <a href="Harry%20Turtledove">Harry Turtledove</a>. Schmidt never won an editing Hugo while in charge of the magazine, but after he resigned he won the 2013 <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Professional%20Editor%23Short%20Form">Hugo for Editor Short Form</a>.

Schmidt retired in August 2012, and his place was taken by <a href="Trevor%20Quachri">Trevor Quachri</a>, who mostly continued the editorial policies of Schmidt. Starting in January 2017, the publication became bimonthly.

As of September 2016, the editorial succession at "Astounding" and "Analog" is as follows:
"Astounding" was published in pulp format until the January 1942 issue, when it switched to bedsheet. It reverted to pulp for six issues, starting in May 1943, and then became the first of the genre sf magazines to be published in digest format, beginning with the November 1943 issue. The format remained unchanged until Condé Nast produced 25 bedsheet issues of "Analog" between March 1963 and March 1965, after which it returned to digest format. In May 1998, and again in December 2008, the format was changed to be slightly larger than the usual digest size: first to 8.25 x 5.25 in (210 x 135 mm), and then to 8.5 x 5.75 in (217 x 148 mm). The magazine was originally titled "Astounding Stories of Super-Science"; this was shortened to "Astounding Stories" from February 1931 to November 1932, and the longer title returned for the three Clayton issues at the start of 1933. The Street & Smith issues began as "Astounding Stories", and changed to "Astounding Science-Fiction" in March 1938. The hyphen disappeared in November 1946, and the title then remained unchanged until 1960, when the title "Analog Science Fact & Fiction" was phased in between February and October (i.e., the words "Astounding" and "Analog" both appeared on the cover, with "Analog" gradually increasing in prominence over the months, culminating in the name "Astounding" being completely dropped.) In April 1965 the subtitle was reversed, so that the magazine became "Analog Science Fiction & Fact", and it has remained unchanged since then, though it has undergone several stylistic and orthographic variations.

As of 2016, the sequence of prices over the magazine's history is as follows:

A British edition published by Atlas Publishing and Distributing Company ran from August 1939 until August 1963, initially in pulp format, switching to digest from November 1953. The pulp issues began at 96 pages, then dropped to 80 pages with the March 1940 issue, and to 64 pages in December that year. All the digest issues were 128 pages long. The price was 9<a href="%C2%A3sd">d</a> until October 1953; thereafter it was 1/6 until February 1961, and 2/6 until the end of the run. The material in the British editions was selected from the U.S. issues, most stories coming from a single U.S. number, and other stories picked from earlier or later issues to fill the magazine. The covers were usually repainted from the American originals.

An Italian magazine, "", published seven issues from April 1952 to March 1953, the contents drawn mostly from "Astounding", along with some original stories. The editor was , and the publisher was Editrice Krator. Danish publisher Skrifola produced six issues of "Planetmagazinet" in 1958; it carried reprints, mostly from "Astounding", and was edited by Knud Erik Andersen.

A German anthology series of recent 1980s stories from "Analog" was published in eight volumes by from October 1981 up to June 1984.

Anthologies of stories from "Astounding" or "Analog" include:

Satyajit Ray

Satyajit Ray (; 2 May 1921 – 23 April 1992) was an Indian filmmaker, screenwriter, music composer, graphic artist, lyricist and author, widely regarded as one of the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century. Ray was born in <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> into a <a href="Bengali%20Kayastha">Bengali Kayastha</a> family which was prominent in the field of arts and literature. Starting his career as a commercial artist, Ray was drawn into <a href="independent%20film">independent film</a>making after meeting French filmmaker <a href="Jean%20Renoir">Jean Renoir</a> and viewing <a href="Vittorio%20De%20Sica">Vittorio De Sica</a>'s <a href="Italian%20neorealism">Italian neorealist</a> film "<a href="Bicycle%20Thieves">Bicycle Thieves</a>" (1948) during a visit to London.

Ray directed 36 films, including feature films, documentaries and <a href="short%20subject">shorts</a>. He was also a fiction writer, publisher, illustrator, calligrapher, music composer, graphic designer and film critic. He authored several short stories and novels, meant primarily for young children and teenagers. <a href="Feluda">Feluda</a>, the sleuth, and <a href="Professor%20Shonku">Professor Shonku</a>, the scientist in his science fiction stories, are popular fictional characters created by him. He was awarded an honorary degree by <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a>.

Ray's first film, "<a href="Pather%20Panchali">Pather Panchali</a>" (1955), won eleven international prizes, including the inaugural Best Human Document award at the <a href="1956%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">1956 Cannes Film Festival</a>. This film, along with "<a href="Aparajito">Aparajito</a>" (1956) and "<a href="The%20World%20of%20Apu">Apur Sansar</a>" ("The World of Apu") (1959), form "<a href="The%20Apu%20Trilogy">The Apu Trilogy</a>". Ray did the <a href="screenplay">scripting</a>, casting, <a href="Film%20score">scoring</a>, and editing, and designed his own credit titles and publicity material. Ray received many <a href="List%20of%20awards%20conferred%20on%20Satyajit%20Ray">major awards</a> in his career, including 32 Indian <a href="National%20Film%20Awards">National Film Awards</a>, a <a href="Golden%20Lion">Golden Lion</a>, a <a href="Golden%20Bear">Golden Bear</a>, 2 <a href="Silver%20Bear%20for%20Best%20Director">Silver Bears</a>, a number of additional awards at international film festivals and award ceremonies, and an <a href="Academy%20Honorary%20Award">Academy Honorary Award</a> in 1992. The Government of India honored him with the <a href="Bharat%20Ratna">Bharat Ratna</a>, its highest civilian award, in 1992. Ray had received many noticible awards and gained a prestigious position over his life time. 

In 2004, Ray was ranked number 13 in BBC's poll of the <a href="Greatest%20Bengali%20of%20all%20time">Greatest Bengali of all time</a>.

Satyajit Ray's ancestry can be traced back for at least ten generations. Ray's grandfather, <a href="Upendrakishore%20Ray">Upendrakishore Ray</a> was a writer, illustrator, philosopher, publisher, <a href="amateur%20astronomer">amateur astronomer</a> and a leader of the <a href="Brahmo%20Samaj">Brahmo Samaj</a>, a religious and social movement in nineteenth century <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>. He also set up a printing press by the name of <a href="U.%20Ray%20and%20Sons">U. Ray and Sons</a>, which formed a crucial backdrop to Satyajit's life. <a href="Sukumar%20Ray">Sukumar Ray</a>, Upendrakishore's son and father of Satyajit, was a pioneering <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali</a> writer of <a href="nonsense%20verse">nonsense rhyme</a> (<a href="Abol%20tabol">Abol tabol</a>) and children's literature, an illustrator and a critic. Ray was born to Sukumar and Suprabha Ray in Calcutta.

Satyajit Ray's family had acquired the name 'Ray'(originally 'Rai') from the Mughals.
Although they were <a href="Bengali%20Kayastha">Bengali Kayastha</a>s, the Rays were 'Vaishnavas' (worshippers of Vishnu) as against majority <a href="Bengali%20Kayastha">Bengali Kayastha</a>s who were 'Shaktos' (worshippers of the Shakti) .

<a href="Sukumar%20Ray">Sukumar Ray</a> died when Satyajit was barely three, and the family survived on Suprabha Ray's meager income. Ray studied at <a href="Ballygunge%20Government%20High%20School">Ballygunge Government High School, Calcutta</a>, and completed his BA in economics at <a href="Presidency%20College%2C%20Calcutta">Presidency College, Calcutta</a> then affiliated with the <a href="University%20of%20Calcutta">University of Calcutta</a>,(now Kolkata)though his interest was always in fine arts. In 1940, his mother insisted that he studied at the <a href="Visva-Bharati%20University">Visva-Bharati University</a> at <a href="Santiniketan">Santiniketan</a>, founded by <a href="Rabindranath%20Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>. Ray was reluctant due to his love of Calcutta, and the low opinion of the intellectual life at Santiniketan. His mother's persuasion and his respect for Tagore finally convinced him to try. In Santiniketan, Ray came to appreciate <a href="Oriental%20art">Oriental art</a>. He later admitted that he learned much from the famous painters <a href="Nandalal%20Bose">Nandalal Bose</a> and <a href="Benode%20Behari%20Mukherjee">Benode Behari Mukherjee</a>. Later he produced a documentary film, "The Inner Eye," about Mukherjee. His visits to <a href="Ajanta%20Caves">Ajanta</a>, <a href="Ellora%20Caves">Ellora</a> and <a href="Elephanta%20Caves">Elephanta</a> stimulated his admiration for <a href="Indian%20art">Indian art</a>.
In 1943, Ray started work at D.J. Keymer, a British-run advertising agency, as a "junior visualiser," earning eighty <a href="rupees">rupees</a> a month. Although he liked <a href="visual%20design">visual design</a> (graphic design) and he was mostly treated well, there was tension between the British and Indian employees of the firm. The British were better paid, and Ray felt that "the clients were generally stupid." Later, Ray also worked for <a href="Signet%20Press">Signet Press</a>, a new publishing house started by D. K. Gupta. Gupta asked Ray to create cover designs for books to be published by Signet Press and gave him complete artistic freedom. Ray designed covers for many books, including <a href="Jibanananda%20Das">Jibanananda Das</a>'s "<a href="Banalata%20Sen%20%28book%29">Banalata Sen</a>", and "<a href="Rupasi%20Bangla">Rupasi Bangla</a>", <a href="Bibhutibhushan%20Bandyopadhyay">Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay</a>'s "<a href="Chander%20Pahar">Chander Pahar</a>", <a href="Jim%20Corbett">Jim Corbett</a>'s "<a href="Maneaters%20of%20Kumaon">Maneaters of Kumaon</a>," and <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>'s "<a href="Discovery%20of%20India">Discovery of India</a>." He worked on a children's version of "Pather Panchali," a classic Bengali novel by <a href="Bibhutibhushan%20Bandyopadhyay">Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay</a>, renamed as "Aam Antir Bhepu" ("The mango-seed whistle"). Designing the cover and illustrating the book, Ray was deeply influenced by the work. He used it as the subject of his first film, and featured his illustrations as shots in his ground-breaking film.

Along with <a href="Chidananda%20Dasgupta">Chidananda Dasgupta</a> and others, Ray founded the <a href="Calcutta%20Film%20Society">Calcutta Film Society</a> in 1947. They screened many foreign films, many of which Ray watched and seriously studied. He befriended the American <a href="G.I.%20%28military%29">GIs</a> stationed in Calcutta during World War II, who kept him informed about the latest American films showing in the city. He came to know a <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a> employee, Norman Clare, who shared Ray's passion for films, <a href="chess">chess</a> and western classical music.

In 1949, Ray married <a href="Bijoya%20Ray">Bijoya Das</a>, his first cousin and long-time sweetheart. The couple had a son, <a href="Sandip%20Ray">Sandip</a>, who is now a film director. In the same year, French director <a href="Jean%20Renoir">Jean Renoir</a> came to Calcutta to shoot his film "<a href="The%20River%20%281951%20film%29">The River</a>". Ray helped him to find locations in the countryside. Ray told Renoir about his idea of filming "Pather Panchali", which had long been on his mind, and Renoir encouraged him in the project. In 1950, D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to work at its headquarters office. During his three months in London, Ray watched 99 films. Among these was the <a href="Italian%20Neorealism">neorealist</a> film "Ladri di biciclette" ("<a href="Bicycle%20Thieves">Bicycle Thieves</a>") (1948) by <a href="Vittorio%20De%20Sica">Vittorio De Sica</a>, which had a profound impact on him. Ray later said that he came out of the theatre determined to become a film-maker.

Ray decided to use "<a href="Pather%20Panchali%20%28novel%29">Pather Panchali</a>" (1928), the classic "<a href="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</a>" of <a href="Bengali%20literature">Bengali literature</a>, as the basis for his first film. The semi-autobiographical novel describes the maturation of Apu, a small boy in a Bengal village.

Ray gathered an inexperienced crew, although both his cameraman <a href="Subrata%20Mitra">Subrata Mitra</a> and art director <a href="Bansi%20Chandragupta">Bansi Chandragupta</a> went on to achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur actors. He started shooting in late 1952 with his personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some passages shot, but did not succeed on his terms. As a result, Ray shot "Pather Panchali" over three years, an unusually long period, based on when he or his production manager <a href="Anil%20Chowdhury">Anil Chowdhury</a> could raise additional funds. He refused funding from sources who wanted a change in script or supervision over production. He also ignored advice from the government to incorporate a happy ending, but he did receive funding that allowed him to complete the film. Ray showed an early film passage to the American director <a href="John%20Huston">John Huston</a>, who was in India scouting locations for "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Would%20Be%20King%20%28film%29">The Man Who Would Be King</a>". The passage was of the vision which Apu and his sister have of the train running through the countryside, the only sequence which Ray had yet filmed due to his small budget. Huston notified <a href="Monroe%20Wheeler">Monroe Wheeler</a> at the <a href="New%20York%20Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">New York Museum of Modern Art</a> (MOMA) that a major talent was on the horizon.

With a loan from the <a href="Government%20of%20West%20Bengal">West Bengal government</a>, Ray finally completed the film. It was released in 1955 to great critical and popular success. It earned numerous prizes and had long runs in both India and abroad. In India, the reaction to the film was enthusiastic; "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" wrote that "It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema [...] "Pather Panchali" is pure cinema." In the United Kingdom, <a href="Lindsay%20Anderson">Lindsay Anderson</a> wrote a glowing review of the film. But, the reaction was not uniformly positive. After watching the movie, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a> is reported to have said, "I don't want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands." <a href="Bosley%20Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a>, then the most influential critic of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", wrote a scathing review of the film. Its American distributor Ed Harrison was worried Crowther's review would dissuade audiences, but the film had an exceptionally long run when released in the United States. A film still used on the original poster for the movie featured in "<a href="The%20Family%20of%20Man">The Family of Man</a>", the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> exhibition that was seen by 9 million visitors. It is a low-angle shot of the hero Apu having his hair brushed by his sister Durga and adoring mother Sarbojaya. Of the thirteen images the exhibition depicting India it was the only one made by an Indian photographer. Curator <a href="Edward%20Steichen">Edward Steichen</a> credited it to Ray, but because Ray was not known to be a photographer, it is likely the author of this photograph, of a scene directed by Ray, was the film's cinematographer, Subrata Mitra.

Ray's international career started in earnest after the success of his next film, "<a href="Aparajito">Aparajito</a>" ("The Unvanquished"). This film shows the eternal struggle between the ambitions of a young man, Apu, and the mother who loves him. Critics such as <a href="Mrinal%20Sen">Mrinal Sen</a> and <a href="Ritwik%20Ghatak">Ritwik Ghatak</a> rank it higher than Ray's first film. "Aparajito" won the <a href="Golden%20Lion">Golden Lion</a> at the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>, bringing Ray considerable acclaim. Before completing "The Apu Trilogy", Ray directed and released two other films: the comic "<a href="Parash%20Pathar">Parash Pathar</a>" ("The Philosopher's Stone"), and "<a href="Jalsaghar">Jalsaghar</a>" ("The Music Room"), a film about the decadence of the <a href="Zamindar">Zamindar</a>s, considered one of his most important works.

While making "Aparajito", Ray had not planned a trilogy, but after he was asked about the idea in Venice, it appealed to him. He finished the last of the trilogy, "<a href="The%20World%20of%20Apu">Apur Sansar</a>" ("The World of Apu") in 1959. Critics <a href="Robin%20Wood%20%28critic%29">Robin Wood</a> and <a href="Aparna%20Sen">Aparna Sen</a> found this to be the supreme achievement of the trilogy. Ray introduced two of his favourite actors, <a href="Soumitra%20Chatterjee">Soumitra Chatterjee</a> and <a href="Sharmila%20Tagore">Sharmila Tagore</a>, in this film. It opens with Apu living in a Calcutta house in near-poverty. He becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna. The scenes of their life together form "one of the cinema's classic affirmative depictions of married life." They suffer tragedy. After "Apur Sansar" was harshly criticised by a Bengali critic, Ray wrote an article defending it. He rarely responded to critics during his filmmaking career, but also later defended his film "Charulata", his personal favourite.

Ray wrote his memoirs during his filming of the Apu Trilogy which has been published as .

Ray's film successes had little influence on his personal life in the years to come. He continued to live with his wife and children in a rented house, with his mother, uncle and other members of his extended family.

During this period, Ray composed films on the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a> period (such as "<a href="Devi%20%281960%20film%29">Devi</a>"), a documentary on Tagore, a comic film ("Mahapurush") and his first film from an original screenplay ("Kanchenjungha"). He also made a series of films that, taken together, are considered by critics among the most deeply felt portrayals of Indian women on screen.

Ray followed "Apur Sansar" with "Devi" ("The Goddess"), a film in which he examined the superstitions in <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> society. Sharmila Tagore starred as Doyamoyee, a young wife who is <a href="Kali">deified</a> by her father-in-law. Ray was worried that the censor board might block his film, or at least make him re-cut it, but "Devi" was spared. In 1961, on the insistence of Prime minister <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, Ray was commissioned to make <a href="Rabindranath%20Tagore%20%28film%29">a documentary</a> on <a href="Rabindranath%20Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, on the occasion of the poet's birth centennial, a tribute to the person who likely most influenced Ray. Due to limited footage of Tagore, Ray faced the challenge of making a film out of mainly static material. He said that it took as much work as three feature films.

In the same year, together with <a href="Subhas%20Mukhopadhyay%20%28poet%29">Subhas Mukhopadhyay</a> and others, Ray was able to revive "<a href="Sandesh%20%28magazine%29">Sandesh</a>", the children's magazine which his grandfather once published. Ray had been saving money for some years to make this possible. A duality in the name ("Sandesh" means both "news" in Bengali and also a sweet popular dessert) set the tone of the magazine (both educational and entertaining). Ray began to make illustrations for it, as well as to write stories and essays for children. Writing became his major source of income.

In 1962, Ray directed "<a href="Kanchenjungha">Kanchenjungha</a>." Based on his first original screenplay, it was his first film in colour. The film tells of an upper-class family spending an afternoon in <a href="Darjeeling">Darjeeling</a>, a picturesque hill town in West Bengal. They try to arrange the engagement of their youngest daughter to a highly paid engineer educated in London. He had first conceived shooting the film in a large mansion, but later decided to film it in the famous hill town. He used the many shades of light and mist to reflect the tension in the drama. Ray noted that while his script allowed shooting to be possible under any lighting conditions, a commercial film contingent present at the same time in Darjeeling failed to shoot a single scene, as they only wanted to do so in sunshine.

In the sixties, Ray visited Japan and took particular pleasure in meeting the filmmaker <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>, for whom he had very high regard. While at home, he would take an occasional break from the hectic city life by going to places such as Darjeeling or <a href="Puri">Puri</a> to complete a script in isolation.

In 1964 Ray made "<a href="Charulata">Charulata</a>" ("The Lonely Wife"); it was the culmination of this period of work, and regarded by many critics as his most accomplished film. Based on "<a href="Nastanirh">Nastanirh</a>", a short story of Tagore, the film tells of a lonely wife, Charu, in 19th-century Bengal, and her growing feelings for her brother-in-law Amal. Critics have referred to this as Ray's <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozartian</a> masterpiece. He said the film contained the fewest flaws among his work, and it was his only work which, given a chance, he would make exactly the same way. "Charulata" won him the Best Director prize at the <a href="Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival">Berlin Film Festival</a>. <a href="Madhabi%20Mukherjee">Madhabi Mukherjee</a>'s performance as Charu, and the work of both Subrata Mitra and Bansi Chandragupta in the film, have been highly praised. Other films in this period include "<a href="Mahanagar">Mahanagar</a>" ("The Big City"), "<a href="Teen%20Kanya">Teen Kanya</a>" ("Three Daughters"), "<a href="Abhijan">Abhijan</a>" ("The Expedition"), "<a href="Kapurush">Kapurush</a>" ("The Coward") and "<a href="Mahapurush">Mahapurush</a>" ("Holy Man").

In the post-"Charulata" period, Ray took on projects of increasing variety, ranging from fantasy to science fiction to <a href="Detective%20fiction">detective films</a> to <a href="Historical%20drama%20film">historical drama</a>. Ray also made considerable formal experimentation during this period. He expressed contemporary issues of Indian life, responding to a perceived lack of these issues in his films. The first major film in this period is "<a href="Nayak%20%281966%20film%29">Nayak</a>" ("The Hero"), the story of a screen hero travelling in a train and meeting a young, sympathetic female journalist. Starring <a href="Uttam%20Kumar">Uttam Kumar</a> and Sharmila Tagore, in the twenty-four hours of the journey, the film explores the inner conflict of the apparently highly successful <a href="matin%C3%A9e%20idol">matinée idol</a>. In spite of the film's receiving a "Critics prize" at the <a href="Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival">Berlin International Film Festival</a>, it had a generally muted reception.

In 1967, Ray wrote a script for a film to be called "<a href="The%20Alien%20%281960s%20film%29">The Alien</a>", based on his short story "Bankubabur Bandhu" ("Banku Babu's Friend"), which he wrote in 1962 for "<a href="Sandesh%20%28magazine%29">Sandesh</a>", the Ray family magazine. <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> was the producer for what was a planned US-India co-production, and <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a> and <a href="Peter%20Sellers">Peter Sellers</a> were cast as the leading actors. Ray found that his script had been copyrighted and the fee appropriated by <a href="Michael%20Wilson%20%28writer%29">Michael Wilson</a>. Wilson had initially approached Ray through their mutual friend, <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, to represent him in Hollywood. Wilson copyrighted the script credited to "Mike Wilson & Satyajit Ray", although he contributed only one word. Ray later said that he never received a penny for the script. After Brando dropped out of the project, the project tried to replace him with <a href="James%20Coburn">James Coburn</a>, but Ray became disillusioned and returned to Calcutta. Columbia expressed interest in reviving the project several times in the 1970s and 1980s, but nothing came of it. When "<a href="E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial">E.T.</a>" was released in 1982, Clarke and Ray saw similarities in the film to his earlier "Alien" script. Ray claimed that this film plagiarized his script. Ray said that Steven Spielberg's movie "would not have been possible without my script of 'The Alien' being available throughout America in mimeographed copies." Spielberg denied any plagiarism by saying, "I was a kid in high school when this script was circulating in Hollywood." (Spielberg actually graduated high school in 1965 and released his first film in 1968). Besides "The Alien", two other unrealised projects that Ray had intended to direct were adaptations of the ancient <a href="Indian%20epic%20poetry">Indian epic</a>, the "<a href="Mah%C4%81bh%C4%81rata">Mahābhārata</a>", and <a href="E.%20M.%20Forster">E. M. Forster</a>'s 1924 novel "<a href="A%20Passage%20to%20India">A Passage to India</a>".
In 1969, Ray released what would be commercially the most successful of his films. Based on a children's story written by his grandfather, "<a href="Goopy%20Gyne%20Bagha%20Byne">Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne</a>" ("The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha"), it is a <a href="musical%20film">musical</a> fantasy. Goopy the singer and Bagha the drummer, endowed with three gifts by the King of Ghosts, set out on a fantastic journey. They try to stop an impending war between two neighboring kingdoms. Among his most expensive enterprises, the film project was difficult to finance. Ray abandoned his desire to shoot it in color, as he turned down an offer that would have forced him to cast a certain <a href="Hindi%20film">Hindi film</a> actor as the lead.

Ray made a film from a novel by the young poet and writer, <a href="Sunil%20Gangopadhyay">Sunil Gangopadhyay</a>. Featuring a musical motif structure acclaimed as more complex than "Charulata", "<a href="Aranyer%20Din%20Ratri">Aranyer Din Ratri</a>" ("Days and Nights in the Forest") traces four urban young men going to the forests for a vacation. They try to leave their daily lives behind. All but one of them become involved in encounters with women, which becomes a deep study of the Indian middle class. According to Robin Wood, "a single sequence [of the film] ... would offer material for a short essay".

After "Aranyer", Ray addressed contemporary Bengali life. He completed what became known as the "<a href="Calcutta%20trilogy">Calcutta trilogy</a>": "<a href="Pratidwandi">Pratidwandi</a>" (1970), "<a href="Seemabaddha">Seemabaddha</a>" (1971), and "<a href="Jana%20Aranya">Jana Aranya</a>" (1975), three films that were conceived separately but had thematic connections. "Pratidwandi" ("The Adversary") is about an idealist young graduate; if disillusioned at the end of film, he is still uncorrupted. "Jana Aranya" ("The Middleman") showed a young man giving in to the culture of corruption to make a living. "Seemabaddha" ("Company Limited") portrayed an already successful man giving up his morality for further gains. In the first film, "Pratidwandi", Ray introduces a new, elliptical narrative style, such as scenes in negative, dream sequences, and abrupt flashbacks. In the 1970s, Ray adapted two of his popular stories as detective films. Though mainly addressed to children and young adults, both "<a href="Sonar%20Kella">Sonar Kella</a>" ("The Golden Fortress") and "<a href="Joi%20Baba%20Felunath%20%28film%29">Joi Baba Felunath</a>" ("The Elephant God") found some critical following.

Ray considered making a film on the <a href="Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> but later abandoned the idea. He said that, as a filmmaker, he was more interested in the travails of the refugees and not the politics. In 1977, Ray completed "<a href="Shatranj%20Ke%20Khilari%20%28film%29">Shatranj Ke Khilari</a>" ("The Chess Players"), a <a href="Hindi/Urdu">Hindi/Urdu</a> film based on a short story by <a href="Munshi%20Premchand">Munshi Premchand</a>. It was set in <a href="Lucknow">Lucknow</a> in the state of <a href="Oudh">Oudh</a>, a year before the <a href="Indian%20rebellion%20of%201857">Indian rebellion of 1857</a>. A commentary on issues related to the colonisation of India by the British, this was Ray's first feature film in a language other than Bengali. It is his most expensive and star-studded film, featuring <a href="Sanjeev%20Kumar%20%28actor%29">Sanjeev Kumar</a>, <a href="Saeed%20Jaffrey">Saeed Jaffrey</a>, <a href="Amjad%20Khan%20%28actor%29">Amjad Khan</a>, <a href="Shabana%20Azmi">Shabana Azmi</a>, <a href="Victor%20Bannerjee">Victor Bannerjee</a> and <a href="Richard%20Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>.

In 1980, Ray made a sequel to "Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne", a somewhat political "<a href="Hirak%20Rajar%20Deshe">Hirak Rajar Deshe</a>" ("Kingdom of Diamonds"). The kingdom of the evil Diamond King, or "Hirok Raj," is an allusion to India during <a href="Indira%20Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>'s <a href="Indian%20Emergency%20%281975%20-%2077%29">emergency period</a>. Along with his acclaimed short film "<a href="Pikoo%20%28film%29">Pikoo</a>" ("Pikoo's Diary") and hour-long <a href="Hindi%20language">Hindi</a> film, "Sadgati," this was the culmination of his work in this period.

In 1983, while working on "<a href="Ghare%20Baire%20%28film%29">Ghare Baire</a>" ("Home and the World"), Ray suffered a heart attack; it would severely limit his productivity in the remaining 9 years of his life. "Ghare Baire" was completed in 1984 with the help of Ray's son (who operated the camera from then on) because of his health condition. He had wanted to film this <a href="Ghare%20Baire">Tagore novel</a> on the dangers of fervent nationalism for a long time, and wrote a first draft of a script for it in the 1940s. In spite of rough patches due to Ray's illness, the film did receive some critical acclaim. It had the first kiss fully portrayed in Ray's films. In 1987, he made <a href="Sukumar%20Ray%20%28film%29">a documentary</a> on his father, <a href="Sukumar%20Ray">Sukumar Ray</a>.

Ray's last three films, made after his recovery and with medical strictures in place, were shot mostly indoors, and have a distinctive style. They have more dialogue than his earlier films and are often regarded as inferior to his earlier body of work. The first, "<a href="Ganashatru">Ganashatru</a>" ("An Enemy of the People") is an adaptation of the <a href="An%20Enemy%20of%20the%20People">Ibsen play</a>, and considered the weakest of the three. Ray recovered some of his form in his 1990 film "<a href="Shakha%20Proshakha">Shakha Proshakha</a>" ("Branches of the Tree"). In it, an old man, who has lived a life of honesty, comes to learn of the corruption of three of his sons. The final scene shows the father finding solace only in the companionship of his fourth son, who is uncorrupted but mentally ill. Ray's last film, "<a href="Agantuk">Agantuk</a>" ("The Stranger"), is lighter in mood but not in theme. When a long-lost uncle arrives to visit his niece in Calcutta, he arouses suspicion as to his motive. This provokes far-ranging questions in the film about civilisation.

In 1992, Ray's health deteriorated due to heart complications. He was admitted to a hospital, but never recovered. The <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> awarded him an <a href="Academy%20Honorary%20Award">Honorary Academy Award</a>. Ray is the first and the only Indian, yet, to receive the honor. Twenty-four days before his death, Ray accepted the award in a gravely ill condition, calling it the "Best achievement of [his] movie-making career." He died on 23 April 1992.

Satyajit Ray considered script-writing to be an integral part of direction. Initially he refused to make a film in any language other than <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali</a>. In his two non-Bengali feature films, he wrote the script in English; translators interpreted it in Hindi or Urdu under Ray's supervision. Ray's eye for detail was matched by that of his art director <a href="Bansi%20Chandragupta">Bansi Chandragupta</a>. His influence on the early films was so important that Ray would always write scripts in English before creating a Bengali version, so that the non-Bengali Chandragupta would be able to read it. The craft of <a href="Subrata%20Mitra">Subrata Mitra</a> garnered praise for the cinematography of Ray's films. A number of critics thought that his departure from Ray's crew lowered the quality of <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a> in the following films. Though Ray openly praised Mitra, his single-mindedness in taking over operation of the camera after "Charulata" caused Mitra to stop working for him after 1966. Mitra developed "bounce lighting", a technique to reflect light from cloth to create a diffused, realistic light even on a set. Ray acknowledged his debts to <a href="Jean-Luc%20Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a> and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Truffaut">François Truffaut</a> of the <a href="French%20New%20Wave">French New Wave</a> for introducing new technical and cinematic innovations.

Ray's regular film editor was <a href="Dulal%20Datta">Dulal Datta</a>, but the director usually dictated the editing while Datta did the actual work. Because of financial reasons and Ray's meticulous planning, his films were mostly cut in-camera (apart from "Pather Panchali"). At the beginning of his career, Ray worked with <a href="Indian%20classical%20music">Indian classical music</a>ians, including <a href="Ravi%20Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a>, <a href="Vilayat%20Khan">Vilayat Khan</a>, and <a href="Ali%20Akbar%20Khan">Ali Akbar Khan</a>. He found that their first loyalty was to musical traditions, and not to his film. He had a greater understanding of Western classical forms, which he wanted to use for his films set in an urban milieu. Starting with "Teen Kanya", Ray began to compose his own scores.

He used actors of diverse backgrounds, from famous film stars to people who had never seen a film (as in "Aparajito"). <a href="Robin%20Wood%20%28critic%29">Robin Wood</a> and others have lauded him as the best director of children, pointing out memorable performances in the roles of Apu and Durga ("Pather Panchali"), Ratan ("Postmaster") and Mukul ("Sonar Kella"). Depending on the talent or experience of the actor, Ray varied the intensity of his direction, from virtually nothing with actors such as <a href="Utpal%20Dutt">Utpal Dutt</a>, to using the actor as a puppet (<a href="Subir%20Banerjee">Subir Banerjee</a> as young Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna). Actors who had worked for Ray praised his customary trust but said he could also treat incompetence with total contempt.
With full of admiration of his cinematic style and impeccable craft, British Film Academy Director Roger Manvell had said, “In the restrained style he has adopted, Ray has become a master of technique. He takes his timing from the nature of the people and their environment; his camera is the intent, unobtrusive observer of reactions; his editing the discreet, economical transition from one value to the next." 
Though a master technician and a superb craftsman, Ray always credited life to be the best kind of inspiration for a popular medium like cinema. In his own words, "For a popular medium, the best kind of inspiration should derive from life and have its roots in it. No amount of technical polish can make up for artificiality of the theme and the dishonesty of treatment." 

Ray created two popular fictional characters in Bengali children's literature—<a href="Feluda">Feluda</a>, a detective, and <a href="Professor%20Shonku">Professor Shonku</a>, a scientist. The Feluda stories are narrated by Topesh Ranjan Mitra aka Topse, his teenage cousin, something of a <a href="Doctor%20Watson">Watson</a> to Feluda's <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Holmes</a>. The science fictions of Shonku are presented as a diary discovered after the scientist had mysteriously disappeared. Ray also wrote a collection of <a href="nonsense%20verse">nonsense verse</a> named "<a href="Today%20Bandha%20Ghorar%20Dim">Today Bandha Ghorar Dim</a>," which includes a translation of <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s "<a href="Jabberwocky">Jabberwocky</a>". He wrote a collection of humorous stories of <a href="Nasreddin">Mullah Nasiruddin</a> in Bengali.

His short stories were published as collections of 12 stories, in which the overall title played with the word twelve (for example "Aker pitthe dui", or literally "Two on top of one"). Ray's interest in puzzles and puns is reflected in his stories. Ray's short stories give full rein to his interest in the macabre, in suspense and other aspects that he avoided in film, making for an interesting psychological study. Most of his writings have been translated into English. Most of his screenplays have been published in Bengali in the literary journal "Eksan". Ray wrote an autobiography about his childhood years, "<a href="Jakhan%20Choto%20Chilam">Jakhan Choto Chilam</a>" (1982), translated to English as Childhood Days.

Ray penned his experiences during the period when he filmed the Apu Trilogy in his memoirs titled .

He also wrote essays on film, published as the collections: "<a href="Our%20Films%2C%20Their%20Films">Our Films, Their Films</a>" (1976), "<a href="Bishoy%20Chalachchitra">Bishoy Chalachchitra</a>" (1976), and "<a href="Ekei%20Bole%20Shooting">Ekei Bole Shooting</a>" (1979). During the mid-1990s, Ray's film essays and an anthology of short stories were also published in English in the West. "<a href="Our%20Films%2C%20Their%20Films">Our Films, Their Films</a>" is an anthology of film criticism by Ray. The book contains articles and personal journal excerpts. The book is presented in two sections: Ray first discusses <a href="Cinema%20of%20India">Indian film</a>, before turning his attention toward Hollywood, specific filmmakers (<a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> and <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>), and movements such as <a href="Italian%20neorealism">Italian neorealism</a>. His book "<a href="Bishoy%20Chalachchitra">Bishoy Chalachchitra</a>" was published in translation in 2006 as "Speaking of Films". It contains a compact description of his philosophy of different aspects of the cinemas.

Satyajit Ray designed four typefaces for roman script named Ray Roman, Ray Bizarre, Daphnis, and Holiday script, apart from numerous Bengali ones for the "<a href="Sandesh%20%28magazine%29">Sandesh</a>" magazine. Ray Roman and Ray Bizarre won an international competition in 1971. In certain circles of Calcutta, Ray continued to be known as an eminent graphic designer, well into his film career. Ray illustrated all his books and designed covers for them, as well as creating all publicity material for his films, i.e., Ray's artistic playing with the Bengali graphemes was also revealed in the cine posters and cine promo-brochures' covers. He also designed covers of several books by other authors. In his calligraphic technique there are deep impacts of:
(a) Artistic pattern of European musical staff notation in the graphemic syntagms;
(b) <a href="alpana">alpana</a> ("ritual painting" mainly practiced by Bengali women at the time of religious festival; the term denotes 'to coat with'. Generally categorized as "Folk"-Art cf. in Ray's graphemes representations.

Thus, so-called division between classical and folk art is blurred in Ray's representation of Bengali graphemes. The three-tier X-height of Bengali graphemes was presented in a manner of musical map and the contours, curves in between horizontal and vertical meeting-point, follow the patterns of alpana. It is also noticed that the metamorphosis of graphemes (This might be designated as "Archewriting") as a living object/subject in Ray's positive manipulation of Bengali graphemes.

Ray's work has been described as full of <a href="humanism">humanism</a> and universality, and of a deceptive simplicity with deep underlying complexity. The Japanese director <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a> said, "Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon." But his detractors find his films glacially slow, moving like a "majestic snail." Some find his work <a href="anti-modern">anti-modern</a>; they criticize him for lacking the new modes of expression or experimentation found in works of Ray's contemporaries, such as <a href="Jean-Luc%20Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>. As <a href="Stanley%20Kauffmann">Stanley Kauffmann</a> wrote, some critics believe that Ray assumes that viewers "can be interested in a film that simply dwells in its characters, rather than one that imposes dramatic patterns on their lives." Ray said he could do nothing about the slow pace. <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Kurosawa</a> defended him by saying that Ray's films were not slow, "His work can be described as flowing composedly, like a big river".

Critics have often compared Ray to artists in the cinema and other media, such as <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov</a>, <a href="Jean%20Renoir">Renoir</a>, <a href="Vittorio%20De%20Sica">De Sica</a>, <a href="Howard%20Hawks">Hawks</a> or <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>. The writer <a href="V.%20S.%20Naipaul">V. S. Naipaul</a> compared a scene in "Shatranj Ki Khiladi" ("The Chess Players") to a Shakespearean play; he wrote, "only three hundred words are spoken but goodness! – terrific things happen." Even critics who did not like the <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a> of Ray's films generally acknowledged his ability to encompass a whole culture with all its nuances. Ray's obituary in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" included the question, "Who else can compete?" His work was promoted in France by "The Studio des Ursuline" cinema. With full of positive admiration for most of Ray's films, celebrated film critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> had cited "Apu Triology" among the great movies.

Praising his contribution to the world of cinema, <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> mentions: "His work is in the company of that of living contemporaries like Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa and Federico Fellini."
Director of classics like "The Godafther" and "Apocalypse Now", Francis Ford Coppola cited him (Ray) to be a major influence in life. With deep words of praise for Ray's 1960 classic "Devi", what he had considered to be his best work and a "cinematic milestone"; he further admitted to know of Indian cinema through Ray's works. 
Recently, on a visit to India, celebrated filmmaker <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> expresses his admiration for Ray's first film, "Pather Panchali". Nolan expressed, "I have had the pleasure of watching [Satyajit] Ray’s Pather Panchali recently, which I hadn’t seen before. I think it is one of the best films ever made. It is an extraordinary piece of work."

Political ideologues took issue with Ray's work. In a public debate during the 1960s, Ray and the <a href="Marxist">Marxist</a> filmmaker <a href="Mrinal%20Sen">Mrinal Sen</a> engaged in an argument. Sen criticised him for casting a matinée idol such as <a href="Uttam%20Kumar">Uttam Kumar</a>, whom he considered a compromise. Ray said that Sen only attacked "easy targets", i.e. the Bengali middle-classes. However Ray himself has made movies on Bengali middle class in films like <a href="Pratidwandi">Pratidwandi</a> and <a href="Jana%20Aranya">Jana Aranya</a> set during the period of the <a href="naxalite%20movement">naxalite movement</a> in <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>. Advocates of socialism said that Ray was not "committed" to the cause of the nation's downtrodden classes; some critics accused him of glorifying poverty in "Pather Panchali" and "<a href="Ashani%20Sanket">Ashani Sanket</a>" (Distant Thunder) through lyricism and aesthetics. They said he provided no solution to conflicts in the stories, and was unable to overcome his <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeois</a> background. During the <a href="naxalite">naxalite</a> movements in the 1970s, agitators once came close to causing physical harm to his son, Sandip. Early in 1980, Ray was criticised by an Indian <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">M.P.</a> and former actress <a href="Nargis%20Dutt">Nargis Dutt</a>, who accused Ray of "exporting poverty." She wanted him to make films to represent "Modern India."

Satyajit Ray is a cultural icon in India and in Bengali communities worldwide. Following his death, the city of Calcutta came to a virtual standstill, as hundreds of thousands of people gathered around his house to pay their last respects. Satyajit Ray's influence has been widespread and deep in <a href="Cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal">Bengali cinema</a>; a number of Bengali directors, including <a href="Aparna%20Sen">Aparna Sen</a>, <a href="Rituparno%20Ghosh">Rituparno Ghosh</a> and <a href="Gautam%20Ghose">Gautam Ghose</a> as well as <a href="Vishal%20Bhardwaj">Vishal Bhardwaj</a>, <a href="Dibakar%20Banerjee">Dibakar Banerjee</a>, <a href="Shyam%20Benegal">Shyam Benegal</a> and <a href="Sujoy%20Ghosh">Sujoy Ghosh</a> from Hindi cinema in India, <a href="Tareq%20Masud">Tareq Masud</a> and <a href="Tanvir%20Mokammel">Tanvir Mokammel</a> in Bangladesh, and <a href="Aneel%20Ahmad">Aneel Ahmad</a> in England, have been influenced by his film craft. Across the spectrum, filmmakers such as <a href="Budhdhadeb%20Dasgupta">Budhdhadeb Dasgupta</a>, <a href="Mrinal%20Sen">Mrinal Sen</a> and <a href="Adoor%20Gopalakrishnan">Adoor Gopalakrishnan</a> have acknowledged his seminal contribution to Indian cinema. Beyond India, filmmakers such as <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, <a href="Francis%20Ford%20Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a>, <a href="James%20Ivory%20%28director%29">James Ivory</a>, <a href="Abbas%20Kiarostami">Abbas Kiarostami</a>, <a href="Elia%20Kazan">Elia Kazan</a>, <a href="William%20Wyler">William Wyler</a>, François Truffaut, <a href="Carlos%20Saura">Carlos Saura</a>, <a href="Isao%20Takahata">Isao Takahata</a>, <a href="Wes%20Anderson">Wes Anderson</a>, <a href="Danny%20Boyle">Danny Boyle</a> <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> and many other noted filmmakers from all over the world have been influenced by his cinematic style, with many others such as <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a> praising his work. <a href="Gregory%20Nava">Gregory Nava</a>'s 1995 film "<a href="My%20Family%20%28film%29">My Family</a>" had a final scene that repeated that of "Apur Sansar". <a href="Ira%20Sachs">Ira Sachs</a>'s 2005 work "<a href="Forty%20Shades%20of%20Blue">Forty Shades of Blue</a>" was a loose remake of "Charulata." Other references to Ray films are found, for example, in recent works such as "<a href="Sacred%20Evil">Sacred Evil</a>", the "<a href="Elements%20trilogy">Elements trilogy</a>" of <a href="Deepa%20Mehta">Deepa Mehta</a>. According to Michael Sragow of "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic Monthly</a>", the "youthful <a href="Coming%20of%20age">coming-of-age</a> <a href="Drama%20film">dramas</a> that have flooded art houses since the mid-fifties owe a tremendous debt to the <a href="The%20Apu%20Trilogy">Apu trilogy</a>". The trilogy also introduced the <a href="Reflector%20%28photography%29%23Bounce%20lighting">bounce lighting</a> technique. "<a href="Kanchenjungha">Kanchenjungha</a>" (1962) introduced a narrative structure that resembles later <a href="hyperlink%20cinema">hyperlink cinema</a>. "<a href="Pratidwandi">Pratidwandi</a>" (1972) helped pioneer <a href="Negative%20%28photography%29">photo-negative</a> <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a> and X-ray digression techniques.
Together with <a href="Madhabi%20Mukherjee">Madhabi Mukherjee</a>, Ray was the first Indian film figure to be featured on a foreign stamp (<a href="Dominica">Dominica</a>).

Iranian master filmmaker, <a href="Majid%20Majidi">Majid Majidi</a> has expressed his deep admiration to Satyajit Ray. While discussing the inspirations for making his first feature film on India <a href="Beyond%20the%20Clouds%20%282017%20film%29">Beyond the Clouds (2017 film)</a>, which is a foreign land and culture for the director; Majidi expressed, "I have learned a lot about India based on the works of remarkable Indian director Satyajit Ray so it was my dream to make a film in his land. His view point is very valuable to me and I love whatever he has done, so one of the main reasons behind making this film is my admiration for Satyajit Ray and his work".

Many literary works include references to Ray or his work, including <a href="Saul%20Bellow">Saul Bellow</a>'s "<a href="Herzog%20%28novel%29">Herzog</a>" and <a href="J.%20M.%20Coetzee">J. M.

In 1993, <a href="UC%20Santa%20Cruz">UC Santa Cruz</a> established the Satyajit Ray Film and Study collection, and in 1995, the Government of India set up <a href="Satyajit%20Ray%20Film%20and%20Television%20Institute">Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute</a> for studies related to film. In 2007, the BBC declared that two "Feluda" stories would be made into radio programs. During the <a href="London%20Film%20Festival">London Film Festival</a>, a regular "Satyajit Ray Award" is given to a first-time feature director whose film best captures "the artistry, compassion and humanity of Ray's vision". <a href="Wes%20Anderson">Wes Anderson</a> has claimed Ray as an influence on his work; his 2007 film, "<a href="The%20Darjeeling%20Limited">The Darjeeling Limited</a>", set in India, is dedicated to Ray. Ray also a graphic designer, designed most of his film posters, combining folk-art and calligraphy to create themes ranging from mysterious, surreal to comical; an exhibition his posters was held at <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> in 2013.

In 2016, during the shooting of the film "Double Feluda", Satyajit's only son, Sandip Ray, filmed his father's famous library.

McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II

The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) AV-8B Harrier II is a single-engine <a href="ground-attack%20aircraft">ground-attack aircraft</a> that constitutes the second generation of the <a href="Harrier%20Jump%20Jet">Harrier Jump Jet</a> family. Capable of <a href="V/STOL">vertical or short takeoff and landing</a> (V/STOL), the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20Harrier">Hawker Siddeley Harrier</a>, the first operational V/STOL aircraft. The aircraft is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> of ground troops to armed <a href="Reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance</a>. The AV-8B is used by the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> (USMC), the <a href="Spanish%20Navy">Spanish Navy</a>, and the <a href="Italian%20Navy">Italian Navy</a>. A variant of the AV-8B, the <a href="British%20Aerospace%20Harrier%20II">British Aerospace Harrier II</a>, was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat <a href="Trainer%20%28aircraft%29">trainer</a>.

The project that eventually led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Pegasus">Pegasus engine</a> to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Due to budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.

Following the withdrawal of the UK, <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas">McDonnell Douglas</a> extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, one extra <a href="hardpoint">hardpoint</a> per wing, and other structural and <a href="aerodynamic">aerodynamic</a> refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its <a href="maiden%20flight">maiden flight</a> in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but not pursued. The UK, through <a href="British%20Aerospace">British Aerospace</a>, re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant work-share in the project. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> and <a href="BAE%20Systems">BAE Systems</a> have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.

Typically operated from small <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s, large <a href="amphibious%20assault%20ship">amphibious assault ship</a>s and simple <a href="forward%20operating%20base">forward operating base</a>s, AV-8Bs have participated in numerous military and <a href="Humanitarian%20intervention">humanitarian operations</a>, proving themselves versatile assets. <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> General <a href="Norman%20Schwarzkopf">Norman Schwarzkopf</a> named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. The aircraft took part in combat during the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in <a href="Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in <a href="Operation%20Odyssey%20Dawn">Operation Odyssey Dawn</a> in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage of time spent in critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II">Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II</a>, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20Harrier">first-generation Harriers</a> entered service with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) and <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> (USMC), but were handicapped in range and <a href="payload">payload</a>. In <a href="STOL">short takeoff and landing</a> configuration, the AV-8A (American designation for the Harrier) carried less than half the 4,000 lb (1,800 kg) payload of the smaller <a href="Douglas%20A-4%20Skyhawk">A-4 Skyhawk</a>, over a more limited radius. To address this issue, Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas began joint development of a more capable version of the Harrier in 1973. Early efforts concentrated on an improved <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Pegasus">Pegasus engine</a>, designated the Pegasus 15, which was being tested by <a href="Bristol%20Siddeley">Bristol Siddeley</a>. Although more powerful, the engine's diameter was too large by to fit into the Harrier easily.

In December 1973, a joint American and British team completed a project document defining an Advanced Harrier powered by the Pegasus 15 engine. The Advanced Harrier was intended to replace the original RAF and USMC Harriers, as well as the USMC's A-4. The aim of the Advanced Harrier was to double the AV-8's payload and range, and was therefore unofficially named AV-16. The British government pulled out of the project in March 1975 owing to decreased defense funding, rising costs, and the RAF's insufficient 60-aircraft requirement. With development costs estimated to be around <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>180–200 million (1974 British pounds), the United States was unwilling to fund development by itself, and ended the project later that year.

Despite the project's termination, the two companies continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted to existing operational aircraft, while McDonnell Douglas independently pursued a less ambitious, though still expensive, project catering to the needs of the US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items—such as the larger Pegasus engine—McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and engine for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.

As the USMC wanted a substantially improved Harrier without the development of a new engine, the plan for Harrier II development was authorized by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">United States Department of Defense</a> (DoD) in 1976. The United States Navy (USN), which had traditionally procured military aircraft for the USMC, insisted that the new design be verified with flight testing. McDonnell Douglas modified two AV-8As with new wings, revised intakes, redesigned exhaust nozzles, and other aerodynamic changes; the modified forward fuselage and cockpit found on all subsequent aircraft were not incorporated on these prototypes. Designated YAV-8B, the first converted aircraft flew on 9 November 1978, at the hands of Charles Plummer. The aircraft performed three vertical take-offs and hovered for seven minutes at <a href="Lambert%E2%80%93St.%20Louis%20International%20Airport">Lambert–St. Louis International Airport</a>. The second aircraft followed on 19 February 1979, but crashed that November due to engine <a href="flameout">flameout</a>; the pilot ejected safely. Flight testing of these modified AV-8s continued into 1979. The results showed greater than expected <a href="drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a>, hampering the aircraft's maximum speed. Further refinements to the aerodynamic profile yielded little improvement. Positive test results in other areas, including payload, range, and V/STOL performance, led to the award of a development contract in 1979. The contract stipulated a procurement of 12 aircraft initially, followed by a further 324.
Between 1978 and 1980, the DoD and USN repeatedly attempted to terminate the AV-8B program. There had previously been conflict between the USMC and USN over budgetary issues. At the time, the USN wanted to procure A-18s for its ground attack force and, to cut costs, pressured the USMC to adopt the similarly-designed F-18 fighter instead of the AV-8B to fulfill the role of close air support (both designs were eventually amalgamated to create the multirole <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a>). Despite these bureaucratic obstacles, in 1981, the DoD included the Harrier II in its annual budget and five-year defense plan. The USN declined to participate in the procurement, citing the limited range and payload compared with conventional aircraft.

In August 1981 the program received a boost when <a href="British%20Aerospace">British Aerospace</a> (BAe) and McDonnell Douglas signed a <a href="memorandum%20of%20understanding">memorandum of understanding</a> (MoU), marking the UK's re-entry into the program. The British government was enticed by the lower cost of acquiring Harriers promised by a large production run, and the fact that the US was shouldering the expense of development. Under the agreement BAe was relegated to the position of a subcontractor, instead of the full partner status that would have been the case had the UK not left the program. Consequently, the company received, in man-hours, 40 percent of the airframe work-share. Aircraft production took place at McDonnell Douglas' facilities in suburban <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, and manufacturing by BAe at its <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Thames">Kingston</a> and <a href="Dunsfold">Dunsfold</a> facilities in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, England. Meanwhile, 75 percent work-share for the engine went to <a href="Rolls-Royce%20plc">Rolls-Royce</a>, which had previously absorbed Bristol Siddeley, with the remaining 25 percent assigned to <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney">Pratt & Whitney</a>. The two companies planned to manufacture 400 Harrier IIs, with the USMC expected to procure 336 aircraft and the RAF, 60.

Four full-scale development (FSD) aircraft were constructed. The first of these (<a href="United%20States%20military%20aircraft%20serials%23United%20States%20Navy%20and%20Marine%20Corps">BuNo</a> 161396), used mainly for testing performance and handling qualities, made its maiden flight on 5 November 1981, piloted by Plummer. The second and third FSD aircraft, which introduced wing <a href="Leading-edge%20extension">leading-edge root extensions</a> and revised engine intakes, first flew in April the following year; the fourth followed in January 1984. The first production AV-8B was delivered to the <a href="Marine%20Attack%20Training%20Squadron%20203">Marine Attack Training Squadron 203</a> (VMAT-203) at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Cherry%20Point">Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point</a> (MCAS Cherry Point) on 12 December 1983, and officially handed over one month later. The last of the initial batch of 12 was delivered in January 1985 to the front-line <a href="Marine%20Attack%20Squadron%20331">Marine Attack Squadron 331</a> (VMA-331). The engine used for these aircraft was the F402-RR-404A, with 21,450 lb (95.4 kN) of thrust; aircraft from 1990 onwards received upgraded engines.

During the initial pilot conversion course, it became apparent that the AV-8B exhibited flight characteristics different from the AV-8A. These differences, as well as the <a href="Digital%20data">digital</a> cockpit fitted instead of the analog cockpit of the TAV-8A, necessitated additional pilot training. In 1984, funding for eight AV-8Bs was diverted to the development of a two-seat TAV-8B trainer. The first of the 28 TAV-8Bs eventually procured had its maiden flight on 21 October 1986. This aircraft was delivered to VMAT-203 on 24 July 1987; the TAV-8B was also ordered by Italy and Spain.

With export interest from Brazil, Japan, and Italy serving as a source of encouragement to continue development of the Harrier II, McDonnell Douglas commenced work on a night-attack variant in 1985. With the addition of an infrared sensor and cockpit interface enhancements, the 87th production single-seat AV-8B became the first Harrier II to be modified for night attacks, leaving the McDonnell Douglas production line in June 1987. Flight tests proved successful and the night attack capability was validated. The first of 66 AV-8B(NA)s was delivered to the USMC in September 1989. An equivalent version of the AV-8B(NA) also served with the RAF under the designation GR7; earlier GR5 aircraft were subsequently upgraded to GR7 standards.

In June 1987, as a private venture, BAe, McDonnell Douglas, and <a href="Smiths%20Group">Smiths Industries</a> signed an MoU for the development of what was to become the AV-8B Plus, which saw the addition of radar and increased missile compatibility. The agreement was endorsed by the USMC and, after much consideration, the Spanish and Italian navies developed a joint requirement for a fleet of air-defense Harriers. The United States, Spain, and Italy signed an MoU in September 1990 to define the responsibilities of the three countries and establish a Joint Program Office to manage the program. On 30 November 1990, the USN, acting as an agent for the three participating countries, awarded McDonnell Douglas the contract to develop the improved Harrier. The award was followed by an order from the USMC in December 1990 for 30 new aircraft, and 72 rebuilt from older aircraft. Italy ordered 16 Harrier II Plus and two twin-seat TAV-8B aircraft, while Spain signed a contract for eight aircraft. Production of the AV-8B Harrier II Plus was conducted, in addition to McDonnell Douglas' plant, at <a href="EADS%20CASA">CASA</a>'s facility in <a href="Seville">Seville</a>, Spain, and <a href="Alenia%20Aeronautica">Alenia Aeronautica</a>'s facility in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy. The UK also participated in the program by manufacturing components for the AV-8B.
Production was authorized on 3 June 1992. The maiden flight of the prototype (BuNo 164129) took place on 22 September, marking the start of a successful flight-test program. The first production aircraft was delivered to St. Louis and made its initial flight on 17 March 1993. Deliveries of new aircraft took place from April 1993 to 1995. At the same time, the plan to remanufacture existing AV-8Bs to the Plus standard proceeded. On 11 March 1994, the Defense Acquisition Board approved the program, which initially involved 70 aircraft, with four converted in <a href="financial%20year">financial year</a> 1994. The program planned to use new and refurbished components to rebuild aircraft at a lower cost than manufacturing new ones. Conversion began in April 1994, and the first aircraft was delivered to the USMC in January 1996.

In March 1996, the US <a href="General%20Accounting%20Office">General Accounting Office</a> (GAO) stated that it was cheaper to buy Harrier II Plus aircraft outright than to remanufacture existing AV-8Bs. The USN estimated the cost for remanufacture of each aircraft to be US$23–30 million, instead of $30 million for each new-built aircraft, while the GAO estimated the cost per new aircraft at $24 million. Nevertheless, the program continued and, in 2003, the 72nd and last AV-8B to be remanufactured for the USMC was delivered. Spain also participated in the program, the delivery of its last refurbished aircraft occurring in December 2003, which marked the end of the AV-8B's production; the final new AV-8B had been delivered in 1997.

In the 1990s, <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> and <a href="BAE%20Systems">BAE Systems</a> assumed management of the Harrier family following corporate mergers that saw Boeing acquire McDonnell Douglas and BAe amalgamate with other defense companies to form BAE Systems. Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harriers of all models were delivered. In 2001, "<a href="Flight%20International">Flight International</a>" reported that Taiwan might meet its requirement for a <a href="STOVL">short take off and vertical landing</a> (STOVL) aircraft by purchasing AV-8Bs, outfitted with the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a>'s <a href="AN/APG-66">APG-66</a> radar. A Taiwanese purchase would have allowed the production line to stay open beyond 2005. Despite the possibility of leasing AV-8Bs, interest in the aircraft waned as the country switched its intentions to procuring the F-35 and upgrading its fleet of F-16s.

Although there have been no new AV-8B variants, in 1990 McDonnell Douglas and British Aerospace began discussions on an interim aircraft between the AV-8B and the next generation of advanced STOVL aircraft. The Harrier III would have presented an "evolutionary approach to get the most from the existing aircraft", as many of the structures employed on the <a href="Sea%20Harrier">Sea Harrier</a> and AV-8B would be used. The wing and the <a href="torsion%20box">torsion box</a> were to be enlarged to accommodate extra fuel and hardpoints to improve the aircraft's endurance. Due to the increase in size, the wing would have had <a href="folding%20wing">folding wing</a>tips. To meet the heavier weight of the aircraft, Rolls-Royce was expected to design a Pegasus engine variant that would have produced more thrust than the latest production variant at the time. The Harrier III would have carried weapons such as <a href="AIM-120%20AMRAAM">AIM-120 AMRAAM</a> and <a href="AIM-132%20ASRAAM">AIM-132 ASRAAM</a> missiles. Boeing and BAE Systems continued studying the design until the early 2000s, when the project was abandoned.

In 2013, the USMC was studying potential enhancements to keep the AV-8B Harrier IIs up to date until its planned retirement, such as a helmet-mounted cueing system. It is also predicted that additional work on the aircraft's radars and sensor systems may take place. The USMC's Harrier II fleet was planned to remain in service until 2030, owing to delays with the F-35B and the fact that the Harriers have more <a href="service%20life">service life</a> left than USMC F/A-18 Hornets. However, by 2014 the USMC had decided to retire the AV-8B sooner because changing the transition orders of Harrier II and Hornet fleets to the Lightning II would save $1 billion. After entering service in the mid-2010s, the F-35B will start to replace the AV-8B in 2016, with the AV-8B expected to continue service until 2025. Meanwhile, the AV-8B will receive revamped defensive measures, updated data-link capability and targeting sensors, and improved missiles and rockets, among other enhancements.

The AV-8B Harrier II is a <a href="Subsonic%20aircraft">subsonic</a> attack aircraft of metal and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with <a href="Tailplane">horizontal stabilizers</a> and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent <a href="Dihedral%20%28aircraft%29%23Anhedral">anhedral</a> (downward slope). The aircraft is powered by a single <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Pegasus">Rolls-Royce Pegasus</a> <a href="turbofan">turbofan</a> engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, cold end of the engine and two are near the rear, hot end of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller <a href="Reaction%20control%20system">valve-controlled nozzles</a> in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.

The AV-8B is equipped with one centerline fuselage and six wing <a href="hardpoint">hardpoint</a>s (compared to four wing hardpoints on the original Harrier), along with two fuselage stations for a 25 mm <a href="GAU-12%20Equalizer">GAU-12</a> cannon and ammunition pack. These hardpoints give it the ability to carry a total of of weapons, including <a href="Air-to-air%20missile">air-to-air</a>, <a href="Air-to-surface%20missile">air-to-surface</a>, and <a href="anti-ship%20missile">anti-ship missile</a>s, as well as <a href="Unguided%20bomb">unguided</a> and <a href="guided%20bomb">guided bomb</a>s. The aircraft's internal fuel capacity is , up 50 percent compared to its predecessor. Fuel capacity can be carried in hardpoint-compatible external <a href="drop%20tank">drop tank</a>s, which give the aircraft a maximum <a href="ferry%20range">ferry range</a> of 2,100 mi (3,300 km) and a <a href="combat%20radius">combat radius</a> of 300 mi (556 km). The AV-8B can also receive additional fuel via <a href="aerial%20refueling">aerial refueling</a> using the probe-and-drogue system. The <a href="British%20Aerospace%20Harrier%20II">British Aerospace Harrier II</a>, a variant tailored to the RAF, uses different avionics, and has one additional missile pylon on each wing.

The Harrier II retains the tandem <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a> layout of the first-generation Harriers, although each <a href="outrigger">outrigger</a> landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when <a href="taxiing">taxiing</a>. The engine intakes are larger than those of the first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On the underside of the fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200 lb (544 kg) of extra lift.

The technological advances incorporated into the Harrier II, compared with the original Harrier, significantly reduce the workload on the pilot. The <a href="supercritical%20wing">supercritical wing</a>, <a href="HOTAS">hands-on-throttle-and-stick</a> (HOTAS) control principle, and increased engineered <a href="wikt%3ALateral%23Adjective">lateral</a> stability make the aircraft fundamentally easier to fly. Ed Harper, general manager for the McDonnell Douglas Harrier II development program, summarized: "The AV-8B looks a lot like the original Harrier and it uses the same operating fundamentals. It just uses them a lot better". A large <a href="cathode-ray%20tube">cathode-ray tube</a> multi-purpose display, taken from the F/A-18, makes up much of the instrument panel in the cockpit. It has a wide range of functions, including radar warning information and weapon delivery checklist. The pilots sit on UPC/Stencel 10B <a href="Ejection%20seat%23Zero-zero%20ejection%20seat">zero-zero ejection seats</a>, meaning that they are able to eject from a stationary aircraft at zero altitude.

For the AV-8B, McDonnell Douglas redesigned the entire airframe of the Harrier, incorporating numerous structural and aerodynamic changes. To improve visibility and better accommodate the crew and avionics hardware, McDonnell Douglas elevated the cockpit by and redesigned the canopy. This improved the forward (17° down), side (60°), and rear visibility. The front fuselage is composed of a molded skin with an <a href="epoxy">epoxy</a>-based core sandwiched between two carbon-fiber sheets. To compensate for the changes in the front fuselage, the rear fuselage was extended by , and the taller vertical stabilizer of the Sea Harrier was used. The tail assembly is made up of composites to reduce weight.

Perhaps the most thorough redesign was of the wing, the objective being to match the performance of the cancelled AV-16 while retaining the Pegasus engine of the AV-8A. Engineers designed a new, one-piece supercritical wing, which improves <a href="Cruise%20%28flight%29">cruise performance</a> by delaying the rise in drag and increasing lift-to-drag ratio. Made of composites, the wing is thicker and has a longer span than that of the AV-8A. Compared to the AV-8A's wing, it has a higher <a href="Aspect%20ratio%20%28wing%29">aspect ratio</a>, reduced <a href="Swept%20wing">sweep</a> (from 40° to 37°), and an area increased from to . The wing has a high-lift configuration, employing <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a> that deploy automatically when maneuvering, and drooped <a href="aileron">aileron</a>s. Using the leading edge root extensions, the new wing allows for a 6,700 lb (3,035 kg) increase in payload compared with the first-generation Harriers after a 1,000 ft (300 m) takeoff roll. Because the wing is almost exclusively composite, it is lighter than the AV-8A's smaller wing.

The Harrier II was the first combat aircraft to extensively employ <a href="Carbon-fiber-reinforced%20polymer">carbon-fiber composite</a> materials, exploiting their light weight and high strength; they are used in the wings, <a href="rudder">rudder</a>, flaps, nose, forward fuselage, and tail. Twenty-six percent of the aircraft's structure is made of composites, reducing its weight by 480 lb (217 kg) compared to a conventional metal structure.

Most of the first "day attack" AV-8B Harrier IIs were upgraded to Night Attack Harrier or Harrier II Plus standards, with the remainder being withdrawn from service. The AV-8B cockpit was also used for the early trialing of <a href="Direct%20Voice%20Input">Direct Voice Input</a> (DVI), which allows the pilot to use voice commands to issue instructions to the aircraft, using a system developed by Smiths Industries. The main attack <a href="avionics">avionics</a> system in original aircraft was the nose-mounted Hughes <a href="AN/ASB-19">AN/ASB-19</a> angle-rate bombing system. The system combined a TV imager and laser tracker to provide a highly accurate targeting capability. Defensive equipment include several AN/ALE-39 <a href="Chaff%20%28countermeasure%29">chaff</a>-<a href="Flare%20%28countermeasure%29">flare</a> dispensers, an <a href="ALR-67%20Radar%20Warning%20Receiver">AN/ALR-67</a> <a href="radar%20warning%20receiver">radar warning receiver</a>, and an <a href="AN/ALQ-126">AN/ALQ-126</a>C <a href="Electronic%20warfare%23Electronic%20warfare%20applications">jammer</a> pod.

The trainer version of the AV-8B is the TAV-8B, seating two pilots in tandem. Among other changes, the forward fuselage features a 3 ft 11 in (1.19 m) extension to accommodate the second cockpit. To compensate for the slight loss of directional stability, the vertical stabilizer's area was enlarged through increases in <a href="Chord%20%28aircraft%29">chord</a> (length of the stabilizer's root) and height. USMC TAV-8Bs feature the AV-8B's digital cockpit and new systems, but have only two hardpoints and are not combat capable. Initial TAV-8Bs were powered by a 21,450 lbf (95.4 kN) F402-RR-406A engine, while later examples were fitted with the 23,000 lbf (105.8 kN) F402-RR-408A. In the early 2000s, 17 TAV-8Bs were upgraded to include a night-attack capability, the F402-RR-408 engine, and software and structural changes.

Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was the first upgrade of the AV-8B. It differed from the original aircraft in having a <a href="forward%20looking%20infrared">forward looking infrared</a> (FLIR) camera added to the top of the nose cone, a wide Smiths Industries <a href="head-up%20display">head-up display</a> (HUD), provisions for <a href="night%20vision%20goggle">night vision goggle</a>s, and a Honeywell digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an <a href="FADEC">electronic control system</a> and was more powerful and reliable. The flare and chaff dispensers were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).

The Harrier II Plus is very similar to the Night Attack variant, with the addition of an <a href="APG-65%20and%20APG-73">APG-65</a> multi-mode <a href="pulse-Doppler%20radar">pulse-Doppler radar</a> in an extended nose, allowing it to launch advanced <a href="beyond-visual-range%20missile">beyond-visual-range missile</a>s such as the AIM-120 AMRAAM. To make additional space for the radar, the angle-rate bombing system was removed. The radars used were taken from early F/A-18 aircraft, which had been upgraded with the related APG-73. In addition to the AIM-120, the AV-8B Plus can also carry <a href="AGM-65%20Maverick">AGM-65 Maverick</a> and <a href="Harpoon%20%28missile%29">AGM-84 Harpoon</a> missiles. According to aviation author Lon Nordeen, the changes "had a slight increase in drag and a bit of additional weight, but there really was not much difference in performance between the [–408-powered] Night Attack and radar Harrier II Plus aircraft".

The AV-8B underwent standard evaluation to prepare for its USMC service. In the operational evaluation (OPEVAL), lasting from 31 August 1984 to 30 March 1985, four pilots and a group of maintenance and support personnel tested the aircraft under combat conditions. The aircraft was graded for its ability to meet its mission requirements for navigating, acquiring targets, delivering weapons, and evading and surviving enemy actions, all at the specified range and payload limits. The first phase of OPEVAL, running until 1 February 1985, required the AV-8B to fly both deep and <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> missions (deep air support missions do not require coordination with friendly ground forces) in concert with other close-support aircraft, as well as flying <a href="Air%20interdiction">battlefield interdiction</a> and armed reconnaissance missions. The aircraft flew from military installations at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Camp%20Pendleton">Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton</a> and <a href="Naval%20Air%20Weapons%20Station%20China%20Lake">Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake</a> in California, <a href="Canadian%20Forces%20Base%20Cold%20Lake">Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake</a> in Canada, and <a href="MCAS%20Yuma">MCAS Yuma</a> in Arizona.

The second phase of OPEVAL, which took place at MCAS Yuma from 25 February to 8 March, required the AV-8B to perform fighter escort, <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a>, and deck-launched intercept missions. Although the evaluation identified shortfalls in the design (subsequently rectified), OPEVAL was deemed successful. The AV-8B Harrier II reached <a href="initial%20operating%20capability">initial operating capability</a> (IOC) in January 1985 with USMC squadron <a href="VMA-331">VMA-331</a>.
The AV-8B saw extensive action in the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> of 1990–91. Aircraft based on and , and at on-shore bases, initially flew training and support <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s, as well as practicing with coalition forces. The AV-8Bs were to be held in reserve during the initial phase of the preparatory air assault of Operation Desert Storm. The AV-8B was first used in the war on the morning of 17 January 1991, when a call for air support from an <a href="North%20American%20Rockwell%20OV-10%20Bronco">OV-10 Bronco</a> <a href="forward%20air%20controller">forward air controller</a> against Iraqi artillery that was shelling <a href="Khafji">Khafji</a> and an adjacent oil refinery, brought the AV-8B into combat. The following day, USMC AV-8Bs attacked Iraqi positions in southern Kuwait. Throughout the war, AV-8Bs performed armed reconnaissance and worked in concert with coalition forces to destroy targets.

During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 86 AV-8Bs amassed 3,380 flights and about 4,100 flight hours, with a mission availability rate of over 90 percent. Five AV-8Bs were lost to enemy <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a>s, and two USMC pilots were killed. The AV-8B had an attrition rate of 1.5 aircraft for every 1,000 sorties flown. <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a> General <a href="Norman%20Schwarzkopf%2C%20Jr.">Norman Schwarzkopf</a> later named the AV-8B among the seven weapons—along with the <a href="Lockheed%20F-117%20Nighthawk">F-117 Nighthawk</a> and <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20AH-64%20Apache">AH-64 Apache</a>—that played a crucial role in the war. In the aftermath of the war, from 27 August 1992, until 2003, USMC AV-8Bs and other aircraft patrolled Iraqi skies in support of <a href="Operation%20Southern%20Watch">Operation Southern Watch</a>. The AV-8Bs launched from <a href="amphibious%20assault%20ship">amphibious assault ship</a>s in the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, and from forward operating bases such as <a href="Ali%20Al%20Salem%20Air%20Base">Ali Al Salem Air Base</a>, Kuwait.

In 1999, the AV-8B participated in <a href="NATO">NATO</a>'s bombing of <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> during <a href="1999%20NATO%20bombing%20of%20Yugoslavia">Operation Allied Force</a>. Twelve Harriers were split evenly between the <a href="24th%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Unit">24th</a> and <a href="26th%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Unit">26th Marine Expeditionary Unit</a>s (MEU). AV-8Bs of the 24th MEU were introduced into combat on 14 April, and over the next 14 days flew 34 combat air support missions over Kosovo. During their six-month deployment aboard USS "Nassau", 24th MEU Harriers averaged a high mission-capable rate of 91.8 percent. On 28 April, the 24th MEU was relieved by the 26th MEU, based on . The first combat sorties of the unit's AV-8Bs occurred two days later, one aircraft being lost. The 26th MEU remained in the theater of operations until 28 May, when it was relocated to <a href="Brindisi">Brindisi</a>, Italy.

USMC AV-8Bs took part in <a href="Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> in Afghanistan from 2001. The USMC <a href="15th%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Unit">15th MEU</a> arrived off the coast of Pakistan in October 2001. Operating from the unit's ships, four AV-8Bs began attack missions into Afghanistan on 3 November 2001. The 26th MEU and its AV-8Bs joined 15th MEU later that month. In December 2001, two AV-8Bs first deployed to a forward base at <a href="Kandahar%20International%20Airport">Kandahar</a> in Afghanistan. More AV-8Bs were deployed with other USMC units to the region in 2002. The <a href="VMA-513">VMA-513</a> squadron deployed six Night Attack AV-8Bs to <a href="Bagram%20Airfield">Bagram</a> in October 2002. These aircraft each carried a <a href="LITENING%20targeting%20pod">LITENING targeting pod</a> to perform reconnaissance missions along with attack and other missions, primarily at night.
The aircraft participated in the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> in 2003, acting primarily in support of USMC ground units. During the initial action, 60 AV-8Bs were deployed on ships such as and , from which over 1,000 sorties were flown throughout the war. When possible, land-based forward arming and refuelling points were set up to enable prompt operations. USMC commander Lieutenant General <a href="Earl%20B.%20Hailston">Earl B. Hailston</a> said that the Harriers were able to provide 24-hour support for ground forces, and noted that "The airplane ... became the envy of pilots even from my background ... there's an awful lot of things on the Harrier that I've found the Hornet pilots asking me [for] ... We couldn't have asked for a better record". 

USMC sources documented the Harrier as holding an 85 percent aircraft <a href="Availability%20%28system%29">availability</a> record in the Iraq War; in just under a month of combat, the aircraft flew over 2,000 sorties. When used, the <a href="LITENING%20targeting%20pod">LITENING II targeting pod</a> achieved greater than 75 percent kill effectiveness on targets. In a single sortie from USS "Bonhomme Richard", a wave of Harriers inflicted heavy damage on a <a href="Republican%20Guard%20%28Iraq%29">Republican Guard</a> tank battalion in advance of a major ground assault on <a href="Al%20Kut">Al Kut</a>. Harriers regularly operated in close support roles for friendly tanks, one of the aircraft generally carrying a LITENING pod. Despite the Harrier's high marks, the limited amount of time that each aircraft could remain on station, around 15–20 minutes, led to some calls from within the USMC for the procurement of <a href="AC-130">AC-130</a> gunships, which could loiter for six hours and had a heavier close air support capability than the AV-8B. AV-8Bs were later used in combination with artillery to provide constant fire support for ground forces during heavy fighting in 2004 around the insurgent stronghold of <a href="Fallujah">Fallujah</a>. The urban environment there required extreme precision for airstrikes.

On 20 March 2011, USMC AV-8Bs were launched from USS "Kearsarge" in support of <a href="Operation%20Odyssey%20Dawn">Operation Odyssey Dawn</a>, enforcing the UN <a href="no-fly%20zone">no-fly zone</a> over Libya. They carried out airstrikes on <a href="Sirte">Sirte</a> on 5 April 2011. Multiple AV-8Bs were involved in the defense of a downed <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15E%20Strike%20Eagle">F-15E</a> pilot, attacking approaching Libyans prior to the pilot's extraction by a <a href="Bell%20Boeing%20V-22%20Osprey">MV-22 Osprey</a>.

In addition to major conflicts, USMC AV-8Bs have been deployed in support of contingency and humanitarian operations, providing fixed-wing air cover and armed reconnaissance. The aircraft served in Somalia throughout the 1990s, Liberia (1990, 1996, and 2003), Rwanda (1994), Central African Republic (1996), Albania (1997), <a href="Zaire">Zaire</a> (1997), and Sierra Leone (1997).
The AV-8B is to be replaced by the F-35B version of the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II">Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II</a>, which was planned to enter service in 2012. The USMC had sought a replacement since the 1980s, and has argued strongly in favor of the development of the F-35B. The Harrier's performance in Iraq, including its ability to use forward operating bases, reinforced the need for a V/STOL aircraft in the USMC arsenal.

In November 2011, the USN purchased the UK's fleet of 72 retired BAe Harrier IIs (63 single-seat GR.7/9/9As plus 9 twin-seat T.12/12As) and replacement engines to provide spares for the existing USMC Harrier II fleet. Although the March 2012 issue of the magazine "<a href="AirForces%20Monthly">AirForces Monthly</a>" stated that the USMC intended to fly some of the ex-British Harrier IIs, instead of using them just for spare parts, the <a href="Naval%20Air%20Systems%20Command">Naval Air Systems Command</a> (NAVAIR) has since stated that the USMC has never had any plans to operate those Harriers.

On 14 September 2012, a <a href="September%202012%20Camp%20Bastion%20raid">Taliban raid</a> destroyed six AV-8Bs and severely damaged two others while they were parked on the tarmac at <a href="Camp%20Bastion">Camp Bastion</a> in Afghanistan's <a href="Helmand%20Province">Helmand Province</a>. All of the aircraft belonged to <a href="VMA-211">VMA-211</a>. The two damaged AV-8Bs were flown out of Afghanistan in the hours after the attack. The attack was described as "the worst loss of U.S. airpower in a single incident since the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>." The lost aircraft were quickly replaced by those from <a href="VMA-231">VMA-231</a>.

On 27 July 2014, USS "Bataan" began deploying USMC AV-8Bs over Iraq to provide surveillance of <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State</a> (IS) forces. Surveillance operations continued after the start of <a href="2014%20military%20intervention%20against%20ISIS">Operation Inherent Resolve</a> against IS militants. In early September 2014, a USMC Harrier from the <a href="22nd%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Unit">22nd MEU</a> struck an IS target near the <a href="Haditha%20Dam">Haditha Dam</a> in Iraq, marking the first time a USMC unit dropped ordnance in the operation. On 1 August 2016, USMC Harriers from began strikes against the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant%20in%20Libya">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya</a> as part of manned and unmanned airstrikes on targets near <a href="Sirte%2C%20Libya">Sirte</a>, launching at least five times within two days.

In the late 1960s, following a demonstration of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier on the <a href="Italian%20Navy">Italian Navy</a> ("Marina Militare") helicopter carrier , the country began investigating the possibility of acquiring the Harrier. Early efforts were hindered by a 1937 Italian law that prohibited the navy from operating <a href="fixed-wing%20aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a> because they were the domain of the air force. In early 1989, the law was changed to allow the navy to operate any fixed-wing aircraft with a maximum weight of over 3,300 lb (1,500 kg). Following a lengthy evaluation of the <a href="British%20Aerospace%20Sea%20Harrier">Sea Harrier</a> and AV-8B, an order was placed for two TAV-8Bs in May 1989. Soon, a contract for a further 16 AV-8B Plus aircraft was signed. After the TAV-8Bs and the first three AV-8Bs, all subsequent Italian Navy Harriers were locally assembled by <a href="Alenia%20Aeronautica">Alenia Aeronautica</a> from kits delivered from the U.S. The two-seaters, the first to be delivered, arrived at Grottaglie in August 1991. They were used for proving flights with the navy's helicopter carriers and on the light aircraft carrier .

In early 1994, the initial batch of US-built aircraft arrived at MCAS Cherry Point for pilot conversion training. The first Italian-assembled Harrier was rolled out the following year. In mid-January 1995, "Giuseppe Garibaldi" set off from <a href="Taranto">Taranto</a> to Somalia with three Harriers on board to maintain stability following the withdrawal of UN forces. The Harriers, flown by five Italian pilots, accumulated more than 100 flight hours and achieved 100 percent availability during the three-month deployment, performing reconnaissance and other missions. The squadron returned to port on 22 March.
In 1999, Italian AV-8Bs were used for the first time in combat missions when they were deployed aboard "Giuseppe Garibaldi", which was participating in Operation Allied Force in <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>. Italian pilots conducted more than 60 sorties alongside other NATO aircraft, attacking the Yugoslav army and paramilitary forces and bombing the country's infrastructure with conventional and <a href="laser-guided%20bomb">laser-guided bomb</a>s (LGB).

In 2000, the Italian Navy was looking to acquire a further seven remanufactured aircraft to equip "Giuseppe Garibaldi" and a new carrier, . Existing aircraft, meanwhile, were updated to allow them to carry AIM-120 AMRAAMs and <a href="JDAM">JDAM</a> guided bombs. From November 2001 to March 2002, eight AV-8Bs were embarked aboard "Giuseppe Garibaldi" and were deployed to the Indian Ocean in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The aircraft, equipped with LGBs, operated throughout January and February 2002, during which 131 missions were logged for a total of 647 flight hours.

In 2011, Italian Harriers, operating from "Giuseppe Garibaldi", worked alongside Italian <a href="Eurofighter">Eurofighter</a>s and aircraft of other nations during <a href="Operation%20Unified%20Protector">Operation Unified Protector</a>, part of the <a href="2011%20military%20intervention%20in%20Libya">2011 military intervention in Libya</a>. They conducted airstrikes as well as intelligence and reconnaissance sorties over Libya, using the LITENING targeting pods while armed with AIM-120 AMRAAMs and <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder">AIM-9 Sidewinder</a>s. In total, Italian military aircraft delivered 710 guided bombs and missiles during sorties: Italian Air Force <a href="Panavia%20Tornado">Tornados</a> and <a href="AMX%20International%20AMX">AMX</a> fighter bombers delivered 550 bombs and missiles, while the eight Italian Navy AV-8Bs flying from "Giuseppe Garibaldi" dropped 160 guided bombs during 1,221 flight hours.

Italian Navy AV-8Bs are slated to be replaced by 15 (originally 22) F-35Bs, which will form the air wing of "Cavour".

Spain, already using the AV-8S Matador, became the first international operator of the AV-8B by signing an order for 12 aircraft in March 1983. Designated VA-2 Matador II by the <a href="Spanish%20Navy">Spanish Navy</a> ("Armada Española"), this variant is known as EAV-8B by McDonnell Douglas. Pilot conversion took place in the US. On 6 October 1987, the first three Matador IIs were delivered to <a href="Naval%20Station%20Rota%2C%20Spain">Naval Station Rota</a>. The new aircraft were painted in a two-tone matt grey finish, similar to US Navy aircraft, and deliveries were complete by 1988.

BAe test pilots cleared the aircraft carrier for Harrier operations in July 1989. The carrier, which replaced the World War II-era , has a 12° <a href="ski-jump%20ramp">ski-jump ramp</a>. It was originally planned that the first unit to operate the aircraft would be the "8 Escuadrilla". This unit was disbanded on 24 October 1986, following the sales of AV-8S Matadors to Thailand. Instead, "9 Escuadrilla" was formed on 29 September 1987, to become part of the Alpha Carrier Air Group and operate the EAV-8B.

In March 1993, under the September 1990 Tripartite MoU between the U.S., Italy, and Spain, eight EAV-8B Plus Matadors were ordered, along with a twin-seat TAV-8B. Deliveries of the Plus-standard aircraft started in 1996. On 11 May 2000, Boeing and the NAVAIR finalized a contract to remanufacture Spanish EAV-8Bs to bring them up to Plus standard. Boeing said the deal required it to remanufacture two EAV-8Bs, with an option for another seven aircraft; other sources say the total was 11 aircraft. The remanufacture allowed the aircraft to carry four AIM-120 AMRAAMs, enhanced the pilot's situational awareness through the installation of new radar and avionics, and provided a new engine. Eventually, five aircraft were modified, the last having been delivered on 5 December 2003.

Spanish EAV-8Bs joined <a href="Operation%20Deny%20Flight">Operation Deny Flight</a>, enforcing the UN's no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Spain did not send its aircraft carrier to participate in the Iraq War in 2003, instead deploying F/A-18s and other aircraft to Turkey to defend that country against potential Iraqi attacks. Starting in 2007, Spain was looking to replace its Harrier IIs–with the likely option being the F-35B. The Spanish government, in May 2014 however, announced that it had decided to extend the aircraft's service life to beyond 2025 due to a lack of funds for a replacement aircraft.

Following the decommissioning of "Príncipe de Asturias" in February 2013, the sole naval platform from which Spanish Harrier IIs can operate is the amphibious assault ship .




During its service with the USMC, the Harrier has had an accident rate three times that of the Corps' F/A-18s. , approximately 110 aircraft have been <a href="Hull%20loss">damaged beyond repair</a> since the type entered service in 1985, the first accident occurring in March that year. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" reported in 2003 that the Harrier family had the highest rate of major accidents among military aircraft in service at that time, with 148 accidents and 45 people killed. Author Lon Nordeen notes that several other USMC single-engine strike aircraft, like the <a href="Douglas%20A-4%20Skyhawk">A-4 Skyhawk</a> and <a href="LTV%20A-7%20Corsair%20II">A-7 Corsair II</a>, had higher accident rates.

Accidents have in particular been connected to the proportionate amount of time the aircraft spends taking off and landing, which are the most critical phases in flight. The AV-8 was dubbed a "<a href="Widow%20maker%20%28disambiguation%29%23Vehicles%20and%20weaponry">widow maker</a>" by some in the military. Further analysis shows that U.S. Marine senior officers never understood the uniqueness of the aircraft. Cutbacks in senior maintenance personnel and pilot mistakes had a disastrous effect on the safety of the American-operated AV-8B and unfairly gained it a negative reputation in the US press.


As part of its 1996 <a href="Pepsi%20Stuff">Pepsi Stuff</a> marketing campaign, Pepsi ran an advertisement promising a Harrier jet to anyone who collected 7,000,000 Pepsi Points, a gag that backfired when a participant attempted to take advantage of the ability to buy additional points for 10 cents each to claim a jet for US$700,000. When Pepsi turned him down, a <a href="Leonard%20v.%20Pepsico%2C%20Inc.">lawsuit ensued</a>, in which the judge ruled that any reasonable person would conclude that the advertisement was a joke.

Saguaro National Park

Saguaro National Park is an American <a href="national%20park">national park</a> in <a href="Pima%20County%2C%20Arizona">Pima County</a>, southeastern <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. The park consists of two separate areas—the Tucson Mountain District (TMD) about west of the city of <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson</a> and the Rincon Mountain District (RMD) about east of the city—that preserve <a href="Sonoran%20Desert">Sonoran Desert</a> landscapes, fauna, and flora, including the giant <a href="saguaro">saguaro</a> cactus.

The volcanic rocks on the surface of the Tucson Mountain District differ greatly from the surface rocks of the Rincon Mountain District; over the past 30 million years, crustal stretching displaced rocks from beneath the <a href="Tucson%20Mountains">Tucson Mountains</a> of the Tucson Mountain District to form the <a href="Rincon%20Mountains">Rincon Mountains</a> of the Rincon Mountain District. Uplifted, domed, and eroded, the Rincon Mountains are significantly higher and wetter than the Tucson Mountains. The Rincons, as one of the <a href="Madrean%20Sky%20Islands">Madrean Sky Islands</a> between the southern Rocky Mountains and the <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20Oriental">Sierra Madre Oriental</a> in Mexico, support high <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> and are home to many plants and animals that do not live in the Tucson Mountain District. 

Earlier residents of and visitors to the lands in and around the park before its creation included the <a href="Hohokam">Hohokam</a>, <a href="Sobaipuri">Sobaipuri</a>, <a href="Tohono%20O%27odham">Tohono O'odham</a>, <a href="Apache">Apache</a>s, Spanish explorers, missionaries, miners, <a href="homesteading">homesteaders</a>, and ranchers. In 1933, President <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>, using the power of the <a href="Antiquities%20Act">Antiquities Act</a>, established the original park, Saguaro National Monument, in the Rincon Mountains. In 1961, President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> added the Tucson Mountain District to the monument and renamed the original tract the Rincon Mountain District. <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> combined the Tucson Mountain District and the Rincon Mountain District to form the national park in 1994.

Popular activities in the park include hiking on its of trails and sightseeing along paved roads near its two visitor centers. Both districts allow bicycling and horseback riding on selected roads and trails. The Rincon Mountain District offers limited wilderness camping, but there is no overnight camping in the Tucson Mountain District.

The park gets its name from the <a href="saguaro">saguaro</a> ("Carnegiea gigantea"), a large <a href="cactus">cactus</a> that is native to the Sonoran Desert and that does not grow naturally elsewhere. "Rincón"—as in <a href="Rincon%20Mountains">Rincon Mountains</a>, Rincon Creek, and Rincon Valley—is <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> for "corner", and refers to the shape of the mountain range and its footprint. The name "Tucson" derives from <a href="O%27odham%20language">Papago-Piman</a> words "cuk ṣon" [ˡtʃukʂɔn], meaning "dark spring" or "brown spring". "Tank" or "Tanque" refers to a small artificial pool behind a dam that traps <a href="Surface%20runoff">runoff</a> in an existing natural depression. "Madrean" derives from "Madre" in Sierra Madre (Mother Mountains).

The park consists of two separate parcels, the Tucson Mountain District (TMD) to the west of <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson, Arizona</a>, and the Rincon Mountain District (RMD) to the east. Each parcel comes within about of the center of the city. Their total combined area in 2016 was . The Tucson Mountain District covers about , while the much larger Rincon Mountain District accounts for the balance of about . About of the park, including large fractions of both districts, is designated <a href="National%20Wilderness%20Preservation%20System">wilderness</a>.

<a href="Interstate%2010%20in%20Arizona">Interstate 10</a>, the major highway nearest to the park, passes through Tucson. Tucson Mountain Park abuts the south side of the Tucson Mountain District, and to its west lies the <a href="Avra%20Valley">Avra Valley</a>. The Rincon Mountain Wilderness, a separate protected area of about in the <a href="Coronado%20National%20Forest">Coronado National Forest</a>, abuts the Rincon Mountain District on the east and southeast, while the Rincon Valley lies immediately south of the western part of the Rincon Mountain District. 

Both districts conserve tracts of the <a href="Sonoran%20Desert">Sonoran Desert</a>, including ranges of significant hills, the <a href="Tucson%20Mountains">Tucson Mountains</a> in the west and the Rincon Mountains in the east. Elevations in the Tucson Mountain District range from , the summit of Wasson Peak. The Tucson Mountain District receives an average of about of precipitation a year. Elevations within the Rincon Mountain District vary from at the summit of Mica Mountain, where annual rain and snow totals average . Precipitation in both districts falls mainly during two brief seasons, in December and January as steady light rains and in July and August as brief violent rains accompanied by lightning and sometimes by <a href="dust%20storm">dust storm</a>s and <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>s. Some moisture at the highest elevations in the Rincons falls as snow in winter; snowmelt adds to the limited water available at lower elevations later in the year. 

Between October and April, daytime temperatures reach , and nighttime temperatures may drop below freezing. During the warmest season, May through September, daily high temperatures average more than . Studies of the effects of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> on the park show that its annual mean temperature rose from about in 1900 to about in 2010.

Saguaro National Park lies within the watershed of the north-flowing <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20River%20%28Arizona%29">Santa Cruz River</a>, which is generally dry. Rincon Creek in the southern part of the Rincon Mountain District, free-flowing for at least part of the year, has the largest <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian zone</a> in the park. The creek is a tributary of <a href="Ci%C3%A9nega%20Creek">Pantano Wash</a>, which crosses Tucson from southeast to northwest to meet Tanque Verde Wash. The two washes form the <a href="Rillito%20River%20Park">Rillito River</a>, another dry wash, an east–west tributary of the Santa Cruz River. The washes in both districts are usually dry but are subject at times to flash floods. Smaller riparian zones are found near <a href="spring%20%28hydrology%29">springs</a> and <a href="tinaja">tinaja</a>s in the Rincon Mountain District. The largest of the springs is at Manning Camp, high in the Rincons.

Saguaro National Park's oldest rocks, the <a href="Pinal%20Schist">Pinal Schist</a>, pre-date the formation of the contemporary <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range Province</a>, of which the park is a part, by about 1.7 billion years. The <a href="schist">schist</a> is exposed in the Rincon Mountain District along a <a href="Arroyo%20%28creek%29">dry wash</a> off Cactus Forest Loop Drive. Other ancient rocks, 1.4-billion-year-old altered <a href="granite">granite</a>s, form much of Tanque Verde Ridge in the Rincon Mountain District.

Much later, about 600 million years ago, shallow seas covered the region around present-day Tucson; over time that led to deposition of <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s—<a href="limestone">limestone</a>s, <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>s, and <a href="shale">shale</a>s. Limestone, which occurs in the park in several places, was mined here in the late 19th century to make <a href="Mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a>. The future park land had six <a href="lime%20kiln">lime kiln</a>s, two in the Tucson Mountain District, and four in the Rincon Mountain District. Three, all in the Rincon Mountain District, can be visited today—two along the Cactus Forest Trail and one along the Ruiz Trail. 

About 80 million years ago <a href="tectonic%20plate">tectonic plate</a> movements induced a period of mountain building, the <a href="Laramide%20orogeny">Laramide orogeny</a>, which lasted until about 50 million years ago in western North America. Explosive volcanic eruptions formed the Tucson Mountains about 70 million years ago, and the roof of the volcano at their center collapsed to form a <a href="caldera">caldera</a> across. The caldera was eventually filled by debris flows, the intrusion of a granitic <a href="pluton">pluton</a>, and lava flows, some as recent as 30 to 15 million years ago. Volcanic rocks exposed in and near the Tucson Mountain District are remnants of these events. Examples include large <a href="breccia">breccia</a> exposed at Grants Pass and a granitic remnant of the <a href="magma%20chamber">magma chamber</a>, which is visible from the Sus Picnic Area in the Tucson Mountain District. Not all of the molten granite reached the surface of the Tucson Mountains; some cooled and crystallized far below. 

The Tucson Basin and nearby mountains—including the Tucson Mountains to the west, the <a href="Santa%20Catalina%20Mountains">Santa Catalinas</a> to the north, and the Rincons to the east—are part of the Basin and Range Province extending from northern Mexico to southern <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> in the United States. The province, of relatively recent geologic origin, formed when plate movements stretched and thinned the Earth's crust in this part of western North America until the crust pulled apart along <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">faults</a>. The Catalina Fault, a low-angle <a href="detachment%20fault">detachment fault</a>, began to form about 30 million years ago about below the surface of the Tucson Mountains. The rocks under the fault, the lower-plate rocks, were eventually displaced east-northeast relative to the rocks above the fault, then uplifted, domed, and eroded to form the Santa Catalina and Rincon mountains visible today. Although the volcanic rocks seen on the surface of the Tucson Mountain District are not found in the Rincon Mountain District, the crystallized granite (Catalina <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a>) from beneath the Tucson Mountains was eventually exposed on the Rincon Mountain District's surface. The most common rock type in the Rincon Mountains, this banded gneiss is visible in the Rincon Mountain District at sites such as Javelina Rocks along the Cactus Forest Loop Drive.

The earliest known residents of the land in and around what later became Saguaro National Park were the <a href="Hohokam">Hohokam</a>, who lived there in villages between 200 and 1450 A.D. <a href="Petroglyph">Petroglyph</a>s and bits of broken pottery are among Hohokam artifacts found in the park. The Hohokam hunted deer and other animals, gathered <a href="Cylindropuntia">cholla</a> buds, <a href="Opuntia">prickly pears</a>, <a href="Parkinsonia">palo verde</a> pods, and saguaro fruit, and grew corn, beans, and squash. Subsequent indigenous cultures, the <a href="Sobaipuri">Sobaipuri</a> of the Tucson Basin and the <a href="Tohono%20O%27odham">Tohono O'odham</a> to the west, may be descendants of the Hohokam, though the evidence is inconclusive. 

Spanish explorers first entered Arizona in 1539–40. Non-native settlement of the region near the park did not occur until 1692 with the founding of <a href="Mission%20San%20Xavier%20del%20Bac">San Xavier Mission</a> along the Santa Cruz River, which flowed through Tucson. In 1775, the Spaniards built <a href="Presidio%20San%20Agust%C3%ADn%20del%20Tucs%C3%B3n">Presidio San Agustín del Tucsón</a>, a military fort in what was then part of <a href="New%20Spain">New Spain</a>, in part to protect against raids by <a href="Apache">Apache</a>s.

The lands that eventually would become Saguaro National Park remained relatively free of development until the mid-19th century, after Arizona had become part of the United States. After passage of the <a href="Homestead%20Acts">Homestead Act of 1862</a>, the arrival of the railroad in 1880, and the end of the <a href="Apache%20Wars">Apache Wars</a> in 1886, <a href="homesteading">homesteaders</a> and ranchers established themselves in the Tucson and Rincon Mountains, and miners sought silver, copper, and other valuable <a href="ore">ore</a>s and minerals. Mining in the park continued intermittently through 1942, while ranching on private in-holdings within the park continued until the mid-1970s. 

The defunct Loma Verde Mine, which is still visible in the Rincon Mountain District, produced a small amount of copper and gold between 1897 and 1907. Mining of <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous rock</a> at 149 sites in the Tucson Mountain District sometimes produced ores of modest value in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most successful, the Copper King Mine (later renamed the Mile Wide Mine), yielded 34,000 tons of copper, gold, lead, zinc, and <a href="molybdenum">molybdenum</a> ores, mostly during the war years of 1917, 1918, and 1941; it closed permanently in 1942 when it became unprofitable.

Ranchers grazed thousands of cattle on public land that would later become part of the park, and homesteaders farmed and ranched at the base of the Rincons, filing homestead applications from the 1890s through 1930. The remains of the former Freeman Homestead, established in 1929, lie along a nature trail in the Rincon Mountain District. The homestead is on the Arizona State Register of Historic Places. Manning Cabin, built in 1905 as a summer retreat for <a href="Levi%20Manning">Levi Manning</a>, a wealthy businessman and one-term mayor of Tucson, is part of the infrastructure at Manning Camp near Mica Mountain. Modified and restored after falling into disrepair, it was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1975. Cultural resources in the park include more than 450 archeological sites and more than 60 historic structures.

In 1920 members of the Natural History Society of the <a href="University%20of%20Arizona">University of Arizona</a> expressed interest in establishing a protected area for saguaro, a cactus species familiar to watchers of silent-movie <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Westerns</a>. In 1928 <a href="Homer%20L.%20Shantz">Homer L. Shantz</a>, a plant scientist and the university's president, joined the efforts to create a saguaro sanctuary, but issues related to funding and management delayed the creation of a park. In 1933 <a href="Frank%20Harris%20Hitchcock">Frank Harris Hitchcock</a>, publisher of the "<a href="Tucson%20Citizen">Tucson Citizen</a>" and a former <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">United States Postmaster General</a> who was influential in the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>, persuaded U.S. President <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> to create Saguaro National Monument. Hoover used his power under the <a href="Antiquities%20Act%20of%201906">Antiquities Act of 1906</a> to create the monument by proclamation on March 1, 1933. Later that year President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> transferred management of the monument, east of Tucson in the Rincon Mountains, to the National Park Service. Between 1936 and 1939, during the Roosevelt administration, the <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> (CCC) built the monument's Cactus Forest Loop Drive and related infrastructure. The monument's visitor center opened in the 1950s.

In 1961 President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>—encouraged by <a href="Stewart%20Udall">Stewart Udall</a>, an Arizonan who was then <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a>—added of cactus lands in the Tucson Mountains to the monument. This western district of the monument was carved from Tucson Mountain Park, managed by <a href="Pima%20County%2C%20Arizona">Pima County</a>. In the 1920s, the Tucson Game Protective Association had persuaded the Department of the Interior to withdraw about in the Tucson Mountains from homesteading and mining and to set it aside as a park and game refuge. Land leased by the county in this set-aside became the Tucson Mountain Recreation Area in 1932. Between 1933 and 1941 CCC workers built structures at eight picnic areas in the county-park portion of the set-aside, five of which later became part of the Tucson Mountain District of the national monument. Their other projects involved road- and trail-building, landscaping, erosion control, and enhancing water supplies for wildlife. Kennedy's 1961 proclamation created the Tucson Mountain District from the northern part of the county park and renamed the original monument lands east of Tucson the Rincon Mountain District. Expansions in 1976 and 1994 brought the total Tucson Mountain District area to . In 1994 <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> elevated the combined Tucson Mountain District and Rincon Mountain District to National Park status.

Plant communities within the park vary with elevation. The Tucson Mountain District has two distinct communities, <a href="Deserts%20and%20xeric%20shrublands">desert scrub</a>—such as <a href="Atriplex%20canescens">fourwing saltbush</a> and <a href="Encelia%20farinosa">brittlebrush</a>—at the lowest elevations, and desert grassland a little higher. The Rincon Mountain District includes these two communities as well as four more at higher elevations, oak woodland, pine–oak woodland, pine forest and, high in the Rincons, <a href="Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forest">mixed conifer forest</a>—<a href="Pseudotsuga%20menziesii%20var.%20glauca">Douglas-fir</a>, <a href="Pinus%20ponderosa">Ponderosa pine</a>, <a href="Abies%20concolor">white fir</a>, <a href="Quercus%20gambelii">Gambel oak</a>, and many other trees, shrubs, and <a href="understory">understory</a> plants. During annual inventories in 2011 and 2013, hundreds of scientists and thousands of volunteers identified 389 species of <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a>s, 25 of <a href="non-vascular%20plant">non-vascular plant</a>s, and 197 species of <a href="Fungus">fungi</a> in Saguaro National Park.

Saguaros, which flourish in both districts of the park, grow at an exceptionally slow rate. The first arm of a saguaro typically appears when the cactus is between 50 and 70 years old though it may be closer to 100 years in places where precipitation is very low. Saguaros may live as long as 200 years and are considered mature at about age 125. A mature saguaro may grow up to tall and weigh up to when fully hydrated. The total number of saguaros in the park is estimated at 1.8 million, and 24 other species of cactus are abundant. The most common of these are the <a href="Ferocactus%20wislizeni">fishhook barrel</a>, <a href="Cylindropuntia%20echinocarpa">staghorn cholla</a>, <a href="Echinocereus%20fendleri">pinkflower hedgehog</a>, <a href="Opuntia%20engelmannii">Engelman's prickly pear</a>, <a href="Cylindropuntia%20bigelovii">teddybear cholla</a>, and <a href="Cylindropuntia%20fulgida">jumping cholla</a>.

Invasive plants include <a href="Pennisetum">fountain grass</a>, <a href="Tamarix">tamarisk</a>, <a href="Centaurea%20melitensis">Malta starthistle</a>, and many others, but by far the most severe threat to the native ecosystem is <a href="Cenchrus%20ciliaris">buffelgrass</a>. This drought-tolerant plant, native to parts of Africa and Asia, was imported to the United States in the 1930s and planted near Tucson and elsewhere to create cattle forage and to control erosion. First detected in the park in 1989, it has dispersed widely in both districts. Competing with other plants for sustenance, buffelgrass fills the empty spaces normally found between native desert plants and creates a significant fire hazard. The <a href="noxious%20weed">noxious weed</a>, considered impossible to completely eliminate, is managed in some areas of the park and in Tucson residential zones by hand-pulling and, during periods of wet weather, application of <a href="glyphosate">glyphosate</a>-based herbicides.

An inventory of medium and large mammals in the park confirmed the presence of 30 species in Saguaro National Park between 1999 and 2008. Of these, 21 were found in the Tucson Mountain District and 29 in the Rincon Mountain District. A partial list of the park's mammals includes <a href="North%20American%20cougar">cougars</a>, <a href="Mearns%20coyote">coyotes</a>, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s, <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a>, <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a>, <a href="peccary">javelinas</a>, <a href="gray%20fox">gray fox</a>es, <a href="black-tailed%20jackrabbit">black-tailed jackrabbit</a>s, <a href="desert%20cottontail">desert cottontail</a>s, <a href="ring-tailed%20cat">ring-tailed cat</a>s, <a href="white-nosed%20coati">white-nosed coati</a>s, <a href="ground%20squirrel">ground squirrel</a>s, and <a href="white-throated%20woodrat">packrats</a>. One <a href="Endangered%20species%23Endangered%20Species%20Act">endangered</a> mammal, the <a href="lesser%20long-nosed%20bat">lesser long-nosed bat</a>, lives part of the year in the park and part of the year in Mexico. 
The wide range of habitats in the park supports a diverse population of birds including some, such as the <a href="vermilion%20flycatcher">vermilion flycatcher</a> and the <a href="whiskered%20screech%20owl">whiskered screech owl</a>, uncommon elsewhere in the United States. Among the park's 107 bird species are <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a>s, <a href="cactus%20wren">cactus wren</a>s, <a href="common%20raven">ravens</a>, <a href="American%20kestrel">kestrels</a>, <a href="turkey%20vulture">turkey vulture</a>s, <a href="Greater%20roadrunner">roadrunners</a>, <a href="Gila%20woodpecker">woodpeckers</a>, <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">hawks</a>, <a href="quail">quail</a>s, and <a href="broad-billed%20hummingbird">hummingbirds</a>, and one threatened species, the <a href="Mexican%20spotted%20owl">Mexican spotted owl</a>.

The park's 36 reptile species include <a href="desert%20tortoise">desert tortoise</a>s, <a href="Western%20diamondback%20rattlesnake">diamondback rattlesnakes</a> (one of the more commonly seen snakes), <a href="Micruroides">coral snakes</a>, <a href="Gila%20monster">Gila monster</a>s, <a href="Greater%20short-horned%20lizard">short-horned lizards</a>, <a href="Sceloporus%20magister">spiny lizards</a>, and <a href="zebra-tailed%20lizard">zebra-tailed lizard</a>s. Despite the aridity, three <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a> species inhabit the park: the <a href="canyon%20tree%20frog">canyon tree frog</a>, the <a href="lowland%20leopard%20frog">lowland leopard frog</a>, and <a href="Couch%27s%20spadefoot%20toad">Couch's spadefoot</a>, which lives in underground burrows, emerging to breed during summer rains. Forest fires, which create erosion-prone burned areas, have destroyed many of the leopard frog's breeding pools, which fill with sediment. The <a href="Arizona%20Game%20and%20Fish%20Department">Arizona Game and Fish Department</a> lists the lowland leopard frog as a species of special concern.

Urban sprawl, air and water pollution, noise, <a href="light%20pollution">light pollution</a>, and a range of habitat restricted by human infrastructure put stress on the park's mammals and other animals, but the most serious immediate threat to them is <a href="roadkill">roadkill</a>. About 50,000 <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s a year die on the park's roads when they are hit by a vehicle. The Rincon Mountain District has few roads, but Picture Rocks Road, an east–west commuter highway crossing the Tucson Mountain District, is highly dangerous to wildlife. Attempts in 2002 to convert it to a hiking trail failed after the proposal met with stiff public resistance.

The Rincons and the nearby Santa Catalinas (but not the shorter Tucson Mountains) are among about 40 mountain ranges known as the <a href="Madrean%20Sky%20Islands">Madrean Sky Islands</a> that are of special interest to biologists. These ranges, resembling a series of stepping stones between the southern end of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>—specifically the <a href="Mogollon%20Rim">Mogollon Rim</a> of the <a href="Colorado%20Plateau">Colorado Plateau</a>—in the United States and the <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20Occidental">Sierra Madre Occidental</a> in Mexico, are continental "islands" separated from one another by "seas" of lower-elevation valleys that impede but do not completely block <a href="species">species</a> migration from one <a href="sky%20island">sky island</a> to another. Ecologist <a href="Peter%20Warshall">Peter Warshall</a> lists several characteristics that make the Madrean complex unique among Earth's 20 or so sky-island complexes. Among these are its north–south orientation across eight degrees of <a href="latitude">latitude</a> spanning zones from the temperate to the subtropical, the highly varied nature of its geologic origin and of its soils, the moderate to high <a href="Terrain%23Relief">relief</a> of its terrain, and its safe distance from the <a href="Extinction%20event">mass extinctions</a> related to the northern <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s of the most recent <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">Ice Age</a>. Influenced by these and other conditions, the Madrean Sky Islands support unusual <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>.

The park is generally open to hikers all day every day except Christmas; the Tucson Mountain District is open to vehicle traffic from sunrise to sunset and the Rincon Mountain District from 7 a.m. to sunset. Both districts have visitor centers. More than of hiking trails wind through the park, where perils may include extreme heat, dehydration, flash floods, cactus spines, snakes, cougars, bears, and <a href="Africanized%20bee">Africanized bee</a>s. The Rincon Mountain District is open to wilderness camping, which requires a permit, but no overnight camping is permitted in the Tucson Mountain District.

The Tucson Mountain District has of paved roads and of unpaved roads, including the Bajada Loop Drive. Bicycling is allowed only on paved roads, as well as Bajada Loop Drive, Golden Gate Road, and the Belmont multi-use trail. Horses and other livestock are allowed on some of the trails. 

Hohokam petroglyphs etched into large stones are easily accessible in the Tucson Mountain District. The Signal Hill Trail, which begins at the Signal Hill Picnic Area along the Bajada Loop Drive, leads to an area with dozens of examples of the 800-year-old rock art.

Among the notable artificial structures in the Tucson Mountain District are <a href="Ramada%20%28shelter%29">ramadas</a>, picnic tables, and restrooms built by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1933 and 1941. Designed to conform to their natural surrounds, the rustic buildings consist mainly of quarried stone and other materials native to the area.

The <a href="Arizona-Sonora%20Desert%20Museum">Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum</a> lies just south of the Tucson Mountain District along North Kinney Road in Tucson Mountain County Park. The non-profit organization, operating on rented from Pima County, combines aspects of a <a href="botanical%20garden">botanical garden</a>, zoo, and <a href="natural%20history%20museum">natural history museum</a> featuring the plants and animals native to the region.

The Rincon Mountain District features the Cactus Forest Loop Drive, which provides access to some of the trails. Angling across the Rincon Mountain District from southwest to northeast is a segment of the <a href="Arizona%20Trail">Arizona Trail</a>. The trail crosses Arizona from its border with <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> on the south to its border with <a href="Utah">Utah</a> on the north. In 2009, Congress named it a <a href="National%20Scenic%20Trail">National Scenic Trail</a>.

Horseback riding is allowed on some of the trails. Livestock—defined by the NPS as horses, mules, or <a href="burro">burro</a>s—must carry their own food and are not allowed to graze in the park. Bicycling is allowed on the Cactus Forest Loop Drive and two park trails.

Manning Camp Campground is the main staging area for firefighters, trail-maintenance crews, and scientists working in the Rincon Mountain District. Their supplies are brought in by pack <a href="mule">mule</a>s that are kept in corrals at the site. Runoff from a nearby spring, the largest in Rincons, provides water for the livestock.

On a plot adjacent to the Rincon Mountain District along Broadway, the Desert Research Learning Center (DRLC) supports scientific and educational projects related to a network of Sonoran Desert parks, including Saguaro National Park. The DRLC grounds, which include desert plants, an artificial tinaja, and a rainwater collection system, are open to the public. The Sonoran Desert Inventory and Monitoring Network of which the DRLC is part, covers 10 national monuments or parks in Arizona and 1 in New Mexico.

Imagine (John Lennon song)

"Imagine" is a song co-written and performed by English musician <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>. The best-selling single of his solo career, its lyrics encourage the listener to imagine a world at peace without the barriers of borders or the divisions of religion and nationality and to consider the possibility that the whole of humanity would live unattached to material possessions. Shortly before his death, Lennon said that much of the song's "lyric and content" came from his wife <a href="Yoko%20Ono">Yoko Ono</a>, and in 2017, she received a co-writing credit.

Lennon and Ono co-produced the song and <a href="Imagine%20%28John%20Lennon%20album%29">album of the same name</a> with <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a>. Recording began at Lennon's home studio at <a href="Tittenhurst%20Park">Tittenhurst Park</a>, England, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the <a href="Record%20Plant">Record Plant</a>, in New York City, during July. One month after the September release of the LP, Lennon released "Imagine" as a single in the United States; the song peaked at number three on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> and the LP reached number one on the UK chart in November, later becoming the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career. Although not originally released as a single in the United Kingdom, it was released in 1975 to promote a compilation LP and it reached number six on the chart that year. The song has since sold more than 1.6 million copies in the UK; it reached number one following <a href="Murder%20of%20John%20Lennon">Lennon's murder</a> in December 1980. In 1985, the <a href="Central%20Park%20Conservancy">Central Park Conservancy</a> memorialised a portion of the park in honour of Lennon, called <a href="Strawberry%20Fields%20%28memorial%29">Strawberry Fields</a>, with a mosaic that reads "Imagine".

<a href="Broadcast%20Music%2C%20Inc.">BMI</a> named "Imagine" one of the 100 most-performed songs of the 20th century. The song ranked number 30 on the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>'s list of the 365 <a href="Songs%20of%20the%20Century">Songs of the Century</a> bearing the most historical significance. It earned a <a href="Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Award">Grammy Hall of Fame Award</a> and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's <a href="500%20Songs%20that%20Shaped%20Rock%20and%20Roll">500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll</a>. A UK survey conducted by the "<a href="British%20Hit%20Singles%20%26amp%3B%20Albums">Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book</a>" named it the second best single of all time, while "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" ranked it number three in their list of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>". Since 2005, event organisers have played it just before the New Year's <a href="Times%20Square%20Ball">Times Square Ball</a> drops in New York City. Dozens of artists have <a href="cover%20version">performed or recorded</a> versions of "Imagine", including <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>, <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>, <a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a>, <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a>, <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> and <a href="Diana%20Ross">Diana Ross</a>. <a href="Emeli%20Sand%C3%A9">Emeli Sandé</a> recorded a cover for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> to use during the end credits montage at the close of the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a> coverage in August 2012. "Imagine" subsequently re-entered the UK Top 40, reaching number 18.

Several poems from <a href="Yoko%20Ono">Yoko Ono</a>'s 1964 book "<a href="Grapefruit%20%28book%29">Grapefruit</a>" inspired Lennon to write the lyrics for "Imagine" – in particular, one which <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a> reproduced on the back cover of the original "<a href="Imagine%20%28John%20Lennon%20album%29">Imagine</a>" LP titled "Cloud Piece", reads: "Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in." Lennon later said the composition "should be credited as a Lennon/Ono song. A lot of it – the lyric and the concept – came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more macho, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of "Grapefruit"." When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with <a href="David%20Sheff">David Sheff</a> for "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" magazine, Lennon told Sheff that <a href="Dick%20Gregory">Dick Gregory</a> had given Ono and him a <a href="Christian%20prayer">Christian prayer</a> book, which inspired him the concept behind "Imagine".

With the combined influence of "Cloud Piece" and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as "a humanistic <a href="paean">paean</a> for the people". Blaney wrote, "Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential." "Rolling Stone"s <a href="David%20Fricke">David Fricke</a> commented: "[Lennon] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [and] economic class."

Lennon stated: "'Imagine', which says: 'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,' is virtually the Communist Manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement." He told "<a href="NME">NME</a>": "There is no real Communist state in the world; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about ... [is] not the way some daft Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice ... British Socialism." Ono described the lyrical statement of "Imagine" as "just what John believed: that we are all one country, one world, one people." "Rolling Stone" described its lyrics as "22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself". Atheist author <a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> embraced it as an "atheist anthem". Lennon himself stated that his song "did not discourage faith".

Lennon composed "Imagine" one morning in early 1971, on a <a href="Steinway%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Steinway</a> piano, in a bedroom at his <a href="Tittenhurst%20Park">Tittenhurst Park</a> estate in <a href="Ascot%2C%20Berkshire">Ascot, Berkshire</a>, England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session. Described as a <a href="Ballad">piano ballad</a> performed in the <a href="soft%20rock">soft rock</a> genre, the song is in the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="C%20major">C major</a>. Its 4-bar piano introduction begins with a C chord then moves to Cmaj7 before changing to F; the 12-bar verses also follow this chord progression, with their last 4 bars moving from Am/E to Dm and Dm/C, finishing with G, G11 then G7, before resolving back to C. The 8-bar choruses progress from F to G to C, then Cmaj7 and E before ending on E7, a C chord substituted for E7 in the final bar. The 4-bar <a href="Conclusion%20%28music%29">outro</a> begins with F, then G, before resolving on C. With a duration of 3 minutes and 3 seconds and a <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a> of 4/4, the song's tempo falls around 75 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>.

Lennon and Ono co-produced the song and album with <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a>, who commented on the track: "We knew what we were going to do ... It was going to be John making a political statement, but a very commercial one as well ... I always thought that 'Imagine' was like the national anthem." Lennon described his working arrangement with Ono and Spector: "Phil doesn't arrange or anything like that—[Ono] and Phil will just sit in the other room and shout comments like, 'Why don't you try this sound' or 'You're not playing the piano too well' ... I'll get the initial idea and ... we'll just find a sound from [there]."

Recording took place on 27 May 1971 at <a href="Ascot%20Sound%20Studios">Ascot Sound Studios</a>, Lennon's newly built home studio at Tittenhurst Park, with string overdubs taking place on 4 July 1971 at the <a href="Record%20Plant">Record Plant</a>, in New York City. Relaxed and patient, the sessions began during the late morning, running to just before dinner in the early evening. Lennon taught the musicians the chord progression and a working arrangement for "Imagine", rehearsing the song until he deemed the musicians ready to record. In his attempt to recreate Lennon's desired sound, Spector had some early tapings feature Lennon and <a href="Nicky%20Hopkins">Nicky Hopkins</a> playing in different octaves on one piano. He also initially attempted to record the piano part with Lennon playing the white <a href="Grand%20piano">baby grand</a> in the couple's all-white room. However, after having deemed the room's acoustics unsuitable, Spector abandoned the idea in favour of the superior environment of Lennon's home studio. They completed the session in minutes, recording three takes and choosing the second one for release. The finished recording featured Lennon on piano and vocal, <a href="Klaus%20Voormann">Klaus Voormann</a> on bass guitar, <a href="Alan%20White%20%28Yes%20drummer%29">Alan White</a> on drums and the Flux Fiddlers on strings.

Issued by <a href="Apple%20Records">Apple Records</a> in the United States in October 1971, "Imagine" became the best-selling single of Lennon's solo career. It peaked at number three on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> and reached number one in Canada on the "<a href="RPM%20%28magazine%29">RPM</a>" national singles chart, remaining there for two weeks. Upon its release the song's lyrics upset some religious groups, particularly the line: "Imagine there's no heaven". When asked about the song during one of his final interviews, Lennon said he considered it to be as strong a composition as any he had written with <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>. He described the song's meaning and explicated its commercial appeal: "Anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalistic, but because it is sugarcoated it is accepted ... Now I understand what you have to do. Put your political message across with a little honey." In an <a href="open%20letter">open letter</a> to <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> published in "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>", Lennon said that "Imagine" was "'<a href="Working%20Class%20Hero">Working Class Hero</a>' with sugar on it for conservatives like yourself". On 30 November 1971, the "Imagine" LP reached number one on the UK chart. It became the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career.

In 1972, Lennon and Ono released an 81-minute <a href="Imagine%20%281972%20film%29">film</a> to accompany the "Imagine" album which featured footage of the couple in their home, garden and the recording studio of their <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a> property at Tittenhurst Park as well as in New York City. A full-length documentary rock video, the film's first scene features a shot of Lennon and Ono walking through a thick fog, arriving at their house as the song "Imagine" begins. Above the front door to their house is a sign that reads: "This Is Not Here", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit, all-white room. Ono gradually walks around opening curtains that allow in light, making the room brighter with the song's progression. At the song's conclusion, Ono sits beside Lennon at the piano, and they share a quaint gaze, then a brief kiss.

Several celebrities appeared in the film, including <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>, <a href="Fred%20Astaire">Fred Astaire</a>, <a href="Jack%20Palance">Jack Palance</a>, <a href="Dick%20Cavett">Dick Cavett</a> and <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>. Derided by critics as "the most expensive home movie of all time", it premiered to an American audience in 1972. In 1986, <a href="Zbigniew%20Rybczy%C5%84ski">Zbigniew Rybczyński</a> made a <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for the song, and in 1987, it won both the "<a href="Cannes%20Lions%20International%20Festival%20of%20Creativity">Silver Lion</a>" award for Best Clip at <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes</a> and the Festival Award at the <a href="Festival%20do%20Rio">Rio International Film Festival</a>.

Released as a single in the United Kingdom in 1975 in conjunction with the album "<a href="Shaved%20Fish">Shaved Fish</a>", "Imagine" peaked at number six on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. Following <a href="Death%20of%20John%20Lennon">Lennon's murder</a> in 1980, the single re-entered the UK chart, reaching number one, where it remained for four weeks in January 1981. "Imagine" was re-released as a single in the UK in 1988, peaking at number 45, and again in 1999, reaching number three. It has sold 1,640,000 copies in the UK as of June 2013, making it Lennon's best-selling single. In 1999, on National Poetry Day in the United Kingdom, the BBC announced that listeners had voted "Imagine" Britain's favourite song lyric. In 2003, it reached number 33 as the B-side to a re-release of "<a href="Happy%20Xmas%20%28War%20Is%20Over%29">Happy Xmas (War Is Over)</a>".

"Rolling Stone" described "Imagine" as Lennon's "greatest musical gift to the world", praising "the serene melody; the pillowy chord progression; [and] that beckoning, four-note [piano] figure". <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> called it "both a hymn for <a href="Opposition%20to%20United%20States%20involvement%20in%20the%20Vietnam%20War">the Movement</a> and a love song for his wife, celebrating a Yokoism and a <a href="Herbert%20Marcuse">Marcusianism</a> simultaneously". Included in several song polls, in 1999, <a href="Broadcast%20Music%2C%20Inc.">BMI</a> named it one of the top 100 most-performed songs of the 20th century. Also that year, <a href="List%20of%20Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Award%20recipients%20%28E%E2%80%93I%29">it received</a> the <a href="Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Award">Grammy Hall of Fame Award</a> and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's <a href="500%20Songs%20that%20Shaped%20Rock%20and%20Roll">500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll</a>. "Imagine" ranked number 23 in the list of best-selling singles of all time in the UK, in 2000. In 2002, a UK survey conducted by the "<a href="British%20Hit%20Singles%20%26amp%3B%20Albums">Guinness World Records British Hit Singles Book</a>" ranked it the second best single of all time behind <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a>'s "<a href="Bohemian%20Rhapsody">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>". <a href="Gold%20%28radio%29">Gold Radio</a> ranked the song number three on its "Gold's greatest 1000 hits" list.

"Rolling Stone" ranked "Imagine" number three on its list of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>", describing it as "an enduring hymn of solace and promise that has carried us through extreme grief, from the shock of Lennon's own death in 1980 to the unspeakable horror of <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11th</a>. It is now impossible to imagine a world without 'Imagine', and we need it more than he ever dreamed." Despite that sentiment, Clear Channel Communications (now known today as <a href="iHeartMedia">iHeartMedia</a>) included the song on its <a href="2001%20Clear%20Channel%20memorandum">post-9/11 "do not play" list</a>.

On 1 January 2005, the <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> named "Imagine" the greatest song in the past 100 years as voted by listeners on the show "<a href="50%20Tracks">50 Tracks</a>". The song ranked number 30 on the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>'s list of the 365 <a href="Songs%20of%20the%20Century">Songs of the Century</a> bearing the most historical significance. <a href="Virgin%20Radio">Virgin Radio</a> conducted a UK favourite song survey in December 2005, and listeners voted "Imagine" number one. Australians selected it the greatest song of all time on the <a href="Nine%20Network">Nine Network</a>'s "<a href="20%20to%201">20 to 1</a>" countdown show on 12 September 2006. They voted it eleventh in the youth radio network <a href="Triple%20J">Triple J</a>'s Hottest 100 Of All Time on 11 July 2009.
<a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> said, "in many countries around the world – my wife and I have visited about 125 countries– you hear John Lennon's song 'Imagine' used almost equally with national anthems." On 9 October 2010, which would have been Lennon's 70th birthday, the Liverpool Singing Choir performed "Imagine" along with other Lennon songs at the unveiling of the <a href="John%20Lennon%20Peace%20Monument">John Lennon Peace Monument</a> in <a href="Chavasse%20Park">Chavasse Park</a>, <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, England. Beatles producer <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a> praised Lennon's solo work, singling out the composition: "My favourite song of all was 'Imagine'". Music critic <a href="Paul%20Du%20Noyer">Paul Du Noyer</a> described "Imagine" as Lennon's "most revered" post-Beatles song. Authors Ben Urish and Ken Bielen called it "the most subversive pop song recorded to achieve classic status". Fricke commented: "'Imagine' is a subtly contentious song, Lennon's greatest combined achievement as a balladeer and agitator."

Urish and Bielen criticised the song's instrumental music as overly sentimental and melodramatic, comparing it to the music of the pre-rock era and describing the vocal melody as understated. According to Blaney, Lennon's lyrics describe hypothetical possibilities that offer no practical solutions; lyrics that are at times nebulous and contradictory, asking the listener to abandon political systems while encouraging one similar to <a href="communism">communism</a>. Author Chris Ingham indicated the hypocrisy in Lennon, the millionaire rock star living in a mansion, encouraging listeners to imagine living their lives without possessions. Others argue that Lennon intended the song's lyrics to inspire listeners to imagine if the world "could" live without possessions, not as an explicit call to give them up. Blaney commented: "Lennon knew he had nothing concrete to offer, so instead he offers a dream, a concept to be built upon."

Blaney considered the song to be "riddled with contradictions. Its hymn-like setting sits uncomfortably alongside its author's plea for us to envision a world without religion." Urish and Bielen described Lennon's "dream world" without a heaven or hell as a call to "make the best world we can here and now, since this is all this is or will be". In their opinion, "because we are asked merely to imagine – to play a 'what if' game, Lennon can escape the harshest criticisms". Former Beatle <a href="Ringo%20Starr">Ringo Starr</a> defended the song's lyrics during a 1981 interview with <a href="Barbara%20Walters">Barbara Walters</a>, stating: "[Lennon] said 'imagine', that's all. Just imagine it."

The morning after the <a href="November%202015%20Paris%20attacks">November 2015 Paris attacks</a>, German pianist <a href="Davide%20Martello">Davide Martello</a> brought a grand piano to the street out in front of the <a href="Bataclan%20%28theatre%29">Bataclan</a>, where 89 concertgoers had been shot dead the night before, and performed an instrumental version to honour the victims of the attacks; video of his performance went <a href="viral%20video">viral</a>. This led Katy Waldman of "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" to ponder why "Imagine" had become so frequently performed as a response to tragedy. In addition to its general popularity, she noted its musical simplicity, its key of C major, "the plainest and least complicated key, with no <a href="sharp%20%28music%29">sharps</a> or <a href="flat%20%28music%29">flats</a>" aside from one passage with "a plaintive <a href="major%20seventh%20chord">major seventh chord</a> that allows a tiny bit of <a href="E%20minor">E minor</a> into the <a href="Tonic%20%28music%29">tonic</a>". That piano part, "gentle as a rocking chair", underpins lyrics that, Waldman says, "belongs to the tradition of hymns or spirituals that visualize a glorious afterlife without prophesizing any immediate end to suffering on earth". This understanding is also compounded by the historical context of Lennon's own violent death, "remind[ing] us that the universe can run ramshod over idealistic people". Ultimately, the song "captures the fragility of our hope after a violent or destructive event ... [bu]t also reveals its tenacity".

In June 2017, the <a href="National%20Music%20Publishers%20Association">National Music Publishers Association</a> awarded "Imagine" a Centennial Song Award and recognized Lennon's desire to add Yoko Ono as a co-author of the song.

In December 1971, Lennon and Ono appeared at the <a href="Apollo%20Theater">Apollo Theater</a> in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>. Lennon performed "Imagine" with an acoustic guitar, yielding the earliest known live recording of the song, later included on the "<a href="John%20Lennon%20Anthology">John Lennon Anthology</a>" (1998). In 1975, he sang "Imagine" during his final public performance, a birthday celebration for <a href="Lew%20Grade">Lew Grade</a>.

<a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> performed the song regularly on his world tour in 1980, including at his free concert in <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>, a few blocks away from Lennon's apartment in <a href="The%20Dakota">The Dakota</a>. On 9 December 1980, the day after Lennon's murder, <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a> performed "Imagine" as a tribute to him during their <a href="Wembley%20Arena">Wembley Arena</a> show in <a href="London">London</a>. In 1983, <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a> performed it in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> during his <a href="Serious%20Moonlight%20Tour">Serious Moonlight Tour</a>, on the third anniversary of Lennon's death. On 9 October 1990, more than one billion people listened to a broadcast of the song on what would have been Lennon's 50th birthday. <a href="Ratau%20Mike%20Makhalemele">Ratau Mike Makhalemele</a> covered the song on an EP of Lennon covers in 1990. In 1991–92, <a href="Liza%20Minnelli">Liza Minnelli</a> performed the song in her <a href="Live%20from%20Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall%20%28Liza%20Minnelli%20album%29">show</a> at <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a>. <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a> gave his rendition of the song, with the <a href="Morehouse%20College%20Glee%20Club">Morehouse College Glee Club</a>, during the closing ceremony of the <a href="1996%20Summer%20Olympics">1996 Summer Olympics</a> as a tribute to the victims of the <a href="Centennial%20Olympic%20Park%20bombing">Centennial Olympic Park bombing</a>. In 2001, <a href="Neil%20Young">Neil Young</a> performed it during the benefit concert "". <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> performed "Imagine" during the benefit "<a href="Tsunami%20Aid">Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope</a>". <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a> performed the song during the <a href="2006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> opening ceremony. <a href="Herman%20Cain">Herman Cain</a>, then the CEO of <a href="Godfather%27s%20Pizza">Godfather's Pizza</a>, performed a parody of "Imagine", identified as "Imagine There's No Pizza", before the Omaha Press Club in 1991, which became a viral video when he <a href="Herman%20Cain%202012%20presidential%20campaign">ran for President of the United States</a> 20 years later.

Since 2005, "Imagine" has been played prior to the <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a> <a href="Times%20Square%20Ball">ball drop</a> at <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>'s <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a>. Beginning in 2010, the song has been performed live; first by <a href="Taio%20Cruz">Taio Cruz</a>, then in 2011 by <a href="CeeLo%20Green">CeeLo Green</a> and in 2012 by <a href="Train%20%28band%29">Train</a>. However, Green received criticism for changing the lyric "and no religion too" to "and all religions true", resulting in an immediate backlash from fans who believed that he had disrespected Lennon's legacy by changing the lyrics of his most iconic song. Green defended the change by saying it meant to represent "a world [where you] could believe what [you] wanted". The event got media attention outside of the US, with Britain's "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" stating "Lennon's original lyrics don't praise pluralism or interchangeable religious truths – they damn them".

More than 200 artists have recorded <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a>s of "Imagine". <a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a> included it on 1972's "<a href="Come%20from%20the%20Shadows">Come from the Shadows</a>" and <a href="Diana%20Ross">Diana Ross</a> recorded a version for her 1973 album, "<a href="Touch%20Me%20in%20the%20Morning%20%28album%29">Touch Me in the Morning</a>". In 1995, <a href="Blues%20Traveler">Blues Traveler</a> recorded the song for the "" album and <a href="Dave%20Matthews">Dave Matthews</a> has performed the song live with them. American guitarist <a href="Eva%20Cassidy">Eva Cassidy</a> recorded a version for her 2002 album <a href="Imagine%20%28Eva%20Cassidy%20album%29">of the same name</a>; this version failed to reach the top 100 in the United Kingdom but peaked at number 35 on the <a href="UK%20Independent%20Singles%20and%20Albums%20Charts">UK Indie Chart</a>. <a href="A%20Perfect%20Circle">A Perfect Circle</a> covered the song for the album "<a href="Emotive%20%28album%29">eMOTIVe</a>", released in 2004. <a href="Dolly%20Parton">Dolly Parton</a> recorded the song for her 2005 covers album "<a href="Those%20Were%20the%20Days%20%28Dolly%20Parton%20album%29">Those Were the Days</a>". <a href="David%20Archuleta">David Archuleta</a> reached number 36 in US and number 31 in Canada with his rendition. A cover version of the song, performed by Italian singer <a href="Marco%20Carta">Marco Carta</a>, entered the top 20 in Italy in 2009, peaking at number 13. <a href="Seal%20%28musician%29">Seal</a>, <a href="Pink%20%28singer%29">Pink</a>, <a href="India%20Arie">India.Arie</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Beck">Jeff Beck</a>, <a href="Konono%20N%C2%BA1">Konono Nº1</a>, <a href="Oumou%20Sangar%C3%A9">Oumou Sangaré</a> and others recorded a version for <a href="Herbie%20Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a>'s 2010 album "<a href="The%20Imagine%20Project">The Imagine Project</a>".

On 13 February 2011, the recording—with Pink, Seal, <a href="Mali">Mali</a>an singer Oumou Sangaré, India.Arie and Jeff Beck won a Grammy award for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Collaboration%20with%20Vocals">Best Pop Vocal Collaboration</a>.

The song was performed as part of the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics%20closing%20ceremony">closing ceremony</a> of the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>. Performed by the Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Choir and the Liverpool Signing Choir, the choirs sang the first verse and accompanied Lennon's original vocals during the rest of the song.

Canadian heraldry

Canadian heraldry is the cultural tradition and style of <a href="Coat%20of%20arms">coats of arms</a> and other <a href="Heraldry">heraldic</a> achievements in both modern and historic <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. It includes national, provincial, and civic arms, <a href="nobility">noble</a> and personal arms, <a href="ecclesiastical%20heraldry">ecclesiastical heraldry</a>, heraldic displays as corporate <a href="logo">logo</a>s, and Canadian <a href="Blazon">heraldic descriptions</a>.

Derived mainly from heraldic traditions in <a href="French%20heraldry">France</a> and the <a href="Heraldry%23Gallo-British%20heraldry">United Kingdom</a>, Canadian heraldry also incorporates distinctly <a href="National%20symbols%20of%20Canada">Canadian symbols</a>, especially native <a href="plantae">flora</a> and <a href="Animalia">fauna</a>, references to the <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> and other <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">aboriginal</a> peoples of Canada, and uniquely Canadian elements such as the <a href="Canadian%20pale">Canadian pale</a>, derived from the <a href="Flag%20of%20Canada">Canadian flag</a>. A unique system of <a href="cadency">cadency</a> is used for daughters inheriting arms, and a special symbol for <a href="United%20Empire%20Loyalist">United Empire Loyalist</a>s.

In 1988, governance of both personal and corporate heraldry in Canada was patriated from the heraldic authorities in <a href="College%20of%20Arms">England</a> and <a href="Court%20of%20the%20Lord%20Lyon">Scotland</a>, with the formation of the <a href="Canadian%20Heraldic%20Authority">Canadian Heraldic Authority</a>, which now has exclusive jurisdiction over granting awards of arms in Canada. Coats of arms are used throughout Canada by all levels of government, in many cases including royal insignia as a mark of authority, as in the recently granted arms of the House of Commons and the Senate, and of Parliament as a combined body. Use of armorial bearings is not limited to governmental bodies; all citizens of Canada have the right to petition for an award of arms, as do other entities including businesses and religious institutions. The granting of arms is regarded as an honour from <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Canada">the Queen of Canada</a>, via her <a href="List%20of%20viceregal%20representatives%20of%20Elizabeth%20II">Viceroy</a>, the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of Canada</a>, and thus are bestowed only on those whom the Chief Herald has deemed worthy of receiving a grant of arms.

Before the arrival of Europeans, the <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20of%20Canada">Aboriginal peoples of Canada</a> used symbolic artwork to denote their allegiance to a particular <a href="clan">clan</a> or <a href="pantribal%20sodalities">pantribal sodalities</a>, and to show legendary and religious themes. For the West Coast peoples this would be done with carvings on totem poles, carvings integrated into <a href="longhouse">longhouse</a>s and smaller wooden objects like boxes, masks, and canoes. For Plains people the <a href="Plains%20hide%20painting">Plains hide painting</a> tradition painted images onto tipis, shields, and other animal-hide objects.

The history of European-style heraldry in Canada began with the raising of the <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20France">Royal Arms of France</a> (modern) by French explorer <a href="Jacques%20Cartier">Jacques Cartier</a> in 1534, when he landed on Canadian soil at what is now known as the <a href="Gasp%C3%A9%20Peninsula">Gaspé Peninsula</a>. From the beginning of the <a href="History%20of%20Canada">settlement</a> of Canada until the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281763%29">Treaty of Paris</a> in 1763, armorial bearings were largely either brought from France or awarded by the <a href="List%20of%20French%20monarchs">French crown</a>. A notable exception is the <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20Nova%20Scotia">Coat of Arms of Nova Scotia</a>, awarded in 1625 by <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> (making it the oldest coat of arms in the Commonwealth outside the United Kingdom), in use until 1868, when it was replaced by a new achievement. The original was later rediscovered, and replaced the 1868 version in 1929. The present-day <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Coat of Arms of Newfoundland and Labrador</a> was granted to a private company shortly after that of Nova Scotia, although it did not enter use as the region's arms until the 1920s. The Coat of Arms of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> was first used in 1671 (although no record of the original grant exists, and it was not registered with the College of Arms in London until 1921), and has been in continual use with minor cosmetic changes to the official depiction ever since.

Upon ratification of the Treaty of Paris, the <a href="The%20Crown">British Crown</a> confirmed the French awards of arms. Between 1763 and 1867, the year of <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Canadian Confederation</a>, there is little evidence of much heraldic activity. After Confederation, however, heraldry in Canada became more widespread, including grants of arms to the provinces, various educational institutions, municipalities, and individuals. In the immediate post-Confederation period, arms were granted to <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>, <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20Ontario">Ontario</a>, and <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20Quebec">Quebec</a>, although not to the country as a whole. In the period between the Treaty of Paris and Confederation, the <a href="Royal%20Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Arms of the United Kingdom</a> had served as the emblem of authority within Canada.

From 1763 until 1988, heraldry in Canada was under the authority of the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> in London and the <a href="Court%20of%20the%20Lord%20Lyon">Court of the Lord Lyon</a> in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. In the late 1980s, the Queen issued <a href="Letters%20patent">Letters Patent</a> creating the Canadian Heraldic Authority.

Before the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>: either the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> in <a href="London">London</a> or, if of <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a> descent, the <a href="Court%20of%20the%20Lord%20Lyon">Court of the Lord Lyon</a> in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. This process was quite lengthy—and costly. In addition, the <a href="herald">herald</a>s in Britain could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and symbols. In time, many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office that would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians.

As early as 1967, plans were reportedly in the works to transfer overview of heraldry from the College of Arms in the UK to Canada. The push for a wholly Canadian heraldic system came largely from the Heraldry Society of Canada (now the <a href="Royal%20Heraldry%20Society%20of%20Canada">Royal Heraldry Society of Canada</a>) almost from its inception, though it was not seen as a priority by successive national governments. In 1986, <a href="Vicki%20Huntington">Vicki Huntington</a>, a politician from British Columbia, forwarded a brief written by the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada calling for the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority to a staff member in then-<a href="Secretary%20of%20State%23Canada">Secretary of State</a> <a href="David%20Crombie">David Crombie</a>'s office. Mr. Crombie had his department organise a meeting in Ottawa the following year, to which many national and international heraldic experts were invited. The meeting concluded with "a strong recommendation to government that an Authority be created."

Two years later, on 4 June 1988, then-<a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General</a> <a href="Jeanne%20Sauv%C3%A9">Jeanne Sauvé</a> authorised the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, made possible by <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> signed by Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, on the advice of her <a href="Canadian%20Privy%20Council">Canadian Privy Council</a>, and presented by her son, <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Earl%20of%20Wessex">Prince Edward</a>. As a result, Canada became the first <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a> outside the United Kingdom to have its own heraldic authority. Canada also provides full equality to <a href="Canadian%20heraldry%23Status%20of%20women">women</a> in terms of inheriting and transmitting arms. Additionally, all <a href="armiger">armiger</a>s within Canada may file for trademark protection of their grant of arms under the Trade-Marks Act.

The Royal Arms of Canada are the official <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Canada">Canadian monarch</a> and thus also of <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. They incorporate many distinctive Canadian elements such as the maple leaves, and the reference to the French Royal Arms in the fourth quarter which replace or add to those derived from the British.

The arms are used as a mark of authority by various government agencies and representatives, including the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> and <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Canada">Cabinet</a>, the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, most <a href="Court%20system%20of%20Canada%23Symbols">courts</a> (including the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court</a>), and, formerly, <a href="Parliament%20of%20Canada">Parliament</a>, and on the cover of <a href="Canadian%20passport">Canadian passport</a>s. Since 1962, a <a href="Heraldic%20flag%23Banner">banner</a> of the arms, <a href="Defacement%20%28flag%29">defaced</a> with a variant of the Queen's <a href="Royal%20Cypher">cypher</a>, has formed the <a href="Queen%27s%20Personal%20Canadian%20Flag">Royal Standard of Canada</a>, for use by the Canadian sovereign. The personal <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">flag of the Governor General</a> has featured the crest of the arms of Canada on a blue background since 1981.

On 15 February 2008, the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons</a> was granted its own heraldic symbol following a request by <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">Commons Speaker</a> <a href="Peter%20Milliken">Peter Milliken</a> to the Canadian Heraldic Authority. The new symbol for Parliament is a badge of the escutcheon in the Arms of Canada superimposed on the <a href="Ceremonial%20mace">mace</a> used by the House of Commons as a symbol of its authority derived from the Crown. The <a href="Senate%20of%20Canada">Senate</a> was granted a similar badge on 15 April 2008, using its own mace. Parliament as a whole has been granted the right to use the escutcheon of the Arms of Canada, superimposed over the maces of the Commons and Senate in <a href="saltire">saltire</a>.

In June 2008, <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> <a href="Pat%20Martin">Pat Martin</a> introduced a <a href="Motion%20%28democracy%29">motion</a> into the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons</a> calling on the government to amend the coat of arms to incorporate symbols representing Canada's <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a>, <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> and <a href="M%C3%A9tis%20people%20%28Canada%29">Métis</a> peoples.

In much the same way that there is a national coat of arms, each <a href="Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">province and territory</a> possesses its own unique arms; Saskatchewan's is known formally as Her Majesty's Arms in Right of Saskatchewan. The year after Confederation, <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> issued Royal Warrants assigning arms to Canada's original four provinces: <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20Quebec">Quebec</a>, <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, and <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>.

Each includes specific local symbolism; most also include symbolism derived from the coats of arms of the United Kingdom, France, or both. Since 1868, each province and territory within Canada has been granted arms through warrants either from the monarch directly or from the <a href="Governor-General">Governor General</a>, or has assumed them through other means.

Apart from <a href="Flag%20of%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a>, each province and territory bears at least some elements from its coat of arms upon its flag. The flags of <a href="Flag%20of%20British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="Flag%20of%20New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>, <a href="Flag%20of%20Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, and <a href="Flag%20of%20Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a> are <a href="Heraldic%20flag%23Banner">banners</a> of the provincial arms, while <a href="Flag%20of%20Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="Flag%20of%20Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, <a href="Flag%20of%20Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="Flag%20of%20Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, the <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a>, and the <a href="Flag%20of%20Yukon">Yukon</a> each have the shield of the local coat of arms on their flags, with other design elements. The <a href="flag%20of%20Nunavut">flag of Nunavut</a> uses some elements from its coat of arms along with other symbols and colours. The shield of the arms of each province, on a blue background and circled with ten gold maple leaves, the whole surmounted by a crown, forms the main element of the <a href="Flags%20of%20the%20Lieutenant-Governors%20of%20Canada">flag of the Lieutenant-Governor</a> of that province. The exceptions are Nova Scotia, which uses the <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a> defaced with the shield of Nova Scotia, surrounded by green maple leaves, and Quebec, which uses the shield on a white circle with the provincial motto inscribed below.

The use of armorial bearings among is inconsistent, because many of them have been assumed and brought into force by local governmental authorities, rather than granted from the Crown. Many municipal coats of arms either awarded or confirmed by the Canadian Heraldic Authority may be found within the <a href="Public%20Register%20of%20Arms%2C%20Flags%20and%20Badges%20of%20Canada">Public Register of Arms</a>, though the online version of the Register is not complete.

In Canada, every <a href="Canadian%20nationality%20law">citizen</a> has the right to petition the Crown for a grant of arms. Canadians who have been appointed to the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a> are automatically entitled to receive an award of arms including the <a href="Arms%20of%20Canada%23Symbolism">ribbon of the Order</a>, or should they already be armigerous, to encircle their extant arms with the ribbon. Amongst others, all members of the <a href="Queen%27s%20Privy%20Council%20for%20Canada">Privy Council</a> are entitled to <a href="Supporters%20%28heraldry%29">supporters</a> in their arms, as are the Speakers of the House of Commons and the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Senate%20of%20Canada">Senate</a>, Companions of the Order of Canada, Commanders of the Orders of <a href="Order%20of%20Military%20Merit%20%28Canada%29">Military Merit</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20Merit%20of%20the%20Police%20Forces">Merit of the Police Forces</a>, and of the <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Royal Victorian Order</a>.

Due to the history of Canada, heraldry in the country has incorporated aboriginal and <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> symbols and elements. The <a href="Coat%20of%20Arms%20of%20Nunavut">Coat of Arms of Nunavut</a>, for example, includes elements such as an <a href="inukshuk">inukshuk</a>, a <a href="qulliq">qulliq</a>, and an <a href="igloo">igloo</a>, all of which are references to the <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> peoples who live in the area, while the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority include <a href="raven">raven</a>s, a First Nations symbol of creation and transformation. In addition, some Canadians choose to bear their arms on a roundel rather than a shield, a reference to a drumhead; an example is the coat of arms of Nunavut.

In many systems of heraldry, the arms of each living person must be unique. English heraldry has used armorial variants to distinguish the arms of brothers from their father's arms and from each other since the 13th century; this is now normally done by the system of marks or "brisures" set up by the early Tudor herald <a href="John%20Writhe">John Writhe</a>. Canada adds a unique series of brisures for use by female children who inherit arms. As in other heraldic systems, these cadency marks are not always used; in any case, when the heir succeeds (in Canada, this is normally the first child, whether male or female, according to strict <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>; however, the grantee may choose another person as heir), the mark of cadency is removed and the heir uses the plain coat of arms.

The Canadian <a href="Pale%20%28heraldry%29">pale</a>, a pale division amounting to half the entire field, derived from the <a href="Flag%20of%20Canada">Canadian flag</a>, is widely used in Canadian heraldry, while the Canadian <a href="fess">fess</a>, a similar horizontal division, has been used once. The term "érablé", referring to maple leaves, is often used in Canadian arms. For example, as a "tressure érablé" in the arms of the <a href="Monarchist%20League%20of%20Canada">Monarchist League of Canada</a>, "coronets érablé" in the arms of <a href="Greater%20Sudbury">Sudbury</a> and Canada's National History Society, and as a partition much like <a href="Engrailed%20%28heraldry%29">engrailed</a> or <a href="Line%20%28heraldry%29%23Indented%20and%20dancetty">dancetty</a>. Canadian animals and birds, both real and fantastical, have also been widely used in arms, including the mythical raven-bears in the arms of the Canadian Heraldic Authority.

In both the English and the Scottish systems of heraldry, from which the Canadian draws many of its practices, a woman does not inherit or transmit arms unless she is an "<a href="heraldic%20heiress">heraldic heiress</a>", that is, a daughter of an armiger who has no sons. In Canadian heraldry, by contrast, women may inherit arms on an equal basis with their brothers (if any). Women in Canada may also transmit their arms to their heirs, regardless of gender. This system of equality for men and women is a result of provisions in the <a href="Canadian%20Charter%20of%20Rights%20and%20Freedoms">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>, which guarantee, among other things, freedom from discrimination under the law on the basis of sex.

Those who are descended from the citizens loyal to the British Crown who fled the United States during and shortly after the <a href="American%20Revolution">revolution</a> are known in Canada as <a href="United%20Empire%20Loyalist">United Empire Loyalist</a>s, and are entitled to the use of special <a href="coronet">coronet</a>s within their arms, if arms are granted to them. There are two versions of the Loyalist coronet: the civil, which is made up of alternating oak and maple leaves, and the military, made up of maple leaves alternating with crossed swords; the latter is reserved for use by the families of those who served in the British military during the revolution. Proof of Loyalist heritage must be provided to the Canadian Heraldic Authority before permission is granted to use the coronet in arms. Unlike the common use of coronets in heraldry, the Loyalist coronet denotes no rank of nobility or royalty, but instead alludes to ancestral allegiance.

In Canadian heraldry, helmets play little role and are not blazoned; as such, the arminger can display their helm in whatever style they choose. One notable example of a non-traditional helmet used in Canadian heraldry is the arms of <a href="Julie%20Payette">Julie Payette</a>, <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of Canada</a>, which bears an <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>'s helmet as the helm. Other examples include <a href="nasal%20helmet">nasal helmet</a>s, <a href="Corinthian%20helmet">Corinthian helmet</a>s, and <a href="parka">parka</a> hoods.

All citizens of Canada, as well as corporate bodies, may petition the Crown for an award of arms. For an individual to obtain a grant of arms, a petition must be sent to the <a href="Chief%20Herald%20of%20Canada">Chief Herald</a>, providing a biography, references, and completed application forms. If the grant is approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, the grant documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the <a href="Government%20of%20Canada">Government of Canada</a> to cover costs of research and artwork; the fees are not to purchase the grant of arms. For <a href="corporation">corporation</a>s and institutions the process is similar.

Those individuals and institutions who are already armigerous through recognised heraldic authorities worldwide may apply to the Canadian Heraldic Authority to have their arms registered. There is no cost associated with application for registration, and it takes less time, approximately three months, than application for a new award of arms, which takes approximately twelve to fourteen months.

SS Minnesotan

SS "Minnesotan was a <a href="cargo%20ship">cargo ship</a> built in 1912 for the <a href="American-Hawaiian%20Steamship%20Company">American-Hawaiian Steamship Company</a>. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> she was known as USAT "Minnesotan in service for the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> and USS "Minnesotan" (ID-4545) in service for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. She ended her career as the SS "Maria Luisa R." under Italian ownership. She was built by the <a href="Maryland%20Steel%20Company">Maryland Steel Company</a> as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was employed in inter-coastal service via the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a> and the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> after it opened.

In World War I, USAT "Minnesotan" carried cargo and animals to France <a href="ship%20chartering">under charter</a> to the U.S. Army from September 1917. When transferred to the U.S. Navy in August 1918, USS "Minnesotan" continued in the same duties, but after the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> she was converted to a <a href="troop%20transport">troop transport</a> and returned over 8,000 American troops from France. Returned to American-Hawaiian in 1919, "Minnesotan" resumed inter-coastal cargo service, and, at least twice, carried racing yachts from the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. East Coast</a> to California.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, "Minnesotan" was requisitioned by the <a href="War%20Shipping%20Administration">War Shipping Administration</a> and initially sailed between New York and <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> ports. In the latter half of 1943, "Minnesotan" sailed between Indian Ocean ports. The following year the cargo ship sailed between New York and ports in the United Kingdom, before returning to the Caribbean. In July 1949, American-Hawaiian sold "Minnesotan" to Italian owners who renamed her "Maria Luisa R."; she was scrapped in 1952 at <a href="Bari">Bari</a>.

In September 1911, the <a href="American-Hawaiian%20Steamship%20Company">American-Hawaiian Steamship Company</a> placed an order with the <a href="Maryland%20Steel%20Company">Maryland Steel Company</a> of <a href="Sparrows%20Point%2C%20Maryland">Sparrows Point, Maryland</a>, for four new <a href="cargo%20ships">cargo ships</a>—"Minnesotan", , , and . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum cost of $640,000 per ship. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5% down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance. Provisions of the deal allowed that some of the nine installments could be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of "Minnesotan", including financing costs, was $65.65 per <a href="deadweight%20tonnage">deadweight ton</a>, which totaled just under $668,000.

"Minnesotan" (Maryland Steel yard no. 124) was the first ship built under the original contract. She was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 8 June 1912, and delivered to American-Hawaiian in September. "Minnesotan" was , and was in length and <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">abeam</a>. She had a <a href="deadweight%20tonnage">deadweight tonnage</a> of , and her cargo holds had a storage capacity of . "Minnesotan" had a speed of , and was powered by a single <a href="quadruple%20expansion%20steam%20engine">quadruple-expansion</a> <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a> with oil-fired <a href="boiler">boiler</a>s, that drove a single <a href="screw%20propeller">screw propeller</a>.

When "Minnesotan" began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> ports via the Tehuantepec Route to <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—<a href="Salina%20Cruz">Salina Cruz, Oaxaca</a>, for eastbound cargo, and <a href="Coatzacoalcos">Coatzacoalcos</a>, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and would traverse the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a> on the <a href="Tehuantepec%20National%20Railway">Tehuantepec National Railway</a>. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. "Minnesotan" sailed in this service on the east side of North America.

After the <a href="United%20States%20occupation%20of%20Veracruz">United States occupation of Veracruz</a> on 21 April 1914 (which found six American-Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports), the <a href="Victoriano%20Huerta">Huerta</a>-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping. This loss of access, coupled with the fact that the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> was not yet open, caused American-Hawaii to return in late April to its historic route of sailing around South America via the <a href="Straits%20of%20Magellan">Straits of Magellan</a>. With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route.

In October 1915, landslides closed the Panama Canal and all American-Hawaiian ships, including "Minnesotan", returned to the Straits of Magellan route again. "Minnesotan"s exact movements from this time through early 1917 are unclear. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was <a href="ship%20chartering">chartered</a> for transatlantic service. She may also have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>s, cocoa, rubber, and <a href="manganese">manganese ore</a>.

On 11 September 1917, some five months after the United States declared war on <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> <a href="ship%20chartering">chartered</a> "Minnesotan" for transporting animals to Europe in support of the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Force">American Expeditionary Force</a>. Although there is no information about the specific conversion of "Minnesotan", for other ships this typically meant that passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.

On 23 August 1918, "Minnesotan" was transferred to the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> at <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>. She was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> into the <a href="Naval%20Overseas%20Transportation%20Service">Naval Overseas Transportation Service</a> (NOTS) the same day, with <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Commander</a> E. L. Smith, <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Reserve%20Forces">United States Naval Reserve Forces</a> (USNRF), in command. "Minnesotan" was refitted and rearmed and made a brief roundtrip to New York. After taking on a general cargo, "Minnesotan" sailed 4 September to join a convoy from New York. After passing <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 21 September, the cargo ship sailed on to <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> and unloaded. Departing there on 21 October, she sailed for <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News</a> via Gibraltar, arriving back in the United States on 7 November.
"Minnesotan" next took on a load of 798 horses and sailed on 30 November for <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>, where she arrived on 13 December. Stopping at Saint-Nazaire the following day, "Minnesotan" departed for Norfolk on 21 December. After making port at Norfolk on 3 January 1919, the cargo ship sailed for New York, where she was inspected and found to be suitable for use as a troop transport. She was transferred to the <a href="Cruiser%20and%20Transport%20Force">Cruiser and Transport Force</a> on 7 January and fitted with bunks and living facilities over the next three months.

Sailing from New York on 30 March, "Minnesotan" began the first of her four voyages returning American servicemen from France. On 16 April at Saint-Nazaire, "Minnesotan" began her first homeward journey with troops, embarking several companies of the <a href="111th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">111th Infantry Regiment</a> of the <a href="28th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 28th Infantry Division</a>. George W. Cooper, historian of the 2nd Battalion of the 111th Infantry, reported that even though the fighting had been over for some five months, the fear of striking floating mines necessitated that the men wear life jackets for the first three days at sea. "Minnesotan" landed her 1,765 troops in New York on 28 April.

On her next journey, "Minnesotan" loaded some 2,000 men of the 304th Ammunition Train and the <a href="24th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 24th Infantry Division</a>, for what turned out to be a rough passage with widespread <a href="seasickness">seasickness</a>. The men on board were greatly relieved when land was spotted, and the ship docked at <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, on 29 May.
Details of "Minnesotan"s third journey are not available, but her final journey began by sailing from <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> on 23 July with elements of the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 4th Infantry Division</a> and ended upon arrival at <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> on 3 August. In total, she carried 8,038 troops in four voyages from France. By 15 August, "Minnesotan" had entered dry dock at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Navy%20Yard">Philadelphia Navy Yard</a> to prepare for decommissioning, which took place six days later. She was then returned to American-Hawaiian. <a href="Leslie%20White">Leslie White</a>, later a noted American anthropologist, was a crewman aboard USS "Minnesotan".

"Minnesotan" resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, "Minnesotan" continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal. Hints at cargos she carried during this time can be gleaned from contemporary news reports from the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>". In March 1928, for example, the newspaper reported that "Minnesotan" sailed from Los Angeles with a $2,500,000 cargo that included raw silk and of copper bullion. The 1,000 bales of silk, picked up in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, were worth $1,000,000 on their own, while the load of copper was reportedly the largest water shipment of Arizona copper to that time. Canned goods, grape juice, and locally grown cotton completed the load. The "Los Angeles Times" also reported that "Minnesotan" delivered a then-record cargo from the East Coast to Los Angeles in October 1930. "Minnesotan" also carried some less-traditional cargo. In February 1928, she delivered one R-class and four six-meter (twenty-foot) sloops to Los Angeles. The five racing yachts, all from East Coast yacht clubs, arrived to sail in the national championships of six-meter and R-class sloops held 10–18 March. "Minnesotan" delivered two other six-meter sloops for new owners in November 1938.

"Minnesotan" did have one mishap during the interwar period. On 3 May 1936, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that the day before, a receding tide had stranded "Minnesotan" about a half-mile (800 m) off of <a href="Monomoy%20Point">Monomoy Point, Massachusetts</a>. Any damage the freighter sustained must have been minor; the cargo ship sailed from New York for San Francisco two weeks later.

"Minnesotan" played a part in several labor difficulties in the interwar years. In March 1935, the crew of "Minnesotan" called a <a href="wildcat%20strike%20action">wildcat strike</a> that delayed the ship's sailing from Los Angeles by a day, but ended the strike after they were ordered back to work by their union. In October 1935, the deckhands and <a href="fireman%20%28steam%20engine%29">firemen</a> of "Minnesotan" and fellow Hawaiian-American ships "Nevadan" and "Golden Tide" walked out—this time with the sanction of their union, the <a href="Sailors%27%20Union%20of%20the%20Pacific">Sailors' Union of the Pacific</a> (SUP)—after American-Hawaiian had suspended a member of the <a href="International%20Seamen%27s%20Union">International Seamen's Union</a>. In that same month, "Minnesotan"s deck engineer, Otto Blaczinsky, was murdered while the ship was in <a href="Port%20of%20Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles Harbor</a>. The Industrial Association of San Francisco, an organization of anti-union businessmen and employers, believed that Blaczinsky was killed because he opposed union policies, and offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Blaczinsky's killer. Threats of another Pacific coast strike in late 1936 caused west coast shippers to squeeze as much cargo as possible into "Minnesotan" and other ships; when "Minnesotan" arrived at Boston in October, "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>" reported that the ship had arrived "literally laden to her <a href="Plimsoll%20line">Plimsoll line</a>".

In September 1941, "Minnesotan" played a peripheral part in a larger protest by union sailors over war bonuses for sailing in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. The SUP struck on "Minnesotan" and fellow American-Hawaiian ship "Oklahoman" on 18 September in sympathy with the <a href="Seafarers%20International%20Union%20of%20North%20America">Seafarers International Organization</a>, which had called a strike on eleven ships a week before. Both of the American-Hawaiian ships were idled while docked in New York. President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> called on the unions to end the strike three separate times during his press conference on 24 September. Roosevelt's admonition was heeded and both unions ended their strike after the <a href="National%20Mediation%20Board">National Mediation Board</a> agreed to address the wartime bonus dispute.

By January 1941, "Minnesotan", though still operated by American-Hawaiian, was engaged in defense work for the U.S. government, sailing to ports in South Africa. After the United States entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, "Minnesotan" was requisitioned by the <a href="War%20Shipping%20Administration">War Shipping Administration</a> and frequently sailed in <a href="convoy">convoy</a>s. Though complete records of her sailings are unavailable, partial records indicate some of the ports "Minnesotan" visited during the conflict and some of the cargo she carried. From July 1942 to April 1943, "Minnesotan" sailed between New York and <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> ports, calling at <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, <a href="Key%20West%2C%20Florida">Key West</a>, <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a>, <a href="Guant%C3%A1namo%20Bay">Guantánamo Bay</a>, and <a href="Crist%C3%B3bal%2C%20Col%C3%B3n">Cristóbal</a>.

In June 1943, "Minnesotan" called at <a href="Mumbai">Bombay</a>. She sailed in the Indian Ocean between <a href="Kolkata">Calcutta</a>, <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, and <a href="Bandar%20Abbas">Bandar Abbas</a> through August. On her last recorded sailing in the Indian Ocean, "Minnesotan" carried steel rails between Colombo and Calcutta. "Minnesotan" was back in New York by early December, and sailed to Florida and back by the end of the month.

On 29 December, "Minnesotan", loaded with a general cargo that included machinery and explosives, sailed as part of convoy HX 273 from New York for <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. "Minnesotan" developed an undisclosed problem and returned to <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's, Newfoundland</a>, where she arrived on 13 January 1944. Thirteen days later, she sailed from St. John's to join convoy HX 276 for Liverpool, where she arrived with the convoy on 7 February. After calling at <a href="Methil%2C%20Fife">Methil</a> and <a href="Loch%20Ewe">Loch Ewe</a>, "Minnesotan" returned to New York in mid March.

"Minnesotan" sailed on another roundtrip to Liverpool in May, but was back in New York by early June. Her last recorded World War II sailings were from New York to Key West, Guantánamo Bay, and Cristóbal, where she arrived in late July 1944. Sources do not reveal where or in what capacity "Minnesotan" spent the remainder of the war.

After the war's end, American-Hawaiian continued operating "Minnesotan" for several more years, but in mid-July 1949, the company announced the sale of "Minnesotan" to Italian owners in a move approved by the <a href="United%20States%20Maritime%20Commission">United States Maritime Commission</a> several days later. The sale of "Minnesotan" was protested by the <a href="Congress%20of%20Industrial%20Organizations">Congress of Industrial Organizations</a> which urged the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> to intervene and to help retain <a href="United%20States%20Merchant%20Marine">American Merchant Marine</a> jobs. Nevertheless, "Maria Luisa R.", the new name of the former "Minnesotan", remained in Italian hands until she was scrapped in 1952 at <a href="Bari">Bari</a>.

The Boys from Baghdad High

The Boys from Baghdad High, also known as Baghdad High, is a British-American-French television documentary film. It was first shown in the United Kingdom at the 2007 <a href="Sheffield%20Doc/Fest">Sheffield Doc/Fest</a>, before airing on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> on 8 January 2008. It also aired in many other countries including France, Australia, the United States, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. It documents the lives of four <a href="Iraqi%20people">Iraqi</a> schoolboys of different religious or ethnic backgrounds over the course of one year in the form of a <a href="video%20diary">video diary</a>. The documentary was filmed by the boys themselves, who were given video cameras for the project.

Directed and produced by Ivan O'Mahoney and Laura Winter of Renegade Pictures and StoryLabTV, for the United Kingdom's <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, <a href="HBO">HBO</a> in the United States, and the Franco-German network <a href="Arte">Arte</a>, "The Boys from Baghdad High" was produced by Alan Hayling and Karen O'Connor for the BBC, Hans Robert Eisenhauer for Arte, and <a href="Sheila%20Nevins">Sheila Nevins</a> for HBO.

"The Boys from Baghdad High" received high viewership when it initially aired in the UK, and was reviewed favourably in the media. It was named the Best News and Current Affairs Film at the European Independent Film Festival, won the Premier Prize at the <a href="Sandford%20St.%20Martin%20Trust">Sandford St. Martin Trust</a> Awards, and was nominated for awards at two film festivals. The documentary also received the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" Readers Award, and a nomination for the <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a> 2008 Television Documentary and Docudrama UK Media Award.

The film brings together the <a href="video%20diary">video diaries</a> recorded by four friends and students at the Tariq bin Ziad High School for Boys in <a href="Zayouna">Zayouna</a>, a mixed-race, middle-class area in the <a href="Karrada">Karrada</a> suburb of <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, Iraq. Entering their final year in 2006, each has high expectations for the year ahead and hope to graduate so they can have a chance to attend university. At the same time, the boys must also deal with the increasing sectarian violence that is starting to extend into Karrada. They face the threats of roadside bombings, the hassles of security checkpoints on their way to school, frequent curfews, the constant presence of American <a href="Apache%20helicopter">Apache helicopter</a>s overhead, and the deterioration of their neighbourhood which becomes rife with assassinations, muggings and kidnappings. Many of their fellow students, unmotivated and academically underperforming, are absent from school.

Ali Shadman is one of the few <a href="Kurdish%20people">Kurdish people</a> remaining in Baghdad. His family are struggling financially and resort to siphoning petrol from their car to run their back-up generator when the power grid fails. When the generator breaks down one night, Ali begins to wonder why he is fixing it against a backdrop of gunfire, instead of studying in peace. Another night, he reports the neighbourhood's news but explains there is nothing to speak of other than the usual explosions, violence, and death. Anmar Refat, a <a href="Syriac%20Christian">Syriac Christian</a>, tries to remain philosophical and hopes that armed gangs will not attack the school. His family, however, are more nervous about any nearby gunfire, as their Christian beliefs increase the threat to their lives if anyone were to find out about them. Anmar has a girlfriend, whom he can contact only via his mobile phone, but he has not heard from her in several days, leaving him worried about whether she has found another boyfriend, or has been hurt in the violence. Hayder Khalid, a <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia</a> Muslim, hopes to become a famous singer-songwriter. He frequently downloads music videos of English-language pop music so he can learn popular English songs and dance moves. Mohammad Raed, a <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a> Muslim, is the <a href="wikt%3Aclass%20clown">class clown</a> at school, who prefers playing sports and fooling around with his friends to studying. Unaware of his behaviour at school, his mother believes he is hard-working, self-sufficient and mature, and believes he will graduate and go to university.

Halfway through the school year, Ali's family moves to the more peaceful <a href="Kurdish%20region">Kurdish region</a> in Northern Iraq but after living there for several months, Ali says that he is homesick and misses the action and noise of Baghdad. Mohammad, feeling lonely, "adopts" a bird with a broken wing and a mouse he finds in the house. This brings him some comfort, but his mother later demands that he get rid of the mouse as she does not want "vermin" in the house. Mohammad's family rejoice when <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> is sentenced, and feel that his later execution was justified, as to do otherwise would have made the Iraqi people look weak. Conversely, Anmar's family is upset at his execution, as they feel that the people who came into power were no better than Hussein was. Hyder's mother says that many Iraqi people were hopeful about the arrival of American forces, and that it is wrong to blame America for all of the problems in Iraq. She notes that the bloodshed has yet to stop as the Sunni continues to kill the Shiite, and vice versa. As the film continues, Hyder's family loses its income and they start to sell their furniture to earn extra money.

At the end of the year, the boys must pass seven final exams to graduate. Anmar, Hyder and Ali each fail two subjects, and are given the option to retake the exams. Anmar passes the retakes and aspires to study English literature in college, and his family decide to move to the safer region of Arbul now that he has graduated. Hyder also retakes his exams and passes, but his family can no longer afford to pay for the university fees. Ali chooses not to retake the exams, and his family leave Iraq. Mohammad fails four subjects and must repeat his senior year. He chooses to do so at a different school while working at his uncle's scooter repair shop. As the documentary closes, it notes that during the year of filming, two of the boys' classmates were killed, six were kidnapped, and seventy-five left Iraq.

"The Boys from Baghdad High" was co-produced and co-directed by Ivan O'Mahoney and Laura Winter. Before working on the film, O'Mahoney had been a <a href="United%20Nations%20Mission%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">United Nations peacekeeper in Bosnia</a> and an attorney in the Netherlands, and had directed the 2006 documentary "How to Plan a Revolution", which profiled two young activists who attempted to remove the Azerbaijani government from power by staging an <a href="Colour%20revolution">"Orange" revolution</a>. He had also worked for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>, <a href="CNN">CNN</a>, and <a href="PBS">PBS</a> in Ethiopia, Iraq, Sudan and Colombia. Winter had previously worked for CNN, "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>", "<a href="CBS%20Evening%20News">CBS Evening News</a>", <a href="CBS%20Radio">CBS Radio</a>, "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>" and the New York "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">Daily News</a>" in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Jordan and Iraq. "The Boys from Baghdad High" was the first time she was credited as a director.

O'Mahoney and Winter began working on the film in 2006. Winter had watched a film called "The Women's Story", about two Iraqi women who had journeyed around the country and filmed what they saw. They wanted to make a documentary about "the people never seen on the evening news, [instead of] presidents, prime ministers, generals and militants ... claiming to know something of Iraq's future". Winter explained that "all these documentaries coming out of Iraq were done for or by adults. Iraqi children had not been more than a UN statistic about the dead, kidnapped or injured", so they decided to concentrate on what they viewed as the "real source of Iraq's future" – teenagers. "I wanted to tell the story of Iraq in a different way. As journalists, we do stories about kids and teenagers, but we don't hear from them. If you go to the UN reports, they are just a number and that's it." O'Mahoney was a little more reticent; he had recently worked in Iraq but did not wish to return due to the <a href="Civil%20war%20in%20Iraq%20%282006-07%29">civil war</a> and the deteriorating condition of the country. When it was decided to use a school as a backdrop to the story, which could also be used to provide a chronological narrative, O'Mahoney and Winter realised it would be too dangerous for the students to be seen with either a Western or Iraqi camera crew because it would draw too much attention to them, and so they decided that the students would film the documentary themselves.

Producers chose boys who were students of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was holding on to the notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district <a href="Karrada">Karrada</a> was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys to take part in the documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not get bored, and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras that the boys were to use. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq via the <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a> department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.

The producers were diligent in ensuring the boys' security. O'Mahoney explained: "They were under very strict security rules when they were filming. They were told not to act as news cameramen. They were not allowed to film in the street. They could only film at school or at home, in secure environments." Winter added, "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the point of the film. Would they normally be running down the street toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they run toward a bombing, knowing that there could be a secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at any second, firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a>, he and his friend celebrate with a <a href="bonfire">bonfire</a> in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school one morning, and reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, "if they see me with a camera they will take me to prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them."

More than 300 hours of footage was recorded by the students and the two Iraqi associate producers. It was transcribed, translated and edited into a 90-minute film. Getting the tapes out of Iraq proved difficult for Winter and O'Mahoney, who remained in the UK. They had to rely on journalists from many <a href="news%20agency">news agencies</a>, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.

The <a href="execution%20of%20Saddam%20Hussein">execution of Saddam Hussein</a>, which Anwar had filmed from the internet from start to finish, was excluded from the documentary. "We had a big debate about whether or not that should go into the film", O'Connor explained. Water continued, "it was one of those things where to see it, it just gets you. But we had to ask ourselves, does it help our story? No." Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. "That's tough", commented Water, "because that's a dishonour to his family."

"The Boys from Baghdad High" received its world première at the 2007 <a href="Sheffield%20Doc/Fest">Sheffield Doc/Fest</a>, an annual film festival for documentary productions held in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. In the US it was screened on 29 April 2008 at the <a href="Tribeca%20Film%20Festival">Tribeca Film Festival</a>, and 1 August 2008 at the <a href="Traverse%20City%20Film%20Festival">Traverse City Film Festival</a>. The first time Winter and O'Mahoney met one of the film's subjects was at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, nearly a year after the filming had completed. Ali and his family had relocated to the US since completing the documentary, and so he was able to attend the screening. Winter and Ali met a second time at the Traverse City Film Festival. The producers had tried to get the boys <a href="Visa%20%28document%29">visa</a>s to enter the UK for a screening in London, but they were denied entry by the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Government</a>.

It premièred on television in the UK on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a>, a national <a href="terrestrial%20television">terrestrial</a> <a href="television%20network">television network</a>, on 8 January 2008 at 9:00 p.m. as part of the "<a href="This%20World%20%28TV%20series%29%232008">This World</a>" documentary series. Overnight viewing figures indicated that 600,000 households had watched the film, which was three percent of the total television audience for that time slot. It was broadcast in France and Germany on the <a href="joint-venture">joint-venture</a> network <a href="Arte">Arte</a> on 18 March 2008 at 9:00 p.m., with the French title "Bagdad, le Bac Sous les Bombes", and "Die Jungs von der Bagdad-High" in Germany. It aired on the American cable network <a href="HBO">HBO</a> as "Baghdad High" on 4 August 2008 at 9:00 p.m., and was available on HBO's <a href="video%20on%20demand">video on demand</a> service until 21 September 2008. The documentary also aired in Australia on the <a href="Special%20Broadcasting%20Service">Special Broadcasting Service</a>, Canada on <a href="CBC%20Newsworld">CBC Newsworld</a>, and in the Netherlands on <a href="VPRO">VPRO</a>.

The documentary was streamed online by the BBC using its <a href="BBC%20iPlayer">BBC iPlayer</a> service to UK residents for seven days after the initial broadcast. A <a href="DVD%20region%20code%23Region%20codes%20and%20countries">Region 2</a> DVD of the documentary can be obtained, although it can only be purchased directly from the BBC and is not available in stores.

Reviews for "The Boys from Baghdad High" were generally favourable. "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" said that giving the video cameras to the students was an excellent idea because the depiction of their school-life versus the increasing danger was captured "with neutral equality [so] that the film is able to capture the interiority of its subjects more acutely than a straight-forward examination of violence would". Thomas Sutcliffe of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" said, "its storyline was governed not by a tick-list of stock narrative dilemmas and secrets but the cruel uncertainties that occupation and insurgency have brought to Baghdad." "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28company%29">Time Out New York</a>" gave the film five out of five stars, and <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> rated it 8 out of 10. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>"s Paul Farhi said, "HBO has carved a niche as the TV home of some of the most compelling programs about the Iraq war ... "Baghdad High" does no harm to HBO's burgeoning war cred[ibility]." "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>", "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>", "<a href="LA%20Weekly">LA Weekly</a>", and the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" also praised the film. At the Question-and-Answer session following a screening at the Tribeca Film Festival, one audience member, a new recruit to the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>, told Ali, who had also attended, "I finally know what life is like behind those walls and what you guys are like, and it's been really, really fantastic."

There were complaints, however, that the documentary did not depict enough of the political aspects of the Iraqi War. Farhi said, "The 90-minute documentary doesn't say much about the larger issues facing Iraq, but it does capture some small and captivating human stories... They happen to live in what one boy describes as 'the most dangerous city on Earth.' You don't see much of Iraq's violence in "Baghdad High", but you surely feel its gravity and their dread." The "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>"s Mark Perigard said that he felt the documentary was "a personal story, not a political one". In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", Mike Hale commented, "While the boys talk frequently about violence and despair, they rarely discuss politics or ethnic differences (with the exception of Anmar, the Christian) and they almost never directly address the American presence. We do hear some parental opinions, which are surprisingly neutral. One mother says: 'We shouldn't blame the Americans for everything. There is something wrong with us too'." Jennifer Marin, a culture columnist from the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", wrote at <a href="About.com">About.com</a>, that while it was innovative, informative and a noble experiment, the footage is "undistinguished and rough because the hands holding the cameras weren't skilled and the eyes framing the shots were not those of artists or keen observers." She thought that, with the exception of Mohammad, the boys lacked charisma, and that the film failed to capture the drama of living in a war-zone, due to the lack of a director calling the shots. Perigard said, "After the time you've invested [as a viewer], it's not nearly satisfying enough. For all the questions this fascinating film raises, it might as well be written in sand."

Many reviewers noted the similarities between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not really all that different from your own teenagers or the kids you went to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." "The Huffington Post" said, "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school."

The <a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">"New York" magazine</a> said that the film's premise of four high-school friends videotaping their senior year "sounds like a fluffy reality show"; Bill Weber of "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" said, "putting the trials of MTV reality-show prima donnas in perspective, the middle-class quartet will be relatable to this BBC/HBO production's audience in their easy embrace of Western kid stuff ... Directors Ivan O'Mahoney and Laura Winter balance [portray] an everyday sense of the adolescents' wartime anxiety with the more commonplace juvenile relief." Similarly, "The Huffington Post" raised comparisons with MTV reality shows, but was pleased to see that the Iraqi boys did not play to the cameras because they had not been exposed to programmes such as "" or "<a href="The%20Paper%20%28TV%20series%29">The Paper</a>". That juvenile relief was commented on by many; "The Washington Post" highlighted Mohammad's adoption of an unwelcome mouse in the house. Hale described a scene where Mohammad and Ali act like hostage and captor. "Suddenly Ali is holding a large knife. 'He's being naughty!' Mohammad says. Ali holds the knife near Mohammad and says, a little too unemotionally: 'Allah! This is the first hostage. I'm going to slaughter him this way.' Mohammad tells him to stop fooling around. Ali relents. 'O.K. He just got a presidential pardon. He can live'." Reuters also commented on this, and more banter between Ali and Mohammad. "Ali is shown making a pretend hostage video with Mohammad, and then teasing his friend for his smelly feet. 'If Chemical Ali really wanted to destroy the north he should have fired a rocket with Mohammad's socks in it'."

The depiction of the stark differences between Iraq and the Western world also received comments. Farhi described the school as having "all the charm of an abandoned prison", and continued with, "visiting a friend who lives a few hundred yards away involves running a potential gauntlet of kidnappers and snipers; getting to school on time means navigating military checkpoints. Before a big exam, teachers frisk their students for explosives," while Perigard said, "at night, their neighbourhoods are riddled with gunfire and explosions". In the New York "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">Daily News</a>", Patrick Huguenin wrote, "American teens wouldn't recognize other scenes showing how life slips into a heavily regulated series of checkpoints and curfews." Hale said, "The way the boys can tell without looking whether it's an Apache or a Chinook helicopter overhead, the way the curtains are always drawn, the level of physical contact and affection among the men ... would be alien to American sensibilities."

"The Boys from Baghdad High" was well-received from its initial screening. It was nominated for a Youth Jury Award at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, shortlisted for an <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a> 2008 UK Media Award in the category for Television Documentary and Docudramas, and the European Independent Film Festival named it the Best News and Current Affairs film. It was nominated for the Readers' Award in the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>", and in May 2008 it won the Premiere Prize at the <a href="Sandford%20St.%20Martin%20Trust">Sandford St. Martin Trust</a> Awards, which acknowledges excellence in religious broadcasting. The Trust's chairman and former BBC Head of Religious Broadcasting <a href="Colin%20Morris%20%28Methodist%20minister%29">Colin Morris</a> said of the documentary, "We saw the way faith breaks into secular life in the chaos of present-day Iraq. Coming from different ethnic and religious backgrounds the boys showed that despite the war their daily preoccupations were much the same as those of teenage boys the world over – girlfriends, parents, sport, fashion, exams, music. Would their friendship survive? Ultimately the programme confronted British viewers with the question: 'What in God's name are we doing there? The film received a standing ovation from the audience at the Traverse City Film Festival, and at the Tribeca Film Festival it was short-listed for the 2008 World Documentary Feature Competition, competing against eleven other non-fiction films for Best Documentary Film and Best New Documentary Filmmaker.

Lieutenant Kijé (Prokofiev)

<a href="Sergei%20Prokofiev">Sergei Prokofiev</a>'s Lieutenant Kijé (, "<a href="Poruchik">Poruchik</a> Kizhe") music was originally written to accompany the <a href="Lieutenant%20Kij%C3%A9%20%28film%29">film of the same name</a>, produced by the <a href="Belarusfilm">Belgoskino film studios</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Leningrad</a> in 1933–34 and released in March <a href="1934%20in%20music">1934</a>. It was Prokofiev's first attempt at <a href="film%20score">film music</a>, and his first commission. 

In the early days of <a href="Sound%20film">sound cinema</a>, among the various distinguished composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonance</a>, characteristics at odds with the <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">cultural norms of the Soviet Union</a>. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.

After the film's successful release, the five-movement "Kijé" suite was first performed in December 1934, and quickly became part of the international concert repertoire. It has remained one of the composer's best-known and most frequently recorded works. Elements of the suite's score have been used in several later films, and in two popular songs of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> era.

<a href="Sergei%20Prokofiev">Sergei Prokofiev</a> graduated from the <a href="Saint%20Petersburg%20Conservatory">Saint Petersburg Conservatory</a> in 1914, having by then acquired an early reputation as an <a href="Avant-garde%20music">avant-garde</a> composer. His biographer Israel Nestyev asserts that the <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Prokofiev%29">Second Piano Concerto</a> of 1913 was "Prokofiev's ticket of admission to the highest circles of Russian modernism".

When the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> broke out in August 1914, Prokofiev avoided military service, possibly because he was the only son of a widow. During the war years he continued to compose; in May 1918, in the period of upheaval following the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> and the beginning of the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, Prokofiev obtained permission from the <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolshevik</a> government to travel abroad, and left for America. His biographers have maintained that he did not "flee the country"; rather that he embarked on a concert tour, which he extended when he became convinced that his career prospects would be better served in America and western Europe. He remained in America until March 1922; he then stayed briefly in the small German town of <a href="Ettal">Ettal</a> before moving to Paris in October 1923.

Rather than treating Prokofiev as a fugitive or exile, the Moscow government chose to consider him as a general ambassador for Soviet culture, and the composer returned the compliment by registering in France as a citizen of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, the new state formed on 20 December 1922 by Russia and the states of the former Russian Empire. Prokofiev expressed support for the political developments in what he still considered his homeland, and was keen to resume contacts there. He was accorded <a href="Very%20important%20person">VIP</a> status when he paid his first visit to the Soviet Union in 1927, for a recital tour. Further trips followed, and in 1930 Prokofiev took a flat in Moscow, although Paris remained his principal home. During this period of rapprochement he consciously sought to simplify his musical language into a form that he believed would be consistent with the official <a href="Soviet%20art">Soviet concept of art</a>.

In the first years of the <a href="silent%20film">silent film era</a>, from the 1890s, films were generally accompanied by live music, often improvised, provided by piano or <a href="pump%20organ">pump organ</a>. In the early 20th century, larger cinemas began to use orchestras, which would accompany the film with out-of-copyright classical pieces or, increasingly, with original compositions. The score for the 1916 classic "<a href="The%20Birth%20of%20a%20Nation">The Birth of a Nation</a>", compiled by <a href="Joseph%20Carl%20Breil">Joseph Carl Breil</a> from various classical works and some original writing, was a landmark in film music, and inspired notable composers of the day to provide scores for silent films. Among these were the Americans <a href="Victor%20Herbert">Victor Herbert</a> and <a href="Mortimer%20Wilson">Mortimer Wilson</a>, from France <a href="Darius%20Milhaud">Darius Milhaud</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Honegger">Arthur Honegger</a>, and the Germans <a href="Gottfried%20Huppertz">Gottfried Huppertz</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Meisel">Edmund Meisel</a>.

In 1927 developments in sound technology brought the arrival of "talking pictures". In these, accompanying music was originally recorded on a <a href="gramophone%20record">disc</a>, separately from the film images, but within two years the "<a href="Movietone%20sound%20system">Movietone</a>" system enabled sound to be captured on the film itself. Music could now be aligned specifically with the film's on-screen action—the so-called "diegetic" approach. Early pioneers of this method were the Germans <a href="Friedrich%20Hollaender">Friedrich Hollaender</a> and <a href="Karol%20Rathaus">Karol Rathaus</a>, who provided the music for "<a href="The%20Blue%20Angel">The Blue Angel</a>" (1930) and "<a href="The%20Murderer%20Dimitri%20Karamazov">The Murderer Dimitri Karamazov</a>" (1931) respectively. By this time in the Soviet Union, the young <a href="Dimitri%20Shostakovich">Dimitri Shostakovich</a> had already begun his prolific career as a composer of film sound-tracks, with "<a href="The%20New%20Babylon">The New Babylon</a>" in 1929 and <a href="Alone%20%281931%20film%29">"Alone"</a> in 1931.

When planning their proposed film <a href="Lieutenant%20Kij%C3%A9%20%28film%29">"Lieutenant Kijé"</a> in 1932, the <a href="Belarusfilm">Belgoskino studios</a> of <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Leningrad</a> asked the expatriate Prokofiev to write the accompanying music. In some respects Prokofiev was a surprising choice; he was at this stage better known abroad than in the Soviet Union, and had acquired a reputation for dissonance. Moreover, his ballet "<a href="Le%20pas%20d%27acier%20%28Prokofiev%29">Le pas d'acier</a>" had fared badly at Moscow's <a href="Bolshoi%20Theatre">Bolshoi Theatre</a> in 1929. The composer's first response was to refuse the commission; a member of the production team recalled that Prokofiev "categorically rejected my proposal. His time was scheduled far into the future, he had never written music for film and he didn't know 'what kind of sauce' to put on it." But, attracted by the story, Prokofiev quickly changed his mind and accepted, seeing this first venture into film music as an opportunity to demonstrate his ability to appeal to a mass Soviet audience.

"Lieutenant Kijé" was one of the <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%231930s">earliest sound films</a> made in the Soviet Union. The origin of the story was a 1927 screenplay by the critic and novelist <a href="Yury%20Tynyanov">Yury Tynyanov</a>, written for the Soviet film director <a href="Sergei%20Yutkevich">Sergei Yutkevich</a>. This project failed, and Tinyanov recast his script into a novella that was published in January 1928. In the early 1930s, when the Belgoskino studios announced their interest in making the film, Tynyanov produced a second script. The story has been described by Prokofiev's biographer Harlow Robinson as "a satire on the stupidity of royalty and the particularly Russian terror of displeasing one's superior". By his own account Prokofiev was at this time "restive, and afraid of falling into academism"; a later critic thought the Kijé story provided ideal material for this "so-often caustic and witty composer".

In the <a href="Winter%20Palace">Russian Imperial Palace</a>, while Tsar <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Paul I</a> sleeps, a dalliance between two courtiers ends with a shriek which wakens the tsar. Enraged, he demands that his officials produce the culprit or face banishment for life. Meanwhile, a clerk's slip of the pen while compiling a military duty roster results in the inclusion in the list of a fictitious officer, "Lieutenant Kijé". When the tsar inspects the list he is intrigued by this name, and asks that the officer be presented to him. The court officials are too terrified of the tsar to admit that a mistake has been made, and are in a dilemma until it occurs to them to blame "Kijé" for the nocturnal disturbance. They inform the tsar, who duly orders the imaginary lieutenant flogged and sent to <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>.

When the real culprit confesses, Kijé is pardoned by the tsar and reinstated in the imperial court with the rank of colonel. The courtiers, in fear of the tsar, are forced to extend their creation's phantom career; thus, he supposedly marries the princess <a href="Gagarin%20family">Gagarina</a>, after which the tsar grants him lands and money and promotes him to general and commander of the army. When Paul demands Kijé's immediate presence, the cornered officials announce that "General Kijé" has, unfortunately, died. A lavish funeral is held, with full military honours. The parsimonious tsar demands the return of Kijé's fortune, but is told by the courtiers that Kijé has spent the money on high living—in fact, they have stolen it. The tsar denounces Kijé as a thief, and posthumously demotes him from general to private.

Despite his lack of experience in composing film music, Prokofiev began his "Kijé" score confidently, later writing: "I somehow had no doubts whatever about the musical language for the film". He told the producers, "What is important to me is the era, the internal meaning of each event, the personality of each hero", and warned them not to expect mere musical "illustrations". He attended rehearsals and made detailed notes of the action and the acting. The period setting of the film appealed to Prokofiev; Robinson comments that the "Kijé" score is one of several works, including the "<a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Prokofiev%29">Classical Symphony</a>", "<a href="The%20Love%20for%20Three%20Oranges">The Love of Three Oranges</a>", "<a href="Cinderella%20%28Prokofiev%29">Cinderella</a>", and "<a href="War%20and%20Peace%20%28opera%29">War and Peace</a>", that show "the composer's fondness for the eighteenth century". The language he chose combined elements of humour and romance with an underlying melancholy—he interpreted the story as more tragic than comic. Prokofiev had heard <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Ravel</a>'s "<a href="Bol%C3%A9ro">Boléro</a>" in Paris, and had been much impressed by the French composer's use of the <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a>, an instrument then rarely used in orchestral compositions outside France but which suited Prokofiev's intentions perfectly. The composer <a href="Gerard%20McBurney">Gerard McBurney</a> has pointed out the "haunting sounds of the <a href="tenor%20saxophone">tenor saxophone</a>" that punctuate the "Kijé" music.

The critic Ernest Chapman refers to Prokofiev's "unfailingly witty and melodious score". It comprises only about 15 minutes of music, written as a series of 16 short fragments or <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s which are repeated at appropriate times during the film's duration, to highlight specific moments in the drama. This approach was a departure in film music from the established form of broad symphonic movements, and was described by Prokofiev's biographer Daniel Jaffé as "well ahead of its time ... one of the most celebrated [film scores] of that era".

The film, directed by <a href="Aleksandr%20Faintsimmer">Alexander Feinzimmer</a>, was made at the Belgoskino studios where the music was recorded under the direction of <a href="Isaak%20Dunayevsky">Isaak Dunayevsky</a>. The Moscow premiere was held on 7 March <a href="1934%20in%20film">1934</a>, after which the film was released in London as "The Tsar Wants to Sleep" and in Paris as "Le Lieutenant Nantes". Prokofiev did not rate the film highly, although he was pleased with his music. After the New York release in December 1934, the critic for "The New York Times" described the film as "calculated to entertain lovers of detail and genuine atmosphere in semi-historical films. Even the introduction of a little <a href="slapstick">slapstick</a> comedy seems quite in keeping with the Russian tradition." Prokofiev's contribution to the film is not acknowledged in this review.

Soon after the film's release, Prokofiev received an invitation from the <a href="Tchaikovsky%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra</a> to create an orchestral suite from his "Kijé" film music—probably the first instance of a film score being adapted into a significant musical work. The guiding light behind the invitation was <a href="Boris%20Gusman">Boris Gusman</a>, the assistant director of the Bolshoi Theatre and a leading film critic. Gusman was a strong supporter of Prokofiev's ambition to rehabilitate himself in the Soviet Union, and had negotiated with the Moscow orchestra for a series of concerts that would showcase the returned composer's talent.

Prokofiev's task was not straightforward; the film's 15 minutes of musical material was fragmentary, and scored for a small <a href="chamber%20music">chamber orchestra</a>. According to Prokofiev's own account, producing the suite was "a devilish job", which, he said, "gave me much more trouble than the music for the film itself, since I had to find the proper form, re-orchestrate the whole thing, polish it up and even combine some of the themes." He wanted the suite to appeal to Soviet audiences hearing concert music for the first time. In an article in "<a href="Izvestia">Izvestia</a>" in 1934 he wrote of such music: "Above all, it must be melodious; moreover the melody must be simple and comprehensible without being repetitive or trivial ... The simplicity should not be an old-fashioned simplicity but a new simplicity". He worked quickly, and had finished the piece by 8 July 1934. Because it was published (Op. 60) by his regular music publisher in Paris, the French form of "Kijé" rather than the Russian "Kizhe" was adopted in the work's title.

The "Kijé" suite is scored for: baritone voice (optional); <a href="piccolo">piccolo</a>; two <a href="flute">flute</a>s; two <a href="oboe">oboe</a>s; two <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>s; two <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a>s; <a href="tenor%20saxophone">tenor saxophone</a>; four <a href="French%20horn">horns</a>; <a href="cornet">cornet</a>; two <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>s; three <a href="trombone">trombone</a>s; <a href="tuba">tuba</a>; <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a>; <a href="snare%20drum">snare drum</a>; <a href="triangle%20%28musical%20instrument%29">triangle</a>; <a href="cymbal">cymbal</a>s; <a href="tambourine">tambourine</a>; <a href="sleigh%20bell">sleigh bell</a>s; <a href="celesta">celesta</a>; <a href="piano">piano</a>; <a href="harp">harp</a>; and <a href="String%20section">strings</a>.

The five <a href="movement%20%28music%29">movements</a> of the suite are organised and titled as follows (bolded capitals identify specified themes):

A distant, mournful <a href="fanfare">fanfare</a> (A), played on a cornet representing a bugle, is followed by a brisk military <a href="march%20%28music%29">march</a> initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo. A passage for brass precedes the introduction of a theme or leitmotif (B) associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively new to the orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.

The principal theme (C) for this movement is based on an old song, "The little grey dove is cooing", for which Prokofiev provided an optional part for baritone voice. The song theme is developed using a range of instruments, before giving way to a second theme introduced by the tenor saxophone; this in turn is replaced, as the movement draws to its close, with the return of the "little grey dove" tune, now ornamented by birdsong.

The movement begins with and is regularly visited by a broad, ceremonial and somewhat pompous melody (D), played on brass and woodwind. In between these formal-sounding statements are a cheerful cornet solo and various elaborations and <a href="variation%20%28music%29">variations</a> on the Kijé theme, which together give the movement a celebratory feel, both boisterous and sentimental.

The principal melody in this movement (E) is taken from an old <a href="Hussar">Hussar</a> song, for which Prokofiev provided an optional baritone part. The melody first appears in a slow and somewhat dissonant statement, after which the pace quickens: sleigh bells, rapid pizzicato strings, and piano combine to give the impression of a fast winter's journey by means of the "<a href="troika%20%28driving%29">troika</a>", a traditional Russian three-horse sled. The ride is accompanied at regular intervals by the song theme, which brings the movement to its close with a slow repetition of its final phrase.

This final movement is largely a mélange of earlier themes, a series of reminiscences of Kijé's imaginary life. The opening cornet fanfare returns, as does Kijé's leitmotif, together with "The little grey dove", this time intertwined with the wedding music. In what Orrin Howard in a programme note for the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Philharmonic">Los Angeles Philharmonic</a> describes as "a wistful, touching farewell", the music reaches its conclusion with a distant rendition of the fanfare.





Prokofiev conducted the first performance of the suite in Paris on 21 December 1934. The piece received its American premiere on 14 October 1937, when <a href="Serge%20Koussevitsky">Serge Koussevitsky</a> conducted the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a>; this performance formed the basis of the first commercial recording of the work, issued in the following year. While Prokofiev was in the United States for the Boston premiere he was greatly sought after by film producers, but although he was flattered and attracted by their offers he never composed a Hollywood film score. The suite rapidly gained popularity, particularly in the US; the choreographer <a href="Michel%20Fokine">Michel Fokine</a> used the music in his ballet ', performed at the <a href="Boston%20Opera%20House%20%281909%29">Boston Opera House</a> on 23 January 1942. A further ballet version ' was devised for Moscow's <a href="Bolshoi%20Ballet">Bolshoi Ballet</a> in 1963, by <a href="Alexander%20Lapauri">Alexander Lapauri</a> and Olga Tarasova, with <a href="Raissa%20Struchkova">Raissa Struchkova</a> in a leading role.

The music critic David Gutman has called the suite "[o]ne of [Prokofiev's] most popular compositions today [and] also one of the most accomplished" Robinson rates the "Kijé" suite among the composer's greatest compositions, alongside <a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet%20%28Prokofiev%29">"Romeo and Juliet"</a> and the <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Prokofiev%29">Second Violin Concerto</a> as "accessible, simple and melodic". In his "Essential Canon of Classical Music" (2001), <a href="David%20Dubal">David Dubal</a> remarks on how the "Kijé" music has thrived in popular culture: "Bits and pieces are used everywhere". Having begun life as a 1930s film soundtrack, parts of the suite began to appear in later films, such as the British "<a href="The%20Horse%27s%20Mouth%20%28film%29">The Horse's Mouth</a>" (1958), and <a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a>'s 1975 parody on Russian literature, "<a href="Love%20and%20Death">Love and Death</a>". In the world of pop music, the "Troika" movement has been adapted several times, beginning in 1958 as "Midnight Sleighride", a jazz band arrangement by <a href="Eddie%20Sauter">Eddie Sauter</a> and <a href="Bill%20Finegan">Bill Finegan</a>. In 1975 the "Troika" tune was used extensively in <a href="Greg%20Lake">Greg Lake</a>'s best-selling pop song "<a href="I%20Believe%20in%20Father%20Christmas">I Believe in Father Christmas</a>", and the "Romance" movement formed the basis of the main theme in <a href="Sting%20%28musician%29">Sting</a>'s 1985 anti-war song "<a href="Russians%20%28song%29">Russians</a>". The “Midnight Sleighride” arrangement of “Troika” was used extensively in the 2018 <a href="Wes%20Anderson">Wes Anderson</a> film "<a href="Isle%20of%20Dogs%20%28film%29">Isle of Dogs</a>" and its marketing campaign.

The 1938 performance of the suite by Koussevitsky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, recorded on <a href="gramophone%20record">78rpm discs</a>, provided the only commercially available recording until the advent of the LP era in the 1950s; a broadcast performance by the <a href="Cleveland%20Orchestra">Cleveland Orchestra</a> under <a href="Fritz%20Reiner">Fritz Reiner</a> in December 1945 was not issued until many years later. In 1951 <a href="Westminster%20Records">Westminster</a> issued <a href="Hermann%20Scherchen">Hermann Scherchen</a>'s recording of the suite with the <a href="Vienna%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Vienna Symphony Orchestra</a>, since which many recordings of the work have been issued under a variety of labels. The first stereo recording was by Reiner with the <a href="Chicago%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Chicago Symphony Orchestra</a> for RCA (March 1957). A 2008 edition of the "Muze" survey of recordings lists 19 available versions by orchestras from Eastern and Western Europe, Asia and the US. The version with optional baritone voice has rarely found its way on to disc; <a href="Erich%20Leinsdorf">Erich Leinsdorf</a> recorded this version twice, with the <a href="Philharmonia%20Orchestra">Philharmonia Orchestra</a> for EMI and with the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> for RCA. <a href="Vladimir%20Ashkenazy">Vladimir Ashkenazy</a> with the <a href="Sydney%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Sydney Symphony Orchestra</a> and <a href="Andrei%20Laptev">Andrei Laptev</a> (2010) provide recent examples. A DVD of the <a href="Bolshoi%20Ballet">Bolshoi Ballet</a> production, featuring <a href="Raisa%20Struchkova">Raisa Struchkova</a> and <a href="Vladimir%20Vasiliev%20%28dancer%29">Vladimir Vasiliev</a>, was released in 2007.

SS Ohioan (1914)

<a href="Steamboat">SS</a> "Ohioan" was a <a href="cargo%20ship">cargo ship</a> built in 1914 for the <a href="American-Hawaiian%20Steamship%20Company">American-Hawaiian Steamship Company</a>. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, she was taken over by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> as USS "Ohioan" (ID-3280).

"Ohioan" was built by the <a href="Maryland%20Steel%20Company">Maryland Steel Company</a> as one of eight sister ships ordered by the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company for inter-coastal service cargo via the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>. When the canal was temporarily closed by <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s in late 1915, "Ohioan" sailed via the <a href="Straits%20of%20Magellan">Straits of Magellan</a> until the canal reopened in mid 1916. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, USS "Ohioan" carried cargo, animals, and a limited number of passengers to France, and returned over 8,000 American troops after the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a>, including the highly decorated American soldier <a href="Alvin%20York">Alvin York</a>. After "Ohioan"s naval service ended in 1919, she was returned to her original owners.

"Ohioan"s post-war career was relatively uneventful until 8 October 1936, when she ran aground near <a href="Seal%20Rock%20%28San%20Francisco%20County%2C%20California%29">Seal Rock</a> at the <a href="Golden%20Gate">Golden Gate</a>, the entrance to <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>. Attempts to free the ship were unsuccessful and, because of the close proximity of the wreck to San Francisco, the grounded "Ohioan" drew large crowds to watch salvage operations. <a href="Angelo%20Joseph%20Rossi">Angelo J. Rossi</a>, the mayor of San Francisco, toured the wreck on 19 October. "Ohioan"s hulk caught fire in March 1937, and the wreck broke into two pieces in a storm in December. As late as 1939, some of "Ohioan"s rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.

In May 1912, the <a href="American-Hawaiian%20Steamship%20Company">American-Hawaiian Steamship Company</a> placed an order with the <a href="Maryland%20Steel%20Company">Maryland Steel Company</a> of <a href="Sparrows%20Point%2C%20Maryland">Sparrows Point, Maryland</a>, for two new <a href="cargo%20ships">cargo ships</a>— and "Ohioan". The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum price of $640,000 per ship. Maryland Steel financed the construction with a credit plan which called for a 5% down payment in cash followed by nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal allowed for some of the nine installments to be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of "Ohioan", including financing costs, was $73.58 per <a href="deadweight%20tonnage">deadweight ton</a>, which came out to just under $730,000.

"Ohioan" (Maryland Steel yard no. 133) was the second ship built under the contract. She was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 24 January 1914, and delivered to American-Hawaiian on 30 June. The ship was , and was in length (<a href="length%20between%20perpendiculars">between perpendiculars</a>) and <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">abeam</a>. She had a <a href="deadweight%20tonnage">deadweight tonnage</a> of , and her cargo holds, which had a storage capacity of , were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so that she could carry perishable products from the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>—such as fresh produce from <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a> farms—to the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a>. "Ohioan" had a single <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a> powered by oil-fired <a href="boiler">boiler</a>s that drove a single <a href="screw%20propeller">screw propeller</a> at a speed of .

When "Ohioan" began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> ports via the <a href="Straits%20of%20Magellan">Straits of Magellan</a> to <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and <a href="pineapple">pineapple</a> from Hawaii, but westbound cargoes were more general in nature. Following the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914, American-Hawaiian ships switched to take that route.

As <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> continued in Europe and increased the demand for defense-related shipping, American-Hawaiian stopped its sugar service. "Ohioan"s specific activities during this time are not known. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was <a href="ship%20chartering">chartered</a> for transatlantic service, or she may have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>s, cocoa, rubber, and <a href="manganese">manganese ore</a>.

Unlike her surviving sister ships, there is no evidence that "Ohioan" was ever <a href="ship%20chartering">chartered</a> by the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>; "Ohioan"s activities between the United States' declaration of war on <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> in April 1917, and her acquisition by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> on 5 August 1918, are unknown. She was commissioned into the <a href="Naval%20Overseas%20Transportation%20Service">Naval Overseas Transportation Service</a> (NOTS) two days later, under a <a href="ship%20chartering">loan charter</a>. After a refit and taking on a load of cargo, "Ohioan" sailed for <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a>, France, where she arrived on 29 August. Dividing the next month between that port and <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>, "Ohioan" sailed for New York on 1 October. Fitted there with horse stalls, she loaded 60 officers and men, and equestrian and general cargo, before sailing on 1 November for <a href="La%20Pallice%20%28harbour%29">La Pallice</a>.

With the signing of the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> on 11 November the fighting came to an end, and the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately. Upon her return to the United States on 5 December, "Ohioan" was selected to become a <a href="troop%20transport">troop transport</a> and transferred from the NOTS to the <a href="Cruiser%20and%20Transport%20Force">Cruiser and Transport Force</a>. Before she could begin returning troops, "Ohioan" had to be converted from a cargo and animal ship. Although sources do not indicate the specific modifications "Ohioan" underwent, typical conversions for other ships included the installation of berths, and adding greatly expanded cooking and toilet facilities to handle the large numbers of men aboard. Similar modifications on "Ohioan"s sister ship took three months, but it is not known how long "Ohioan"s refit took.

In March, "Ohioan" returned 1,627 men to New York, mostly from the 348th Infantry Regiment of the <a href="87th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 87th Infantry Division</a>, followed by another 1,596 officers and men, and 1,000 <a href="homing%20pigeon">homing pigeon</a>s on 16 April. Among the pigeons was <a href="Cher%20Ami">Cher Ami</a>—the only bird sent out by the <a href="Lost%20Battalion%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Lost Battalion</a> that was able to get a message through—and 100 captured German pigeons. Cher Ami had received the French <a href="Croix%20de%20Guerre">Croix de Guerre with Palm</a> and had been recommended for the U.S. Army <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a> by General <a href="John%20J.%20Pershing">John J. Pershing</a>.
"Ohioan" docked at New York on 22 May on her next voyage with a portion of the 328th Infantry Regiment of the <a href="82nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 82nd Infantry Division</a>. One of the members of the unit was Sergeant <a href="Alvin%20C.%20York">Alvin C. York</a>, who had led an attack on a German machine gun nest during the <a href="Meuse-Argonne%20Offensive">Meuse-Argonne Offensive</a> and captured 132 German officers and men. York had been honored with the U.S. <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> and the French Croix de Guerre with Palm (among other awards), both of which he wore on his coat on arrival at New York. After "Ohioan" docked, York held a well-attended press conference on board.

On 20 June, "Ohioan" returned another load of troops that included Base Hospital 98, and the 20th Engineers. By the time "Ohioan" had completed her sixth and final trooping voyage on 16 September 1919, "Ohioan" had carried home 8,383 healthy and wounded men. USS "Ohioan" was decommissioned on 6 October 1919, and returned to American-Hawaiian.

"Ohioan" resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Although the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by that time, "Ohioan" continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal relatively uneventfully for the next 17 years. On 23 November 1933, "Ohioan" collided with in the <a href="Ambrose%20Channel">Ambrose Channel</a>. She was consequently beached near the <a href="West%20Bank%20Light">West Bank Light</a>. "Ohioan" was refloated on 26 November.

In early morning hours of 8 October 1936, "Ohioan" ran aground near <a href="Seal%20Rock%20%28San%20Francisco%20County%2C%20California%29">Seal Rock</a> on the south shore of the <a href="Golden%20Gate">Golden Gate</a>, just outside <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>. The ship, sailing in a dense fog, strayed too close to shore and grounded on the rocks, sending a shower of sparks that lit up the night. When the fog cleared later in the morning, the ship was firmly seated on the rocks at the base of a cliff, and some from the mainland. <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">Coast Guardsmen</a> on shore attached three lines to the ship and set up a <a href="breeches%20buoy">breeches buoy</a> to take off the <a href="harbor%20pilot">harbor pilot</a>, but the crew stayed on board the ship in hopes that the high tide would free her from the rocky perch. As word of the shipwreck spread, spectators clambered over the cliff to get a view of the scene; one man died from a heart attack and two women broke ankles in separate falls. Newsboys soon arrived on the scene, selling newspapers telling of "Ohioan"s woe within sight of the stranded ship. Policemen were called out to keep order as the crowd grew into the thousands.

The next day, as the seas battered the ship and drove her farther on the rocks, two Coast Guard boats took 31 men from the ship. American-Hawaiian announced that a Los Angeles salvage firm had been hired to retrieve the cargo, which included explosives and oil. Two heavy-duty electric pumps were lowered to the ship via the breeches buoy, and plans were drawn up for connecting them to the San Francisco municipal electric system in order to pump out the ship.
The crowds of onlookers continued to watch as salvage efforts progressed; a 75-year-old woman from <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland</a> fell down the embankment while watching the action on 13 October. The mayor of San Francisco, <a href="Angelo%20Joseph%20Rossi">Angelo J. Rossi</a>, rode the breeches buoy to the ship and toured it for 45 minutes on 19 October. On 22 October, the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" ran an <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> story saying that marine experts were considering the use of a method first patented by <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> in May 1849 in order to re-float the stranded ship. All efforts were unsuccessful, and by 31 October, American-Hawaiian placed an advertisement in the "Los Angeles Times" requesting bids for the purchase of the ship and her cargo "as and where she now lies ... on the rocks near Point Lobos, San Francisco". E. J. Mitchell was the winning bidder, securing rights to the ship and its cargo for $2,800.

In March 1937, five months after the wreck, the hulk of "Ohioan"—still aground near Seal Rock—caught fire when a watchman aboard the ship attempted to burn some meat in a refrigerator. The flames died out before reaching the explosives that remained aboard the wreck. A Pacific storm in December the same year caused the hulk of "Ohioan" to break in two. By 1939, only remnants of some of "Ohioan"s rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.

Author Mark Ellis Thomas suggests that English poet and novelist <a href="Malcolm%20Lowry">Malcolm Lowry</a> may have been inspired by the wreck of "Ohioan" in his poem "In Tempest's Tavern". One excerpt from the poem refers to "The "Ohio" smoking in Frisco on a sharp pen / Of rock". At the time of "Ohioan"s grounding, Lowry was in San Diego, preparing to sail to <a href="Acapulco">Acapulco</a>.
