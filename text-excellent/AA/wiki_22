W. E. B. Du Bois

William Edward Burghardt Du Bois ( ; February 23, 1868 – August 27, 1963) was an American <a href="sociology">sociologist</a>, <a href="historian">historian</a>, <a href="civil%20rights%20activist">civil rights activist</a>, <a href="Pan-Africanism">Pan-Africanist</a>, author, writer and editor. Born in <a href="Great%20Barrington%2C%20Massachusetts">Great Barrington, Massachusetts</a>, Du Bois grew up in a relatively tolerant and <a href="racial%20integration">integrated</a> community, and after completing graduate work at the <a href="University%20of%20Berlin">University of Berlin</a> and <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a>, where he was the first <a href="African%20American">African American</a> to earn a <a href="doctorate">doctorate</a>, he became a professor of history, sociology and economics at <a href="Atlanta%20University">Atlanta University</a>. Du Bois was one of the founders of the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP) in 1909.

Before that, Du Bois had risen to national prominence as the leader of the <a href="Niagara%20Movement">Niagara Movement</a>, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. Du Bois and his supporters opposed the <a href="Atlanta%20compromise">Atlanta compromise</a>, an agreement crafted by <a href="Booker%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BT.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a> which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, Du Bois insisted on full civil rights and increased political representation, which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the <a href="Talented%20Tenth">Talented Tenth</a> and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.

<a href="Racism">Racism</a> was the main target of Du Bois's polemics, and he strongly protested against <a href="Lynching%20in%20the%20United%20States">lynching</a>, <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a>, and <a href="Racism%20in%20the%20United%20States">discrimination</a> in education and employment. His cause included people of color everywhere, particularly Africans and Asians in colonies. He was a proponent of Pan-Africanism and helped organize several <a href="Pan-African%20Congress">Pan-African Congress</a>es to fight for the independence of African colonies from European powers. Du Bois made several trips to Europe, Africa and Asia. After World War I, he surveyed the experiences of American <a href="Military%20history%20of%20African%20Americans%23World%20War%20I">black soldiers in France</a> and documented widespread prejudice in the United States military.

Du Bois was a prolific author. His collection of essays, "<a href="The%20Souls%20of%20Black%20Folk">The Souls of Black Folk</a>", was a seminal work in <a href="African-American%20literature">African-American literature</a>; and his 1935 magnum opus, "<a href="Black%20Reconstruction">Black Reconstruction in America</a>", challenged the prevailing orthodoxy that blacks were responsible for the failures of the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction Era</a>. Borrowing a phrase from <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>, he popularized the use of the term <a href="color%20line%20%28racism%29">color line</a> to represent the injustice of the <a href="separate%20but%20equal">separate but equal</a> doctrine prevalent in American social and political life. He opens "The Souls of Black Folk" with the central thesis of much of his life's work: "The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line."

He wrote one of the first scientific treatises in the field of American sociology, and he published three autobiographies, each of which contains essays on sociology, politics and history. In his role as editor of the NAACP's journal "<a href="The%20Crisis">The Crisis</a>", he published many influential pieces. Du Bois believed that <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a> was a primary cause of racism, and he was generally sympathetic to <a href="socialism">socialist</a> causes throughout his life. He was an ardent peace activist and advocated <a href="nuclear%20disarmament">nuclear disarmament</a>. The United States' <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act</a>, embodying many of the reforms for which Du Bois had campaigned his entire life, was enacted a year after his death.

William Edward Burghardt Du Bois was born on February 23, 1868, in <a href="Great%20Barrington%2C%20Massachusetts">Great Barrington, Massachusetts</a>, to Alfred and Mary Silvina (née Burghardt) Du Bois. Mary Silvina Burghardt's family was part of the very small <a href="free%20black">free black</a> population of Great Barrington and had long owned land in the state. She was descended from <a href="Dutch%20Americans">Dutch</a>, <a href="African%20diaspora">African</a> and <a href="English%20Americans">English</a> ancestors. William Du Bois's maternal great-great-grandfather was Tom Burghardt, a <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20colonial%20United%20States">slave</a> (born in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a> around 1730) who was held by the Dutch colonist Conraed Burghardt. Tom briefly served in the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, which may have been how he gained his freedom during the late 18th century. His son Jack Burghardt was the father of Othello Burghardt, who in turn was the father of Mary Silvina Burghardt.

William Du Bois claimed <a href="Elizabeth%20Freeman">Elizabeth Freeman</a> as his relative; he wrote that she had married his great-grandfather Jack Burghardt. But Freeman was 20 years older than Burghardt, and no record of such a marriage has been found. It may have been Freeman's daughter, Betsy Humphrey, who married Burghardt after her first husband, Jonah Humphrey, left the area "around 1811", and after Burghardt's first wife died ( 1810). If so, Freeman would have been William Du Bois's step-great-great-grandmother. Anecdotal evidence supports Humphrey's marrying Burghardt; a close relationship of some form is likely.

William Du Bois's paternal great-grandfather was James Du Bois of <a href="Poughkeepsie%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">Poughkeepsie, New York</a>, an ethnic <a href="French-American">French-American</a> of <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> origin who fathered several children with slave women. One of James' <a href="mixed-race">mixed-race</a> sons was Alexander, who was born on <a href="Long%20Cay">Long Cay</a> in <a href="the%20Bahamas">the Bahamas</a> in 1803; in 1810 he immigrated to the United States with his father. Alexander Du Bois traveled and worked in <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>, where he fathered a son, Alfred, with a mistress. Alexander returned to Connecticut, leaving Alfred in Haiti with his mother.

Sometime before 1860, Alfred Du Bois immigrated to the United States, settling in Massachusetts. He married Mary Silvina Burghardt on February 5, 1867, in <a href="Housatonic%2C%20Massachusetts">Housatonic</a>. Alfred left Mary in 1870, two years after their son William was born. Mary Du Bois moved with her son back to her parents' house in Great Barrington, and they lived there until he was five. She worked to support her family (receiving some assistance from her brother and neighbors), until she suffered a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> in the early 1880s. She died in 1885.

Great Barrington had a majority <a href="European%20American">European American</a> community, who generally treated Du Bois well. He attended the local integrated public school and played with white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism which he felt as a fatherless child and the experience of being a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led him to believe that he could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's <a href="Searles%20High%20School%20%28Great%20Barrington%2C%20Massachusetts%29">Searles High School</a>. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the <a href="First%20Congregational%20Church%20of%20Great%20Barrington">First Congregational Church of Great Barrington</a>, raised the money for his tuition.

Relying on money donated by neighbors, Du Bois attended <a href="Fisk%20University">Fisk University</a>, a <a href="historically%20black%20college">historically black college</a> in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, from 1885 to 1888. His travel to and residency in the South was Du Bois's first experience with Southern racism, which at the time encompassed <a href="Jim%20Crow">Jim Crow</a> laws, bigotry, suppression of black voting, and <a href="Lynching%20in%20the%20United%20States">lynchings</a>; the lattermost reached a peak in the next decade. After receiving a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a> from Fisk, he attended <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a> (which did not accept course credits from Fisk) from 1888 to 1890, where he was strongly influenced by his professor <a href="William%20James">William James</a>, prominent in American philosophy. Du Bois paid his way through three years at Harvard with money from summer jobs, an inheritance, scholarships, and loans from friends. In 1890, Harvard awarded Du Bois his second bachelor's degree, "<a href="Latin%20honors">cum laude</a>", in history. In 1891, Du Bois received a scholarship to attend the sociology graduate school at Harvard.

In 1892, Du Bois received a fellowship from the <a href="Slater%20Fund">John F. Slater Fund for the Education of Freedmen</a> to attend the <a href="University%20of%20Berlin">University of Berlin</a> for graduate work. While a student in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, he traveled extensively throughout Europe. He came of age intellectually in the German capital while studying with some of that nation's most prominent <a href="social%20scientist">social scientist</a>s, including <a href="Gustav%20von%20Schmoller">Gustav von Schmoller</a>, <a href="Adolph%20Wagner">Adolph Wagner</a>, and <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Treitschke">Heinrich von Treitschke</a>. After returning from Europe, Du Bois completed his graduate studies; in 1895 he was the first African American to earn a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> from Harvard University.

In the summer of 1894, Du Bois received several job offers, including one from the prestigious <a href="Tuskegee%20Institute">Tuskegee Institute</a>; he accepted a teaching job at <a href="Wilberforce%20University">Wilberforce University</a> in Ohio. At Wilberforce, Du Bois was strongly influenced by <a href="Alexander%20Crummell">Alexander Crummell</a>, who believed that ideas and morals are necessary tools to effect social change. While at Wilberforce, Du Bois married Nina Gomer, one of his students, on May 12, 1896.

After two years at Wilberforce, Du Bois accepted a one-year research job from the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> as an "assistant in sociology" in the summer of 1896. He performed sociological field research in Philadelphia's African-American neighborhoods, research which formed the foundation for his landmark study, "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Negro">The Philadelphia Negro</a>", published in 1899 while he was teaching at <a href="Atlanta%20University">Atlanta University</a>. It was the first case study of a black community in the United States. By the 1890s, Philadelphia's black neighborhoods had a negative reputation in terms of crime, poverty, and mortality. Du Bois's book undermined the stereotypes with empirical evidence and shaped his approach to segregation and its negative impact on black lives and reputations. The results led Du Bois to realize that racial integration was the key to democratic equality in American cities.

While taking part in the <a href="American%20Negro%20Academy">American Negro Academy</a> (ANA) in 1897, Du Bois presented a paper in which he rejected <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>'s plea for black Americans to integrate into white society. He wrote: "we are Negroes, members of a vast historic race that from the very dawn of creation has slept, but half awakening in the dark forests of its African fatherland". In the August 1897 issue of "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic Monthly</a>", Du Bois published "Strivings of the Negro People", his first work aimed at the general public, in which he enlarged upon his thesis that African Americans should embrace their African heritage while contributing to American society.

In July 1897, Du Bois left Philadelphia and took a professorship in history and economics at the historically black <a href="Atlanta%20University">Atlanta University</a> in Georgia. His first major academic work was his book "The Philadelphia Negro" (1899), a detailed and comprehensive sociological study of the African-American people of Philadelphia, based on the field work he did in 1896–1897. The work was a breakthrough in scholarship because it was the first scientific study of African Americans and a major contribution to early scientific sociology in the U.S. In the study, Du Bois coined the phrase "the submerged tenth" to describe the black underclass. Later in 1903 he popularized the term, the "<a href="The%20Talented%20Tenth">Talented Tenth</a>", applied to society's elite class. Du Bois's terminology reflected his opinion that the elite of a nation, both black and white, were critical to achievements in culture and progress. Du Bois wrote in this period in a dismissive way of the underclass, describing them as "lazy" or "unreliable", but – in contrast to other scholars – he attributed many of their societal problems to the ravages of slavery.

Du Bois's output at Atlanta University was prodigious, in spite of a limited budget: he produced numerous social science papers and annually hosted the <a href="Atlanta%20Conference%20of%20Negro%20Problems">Atlanta Conference of Negro Problems</a>. Du Bois also received grants from the U.S. government to prepare reports about African-American workforce and culture. His students considered him to be a brilliant, but aloof and strict, teacher.

In 1900 Du Bois attended the <a href="First%20Pan-African%20Conference">First Pan-African Conference</a>, held in <a href="London">London</a> from July 23 to 25. (This was just before the <a href="Paris%20Exhibition%20of%201900">Paris Exhibition of 1900</a> "to allow tourists of African descent to attend both events".) It was organized by men from the Caribbean: Haitians <a href="Ant%C3%A9nor%20Firmin">Anténor Firmin</a> and <a href="B%C3%A9nito%20Sylvain">Bénito Sylvain</a> and <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidadian</a> barrister <a href="Henry%20Sylvester%20Williams">Henry Sylvester Williams</a>. Du Bois played a leading role in drafting a letter ("Address to the Nations of the World") to European leaders appealing to them to struggle against racism, to grant colonies in Africa and the West Indies the right to <a href="self-government">self-government</a> and to demand political and other rights for African Americans. By this time, southern states were passing new laws and constitutions to <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era">disfranchise</a> most African Americans, an exclusion from the political system that lasted into the 1960s.

At the conclusion of the conference, delegates unanimously adopted the "Address to the Nations of the World", and sent it to various heads of state where people of African descent were living and suffering oppression. The address implored the United States and the imperial European nations to "acknowledge and protect the rights of people of African descent" and to respect the integrity and independence of "the free Negro States of <a href="Ethiopia">Abyssinia</a>, <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>, etc." It was signed by Bishop <a href="Alexander%20Walters">Alexander Walters</a> (President of the Pan-African Association), the Canadian Rev. Henry B. Brown (Vice-President), Williams (General Secretary) and Du Bois (Chairman of the Committee on the Address). The address included Du Bois's observation, "The problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the <a href="Color%20line%20%28civil%20rights%20issue%29">colour-line</a>." He used this again three years later in the "Forethought" of his book, "The Souls of Black Folk" (1903).

In the first decade of the new century, Du Bois emerged as a spokesperson for his race, second only to <a href="Booker%20T.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a>. Washington was the director of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and wielded tremendous influence within the African-American and white communities. Washington was the architect of the <a href="Atlanta%20Compromise">Atlanta Compromise</a>, an unwritten deal he struck in 1895 with Southern white leaders who dominated state governments after Reconstruction. Essentially the agreement provided that Southern blacks, who overwhelmingly lived in rural communities, would submit to the current discrimination, segregation, <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era">disenfranchisement</a>, and non-unionized employment; that Southern whites would permit blacks to receive a basic education, some economic opportunities, and justice within the legal system; and that Northern whites would invest in Southern enterprises and fund black educational charities.

Despite initially sending congratulations to Washington for his <a href="Atlanta%20Exposition%20Speech">Atlanta Exposition Speech</a>, Du Bois later came to oppose Washington's plan, along with many other African Americans, including <a href="Archibald%20Grimk%C3%A9">Archibald H. Grimke</a>, <a href="Kelly%20Miller%20%28scientist%29">Kelly Miller</a>, <a href="James%20Weldon%20Johnson">James Weldon Johnson</a> and <a href="Paul%20Laurence%20Dunbar">Paul Laurence Dunbar</a> – representatives of the class of educated blacks that Du Bois would later call the "<a href="The%20Talented%20Tenth">talented tenth</a>". Du Bois felt that African Americans should fight for equal rights and higher opportunities, rather than passively submit to the segregation and discrimination of Washington's Atlanta Compromise.

Du Bois was inspired to greater activism by the lynching of <a href="Sam%20Hose">Sam Hose</a>, which occurred near Atlanta in 1899. Hose was tortured, burned and hung by a mob of two thousand whites. When walking through Atlanta to discuss the lynching with newspaper editor <a href="Joel%20Chandler%20Harris">Joel Chandler Harris</a>, Du Bois encountered Hose's burned knuckles in a storefront display. The episode stunned Du Bois, and he resolved that "one could not be a calm, cool, and detached scientist while Negroes were lynched, murdered, and starved". Du Bois realized that "the cure wasn't simply telling people the truth, it was inducing them to act on the truth".

In 1901, Du Bois wrote a review critical of Washington's autobiography "<a href="Up%20from%20Slavery">Up from Slavery</a>", which he later expanded and published to a wider audience as the essay "Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others" in "<a href="The%20Souls%20of%20Black%20Folk">The Souls of Black Folk</a>". Later in life, Du Bois regretted having been critical of Washington in those essays. One of the contrasts between the two leaders was their approach to education: Washington felt that African-American schools should focus primarily on <a href="Vocational%20education">industrial education topics</a> such as agricultural and mechanical skills, to prepare southern blacks for the opportunities in the rural areas where most lived. Du Bois felt that black schools should focus more on <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a> and academic curriculum (including the classics, arts, and humanities), because liberal arts were required to develop a leadership elite. However, as sociologist <a href="E.%20Franklin%20Frazier">E. Franklin Frazier</a> and economists <a href="Gunnar%20Myrdal">Gunnar Myrdal</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Sowell">Thomas Sowell</a> have argued, such disagreement over education was a minor point of difference between Washington and Du Bois; both men acknowledged the importance of the form of education that the other emphasized. Sowell has also argued that, despite genuine disagreements between the two leaders, the supposed animosity between Washington and Du Bois actually formed among their followers, not between Washington and Du Bois themselves. Du Bois himself also made this observation in an interview published in "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic Monthly</a>" in November 1965.

In 1905, Du Bois and several other African-American civil rights activists – including <a href="Fredrick%20L.%20McGhee">Fredrick L. McGhee</a>, <a href="Jesse%20Max%20Barber">Jesse Max Barber</a> and <a href="William%20Monroe%20Trotter">William Monroe Trotter</a> – met in Canada, near <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a>. There they wrote a declaration of principles opposing the Atlanta Compromise, and incorporated as the <a href="Niagara%20Movement">Niagara Movement</a> in 1906.

Du Bois and the other "Niagarites" wanted to publicize their ideals to other African Americans, but most black periodicals were owned by publishers sympathetic to Washington. Du Bois bought a printing press and started publishing "Moon Illustrated Weekly" in December 1905. It was the first African-American illustrated weekly, and Du Bois used it to attack Washington's positions, but the magazine lasted only for about eight months. Du Bois soon founded and edited another vehicle for his polemics, "", which debuted in 1907. <a href="Freeman%20H.%20M.%20Murray">Freeman H. M. Murray</a> and <a href="Lafayette%20M.%20Hershaw">Lafayette M. Hershaw</a> served as "The Horizon"'s co-editors.

The Niagarites held a second conference in August 1906, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of abolitionist <a href="John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a>'s birth, at the West Virginia site of Brown's <a href="John%20Brown%27s%20raid%20on%20Harpers%20Ferry">raid on Harper's Ferry</a>. <a href="Reverdy%20C.%20Ransom">Reverdy C. Ransom</a> spoke and addressed the fact that Washington's primary goal was to prepare blacks for employment in their current society: "Today, two classes of Negroes, ... are standing at the parting of the ways. The one counsels patient submission to our present humiliations and degradations; ... The other class believe that it should not submit to being humiliated, degraded, and remanded to an inferior place ... it does not believe in bartering its manhood for the sake of gain."

In an effort to portray the genius and humanity of the black race, Du Bois published "The Souls of Black Folk" (1903), a collection of 14 essays. James Weldon Johnson said the book's effect on African Americans was comparable to that of "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>". The introduction famously proclaimed that "the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line". Each chapter begins with two epigraphs – one from a white poet, and one from a black spiritual – to demonstrate intellectual and cultural parity between black and white cultures. A major theme of the work was the <a href="double%20consciousness">double consciousness</a> faced by African Americans: being both American and black. This was a unique identity which, according to Du Bois, had been a handicap in the past, but could be a strength in the future: "Henceforth, the destiny of the race could be conceived as leading neither to assimilation nor separatism but to proud, enduring hyphenation."

Jonathon S. Kahn in "Divine Discontent: The Religious Imagination of Du Bois" shows how Du Bois, in his "The Souls of Black Folk", represents an exemplary text of pragmatic <a href="religious%20naturalism">religious naturalism</a>. On page 12 Kahn writes: "Du Bois needs to be understood as an African American pragmatic religious naturalist. By this I mean that, like Du Bois the American traditional pragmatic religious naturalism, which runs through William James, <a href="George%20Santayana">George Santayana</a> and <a href="John%20Dewey">John Dewey</a>, seeks religion without <a href="metaphysics">metaphysical</a> foundations." Kahn's interpretation of religious naturalism is very broad but he relates it to specific thinkers. Du Bois's anti-metaphysical viewpoint places him in the sphere of religious naturalism as typified by William James and others.

Two calamities in the autumn of 1906 shocked African Americans, and they contributed to strengthening support for Du Bois's struggle for civil rights to prevail over Booker T. Washington's <a href="Atlanta%20Compromise">accommodationism</a>. First, President <a href="Teddy%20Roosevelt">Teddy Roosevelt</a> dishonorably discharged 167 black soldiers because they were accused of crimes as a result of the <a href="Brownsville%20Affair">Brownsville Affair</a>. Many of the discharged soldiers had served for 20 years and were near retirement. Second, in September, <a href="Atlanta%20Race%20Riot">riots broke out in Atlanta</a>, precipitated by unfounded allegations of black men assaulting white women. This was a catalyst for racial tensions based on a job shortage and employers playing black workers against white workers. Ten thousand whites rampaged through Atlanta, beating every black person they could find, resulting in over 25 deaths. In the aftermath of the 1906 violence, Du Bois urged blacks to withdraw their support from the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>, because Republicans Roosevelt and <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a> did not sufficiently support blacks. Most African Americans had been loyal to the Republican Party since the time of <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>.

Du Bois wrote the essay, "A Litany at Atlanta", which asserted that the riot demonstrated that the Atlanta Compromise was a failure. Despite upholding their end of the bargain, blacks had failed to receive legal justice in the South. Historian David Levering Lewis has written that the Compromise no longer held because white patrician planters, who took a paternalistic role, had been replaced by aggressive businessmen who were willing to pit blacks against whites. These two calamities were watershed events for the African-American community, marking the ascendancy of Du Bois's vision of equal rights.

In addition to writing editorials, Du Bois continued to produce scholarly work at Atlanta University. In 1909, after five years of effort, he published a biography of abolitionist John Brown. It contained many insights, but also contained some factual errors. The work was strongly criticized by "<a href="The%20Nation">The Nation</a>", which was owned by <a href="Oswald%20Villard">Oswald Villard</a>, who was writing his own, competing biography of John Brown. Du Bois's work was largely ignored by white scholars. After publishing a piece in "<a href="Collier%27s">Collier's</a>" magazine warning of the end of "<a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacy</a>", Du Bois had difficulty getting pieces accepted by major periodicals. But he did continue to publish columns regularly in "The Horizon" magazine.

Du Bois was the first African American invited by the <a href="American%20Historical%20Association">American Historical Association</a> (AHA) to present a paper at their annual conference. He read his paper, "Reconstruction and Its Benefits," to an astounded audience at the AHA's December 1909 conference. The paper went against the mainstream historical view, promoted by the <a href="Dunning%20School">Dunning School</a> of scholars at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, that <a href="Reconstruction%20Era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a> was a disaster, caused by the ineptitude and sloth of blacks. To the contrary, Du Bois asserted that the brief period of African-American leadership in the South accomplished three important goals: democracy, free public schools, and new social welfare legislation. He asserted that it was the federal government's failure to manage the <a href="Freedmen%27s%20Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</a>, to distribute land, and to establish an educational system, that doomed African-American prospects in the South. When Du Bois submitted the paper for publication a few months later in the "<a href="American%20Historical%20Review">American Historical Review</a>", he asked that the word Negro be capitalized. The editor, <a href="J.%20Franklin%20Jameson">J. Franklin Jameson</a>, refused, and published the paper without the capitalization. The paper was mostly ignored by white historians. Du Bois later developed his paper as his ground-breaking 1935 book, "<a href="Black%20Reconstruction">Black Reconstruction</a>," which marshaled extensive facts to support his assertions. The AHA did not invite another African-American speaker until 1940.
In May 1909, Du Bois attended the <a href="National%20Negro%20Conference">National Negro Conference</a> in New York. The meeting led to the creation of the <a href="National%20Negro%20Committee">National Negro Committee</a>, chaired by Oswald Villard, and dedicated to campaigning for civil rights, equal voting rights, and equal educational opportunities. The following spring, in 1910, at the second National Negro Conference, the attendees created the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP). At Du Bois's suggestion, the word "colored", rather than "black", was used to include "dark skinned people everywhere". Dozens of civil rights supporters, black and white, participated in the founding, but most executive officers were white, including <a href="Mary%20Ovington">Mary Ovington</a>, <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Russell">Charles Edward Russell</a>, <a href="William%20English%20Walling">William English Walling</a>, and its first president, <a href="Moorfield%20Storey">Moorfield Storey</a>.

NAACP leaders offered Du Bois the position of Director of Publicity and Research. He accepted the job in the summer of 1910, and moved to New York after resigning from Atlanta University. His primary duty was editing the NAACP's monthly magazine, which he named "<a href="The%20Crisis">The Crisis</a>". The first issue appeared in November 1910, and Du Bois pronounced that its aim was to set out "those facts and arguments which show the danger of race prejudice, particularly as manifested today toward colored people". The journal was phenomenally successful, and its circulation would reach 100,000 in 1920. Typical articles in the early editions included one that inveighed against the dishonesty and parochialism of black churches, and one that discussed the Afrocentric origins of Egyptian civilization.

An important Du Bois editorial from 1911 helped initiate a nationwide push to induce the Federal government to outlaw lynching. Du Bois, employing the sarcasm he frequently used, commented on a lynching in Pennsylvania: "The point is he was black. Blackness must be punished. Blackness is the crime of crimes ... It is therefore necessary, as every white scoundrel in the nation knows, to let slip no opportunity of punishing this crime of crimes. Of course if possible, the pretext should be great and overwhelming – some awful stunning crime, made even more horrible by the reporters' imagination. Failing this, mere murder, arson, barn burning or impudence may do."

"The Crisis" carried editorials by Du Bois that supported the ideals of unionized labor but excoriated the racism demonstrated by its leaders, who systematically excluded blacks from membership. Du Bois also supported the principles of the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist Party</a> (he was briefly a member of the party from 1910 to 1912), but he denounced the racism demonstrated by some socialist leaders. Frustrated by Republican president Taft's failure to address widespread lynching, Du Bois endorsed Democratic candidate <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> in the 1912 presidential race, in exchange for Wilson's promise to support black causes.

Throughout his writings, Du Bois supported women's rights, but he found it difficult to publicly endorse the <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's right-to-vote movement</a> because leaders of the <a href="suffragism">suffragism</a> movement refused to support his fight against racial injustice. A "Crisis" editorial from 1913 broached the taboo subject of <a href="interracial%20marriage">interracial marriage</a>: although Du Bois generally expected persons to marry within their race, he viewed the problem as a women's rights issue, because laws prohibited white men from marrying black women. Du Bois wrote "<a href="Anti-miscegenation%20laws%20in%20the%20United%20States">[anti-miscegenation] laws</a> leave the colored girls absolutely helpless for the lust of white men. It reduces colored women in the eyes of the law to the position of dogs. As low as the white girl falls, she can compel her seducer to marry her ... We must kill [anti-miscegenation laws] not because we are anxious to marry the white men's sisters, but because we are determined that white men will leave our sisters alone."

During the years 1915 and 1916, some leaders of the NAACP – disturbed by financial losses at "The Crisis", and worried about the inflammatory rhetoric of some of its essays – attempted to oust Du Bois from his editorial position. Du Bois and his supporters prevailed, and he continued in his role as editor. In a 1919 column titled "The True Brownies", he announced the creation of "<a href="The%20Brownies%27%20Book">The Brownies' Book</a>", the first magazine published for African-American children and youth, which he founded with <a href="Augustus%20Granville%20Dill">Augustus Granville Dill</a> and <a href="Jessie%20Redmon%20Fauset">Jessie Redmon Fauset</a>.

The 1910s were a productive time for Du Bois. In 1911 he attended the <a href="First%20Universal%20Races%20Congress">First Universal Races Congress</a> in London and he published his first novel, "The Quest of the Silver Fleece." Two years later, Du Bois wrote, produced, and directed a pageant for the stage, "<a href="The%20Star%20of%20Ethiopia">The Star of Ethiopia</a>". In 1915, Du Bois published "<a href="The%20Negro">The Negro</a>", a general history of black Africans, and the first of its kind in English. The book rebutted claims of African inferiority, and would come to serve as the basis of much Afrocentric historiography in the 20th century. "The Negro" predicted unity and solidarity for colored people around the world, and it influenced many who supported the Pan-African movement.

In 1915, "The Atlantic Monthly" carried an essay by Du Bois, "The African Roots of the War", which consolidated Du Bois's ideas on capitalism and race. In it, he argued that the <a href="scramble%20for%20Africa">scramble for Africa</a> was at the root of World War I. He also anticipated later Communist doctrine, by suggesting that wealthy capitalists had pacified white workers by giving them just enough wealth to prevent them from revolting, and by threatening them with competition by the lower-cost labor of colored workers.

Du Bois used his influential role in the NAACP to oppose a variety of racist incidents. When the silent film "<a href="The%20Birth%20of%20a%20Nation">The Birth of a Nation</a>" premiered in 1915, Du Bois and the NAACP led the fight to ban the movie, because of its racist portrayal of blacks as brutish and lustful. The fight was not successful, and possibly contributed to the film's fame, but the publicity drew many new supporters to the NAACP.

The private sector was not the only source of racism: under President Wilson, the plight of African Americans in government jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted whites-only employment practices, the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and the immigration service prohibited the immigration of persons of African ancestry. Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about Wilson's failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice for blacks.

"The Crisis" continued to wage a campaign against lynching. In 1915, it published an article with a year-by-year tabulation of 2,732 lynchings from 1884 to 1914. The April 1916 edition covered the group lynching of six African Americans in <a href="Lee%20County%2C%20Georgia">Lee County, Georgia</a>. Later in 1916, the "Waco Horror" article covered the <a href="lynching%20of%20Jesse%20Washington">lynching of Jesse Washington</a>, a mentally impaired 17-year-old African American. The article broke new ground by utilizing undercover reporting to expose the conduct of local whites in <a href="Waco%2C%20Texas">Waco, Texas</a>.

The early 20th century was the era of the <a href="Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29">Great Migration</a> of blacks from the Southern United States to the Northeast, Midwest and West. Du Bois wrote an editorial supporting the Great Migration, because he felt it would help blacks escape Southern racism, find economic opportunities, and assimilate into American society.

Also in the 1910s the <a href="Eugenics%20in%20the%20United%20States">American eugenics movement</a> was in its infancy, and many leading eugenicists were openly racist, defining Blacks as "a lower race". Du Bois opposed this view as an unscientific aberration, but still maintained the basic principle of eugenics: that different persons have different inborn characteristics that make them more or less suited for specific kinds of employment, and that by encouraging the most talented members of all races to procreate would better the "stocks" of humanity.

As the United States prepared to enter <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, <a href="Joel%20Elias%20Spingarn">Joel Spingarn</a>, established a camp to train African Americans to serve as officers in the United States military. The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt that African Americans should not participate in what they considered a white man's war. Du Bois supported Spingarn's training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its few black officers, <a href="Charles%20Young%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Charles Young</a>, on a pretense of ill health. The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions for blacks, but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, conditioned to taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks that came from the camp. Over 700,000 blacks enlisted on the first day of the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.

After the <a href="East%20St.%20Louis%20riots">East St. Louis riots</a> occurred in the summer of 1917, Du Bois traveled to St. Louis to report on the riots. Between 40 and 250 African Americans were massacred by whites, primarily due to resentment caused by St. Louis industry hiring blacks to replace striking white workers. Du Bois's reporting resulted in an article "The Massacre of East St. Louis", published in the September issue of "The Crisis," which contained photographs and interviews detailing the violence. Historian <a href="David%20Levering%20Lewis">David Levering Lewis</a> concluded that Du Bois distorted some of the facts in order to increase the propaganda value of the article. To publicly demonstrate the black community's outrage over the riots, Du Bois organized the <a href="Silent%20Parade">Silent Parade</a>, a march of around 9,000 African Americans down New York City's <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a>, the first parade of its kind in New York, and the second instance of blacks publicly demonstrating for civil rights.

The <a href="Houston%20riot%20of%201917">Houston riot of 1917</a> disturbed Du Bois and was a major setback to efforts to permit African Americans to become military officers. The riot began after Houston police arrested and beat two black soldiers; in response, over 100 black soldiers took to the streets of Houston and killed 16 whites. A military court martial was held, and 19 of the soldiers were hung, and 67 others were imprisoned. In spite of the Houston riot, Du Bois and others successfully pressed the Army to accept the officers trained at Spingarn's camp, resulting in over 600 black officers joining the Army in October 1917.

Federal officials, concerned about subversive viewpoints expressed by NAACP leaders, attempted to frighten the NAACP by threatening it with investigations. Du Bois was not intimidated, and in 1918 he predicted that World War I would lead to an overthrow of the European colonial system and to the "liberation" of colored people worldwide – in China, in India, and especially in America. NAACP chairman Joel Spingarn was enthusiastic about the war, and he persuaded Du Bois to consider an officer's commission in the Army, contingent on Du Bois writing an editorial repudiating his anti-war stance. Du Bois accepted this bargain and wrote the pro-war "Close Ranks" editorial in June 1918 and soon thereafter he received a commission in the Army. Many black leaders, who wanted to leverage the war to gain civil rights for African Americans, criticized Du Bois for his sudden reversal. Southern officers in Du Bois's unit objected to his presence, and his commission was withdrawn.

When the war ended, Du Bois traveled to Europe in 1919 to attend the first <a href="Pan-African%20Congress">Pan-African Congress</a> and to interview African-American soldiers for a planned book on their experiences in World War I. He was trailed by U.S. agents who were searching for evidence of treasonous activities. Du Bois discovered that the vast majority of black American soldiers were relegated to menial labor as <a href="stevedore">stevedore</a>s and laborers. Some units were armed, and one in particular, the <a href="92nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">92nd Division</a> (the Buffalo soldiers), engaged in combat. Du Bois discovered widespread racism in the Army, and concluded that the Army command discouraged African Americans from joining the Army, discredited the accomplishments of black soldiers, and promoted bigotry.

After returning from Europe, Du Bois was more determined than ever to gain equal rights for African Americans. Black soldiers returning from overseas felt a new sense of power and worth, and were representative of an emerging attitude referred to as the <a href="New%20Negro">New Negro</a>. In the editorial "Returning Soldiers" he wrote: "But, by the God of Heaven, we are cowards and jackasses if, now that the war is over, we do not marshal every ounce of our brain and brawn to fight a sterner, longer, more unbending battle against the forces of hell in our own land." Many blacks moved to northern cities in search of work, and some northern white workers resented the competition. This labor strife was one of the causes of the <a href="Red%20Summer%20of%201919">Red Summer of 1919</a>, a horrific series of <a href="race%20riots">race riots</a> across America, in which over 300 African Americans were killed in over 30 cities. Du Bois documented the atrocities in the pages of "The Crisis", culminating in the December publication of a gruesome photograph of a lynching that occurred during the Omaha, Nebraska race riot.

The most egregious episode during the Red Summer was a <a href="Elaine%20Race%20Riot">vicious attack on blacks</a> in <a href="Elaine%2C%20Arkansas">Elaine, Arkansas</a>, in which nearly 200 blacks were murdered. Reports coming out of the South blamed the blacks, alleging that they were conspiring to take over the government. Infuriated with the distortions, Du Bois published a letter in the "<a href="New%20York%20World">New York World</a>", claiming that the only crime the black <a href="sharecropper">sharecropper</a>s had committed was daring to challenge their white landlords by hiring an attorney to investigate contractual irregularities. Over 60 of the surviving blacks were arrested and tried for conspiracy, in the case known as "<a href="Moore%20v.%20Dempsey">Moore v. Dempsey</a>". Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense, which, six years later, resulted in a Supreme Court victory authored by <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%20Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a>. Although the victory had little immediate impact on justice for blacks in the South, it marked the first time the Federal government used the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">14th amendment</a> guarantee of <a href="due%20process">due process</a> to prevent states from shielding mob violence.

In 1920, Du Bois published "", the first of three autobiographies he would write. The "veil" was that which covered colored people around the world. In the book, he hoped to lift the veil and show white readers what life was like behind the veil, and how it distorted the viewpoints of those looking through it – in both directions. The book contained Du Bois's feminist essay, "The Damnation of Women", which was a tribute to the dignity and worth of women, particularly black women.

Concerned that textbooks used by African-American children ignored black history and culture, Du Bois created a monthly children's magazine, "The Brownies' Book". Initially published in 1920, it was aimed at black children, who Du Bois called "the children of the sun".

Du Bois traveled to Europe in 1921 to attend the second Pan-African Congress. The assembled black leaders from around the world issued the "London Resolutions" and established a Pan-African Association headquarters in Paris. Under Du Bois's guidance, the resolutions insisted on racial equality, and that Africa be ruled "by" Africans (not, as in the 1919 congress, with the "consent" of Africans). Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his "Manifesto To the League of Nations", which implored the newly formed <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests.

Another important African-American leader of the 1920s was <a href="Marcus%20Garvey">Marcus Garvey</a>, promoter of the <a href="Back-to-Africa%20movement">Back-to-Africa movement</a> and founder of the <a href="Universal%20Negro%20Improvement%20Association">Universal Negro Improvement Association</a> (UNIA). Garvey denounced Du Bois's efforts to achieve equality through integration, and instead endorsed racial separatism. Du Bois initially supported the concept of Garvey's <a href="Black%20Star%20Line">Black Star Line</a>, a shipping company that was intended to facilitate commerce within the African diaspora. But Du Bois later became concerned that Garvey was threatening the NAACP's efforts, leading Du Bois to describe him as fraudulent and reckless. Responding to Garvey's slogan "Africa for the Africans", Du Bois said that he supported that concept, but denounced Garvey's intention that Africa be ruled by African Americans.

Du Bois wrote a series of articles in "The Crisis" between 1922 and 1924 attacking Garvey's movement, calling him the "most dangerous enemy of the Negro race in America and the world." Du Bois and Garvey never made a serious attempt to collaborate, and their dispute was partly rooted in the desire of their respective organizations (NAACP and UNIA) to capture a larger portion of the available philanthropic funding.

Harvard's decision to ban blacks from its dormitories in 1921 was decried by Du Bois as an instance of a broad effort in the U.S. to renew "the Anglo-Saxon cult; the worship of the Nordic totem, the disfranchisement of Negro, Jew, Irishman, Italian, Hungarian, Asiatic and South Sea Islander – the world rule of Nordic white through brute force." When Du Bois sailed for Europe in 1923 for the third Pan-African Congress, the circulation of "The Crisis" had declined to 60,000 from its World War I high of 100,000, but it remained the preeminent periodical of the civil rights movement. <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">President Coolidge</a> designated Du Bois an "Envoy Extraordinary" to Liberia and – after the third congress concluded – Du Bois rode a German freighter from the Canary Islands to Africa, visiting <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> and <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>.

Du Bois frequently promoted African-American artistic creativity in his writings, and when the <a href="Harlem%20Renaissance">Harlem Renaissance</a> emerged in the mid-1920s, his article "A Negro Art Renaissance" celebrated the end of the long hiatus of blacks from creative endeavors. His enthusiasm for the Harlem Renaissance waned as he came to believe that many whites visited Harlem for voyeurism, not for genuine appreciation of black art. Du Bois insisted that artists recognize their moral responsibilities, writing that "a black artist is first of all a "black" artist." He was also concerned that black artists were not using their art to promote black causes, saying "I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda." By the end of 1926, he stopped employing "The Crisis" to support the arts.

When Du Bois became editor of "The Crisis" magazine in 1911, he joined the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist Party of America</a> on the advice of NAACP founders <a href="Mary%20Ovington">Mary Ovington</a>, <a href="William%20English%20Walling">William English Walling</a> and <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Russell">Charles Edward Russell</a>. However, he supported the Democrat <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> in the 1912 presidential campaign, a breach of the rules, and was forced to resign from the Socialist Party. In 1913, his support for Wilson was shaken when racial segregation in government hiring was reported. Du Bois remained "convinced that socialism was an excellent way of life, but I thought it might be reached by various methods."

Nine years after the 1917 <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>, Du Bois extended a trip to Europe to include a visit to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Du Bois was struck by the poverty and disorganization he encountered in the Soviet Union, yet was impressed by the intense labors of the officials and by the recognition given to workers. Although Du Bois was not yet familiar with the communist theories of <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> or <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, he concluded that <a href="socialism">socialism</a> may be a better path towards racial equality than capitalism.

Although Du Bois generally endorsed socialist principles, his politics were strictly pragmatic: in 1929, Du Bois endorsed Democrat <a href="Jimmy%20Walker">Jimmy Walker</a> for mayor of New York, rather than the socialist <a href="Norman%20Thomas">Norman Thomas</a>, believing that Walker could do more immediate good for blacks, even though Thomas' platform was more consistent with Du Bois's views. Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support back and forth between the Republican Party and the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>, induced by promises from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their promises.

A rivalry emerged in 1931 between the NAACP and the <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">Communist Party</a>, when the Communists responded quickly and effectively to support the <a href="Scottsboro%20Boys">Scottsboro Boys</a>, nine African-American youth arrested in 1931 in Alabama for rape. Du Bois and the NAACP felt that the case would not be beneficial to their cause, so they chose to let the Communist Party <a href="Scottsboro%20Boys%23Help%20from%20Communist%20Party%20and%20NAACP">organize the defense efforts</a>. Du Bois was impressed with the vast amount of publicity and funds the Communists devoted to the partially successful defense effort, and he came to suspect that the Communists were attempting to present their party to African Americans as a better solution than the NAACP. Responding to criticisms of the NAACP from the Communist Party, Du Bois wrote articles condemning the party, claiming that it unfairly attacked the NAACP, and that it failed to fully appreciate racism in the United States. The Communist leaders, in turn, accused Du Bois of being a "class enemy", and claimed that the NAACP leadership was an isolated elite, disconnected from the working-class blacks they ostensibly fought for.

Du Bois did not have a good working relationship with <a href="Walter%20Francis%20White">Walter Francis White</a>, president of the NAACP since 1931. That conflict, combined with the financial stresses of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, precipitated a power struggle over "The Crisis". Du Bois, concerned that his position as editor would be eliminated, resigned his job at "The Crisis" and accepted an academic position at Atlanta University in early 1933. The rift with the NAACP grew larger in 1934 when Du Bois reversed his stance on segregation, stating that "<a href="separate%20but%20equal">separate but equal</a>" was an acceptable goal for African Americans. The NAACP leadership was stunned, and asked Du Bois to retract his statement, but he refused, and the dispute led to Du Bois's resignation from the NAACP.

After arriving at his new professorship in Atlanta, Du Bois wrote a series of articles generally supportive of <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>. He was not a strong proponent of <a href="labor%20union">labor union</a>s or the Communist Party, but he felt that Marx's scientific explanation of society and the economy were useful for explaining the situation of African Americans in the United States. <a href="Marxism%20and%20religion">Marx's atheism</a> also struck a chord with Du Bois, who routinely criticized black churches for dulling blacks' sensitivity to racism. In his 1933 writings, Du Bois embraced socialism, but asserted that "[c]olored labor has no common ground with white labor", a controversial position that was rooted in Du Bois's dislike of American labor unions, which had systematically excluded blacks for decades. Du Bois did not support the Communist Party in the U.S. and did not vote for their candidate in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201932">1932 presidential election</a>, in spite of an African American on their <a href="Ticket%20%28election%29">ticket</a>.

Back in the world of academia, Du Bois was able to resume his study of Reconstruction, the topic of the 1910 paper that he presented to the American Historical Association. In 1935, he published his magnum opus, "Black Reconstruction in America". The book presented the thesis, in the words of the historian David Levering Lewis, that "black people, suddenly admitted to citizenship in an environment of feral hostility, displayed admirable volition and intelligence as well as the indolence and ignorance inherent in three centuries of bondage." Du Bois documented how black people were central figures in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> and <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a>, and also showed how they made alliances with white politicians. He provided evidence that the coalition governments established public education in the South, and many needed social service programs. The book also demonstrated the ways in which <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">black emancipation</a> – the crux of Reconstruction – promoted a radical restructuring of United States society, as well as how and why the country failed to continue support for <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> for blacks in the aftermath of Reconstruction.

The book's thesis ran counter to the <a href="Dunning%20School">orthodox interpretation of Reconstruction</a> maintained by white historians, and the book was virtually ignored by mainstream historians until the 1960s. Thereafter, however, it ignited a "revisionist" trend in the historiography of Reconstruction, which emphasized black people's search for freedom and the era's radical policy changes. By the 21st century, "Black Reconstruction" was widely perceived as "the foundational text of revisionist African American historiography."

In the final chapter of the book, "XIV. The Propaganda of History", Du Bois evokes his efforts at writing an article for the "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>" on the "history of the American Negro". After the editors had cut all reference to Reconstruction, he insisted that the following note appear in the entry: "White historians have ascribed the faults and failures of Reconstruction to Negro ignorance and corruption. But the Negro insists that it was Negro loyalty and the Negro vote alone that restored the South to the Union; established the new democracy, both for white and black, and instituted the public schools." The editors refused and, so, Du Bois withdrew his article.

In 1932, Du Bois was selected by several philanthropies – including the <a href="Phelps-Stokes%20Fund">Phelps-Stokes Fund</a>, the <a href="Carnegie%20Corporation">Carnegie Corporation</a>, and the <a href="General%20Education%20Board">General Education Board</a> – to be the managing editor for a proposed "Encyclopedia of the Negro", a work Du Bois had been contemplating for 30 years. After several years of planning and organizing, the philanthropies cancelled the project in 1938, because some board members believed that Du Bois was too biased to produce an objective encyclopedia.

Du Bois took a trip around the world in 1936, which included visits to <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, China and Japan. While in Germany, Du Bois remarked that he was treated with warmth and respect. After his return to the United States, he expressed his ambivalence about the Nazi regime. He admired how the Nazis had improved the <a href="The%20Great%20Depression%20in%20Germany">German economy</a>, but he was horrified by their <a href="Nuremberg%20Laws">treatment</a> of the <a href="Jewish%20people">Jewish people</a>, which he described as "an attack on civilization, comparable only to such horrors as the Spanish Inquisition and the African slave trade."

Following the 1905 Japanese victory in the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a>, Du Bois became impressed by the growing strength of <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Imperial Japan</a>. He considered the victory of Japan over <a href="Russian%20Empire">Tsarist Russia</a> as an example of colored peoples defeating white peoples. A representative of Japan's "Negro Propaganda Operations" traveled to the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, meeting with Du Bois and giving him a positive impression of Imperial Japan's racial policies. In 1936, the Japanese ambassador arranged a trip to Japan for Du Bois and a small group of <a href="academic">academic</a>s.

Du Bois opposed the U.S. intervention in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, particularly in the Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia. He was deeply disappointed by the US government's plan for African Americans in the armed forces: Blacks were limited to 5.8% of the force, and there were to be no African-American combat units – virtually the same restrictions as in World War I. With blacks threatening to shift their support to President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s Republican opponent in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201940">1940 election</a>, Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.
"<a href="Dusk%20of%20Dawn">Dusk of Dawn</a>", Du Bois's second autobiography, was published in 1940. The title refers to Du Bois's hope that African Americans were passing out of the darkness of racism into an era of greater equality. The work is part autobiography, part history, and part sociological treatise. Du Bois described the book as "the autobiography of a concept of race ... elucidated and magnified and doubtless distorted in the thoughts and deeds which were mine ... Thus for all time my life is significant for all lives of men."

In 1943, at the age of 76, Du Bois was abruptly fired from his position at Atlanta University by college president <a href="Rufus%20Clement">Rufus Clement</a>. Many scholars expressed outrage, prompting Atlanta University to provide Du Bois with a lifelong pension and the title of professor <a href="emeritus">emeritus</a>. <a href="Arthur%20B.%20Spingarn">Arthur Spingarn</a> remarked that Du Bois spent his time in Atlanta "battering his life out against ignorance, bigotry, intolerance and slothfulness, projecting ideas nobody but he understands, and raising hopes for change which may be comprehended in a hundred years."

Turning down job offers from <a href="Fisk%20University">Fisk</a> and <a href="Howard%20University">Howard</a>, Du Bois re-joined the NAACP as director of the Department of Special Research. Surprising many NAACP leaders, Du Bois jumped into the job with vigor and determination. During the 10 years while Du Bois was away from the NAACP, its income had increased fourfold, and its membership had soared to 325,000 members.
Du Bois was a member of the three-person delegation from the NAACP that attended the 1945 <a href="United%20Nations%20Conference%20on%20International%20Organization">conference in San Francisco</a> at which the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> was established. The NAACP delegation wanted the United Nations to endorse racial equality and to bring an end to the colonial era. To push the United Nations in that direction, Du Bois drafted a proposal that pronounced "[t]he colonial system of government ... is undemocratic, socially dangerous and a main cause of wars". The NAACP proposal received support from China, Russia and India, but it was virtually ignored by the other major powers, and the NAACP proposals were not included in the United Nations charter.

After the United Nations conference, Du Bois published "Color and Democracy: Colonies and Peace", a book that attacked colonial empires and, in the words of one reviewer, "contains enough dynamite to blow up the whole vicious system whereby we have comforted our white souls and lined the pockets of generations of free-booting capitalists."

In late 1945, Du Bois attended the fifth, and final, Pan-African Congress, in Manchester, England. The congress was the most productive of the five congresses, and there Du Bois met <a href="Kwame%20Nkrumah">Kwame Nkrumah</a>, the future first president of <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a> who would later invite Du Bois to Africa.

Du Bois helped to submit petitions to the UN concerning discrimination against African Americans, the most noteworthy of which was the NAACP's "An Appeal to the World: A Statement on the Denial of Human Rights to Minorities in the Case of Citizens of Negro Descent in the United States of America and an Appeal to the United Nations for Redress". This advocacy laid the foundation for the later report and petition called "<a href="We%20Charge%20Genocide">We Charge Genocide</a>", submitted in 1951 by the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Congress">Civil Rights Congress</a>. "We Charge Genocide" accuses the U.S. of systematically sanctioning murders and inflicting harm against African Americans and therefore committing <a href="genocide">genocide</a>.

When the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> commenced in the mid-1940s, the NAACP distanced itself from Communists, lest its funding or reputation suffer. The NAACP redoubled their efforts in 1947 after "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine published a piece by <a href="Arthur%20M.%20Schlesinger%20Jr.">Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.</a> claiming that the NAACP was heavily influenced by Communists. Ignoring the NAACP's desires, Du Bois continued to fraternize with communist sympathizers such as <a href="Paul%20Robeson">Paul Robeson</a>, <a href="Howard%20Fast">Howard Fast</a> and <a href="Shirley%20Graham">Shirley Graham</a> (his future second wife). Du Bois wrote "I am not a communist ... On the other hand, I ... believe ... that Karl Marx ... put his finger squarely upon our difficulties ...". In 1946, Du Bois wrote articles giving his assessment of the Soviet Union; he did not embrace communism and he criticized its dictatorship. However, he felt that capitalism was responsible for poverty and racism, and felt that socialism was an alternative that might ameliorate those problems. The Soviets explicitly rejected racial distinctions and class distinctions, leading Du Bois to conclude that the USSR was the "most hopeful country on earth." Du Bois's association with prominent communists made him a liability for the NAACP, especially since the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> was starting to aggressively investigate communist sympathizers; so – by mutual agreement – he resigned from the NAACP for the second time in late 1948. After departing the NAACP, Du Bois started writing regularly for the leftist weekly newspaper the "<a href="National%20Guardian">National Guardian</a>", a relationship that would endure until 1961.

Du Bois was a lifelong <a href="anti-war%20activist">anti-war activist</a>, but his efforts became more pronounced after World War II. In 1949, Du Bois spoke at the <a href="Scientific%20and%20Cultural%20Conference%20for%20World%20Peace">Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace</a> in New York: "I tell you, people of America, the dark world is on the move! It wants and will have Freedom, Autonomy and Equality. It will not be diverted in these fundamental rights by dialectical splitting of political hairs ... Whites may, if they will, arm themselves for suicide. But the vast majority of the world's peoples will march on over them to freedom!"

In the spring of 1949, he spoke at the <a href="World%20Congress%20of%20the%20Partisans%20of%20Peace%23Paris%20and%20Prague%201949">World Congress of the Partisans of Peace</a> in Paris, saying to the large crowd: "Leading this new colonial imperialism comes my own native land built by my father's toil and blood, the United States. The United States is a great nation; rich by grace of God and prosperous by the hard work of its humblest citizens ... Drunk with power we are leading the world to hell in a new colonialism with the same old human slavery which once ruined us; and to a third World War which will ruin the world."
Du Bois affiliated himself with a leftist organization, the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Arts%2C%20Sciences%20and%20Professions">National Council of Arts, Sciences and Professions</a>, and he traveled to Moscow as its representative to speak at the <a href="All-Soviet%20Peace%20Conference">All-Soviet Peace Conference</a> in late 1949.

During the 1950s, the U.S. government's anti-communist <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> campaign targeted Du Bois because of his socialist leanings. Historian <a href="Manning%20Marable">Manning Marable</a> characterizes the government's treatment of Du Bois as "ruthless repression" and a "political assassination".

The FBI began to compile a file on Du Bois in 1942, investigating him for possible subversive activities. The original investigation appears to have ended in 1943 because the FBI was unable to discover sufficient evidence against Du Bois. In 1949, the FBI reopened its files on Du Bois on the suspicion that he was among a group of "Concealed Communists." The most aggressive government attack against Du Bois occurred in the early 1950s, as a consequence of Du Bois's opposition to nuclear weapons. In 1950 Du Bois became chair of the newly created <a href="Peace%20Information%20Center">Peace Information Center</a> (PIC), which worked to publicize the <a href="Stockholm%20Peace%20Appeal">Stockholm Peace Appeal</a> in the United States. The primary purpose of the appeal was to gather signatures on a petition, asking governments around the world to ban all nuclear weapons.

The U.S. Justice department alleged that the PIC was acting as an agent of a foreign state, and thus required the PIC to register with the federal government. Du Bois and other PIC leaders refused, and they were indicted for failure to register. After the indictment, some of Du Bois's associates distanced themselves from him, and the NAACP refused to issue a statement of support; but many labor figures and leftists – including <a href="Langston%20Hughes">Langston Hughes</a> – supported Du Bois.

He was finally tried in 1951 represented by civil rights attorney <a href="Vito%20Marcantonio">Vito Marcantonio</a>. The case was dismissed before the jury rendered a verdict as soon as the defense attorney told the judge that "<a href="Albert%20Einstein">Dr. Albert Einstein</a> has offered to appear as character witness for Dr. Du Bois". Du Bois's memoir of the trial is "In Battle for Peace". Even though Du Bois was not convicted, the government confiscated Du Bois's passport and withheld it for eight years.

Du Bois was bitterly disappointed that many of his colleaguesparticularly the NAACPdid not support him during his 1951 PIC trial, whereas <a href="working%20class">working class</a> whites and blacks supported him enthusiastically. After the trial, Du Bois lived in Manhattan, writing and speaking, and continuing to associate primarily with leftist acquaintances. His primary concern was world peace, and he railed against military actions, such as the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, which he viewed as efforts by imperialist whites to maintain colored people in a submissive state.

In 1950, at the age of 82, Du Bois <a href="New%20York%20state%20election%2C%201950">ran for U.S. Senator</a> from New York on the <a href="American%20Labor%20Party">American Labor Party</a> ticket and received about 200,000 votes, or 4% of the statewide total. Du Bois continued to believe that capitalism was the primary culprit responsible for the subjugation of colored people around the world, and therefore – although he recognized the faults of the Soviet Union – he continued to uphold communism as a possible solution to racial problems. In the words of biographer David Lewis, Du Bois did not endorse communism for its own sake, but did so because "the enemies of his enemies were his friends". The same ambiguity characterized Du Bois's opinions of <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>: in 1940 he wrote disdainfully of the "Tyrant Stalin", but when Stalin died in 1953, Du Bois wrote a eulogy characterizing Stalin as "simple, calm, and courageous", and lauding him for being the "first [to] set Russia on the road to conquer race prejudice and make one nation out of its 140 groups without destroying their individuality".

The U.S. government prevented Du Bois from attending the 1955 <a href="Bandung%20Conference">Bandung Conference</a> in Indonesia. The conference was the culmination of 40 years of Du Bois's dreams – a meeting of 29 nations from Africa and Asia, many recently independent, representing most of the world's colored peoples. The conference celebrated their independence, as the nations began to assert their power as non-aligned nations during the Cold War. In 1958, Du Bois regained his passport, and with his second wife, <a href="Shirley%20Graham%20Du%20Bois">Shirley Graham Du Bois</a>, he traveled around the world, visiting Russia and China. In both countries he was celebrated. Du Bois later wrote approvingly of the conditions in both countries.

Du Bois became incensed in 1961 when the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States%20v.%20Subversive%20Activities%20Control%20Board">U.S. Supreme Court upheld</a> the 1950 <a href="McCarran%20Act">McCarran Act</a>, a key piece of McCarthyism legislation which required communists to register with the government. To demonstrate his outrage, he joined the Communist Party in October 1961, at the age of 93. Around that time, he wrote: "I believe in communism. I mean by communism, a planned way of life in the production of wealth and work designed for building a state whose object is the highest welfare of its people and not merely the profit of a part." He asked <a href="Herbert%20Aptheker">Herbert Aptheker</a>, a Communist and historian of African-American history, to be his literary executor.

Nkrumah invited Du Bois to Ghana to participate in their independence celebration in 1957, but he was unable to attend because the U.S. government had confiscated his passport in 1951. By 1960the "<a href="Year%20of%20Africa">Year of Africa</a>"Du Bois had recovered his passport, and was able to cross the Atlantic and celebrate the creation of the Republic of Ghana. Du Bois returned to Africa in late 1960 to attend the inauguration of <a href="Nnamdi%20Azikiwe">Nnamdi Azikiwe</a> as the first African governor of <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>.

While visiting Ghana in 1960, Du Bois spoke with its president about the creation of a new encyclopedia of the <a href="African%20diaspora">African diaspora</a>, the "<a href="Encyclopedia%20Africana">Encyclopedia Africana</a>". In early 1961, Ghana notified Du Bois that they had appropriated funds to support the encyclopedia project, and they invited Du Bois to come to Ghana and manage the project there. In October 1961, at the age of 93, Du Bois and his wife traveled to Ghana to take up residence and commence work on the encyclopedia. In early 1963, the United States refused to renew his passport, so he made the symbolic gesture of becoming a citizen of Ghana. 

While it is sometimes stated that Du Bois renounced his U.S. citizenship at that time, and he stated his intention to do so, Du Bois never actually did. His health declined during the two years he was in Ghana, and he died on August 27, 1963, in the capital of <a href="Accra">Accra</a> at the age of 95. The following day, at the <a href="March%20on%20Washington%20for%20Jobs%20and%20Freedom">March on Washington</a>, speaker <a href="Roy%20Wilkins">Roy Wilkins</a> asked the hundreds of thousands of marchers to honor Du Bois with a moment of silence. The <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, embodying many of the reforms Du Bois had campaigned for his entire life, was enacted almost a year after his death.

Du Bois was given a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> on August 29–30, 1963, at Nkrumah's request, and buried beside the western wall of <a href="Osu%20Castle">Christiansborg Castle</a> (now Osu Castle), then the <a href="seat%20of%20government">seat of government</a> in Accra. In 1985, another state ceremony honored Du Bois. With the ashes of his wife <a href="Shirley%20Graham%20Du%20Bois">Shirley Graham Du Bois</a>, who had died in 1977, his body was re-interred at their former home in Accra, which was dedicated the <a href="W.%20E.%20B.%20Du%20Bois%20Memorial%20Centre%20for%20Pan%20African%20Culture">W. E. B. Du Bois Memorial Centre for Pan African Culture</a> in his memory. (Du Bois's first wife Nina, their son Burghardt, and their daughter Yolande, who died in 1961, were buried in the cemetery of Great Barrington, Massachusetts, his hometown.)

Du Bois was organized and disciplined: his lifelong regimen was to rise at 7:15, work until 5, eat dinner and read a newspaper until 7, then read or socialize until he was in bed, invariably before 10. He was a meticulous planner, and frequently mapped out his schedules and goals on large pieces of graph paper. Many acquaintances found him to be distant and aloof, and he insisted on being addressed as "Dr. Du Bois". Although he was not gregarious, he formed several close friendships with associates such as <a href="Charles%20Young%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Charles Young</a>, <a href="Paul%20Laurence%20Dunbar">Paul Laurence Dunbar</a>, <a href="John%20Hope%20%28educator%29">John Hope</a> and <a href="Mary%20White%20Ovington">Mary White Ovington</a>. His closest friend was <a href="Joel%20Elias%20Spingarn">Joel Spingarn</a> – a white man – but Du Bois never accepted Spingarn's offer to be on a first-name basis. Du Bois was something of a <a href="dandy">dandy</a> – he dressed formally, carried a walking stick, and walked with an air of confidence and dignity. 

He was relatively short, standing at , and always maintained a well-groomed mustache and goatee. He enjoyed singing and playing tennis.

Du Bois married Nina Gomer (m. 1896, d. 1950), with whom he had two children. Their son Burghardt died as an infant before their second child was born. The second was a daughter, <a href="Yolande%20Du%20Bois">Yolande</a>. She attended Fisk University and became a high school teacher in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>. Her father encouraged her marriage to <a href="Countee%20Cullen">Countee Cullen</a>, a nationally known poet of the Harlem Renaissance. They divorced within two years. She married again and had a daughter, Du Bois's only grandchild. That marriage also ended in divorce. 

As a widower, Du Bois married <a href="Shirley%20Graham%20Du%20Bois">Shirley Graham</a> (m. 1951, d. 1977), an author, playwright, composer, and activist. She brought her son David Graham to the marriage. David grew close to Du Bois and took his stepfather's name; he also worked for African-American causes. The historian David Levering Lewis wrote that Du Bois engaged in several extramarital relationships.

Although Du Bois attended a New England <a href="Congregationalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Congregational church</a> as a child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as <a href="agnostic">agnostic</a> or a <a href="freethought">freethinker</a>, but at least one biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>. However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices of his era. Du Bois was credited with inaugurating a 20th-century spirituality to which <a href="Ralph%20Ellison">Ralph Ellison</a>, <a href="Zora%20Neale%20Hurston">Zora Neale Hurston</a>, and <a href="James%20Baldwin">James Baldwin</a> also belong.

When asked to lead public prayers, Du Bois would refuse. In his autobiography, Du Bois wrote:

When I became head of a department at Atlanta, the engagement was held up because again I balked at leading in prayer ... I flatly refused again to join any church or sign any church creed. ... I think the greatest gift of the Soviet Union to modern civilization was the dethronement of the clergy and the refusal to let religion be taught in the public schools.

Du Bois accused American churches of being the most discriminatory of all institutions. He also provocatively linked African-American Christianity to indigenous African religions. Du Bois occasionally acknowledged the beneficial role religion played in African-American life – as the "basic rock" which served as an anchor for African-American communities – but in general disparaged African-American churches and clergy because he felt they did not support the goals of racial equality and hindered activists' efforts.

Although Du Bois was not personally religious, he infused his writings with religious symbology. Many contemporaries viewed him as a prophet. His 1904 <a href="prose%20poem">prose poem</a>, "Credo", was written in the style of a religious <a href="creed">creed</a> and widely read by the African-American community. Moreover, Du Bois, both in his own fiction and in stories published in "The Crisis", often drew analogies between the lynchings of African Americans and the crucifixion of Christ. Between 1920 and 1940, Du Bois shifted from overt black messiah symbolism to more subtle messianic language.

Hitler Diaries

The Hitler Diaries () were a series of sixty volumes of journals purportedly written by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, but forged by <a href="Konrad%20Kujau">Konrad Kujau</a> between 1981 and 1983. The diaries were purchased in 1983 for 9.3 million <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">Deutsche Mark</a>s (£2.33 million or $3.7 million) by the West German news magazine "<a href="Stern%20%28magazine%29">Stern</a>", which sold serialisation rights to several news organisations. One such publication, the British newspaper "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>", asked their independent director, the historian <a href="Hugh%20Trevor-Roper">Hugh Trevor-Roper</a>, to authenticate the diaries; he pronounced them genuine. At the press conference to announce the publication, Trevor-Roper announced that he had changed his mind, and other historians also raised questions concerning their validity. Rigorous forensic analysis, which had not been performed previously, quickly confirmed that the diaries were fakes.

Kujau, born and raised in East Germany, had a history of petty crime and deception. In the mid-1970s he began selling <a href="Nazi%20memorabilia">Nazi memorabilia</a> which he was smuggling from the East, but found he could raise the prices by forging additional authentication details to link ordinary souvenirs to the Nazi leaders. He began forging paintings by Hitler and an increasing number of notes, poems and letters, until he produced his first diary in the mid- to late 1970s. The West German journalist with "Stern" who "discovered" the diaries and was involved in their purchase was <a href="Gerd%20Heidemann">Gerd Heidemann</a>, who had an obsession with the Nazis. When "Stern" started buying the diaries, Heidemann stole a significant proportion of the money.

Kujau and Heidemann spent time in prison for their parts in the fraud, and several newspaper editors lost their jobs. The story of the scandal was the basis for the films "<a href="Selling%20Hitler">Selling Hitler</a>" (1991) for the British channel <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> and the German cinema release "<a href="Schtonk%21">Schtonk!</a>" (1992).

On 20 April 1945—<a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>'s 56th birthday—Soviet troops were on the verge of taking Berlin and the Western Allies had already taken several German cities. Hitler's private secretary, <a href="Martin%20Bormann">Martin Bormann</a>, put into action Operation Seraglio, a plan to evacuate the key and favoured members of Hitler's entourage from the Berlin bunker where they were based, the "<a href="F%C3%BChrerbunker">Führerbunker</a>", to an Alpine command centre near <a href="Berchtesgaden">Berchtesgaden</a>—Hitler's retreat in southern Germany. Ten aeroplanes flew out from <a href="RAF%20Gatow">Gatow airfield</a> under the overall command of General <a href="Hans%20Baur">Hans Baur</a>, Hitler's personal pilot. The final flight out was a <a href="Junkers%20Ju%20352">Junkers Ju 352</a> transport plane, piloted by Major Friedrich Gundlfinger—on board were ten heavy chests under the supervision of Hitler's personal valet Sergeant Wilhelm Arndt. The plane crashed into the Heidenholz Forest, near the Czechoslovak border.

Some of the more useful parts of Gundlfinger's plane were appropriated by locals before the police and <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> cordoned off the crash. When Baur told Hitler what had happened, the German leader expressed grief at the loss of Arndt, one of his most favoured servants, and added: "I entrusted him with extremely valuable documents which would show posterity the truth of my actions!" Apart from this quoted sentence, there is no indication of what was in the boxes. The last of the crash's two survivors died in April 1980, and Bormann had died after leaving the Berlin bunker following Hitler's suicide on 30 April 1945. In the decades following the war, the possibility of a hidden cache of private papers belonging to Hitler became, according to the journalist <a href="Robert%20Harris%20%28novelist%29">Robert Harris</a>, a "tantalizing state of affairs [that] was to provide the perfect scenario for forgery".
<a href="Konrad%20Kujau">Konrad Kujau</a> was born in 1938 in <a href="L%C3%B6bau">Löbau</a>, near <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, in what would become <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a>. His parents, a shoemaker and his wife, had both joined the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> in 1933. The boy grew up believing in the Nazi ideals and idolising Hitler; Germany's defeat and Hitler's suicide in 1945 did not temper his enthusiasm for the Nazi cause. He held a series of menial jobs until 1957, when a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with the theft of a microphone from the Löbau Youth Club. He fled to <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, and soon drifted into temporary work and petty crime. After running a dance bar during the early 1960s with his girlfriend, Edith Lieblang—whom he later married—Kujau began to create a fictional background for himself. He told people that his real name was Peter Fischer, changed his date of birth by two years, and altered the story of his time in East Germany. By 1963 the bar had begun to suffer financial difficulties, and Kujau started his career as a counterfeiter, forging 27 <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">Deutsche Mark</a>s' (DM) worth of <a href="Meal%20voucher">luncheon vouchers</a>; he was caught and sentenced to five days in prison. On his release he and his wife formed the Lieblang Cleaning Company, although it provided little income for them. In March 1968, at a routine check at Kujau's lodgings, the police established he was living under a false identity and he was sent to Stuttgart's <a href="Stammheim%20Prison">Stammheim Prison</a>.
In 1970 Kujau visited his family in East Germany and discovered that many of the locals held Nazi memorabilia, contrary to the laws of the communist government. He saw an opportunity to buy the material cheaply on the black market, and make a profit in the West, where the increasing demand among Stuttgart collectors was raising memorabilia prices up to ten times the amount he would pay. The trade was illegal in East Germany, and the export of what were deemed items of cultural heritage was banned. Among the items smuggled out of East Germany were weapons.

In 1974 Kujau rented a shop into which he placed his Nazi memorabilia; the outlet also became the venue for late-night drinking sessions with friends and fellow collectors, including Wolfgang Schulze, who lived in the US and became Kujau's agent there. Kujau inflated the value of items in his shop by forging additional authentication details—for example a genuine First World War helmet, worth a few marks, became considerably more valuable after Kujau forged a note indicating that Hitler had worn it at <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a> in late October 1914. In addition to notes by Hitler, he produced documents supposedly handwritten by Bormann, <a href="Rudolf%20Hess">Rudolf Hess</a>, <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a>, <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>. He forged passable imitations of his subjects' genuine handwriting, but the rest of the work was crude: Kujau used modern stationery such as <a href="Letraset">Letraset</a> to create letterheads, and he tried to make his products look suitably old by pouring tea over them. Mistakes in spelling or grammar were relatively common, particularly when he forged in English; a supposed copy of the 1938 <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> between Hitler and <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> read, in part:

We regard the areement signet last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another againe.

In the mid- to late 1970s Kujau, an able amateur artist, turned to producing paintings which he claimed were by Hitler, who had been an amateur artist as a young man. Having found a market for his forged works, Kujau created Hitler paintings depicting subjects his buyers expressed interest in, such as cartoons, nudes and men in action—all subjects that Hitler never painted, nor would want to paint, according to <a href="Charles%20Hamilton%20%28handwriting%20expert%29">Charles Hamilton</a>, a handwriting expert and author of books on forgery. These paintings were often accompanied by small notes, purportedly from Hitler. The paintings were profitable for Kujau. To explain his access to the memorabilia he invented several sources in East Germany, including a former Nazi general, the bribable director of a museum and his own brother, whom he re-invented as a general in the East German army.

Having found success in passing off his forged notes as those of Hitler, Kujau grew more ambitious and copied, by hand, the text from both volumes of "<a href="Mein%20Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>", even though the originals had been completed by typewriter. Kujau also produced an introduction to a third volume of the work. He sold these manuscripts to one of his regular customers, Fritz Stiefel, a collector of Nazi memorabilia who accepted them and many other Kujau products as genuine. Kujau also began forging a series of war poems by Hitler, which were so amateurish that Kujau later conceded that "a fourteen-year-old collector would have recognised it as a forgery".

<a href="Gerd%20Heidemann">Gerd Heidemann</a> was born in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> in 1931. During the rise of Hitler his parents remained apolitical, but Heidemann, like many other young boys, joined the <a href="Hitler%20Youth">Hitler Youth</a>. After the war he trained as an electrician, and pursued an interest in photography. He began working in a photographic laboratory and became a freelance photographer for the <a href="Deutsche%20Presse-Agentur">Deutsche Presse-Agentur</a> and Keystone news agencies, as well as some local Hamburg papers. He had his first work published in "<a href="Stern%20%28magazine%29">Stern</a>" in 1951 and four years later joined the paper as a full-time member of staff. From 1961 he covered wars and hostilities across Africa and the Middle East; he became obsessed with these conflicts and other stories on which he worked, such as the search for the identity of the German writer <a href="B.%20Traven">B. Traven</a>. Although he was an excellent researcher—his colleagues called him , the Bloodhound—he would not know when to stop investigating, which led to other writers having to finish off the stories from large quantities of notes.

On behalf of "Stern", in January 1973 Heidemann photographed the "Carin II", a yacht that formerly belonged to Göring. The boat was in a poor state of repair and expensive to maintain, but Heidemann took a mortgage on his Hamburg flat and purchased it. While researching the history of the yacht, Heidemann interviewed Göring's daughter, <a href="Edda%20G%C3%B6ring">Edda</a>, after which the couple began an affair. Through this relationship and his ownership of the boat he was introduced to a circle of former Nazis. He began to hold parties on the "Carin II", with the former <a href="SS">SS</a> generals <a href="Karl%20Wolff">Karl Wolff</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Mohnke">Wilhelm Mohnke</a> as the guests of honour. Wolff and Mohnke were witnesses at Heidemann's wedding to his third wife in 1979; the couple went on honeymoon to South America accompanied by Wolff, where they met more ex-Nazis, including <a href="Walter%20Rauff">Walter Rauff</a> and <a href="Klaus%20Barbie">Klaus Barbie</a>, who were both wanted in the West for war crimes.

The purchase of the yacht caused Heidemann financial problems, and in 1976 he agreed terms with <a href="Gruner%20%2B%20Jahr">Gruner + Jahr</a>, "Stern"s parent company, to produce a book based on the conversations he was having with the former soldiers and SS men. When the book went unwritten—the material provided by the former SS officers was not sufficiently interesting or verifiable for publication—Heidemann borrowed increasingly large sums from his employers to pay for the boat's upkeep. In June 1978 he advertised the boat for sale, asking 1.1 million DMs; he received no offers. Mohnke recommended that Heidemann speak to Jakob Tiefenthaeler, a Nazi memorabilia collector and a former member of the SS. Tiefenthaeler was not in a position to buy the yacht, but was happy to act as an agent; his endeavours did not produce a sale. Realising Heidemann's financial circumstances, Tiefenthaeler provided him with names of other collectors in the Stuttgart area. The journalist made a trip to the south of Germany and met Stiefel, who purchased some of Göring's effects.

 (German for "Star"), a German weekly news magazine published in Hamburg, was formed by the journalist and businessman <a href="Henri%20Nannen">Henri Nannen</a> in 1948 to offer scandal, gossip and human interest stories. It was, according to the German media experts Frank Esser and Uwe Hartung, known for its investigative journalism and was politically left-of-centre. In 1981 Nannen resigned from his position of editor of the magazine, and moved to take the role of "publisher". In his place "Stern" had three editors: Peter Koch, Rolf Gillhausen and Felix Schmidt, who were aided by others including the journal's head of contemporary history, Thomas Walde. Manfred Fischer was <a href="Chief%20executive%20officer">CEO</a> of Gruner + Jahr until 1981 when he was promoted to the board of <a href="Bertelsmann">Bertelsmann</a>, their parent company; he was replaced by Gerd Schulte-Hillen. Wilfried Sorge was one of the Gruner + Jahr managers responsible for international sales.

"<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" is a British national <a href="broadsheet">broadsheet</a> newspaper, the Sunday <a href="sister%20paper">sister paper</a> of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>". In 1968, under the ownership of <a href="Roy%20Thomson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Thomson%20of%20Fleet">Lord Thomson</a>, "The Sunday Times" had been involved in a deal to purchase the <a href="Mussolini%20diaries">Mussolini diaries</a> for an agreed final purchase price of £250,000, although they had only paid out an initial amount of £60,000. These turned out to be forgeries undertaken by an Italian mother and daughter, Amalia and Rosa Panvini. In 1981 <a href="Rupert%20Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>, who owned several other papers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, purchased Times Newspapers Ltd, which owned both "The Times" and its Sunday sister. Murdoch appointed <a href="Frank%20Giles">Frank Giles</a> to be the editor of "The Sunday Times". The historian <a href="Hugh%20Trevor-Roper">Hugh Trevor-Roper</a> became an <a href="Non-executive%20director">independent national director</a> of "The Times" in 1974. Trevor-Roper—who was created Baron Dacre of Glanton in 1979—was a specialist on Nazi Germany, who had worked for the <a href="MI6">British Intelligence Services</a> during and after the Second World War. At the war's end he had undertaken an official investigation of Hitler's death, interviewing eyewitnesses to the <a href="F%C3%BChrer">Führer</a>'s last movements. In addition to the official report he filed, Trevor-Roper also published "The Last Days of Hitler" (1947) on the subject. He subsequently wrote about the Nazis in "Hitler's War Directives" (1964) and "Hitler's Place in History" (1965).

"<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>", an American weekly news magazine, was founded in 1933. In 1982 the journalist <a href="William%20Broyles%2C%20Jr.">William Broyles</a> was appointed editor-in-chief, while the editor was Maynard Parker; that year the company had circulation figures of three million readers.

It is unclear when Kujau produced his first Hitler diary. Stiefel says Kujau gave him a diary on loan in 1975. Schulze puts the date as 1976, while Kujau says he began in 1978, after a month's practice writing in the old German <a href="Kurrent">gothic script</a> Hitler had used. Kujau used one of a pile of notebooks he had bought cheaply in East Berlin, and attempted to put the letters "AH" in gold on the front—purchasing plastic, Hong Kong-made letters from a department store, he inadvertently used "FH" rather than "AH". He took the black ribbon from a genuine SS document and attached it to the cover using a German army wax seal. For the ink, he bought two bottles of <a href="Pelikan">Pelikan</a> ink—one black, one blue—and mixed them with water so it would flow more easily from the cheap modern pen he used. Finally, he sprinkled tea over the pages and bashed the diaries against his desk to give them an aged look. Kujau showed the first volume to Stiefel, who was impressed and thought it a genuine Hitler diary; Stiefel wanted to buy it, but, when the forger refused, the pair agreed that the collector could have it on loan.

In June 1979, Stiefel asked a former Nazi Party archivist, August Priesack, to verify the authenticity of the diary, which he subsequently did. Priesack showed the diary to <a href="Eberhard%20J%C3%A4ckel">Eberhard Jäckel</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Stuttgart">University of Stuttgart</a>, who also thought the diary to be genuine and wanted to edit it for publication. News of the diary's existence soon began to filter through to collectors of Hitler memorabilia. At the end of 1979, Tiefenthaeler contacted Heidemann to say that Stiefel had shown him around his collection, which included a Hitler diary—the only one Kujau had forged to that point. According to Hamilton "the discovery inflamed Heidemann almost to madness" and he aggressively pressed for what would be a journalistic scoop.

Stiefel showed Heidemann the diary in Stuttgart in January 1980, telling him it was from a plane crash in East Germany, although he refused to tell the journalist the name of his source. The collector spoke to Kujau to see if he would meet Heidemann, but the forger repeatedly refused Heidemann's requests for nearly a year. Heidemann returned to the "Stern" offices and spoke to his editor, but both Koch and Nannen refused to discuss the potential story with him, telling him to work on other features. The only person who was interested was Walde, who worked with Heidemann to find the source of the diaries. Their searches for Kujau proved fruitless, so they looked into the crash. Heidemann, who had read Baur's autobiography, knew of Gundlfinger's flight and made a connection between Operation Seraglio and the diary; in November 1980 the two journalists travelled to Dresden and located the graves of the flight's crew.

In January 1981, Tiefenthaeler gave Kujau's telephone number to Heidemann, telling the journalist to ask for "Mr Fischer", one of Kujau's aliases. During the subsequent phone call, Kujau told Heidemann that there were 27 volumes of Hitler's diaries, the original manuscript of the unpublished third volume of "Mein Kampf", an opera by the young Hitler called ("Wieland the Blacksmith"), numerous letters and unpublished papers, and several of Hitler's paintings—most of which were still in East Germany. Heidemann offered two million DMs for the entire collection and guaranteed secrecy until everything had been brought over the border. Although the pair did not agree to a deal, they agreed to "the foundations of a deal", according to Harris; Kujau's condition was that he would only deal directly with Heidemann, something that suited the journalist as a way of keeping other members of "Stern" away from the story.

Heidemann and Walde produced a prospectus for internal discussion, outlining what was available for purchase and the costs. The document, signed by Heidemann, finished with a veiled threat: "If our company thinks that the risk is too great, I suggest that I should seek out a publishing company in the United States which could put up the money and ensure that we get the German publication rights." The pair did not show the prospectus to anyone at "Stern", but instead presented it to Gruner + Jahr's deputy managing director, Dr Jan Hensmann, and Manfred Fischer; they also requested a 200,000 mark deposit from the publisher to secure the rights with Kujau. After a meeting that lasted a little over two hours, and with no recourse to an expert or historian, the deposit was authorised. As soon as the meeting ended, at about 7 pm, Heidemann travelled to Stuttgart, with the deposit money, to meet Kujau.

At that first meeting on 28 January 1981, which lasted over seven hours, Heidemann offered Kujau a deposit of only 100,000 DMs to agree the deal, which Kujau did not accept. At a second meeting the following day, the reporter revealed an additional lure he had brought with him: a uniform which he said was Göring's. Kujau tentatively agreed to provide the diaries and told Heidemann that he would call him as soon as he could arrange to receive them from East Germany. As a sign of good faith Heidemann lent the uniform to the forger, to show alongside his collection of other uniforms from the top Nazis; for his part, Kujau gave the journalist a painting purportedly by Hitler. Both the painting and uniform were fakes.
A week later Kujau met Jäckel and Alex Kuhn in connection with the poems he had forged and sold to Stiefel. These had been published by Jäckel and Kuhn in 1980, but one historian pointed out that one of the poems could not have been produced by Hitler as it had been written by the poet <a href="Herybert%20Menzel">Herybert Menzel</a>. Jäckel was concerned that the poem in question had been accompanied by a letter on Nazi party stationery guaranteeing it as a genuine work by Hitler. Many of the other pieces in Stiefel's collection were similarly verified, so doubts began to surface over these, too. Kujau claimed ignorance, saying he was only the middleman, but told them that Heidemann, a reputed journalist, had seen the crash site from which the papers originated; Jäckel advised Stiefel to have his collection forensically examined, and passed 26 suspect poems to the Hamburg district attorney for investigation. Gruner + Jahr also knew about the problems with the poems, and that the source had been Kujau, but he assured them that this source had been elsewhere in East Germany, unconnected to the diaries, and they continued with their deal.

Ten days after the meeting with Jäckel and Kuhn, Kujau had prepared three further diaries. The contents were copied from a range of books, newspapers and magazines covering Hitler's life. Primary among them was the two-volume work by the historian <a href="Max%20Domarus">Max Domarus</a>, ("Hitler: Speeches and Proclamations, 1932–45"), which presents Hitler's day-to-day activities. Many of the diary's entries were lists of Nazi party promotions and official engagements. Although Kujau created some personal information about Hitler in the diaries, this was, in the opinion of both Harris and Hamilton, trivia. He began working to a schedule of producing three diaries a month. He later stated that he managed to produce one of the volumes in three hours; on a separate occasion he wrote three diaries in three days.

On 17 February 1981 Kujau flew to Stuttgart and gave Heidemann the three recently prepared diaries, for which Heidemann gave him 35,000 DMs. This was a great deal less than the 120,000 DMs—40,000 DMs per diary—promised to Kujau in the first meeting, from which Heidemann would also claim a 10% commission; the reduction in funds was explained by a need to get an "expert opinion" on the authenticity of the diaries, and the balance was later paid. The following day the reporter delivered the diaries to Gruner + Jahr. In the subsequent meeting with Walde, Hensmann, Sorge and Fischer, Heidemann and Walde again insisted on secrecy about the project, to ensure their acquisition of all the diaries—it was agreed that not even the editors of "Stern" should be told of the discovery. More importantly, according to Harris, it was decided that they should not have the material examined by a forensic scientist or historian until every diary had been obtained. Fischer committed the company to the future purchases by immediately allocating one million DM to the project. The company also set up a dedicated unit to deal with the diaries in an annex to the main Gruner + Jahr offices. It was headed by Walde, and consisted of an assistant, two secretaries and Heidemann. On receipt of the diaries they were photocopied and transcribed from the gothic script into modern German. Heidemann also entered into a private contract with Gruner + Jahr, which was kept secret from the company's legal and personnel departments. It contained a deal for him to publish books through the company at a generous royalty rate, and agreed that ten years after publication the original diaries would be given to Heidemann for research purposes, to be handed on to the West German government on his death. He was also to be given a bonus of 300,000 DMs for recovering the first eight diaries.

The delivery of the diaries continued, although there were tensions between Heidemann and Kujau, partly owing to the journalist's "domineering personality and duplicity". Because of the nature of the transactions there were no receipts provided by Heidemann to Gruner + Jahr, and the business was conducted by the company on the basis of trust. By the end of February 1981, 680,000 DMs had been paid for the diaries, only around half of which was received by Kujau. Heidemann had pocketed the rest, defrauding both his employer and the forger in the process.

Despite the self-imposed restrictions of secrecy placed on the small circle inside Gruner + Jahr, Heidemann could not resist showing one of the volumes to Mohnke, as the entry referred to the <a href="1st%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Leibstandarte%20SS%20Adolf%20Hitler">SS "Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler"</a>, Mohnke's former regiment. Heidemann read out three entries from the diaries—from 15, 17 and 18 March—which concerned visits made by Hitler to the regiment while in the <a href="Lichterfelde%20%28Berlin%29">Lichterfelde</a> and Friesenstraße barracks. Mohnke informed him that the entries were inaccurate, saying that the Lichterfelde barracks were not occupied by the troops on that date, that the regimental name used in the diary was introduced much later, and that so far as he knew Hitler never visited the Friesenstraße barracks. Heidemann was unmoved by his friend's revelations, and posited that Hitler had probably written what he was planning to do, not what he had done. Harris suggests that this showed that the journalist "had long ceased operating on a rational wavelength about the diaries".

The circle of those at Gruner + Jahr who knew about the diaries grew in May 1981 when Fischer decided to look into the complicated copyright circumstances surrounding Hitler's property. He discussed the matter with the company's legal advisor, Andreas Ruppert, who advised speaking to <a href="Werner%20Maser">Werner Maser</a>, a historian who acted as a trustee on such matters to the <a href="Hitler%20family">Hitler family</a>. Heidemann visited Maser in June 1981 and came to a deal that enabled the journalist and "Stern", for a payment of 20,000 DMs, to retain "the rights to all the discovered or purchased documents or notes in the hand of Adolf Hitler ... which have so far not yet been published".

After twelve diaries had been delivered to Gruner + Jahr, Heidemann informed his employers that the price had risen from 85,000 DMs to 100,000 DMs per diary; the reason given by Heidemann was that the East German general smuggling the diaries was now having to bribe more people. The additional money was retained by Heidemann and not passed on to Kujau. The journalist was starting to lead a profligate lifestyle on his illicit profits, including two new cars (a BMW convertible and a Porsche, for a combined total of 58,000 DMs), renting two new flats on Hamburg's exclusive <a href="Elbchaussee">Elbchaussee</a> and jewellery. He also spent considerable sums acquiring new Nazi memorabilia. Some were genuine, such as Wolff's SS honour dagger; others were purchased from Kujau, including 300 forged oil paintings, drawings and sketches Kujau claimed were by Hitler. Other items, carrying notes by Kujau attesting to their authenticity, included a gun described as that used by Hitler to commit suicide, and a flag identified as the ("Blood Flag"), carried in Hitler's failed <a href="Beer%20Hall%20Putsch">Munich Beer Hall Putsch</a> of 1923, and stained by the blood of Nazis shot by police.

The purchases of the diaries continued throughout mid to late 1981: Gruner + Jahr gave Heidemann 345,000 DMs on 29 July, and a further 220,000 DMs a week later, which brought the total up to 1.81 million DMs since the start of the year. This sum had purchased 18 diaries for the company. Schulte-Hillen, the new managing director, signed an authorisation for a further million DMs for future purchases. Just over two weeks later he signed a further authorisation for 600,000 DMs after Heidemann told him that the cost of the diaries had now risen to 200,000 DMs each; Heidemann also passed on the news that there were more than 27 diaries.

In mid-December 1982 the author and future <a href="Holocaust%20denial">Holocaust denier</a> <a href="David%20Irving">David Irving</a> was also involved in tracking the existence of diaries written by Hitler. Priesack had previously told Irving of the existence of one of the diaries with a collector in Stuttgart. In a visit to Priesack to assess his collection of Nazi documents, Irving found out Stiefel's phone number, from which he worked out the address; he also obtained photocopies of some of the diary pages from Priesack. Irving visited Stiefel unannounced and tried to find out the name of the source, but the collector misled him as to the origin. Irving examined Priesack's photocopies and saw a number of problems, including spelling mistakes and the change in writing style between certain words.

In April 1982 Walde and Heidemann contacted Josef Henke and Klaus Oldenhage of the (German Federal Archives) and Max Frei-Sulzer, the former head of the forensic department of the Zürich police, for assistance in authenticating the diaries. They did not specifically mention the diaries, but referred generally to new material. They also did not give the forensic specialists an entire diary, but removed one page only. For comparison purposes they also provided the experts with other samples of Hitler's writing, a handwritten draft for a telegram: this was from Heidemann's own collection and had also been forged by Kujau. Within days Walde provided further documents for comparison—all Kujau forgeries. Walde then flew to the US and commissioned Ordway Hilton, another forensic expert. None of those involved were experts in examining Nazi documents, and Hilton could not read German. "Stern"s management were too bound up in a secretive approach to be open about their source, or to provide the experts with a complete diary, which would have led to a more thorough examination of wider material. From the samples provided, the experts concluded that the handwriting was genuine. Hilton subsequently reported that "there was just no question" that both documents he had were written by the same person, whom he assumed to be Hitler.

The purchase of the diaries continued, and by June 1982 Gruner + Jahr possessed 35 volumes. In early 1983 the company took the decision to work towards a publication date for the diaries. To ensure wide readership and to maximise their returns, "Stern" issued a prospectus to potentially interested parties, "Newsweek", "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>", "<a href="Paris%20Match">Paris Match</a>" and a syndicate of papers owned by <a href="Rupert%20Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>. "Stern" rented a large vault in a Swiss bank. They filled the space with Nazi memorabilia and displayed various letters and manuscripts.

The first historian to examine the diaries was Hugh Trevor-Roper, who was cautious, but impressed with the volume of documentation in front of him. As the background to the acquisition was explained to him he became less doubtful; he was falsely informed that the paper had been chemically tested and been shown to be pre-war, and he was told that "Stern" knew the identity of the officer who had rescued the documents from the plane and had stored them ever since. By the end of the meeting he was convinced that the diaries were genuine, and later said "who, I asked myself, would forge sixty volumes when six would have served his purpose?" In an article in "The Times" on 23 April 1983 he wrote:

I am now satisfied that the documents are authentic; that the history of their wanderings since 1945 is true; and that the standard accounts of Hitler's writing habits, of his personality, and even, perhaps, of some public events may, in consequence, have to be revised.

The day after Trevor-Roper gave his opinion of authenticity, Rupert Murdoch and his negotiation team arrived in Zürich. A deal was provisionally agreed for $2.5 million for the US serialisation rights, with an additional $750,000 for British and Commonwealth rights. While the discussions between Murdoch and Sorge were taking place, the diaries were examined by Broyle and his "Newsweek" team. After lengthy negotiation Broyle was informed that the minimum price "Stern" would consider was $3 million; the Americans returned home, informing Hensmann that they would contact him by phone in two days. When Broyle contacted the Germans he offered the amount, subject to authentication by their chosen expert, <a href="Gerhard%20Weinberg">Gerhard Weinberg</a>. In 1952 Weinberg, a cautious and careful historian, had written the "Guide to Captured German Documents", for use by the US military; the work is described by Hamilton as definitive in its scope of the subject. Weinberg travelled to Zürich and, like Trevor-Roper, was impressed and reassured by the range of items on show; he was also partly persuaded by Trevor-Roper's endorsement of the diaries' authenticity. Weinberg commented that "the notion of anyone forging hundreds, even thousands of pages of handwriting was hard to credit".

"Newsweek" verbally accepted Hensmann's offer and he in turn informed Murdoch, giving him the option to raise his bid. Murdoch was furious, having considered the handshake agreement in Zürich final. On 15 April 1983 Murdoch, with Mark Edmiston, the president of "Newsweek", met Schulte-Hillen, who, unexpectedly and without explanation, went back on all the previous verbal—and therefore, to his mind, non-binding—agreements and told them the price was now $4.25 million. Murdoch and Edmiston refused to accede to the new price and both left. The managers of "Stern", with no publishing partners, backtracked on their statements and came to a second deal with Murdoch, who drove the price down, paying $800,000 for the US rights, and $400,000 for the British and Australian rights. Further deals were done in France with "Paris Match" for $400,000; in Spain with "Grupo Zeta" for $150,000; in the Netherlands for $125,000; in Norway for $50,000; and in Italy with "<a href="Panorama%20%28magazine%29">Panorama</a>" for $50,000. "Newsweek" did not enter into a deal and instead based their subsequent stories on the copies of the diaries they had seen during the negotiation period.

On 22 April 1983 a press release from "Stern" announced the existence of the diaries and their forthcoming publication; a press conference was announced for 25 April. On hearing the news from "Stern", Jäckel stated that he was "extremely sceptical" about the diaries, while his fellow historian, <a href="Karl%20Dietrich%20Bracher">Karl Dietrich Bracher</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Bonn">University of Bonn</a> also thought their legitimacy unlikely. Irving was receiving calls from international news companies—the BBC, "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", "Newsweek", "<a href="Bild%20Zeitung">Bild Zeitung</a>"—and he was informing them all that the diaries were fakes. The <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">German Chancellor</a>, <a href="Helmut%20Kohl">Helmut Kohl</a>, also said that he could not believe the diaries were genuine. The following day "The Times" published the news that their Sunday sister paper had the serialisation rights for the UK; the edition also carried an extensive piece by Trevor-Roper with his opinion on the authenticity and importance of the discovery. By this stage the historian had growing doubts over the diaries, which he passed on to the editor of "The Times", <a href="Charles%20Douglas-Home%20%28journalist%29">Charles Douglas-Home</a>. The "Times" editor presumed that Trevor-Roper would also contact Giles at "The Sunday Times", while Trevor-Roper thought that Douglas-Home would do so; neither did. The Sunday paper thus remained oblivious of the growing concerns that the diaries might not be genuine.

On the evening of 23 April the presses began rolling for the following day's edition of "The Sunday Times". After an evening meeting of the editorial staff, Giles phoned Trevor-Roper to ask him to write a piece rebutting the criticism of the diaries. He found that the historian had made "a 180 degree turn" regarding the diaries' authenticity, and was now far from sure that they were real. The paper's deputy editor, <a href="Brian%20MacArthur">Brian MacArthur</a>, rang Murdoch to see if they should stop the print run and re-write the affected pages. Murdoch's reply was "Fuck Dacre. Publish".

On the afternoon of the 24 April, in Hamburg for the press conference the following day, Trevor-Roper asked Heidemann for the name of his source: the journalist refused, and gave a different story of how the diaries had been acquired. Trevor-Roper was suspicious and questioned the reporter closely for over an hour. Heidemann accused the historian of acting "exactly like an officer of the British army" in 1945. At a subsequent dinner the historian was evasive when asked by "Stern" executives what he was going to say at the announcement the following day.

At the press conference both Trevor-Roper and Weinberg expressed their doubts at the authenticity, and stated that German experts needed to examine the diaries to confirm whether the works were genuine. Trevor-Roper went on to say that his doubts sprung from the lack of proof that these books were the same ones as had been on the crashed plane in 1945. He finished his statement by saying that "I regret that the normal method of historical verification has been sacrificed to the perhaps necessary requirements of a journalistic scoop." The leading article in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" described his public reversal as showing "moral courage". Irving, who had been described in the introductory statement by Koch as a historian "with no reputation to lose", stood at the microphone for questions, and asked how Hitler could have written his diary in the days following the <a href="20%20July%20plot">20 July plot</a>, when his arm had been damaged. He denounced the diaries as forgeries, and held aloft the photocopied pages he had been given from Priesack. He asked if the ink in the diaries had been tested, but there was no response from the managers of "Stern". Photographers and film crews jostled to get a better picture of Irving, and some punches were thrown by journalists while security guards moved in and forcibly removed Irving from the room, while he shouted "Ink! Ink!".

With grave doubts now expressed about the authenticity of the diaries, "Stern" faced the possibility of legal action for disseminating Nazi propaganda. To ensure a definitive judgment on the diaries, Hagen, one of the company's lawyers, passed three complete diaries to Henke at the for a more complete forensic examination. While the debate on the diaries' authenticity continued, "Stern" published its special edition on 28 April, which provided Hitler's purported views on the flight of Hess to England, and <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>. The following day Heidemann again met with Kujau, and bought the last four diaries from him.

On the following Sunday—1 May 1983—"The Sunday Times" published further stories providing the background to the diaries, linking them more closely to the plane crash in 1945, and providing a profile of Heidemann. That day, when "<a href="The%20Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>" rang Irving for a further comment on the diaries, he informed them that he now believed the diaries to be genuine; "The Times" ran the story of Irving's U-turn the following day. Irving explained that "Stern" had shown him a diary from April 1945 in which the writing sloped downwards from left to right, and the script of which got smaller along the line. At a subsequent press conference Irving explained that he had been examining the diaries of Dr <a href="Theodor%20Morell">Theodor Morell</a>, Hitler's personal doctor, in which Morell diagnosed the as having <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, a symptom of which was to write in the way the text appeared in the diaries. Harris posits that further motives may also have played a part—the lack of reference to the Holocaust in the diaries may have been perceived by Irving as supporting evidence for his thesis, put forward in his book "Hitler's War", that the Holocaust took place without Hitler's knowledge. The same day Hagen visited the and was told of their findings: <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light had shown a <a href="Fluorescence">fluorescent</a> element to the paper, which should not have been present in an old document, and that the bindings of one of the diaries included polyester which had not been made before 1953. Research in the archives also showed a number of errors. The findings were partial only, and not conclusive; more volumes were provided to aid the analysis.

When Hagen reported back to the "Stern" management, an emergency meeting was called and Schulte-Hillen demanded the identity of Heidemann's source. The journalist relented, and provided the provenance of the diaries as Kujau had given it to him. Harris describes how a <a href="bunker%20mentality">bunker mentality</a> descended on the "Stern" management as, instead of accepting the truth of the 's findings, they searched for alternative explanations as to how post-war whitening agents could have been used in the wartime paper. The paper then released a statement defending their position which Harris judges was "resonant with hollow bravado".

While Koch was touring the US, giving interviews to most of the major news channels, he met <a href="Kenneth%20W.%20Rendell">Kenneth W. Rendell</a>, a handwriting expert in the studios of <a href="CBS">CBS</a>, and showed him one of the volumes. Rendell's first impression was that the diaries were forged. He later reported that "everything looked wrong", including new-looking ink, poor quality paper and signatures that were "terrible renditions" of Hitler's. Rendell concludes the diaries were not particularly good fakes, calling them "bad forgeries but a great hoax". He states that "with the exception of imitating Hitler's habit of slanting his writing diagonally as he wrote across the page, the forger failed to observe or to imitate the most fundamental characteristics of his handwriting."

On 4 May fifteen volumes of the diaries were removed from the Swiss bank vault and distributed to various forensic scientists: four went to the and eleven went to the Swiss specialists in St Gallen. The initial results were ready on 6 May, which confirmed what the forensic experts had been telling the management of "Stern" for the last week: the diaries were poor forgeries, with modern components and ink that was not in common use in wartime Germany. Measurements had been taken of the evaporation of chloride in the ink which showed the diaries had been written within the previous two years. There were also factual errors, including some from Domarus's that Kujau had copied. Before passing the news to Stern, the had already informed the government, saying it was "a ministerial matter". The managers at "Stern" tried to release the first press statement that acknowledged the forensic findings and stated that the diaries were forged, but the official government announcement was released five minutes before "Stern"'s.

Once the government announcement appeared on television, Kujau took his wife and mistress to Austria; he introduced the latter to Edith as his cleaner. After he saw a news report a few days later, naming him as the forger, and hearing that "Stern" had paid nine million DMs, he first phoned his lawyer and then the Hamburg State prosecutor; the forger agreed to hand himself in at the border between Austria and West Germany the following day. When police raided his house, they found several notebooks identical to those used in the fraud. Kujau continued to use a variation of the story he had told Heidemann—that of obtaining the diaries from the East—but he was bitter that the journalist was still at liberty, and had withheld so much of "Stern"'s money from him. After thirteen days, on 26 May, he wrote a full confession, stating that Heidemann knew all along that the diaries were forgeries. Heidemann was arrested that evening.

Following a police investigation that lasted over a year, on 21 August 1984 the trial against Heidemann and Kujau opened in Hamburg. Both men were charged with defrauding "Stern" of 9.3 million DMs. Despite the seriousness of the charges facing the two men, Hamilton considers that "it also appeared clear that the trial was going to be a farce, a real slapstick affair that would enrage the judge and amuse the entire world." The proceedings lasted until July 1985, when both men were sent to prison: four years and eight months for Heidemann, four years and six months for Kujau. In September one of the supporting magistrates overseeing the case was replaced after he fell asleep; three days later the court were "amused" to see pictures of <a href="Idi%20Amin">Idi Amin</a>'s underpants, which Heidemann had framed on his wall. At times the case "denigrated into a slanging match" between Kujau and Heidemann. In his summing up Judge Hans-Ulrich Schroeder said that "the negligence of "Stern" has persuaded me to soften the sentences against the two main co-conspirators." Heidemann was found guilty of stealing 1.7 million DMs from "Stern"; Kujau guilty of receiving 1.5 million DMs for his role in the forgeries. Despite the lengthy investigation and trial, at least five million DMs remained unaccounted for.

When Kujau was released from prison in 1987 he was suffering from throat cancer. He opened a gallery in Stuttgart and sold "forgeries" of <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a> and <a href="Joan%20Mir%C3%B3">Joan Miró</a>, all signed with his own name. Although he prospered, Kujau was later arrested for forging driving licences; he was fined the equivalent of £2,000. He died of cancer in Stuttgart in September 2000.

Heidemann was also released from prison in 1987. Five years later it was reported in the German newspaper "<a href="Der%20Spiegel">Der Spiegel</a>" that in the 1950s he had been recruited by the <a href="Stasi">Stasi</a>, the East German secret police, to monitor the arrival of American nuclear weapons into West Germany. In 2008 he had debts exceeding €700,000, and was living on social security; his situation had not changed by 2013, and he remained bitter about his treatment.

Two of "Stern"s editors, Koch and Schmidt, lost their jobs because of the scandal. Both complained strongly when told that their resignations were expected, pointing out that they had both wanted to sack Heidemann in 1981. A settlement of 3.5 million DMs (c. $1 million) was provided to each of them as part of the severance package. The staff at the magazine were angry at the approach taken by their managers, and held <a href="sit-in">sit-in</a>s to protest at the "management's bypassing traditional editorial channels and safeguards". The scandal caused a major crisis for "Stern" and, according to Esser and Hartung, the magazine "once known for its investigative reporting, became a prime example of sensation-seeking checkbook journalism". "Stern"s credibility was severely damaged and it took the magazine ten years to regain its pre-scandal status and reputation. According to the <a href="German%20Historical%20Institute">German Historical Institute</a>, the scandal was also "instrumental in discrediting the tendency toward an 'unprejudiced' and euphemistic assessment of the Third Reich in West German popular culture".

At the Sunday Times, Murdoch moved Giles to the new position of "editor emeritus". When Giles asked what the title meant, Murdoch informed him that "It's Latin, Frank; the "e" means you're out and the "meritus" means you deserved it." Murdoch later said that "circulation went up and it stayed up. We didn't lose money or anything like that", referring to the 20,000 new readers the paper retained after the scandal broke, and the fact that "Stern" returned all the money paid to it by the "Sunday Times". In April 2012, during the <a href="Leveson%20Inquiry">Leveson Inquiry</a>, he acknowledged his role in publishing the diaries, and took the blame for making the decision, saying "It was a massive mistake I made and I will have to live with it for the rest of my life." Trevor-Roper died in 2003. Despite a long and respected career as a historian, according to <a href="Richard%20Davenport-Hines">Richard Davenport-Hines</a>, his biographer, Trevor-Roper's role in the scandal left his reputation "permanently besmirched". In January 1984 Broyles resigned as editor of "Newsweek", to "pursue new entrepreneurial ventures".

In 1986 the journalist <a href="Robert%20Harris%20%28novelist%29">Robert Harris</a> published an account of the hoax, "Selling Hitler: The Story of the Hitler Diaries". Five years later "<a href="Selling%20Hitler">Selling Hitler</a>", a five-episode drama-documentary series based on Harris's book, was broadcast on the British <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> channel. It starred <a href="Jonathan%20Pryce">Jonathan Pryce</a> as Heidemann, <a href="Alexei%20Sayle">Alexei Sayle</a> as Kujau, <a href="Tom%20Baker">Tom Baker</a> as Fischer, <a href="Alan%20Bennett">Alan Bennett</a> as Trevor-Roper, <a href="Roger%20Lloyd-Pack">Roger Lloyd-Pack</a> as Irving, <a href="Richard%20Wilson%20%28Scottish%20actor%29">Richard Wilson</a> as Nannen and <a href="Barry%20Humphries">Barry Humphries</a> as Murdoch. Later that year Charles Hamilton published the second book to investigate the forgeries: "The Hitler Diaries". In 1992 the story of the diaries was adapted to the big screen by <a href="Helmut%20Dietl">Helmut Dietl</a>, in his satirical German-language film "<a href="Schtonk%21">Schtonk!</a>" The film, which starred <a href="G%C3%B6tz%20George">Götz George</a> as Heidemann and <a href="Uwe%20Ochsenknecht">Uwe Ochsenknecht</a> as Kujau, won three <a href="Deutscher%20Filmpreis">Deutscher Filmpreis</a> awards, and nominations for a <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a> and an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>.

In 2004 one of the diaries was sold at auction for €6,400 to an unknown buyer; the remainder were handed over by "Stern" to the in 2013, not as a memento of the Nazi past, but as an example of news media history. One of the "Sunday Times" journalists involved in the story, <a href="Brian%20MacArthur">Brian MacArthur</a>, later explained why so many experienced journalists and businessmen "were so gullible" about the authenticity of the diaries:

...  the discovery of the Hitler diaries offered so tempting a scoop that we all wanted to believe they were genuine. Once hoist with a deal, moreover, we had to go on believing in their authenticity until they were convincingly demonstrated as forgeries. ... The few of us who were in on the secret fed in the adrenalin: we were going to write the most stunning scoop of our careers.

Battle of Tippecanoe

The Battle of Tippecanoe ( ) was fought on November 7, 1811 in <a href="Battle%20Ground%2C%20Indiana">Battle Ground, Indiana</a> between American forces led by Governor <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> of the <a href="Indiana%20Territory">Indiana Territory</a> and Indian forces associated with <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a> leader <a href="Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a> and his brother <a href="Tenskwatawa">Tenskwatawa</a> (commonly known as "The Prophet"), leaders of a <a href="Tecumseh%27s%20Confederacy">confederacy</a> of various tribes who opposed settlement of the American West. As tensions and violence increased, Governor Harrison marched with an army of about 1,000 men to disperse the confederacy's headquarters at <a href="Prophetstown%20State%20Park">Prophetstown</a>, near the confluence of the <a href="Tippecanoe%20River">Tippecanoe River</a> and the <a href="Wabash%20River">Wabash River</a>.

Tecumseh was not yet ready to oppose the United States by force and was away recruiting allies when Harrison's army arrived. Tenskwatawa was a spiritual leader but not a military man, and he was in charge. Harrison camped near Prophetstown on November 6 and arranged to meet with Tenskwatawa the following day. Early the next morning, however, warriors from Prophetstown attacked Harrison's army. They took the army by surprise, but Harrison and his men stood their ground for more than two hours. The Indians were ultimately repulsed when their ammunition ran low. After the battle, they abandoned Prophetstown and Harrison's men burned it to the ground, destroying the food supplies stored for the winter. The soldiers then returned to their homes.

Harrison accomplished his goal of destroying Prophetstown and proclaimed that he had won a decisive victory. He gained the nickname "Tippecanoe", which was popularized in the campaign song "<a href="Tippecanoe%20and%20Tyler%20too">Tippecanoe and Tyler too</a>" during the presidential election of 1840 which Harrison won. The defeat was a setback for Tecumseh's confederacy from which it never fully recovered.

Americans blamed the violence on British interference in American affairs because they had supplied the Indians with financial support and ammunition. This led to a further deterioration of relations with Britain and was a catalyst of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, which began six months later. The US declared war on the United Kingdom in June 1812, and Tecumseh's confederacy was ready to launch its war against the United States in alliance with the British. In preparation, the Indians rebuilt Prophetstown. Frontier violence in the region continued until well after the War of 1812, although Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a>.

<a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> was appointed governor of the newly formed <a href="Indiana%20Territory">Indiana Territory</a> in 1800, and he sought to secure title to the area for settlement. In particular, he hoped that the Indiana Territory would attract enough settlers to qualify for statehood. He negotiated numerous land cession treaties with American Indians, including the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Wayne%20%281809%29">Treaty of Fort Wayne</a> on September 30, 1809 in which <a href="Miami%20people">Miami</a>, <a href="Pottawatomie">Pottawatomie</a>, <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a>, and other tribal leaders sold 3,000,000 acres (approximately 12,000 km²) to the United States.

<a href="Tenskwatawa">Tenskwatawa</a> was known as the Prophet and had been leading a religious movement among the northwestern tribes, calling for a return to the ancestral ways. His brother <a href="Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a> was outraged by the Treaty of Fort Wayne, and he revived an idea advocated previously by <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a> leader <a href="Blue%20Jacket">Blue Jacket</a> and <a href="Mohawk%20nation">Mohawk</a> leader <a href="Joseph%20Brant">Joseph Brant</a>, which stated that Indian land was owned in common by all tribes, and land could not be sold without agreement by all the tribes.

Tecumseh was not ready to confront the United States directly, and he found that he was opposed by the Indian leaders who had signed the treaty. He threatened to kill anyone and their followers who carried out the terms of the treaty, and he traveled widely, urging warriors to abandon their chiefs and join his resistance at Prophetstown, insisting that the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate. He met with Governor Harrison in 1810 and demanded that Harrison nullify the treaty, and he warned that settlers should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Harrison rejected his demands and insisted that the tribes could have individual relations with the United States. Tecumseh warned him that he would seek an alliance with the British if hostilities broke out. 

Tensions had been high for several months between the United States and Britain as a result of British <a href="Origins%20of%20the%20War%20of%201812">interference in American commerce</a> with France. As early as 1810, British agents had sought to secure an alliance with Indians to assist in the defense of Canada should hostilities break out, but the Indians had been reluctant to accept their offer, fearing that they had little to benefit from such an arrangement.

In August 1811, Tecumseh again met with Harrison at <a href="Vincennes%2C%20Indiana">Vincennes, Indiana</a>, and he assured Harrison that the Shawnee brothers meant to remain at peace with the United States. Tecumseh then traveled to the Southeast on a mission to recruit allies among the "<a href="Five%20Civilized%20Tribes">Five Civilized Tribes</a>". Most of the southern tribes rejected his appeals, but a faction of the <a href="Creek%20people">Creek people</a> answered his call to arms and became known as the <a href="Red%20Sticks">Red Sticks</a>. They led the <a href="Creek%20War">Creek War</a>, an internal war among factions that were divided over adoption of some American ways. This became a part of the War of 1812, as the Red Sticks opposed the United States. By contrast, the Creek of the Lower Towns were more integrated with American culture and supported the US against Britain.

Harrison left the territory for business in Kentucky shortly after the meeting with Tecumseh, and secretary <a href="John%20Gibson%20%28Indiana%29">John Gibson</a> was acting governor. Gibson had lived among the Miami tribe for many years and quickly learned of Tecumseh's plans for war. He immediately called out the territory's militia and sent emergency letters calling for the return of Harrison. Most of the militia regiments had formed by mid-September and Harrison had returned, accompanied by a small force of army regulars, and he took command. He had already communicated with his superiors in Washington, D.C., and he was authorized to march against the confederacy in a show of force in the hopes that its members would accept peace.

Harrison gathered the scattered militia companies at Fort Knox near a settlement on Maria Creek north of Vincennes. He was joined by a 60-man company called the <a href="Yellow%20Jackets%20%28Indiana%29">Yellow Jackets</a> from <a href="Corydon%2C%20Indiana">Corydon, Indiana</a>, named for their bright yellow coats, as well as the <a href="Indiana%20Rangers">Indiana Rangers</a>.

The force of about 1,000 men set out north towards Prophetstown, consisting of about 250 army regulars from the 4th US Infantry Regiment, 100 Kentucky volunteers, and nearly 600 Indiana militia, including two companies of the Indiana Rangers. They reached <a href="Terre%20Haute%2C%20Indiana">Terre Haute, Indiana</a> on October 3, where they camped and built <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Harrison">Fort Harrison</a> while waiting for supplies to be delivered. A scouting party of Yellow Jackets was ambushed by Indians on October 10, resulting in several casualties. The Americans stopped foraging, and supplies quickly began to run low. By October 19, officers cut the rations, and the men survived on low rations until October 28, when fresh supplies arrived via the <a href="Wabash%20River">Wabash River</a> from Vincennes. With the army resupplied, Harrison resumed his advance to Prophetstown on October 29.

Harrison's forces approached Prophetstown late on November 6 and were met by one of Tenskwatawa's followers waving a white flag. He carried a message from Tenskwatawa, requesting a ceasefire until the next day when the two sides could hold a peaceful meeting. Harrison agreed to a meeting but was wary of Tenskwatawa's overture, believing that the negotiations would be futile. He moved his army to a hill near the confluence of the upper Wabash and <a href="Tippecanoe%20River">Tippecanoe</a> rivers where he camped his men in battle array, and he kept sentinels on duty during the night.
Burnett Creek was on the west side of the hill, and a very steep embankment was on the east side, so Harrison did not order temporary works to be created around the position, as was ordinarily done by encamped armies. The Yellow Jacket company was posted on the southern end of the camp perimeter, with Captain <a href="Spier%20Spencer">Spier Spencer</a> in command, and the rest of the militia established a rectangular formation along the edges of the bluff surrounding the camp. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bartholomew commanded the Indiana militia units guarding the steep bluff on the eastern side of the formation, and the regulars and dragoons were kept in reserve behind the main line, commanded by Major Floyd, Maj. <a href="Joseph%20Hamilton%20Daveiss">Joseph Hamilton Daveiss</a>, and former congressman Capt. <a href="Benjamin%20Parke">Benjamin Parke</a>.

Tenskwatawa told Michigan Governor <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a> in 1816 that he did not order his warriors to attack Harrison, and he blamed the <a href="Ho-Chunk">Ho-Chunk</a> (Winnebago) warriors in his camp for launching the attack. Other accounts also blame the Ho-Chunk for encouraging the attack and suggest that Tenskwatawa was unable to control his followers as panic set in. Tenskwatawa's followers were worried by the nearby army and feared an imminent attack. They had begun to fortify the town but had not completed their defenses. During the evening, Tenskwatawa decided that sending a party to murder Harrison in his tent was the best way to avoid a battle. He assured the warriors that he would cast spells that would prevent them from being harmed and would confuse Harrison's army so that they would not resist. The warriors began to surround Harrison's army, looking for a way to enter the camp undetected. A man named Ben was a wagon driver traveling with Harrison's army, and he had deserted to the Shawnees during the expedition. He agreed to lead a group of warriors through the line to Harrison's tent during the late night hours, but he was captured by the camp sentries, taken back to camp, and bound. He was later convicted of treason, but Harrison pardoned him.

Accounts are unclear about how the battle began, but Harrison's sentinels encountered advancing warriors in the pre-dawn hours of November 7. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Bartholomew was officer of the day, and he had ordered the troops to sleep with their weapons loaded. Around 4:30 a.m., the soldiers awoke to scattered gunshots and found that they were nearly encircled by Tenskwatawa's forces. Contact was first made on the northern end of the perimeter, but the movement was probably intended as a diversion. Shortly after the first shots, fierce fighting broke out on the opposite end as the warriors charged Harrison's line on the southern corner. The militia's small-caliber rifles had little effect on the warriors as they rushed the defenders. Spencer was among the first to be killed, shot in each thigh. Governor Harrison later recorded his death in a dispatch to Washington:
Spencer was wounded in the head. He exhorted his men to fight valiantly. He was shot through both thighs and fell; still continuing to encourage them, he was raised up, and received a ball through his body, which put an immediate end to his existence.

The remaining Yellow Jacket officers were Lieutenants Nuge and Klaus, but they were also shot and killed and the Yellow Jackets began to fall back from the main line, retreating with the sentinels. The Indians followed the retreating unit and entered the camp, but Colonel Bartholomew requested a detachment of 25 regular troops and led a bayonet charge which repulsed them. During that charge, Bartholomew was shot through the lower arm, breaking both bones, but he was still clutching his sword when he was treated hours later. He was later promoted to brigadier general in recognition of his leadership during the battle. The soldiers regrouped under the command of ensign <a href="John%20Tipton">John Tipton</a> with the help of two reserve companies under the command of Captain Robb, and they sealed the breach in the line.

The second Indian charge was made against the north and south ends of the camp, with the far southern end the hardest hit. Over half of Harrison's casualties were suffered among the companies on the southern end, including Captain Spencer, five men in his company, and seven men in the adjoining company. The Americans held their position as the attacks continued, the regulars reinforcing that critical section of the line. On the northern end of the camp, Major Daveiss led the dragoons on a counter-charge which punched through the Indian line before being repulsed. Most of Daveiss' company retreated to Harrison's main line, but Daveiss was killed. Throughout the next hour, Harrison's troops fought off several more charges. The Indians began to run low on ammunition, and the rising sun revealed the small size of Tenskwatawa's forces, so the Indians began to slowly withdraw; a second charge by the dragoons forced the Indians to flee.

The battle lasted about two hours and Harrison lost 62 men, with 37 killed in action and 25 mortally wounded; about 126 were less seriously hurt. The Yellow Jackets suffered the highest casualties of the battle, with 30-percent of their numbers killed or wounded. The number of Indian casualties is still the subject of debate, but it was certainly lower than that of the American forces. Historians estimate that as many as 50 were killed and about 70 to 80 were wounded.

The warriors retreated to Prophetstown where, according to one chief's account, the warriors confronted Tenskwatawa. They accused him of deceit because of the many deaths, which his spells were supposed to have prevented. He blamed his wife for desecrating his magic medicine and offered to cast a new spell; he insisted that the warriors launch a second attack, but they refused.

Fearing Tecumseh's imminent return with reinforcements, Harrison ordered his men to fortify their camp with works for the rest of the day. As the sentries moved back out, they discovered and <a href="Scalping">scalped</a> the bodies of 36 warriors. The following day, November 8, Harrison sent a small group of men to inspect the Shawnee town and found it was deserted except for one elderly woman too sick to flee. The remainder of the defeated Natives had evacuated the village during the night. Harrison ordered his troops to spare the woman, but to burn down Prophetstown and destroy the Native Americans' cooking implements, without which the confederacy would be hard pressed to survive the winter. Everything of value was confiscated, including 5,000 bushels of corn and beans stored for winter. Some of Harrison's soldiers dug up bodies from the graveyard in Prophetstown to scalp.

Harrison's troops buried their own dead on the site of their camp. They built large fires over the mass grave in an attempt to conceal it from the Native Americans. After Harrison's troops departed the area, the Native Americans returned to the grave site, digging up many of the corpses in retaliation and scattering the bodies.

The day after the battle, the American wounded were loaded onto wagons and carried back to Fort Harrison for medical care. Most of the militia were released from duty on November 9 and returned home, but many of the long-time soldiers remained in the area. Harrison informed Secretary <a href="William%20Eustis">William Eustis</a> of a battle near the Tippecanoe River, giving the battle the river's name; he added that he feared an imminent reprisal. The first dispatch did not make clear which side had won the conflict, and the secretary interpreted it as a defeat. The follow-up dispatch made the American victory clear, and the defeat of Tecumseh's confederacy became more certain when no second attack occurred. Eustis replied with a lengthy note demanding to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp. Harrison replied that he had considered the position strong enough without fortification. This dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War, and he resigned from the army in 1814 as a result.

At first, newspapers carried little information about the battle, as they were focused on the highlights of the on-going <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> in Europe. A Louisville, Kentucky newspaper printed a copy of Harrison's first dispatch and characterized the battle as a defeat for the United States; however, most major American newspapers began to carry stories about the battle by December. Public outrage quickly grew and many Americans blamed the British for inciting the tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms. <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> was at the forefront of those calling for war, saying that Tecumseh and his allies were "excited by secret British agents", and other western governors called for action. <a href="Willie%20Blount">Willie Blount</a> of Tennessee called on the government to "purge the camps of Indians of every Englishmen to be found", and Congress passed resolutions condemning the British for interfering in the United States' domestic affairs. This connection between Tecumseh's rise and British influence led to a growing resentment against British meddling and led to the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>.

Historians have long believed that Tecumseh was furious with Tenskwatawa for losing the battle, and that Tecumseh had threatened to kill his brother for making the attack. Tenskwatawa lost prestige after the battle and no longer served as a leader of the confederacy. In their subsequent meetings with Harrison, several Indian leaders claimed that Tenskwatawa's influence was destroyed; some accounts said that he was being persecuted by other leaders. (Historians <a href="Alfred%20A.%20Cave">Alfred A. Cave</a> and Robert Owens have argued that the Indians were trying to mislead Harrison in an attempt to calm the situation, and that Tenskwatawa continued to play an important role in the confederacy.)

Harrison claimed that he had won a decisive victory, but some modern historians raise doubts. "In none of the [contemporaneous] reports from Indian agents, traders, and public officials on the aftermath of Tippecanoe can we find confirmation of the claim that Harrison had won a decisive victory", according to Alfred Cave. The defeat was a setback for Tecumseh's confederacy, although they rebuilt Prophetstown, and Indian violence increased on the frontier after the battle. Adam Jortner says that the battle was a disaster for both sides, except in strengthening Tenskwatawa's religious movement.

On December 16, 1811, the first of the <a href="1811%E2%80%9312%20New%20Madrid%20earthquakes">New Madrid earthquakes</a> shook the South and the Midwest. Many Indians took the earthquake as a sign that Tenskwatawa's predictions of doom were coming true, and they supported Tecumseh in greater number, including many of his former detractors. They increased their attacks against American settlers and against isolated outposts in Indiana and the <a href="Illinois%20Territory">Illinois Territory</a>, resulting in the deaths of many civilians. The Shawnee partially rebuilt Prophetstown over the next year, but it was destroyed by in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wild%20Cat%20Creek">Battle of Wild Cat Creek</a> in 1812. Tecumseh continued to play a major role in military operations on the frontier. By the time that the U.S. declared war on Great Britain in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, Tecumseh's confederacy was ready to launch its own war against the United States—this time with British's open alliance. Tecumseh's warriors made up nearly half of the British forces that captured Detroit from the United States in the War of 1812, and it was not until Tecumseh's death at the 1813 <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a> that his confederacy ceased to threaten the Americans.

William Henry Harrison ran for President in 1840, and he used the slogan "<a href="Tippecanoe%20and%20Tyler%20Too">Tippecanoe and Tyler Too</a>" to remind people of his heroism during the battle.

The participants in the battle received the Thanks of Congress. The resolution originally included William Henry Harrison by name, but his name was removed before passage. Harrison considered this to be an insult, thinking that Congress implied that he was the one person in the campaign not worthy of accolades, and he suggested that it held him up to obloquy and disrespect. He was, however, awarded the Thanks of Congress and a <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a> in 1818 for victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a>.

Harrison returned to the battlefield in 1835 to give speeches during his first presidential campaign, and he called for the creation of a memorial to preserve the battle site. John Tipton later purchased the land to preserve it, and the Methodist Church purchased the mission school on the hill and used it as a seminary. Tipton left the battlefield to the seminary in his will, and they maintained it for many years, building a larger facility at the location in 1862. Harrison and the battle were memorialized by two Ohio towns being named <a href="Tippecanoe%2C%20Ohio">Tippecanoe</a>; one changed its name to <a href="Tipp%20City%2C%20Ohio">Tipp City, Ohio</a> in 1938. 

In 1908, the Indiana General Assembly commissioned an high obelisk memorial at the battleground. On October 9, 1960, the <a href="Tippecanoe%20Battlefield%20Park">Tippecanoe Battlefield</a> was named a national historic landmark. In 1961, some 10,000 people attended the 150th anniversary of the battle.

In the following years, the battle site attracted fewer visitors and fell into disrepair, and the Tippecanoe County Historical Association now maintains the battleground and the seminary building, housing a museum about the battle. They added an amphitheater to the memorial in 1986 which was used for performances of "The <a href="Battle%20of%20Tippecanoe%20Outdoor%20Drama">Battle of Tippecanoe Outdoor Drama</a>" in 1989 and 1990.

Robinson</a> upon Robinson's death in 1937. During his 1938 re-election bid, his opponent <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a> accused him of using <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a> employees to campaign for him; Barkley claimed Chandler used state employees in the same way. Neither candidate was charged with any wrongdoing, but in 1939, Congress passed the <a href="Hatch%20Act%20of%201939">Hatch Act</a>, making it illegal for federal employees to campaign for political candidates.

When <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> focused President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s attention on foreign affairs, Barkley gained influence over the administration's domestic agenda. He resigned as floor leader after Roosevelt ignored his advice and vetoed the <a href="Revenue%20Act%20of%201943">Revenue Act of 1943</a>. The veto was overridden and the Democratic caucus supported and unanimously re-elected Barkley to the position of Majority Leader. Barkley had a good working relationship with <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>, who ascended to the presidency after Roosevelt's death in 1945. With Truman's popularity waning entering the <a href="1948%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1948 Democratic National Convention</a>, Barkley gave a <a href="keynote%20address">keynote address</a> that energized the delegates. Truman selected him as his running mate for the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201948">upcoming election</a> and the Democratic ticket scored an upset victory. Barkley took an active role in the Truman administration, acting as its primary spokesman, especially after the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> necessitated the majority of Truman's attention. When Truman announced that he would not seek re-election in 1952, Barkley began organizing a presidential campaign, but <a href="Trade%20union">labor leaders</a> refused to endorse his candidacy because of his age, and he withdrew from the race. He retired but was coaxed back into public life, defeating incumbent Republican Senator <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper">John Sherman Cooper</a> in 1954. Barkley died of a heart attack while giving a speech at the <a href="Washington%20and%20Lee%20Mock%20Convention">Washington and Lee Mock Convention</a> on April 30, 1956.

Willie Alben Barkley, the eldest of John Wilson and Electa Eliza (Smith) Barkley's eight children, was born November 24, 1877. His grandmother, <a href="midwife">midwife</a> Amanda Barkley, delivered him in the log house she lived in with her husband, Alben, in <a href="Wheel%2C%20Kentucky">Wheel, Kentucky</a>. Barkley's parents were <a href="tenant%20farmer">tenant farmer</a>s who grew tobacco, and his father was an elder in the local <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> church. Both parents were religious, opposed to playing cards and alcohol. Occasionally, Barkley's parents would leave him in the care of his grandparents for extended periods. During these times, his grandmother related stories of her relatives. Her childhood playmates included future U.S. Vice President <a href="Adlai%20Stevenson%20I">Adlai Stevenson I</a> and <a href="James%20A.%20McKenzie">James A. McKenzie</a>, a future U.S. Representative from Kentucky.

Barkley worked on his parents' farm and attended school in <a href="Lowes%2C%20Kentucky">Lowes, Kentucky</a>, between the fall harvest and spring planting. Unhappy with his birth name, he adopted "Alben William" as soon as he was old enough to express his opinion in the matter. In the difficult economy of late 1891, relatives convinced Barkley's father to sell his farm and move to <a href="Clinton%2C%20Kentucky">Clinton</a>, to pursue opportunities as a tenant wheat farmer. Barkley enrolled at a local seminary school, but did not finish his studies before entering Marvin College, a <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> school in Clinton that accepted younger students, in 1892. The college's president offered him a scholarship that covered his academic expenses in exchange for his work as a janitor. He allowed Barkley to miss the first and last month of the academic year to help on the family farm. Barkley was active in the debating society at Marvin. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1897, and his experiences at Marvin persuaded him to convert to Methodism, the denomination with which he identified for the rest of his life.

After graduation, Barkley went to <a href="Oxford%20College%20of%20Emory%20University">Emory College</a> (now part of <a href="Emory%20University">Emory University</a>) in <a href="Oxford%2C%20Georgia">Oxford, Georgia</a>, the "alma mater" of several administrators and faculty members at Marvin. During the 1897–1898 academic year, he was active in the debating society and the <a href="Delta%20Tau%20Delta">Delta Tau Delta</a> fraternity, but he could not afford to continue his education and returned to Clinton after the spring semester. He took a job teaching at Marvin College but did not make enough money to meet his basic living expenses. He resigned in December 1898 to move with his parents to <a href="Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">Paducah, Kentucky</a>, the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of <a href="McCracken%20County%2C%20Kentucky">McCracken County</a>, where his father found employment at a cordage mill.

In Paducah, Barkley worked as a law clerk for <a href="Charles%20K.%20Wheeler">Charles K. Wheeler</a>, an attorney and congressman for the district, accepting access to Wheeler's law library as payment for his services. Despite their political differences – Wheeler supported <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> and <a href="Free%20Silver">Free Silver</a>, while Barkley identified with the <a href="Gold%20Democrats">Gold Democrats</a> – he hoped that being acquainted with and taught by Wheeler would aid him in his future endeavors, but congressional duties frequently kept Wheeler away from the office. After two months, Barkley accepted an offer to clerk for Judge William Sutton Bishop and former congressman <a href="John%20Kerr%20Hendrick">John Kerr Hendrick</a>, who paid him $15 per month. He <a href="reading%20law">read law</a> while completing his duties and <a href="Admission%20to%20the%20bar%20in%20the%20United%20States">was admitted to the bar</a> in 1901. Barkley practiced in Paducah where a friend of Hendrick's appointed him reporter of the <a href="Kentucky%20Circuit%20Courts">circuit court</a>. He continued studying law in the summer of 1902 at the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia%20School%20of%20Law">University of Virginia School of Law</a>.

Barkley joined the Broadway Methodist Episcopal Church, where he was a lay preacher, and several fraternal organizations, including <a href="Woodmen%20of%20the%20World">Woodmen of the World</a>, the <a href="Benevolent%20and%20Protective%20Order%20of%20Elks">Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks</a>, the <a href="Independent%20Order%20of%20Odd%20Fellows">Independent Order of Odd Fellows</a>, and the <a href="Improved%20Order%20of%20Red%20Men">Improved Order of Red Men</a>. On June 23, 1903, he married Dorothy Brower (November 14, 1882 – March 10, 1947). They had three children; David Murrell Barkley (1906–1983), Marion Frances Barkley (1909–1996), and Laura Louise Barkley (1911–1987). Laura Louise married <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur%20II">Douglas MacArthur II</a>, a U.S. diplomat and nephew of General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>.

On December 19, 1904, Barkley declared his candidacy for <a href="county%20attorney">county attorney</a> of McCracken County well before the March 1905 <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> <a href="primary%20election">primary</a>. The <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> did not nominate a candidate, so the Democratic primary was the "de facto" general election. Barkley faced two opponents in the primary – two-term incumbent Eugene A. Graves and Paducah Police Court Judge David Cross. He organized his own campaign and made speeches across the county, showcasing his eloquence and likeability. Graves received more votes than Barkley in Paducah, but McCracken County's rural farmers gave Barkley the victory, 1,525 votes to 1,096; Cross came in third with 602 votes. This was the only time Barkley ever challenged an incumbent Democrat.

Taking office in January 1906, Barkley saved taxpayers over $35,000 by challenging improper charges to the county. He prosecuted two magistrates for approving contracts in which they had a <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a>. Even Republicans admitted that he performed well, and he was chosen president of the State Association of County Attorneys. During the 1907 gubernatorial election, he was the Democratic county spokesman, and despite his previous support for the Gold Democrats, he backed William Jennings Bryan in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201908">1908 presidential election</a>. Friends encouraged him to run for county judge, a powerful position which controlled county funds and patronage, and he announced his candidacy on August 22, 1908. After the chairman of the county's Democratic Club Executive Committee endorsed him, the incumbent judge, Richard T. Lightfoot, retired rather than challenge him.

On January 16, 1909, Democrat Hiram Smedley, county clerk since 1897, was indicted for embezzlement. Smedley resigned, and Barkley was appointed to a three-man commission to investigate the losses. The commission found $1,582.50 missing, and the county's <a href="Fiscal%20Court">Fiscal Court</a> authorized Barkley to settle with the company that held Smedley's <a href="surety%20bond">surety bond</a>. In May 1909, Smedley was arrested and charged with 20 counts of forgery, prompting an audit of the county's finances that showed a shortage of $16,000, only $6,000 of which was accountable to Smedley. The scandal gave Republicans an issue for the upcoming campaign. In a series of debates, Barkley's opponent, Thomas N. Hazelip, claimed that the county's entire Democratic organization was corrupt and made charges against past Democratic administrations. Barkley responded that he had no more responsibility for those wrongdoings than Hazelip had for the murder of <a href="William%20Goebel">William Goebel</a>, a Democratic governor who had allegedly been assassinated by Republican conspirators in 1900. He pointed to his improvement of the county's finances through inspection of charges presented to his office and showed evidence that he had fulfilled his obligations as county attorney, a fact Hazelip conceded. In spite of the scandal, Democrats won every county-wide office, although by reduced margins, but Republicans captured a 5-to-3 majority on the Fiscal Court. Barkley's victory margin—3,184 to 2,662—was the smallest of any county officer.

At the Fiscal Court's January 1910 meeting, Barkley laid out an agenda to reduce the county's debt, improve its roads, and audit its books annually. Despite the Republican majority on the Court, most of the measures he proposed during his term were adopted. He appointed a purchasing agent and an inspector of weights and measures for the county and allocated a salary for the county's almshouse keeper instead of relying on fees to fund the position. He replaced the <a href="corv%C3%A9e">corvée</a> system – wherein residents either paid a tax or donated labor to build and repair county roads – with private contracts. The widening and gravelling of county roads provided rural residents access to Paducah's amenities but reduced funds for programs like free textbooks for indigents and prevented Barkley from reducing the county's debt as planned. When he named his father as the county's juvenile court probation officer, opponents charged him with nepotism.

Prompted by <a href="Kentucky%27s%201st%20congressional%20district">First District</a> Representative <a href="Ollie%20M.%20James">Ollie M. James</a>' decision to seek election to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> in 1912, Barkley declared his candidacy for the district's congressional seat in December 1911. Courting the votes of the district's farmers, Barkley advocated lower taxes and increased regulation of railroads by the <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Commission">Interstate Commerce Commission</a>. After one challenger withdrew in March, three more candidates entered the race – <a href="Trigg%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Trigg County</a> <a href="Commonwealth%27s%20Attorney">Commonwealth's Attorney</a> Denny Smith, <a href="Ballard%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Ballard County</a> Judge Jacob Corbett, and John K. Hendrick, Barkley's former employer. All were conservative Democrats who branded Barkley a socialist because he supported federal funding of highway construction. Hendrick attacked Barkley's youth, inexperience and ambition to seek higher offices. Barkley admitted his eventual desire for a Senate seat and countered that Hendrick had also frequently sought office: "When the Pope died some years ago, nobody would tell Hendrick, for fear he would declare for that office." Charging that Barkley's membership in Woodsmen of the World was politically motivated, Hendrick ended up attacking the organization itself, angering the approximately 5,000 club members in the First District. In June, the nomination of <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> for president and adoption of a progressive platform at the <a href="1912%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1912 Democratic National Convention</a> bolstered Barkley's candidacy. He won 48.2% of the votes in the primary and went on to win the general election.

Initially conservative, working with Wilson (who was elected president) inspired Barkley to become more liberal. On April 24, 1913, he first spoke on the House floor, favoring the administration-backed <a href="Revenue%20Act%20of%201913">Underwood–Simmons Tariff Act</a> which lowered tariffs on foreign goods. He endorsed Wilson's <a href="The%20New%20Freedom">New Freedom</a> agenda, including the 1913 <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Act">Federal Reserve Act</a> and the 1914 <a href="Federal%20Trade%20Commission%20Act">Federal Trade Commission Act</a>. Because of his support for the administration, he was assigned to the powerful <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Energy%20and%20Commerce">Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee</a> and became the first freshman to preside over a session of the House. As a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission, he supported the <a href="Clayton%20Antitrust%20Act">Clayton Antitrust Act</a> and sought to end <a href="child%20labor">child labor</a> in interstate commerce through the <a href="Keating%E2%80%93Owen%20Act">Keating–Owen Act</a> in 1916. He also supported measures to extend credit to and fund road improvements in rural areas.

A speaker for the <a href="Anti-Saloon%20League">Anti-Saloon League</a>, Barkley co-sponsored the 1916 <a href="Sheppard%E2%80%93Barkley%20Act">Sheppard–Barkley Act</a> which banned alcohol sales in Washington, D.C. It was passed in 1917. He sponsored an amendment to the <a href="Food%20and%20Fuel%20Control%20Act">Lever Food and Fuel Act</a> forbidding the use of grain – rendered scarce by <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and a poor harvest in 1916 – to make alcoholic beverages. The amendment passed the House, but a <a href="conference%20committee">conference committee</a> amended it to allow production of beer and wine. Both measures increased Barkley's national visibility and set the stage for future prohibition legislation, including the <a href="Eighteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Eighteenth Amendment</a>. By 1917, the state Democratic Party was divided over prohibition, and the prohibitionist faction tried to enlist Barkley for the 1919 gubernatorial race. The <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis</a> "<a href="The%20Commercial%20Appeal">Commercial Appeal</a>" noted in late 1917 that Barkley had not declined the invitations, but his continued silence reduced the prohibitionists' enthusiasm. He also showed little interest in the faction's attempts to recruit him to challenge incumbent anti-prohibition Senator Ollie James in the 1917 Democratic primary.

By 1919, James had died in office and Governor <a href="Augustus%20Owsley%20Stanley">Augustus Owsley Stanley</a> was elected to his vacant seat. The divisive prohibition issue and recent Republican gains in the state made the Democratic gubernatorial primary of particular interest. Stanley was the leader of the party's anti-prohibitionists. Prohibitionists, led by former governor <a href="J.%20C.%20W.%20Beckham">J. C. W. Beckham</a>, did not support <a href="James%20D.%20Black">James D. Black</a>, who became governor when Stanley went to the Senate and was seeking re-election. At the time of Black's election as <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a> in 1915, he had sided with the prohibitionists; he was chosen to run with Stanley to balance the party's ticket, so the anti-prohibitionists did not entirely trust him either. Attempting to unite the party and prevent a Republican victory, Black invited Barkley, who had not been linked to either leader despite his support for prohibition, to be temporary chairman of the 1919 state Democratic convention. Barkley's convention address attacked Republicans and praised the Democrats' record without making reference to prohibition, but many in the Beckham faction refused to accept Black, and he was defeated in the general election by Republican <a href="Edwin%20P.%20Morrow">Edwin P. Morrow</a>. Chairing the convention introduced Barkley to state political leaders outside the First District.

Barkley supported U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson's plan to purchase merchant ships for the U.S. instead of paying foreign carriers to travel waters containing German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s. His position was popular in his district, as 80% of the dark tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs adversely affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, but Republicans and conservative Democrats in the Senate regarded the idea as socialistic and blocked its passage with a <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a>.

Wilson supporters, including Barkley, campaigned for his <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201916">re-election in 1916</a>, using the slogan "he kept us out of war". By early 1917, Germany had lifted all restrictions on attacks on neutral shipping supplying Britain and France, outraging many Americans. The publication in February of the <a href="Zimmermann%20Telegram">Zimmermann Telegram</a>, in which a German official proposed to Mexico that, if the U.S. entered the war, Mexico should declare war on them and the Germans would work to return <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, and <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> to Mexican control, also brought the United States closer to war. Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war on April 2, 1917, and Barkley voted for the resolution when it came before the House two weeks later. At 40 years old, he considered resigning his seat to enlist in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a>, but Wilson persuaded him not to do so.

After the declaration of war, Barkley supported bills implementing <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">conscription</a> and raising revenue for the fight. Between August and October 1918, he joined an unofficial congressional delegation that toured Europe, surveying the tactical situation and meeting with leaders there. Like Wilson, he supported U.S. ratification of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> and participation in the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>, but both measures failed after the election of a more conservative Congress in <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201918">1918</a>.

Barkley supported <a href="William%20Gibbs%20McAdoo">William Gibbs McAdoo</a> for president at the <a href="1920%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1920 Democratic National Convention</a>, but the nomination went to <a href="James%20M.%20Cox">James M. Cox</a>. He campaigned for Cox and his running mate, <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, but his speeches focused more on Wilson's progressive record than Cox's fitness for office. Republican <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> defeated Cox in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201920">the general election</a>, and Barkley found common ground with him on issues such as the creation of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Veterans%20Affairs">Veterans' Bureau</a> and the passage of the progressive <a href="Sheppard%E2%80%93Towner%20Act">Sheppard–Towner Act</a>. Barkley thought the administration was too favorable to big business interests, however, and in 1922, he proclaimed that if Harding had <a href="Return%20to%20normalcy">returned the country to normalcy</a>, "then in God's name let us have Abnormalcy".

By the time of his 1922 re-election bid, Barkley was the ranking Democrat on the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. In the election, he carried every First District county, including the Republican strongholds of <a href="Caldwell%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Caldwell</a> and <a href="Crittenden%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Crittenden</a> counties. Despite the victory he lacked the political organization needed for higher office. According to Barkley biographer James K. Libbey, the establishment of such an organization, and not necessarily a desire to become governor, may have motivated him to announce his candidacy for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on November 11, 1922. Critics charged that this was his intent, and he did little to deny it.
Opposing Barkley in the primary was Congressman <a href="J.%20Campbell%20Cantrill">J. Campbell Cantrill</a>, who along with Stanley, led the conservative wing of the party, opposing prohibition and <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's suffrage</a>. Beckham, leader of the liberal wing, intended to run, and his surrogates, particularly "<a href="Louisville%20Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier-Journal</a>" editor <a href="Robert%20Worth%20Bingham">Robert Worth Bingham</a>, began a "Business Man for Governor" campaign in late 1922. Beckham had served as governor from 1900 to 1907 and later in the U.S. Senate, but he was out of office (a "Business Man"), in contrast to Cantrill and Barkley. While Bingham's campaign forced Barkley to declare his candidacy earlier than planned, the tactic was not successful outside Louisville; Beckham supporters backed Barkley, more to prevent Cantrill's nomination than because they desired Barkley's. Barkley's leadership team included his own supporters, influential members of the Beckham faction, and erstwhile Cantrill supporters.

Recognizing the need to broaden his appeal beyond western Kentucky, Barkley opened his campaign in the central Kentucky town of <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville</a> on February 19, 1923. He employed the slogan "Christianity, Morality, and Good Government", and he and Cantrill – colleagues in the House – agreed to refrain from personal attacks. Due to Percy Haly's influence on Barkley and Barkley's own admiration for Woodrow Wilson, he denounced the influence of the coal, racing, and railroad <a href="Trust%20%28monopoly%29">trusts</a> in state politics. "Woodrow Wilson drove the crooks and corruptionists out of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="Gifford%20Pinchot">Governor Pinchot</a> is driving them out of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, and if I am elected Governor of Kentucky I promise to drive them out of Frankfort," he declared. In contrast to his usual preference for low taxes, he advocated a tax on coal deposits. In addition to reducing the coal trust's political influence, he believed the increased revenue, which would largely be generated by out-of-state coal buyers, would result in lower property taxes on farmers. Friends in the Anti-Saloon League convinced him that banning <a href="parimutuel%20betting">parimutuel betting</a> would cripple the racing trust. Many Catholics and <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>s – notably those affiliated with the Louisville Churchmen's Federation – favored prohibition and opposed parimutuel betting on religious grounds, and endorsed Barkley's candidacy, but Bingham, typically a Beckham ally, was slow to endorse him. Like Bingham, "<a href="Lexington%20Herald-Leader">Lexington Herald</a>" editor <a href="Desha%20Breckinridge">Desha Breckinridge</a> had helped create the parimutuel betting system, and Barkley's positions were enough to convince him to back Cantrill, despite the fact that Breckinridge generally disliked Cantrill.

Barkley campaigned across the state, earning the nickname "Iron Man" for making up to 16 speeches in a day. His proposals for a statewide highway system and improvements in education were popular, but coal mining and horse racing interests, based mostly in eastern Kentucky, opposed him. Counties east of a line from Louisville to <a href="Middlesboro%2C%20Kentucky">Middlesboro</a> generally supported Cantrill, while those west of the line mostly went for Barkley, who lost the primary by 9,000 votes (out of 241,000 cast), marking his only election loss. He supported Cantrill in the general election, gaining goodwill within the Democratic Party. Cantrill died on September 2, and the Democratic State Committee had to name his replacement. Barkley was not acceptable to many of the members of the committee, and he refused to accept nomination by party leaders instead of the voters. On September 11, the committee nominated Congressman <a href="William%20J.%20Fields">William J. Fields</a>, and Barkley supported him in the general election, which he won over Republican <a href="Charles%20I.%20Dawson">Charles I. Dawson</a>.

Barkley's party loyalty in the governor's race made him a formidable candidate to challenge Stanley, who by 1924 had angered members of both party factions, but Barkley had spent most of his funds in his campaign against Cantrill, and he did not want to risk his reputation as a party unifier by challenging a Democrat. Instead, he decided to rebuild his war chest to unseat Kentucky's incumbent Republican senator, <a href="Richard%20P.%20Ernst">Richard P. Ernst</a>, in 1926. In the meantime, he refrained from using his influence in state races to avoid losing any goodwill with Kentucky voters.

At the <a href="1924%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1924 Democratic National Convention</a>, Barkley again supported William G. McAdoo for president. Urban interests at the convention promoted <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20York">New York Governor</a> <a href="Al%20Smith">Al Smith</a>, and a bitter convention fight ensued. During the course of 103 ballots, chairman <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Walsh">Thomas J. Walsh</a> needed a rest and temporarily yielded his position to Barkley. The convention was the first to be broadcast nationally, and Barkley's service as chair augmented his national recognition and appeal. The two Democratic factions agreed to compromise, nominating <a href="John%20W.%20Davis">John W. Davis</a>, who Libbey called a "competent nonentity"; Davis <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201924">lost in the general election</a> to <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>. Barkley won another term in the House by a 2-to-1 margin over his Republican opponent in 1924, but Democratic divisions cost Stanley his Senate seat, and Barkley became even more convinced of the value of party loyalty.

Because of Barkley's role in crafting the <a href="Railway%20Labor%20Act">Railway Labor Act</a>, the Associated Railway Labor Organizations endorsed him to unseat Ernst even before he formally announced his candidacy on April 26, 1926. Since the 1923 gubernatorial contest, he had distanced himself from Haly and promised the conservatives that he would not push a ban on parimutuel betting if elected. Consequently, he had no opposition in the primary. Congressman (and later <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a>) <a href="Fred%20M.%20Vinson">Fred M. Vinson</a> managed his general election campaign.

Coolidge supported Ernst, and Commerce Secretary <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> campaigned in the state on his behalf. Ernst had opposed a bonus for veterans of World War I, an unpopular position in Kentucky, and at 68 years old, his age worked against him. Barkley contrasted his impoverished upbringing with Ernst's affluent lifestyle as a corporate lawyer, and also attacked him for supporting <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> Senator <a href="Truman%20Handy%20Newberry">Truman Handy Newberry</a>, who resigned due to allegations of election fraud. Republican voters were angered that Ernst did not support Republican Kentucky Congressman <a href="John%20W.%20Langley">John W. Langley</a> when Langley was charged with illegally aiding a large <a href="Rum-running">bootlegging</a> operation in Louisville. Ernst tried to resurrect the issues of Barkley's support for the coal tax and opposition to parimutuel betting, but in the general election, Barkley won by a vote of 287,997 to 266,657.

In the Senate, Barkley was assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20Congress%20Joint%20Committee%20on%20the%20Library">Committee on the Library</a>, and the committees on <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Finance">Finance</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs">Banking and Currency</a>; later, he was added to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Commerce%2C%20Science%20and%20Transportation">Commerce Committee</a>. In early 1928, Vice President <a href="Charles%20G.%20Dawes">Charles G. Dawes</a> assigned him to a special committee to investigate the campaign expenditures of the leading candidates in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201928">upcoming presidential election</a>.
Democrats considered nominating him for vice president that year, calculating that his party loyalty and appeal to rural, agricultural and prohibitionist constituents, could balance a ticket headed by likely presidential nominee Al Smith, an urban anti-prohibitionist. When the Kentucky delegation arrived at the <a href="1928%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1928 Democratic National Convention</a>, they approached Smith supporters with a view to pairing Barkley to their candidate. They were received cordially, but Smith's advisors thought placing candidates with such differing views on the ticket would seem contrived to the electorate. They did not tell Barkley of their decision until after he seconded Smith's nomination for president. Smith then announced <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> Senator <a href="Joseph%20T.%20Robinson">Joseph T. Robinson</a> as his preferred running mate. The Kentuckians nominated Barkley in spite of Smith's preference, but the overwhelming majority of delegates voted for Robinson, and Barkley announced that Kentucky was changing its support in order to make the nomination unanimous.

Barkley and his wife Dorothy took a vacation after the convention, returning to Kentucky in August 1928 to find that, in his absence, Barkley had been chosen state chairman of Smith's campaign. He campaigned for Smith, but Herbert Hoover won a landslide victory. After the election, Barkley led a coalition of liberal Democrats and Republicans that opposed Hoover's use of protective tariffs, a debate that took particular urgency following the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>. Barkley opposed the <a href="Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley%20Tariff%20Act">Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act</a>, claiming it would cost Americans both jobs and exports, but Congress approved it, and Hoover signed it on June 17, 1930. When Congress adjourned, Barkley accompanied <a href="Sherwood%20Eddy">Sherwood Eddy</a> and fellow senators <a href="Burton%20K.%20Wheeler">Burton K. Wheeler</a> and <a href="Bronson%20M.%20Cutting">Bronson M. Cutting</a> to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in August 1930. He was impressed by the industrial development brought about by <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s <a href="first%20five-year%20plan">first five-year plan</a> but did not advocate closer diplomatic ties with the Communist nation, as some of his colleagues did.

Barkley maintained that Hoover's response to the <a href="Great%20Depression">continuing depression</a> and the <a href="Dust%20Bowl">severe drought in 1930</a> were inadequate and pointed out that the $45 million in loans to farmers that he approved amounted to less than half the losses sustained by Kentucky's farmers alone. He was angered that Hoover refused to call a special legislative session to adopt relief measures after the regular congressional adjourned in early March 1931. He planned a series of speeches condemning Hoover beginning in June but was injured in an automobile accident on June 22, limiting his political activities for the remainder of the year.

Barkley supported Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1932, but facing a re-election bid himself, he did not announce his support, fearing that his message might not resonate with Kentucky voters. Roosevelt supporters offered Barkley the <a href="keynote%20address">keynote address</a> and temporary chairmanship of the <a href="1932%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1932 Democratic National Convention</a> if he would endorse their candidate. Both opportunities would help Barkley's re-election chances, so he announced his support for Roosevelt on March 22, 1932. In his keynote, Barkley warmly recalled the Wilson administration and denounced more than a decade of Republican dominance. Applause frequently punctuated the speech, with the longest interruption – a 45-minute near-riot – erupting after Barkley called for a platform plank directing Congress to repeal <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition</a>. According to Libbey, the remark was not a repudiation of his prohibitionist position but a desire for the people to express their will on repeal. Prohibitionist constituents still supported Barkley because, for most of them, the depression trumped all other concerns.

<a href="George%20B.%20Martin">George B. Martin</a>, who had served six months in the Senate in 1918 after being appointed to fill a vacancy, opposed Barkley in the 1932 primary, but Barkley defeated him by a two-to-one margin. In the general election, he defeated Republican Congressman <a href="Maurice%20H.%20Thatcher">Maurice H. Thatcher</a> by a vote of 575,077 to 393,865, marking the first time in the 20th century that a Kentucky senator won a second consecutive term. Democrats gained control of the Senate during <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201932">the 1932 elections</a>; Joseph Robinson was chosen <a href="floor%20leader">majority leader</a>, and he appointed Barkley as his assistant. Together, they secured passage of <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> legislation, including the <a href="Agricultural%20Adjustment%20Act">Agricultural Adjustment Act</a>, the <a href="National%20Industrial%20Recovery%20Act">National Industrial Recovery Act</a>, and the <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Relief%20Act">Federal Emergency Relief Act</a>. In July 1934, the Democratic National Committee chose Barkley to respond to <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a> chairman <a href="Henry%20P.%20Fletcher">Henry P. Fletcher</a>'s radio attacks on the New Deal. Later that year, he embarked on a tour of twenty states, defending the New Deal and stumping for Democratic candidates in the <a href="United%20States%20elections%2C%201934">1934 midterm elections</a>.

Barkley was again the keynote speaker at the <a href="1936%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1936 Democratic National Convention</a>. During his address, he alluded to the Supreme Court's decision in "<a href="Schechter%20Poultry%20Corp.%20v.%20United%20States">Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States</a>" – which struck down the National Industrial Recovery Act as unconstitutional – asking "Is the court beyond criticism? May it be regarded as too sacred to be disagreed with?" These remarks help set an anti-Supreme Court tone for Roosevelt's second term. On February 5, 1937, Roosevelt proposed <a href="Judicial%20Procedures%20Reform%20Bill%20of%201937">legislation</a> authorizing the president to appoint an additional justice for each one over the age of 70. Many saw this proposal as an attempt to avoid further nullification of New Deal provisions as unconstitutional by appointing more sympathetic justices, and they dubbed the measure Roosevelt's "court-packing plan".

Barkley and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> Senator <a href="Pat%20Harrison">Pat Harrison</a> were the leading candidates to succeed Robinson as Democratic floor leader when he died on July 14, 1937. Harrison's tenure in the Senate was eight years longer than Barkley's, and he was supported by conservative Southern Democratic senators opposed to Roosevelt's court-packing plan. Harrison had helped secure Roosevelt's nomination at the 1932 Democratic National Convention by convincing <a href="Governor%20of%20Mississippi">Mississippi Governor</a> <a href="Martin%20Sennet%20Conner">Martin Sennet Conner</a> to keep his state's delegation loyal to Roosevelt, but Roosevelt preferred Barkley because of his support of the New Deal. A letter from Roosevelt praising Barkley's legislative accomplishments and addressed to "My Dear Alben" was seen as an endorsement. Although Roosevelt remained publicly neutral, he pressured <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>' <a href="William%20H.%20Dieterich">William H. Dieterich</a> and <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>'s <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> to support Barkley instead of Harrison; Dieterich acquiesced, but Truman remained loyal to Harrison. Many senators resented Roosevelt's interference in a traditionally legislative prerogative. Ultimately, Barkley was elected by a single vote.

Barkley faced a primary challenge in his <a href="United%20States%20elections%2C%201940">1938 re-election bid</a> from <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a>, Kentucky's popular governor who had a strong political organization throughout the state. According to historian <a href="James%20C.%20Klotter">James C. Klotter</a>, Chandler was confident of his ascension to the presidency and saw the Senate as a stepping stone. Chandler twice asked Roosevelt to appoint Kentucky's junior Senator, <a href="M.%20M.%20Logan">M. M. Logan</a>, to a federal judgeship so he could arrange his own appointment to Logan's Senate seat. On one of these occasions – the retirement of Supreme Court Justice <a href="George%20Sutherland">George Sutherland</a> – Barkley advised Roosevelt to appoint <a href="United%20States%20Solicitor%20General">Solicitor General</a> <a href="Stanley%20Forman%20Reed">Stanley Reed</a> instead. Chandler's mentor, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> Senator <a href="Harry%20F.%20Byrd">Harry F. Byrd</a>, and the bloc of Democrats who opposed Roosevelt's New Deal, then encouraged Chandler to announce his candidacy for Barkley's seat.

"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" saw the primary as "the Gettysburg of the party's internecine strife" over control of the <a href="Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a> in 1940. Early on, Chandler portrayed himself as a supporter of Roosevelt – since Roosevelt was popular in Kentucky – but opposed to the New Deal. He pointed to his fiscal conservatism as governor, including reorganizing and downsizing the executive branch and reducing the state's debt. Polls showing Barkley with a comfortable lead and an overwhelming victory by New Deal supporter <a href="Claude%20Pepper">Claude Pepper</a> in Florida's May Senate primary convinced Chandler to shift his focus from the New Deal. He criticized Barkley as "a stranger to the state" and obliquely referred to "fat, sleek senators who go to Europe and have forgotten the people of Kentucky except when they run for election". Forty years old – 20 years Barkley's junior – he referred to Barkley as "Old Alben".

Early in the contest, congressional business restricted Barkley's campaign to weekends, so he enlisted allies like Fred Vinson to speak on his behalf. Chandler's political enemies such as former governor <a href="Ruby%20Laffoon">Ruby Laffoon</a>, whom Chandler had crossed as lieutenant governor, and <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Sr.">John Y. Brown, Sr.</a>, who felt that Chandler had broken a promise to support him for a seat in the Senate, also supported Barkley. Although labor leaders had backed Chandler's gubernatorial bid, they endorsed Barkley because of Roosevelt's support for labor unions. After the congressional session, Barkley resumed his "Iron Man" campaign style, making between 8 and 15 speeches each day and traveling, on average, per week. This countered Chandler's implication that Barkley's age was a disadvantage, a charge that was further blunted when the younger Chandler fell ill in July, temporarily halting his campaigning. Chandler indirectly charged that a Barkley supporter had poisoned his ice water, causing the illness. Barkley ridiculed the suggestion, promising to appoint "an ice water guard" for his campaign. During speeches, he would lift a glass of water to his lips, then mockingly inspect it and refuse to drink it. Louisville police dismissed Chandler's claim as "a political bedtime story".

Recognizing that the defeat of his hand-picked floor leader would be a repudiation of his agenda, Roosevelt began a tour of the state in <a href="Covington%2C%20Kentucky">Covington</a> on July 8, 1938. Chandler, the state's chief executive, was invited to welcome the president. Although clearly campaigning for Barkley, Roosevelt made courteous remarks about Chandler in the spirit of party unity, but in <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green</a>, he chastised Chandler for "dragging federal judgeships into a political campaign".

As nearly every 20th century Kentucky governor had done, Chandler printed campaign materials with state funds, solicited campaign funds from state employees, and promised new government jobs in exchange for votes. A later investigation determined that Chandler had raised at least $10,000 from state employees. Federal New Deal employees countered by working on Barkley's behalf. Barkley and George H. Goodman, director of the <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a> (WPA) in Kentucky, denied that WPA employees played a role in the campaign, but journalist <a href="Thomas%20Lunsford%20Stokes">Thomas Lunsford Stokes</a> concluded that "the WPA ... was deep in politics" in Kentucky, winning the <a href="1939%20Pulitzer%20Prize">1939 Pulitzer Prize</a> for Reporting for his investigation. A Senate committee investigated Stokes' findings, and WPA administrator <a href="Harry%20Hopkins">Harry Hopkins</a> claimed the committee's report refuted all but two of Stokes' twenty-two charges. Nevertheless, Congress passed the <a href="Hatch%20Act%20of%201939">Hatch Act of 1939</a> which restricted federal employees' participation in political activities.

Barkley won the August 6 election by a vote of 294,391 to 223,149, carrying 74 of <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Kentucky">Kentucky's 120 counties</a>, with large majorities in western Kentucky, the city of Louisville, and rural areas. It was the first loss of Chandler's political career, and the worst suffered by a primary candidate in Kentucky's history to that time. Barkley defeated his Republican opponent, Louisville Judge John P. Haswell, securing 62% of the general election vote. Encouraged by Barkley's success, Roosevelt campaigned against conservative Democratic incumbents in southern states, but all of these candidates won, which damaged Roosevelt's image.

With his caucus divided between conservatives and liberals, Barkley failed to secure passage for Roosevelt's court-packing plan. After the successive failures of several administration-backed domestic bills, the press dubbed the Senate Majority Leader "bumbling Barkley". He was able to salvage an appropriations bill to cover overspending by the WPA, although it allocated much less funding than Roosevelt had wanted. He helped secure the Hatch Act and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Daily%20News">The Washington Daily News</a>" called a 1940 amendment that prohibited campaigning by federally funded state employees a "monument to Alben Barkley's persistence and parliamentary skill". Despite this mixed record, Roosevelt believed some Democratic partisans hoped to nominate Barkley for president at the <a href="1940%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1940 Democratic National Convention</a>, but the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">German invasion of Poland</a> on September 1, 1939, deepened his resolve to seek a third term.
Barkley disagreed with Roosevelt's selection of Agriculture Secretary <a href="Henry%20A.%20Wallace">Henry A. Wallace</a> as his running mate; Libbey felt that "there is enough evidence from Barkley's tortuous private and public statements about the qualifications of Wallace to infer that Barkley wanted the vice presidency for himself", although he did not promote this idea to Roosevelt. Barkley was chosen permanent chairman of the convention; chants of "We want Roosevelt" interrupted his July 16 speech for 20 minutes, indicating that he had created a popular mandate for Roosevelt's renomination, which occurred the next day. Roosevelt went on to <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201940">win an unprecedented third term in a landslide</a>.

Supporting Roosevelt's provision of aid to <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied Powers</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Barkley sponsored the <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease Act</a> in the Senate. In November 1943, he helped draft the <a href="Connally%E2%80%93Fulbright%20Resolution">Connally–Fulbright Resolution</a> for the creation of an international peace-keeping body at the end of the war, an idea he had favored since Woodrow Wilson's support of the League of Nations. Supreme Court Justice and fellow Kentuckian <a href="Louis%20Brandeis">Louis Brandeis</a> influenced Barkley to adopt <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a>; during and after the war, Barkley advocated creation of a <a href="Homeland%20for%20the%20Jewish%20people">Jewish homeland</a> in <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a> and introduced a 1943 resolution demanding that the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazis</a> to be punished for persecuting Jews. U.S. entry into the war diverted Roosevelt's attention away from domestic affairs. Vice President Wallace, <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House Speaker</a> <a href="Sam%20Rayburn">Sam Rayburn</a>, Democratic House Floor Leader <a href="John%20William%20McCormack">John William McCormack</a>, and Barkley – the president's "Big Four" – helped develop and pass the administration's legislative agenda. Barkley regularly met with the chairmen of the Senate's standing committees, forming a sort of legislative cabinet. With their support, he secured passage of the <a href="War%20Powers%20Act%20of%201941">War Powers Act</a> and the <a href="Emergency%20Price%20Control%20Act">Emergency Price Control Act</a>. He also advocated passage of a measure to outlaw <a href="Poll%20tax%20%28United%20States%29">poll tax</a>es, but the bill was defeated.

In April 1943 a confidential analysis by <a href="Isaiah%20Berlin">Isaiah Berlin</a> of the <a href="Senate%20Foreign%20Relations%20Committee">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a> for the British <a href="Foreign%20Office">Foreign Office</a> described Barkley as "a Democratic party 'wheelhorse' who will pull the Administration wagon through thick and thin. Although he is the Majority Leader in the Senate, he is not an adroit negotiator, but a loyal supporter of the President come hell or high water."

Tension developed between Roosevelt and Barkley during the war, however. In 1943, Roosevelt refused to appoint Barkley to a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and Barkley criticized the <a href="War%20Production%20Board">War Production Board</a> for awarding contracts for the production of war-related materials to large companies rather than small businesses. Their most notable clash occurred in February 1944 when Roosevelt requested that Congress approve tax increases to generate over $10 billion in revenue for the war. Barkley and the Senate Finance Committee negotiated a bill containing only $2.3 billion in tax increases. Feeling the measure was insufficient, Roosevelt convened the "Big Four" on February 21 and told them he would veto it. They urged him not to do so, assuring him that the bill they had drafted was the best one that they could pass. Roosevelt vetoed the bill the next day, marking the first time a U.S. president vetoed a revenue bill.

When Barkley entered the Senate chamber on February 23, word had spread that Roosevelt's veto had angered him. He announced that he would resign as floor leader and encouraged his legislative colleagues to override the veto. He stated that Roosevelt's characterization of the bill as "providing relief not for the needy, but for the greedy" was "a calculated and deliberate assault upon the legislative integrity of every member of the Congress of the United States". Roosevelt sent a letter to Barkley insisting he had not intended to impugn Congress' integrity and urging him not to resign. The next morning, Barkley resigned and left the Democratic Conference Room; minutes later, the caucus unanimously re-elected him. Many members who had seen Barkley as Roosevelt's advocate in Congress now looked upon him as Congress' advocate with Roosevelt. Subsequently, Congress overwhelmingly overrode the veto.

Barkley was among 12 nominated at the <a href="1944%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1944 Democratic National Convention</a> to serve as Roosevelt's running mate in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201944">presidential election that year</a>, receiving six votes. Delegates favored dropping vice president Henry Wallace from their ticket in favor of Barkley, but Roosevelt refused to consider him, telling a July 11 meeting of Democratic leaders that he was too old. Instead, he took the recommendation of <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> chairman <a href="Robert%20E.%20Hannegan">Robert E. Hannegan</a> and choose Harry S. Truman. Despite his differences with Roosevelt, Barkley faced no serious challengers in the 1944 Democratic primary and defeated his Republican challenger, <a href="Fayette%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fayette County</a> Commonwealth's Attorney James Park, by a vote of 464,053 to 380,425.

Truman ascended to the presidency when Roosevelt died in April 1945, just before the end of World War II. In the war's aftermath, Americans wanted to know why the U.S. seemed ill-prepared for the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. Barkley sponsored a resolution to create the <a href="Joint%20Committee%20on%20the%20Investigation%20of%20the%20Pearl%20Harbor%20Attack">Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack</a> and was chosen as chairman of the ten-person committee. The committee's report, delivered on July 20, 1946, exonerated Roosevelt of any blame for the attack and highlighted weaknesses in communications between branches of the U.S. armed forces, leading to the creation of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">United States Department of Defense</a>. Barkley also helped ensure U.S. participation in the United Nations and advocated approval of billions of dollars in loans to rebuild Europe. "<a href="Look%20%28American%20magazine%29">Look</a>" magazine named him the second most fascinating person in the country behind <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>.

In the <a href="United%20States%20elections%2C%201946">1946 elections</a>, Republicans wrested control of both houses of Congress from the Democrats for the first time since the Great Depression and gained control of the majority of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and the Democrats, and when a 1946 railroad worker <a href="Strike%20action">strike</a> exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican majorities – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the <a href="Taft%E2%80%93Hartley%20Act">Taft–Hartley Act</a>. They also passed the <a href="Twenty-second%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Twenty-second Amendment</a>, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.
Barkley's wife became an invalid due to heart disease. Barkley had closed his law practice when he was elected to the Senate, so to pay for his wife's care, he supplemented his $10,000 annual salary with speaking engagements. He was the Democratic Speakers Bureau's most requested orator, surpassing Truman. A "<a href="Pageant%20%28magazine%29">Pageant</a>" magazine poll of legislators chose Barkley and Republican <a href="Robert%20A.%20Taft">Robert A. Taft</a> as the hardest-working members of their respective parties. The Barkleys sold their Washington, D.C., home and moved into an apartment to reduce expenses. Marny Clifford, wife of Truman's Naval Advisor <a href="Clark%20Clifford">Clark Clifford</a>, nicknamed Barkley "Sparkle Barkle" for his care of his wife, who died March 10, 1947. When Barkley won the Collier Award in May 1948, he donated the $10,000 prize to the <a href="University%20of%20Louisville%20School%20of%20Medicine">University of Louisville School of Medicine</a> in his wife's honor.

<a href="Civil%20rights">Civil rights</a> bills, unpopular with Southern Democrats, were central to Truman's <a href="Fair%20Deal">Fair Deal</a>. Because Barkley could still appeal to Southern Democrats, Truman asked him to be the keynote speaker at the <a href="1948%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1948 Democratic National Convention</a> for an unprecedented third time. Because of the Republican resurgence and Truman's difficulty appealing to some Democrats, Republican presidential nominee <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Dewey">Thomas E. Dewey</a> was expected to win the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201948">upcoming presidential election</a>. Democrats were energized by Barkley's keynote address, which promoted New Deal accomplishments and called the Republican-controlled <a href="Eightieth%20Congress">Eightieth Congress</a> a "do nothing" Congress. He mentioned Truman only once, leading Truman to suspect that Barkley sought to supplant him as the party's presidential nominee, but no such attempt occurred. Despite these suspicions and his contention that a ticket consisting of a Missourian and a Kentuckian lacked regional geographic balance, convention delegates persuaded Truman to take Barkley as his running mate. Truman had wanted Supreme Court Justice <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a>, but Douglas declined.

Barkley was disappointed that he was not Truman's first choice as running mate, but over the next six weeks, he crisscrossed the country by plane, making over 250 campaign speeches in 36 states. Playing off Barkley's keynote speech, Truman called a special congressional session on July 26, 1948, challenging Republicans to enact their agenda. They were unable to pass any significant legislation, seeming to confirm Barkley's characterization of them as a "do-nothing Congress".

In an upset victory, Truman and Barkley were elected over the Republican ticket by over 2 million votes, and Democrats regained majorities in both houses of Congress. Seventy-one years old at the time of his inauguration, he was the oldest man ever elected Vice President, breaking <a href="Charles%20Curtis">Charles Curtis</a>' record at 69. His grandson, <a href="Stephen%20M.%20Truitt">Stephen M. Truitt</a>, suggested the nickname "Veep" as an alternative to "Mr. Vice President". The nickname was used by the press, but Barkley's successor, <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, discontinued using it, saying it belonged to Barkley.
Despite their personal differences, Truman and Barkley agreed on most issues. Because of Barkley's legislative experience, Truman insisted his vice-president attend cabinet meetings. Barkley chaired the <a href="Senate%20Democratic%20Policy%20Committee">Senate Democratic Policy Committee</a> and attended Truman's weekly legislative conferences. When Congress created the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Security%20Council">National Security Council</a>, it included the vice president as a member. Barkley acted as the administration's primary spokesperson, making 40 major speeches in his first eight months in office. Truman commissioned the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Institute%20of%20Heraldry">United States Army Institute of Heraldry</a> to create a <a href="Seal%20of%20the%20Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">seal</a> and <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">flag</a> for the vice president, advocated raising his salary, and increased his expense budget. Mark O. Hatfield's biographical sketch of Barkley noted that he was "the last [vice president] to preside regularly over the Senate, the last not to have an office in or near the White House, [and] the last to identify more with the legislative than the executive branch".

Despite the Democrats' advantage in the Senate, conservative Democrats united with the Republican minority to oppose much of Truman's agenda, most notably, civil rights legislation. In March 1949, Democratic floor leader <a href="Scott%20W.%20Lucas">Scott W. Lucas</a> introduced an amendment to <a href="Standing%20Rules%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate%2C%20Rule%20XXII">Senate Rule XXII</a> to make <a href="cloture">cloture</a> easier to achieve; hoping to end a ten-day filibuster against a civil rights bill. Conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats opposed the rule change and tried to obstruct it. Lucas asked for a cloture vote on the rule change, but opponents contended that the motion was out of order. Barkley studied the original debate on Rule XXII, which governed both cloture motions, before ruling in Lucas' favor. <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> Senator <a href="Richard%20Russell%2C%20Jr.">Richard Russell, Jr.</a> <a href="Appeal%20%28motion%29">appealed Barkley's decision</a>, and the chamber voted 46–41 to overrule. Sixteen Republicans, mostly from Northeast and West Coast states, voted to sustain the ruling; most Southern Democrats voted with the remaining Republicans to overrule it.

On July 8, 1949, Barkley met <a href="Jane%20Hadley%20Barkley">Jane (Rucker) Hadley</a>, a <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a> widow approximately half his age, at a party thrown by Clark Clifford. After Hadley's return to St. Louis, Barkley kept contact with her via letters and plane trips. Their courtship received national attention, and on November 18, 1949, they married in the Singleton Memorial Chapel of St. John's Methodist Church in St. Louis. Barkley is the only U.S. vice president to marry while in office.

Barkley's most notable tie-breaking vote as vice president was cast on October 4, 1949, to save the <a href="Young%E2%80%93Russell%20Amendment">Young–Russell Amendment</a> which set a 90% parity on the price of cotton, wheat, corn, rice, and peanuts. His friends, Scott Lucas and <a href="Clinton%20Presba%20Anderson">Clint Anderson</a>, opposed the amendment, but Barkley had promised support during the 1948 campaign.

In 1949, Emory University chose Barkley to deliver its commencement address and awarded him an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary</a> <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">Doctor of Laws</a>. The following year, the university's debating society renamed itself the <a href="Barkley%20Forum">Barkley Forum</a>. The university also created the Alben W. Barkley Distinguished Chair in its Department of Political Science.
Barkley tried to mentor Scott Lucas and <a href="Ernest%20McFarland">Ernest McFarland</a>, his immediate successors as floor leader, by teaching them to work with the vice president as he had during Truman's vice presidency, but Truman's unpopularity made cooperation between the executive branch and the legislature difficult. After the U.S. entered the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, Truman focused on foreign affairs, leaving Barkley to campaign for Democratic candidates in the <a href="United%20States%20elections%2C%201950">1950 midterm elections</a>. He traveled over and spoke in almost half of the states during the campaign. He felt ill when he arrived in Paducah on election day, and a doctor diagnosed him with a "tired heart". Returning to Washington, D.C., he spent several days in Naval Hospital, but was able to preside when the Senate opened its session on November 28, 1950. Democrats lost seats in both houses but maintained majorities in each.

On March 1, 1951 – exactly 38 years from his first day in Congress – Barkley's fellow congressmen presented him with the <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a> in honor of his legislative service. Truman surprised Barkley, appearing on the Senate floor to present the medallion and a gavel made of timbers used to renovate the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> after the <a href="burning%20of%20Washington">burning of Washington</a> in 1814.

In November 1951, Barkley and his wife ate <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving</a> dinner with U.S. troops at <a href="Gimpo%20International%20Airport">Kimpo Air Base</a> in <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a>. On his seventy-fourth birthday, Barkley traveled to the front lines on a fact-finding mission for the president. On June 4, 1952, he cast another notable tie-breaking vote to save the <a href="Wage%20Stabilization%20Board">Wage Stabilization Board</a>.

At the March 29, 1952, <a href="Jefferson%E2%80%93Jackson%20Day">Jefferson–Jackson Day</a> fundraiser, Truman announced that he would not seek re-election, although he was exempt from the Twenty-second Amendment's <a href="Term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">term limits</a>. After the announcement, the District of Columbia Democratic Club formed a Barkley for President Club with <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> Senator <a href="Guy%20Gillette">Guy Gillette</a> as chairman. Prominent Kentuckians – including Senator <a href="Earle%20C.%20Clements">Earle C. Clements</a>, Governor <a href="Lawrence%20Wetherby">Lawrence Wetherby</a>, and Lieutenant Governor <a href="Emerson%20Beauchamp">Emerson "Doc" Beauchamp</a> – supported the candidacy. Exactly two months after Truman's announcement, Barkley declared his availability to run for president while maintaining he was not actively seeking the office.
Barkley's distant cousin, <a href="Governor%20of%20Illinois">Illinois Governor</a> <a href="Adlai%20Stevenson%20II">Adlai Stevenson II</a> (grandson of former vice president <a href="Adlai%20Stevenson%20I">Adlai Stevenson I</a>), was considered his primary competition for the nomination, but had not committed before the convention. Richard Russell, Jr. and <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> Senator <a href="Estes%20Kefauver">Estes Kefauver</a> were also interested in the nomination. Kentucky's delegation to the <a href="1952%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1952 Democratic National Convention</a> announced that they would support Barkley, and Truman encouraged Missouri's delegates to do so. Democratic National Committee chairman <a href="Frank%20E.%20McKinney">Frank E. McKinney</a>, former chairman <a href="James%20Farley">James Farley</a>, and <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">Senate Secretary</a> Leslie Biffle also supported him. Two weeks before the convention, Stevenson advisor <a href="Jacob%20Arvey">Jacob Arvey</a> told Barkley that Stevenson was not going to be nominated and favored nominating Barkley. Barkley's advisors believed that Kefauver and Russell would knock each other out of the early balloting, allowing Barkley to capture the nomination.

To dispel concerns about his age (74), failing eyesight, and heart problems, Barkley arrived in Chicago for the <a href="1952%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1952 Democratic National Convention</a> and briskly walked seven blocks from the bus station to his campaign headquarters. The attempt was rendered moot on July 20 when a group of labor leaders, including <a href="United%20Automobile%20Workers">United Automobile Workers</a> President <a href="Walter%20Reuther">Walter Reuther</a>, issued a statement calling Barkley too old and requesting that Democrats nominate someone younger like Stevenson. At a meeting with labor leaders the next morning, Barkley failed to persuade them to retract the statement, which caused delegations from large industrial states like Illinois, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, and Pennsylvania to waver on their commitments to Barkley. On July 21, he announced his withdrawal from the race. Invited to make a farewell address on July 22, he received a 35-minute ovation when he took the podium and 45-minute one at the speech's end. In a show of respect, a Missouri delegate nominated Barkley for president and House Majority Leader McCormack seconded it, but Stevenson was easily nominated. A month after the convention, Barkley hosted a Stevenson picnic and campaign rally at his home in Paducah and later introduced him at a rally in Louisville. Despite Barkley's predictions of a Democratic victory, Stevenson <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201952">lost in overwhelming fashion</a> to Republican Dwight Eisenhower.

Barkley's term as vice president ended on January 20, 1953. After the election, he had surgery to remove his <a href="cataract">cataract</a>s. He contracted with <a href="NBC">NBC</a> to create 26 fifteen-minute commentary broadcasts called "Meet the Veep". Low ratings prompted NBC's decision not to renew the series in September 1953. In retirement, Barkley remained a popular speaker and began working on his memoirs with journalist Sidney Shallett. He re-entered politics in 1954, challenging incumbent Republican Senator <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper">John Sherman Cooper</a>. In a 1971 study of Barkley's Senate career, historian Glenn Finch argued that Barkley was the only person who could beat Cooper. Few issues differentiated the candidates, and the campaign hinged on party politics; visits to Kentucky by President Eisenhower, Vice President Richard Nixon, and Senator <a href="Everett%20Dirksen">Everett Dirksen</a> on Cooper's behalf reinforced this notion. Barkley resumed his Iron Man campaign style, campaigning for up to sixteen hours a day, countering the "too old" charge that cost him the presidential nomination. He won the general election by a vote of 434,109 to 362,948, giving Democrats a one-vote advantage in the Senate.

Veteran <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> Senator <a href="Harley%20M.%20Kilgore">Harley M. Kilgore</a> offered to exchange seats with Barkley, putting Barkley on the front row with the chamber's senior members and himself on the back row with the freshman legislators, but Barkley declined the offer. In honor of his previous service, he was assigned to the prestigious <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations">Committee on Foreign Relations</a>. In this position, he endorsed Eisenhower's appointment of Cooper as <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20India">U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal</a>. His relative lack of seniority did not afford him much influence.
In an April 30, 1956, keynote address at the <a href="Washington%20and%20Lee%20Mock%20Convention">Washington and Lee Mock Convention</a>, Barkley spoke of his willingness to sit with the other freshman senators in Congress, he ended with an allusion to <a href="Psalm%2084">Psalm 84:10</a>, saying "I'm glad to sit on the back row, for I would rather be a servant in the House of the Lord than to sit in the seats of the mighty." He then collapsed onstage and died of a heart attack. He was buried in Mount Kenton Cemetery near Paducah.

A dam constructed by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> on the <a href="Cumberland%20River">Cumberland River</a> in 1966, and the lake it forms, were named <a href="Barkley%20Dam">Barkley Dam</a> and <a href="Lake%20Barkley">Lake Barkley</a> in Barkley's honor. <a href="Barkley%20Regional%20Airport">Barkley Regional Airport</a> in Paducah is also named for him. In 1984, the federal government declined to purchase The Angles, his Paducah home, and it was sold at auction. Many personal items owned by Barkley are displayed on the second floor of the historic house <a href="Whitehaven%20%28Paducah%2C%20Kentucky%29">Whitehaven</a> in Paducah. In February 2008, Paducah's American Justice School of Law changed owners after failing to secure accreditation from the <a href="American%20Bar%20Association">American Bar Association</a>. It was renamed the <a href="Alben%20W.%20Barkley%20School%20of%20Law">Alben W. Barkley School of Law</a>, but remained unaccredited, and closed in December 2008.

Eta Carinae

Eta Carinae (η Carinae, abbreviated to η Car), formerly known as Eta Argus, is a <a href="star%20system">stellar system</a> containing at least <a href="binary%20system">two stars</a> with a combined <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> greater than five million times that of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, located around 7,500 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s (2,300 <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s) distant in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> <a href="Carina%20%28constellation%29">Carina</a>. Previously a 4th-<a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> star, it brightened in 1837 to become brighter than <a href="Rigel">Rigel</a> marking the start of the Great Eruption. Eta Carinae became the <a href="List%20of%20brightest%20stars">second-brightest star</a> in the sky between 11 and 14 March 1843 before fading well below <a href="naked%20eye">naked eye</a> visibility after 1856. In a smaller eruption, it reached 6th magnitude in 1892 before fading again. It has brightened consistently since about 1940, becoming brighter than magnitude 4.5 by 2014. Eta Carinae is <a href="circumpolar%20star">circumpolar</a> from latitudes south of <a href="30th%20parallel%20south">latitude 30°S</a>, and it is never visible north of about <a href="30th%20parallel%20north">latitude 30°N</a>.

The two main stars of the Eta Carinae system have an <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">eccentric orbit</a> with a <a href="orbital%20period">period</a> of 5.54 years. The primary is a peculiar star similar to a <a href="luminous%20blue%20variable">luminous blue variable</a> (LBV) that was initially of which it has lost at least already, and is expected to explode as a <a href="supernova">supernova</a> in the astronomically near future. This is the only star known to produce <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> <a href="laser">laser</a> emission. The secondary star is hot and also highly luminous, probably of <a href="O-type%20star">spectral class O</a>, around 30–80 times as massive as the Sun. The system is heavily obscured by the <a href="Homunculus%20Nebula">Homunculus Nebula</a>, material ejected from the primary during the Great Eruption. It is a member of the <a href="Trumpler%2016">Trumpler 16</a> <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> within the much larger <a href="Carina%20Nebula">Carina Nebula</a>.

Although unrelated to the star and nebula, the weak <a href="Eta%20Carinids">Eta Carinids</a> <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a> has a <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiant</a> very close to Eta Carinae.

There is no reliable evidence of Eta Carinae being observed or recorded before the 17th century, although Dutch navigator <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Keyser</a> described a fourth-magnitude star at approximately the correct position around 1595–1596, which was copied onto the celestial globes of <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> and <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a> and the 1603 "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" of <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>. <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a>'s independent star catalogue from 1603 does not include Eta Carinae among the other 4th magnitude stars in the region. The earliest firm record was made by <a href="Edmond%20Halley">Edmond Halley</a> in 1677 when he recorded the star simply as "Sequens" (i.e. "following" relative to another star) within a new constellation <a href="Robur%20Carolinum">Robur Carolinum</a>. His "Catalogus Stellarum Australium" was published in 1679. The star was also known by the <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s Eta Roboris Caroli, Eta Argus or Eta Navis. In 1751 <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> gave the stars of <a href="Argo%20Navis">Argo Navis</a> and <a href="Robur%20Carolinum">Robur Carolinum</a> a single set of Greek letter Bayer designations within his constellation Argo, and designated three areas within Argo for the purposes of using Latin letter designations three times over. Eta fell within the keel portion of the ship which was later to become the constellation <a href="Carina%20%28constellation%29">Carina</a>. It was not generally known as Eta Carinae until 1879, when the stars of Argo Navis were finally given the epithets of the daughter constellations in the "Uranometria Argentina" of <a href="Benjamin%20Apthorp%20Gould">Gould</a>.

Eta Carinae is too far south to be part of the <a href="Twenty-Eight%20Mansions">mansion-based</a> <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">traditional Chinese astronomy</a>, but it was mapped when the <a href="Chinese%20constellations%23The%20Southern%20Asterisms%20%28%E8%BF%91%E5%8D%97%E6%A5%B5%E6%98%9F%E5%8D%80%29">Southern Asterisms</a> were created at the start of the 17th century. Together with <a href="HD%2090853">s Carinae</a>, <a href="Lambda%20Centauri">λ Centauri</a>, and <a href="Lambda%20Muscae">λ Muscae</a>, Eta Carinae forms the <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> (<a href="Carina%20%28Chinese%20astronomy%29">Sea and Mountain</a>). Eta Carinae has the names Tseen She (from the Chinese 天社 [Mandarin: "tiānshè"] "Heaven's altar") and Foramen. It is also known as (, ).
Halley gave an approximate <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of "4" at the time of discovery, which has been calculated as magnitude 3.3 on the modern scale. The handful of possible earlier sightings suggest that Eta Carinae was not significantly brighter than this for much of the 17th century. Further sporadic observations over the next 70 years show that Eta Carinae was probably around 3rd magnitude or fainter, until Lacaille reliably recorded it at 2nd magnitude in 1751. It is unclear whether Eta Carinae varied significantly in brightness over the next 50 years; there are occasional observations such as <a href="William%20Burchell">William Burchell</a>'s at 4th magnitude in 1815, but it is uncertain whether these are just re-recordings of earlier observations.

In 1827 Burchell specifically noted Eta Carinae's unusual brightness at 1st magnitude, and was the first to suspect that it varied in brightness. <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a>, who was in South Africa at the time, made a detailed series of accurate measurements in the 1830s showing that Eta Carinae consistently shone around magnitude 1.4 until November 1837. On the evening of December 16, 1837, Herschel was astonished to see that it had brightened to slightly outshine <a href="Rigel">Rigel</a>. This event marked the beginning of a roughly 18-year period known as the Great Eruption.

Eta Carinae was brighter still on January 2, 1838, equivalent to <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a>, before fading slightly over the following three months. Herschel did not observe the star after this, but received correspondence from the Reverend W.S. Mackay in Calcutta, who wrote in 1843, "To my great surprise I observed this March last (1843), that the star Eta Argus had become a star of the first magnitude fully as bright as <a href="Canopus">Canopus</a>, and in colour and size very like <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a>." Observations at the Cape of Good Hope indicated it peaked in brightness, surpassing Canopus, over March 11 to 14, 1843 before beginning to fade, then brightened to between the brightness of Alpha Centauri and Canopus between March 24 and 28 before fading once again. For much of 1844 the brightness was midway between Alpha Centauri and <a href="Beta%20Centauri">Beta Centauri</a>, around magnitude +0.2, before brightening again at the end of the year. At its brightest in 1843 it likely reached an apparent magnitude of −0.8, then −1.0 in 1845. The peaks in 1827, 1838, and 1843 are likely to have occurred at the <a href="periastron">periastron</a> passage—the point the two stars are closest together—of the <a href="Binary%20star">binary</a> orbit. From 1845 to 1856, the brightness decreased by around 0.1 magnitudes per year, but with possible rapid and large fluctuations.

In their oral traditions, the Boorong clan of the <a href="Wergaia">Wergaia</a> people of <a href="Lake%20Tyrrell">Lake Tyrrell</a>, north-western Victoria, Australia told of a reddish star they knew as "Collowgulloric War", the wife of "War" (<a href="Canopus">Canopus</a>, the Crow — ). In 2010, astronomers Duane Hamacher and David Frew from <a href="Macquarie%20University">Macquarie University</a> in Sydney showed that this was Eta Carinae during its Great Eruption in the 1840s. From 1857 the brightness decreased rapidly until it faded below <a href="naked%20eye">naked eye</a> visibility by 1886. This has been calculated to be due to the condensation of <a href="cosmic%20dust">dust</a> in the ejected material surrounding the star rather than an intrinsic change in luminosity.

A new brightening started in 1887, peaked at about magnitude 6.2 in 1892, then at the end of March 1895 faded rapidly to about magnitude 7.5. Although there are only visual records of the 1890 eruption, it has been calculated that Eta Carinae was suffering 4.3 magnitudes of visual extinction due to the gas and dust ejected in the Great Eruption. An unobscured brightness would have been magnitude 1.5–1.9, significantly brighter than the historical magnitude. This appeared to be a smaller copy of the Great Eruption, expelling much less material.

Between 1900 and at least 1940, Eta Carinae appeared to have settled at a constant brightness at around magnitude 7.6, but in 1953 it was noted to have brightened again to magnitude 6.5. The brightening continued steadily, but with fairly regular variations of a few tenths of a magnitude.

In 1996 the variations were first identified as having a 5.52-year period, later measured more accurately at 5.54 years, leading to the idea of a binary system. The binary theory was confirmed by observations of radio, optical, and <a href="near%20infrared">near infrared</a> radial velocity and line profile changes, referred to collectively as a "spectroscopic event", at the predicted time of periastron passage in late 1997 and early 1998. At the same time there was a complete collapse of the X-ray emission presumed to originate in a <a href="colliding-wind%20binary">colliding wind zone</a>. The confirmation of a luminous binary companion greatly modified the understanding of the physical properties of the Eta Carinae system and its variability.

A sudden doubling of brightness was observed in 1998–99 bringing it back to naked eye visibility. During the 2014 spectroscopic event, the apparent visual magnitude became brighter than magnitude 4.5. The brightness does not always vary consistently at different wavelengths, and does not always exactly follow the 5.5 year cycle. Radio, infrared, and space-based observations have expanded coverage of Eta Carinae across all wavelengths and revealed ongoing changes in the <a href="spectral%20energy%20distribution">spectral energy distribution</a>.

In July 2018, Eta Carinae was reported to have the strongest colliding wind shock in the solar neighbourhood. Observations with the <a href="NuSTAR">NuSTAR</a> satellite gave much higher resolution data than the earlier <a href="Fermi%20Gamma-ray%20Space%20Telescope">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a>. Using direct focussing observations of the non-thermal source in the extremely hard X-ray band that is spatially coincident with the star, they showed that the source of non-thermal X-rays varies with the orbital phase of the binary star system and that the photon index of the emission is similar to that derived through analysis of the γ-ray (gamma) spectrum.

As a 4th-magnitude star, Eta Carinae is comfortably visible to the naked eye in all but the most <a href="light%20pollution">light-polluted</a> skies in inner city areas according to the <a href="Bortle%20scale">Bortle scale</a>. Its brightness has varied over a wide range, from the second-brightest star in the sky at one point in the 19th century to well below naked eye visibility. Its location at around 60°S in the far <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> means it cannot be seen by observers in Europe and much of North America.

Located between Canopus and the Southern Cross, Eta Carinae is easily pinpointed as the brightest star within the large naked eye Carina Nebula. In a telescope the "star" is framed within the dark "V" <a href="dust%20lane">dust lane</a> of the nebula and appears distinctly orange and clearly non-stellar. High magnification will show the two orange lobes of a surrounding <a href="reflection%20nebula">reflection nebula</a> known as the <a href="Homunculus%20Nebula">Homunculus Nebula</a> on either side of a bright central core. Variable star observers can compare its brightness with several 4th- and 5th-magnitude stars closely surrounding the nebula.

Discovered in 1961, the weak <a href="Eta%20Carinids">Eta Carinids</a> <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a> has a <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiant</a> very close to Eta Carinae. Occurring from 14 to 28 January, the shower peaks around 21 January. Meteor showers are not associated with bodies outside the Solar System, making the proximity to Eta Carinae merely a coincidence.

The <a href="Equivalent%20width">strength</a> and <a href="spectral%20line%20shape">profile</a> of the <a href="spectral%20line">lines</a> in the Eta Carinae <a href="stellar%20spectrum">spectrum</a> are highly variable, but there are a number of consistent distinctive features. The spectrum is dominated by <a href="emission%20line">emission line</a>s, usually broad although the higher excitation lines are overlaid by a narrow central component from dense <a href="ionisation">ionised</a> nebulosity, especially the <a href="Weigelt%20Blobs">Weigelt Blobs</a>. Most lines show a <a href="P%20Cygni%23P%20Cygni%20Profile">P Cygni profile</a> but with the absorption wing much weaker than the emission. The broad P Cygni lines are typical of strong <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a>s, with very weak <a href="absorption%20spectrum">absorption</a> in this case because the central star is so heavily obscured. <a href="Thomson%20scattering">Electron scattering wings</a> are present but relatively weak, indicating a clumpy wind. <a href="Hydrogen%20spectral%20series">Hydrogen lines</a> are present and strong, showing that Eta Carinae still retains much of its <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> envelope. <a href="Ion%20notation">He</a> lines are much weaker than the hydrogen lines, and the absence of He lines provides an upper limit to the possible temperature of the primary star. N lines can be identified but are not strong, while carbon lines cannot be detected and oxygen lines are at best very weak, indicating <a href="Stellar%20evolution%23Hydrogen%20fusion">core hydrogen burning</a> via the <a href="CNO%20cycle">CNO cycle</a> with some mixing to the surface. Perhaps the most striking feature is the rich Fe emission in both <a href="forbidden%20mechanism">permitted and forbidden lines</a>, with the forbidden lines arising from excitation of low density nebulosity around the star.

The earliest analyses of the star's spectrum are descriptions of visual observations from 1869, of prominent emission lines "C, D, b, F, and the principal green nitrogen line". Absorption lines are explicitly described as not being visible. The letters refer to <a href="Fraunhofer%20lines">Fraunhofer's spectral notation</a> and correspond to <a href="H-alpha">H</a>, He ("D" usually refers to the sodium doublet, but "d" or "D" was used for the nearby helium line), Fe, and H. It is assumed that the final line is from Fe very close to the green <a href="nebulium">nebulium</a> line now known to be from O.

Photographic spectra from 1893 were described as similar to an F5 star, but with a few weak emission lines. Analysis to modern spectral standards suggests an early F <a href="Stellar%20classification">spectral type</a>. By 1895 the spectrum again consisted mostly of strong emission lines, with the absorption lines present but largely obscured by emission. This spectral transition from F <a href="supergiant">supergiant</a> to strong emission is characteristic of <a href="nova">nova</a>e, where ejected material initially radiates like a pseudo-<a href="photosphere">photosphere</a> and then the emission spectrum develops as it expands and thins.

The emission line spectrum associated with dense stellar winds has persisted ever since the late 19th century. Individual lines show widely varying <a href="Spectral%20line%23Line%20broadening%20and%20shift">widths, profiles, and Doppler shifts</a>, often multiple velocity components within the same line. The spectral lines also show variation over time, most strongly with a 5.5-year period but also less dramatic changes over shorter and longer periods, as well as ongoing secular development of the entire spectrum. The spectrum of light reflected from the <a href="Homunculus%20Nebula%23Weigelt%20Blobs">Weigelt Blobs</a>, and assumed to originate mainly with the primary, is similar to the <a href="P%20Cygni%23P%20Cygni%20Profile">extreme P Cygni-type</a> star <a href="HDE%20316285">HDE 316285</a> which has a spectral type of B0Ieq.

Direct spectral observations did not begin until after the Great Eruption, but <a href="light%20echo">light echo</a>es from the eruption reflected from other parts of the Carina Nebula were detected using the <a href="National%20Optical%20Astronomy%20Observatory">U.S. National Optical Astronomy Observatory's</a> <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20M.%20Blanco%20Telescope">Blanco 4-meter telescope</a> at the <a href="Cerro%20Tololo%20Inter-American%20Observatory">Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory</a>. Analysis of the reflected spectra indicated the light was emitted when Eta Carinae had the appearance of a 5,000 <a href="Kelvin">K</a> G2-to-G5 supergiant, some 2,000 K cooler than expected from other <a href="supernova%20impostor">supernova impostor</a> events. Further light echo observations show that following the peak brightness of the Great Eruption the spectrum developed prominent P Cygni profiles and <a href="Cyano%20radical">CN</a> molecular bands. These indicate that the star, or the expanding shell of ejected material, had cooled further and may have been colliding with <a href="Circumstellar%20dust">circumstellar material</a> in a similar way to a type IIn <a href="supernova">supernova</a>.

In the second half of the 20th century, much higher resolution visual spectra became available. The spectrum continued to show complex and baffling features, with much of the energy from the central star being recycled into the infrared by surrounding dust, some reflection of light from the star from dense localised objects in the circumstellar material, but with obvious high ionisation features indicative of very high temperatures. The line profiles are complex and variable, indicating a number of absorption and emission features at various <a href="Doppler%20effect">velocities relative</a> to the central star.

The 5.5 year orbital cycle produces strong spectral changes at periastron that are known as spectroscopic events. Certain wavelengths of radiation suffer eclipses, either due to actual <a href="occultation">occultation</a> by one of the stars or due to passage within opaque portions of the complex stellar winds. Despite being ascribed to orbital rotation, these events vary significantly from cycle to cycle. These changes have become stronger since 2003 and it is generally believed that long-term secular changes in the stellar winds or previously ejected material may be the culmination of a return to the state of the star before its Great Eruption.

The <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> spectrum of the Eta Carinae system shows many emission lines of ionised metals such as Fe and Cr, as well as <a href="Lyman%20series">Lyman</a> (Ly) and a continuum from a hot central source. The ionisation levels and continuum require the existence of a source with a temperature at least 37,000 K.

Certain Fe UV lines are unusually strong. These originate in the Weigelt Blobs and are caused by a <a href="gain%20%28laser%29">low-gain</a> <a href="Laser">lasing</a> effect. Ionised hydrogen between a blob and the central star generates intense Ly emission which penetrates the blob. The blob contains <a href="Hydrogen%20atom">atomic hydrogen</a> with a small admixture of other elements, including iron <a href="photo-ionisation">photo-ionised</a> by radiation from the central stars. An accidental <a href="Resonance%23Optical%20resonance">resonance</a> (where emission coincidentally has a suitable energy to <a href="optical%20pumping">pump</a> the excited state) allows the Ly emission to pump the Fe <a href="ion">ion</a>s to certain <a href="metastability">pseudo-metastable states</a>, creating a <a href="population%20inversion">population inversion</a> that allows the <a href="stimulated%20emission">stimulated emission</a> to take place. This effect is similar to the <a href="astrophysical%20maser">maser</a> emission from dense pockets surrounding many cool supergiant stars, but the latter effect is much weaker at optical and UV wavelengths and Eta Carinae is the only clear instance detected of an ultraviolet <a href="astrophysical%20laser">astrophysical laser</a>. A similar effect from pumping of metastable O states by Ly emission has also been confirmed as an astrophysical UV laser.

Infrared observations of Eta Carinae have become increasingly important. The vast majority of the electromagnetic radiation from the central stars is absorbed by surrounding dust, then emitted as <a href="mid-infrared">mid-</a> and <a href="far%20infrared">far infrared</a> appropriate to the temperature of the dust. This allows almost the entire energy output of the system to be observed at wavelengths that are not strongly affected by <a href="Extinction%20%28astronomy%29">interstellar extinction</a>, leading to estimates of the luminosity that are more accurate than for other <a href="List%20of%20most%20luminous%20known%20stars">extremely luminous stars</a>. Eta Carinae is the brightest source in the night sky at mid-infrared wavelengths.

Far infrared observations show a large mass of dust at 100–150 K, suggesting a total mass for the Homunculus of 20 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es () or more. This is much larger than previous estimates, and is all thought to have been ejected in a few years during the Great Eruption.

<a href="Near-infrared">Near-infrared</a> observations can penetrate the dust at high resolution to observe features that are completely obscured at visual wavelengths, although not the central stars themselves. The central region of the Homunculus contains a smaller "Little Homunculus" from the 1890 eruption, a "butterfly" of separate clumps and filaments from the two eruptions, and an elongated stellar wind region.

Several <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> and <a href="gamma-ray">gamma-ray</a> sources have been detected around Eta Carinae, for example 4U 1037–60 in the 4th <a href="Uhuru%20%28satellite%29">Uhuru</a> catalogue and 1044–59 in the <a href="HEAO-2">HEAO-2</a> catalog. The earliest detection of X-rays in the Eta Carinae region was from the Terrier-Sandhawk rocket, followed by <a href="Ariel%205">Ariel 5</a>, <a href="OSO%208">OSO 8</a>, and Uhuru sightings.

More detailed observations were made with the <a href="Einstein%20Observatory">Einstein Observatory</a>, <a href="ROSAT">ROSAT</a> X-ray telescope, <a href="Advanced%20Satellite%20for%20Cosmology%20and%20Astrophysics">Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics</a> (ASCA), and <a href="Chandra%20X-ray%20Observatory">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a>. There are multiple sources at various wavelengths right across the high energy electromagnetic spectrum: hard X-rays and gamma rays within 1 light-month of the Eta Carinae; hard X-rays from a central region about 3 light-months wide; a distinct partial ring "horse-shoe" structure in low energy X-rays 0.67 parsec (2.2 light-years) across corresponding to the main shockfront from the Great Eruption; diffuse X-ray emission across the whole area of the Homunculus; and numerous condensations and arcs outside the main ring.

All the high energy emission associated with Eta Carinae varies during the orbital cycle. A spectroscopic minimum, or X-ray eclipse, occurred in July and August 2003 and similar events in 2009 and 2014 have been intensively observed. The highest energy gamma-rays above 100 <a href="Electronvolt">MeV</a> detected by <a href="AGILE%20%28satellite%29">AGILE</a> show strong variability, while lower energy gamma-rays observed by <a href="Fermi%20%28satellite%29">Fermi</a> show little variability.

<a href="radio%20astronomy">Radio</a> emissions have been observed from Eta Carinae across the <a href="microwave">microwave</a> band. It has been detected in the <a href="hydrogen%20line">21 cm</a> H line, but has been particularly closely studied in the <a href="millimetre%20wave">millimetre</a> and <a href="Super%20high%20frequency">centimetre bands</a>. <a href="Maser">Masing</a> hydrogen <a href="recombination%20line">recombination line</a>s (from the combining of an electron and proton to form a hydrogen atom) have been detected in this range. The emission is concentrated in a small non-point source less than 4 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s across and appears to be mainly free-free emission (thermal <a href="bremsstrahlung">bremsstrahlung</a>) from ionised gas, consistent with a compact H region at around 10,000 K. High resolution imaging shows the radio frequencies originating from a disk a few arcseconds in diameter, 10,000 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU) wide at the distance of Eta Carinae.

The radio emission from Eta Carinae shows continuous variation in strength and distribution over a 5.5 year cycle. The H and recombination lines vary very strongly, with continuum emission (electromagnetic radiation across a broad band of wavelengths) less affected. This shows a dramatic reduction in the ionisation level of the hydrogen for a short period in each cycle, coinciding with the spectroscopic events at other wavelengths.

Eta Carinae is found within the Carina Nebula, a giant <a href="star-forming%20region">star-forming region</a> in the <a href="Carina%E2%80%93Sagittarius%20Arm">Carina–Sagittarius Arm</a> of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. The nebula is a prominent naked eye object in the southern skies showing a complex mix of emission, reflection, and dark nebulosity. Eta Carinae is known to be at the same distance as the Carina Nebula and its spectrum can be seen reflected off various star clouds in the nebula. The appearance of the Carina Nebula, and particularly of the Keyhole region, has changed significantly since it was described by <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a> over years ago. This is thought to be due to the reduction in ionising radiation from Eta Carinae since the Great Eruption. Prior to the Great Eruption the Eta Carinae system contributed up to 20% of the total ionizing flux for the whole Carina Nebula, but that is now mostly blocked by the surrounding gas and dust.

Eta Carinae lies within the scattered stars of the Trumpler 16 <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>. All the other members are well below naked eye visibility, although <a href="WR%2025">WR 25</a> is another extremely massive luminous star. Trumpler 16 and its neighbour <a href="Trumpler%2014">Trumpler 14</a> are the two dominant star clusters of the <a href="Carina%20OB1">Carina OB1</a> association, an extended grouping of young luminous stars with a common motion through space.

Eta Carinae is enclosed by, and lights up, the <a href="Homunculus%20Nebula">Homunculus Nebula</a>, a small emission and reflection nebula composed mainly of gas ejected during the Great Eruption event in the mid-19th century, as well as dust that condensed from the debris. The nebula consists of two <a href="bipolar%20nebula">polar lobes</a> aligned with the rotation axis of the star, plus an equatorial "skirt", the whole being around long. Closer studies show many fine details: a "Little Homunculus" within the main nebula, probably formed by the 1890 eruption; a jet; fine streams and knots of material, especially noticeable in the skirt region; and three Weigelt Blobs—dense gas condensations very close to the star itself.

The lobes of the Homunculus are considered to be formed almost entirely due to the initial eruption, rather than shaped by or including previously ejected or interstellar material, although the scarcity of material near the equatorial plane allows some later stellar wind and ejected material to mix. Therefore, the mass of the lobes gives an accurate measure of the scale of the Great Eruption, with estimates ranging from up to as high as . The results show that the material from the Great Eruption is strongly concentrated towards the poles; 75% of the mass and 90% of the kinetic energy were released above latitude 45°.

A unique feature of the Homunculus is the ability to measure the spectrum of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a "polar wind" where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing <a href="gravity%20darkening">gravity brightening</a> towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer envelope of Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the <a href="gravity%20darkening">gravity darkening</a>. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may be due to interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.

The distance to Eta Carinae has been determined by several different methods, resulting in a widely accepted value of 2,300 parsecs (7,800 light-years), with a margin of error around 100 parsecs (330 light-years). The distance to Eta Carinae itself cannot be measured using <a href="Stellar%20parallax">parallax</a> due to its surrounding nebulosity, but other stars in the Trumpler 16 cluster are expected to be at a similar distance and are acessible to parallax. <a href="Gaia%20Data%20Release%202">Gaia Data Release 2</a> has provided the parallax for many stars considered to be members of Trumpler 16, finding that the four hottest O-class stars in the region have very similar parallaxes with a mean value of 0.383 ± 0.017 milli-arcseconds (mas), which translates to a distance of 2,600 ± 100 parsecs. This implies that Eta Carinae may be more distant than previously thought, and also more luminous, although it is still possible that it is not at the same distance as the cluster or that the parallax measurements have large systematic errors.

The distances to star clusters can be estimated by using a <a href="Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell%20diagram">Hertzsprung–Russell diagram</a> or <a href="Color%E2%80%93color%20diagram">colour–colour diagram</a> to calibrate the <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a>s of the stars, for example fitting the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> or identifying features such as a <a href="horizontal%20branch">horizontal branch</a>, and hence their distance from Earth. It is also necessary to know the amount of interstellar extinction to the cluster and this can be difficult in regions such as the Carina Nebula. A distance of 7,330 light-years (2,250 parsecs) has been determined from the calibration of O-type star luminosities in Trumpler 16. After determining an abnormal reddening correction to the extinction, the distance to both Trumpler 14 and Trumpler 16 has been measured at 9,500±1000 light-years (2,900±300 parsecs).

The known expansion rate of the Homunculus Nebula provides an unusual geometric method for measuring its distance. Assuming that the two lobes of the nebula are symmetrical, the projection of the nebula onto the sky depends on its distance. Values of 2,300, 2,250 and 2,300 parsecs have been derived for the Homunculus, and Eta Carinae is clearly at the same distance.

The Eta Carinae star system is currently one of the <a href="List%20of%20most%20massive%20known%20stars">most massive</a> that can be studied in great detail. Until recently Eta Carinae was thought to be the most massive single star, but the system's binary nature was proposed by the Brazilian astronomer Augusto Damineli in 1996 and confirmed in 2005. Both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from Eta Carinae A, and basic properties such as their temperatures and luminosities can only be inferred. Rapid changes to the stellar wind in the 21st century suggest that the star itself may be revealed as dust from the great eruption finally clears.

The binary nature of Eta Carinae is clearly established, although the components have not been directly observed and cannot even be clearly resolved spectroscopically due to scattering and re-excitation in the surrounding nebulosity. Periodic photometric and spectroscopic variations prompted the search for a companion, and modelling of the colliding winds and partial "eclipses" of some spectroscopic features have constrained the possible orbits.

The period of the orbit is accurately known at 5.539 years, although this has changed over time due to mass loss and accretion. The period between the Great Eruption and the smaller 1890 eruption was apparently 5.52 years, while before the Great Eruption it may have been lower still, possibly between 4.8 and 5.4 years. The orbital separation is only known approximately, with a semi-major axis of 15–16 AU. The orbit is highly eccentric, e = 0.9. This means that the separation of the stars varies from around 1.6 AU, similar to the distance of Mars from the Sun, to 30 AU, similar to the distance of Neptune.

Perhaps the most valuable use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. The dimensions of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide the masses of the two components.

Eta Carinae A is classified as a <a href="luminous%20blue%20variable">luminous blue variable</a> (LBV) due to the distinctive spectral and brightness variations. This type of <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a> is characterised by irregular changes from a high temperature quiescent state to a low temperature outburst state at roughly constant luminosity. LBVs in the quiescent state lie on a narrow <a href="S%20Doradus">S Doradus</a> instability strip, with more luminous stars being hotter. In outburst all LBVs have about the same temperature, which is near 8,000 K. LBVs in a normal outburst are visually brighter than when quiescent although the <a href="wikt%3Abolometric%20magnitude">bolometric</a> luminosity is unchanged.

A Great Eruption event similar to Eta Carinae A's has only been observed in one other star in the Milky Way—<a href="P%20Cygni">P Cygni</a>—and in a handful of other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called <a href="supernova%20impostor">supernova impostor</a>s, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.

Eta Carinae A is not a typical LBV. It is more luminous than any other LBV in the Milky Way although possibly comparable to other supernova impostors detected in external galaxies. It does not currently lie on the S Doradus instability strip, although it is unclear what the temperature or spectral type of the underlying star actually is, and during its Great Eruption it was much cooler than a typical LBV outburst. The 1890 eruption may have been fairly typical of LBV eruptions, with an early F spectral type, and it has been estimated that the star may currently have an opaque stellar wind forming a pseudo-photosphere with a temperature of 9,000 K–14,000 K which would be typical for an LBV in eruption.

Eta Carinae B is a massive luminous hot star, about which little else is known. From certain high excitation spectral lines that ought not to be produced by the primary, Eta Carinae B is thought to be a young <a href="O-type%20star">O-type star</a>. Most authors suggest it is a somewhat evolved star such as a supergiant or giant, although a <a href="Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet%20star">Wolf–Rayet star</a> cannot be ruled out.

The masses of stars are difficult to measure except by determination of a binary orbit. Eta Carinae is a binary system, but certain key information about the orbit is not known accurately. The mass can be strongly constrained to be greater than , due to the high luminosity. Standard models of the system assume masses of and for the primary and secondary respectively. Higher masses have been suggested, to model the energy output and mass transfer of the Great Eruption, with a combined system mass of over before the Great Eruption. Eta Carinae A has clearly lost a great deal of mass since it formed and it is expected that it was initially , although it may have formed through binary merger.

Mass loss is one of the most intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, observed mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution do not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types of <a href="Supernova%23Core%20collapse">core collapse supernovae</a>, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is an obvious candidate for study.

Eta Carinae A is losing a lot of mass due to its extreme luminosity and relatively low surface gravity. Its stellar wind is entirely opaque and appears as a pseudo-photosphere; this optically dense surface hides the true physical surface of the star. During the Great Eruption the mass loss rate was a thousand times higher, around /year sustained for ten years or more. The total mass loss during the eruption was at least with much of it now forming the Homunculus Nebula. The smaller 1890 eruption produced the "Little Homunculus Nebula", much smaller and only about . The bulk of the mass loss occurs in a wind with a terminal velocity of about 420 km/s, but some material is seen at higher velocities, up to 3,200 km/s, possibly material blown from the accretion disk by the secondary star.

Eta Carinae B is presumably also losing mass via a thin fast stellar wind, but this cannot be detected directly. Models of the radiation observed from interactions between the winds of the two stars show a mass loss rate of the order of /year at speeds of 3,000 km/s, typical of a hot O class star. For a portion of the highly <a href="Orbital%20eccentricity">eccentric</a> orbit, it may actually gain material from the primary via an <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a>. During the Great Eruption of the primary, the secondary could have accreted , producing strong jets which formed the bipolar shape of the Homunculus Nebula.

The stars of the Eta Carinae system are completely obscured by dust and opaque stellar winds, with much of the ultraviolet and visual radiation shifted to infrared. The total electromagnetic radiation across all wavelengths for both stars combined is several million solar luminosities (). The best estimate for the luminosity of the primary is making it one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy. The luminosity of Eta Carinae B is particularly uncertain, probably and almost certainly no more than .

The most notable feature of Eta Carinae is its giant eruption or supernova impostor event, which originated in the primary star and was observed around 1843. In a few years, it produced almost as much visible light as a faint supernova explosion, but the star survived. It is estimated that at peak brightness the luminosity was as high as . Other supernova impostors have been seen in other galaxies, for example the possible false supernova <a href="SN%201961v">SN 1961v</a> in <a href="NGC%201058">NGC 1058</a> and <a href="SN%202006jc">SN 2006jc</a>'s pre-explosion outburst in <a href="UGC%204904">UGC 4904</a>.

Following the Great Eruption, Eta Carinae became self-obscured by the ejected material, resulting in dramatic reddening. This has been estimated at four magnitudes at visual wavelengths, meaning the post-eruption luminosity was comparable to the luminosity when first identified. Eta Carinae is still much brighter at infrared wavelengths, despite the presumed hot stars behind the nebulosity. The recent visual brightening is considered to be largely caused by a decrease in the extinction, due to thinning dust or a reduction in mass loss, rather than an underlying change in the luminosity.

Until late in the 20th century, the temperature of Eta Carinae was assumed to be over 30,000 K because of the presence of high excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this. It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.

The powerful stellar winds from the two stars collide in a roughly conical WWC zone and produce temperatures as high as at the apex between the two stars. This zone is the source of the hard x-rays and gamma-rays close to the stars. Near periastron, as the secondary ploughs through ever denser regions of the primary wind, the colliding wind zone becomes distorted into a spiral trailing behind Eta Carinae B.

The wind-wind collision cone separates the winds of the two stars. For 55–75° behind the secondary, there is a thin hot wind typical of O or Wolf–Rayet stars. This allows some radiation from Eta Carinae B to be detected and its temperature can be estimated with some accuracy due to spectral lines that are unlikely to be produced by any other source. Although the secondary star has never been directly observed, there is widespread agreement on models where it has a temperature between 37,000 K and 41,000 K.

In all other directions on the other side of the wind-wind collision zone, there is the wind from Eta Carinae A, cooler and around 100 times denser than Eta Carinae B's wind. It is also optically dense, completely obscuring anything resembling a true photosphere and rendering any definition of its temperature moot. The observable radiation originates from a pseudo-photosphere where the <a href="optical%20density">optical density</a> of the wind drops to near zero, typically measured at a particular <a href="Opacity%20%28optics%29">Rossland opacity</a> value such as . This pseudo-photosphere is observed to be elongated and hotter along the presumed axis of rotation.

Eta Carinae A is likely to have appeared as an early B <a href="hypergiant">hypergiant</a> with a temperature of between 20,000 K and 25,000 K at the time of its discovery by Halley. An <a href="effective%20temperature">effective temperature</a> determined for the surface of a spherical optically thick wind at would be 9,400–15,000 K, while the temperature of a theoretical hydrostatic "core" at <a href="Optical%20depth%20%28astrophysics%29">optical depth</a> 150 would be 35,200 K. The effective temperature of the visible outer edge of the opaque primary wind is generally treated as being 15,000 K–25,000 K on the basis of visual and ultraviolet spectral features assumed to be directly from the wind or reflected via the Weigelt Blobs.

The Homunculus contains dust at temperatures varying from 150 K to 400 K. This is the source of almost all the infrared radiation that makes Eta Carinae such a bright object at those wavelengths.

Further out, expanding gases from the Great Eruption collide with interstellar material and are heated to around , producing less energetic X-rays seen in a horseshoe or ring shape.

The size of the two main stars in the Eta Carinae system is difficult to determine precisely because neither star can be seen directly. Eta Carinae B is likely to have a well-defined photosphere and its radius can be estimated from the assumed type of star. An O supergiant of with a temperature of 37,200 K has an effective radius of .

The size of Eta Carinae A is not even well defined. It has an optically dense stellar wind so the typical definition of a star's surface being approximately where it becomes opaque gives a very different result to where a more traditional definition of a surface might be. One study calculated a radius of for a hot "core" of 35,000 K at <a href="optical%20depth">optical depth</a> 150, near the sonic point or very approximately what might be called a physical surface. At optical depth 0.67 the radius would be , indicating an extended optically thick stellar wind. At the peak of the Great Eruption the radius, so far as such a thing is meaningful during such a violent expulsion of material, would have been around , comparable to the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20stars">largest known stars</a>, including <a href="VY%20Canis%20Majoris">VY Canis Majoris</a>.

The stellar sizes should be compared with their orbital separation, which is only around at periastron. The accretion radius of the secondary is around , suggesting strong accretion near periastron leading to a collapse of the secondary wind. It has been proposed that the initial brightening from 4th magnitude to 1st at relatively constant bolometric luminosity was a normal LBV outburst, albeit from an extreme example of the class. Then the companion star passing through the expanded photosphere of the primary at periastron triggered the further brightening, increase in luminosity, and extreme mass loss of the Great Eruption.

Rotation rates of massive stars have a critical influence on their evolution and eventual death. The rotation rate of the Eta Carinae stars cannot be measured directly because their surfaces cannot be seen. Single massive stars spin down quickly due to braking from their strong winds, but there are hints that both Eta Carinae A and B are fast rotators, up to 90% of critical velocity. One or both could have been spun up by binary interaction, for example accretion onto the secondary and orbital dragging on the primary.

Eta Carinae is a unique object, with no very close analogues currently known in any galaxy. Therefore, its future evolution is highly uncertain, but almost certainly involves further mass loss and an eventual supernova.

Eta Carinae A would have begun life as an extremely hot star on the main sequence, already a highly luminous object over . The exact properties would depend on the initial mass, which is expected to have been at least and possibly much higher. A typical spectrum when first formed would be O2If and the star would be mostly or fully <a href="stellar%20structure">convective</a> due to CNO cycle fusion at the very high core temperatures. Sufficiently massive or <a href="Differential%20rotation">differentially rotating</a> stars undergo such strong mixing that they remain chemically homogeneous during core hydrogen burning.

As core hydrogen burning progresses, a very massive star would slowly expand and become more luminous, becoming a blue hypergiant and eventually an LBV while still fusing hydrogen in the core. When hydrogen at the core is depleted after 2–2.5 million years, <a href="Stellar%20evolution%23Mature%20stars">hydrogen shell burning</a> continues with further increases in size and luminosity, although hydrogen shell burning in chemically homogeneous stars may be very brief or absent since the entire star would become depleted of hydrogen. In the late stages of hydrogen burning, mass loss is extremely high due to the high luminosity and enhanced surface abundances of helium and nitrogen. As hydrogen burning ends and <a href="Stellar%20evolution%23Massive%20stars">core helium burning</a> begins, massive stars transition very rapidly to the Wolf–Rayet stage with little or no hydrogen, increased temperatures, and decreased luminosity. They are likely to have lost over half their initial mass at this point.

It is unclear whether <a href="triple-alpha%20process">triple-alpha</a> helium fusion has started at the core of Eta Carinae A. The elemental abundances at the surface cannot be accurately measured, but ejecta within the Homunculus are around 60% hydrogen and 40% helium, with nitrogen enhanced to ten times solar levels. This is indicative of ongoing CNO cycle hydrogen fusion.

Models of the evolution and death of single very massive stars predict an increase in temperature during helium core burning, with the outer layers of the star being lost. It becomes a Wolf–Rayet star on the <a href="Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet%20star%23Classification">nitrogen sequence</a>, moving from WNL to WNE as more of the outer layers are lost, possibly reaching the WC or WO spectral class as carbon and oxygen from the triple alpha process reach the surface. This process would continue with heavier elements being fused until an iron core develops, at which point the core collapses and the star is destroyed. Subtle differences in initial conditions, in the models themselves, and most especially in the rates of mass loss, produce different predictions for the final state of the most massive stars. They may survive to become a helium-stripped star or they may collapse at an earlier stage while they retain more of their outer layers. The lack of sufficiently luminous WN stars and the discovery of apparent LBV supernova progenitors has also prompted the suggestion that certain types of LBVs explode as a supernova without evolving further.

Eta Carinae is a close binary and this complicates the evolution of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars much more quickly than would occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, making it difficult to predict future developments.

The overwhelming probability is that the next supernova observed in the Milky Way will originate from an unknown white dwarf or anonymous red supergiant, very likely not even visible to the naked eye. Nevertheless, the prospect of a supernova originating from an object as extreme, nearby, and well-studied as Eta Carinae arouses great interest.

As a single star, a star originally around 150 times as massive as the Sun would typically reach core collapse as a Wolf–Rayet star within 3 million years. At low metallicity, many massive stars will collapse directly to a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> with no visible explosion or a sub-luminous supernova, and a small fraction will produce a <a href="pair-instability%20supernova">pair-instability supernova</a>, but at solar metallicity and above there is expected to be sufficient mass loss before collapse to allow a visible supernova of <a href="Type%20Ib%20and%20Ic%20supernovae">type Ib or Ic</a>. If there is still a large amount of expelled material close to the star, the shock formed by the supernova explosion impacting the circumstellar material can efficiently convert <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> to <a href="radiation">radiation</a>, resulting in a <a href="superluminous%20supernova">superluminous supernova</a> (SLSN) or <a href="hypernova">hypernova</a>, several times more luminous than a typical core collapse supernova and much longer-lasting. Highly massive progenitors may also eject sufficient <a href="nickel">nickel</a> to cause a SLSN simply from the <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a>. The resulting remnant would be a black hole since it is highly unlikely such a massive star could ever lose sufficient mass for its core not to exceed the limit for a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>.

The existence of a massive companion brings many other possibilities. If Eta Carinae A was rapidly stripped of its outer layers, it might be a less massive WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached. This would result in a type Ib or type Ic supernova due to the lack of hydrogen and possibly helium. This supernova type is thought to be the originator of certain classes of gamma ray bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars.

Several unusual supernovae and impostors have been compared to Eta Carinae as examples of its possible fate. One of the most compelling is <a href="SN%202009ip">SN 2009ip</a>, a blue supergiant which underwent a supernova impostor event in 2009 with similarities to Eta Carinae's Great Eruption, then an even brighter outburst in 2012 which is likely to have been a true supernova. SN 2006jc, some 77 million light years away in UGC 4904, in the constellation <a href="Lynx%20%28constellation%29">Lynx</a>, also underwent a supernova impostor brightening in 2004, followed by a magnitude 13.8 type Ib supernova, first seen on 9 October 2006. Eta Carinae has also been compared to other possible supernova impostors such as <a href="SN%201961V">SN 1961V</a>, and to superluminous supernovae such as <a href="SN%202006gy">SN 2006gy</a>.

A typical core collapse supernova at the distance of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to <a href="Venus">Venus</a>. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently <a href="SN%201006">SN 1006</a>). At 7,500 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from the star it is unlikely to directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the <a href="magnetosphere">magnetosphere</a>. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the <a href="ozone%20layer">ozone layer</a>, spacecraft, including <a href="satellite">satellite</a>s, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible <a href="melatonin">melatonin</a> suppression with resulting <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a> and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.

Eta Carinae is not expected to produce a gamma-ray burst and its axis is not currently aimed near Earth. A gamma-ray burst in any case would need to be within a few light years of Earth to have significant effects. The Earth's atmosphere protects us from all the radiation apart from UV light (it is opaque to gamma rays which have to be observed using space telescopes). The main effect would be due to damage to the ozone layer. Eta Carinae is too far away to do that even if it did produce a gamma ray burst.

She serves on the board of the <a href="Children%27s%20Defense%20Fund">Children's Defense Fund</a> (CDF) and was named Global Ambassador of <a href="Avon%20Products">Avon Products</a> in 2007, serving as honorary chair of the charitable Avon Foundation. She received a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> in 2010.

Witherspoon was born on March 22, 1976 at <a href="Ochsner%20Baptist%20Medical%20Center">Southern Baptist Hospital</a>, in <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, while her father, Dr. John Draper Witherspoon, was a student at <a href="Tulane%20University">Tulane University</a> medical school. Dr. Witherspoon was born in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> and served as a lieutenant in the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Reserve">United States Army Reserve</a>. He was in private practice as an <a href="Otolaryngology">otolaryngologist</a> until 2012. Her mother, Dr. Mary Elizabeth "Betty" (née Reese), is from <a href="Harriman%2C%20Tennessee">Harriman, Tennessee</a>. Dr. Betty Witherspoon earned five degrees in total, including a Ph.D in pediatric nursing. She became a professor of nursing at <a href="Vanderbilt%20University">Vanderbilt University</a>. Witherspoon has claimed descent from Scottish-born <a href="John%20Witherspoon">John Witherspoon</a>, who signed the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a>; however, this claim has not been verified by the Society of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence genealogists. Her parents are still legally married, although they separated in 1996.

Witherspoon was raised as an <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28USA%29">Episcopalian</a>, and has said she is proud of the "definitive <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20Southern%20United%20States">Southern</a> upbringing" which she received. She said that it gave her "a sense of family and tradition" and taught her about "being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted what you have in your life". At the age of seven, Witherspoon was selected as a model for a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons. At age eleven, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair. Witherspoon received high grades in school, loved reading, and considered herself "a big dork who read loads of books". On mentioning her love for books, she said, "I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because I want to buy everything." She has been described as a "multi-achiever" and was given the nickname "Little Type A" by her parents. Witherspoon attended middle school at <a href="Harding%20Academy%20%28Nashville%29">Harding Academy</a> and graduated from the all-girls' <a href="Harpeth%20Hall%20School">Harpeth Hall School</a> in Nashville, during which time she was a <a href="cheerleader">cheerleader</a>. She later attended <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a> as an English literature major, but left the school prior to completing her studies to pursue an acting career.

In 1991, Witherspoon attended an open casting call for "<a href="The%20Man%20in%20the%20Moon">The Man in the Moon</a>", intending to audition as a bit player; she was instead cast for the lead role of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old country girl who falls in love for the first time with her 17-year-old neighbor. According to "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", her performance made an early impression. On her performance, <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> commented, "Her first kiss is one of the most perfect little scenes I've ever seen in a movie." For this role, Witherspoon was nominated for the <a href="Young%20Artist%20Award">Young Artist Award</a> Best Young Actress. Later that year, she made her television debut role in "<a href="Wildflower%20%281991%20film%29">Wildflower</a>" with <a href="Patricia%20Arquette">Patricia Arquette</a>. In 1992, Witherspoon appeared in the TV movie "Desperate Choices: To Save My Child", portraying a critically ill young girl.

In 1993, she played a young wife in the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> miniseries "<a href="Return%20to%20Lonesome%20Dove">Return to Lonesome Dove</a>", Nonnie Parker in the <a href="Disney">Disney</a> film "<a href="A%20Far%20Off%20Place">A Far Off Place</a>" and had a minor role in "<a href="Jack%20the%20Bear">Jack the Bear</a>", which garnered her the Young Artist Award for Best Youth Actress Co-star. The next year, Witherspoon had another leading role as Wendy Pfister in the 1994 film "<a href="S.F.W.">S.F.W.</a>", directed by <a href="Jefery%20Levy">Jefery Levy</a>. In 1996, Witherspoon starred in two major films: the thriller "<a href="Fear%20%281996%20film%29">Fear</a>" alongside <a href="Mark%20Wahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a>, as Nicole Walker, a teenage girl who starts dating a man with obsessive tendencies, and the black-comedy thriller "<a href="Freeway%20%281996%20film%29">Freeway</a>", alongside <a href="Kiefer%20Sutherland">Kiefer Sutherland</a> and <a href="Brooke%20Shields">Brooke Shields</a>, where she held the lead role. Her character in "Freeway", Vanessa Lutz, is a poor girl living in Los Angeles, who encounters a <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a> on the way to her grandmother's home in <a href="Stockton%2C%20California">Stockton</a>. The film received positive reviews from the press. Among them was the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>", with <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> commenting, "Witherspoon, who does a Texas accent, is dazzling, utterly believable in one extreme situation after the other." Witherspoon's performance won her the Best Actress Award at the <a href="Festival%20du%20Film%20Policier%20de%20Cognac">Cognac Police Film Festival</a> and helped establish her as a rising star. The making of the film also gave Witherspoon significant acting experience; as she said, "Once I overcame the hurdle of that movie – which scared me to death – I felt like I could try anything."

In 1998, Witherspoon had major roles in three movies: "<a href="Overnight%20Delivery">Overnight Delivery</a>", "<a href="Pleasantville%20%28film%29">Pleasantville</a>" and "<a href="Twilight%20%281998%20film%29">Twilight</a>". In "Pleasantville", she starred with <a href="Tobey%20Maguire">Tobey Maguire</a> in a tale about 1990s teenage siblings who are magically transported into the setting of a 1950s television series. She portrayed Jennifer, the sister of Maguire's character who is mainly concerned about appearances, relationships and popularity. Her performance received good reviews and garnered her the Young Hollywood Award for Best Female Breakthrough Performance. Director <a href="Gary%20Ross">Gary Ross</a> applauded her efforts saying, "she commits to a character so completely and she understands comedy".

In 1999, Witherspoon starred alongside <a href="Alessandro%20Nivola">Alessandro Nivola</a> in the drama thriller "<a href="Best%20Laid%20Plans%20%281999%20film%29">Best Laid Plans</a>"; she played Lissa, a woman who schemes with her lover Nick to escape a small dead-end town. Also that year co-starred with <a href="Sarah%20Michelle%20Gellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> and Ryan Phillippe in the drama film "<a href="Cruel%20Intentions">Cruel Intentions</a>", a modern take on the 18th-century French novel "<a href="Les%20Liaisons%20dangereuses">Les Liaisons Dangereuses</a>". "<a href="The%20San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">The San Francisco Chronicle</a>" praised her performance as Annette Hargrove: "Witherspoon is especially good in the least flashy role, and even when called upon to make a series of cute devilish faces, she pulls it off." She also appeared in a music video by <a href="Marcy%20Playground">Marcy Playground</a> for the film's soundtrack. The film became a box office success and a <a href="cult%20classic">cult classic</a>.

Next came perhaps Witherspoon's career-defining role: starring with <a href="Matthew%20Broderick">Matthew Broderick</a> in "<a href="Election%20%281999%20film%29">Election</a>", based on <a href="Tom%20Perrotta">Tom Perrotta</a>'s "<a href="Election%20%281998%20novel%29">novel</a>"; for her portrayal of <a href="Tracy%20Flick">Tracy Flick</a>, she received vast critical acclaim and won the Best Actress Award from the <a href="National%20Society%20of%20Film%20Critics">National Society of Film Critics</a> and the <a href="Online%20Film%20Critics%20Society">Online Film Critics Society</a>, a first <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a> nomination and an <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Award">Independent Spirit Award</a> nomination. Witherspoon also received a rank on the list of "100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time" by "<a href="Premiere%20%28magazine%29">Premiere</a>". Director <a href="Alexander%20Payne">Alexander Payne</a> said of her, "She's got that quality that men find attractive, while women would like to be her friend. But that's just the foundation. Nobody else is as funny or brings such charm to things. She can do anything."

In spite of her success with "Election", Witherspoon noted in an interview that she struggled to find work after completing the film due to <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecasting</a>. Analyzing the reasons behind her difficulty to find work, Witherspoon commented, "I think because the character I played was so extreme and sort of shrewish—people thought that was who I was, rather than me going in and creating a part. I would audition for things and I'd always be the second choice—studios never wanted to hire me and I wasn't losing the parts to big box office actresses but to ones who I guess people felt differently about." In 2000, Witherspoon played a supporting role in "<a href="American%20Psycho%20%28film%29">American Psycho</a>" as <a href="Patrick%20Bateman">Patrick Bateman</a>'s trophy girlfriend, and made a cameo appearance in "<a href="Little%20Nicky">Little Nicky</a>" as the mother of the <a href="Antichrist">Antichrist</a>. She also guest starred in season six of "<a href="Friends%20%28TV%20series%29">Friends</a>" as <a href="Rachel%20Green">Rachel Green</a>'s sister Jill.

The 2001 film "<a href="Legally%20Blonde">Legally Blonde</a>" marked a turning point in Witherspoon's career; she starred as Elle Woods, a fashion-merchandising major who decides to become a law student in order to follow her ex-boyfriend to <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a>. Witherspoon said about the role, "When I read "Legally Blonde", I was like, 'She's from Beverly Hills, she's rich, she's in a sorority. She has a great boyfriend. Oh yeah, she gets dumped. Who cares? I still hate her.' So we had to make sure she was the kind of person you just can't hate." "Legally Blonde" was a box-office hit, grossing US$96 million domestically. Witherspoon's performance earned her praise from critics as the press began referring to her as "the new <a href="Meg%20Ryan">Meg Ryan</a>". <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> commented, "Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit", and <a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon.com</a> noted that "she [Witherspoon] delineates Elle's character beautifully". Meanwhile, the "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>" concluded, "Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can perk up a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly." For her work, Witherspoon garnered her second <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe</a> Best Actress nomination and an <a href="2002%20MTV%20Movie%20Awards">MTV Movie Award</a> for Best Comedic Performance.

In 2002, after the success of "Legally Blonde", Witherspoon starred in several roles, such as Greta Wolfcastle in "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" episode "<a href="The%20Bart%20Wants%20What%20It%20Wants">The Bart Wants What It Wants</a>", and as Cecily in the comedy "<a href="The%20Importance%20of%20Being%20Earnest%20%282002%20film%29">The Importance of Being Earnest</a>", a film adaptation of <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>'s play in which she received a <a href="Teen%20Choice%20Award">Teen Choice Award</a> nomination. Later that year, she starred with <a href="Josh%20Lucas">Josh Lucas</a> and <a href="Patrick%20Dempsey">Patrick Dempsey</a> in <a href="Andy%20Tennant">Andy Tennant</a>'s film "<a href="Sweet%20Home%20Alabama%20%28film%29">Sweet Home Alabama</a>", where she played Melanie Carmichael, a young fashion designer who intends to marry a New York politician but must return to <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> to divorce her childhood sweetheart, from whom she has been separated for seven years. Witherspoon regarded this as a "personal role" in that it reminded her of experiences she had when she moved from her hometown Nashville to Los Angeles. The movie became Witherspoon's biggest live-action box office hit, earning over $35 million in the opening weekend and grossing over $127 million in the U.S. Despite the commercial success, critics gave "Sweet Home Alabama" negative reviews. It was called "a romantic comedy so rote, dull and predictable" by "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>", and the press widely agreed that Witherspoon was the only reason the movie attracted such a large audience. When describing Witherspoon's role in the movie, "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>" concluded, "She is not the movie's main attraction, she is its only attraction."

In 2003, Witherspoon followed up the success of "Legally Blonde" by starring in the sequel "". Elle Woods has become a Harvard-educated lawyer who is determined to protect animals from cosmetics industry science tests. The sequel was not as financially successful as the first film and it generated mostly negative reviews. "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" considered the movie "plodding, unfunny and almost cringe-worthy", but also noted that "Reese Witherspoon still does a fine job portraying the fair-haired lovable brainiac, but her top-notch comic timing is wasted on the humorless dialogue." Meanwhile, <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> concluded that the sequel "calcifies everything that was enjoyable about the first movie". Despite being panned by critics, the sequel took in over $39 million in its first five days in the U.S. box office charts and eventually grossed $90 million in the US. Witherspoon received a $15 million paycheck for the role—a starting point to make her consistently one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses from 2002 until 2010.

In 2004, Witherspoon starred in "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%282004%20film%29">Vanity Fair</a>", adapted from the 19th-century classic novel "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28novel%29">Vanity Fair</a>" and directed by <a href="Mira%20Nair">Mira Nair</a>. Her character, Becky Sharp, is a poor woman with a ruthless determination to find fortune and establish herself a position in society. Witherspoon was carefully costumed to conceal that during the filming she was pregnant with her second child. This pregnancy was not a hindrance to her work as Witherspoon believed the gestation had in fact helped her portrayal of Sharp's character: "I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom—it gave me much more to play with", she said. The film and Witherspoon's portrayal of Sharp received mixed reviews, as "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" wrote, "Nair's cast is splendid. Witherspoon does justice to the juicy role by giving the part more buoyancy than naughtiness." At the same time, "<a href="The%20Charlotte%20Observer">The Charlotte Observer</a>" called her work "an excellent performance that's soft around the edges" and the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" concluded that Becky is "a role Reese Witherspoon was born to play". However, "<a href="LA%20Weekly">LA Weekly</a>" wrote "[Witherspoon] ends up conveying so little of what's at once appalling and perversely attractive about the would-be mistress of Vanity Fair" and states that it may have to do with Witherspoon's vanity, "with an Oscar-less young star's need to be loved more than anyone could conceivably love the "real" Becky Sharp.". Others have stated she was miscast.

In late 2004, Witherspoon began working alongside <a href="Mark%20Ruffalo">Mark Ruffalo</a> on the romantic comedy "<a href="Just%20Like%20Heaven%20%28film%29">Just Like Heaven</a>". Her character, Elizabeth Masterson, is an ambitious young doctor who gets into a car accident on her way to a blind date and is left in a coma; her spirit returns to her old apartment where she later finds true love.
Earlier that year Witherspoon was chosen to portray <a href="June%20Carter%20Cash">June Carter Cash</a>, the second wife of country music singer-songwriter <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a> (<a href="Joaquin%20Phoenix">Joaquin Phoenix</a>), in "<a href="Walk%20the%20Line">Walk the Line</a>". She never had the chance to meet Carter Cash, as Witherspoon was filming "Vanity Fair" at the time the singer died. Witherspoon performed her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience, she was so worried about needing to perform live that she asked her lawyer to terminate the film contract. "That was the most challenging part of the role," she later recalled in an interview. "I'd never sung professionally." Subsequently, she had to spend six months learning how to sing for the role. Witherspoon's portrayal of Carter Cash was well received by critics, and Roger Ebert wrote that her performance added "boundless energy" to the movie. She won several awards for her performance, including the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Golden Globe Award</a>, the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a>, the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a> and the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> in a Lead Role. Besides critical success in the movie industry, Witherspoon and Phoenix received a nomination for "collaborative video of the year" from the <a href="CMT%20Music%20Awards">CMT Music Awards</a>. Witherspoon expressed her passion for the movie: "I really like in this film that it is realistic and portrays sort of a real marriage, a real relationship where there are forbidden thoughts and fallibility. And it is about compassion in the long haul, not just the short easy solutions to problems." She also stated that she believed Carter Cash was a woman ahead of her time: "I think the really remarkable thing about her character is that she did all of these things that we sort of see as normal things in the 1950s when it wasn't really acceptable for a woman to be married and divorced twice and have two different children by two different husbands and travel around in a car full of very famous musicians all by herself. She didn't try to comply to social convention, so I think that makes her a very modern woman."

Witherspoon's first post-Oscar role came in the modern-day fairy tale "<a href="Penelope%20%282006%20film%29">Penelope</a>", as Annie, the best friend of Penelope (<a href="Christina%20Ricci">Christina Ricci</a>), a girl who has a curse in her family. The film was produced by her company <a href="Type%20A%20Films">Type A Films</a>, with filming commencing in March 2006, immediately following Witherspoon's Oscar win for "Walk the Line". Although the movie premiered at the <a href="2006%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">2006 Toronto International Film Festival</a>, the final release date of "Penelope" was delayed twice before an eventual February 2008 release.

Following her critical success with "Walk the Line", Witherspoon admits to spending several years "kind of floundering career-wise". Reflecting on this period of time in a December 2014 interview, Witherspoon attributed it to her separation from her first husband in October 2006 and their subsequent divorce, stating that she spent "a few years just trying to feel better. You know, you can't really be very creative when you feel like your brain is scrambled eggs." She claims that she "wasn't making things I was passionate about. I was just kind of working, you know. And it was really clear that audiences weren't responding to anything I was putting out there."

This period of Witherspoon's career began with the filming of the abduction thriller "<a href="Rendition%20%28film%29">Rendition</a>" in November 2006. In the film, she plays Isabella El-Ibrahim, the pregnant wife of a bombing suspect. The film was released in October 2007 and marked Witherspoon's first appearance in theaters since the 2005 release of "Walk the Line". The movie received mostly mixed reviews and was generally considered a disappointment at the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>. Witherspoon's performance was also criticized: "Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly lifeless", Claudia Puig of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" wrote. "She customarily injects energy and spirit into her parts, but here, her performance feels tamped down."

Witherspoon was also the announcer of the <a href="Playhouse%20Disney">Playhouse Disney</a> block on Disney Channel, from March 31, 2007 to February 14, 2011.
In December 2007, Witherspoon began working with <a href="Vince%20Vaughn">Vince Vaughn</a>, filming the holiday comedy "<a href="Four%20Christmases">Four Christmases</a>", a story about a couple who must spend their Christmas Day trying to visit all four of their divorced parents. The film was released in November 2008. Despite being panned by critics, the movie became a box office success, earning more than $120 million domestically and $157 million worldwide. In 2009, Witherspoon voiced Susan Murphy, lead character in <a href="DreamWorks%20Animation">DreamWorks</a>' <a href="computer-animated">computer-animated</a> film "<a href="Monsters%20vs.%20Aliens">Monsters vs. Aliens</a>", released in March 2009, becoming her biggest hit at the time. She also co-produced the "Legally Blonde" spin-off "<a href="Legally%20Blondes">Legally Blondes</a>", starring <a href="Camilla%20and%20Rebecca%20Rosso">Milly and Becky Rosso</a>.

However, Witherspoon did not appear in a live-action film for two years after the 2008 release of "Four Christmases". She told "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" that the "break" was unplanned, stating that, "I just didn't read anything I liked... There are a lot of really, really, really big movies about robots and things—and there's not a part for a 34-year-old woman in a robot movie." Witherspoon returned with three films released in 2010, 2011 and 2012, all centered on her as a woman caught in a love triangle between two men. In a 2012 interview with <a href="MTV">MTV</a>, Witherspoon jokingly referred to this trio of films as her "love triangle period".

The first film was <a href="James%20L.%20Brooks">James L. Brooks</a>' romantic comedy "<a href="How%20Do%20You%20Know">How Do You Know</a>" which starred Witherspoon as a former national softball player who struggles to choose between a baseball-star boyfriend (<a href="Owen%20Wilson">Owen Wilson</a>) and a business executive being investigated for <a href="white-collar%20crime">white-collar crime</a> (<a href="Paul%20Rudd">Paul Rudd</a>). The movie was filmed in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> during the summer and fall of 2009 and released on December 17, 2010. The movie was both a critical and box office failure. Despite a budget of more than $100 million the film earned only $7.6 million in its opening weekend, leading the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" to call it "one of the year's biggest flops". The movie earned mainly negative reviews from critics, scoring 35% on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> with 111 reviews as of late December 2010.

Witherspoon's second love-triangle movie was the film adaptation of the 1930s circus drama "<a href="Water%20for%20Elephants%20%28film%29">Water for Elephants</a>". She began circus training in March 2010 for her role as Marlena, a glamorous performer stuck in a marriage to a volatile husband (<a href="Christoph%20Waltz">Christoph Waltz</a>) but intrigued by the circus's new veterinarian (<a href="Robert%20Pattinson">Robert Pattinson</a>). The movie was filmed between late May and early August 2010 in various locations in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, and <a href="California">California</a>. It was released on April 22, 2011 and received mixed critical reviews.

In September 2010, Witherspoon began <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> for the third and final love-triangle film, "<a href="This%20Means%20War%20%28film%29">This Means War</a>", a <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> spy comedy directed by <a href="McG">McG</a> in which Witherspoon's character is at the center of a battle between best friends (played by <a href="Chris%20Pine">Chris Pine</a> and <a href="Tom%20Hardy">Tom Hardy</a>) who are both in love with her. The film had a "sneak-peek" release on <a href="Valentine%27s%20Day">Valentine's Day</a>, before fully opening on February 17, 2012. The film was panned by critics (with a 25% <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> rating), and fared poorly at the box office, taking fifth place on its opening weekend with sales of $17.6 million. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" remarked that this "extended the box office cold streak for the Oscar-winning Ms. Witherspoon".

Witherspoon's subsequent films signaled a departure from the love-triangle theme. In September 2011, a year after beginning work on "This Means War", she filmed a small role in <a href="Jeff%20Nichols">Jeff Nichols</a>'s <a href="coming-of-age%20film">coming-of-age</a> drama "<a href="Mud%20%282012%20film%29">Mud</a>" in <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, playing Juniper, the former girlfriend of a fugitive (<a href="Matthew%20McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a>), who enlists two local boys to help him evade capture and rekindle his romance with her. "Mud" premiered in May 2012 in competition for the <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a> at the <a href="2012%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>, but did not win. Following its American debut at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a> on January 19, 2013, the film had a <a href="limited%20release">limited release</a> in select North American theaters on April 26, 2013.

Witherspoon next starred in "<a href="Devil%27s%20Knot%20%28film%29">Devil's Knot</a>", which is based on <a href="Atom%20Egoyan">Atom Egoyan</a>'s <a href="true%20crime">true crime</a> book of the <a href="Devil%27s%20Knot">same name</a> and examines the controversial case of the <a href="West%20Memphis%20Three">West Memphis Three</a>. Like "Mud", the film is set in <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>. Witherspoon played Pam Hobbs, the mother of one of three young murder victims. In an interview subsequent to her casting in the film, Egoyan noted that although the role requires "an emotionally loaded journey", he "met with Reese, and... talked at length about the project, and she's eager to take on the challenge". The movie was shot in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> in June and July 2012. Witherspoon was pregnant with her third child during filming. The film's world premiere was held on September 8, 2013 at the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>. It was then released in selected American theaters on May 9, 2014.

In April 2013, Witherspoon began production in Atlanta on Canadian director <a href="Philippe%20Falardeau">Philippe Falardeau</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Good%20Lie">The Good Lie</a>". It is based on real-life events, about a brash American woman assigned to help four young <a href="Refugees%20of%20Sudan">Sudanese refugees</a> (known as <a href="Lost%20Boys%20of%20Sudan">Lost Boys of Sudan</a>) who win a lottery for relocation to the U.S. It was released on October 3, 2014.

Witherspoon shot a small role in "<a href="Inherent%20Vice%20%28film%29">Inherent Vice</a>" (2014), an adaptation of <a href="Thomas%20Pynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a>'s <a href="Inherent%20Vice">novel</a>, in <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a> in summer 2013.

In 2012, Witherspoon started the production company Pacific Standard. The goal of the company was to produce movies with strong female lead roles, as she said that she was tired of seeing only movies with a strictly male focus being produced. Through the company, Witherspoon served as a producer in the <a href="Gone%20Girl%20%28film%29">film adaptation</a> of <a href="Gillian%20Flynn">Gillian Flynn</a>'s novel "<a href="Gone%20Girl%20%28novel%29">Gone Girl</a>", though she did not star. Indeed, Witherspoon and her producing partner "had little to do with the production of "Gone Girl"", leaving it to director <a href="David%20Fincher">David Fincher</a> while focusing their efforts on another adaptation produced via Pacific Standard, that of <a href="Cheryl%20Strayed">Cheryl Strayed</a>'s memoir "", which began production in fall 2013 on the same day as "Gone Girl". Witherspoon starred in the project, portraying Strayed herself on her hike along the <a href="Pacific%20Crest%20Trail">Pacific Crest Trail</a>. "<a href="Wild%20%282014%20film%29">Wild</a>" was released in December 2014 to critical acclaim; Michael Phillips of "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" wrote in his review, "Witherspoon does the least acting of her career, and it works. Calmly yet restlessly, she brings to life Strayed's longings, her states of grief and desire and her wary optimism." "Wild" was promoted as Witherspoon's primary "comeback" vehicle following her previous career slump, and she earned her second Academy Award nomination for the role.

In May 2014, Witherspoon began production in Louisiana on "<a href="Hot%20Pursuit%20%282015%20film%29">Hot Pursuit</a>", a comedy in which she plays a police officer trying to protect a drug lord's widow (<a href="Sof%C3%ADa%20Vergara">Sofía Vergara</a>). The movie was released on May 8, 2015. In 2016, she had a voice role in the animated film "<a href="Sing%20%282016%20American%20film%29">Sing</a>", as well as serving as a major performer on the film's soundtrack. The movie became Witherspoon's biggest hit, being the first to make over $200 million domestically and $600 million worldwide.

In January 2016, Witherspoon began filming her first television project since "Return To Lonesome Dove", <a href="Big%20Little%20Lies%20%28TV%20series%29">the seven-part miniseries adaptation</a> of the <a href="Liane%20Moriarty">Liane Moriarty</a> bestseller, "<a href="Big%20Little%20Lies%20%28novel%29">Big Little Lies</a>". She produced the miniseries, along with her co-star, <a href="Nicole%20Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a>, and the show's director, Jean-Marc Vallée, her second project under his direction. The series premiered on February 19, 2017 on <a href="HBO">HBO</a> and finished on April 2. Witherspoon has garnered critical acclaim for her performance, with <a href="TV%20Line">TV Line</a> proclaiming her as "Performer of the Week" of February 26 to March 4. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" compared her performance to her previous work in "Election" and "Legally Blonde".

In November 2016, Witherspoon began production on the romantic comedy "<a href="Home%20Again%20%282017%20film%29">Home Again</a>", the directorial debut of filmmaker <a href="Nancy%20Meyers">Nancy Meyers</a>' daughter, <a href="Hallie%20Meyers-Shyer">Hallie Meyers-Shyer</a>, which was released on September 8, 2017. A few months later, she began filming <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney's</a> "<a href="A%20Wrinkle%20in%20Time%20%282018%20film%29">A Wrinkle in Time</a>", the film adaptation of <a href="Madeleine%20L%27Engle">Madeleine L'Engle</a>'s <a href="A%20Wrinkle%20in%20Time">classic novel of the same name</a>, where she plays Mrs. Whatsit. The film was released in March 2018,
co-stars <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> and <a href="Mindy%20Kaling">Mindy Kaling</a>, and is directed by <a href="Ava%20DuVernay">Ava DuVernay</a>.

In July 2018, Witherspoon began hosting the talk show "<a href="Shine%20On%20with%20Reese">Shine On with Reese</a>" on <a href="DirecTV">DirecTV</a>. The show is a one-on-one interview between Witherspoon and a female guest focussing on how the guest achieved her dreams. Like "Big Little Lies," the show is produced by her production company "Hello Sunshine". The show marks Witherspoon's first unscripted role in television.

In December 2017, HBO renewed "Big Little Lies" for a second season making the series a regular <a href="drama%20series">drama series</a> series instead of a miniseries. The second season is expected to air in 2019. Witherspoon has also signed on to produce and star in <a href="Top%20of%20the%20Morning%20%28TV%20series%29">"Top of the Morning"</a> for <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> alongside <a href="Jennifer%20Aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a>. The series is currently filming.

Furthermore, Witherspoon will act and produce in the <a href="Hulu">Hulu</a> miniseries <a href="Little%20Fires%20Everywhere%20%28miniseries%29">"Little Fires Everywhere"</a>, the televised adaption of <a href="Celeste%20Ng">Celeste Ng</a>'s <a href="Little%20Fires%20Everywhere">2017 novel of the same name</a>. Witherspoon will also executive produce <a href="Are%20You%20Sleeping%20%28TV%20series%29">"Are You Sleeping"</a> and an untitled comedy series from <a href="Colleen%20McGuinness">Colleen McGuinness</a>, both set at Apple. Witherspoon will also serve as an executive producer for the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> comedy series based on the memoir "Americanized" from Sara Saedi. All upcoming series will be produced through her production company Hello Sunshine.

Witherspoon also has two films in pre-production as a producer, "A White Lie" and a documentary about <a href="Martina%20Navratilova">Martina Navratilova</a>.

Witherspoon owned a production company called Type A Films, which the media believed was a moniker honoring her childhood nickname "Little Miss Type A". However, when asked about the company by "<a href="Interview%20%28magazine%29">Interview</a>" magazine, she clarified the name's origin: "... people think I named it after myself... It was actually an <a href="in-joke">in-joke</a> with my family because at [age] 7 I understood complicated medical terms, such as the difference between <a href="Type%20A%20and%20Type%20B%20personality%20theory">type A and type B personalities</a>. But I just wished I'd named the company Dogfood Films or Fork or something. You carry that baggage all your life." In March 2012, Witherspoon merged Type A Films with producer <a href="Bruna%20Papandrea">Bruna Papandrea</a>'s Make Movies banner to create a new production company entitled Pacific Standard. In 2016, Witherspoon and Papandrea split up, with Witherspoon gaining full control over the company.

In November 2016, Witherspoon and <a href="Otter%20Media">Otter Media</a> formed <a href="Hello%20Sunshine%20%28company%29">Hello Sunshine</a>, a joint venture focused on telling female-driven stories on film, TV and digital platforms. Pacific Standard has become a subsidiary of Hello Sunshine.

In May 2015, Witherspoon launched <a href="Draper%20James">Draper James</a>, a retail brand with a focus on fashion, accessories and home décor inspired by the American South. The brand is named after Witherspoon's grandparents, Dorothea Draper and William James Witherspoon, who are said to be her greatest influences. Some of the products are being manufactured and designed in-house, and the brand launched direct to consumers online before opening its first brick and mortar store in fall 2015 in Witherspoon's hometown of <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>.

In October 2016, Witherspoon announced that she would be writing her first book. In April 2018, Witherspoon announced her first book <a href="Whiskey%20in%20a%20Teacup">Whiskey in a Teacup</a>. The book is a lifestyle book inspired by Witherspoon's southern upbringing and was released on September 18, 2018.

In March 2017, Witherspoon became the storyteller-in-chief for <a href="Elizabeth%20Arden%2C%20Inc.">Elizabeth Arden, Inc.</a>. There, she will be helping the company to shape the brand's narrative through advertising campaigns and marketing programs. Of her involvement, Witherspoon states that she is "excited to work as a creative partner alongside the Elizabeth Arden team, producing content that celebrates the spirit of the brand, highlighting female-centric stories that illustrate women's true life experiences which unite us all".

Witherspoon is actively involved in children's and women's advocacy organizations.

During this trip, she helped open the city's first Freedom School, as she met and talked with the children. Witherspoon later called this an experience that she would never forget.

In 2007, Witherspoon made her first move into the world of endorsements, as she signed a multi-year agreement to serve as the first Global Ambassador of cosmetic company <a href="Avon%20Products">Avon Products</a>. She acts as a spokeswoman for Avon's cosmetic products and serves as the honorary chair of the "Avon Foundation", a charitable organization that supports women and focuses on breast cancer research and the prevention of domestic violence.

Witherspoon and Toth announced their engagement in December 2010, and married on March 26, 2011, in <a href="Ojai%2C%20California">Ojai, California</a>, at Libbey Ranch, Witherspoon's country estate, which she later sold. The couple have a son together, born in September 2012.

In 2013, Witherspoon was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after her husband was pulled over for suspicion of DUI. She later pleaded no contest to obstruction and was required to pay court costs.

Witherspoon hosted "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" on September 29, 2001, the first episode to air after the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>. In 2005, she was ranked No. 5 in "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">Teen People</a>" magazine's list of most powerful young Hollywood actors. In 2006, Witherspoon was listed among the <a href="Time%20100">Time 100</a>. Her featured article was written by <a href="Luke%20Wilson">Luke Wilson</a>. In the same year, she was selected as one of the "<a href="FHM%27s%20100%20Sexiest%20Women%20%28UK%29">100 Sexiest Women In The World</a>" by the readers of "<a href="FHM">FHM</a>".

"<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" also put her on the top ten Trustworthy Celebrities list. She was listed among "CEOWorld Magazine"s Top Accomplished Women Entertainers.

In 2007, she was selected by "People" and the entertainment news program "<a href="Access%20Hollywood">Access Hollywood</a>" as one of the year's best-dressed female stars. She was also the announcer of the Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel from 2007 to 2011. The yellow dress she wore to that year's Golden Globe Awards was widely acclaimed. A study conducted by E-Poll Market Research showed that Witherspoon was the most likable female celebrity of 2007. That same year, Witherspoon established herself as the highest-paid actress in the American film industry, earning $15 to $20 million per film. In recent years, however, her appearance in a number of movies that fared badly at the box office caused a turnabout in her status, and she has been noted as one of the most overpaid actors in Hollywood in 2011, 2012 and 2013. In April 2011, Witherspoon ranked 3rd on the 22nd annual "People's Most Beautiful" issue. In 2010, Witherspoon received a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> at 6262 Hollywood Blvd.

In June 2013, Witherspoon filed suit against Marketing Advantages International Inc., claiming it used her name and image extensively in jewelry advertising without her permission, both throughout the United States and internationally. In December 2015, while Witherspoon's trademark claims to her name were rejected, for she had not established secondary meaning to her full name, that she did not claim "emotional distress" and the "photos and facts were generally known by the public and the photos were taken in public with Plaintiff's consent", the court ruled that she could proceed with her right of publicity claims against a number of defendants. Two months later, Witherspoon withdrew her lawsuit, having "come to private agreements with the various defendants, including Centerbrook Sales, Fragrance Hut, Gemvara, and others". In the wake of the <a href="Harvey%20Weinstein%20sexual%20abuse%20allegations">Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations</a>, Witherspoon revealed that she had been sexually assaulted by a director at the age of 16 and has had "multiple experiences of harassment and sexual assault" throughout her career.

In 2015, Witherspoon made her second appearance among the Time 100, with her featured article being written by <a href="Mindy%20Kaling">Mindy Kaling</a>. The same year, she was awarded, by a unanimous vote from the committee, the <a href="American%20Cinematheque">American Cinematheque</a> for being "a perfect example of an actress flourishing in today's world" and "an active and successful movie producer who is moving her career forward both behind and in front of the camera".

According to an article published by Forbes in 2017, Witherspoon is said to have $198 million-plus career earnings, which made her the top-paid primetime Emmy nominee that year.

Witherspoon has won numerous awards, including the BAFTA Award and the <a href="Academy%20Awards">Oscar</a> for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> for her performance in "<a href="Walk%20the%20Line">Walk the Line</a>" in 2005.

Sir William Turner Walton, <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">OM</a> (29 March 19028 March 1983) was an English composer. During a sixty-year career, he wrote music in several classical genres and styles, from film scores to opera. His best-known works include "<a href="Fa%C3%A7ade%20%28entertainment%29">Façade</a>", the <a href="cantata">cantata</a> "<a href="Belshazzar%27s%20Feast%20%28Walton%29">Belshazzar's Feast</a>", the <a href="Viola%20Concerto%20%28Walton%29">Viola Concerto</a>, the <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Walton%29">First Symphony</a>, and the <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">British coronation anthems</a> <a href="Crown%20Imperial%20%28march%29">"Crown Imperial"</a> and "<a href="Orb%20and%20Sceptre">Orb and Sceptre</a>".

Born in <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, the son of a musician, Walton was a chorister and then an undergraduate at <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>. On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary <a href="The%20Sitwells">Sitwell</a> siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with <a href="Edith%20Sitwell">Edith Sitwell</a>, "Façade", which at first brought him notoriety as a <a href="Modernism%20%28music%29">modernist</a>, but later became a popular ballet score.

In middle age, Walton left Britain and set up home with his young wife <a href="Susana%2C%20Lady%20Walton">Susana</a> on the Italian island of <a href="Ischia">Ischia</a>. By this time, he had ceased to be regarded as a modernist, and some of his compositions of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, "<a href="Troilus%20and%20Cressida%20%28opera%29">Troilus and Cressida</a>", was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics at the time of their premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works.

Walton was a slow worker, painstakingly perfectionist, and his complete body of work across his long career is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the 21st century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.

Walton was born into a musical family in <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, the second son in a family of three boys and a girl. His father, Charles Alexander Walton, was a musician who had trained at the <a href="Royal%20Northern%20College%20of%20Music">Royal Manchester College of Music</a> under <a href="Charles%20Hall%C3%A9">Charles Hallé</a>, and made a living as a singing teacher and church organist. Charles's wife, Louisa Maria ("née" Turner), had been a singer before their marriage. William Walton's musical talents were spotted when he was still a young boy, and he took piano and violin lessons, though he never mastered either instrument. He was more successful as a singer: he and his elder brother sang in their father's choir, taking part in performances of large-scale works by <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>, <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a> and others.

Walton was sent to a local school, but in 1912 his father saw a newspaper advertisement for probationer choristers at <a href="Christ%20Church%20Cathedral%20School">Christ Church Cathedral School</a> in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> and applied for William to be admitted. The boy and his mother missed their intended train from Manchester to Oxford because Walton's father had spent the money for the fare in a local public house. Louisa Walton had to borrow the fares from a <a href="greengrocer">greengrocer</a>. Although they arrived in Oxford after the entrance trials were over, Mrs Walton successfully pleaded for her son to be heard, and he was accepted.

He remained at the choir school for the next six years. The Dean of Christ Church, Dr <a href="Thomas%20Strong%20%28bishop%29">Thomas Strong</a>, noted the young Walton's musical potential and was encouraged in this view by <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Sir Hubert Parry</a>, who saw the manuscripts of some of Walton's early compositions and said to Strong, "There's a lot in this chap; you must keep your eye on him."

At the age of sixteen Walton became an undergraduate of <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church</a>. It is sometimes said that he was <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a>'s youngest undergraduate since <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>, and though this is probably not correct, he was nonetheless among the youngest. He came under the influence of <a href="Hugh%20Allen%20%28conductor%29">Hugh Allen</a>, the dominant figure in Oxford's musical life. Allen introduced Walton to <a href="Modernism%20%28music%29">modern music</a>, including <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky's</a> "<a href="Petrushka%20%28ballet%29">Petrushka</a>", and enthused him with "the mysteries of the orchestra". Walton spent much time in the university library, studying scores by Stravinsky, <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>, <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a>, <a href="Albert%20Roussel">Roussel</a> and others. He neglected his non-musical studies, and though he passed the musical examinations with ease, he failed the Greek and algebra examinations required for graduation.

Little survives from Walton's juvenilia, but the choral anthem "A Litany", written when he was fifteen, anticipates his mature style.
At Oxford Walton befriended several poets including <a href="Roy%20Campbell%20%28poet%29">Roy Campbell</a>, <a href="Siegfried%20Sassoon">Siegfried Sassoon</a> and, most importantly for his future, <a href="Sacheverell%20Sitwell">Sacheverell Sitwell</a>. Walton was sent down from Oxford in 1920 without a degree or any firm plans. Sitwell invited him to lodge in London with him and his literary brother and sister, <a href="Osbert%20Sitwell">Osbert</a> and <a href="Edith%20Sitwell">Edith</a>. Walton took up residence in the attic of their house in Chelsea, later recalling, "I went for a few weeks and stayed about fifteen years".

The Sitwells looked after their protégé both materially and culturally, giving him not only a home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music lessons with <a href="Ernest%20Ansermet">Ernest Ansermet</a>, <a href="Ferruccio%20Busoni">Ferruccio Busoni</a> and <a href="Edward%20Joseph%20Dent">Edward J. Dent</a>. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and <a href="George%20Gershwin">Gershwin</a>, heard the <a href="Savoy%20Orpheans">Savoy Orpheans</a> at the <a href="Savoy%20Hotel">Savoy Hotel</a> and wrote an experimental string quartet heavily influenced by the <a href="Second%20Viennese%20School">Second Viennese School</a> that was performed at a festival of new music at <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a> in 1923. <a href="Alban%20Berg">Alban Berg</a> heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a>, Berg's teacher and the founder of the Second Viennese School.

In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a "succès de scandale". "<a href="Fa%C3%A7ade%20%28poems%29">Façade</a>" was first performed in public at the <a href="Aeolian%20Hall%2C%20London">Aeolian Hall, London</a>, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer <a href="Michael%20Kennedy%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Kennedy</a> cites as typical a contemporary headline: "Drivel That They Paid to Hear". "<a href="The%20Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>" loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" wrote of "relentless cacophony". "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as "harmless". In "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>", Dent was much more appreciative: "The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention." In "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>", <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a> said of Walton, "as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water".

Among the audience were <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>, <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a> and <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>. The last was so outraged by the avant-garde nature of Sitwell's verses and the staging, that he marched out ostentatiously during the performance. The players did not like the music: the clarinettist, <a href="Charles%20Draper%20%28musician%29">Charles Draper</a> asked the composer, "Mr Walton, has a <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a> player ever done you an injury?" Nevertheless, the work soon became accepted, and within a decade Walton's music was used for the popular <a href="Fa%C3%A7ade%20%28ballet%29">"Façade" ballet</a>, choreographed by <a href="Frederick%20Ashton">Frederick Ashton</a>.
Walton's works of the 1920s, while he was living in the Sitwells' attic, include the <a href="overture">overture</a> "<a href="Portsmouth%20Point%20%28Walton%29">Portsmouth Point</a>", dedicated to Sassoon and inspired by the well-known painting of the same name by <a href="Thomas%20Rowlandson">Thomas Rowlandson</a>. It was first heard as an entr'acte at a performance in <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Diaghilev's</a> 1926 ballet season, where "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" complained, "It is a little difficult to make much of new music when it is heard through the hum of conversation." <a href="Henry%20J.%20Wood">Sir Henry Wood</a> programmed the work at <a href="the%20Proms">the Proms</a> the following year, where it made more of an impression. The composer conducted this performance; he did not enjoy conducting, but he had firm views on how his works should be interpreted, and orchestral players appreciated his "easy nonchalance" and "complete absence of fuss." Walton's other works of the 1920s included a short orchestral piece, "Siesta" (1926) and a <a href="Sinfonia%20Concertante">Sinfonia Concertante</a> for piano and orchestra (1928), which was well received at its premiere at a <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a> concert, but has not entered the regular repertory.

The <a href="Viola%20Concerto%20%28Walton%29">Viola Concerto</a> (1929) brought Walton to the forefront of British classical music. It was written at the suggestion of <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Sir Thomas Beecham</a> for the viola virtuoso <a href="Lionel%20Tertis">Lionel Tertis</a>. When Tertis received the manuscript, he rejected it immediately. The composer and violist <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Paul Hindemith</a> stepped into the breach and gave the first performance. The work was greeted with enthusiasm. In "The Manchester Guardian", <a href="Eric%20Blom">Eric Blom</a> wrote, "This young composer is a born genius" and said that it was tempting to call the concerto the best thing in recent music of any nationality. Tertis soon changed his mind and took the work up. A performance by him at a <a href="Three%20Choirs%20Festival">Three Choirs Festival</a> concert in <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a> in 1932 was the only occasion on which Walton met <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a>, whom he greatly admired. Elgar did not share the general enthusiasm for Walton's concerto.

Walton's next major composition was the massive choral <a href="cantata">cantata</a> "<a href="Belshazzar%27s%20Feast%20%28Walton%29">Belshazzar's Feast</a>" (1931). It began as a work on a modest scale; the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> commissioned a piece for small chorus, orchestra of no more than fifteen players, and soloist. Osbert Sitwell constructed a text, selecting verses from several books of the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> and the <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>. As Walton worked on it, he found that his music required far larger forces than the BBC proposed to allow, and Beecham rescued him by programming the work for the 1931 <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> Festival, to be conducted by <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a>. Walton later recalled Beecham as saying, "As you'll never hear the work again, my boy, why not throw in a couple of brass bands?" During early rehearsals, the Leeds chorus members found Walton's music difficult to master, and it was falsely rumoured in London musical circles that Beecham had been obliged to send Sargent to Leeds to quell a revolt. The first performance was a triumph for the composer, conductor and performers. A contemporary critic wrote, "Those who experienced the tremendous impact of its first performance had full justification for feeling that a great composer had arisen in our land, a composer to whose potentialities it was impossible to set any limits." The work has remained a staple of the choral repertoire.

In the 1930s, Walton's relationship with the Sitwells became less close. He had love affairs and new friendships that drew him out of their orbit. His first long affair was with Imma von Doernberg, the young widow of a German baron. She and Walton met in the late 1920s and they were together until 1934, when she left him. His later affair with Alice, <a href="Ivor%20Guest%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Wimborne%23Family">Viscountess Wimborne</a> (born 1880), which lasted from 1934 until her death in April 1948, caused a wider breach between Walton and the Sitwells, as she disliked them as much as they disliked her. By the 1930s, Walton was earning enough from composing to allow him financial independence for the first time. A legacy from a musical benefactress in 1931 further enhanced his finances, and in 1934 he left the Sitwells' house and bought a house in <a href="Belgravia">Belgravia</a>.

Walton's first major composition after "Belshazzar's Feast" was his <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Walton%29">First Symphony</a>. It was not written to a commission, and Walton worked slowly on the score from late 1931 until he completed it in 1935. He had composed the first three of the four movements by the end of 1933 and promised the premiere to the conductor <a href="Hamilton%20Harty">Hamilton Harty</a>. Walton then found himself unable to complete the work. The end of his affair with Imma von Doernberg coincided with, and may have contributed to, a sudden and persistent <a href="writer%27s%20block">writer's block</a>. Harty persuaded Walton to let him perform the three existing movements, which he premiered in December 1934 with the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>. During 1934 Walton interrupted work on the symphony to compose his first film music, for <a href="Paul%20Czinner">Paul Czinner</a>'s "<a href="Escape%20Me%20Never%20%281935%20film%29">Escape Me Never</a>" (1934), for which he was paid £300.

After a break of eight months, Walton resumed work on the symphony and completed it in 1935. Harty and the <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> gave the premiere of the completed piece in November of that year. The symphony aroused international interest. The leading continental conductors <a href="Wilhelm%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler">Wilhelm Furtwängler</a> and <a href="Willem%20Mengelberg">Willem Mengelberg</a> sent for copies of the score, the <a href="Chicago%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Chicago Symphony Orchestra</a> premiered the work in the US under Harty, <a href="Eugene%20Ormandy">Eugene Ormandy</a> and the <a href="Philadelphia%20Orchestra">Philadelphia Orchestra</a> gave the New York premiere, and the young <a href="George%20Szell">George Szell</a> conducted the symphony in Australia.
Elgar having died in 1934, the authorities turned to Walton to compose a march in the Elgarian tradition for the <a href="coronation%20of%20King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth">coronation of George VI</a> in 1937. His "<a href="Crown%20Imperial%20%28march%29">Crown Imperial</a>" was an immediate success with the public, but disappointed those of Walton's admirers who thought of him as an avant garde composer. Among Walton's other works from this decade are more film scores, including the first of his <a href="incidental%20music">incidental music</a> for Shakespeare adaptations, "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It%20%281936%20film%29">As You Like It</a>" (1936); a short ballet for a West End revue (1936); and a choral piece, "In Honour of the City of London" (1937). His most important work of the 1930s, alongside the symphony, was the <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Walton%29">Violin Concerto</a> (1939), commissioned by <a href="Jascha%20Heifetz">Jascha Heifetz</a>. The concerto, Walton later revealed, expressed his love for Alice Wimborne. Its strong <a href="Romantic%20music">romantic</a> style caused some critics to label it retrogressive, and Walton said in a newspaper interview, "Today's white hope is tomorrow's black sheep. These days it is very sad for a composer to grow old ... I seriously advise all sensitive composers to die at the age of 37. I know: I've gone through the first halcyon period and am just about ripe for my critical damnation."

In the late 1930s Walton became aware of a younger English composer whose fame was shortly to overtake his, <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>. After their first meeting, Britten wrote in his diary, "[...] to lunch with William Walton at <a href="Sloane%20Square">Sloane Square</a>. He is charming, but I feel always the school relationship with him – he is so obviously the head prefect of English music, whereas I'm the promising new boy." They remained on friendly terms for the rest of Britten's life; Walton admired many of Britten's works, and considered him a genius; Britten did not admire all of Walton's works but was grateful for his support at difficult times in his life.

During the Second World War Walton was exempted from military service on the understanding that he would compose music for wartime propaganda films. In addition to driving ambulances (extremely badly, he said), he was attached to the Army Film Unit as music adviser. He wrote scores for six films during the war – some that he thought "rather boring" and some that have become classics such as "<a href="The%20First%20of%20the%20Few">The First of the Few</a>" (1942) and <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>'s adaptation of Shakespeare's "<a href="Henry%20V%20%281944%20film%29">Henry V</a>" (1944).

Walton was at first dismissive of his film scores, regarding them as professional but of no intrinsic worth; he resisted attempts to arrange them into concert suites, saying, "Film music is not good film music if it can be used for any other purpose." He later relented to the extent of allowing concert suites to be arranged from "The First of the Few" and the Olivier Shakespeare films. For the BBC, Walton composed the music for a large-scale radio drama about <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>, written by <a href="Louis%20MacNeice">Louis MacNeice</a> and starring Olivier. As with his film music, the composer was inclined to dismiss the musical importance of his work on the programme.

Apart from these commissions, Walton's wartime works of any magnitude comprised incidental music for <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a>'s 1942 production of "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>"; two scores for the <a href="Royal%20Ballet">Sadler's Wells Ballet</a>, "<a href="The%20Wise%20Virgins">The Wise Virgins</a>", based on the music of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">J. S. Bach</a> transcribed by Walton, and "The Quest", with a plot loosely based on <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Spenser's</a> "<a href="The%20Faerie%20Queene">The Faerie Queene</a>"; and, for the concert hall, a suite of orchestral miniatures, "Music for Children", and a comedy overture, "Scapino", composed for the fiftieth anniversary of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

Walton's house in London was destroyed by German bombing in May 1941, after which he spent much of his time at Alice Wimborne's family house at <a href="Ashby%20St%20Ledgers">Ashby St Ledgers</a> in the countryside of <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a> in the middle of England. While there, Walton worked on projects that had been in his mind for some time. In 1939 he had been planning a substantial chamber work, a string quartet, but he set it aside while composing his wartime film scores. In early 1945 he turned again to the quartet. Walton was conscious that Britten, with "<a href="Les%20Illuminations">Les Illuminations</a>" (1940), the "<a href="Sinfonia%20da%20Requiem">Sinfonia da Requiem</a>" (1942), and "<a href="Peter%20Grimes">Peter Grimes</a>" in 1945, had produced a series of substantial works, while Walton had produced no major composition since the Violin Concerto in 1939. Among English critics and audiences, the Violin Concerto was not at first rated one of Walton's finest works. Because Heifetz had bought the exclusive rights to play the concerto for two years, it was not heard in Britain until 1941. The London premiere, with a less famous soloist, and in the unflattering acoustics of the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>, did not immediately reveal the work as a masterpiece. The String Quartet in A minor, premiered in May 1947, was Walton's most substantial work of the 1940s. Kennedy calls it one of his finest achievements and "a sure sign that he had thrown off the trammels of his cinema style and rediscovered his true voice."

In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Chaucer</a>'s "<a href="Troilus%20and%20Criseyde">Troilus and Criseyde</a>", but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> later that year.

Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of "<a href="Hamlet%20%281948%20film%29">Hamlet</a>" (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera "<a href="Troilus%20and%20Cressida%20%28opera%29">Troilus and Cressida</a>". On the advice of the BBC, he invited <a href="Christopher%20Hassall">Christopher Hassall</a> to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was <a href="knight">knight</a>ed. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of "Façade", which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> he was again called on to write a coronation march, "<a href="Orb%20and%20Sceptre">Orb and Sceptre</a>"; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the "<a href="Te%20Deum">Te Deum</a>" for the occasion.

"Troilus and Cressida" was presented at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did <a href="Henry%20Moore">Henry Moore</a> who had agreed to design the production; <a href="Elisabeth%20Schwarzkopf">Elisabeth Schwarzkopf</a>, for whom the role of Cressida had been written, refused to perform it; her replacement, <a href="Magda%20L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3">Magda László</a>, had difficulty mastering the English words; and Sargent, the conductor, "did not seem well acquainted with the score". The premiere had a friendly reception, but there was a general feeling that Hassall and Walton had written an old-fashioned opera in an outmoded tradition. The piece was subsequently staged in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> and <a href="Milan">Milan</a> during the next year, but failed to make a positive impression, and did not enter the regular operatic repertory.
In 1956 Walton sold his London house and took up full-time residence on Ischia. He built a hilltop house at <a href="Forio">Forio</a> and called it <a href="La%20Mortella">La Mortella</a>. Susana Walton created a magnificent garden there. Walton's other works of the 1950s include the music for a fourth Shakespeare film, Olivier's "<a href="Richard%20III%20%281955%20film%29">Richard III</a>", and the <a href="Cello%20Concerto%20%28Walton%29">Cello Concerto</a> (1956), written for <a href="Gregor%20Piatigorsky">Gregor Piatigorsky</a>, who gave the premiere in January 1957 with the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> and the conductor <a href="Charles%20Munch%20%28conductor%29">Charles Munch</a>. Some critics felt that the concerto was old-fashioned; <a href="Peter%20Heyworth">Peter Heyworth</a> wrote that there was little in the work that would have startled an audience in the year the met its iceberg (1912). It has nevertheless entered the regular repertoire, performed by <a href="Paul%20Tortelier">Paul Tortelier</a>, <a href="Yo-Yo%20Ma">Yo-Yo Ma</a>, <a href="Lynn%20Harrell">Lynn Harrell</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Fournier">Pierre Fournier</a> among others.
In 1966 Walton successfully underwent surgery for <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>. Until then he had been an inveterate pipe-smoker, but after the operation he never smoked again. While he was convalescing, he worked on a one-act comic opera, "<a href="The%20Bear%20%28opera%29">The Bear</a>", which was premiered at Britten's <a href="Aldeburgh%20Festival">Aldeburgh Festival</a>, in June 1966, and enthusiastically received. Walton had become so used to being written off by music critics that he felt "there must be something wrong when the worms turned on some praise." Walton received the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> in 1967, the fourth composer to be so honoured, after Elgar, <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Vaughan Williams</a> and Britten.

Walton's orchestral works of the 1960s include his <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Walton%29">Second Symphony</a> (1960), "Variations on a Theme by Hindemith" (1963), "<a href="Capriccio%20burlesco">Capriccio burlesco</a>" (1968), and "<a href="Improvisations%20on%20an%20Impromptu%20of%20Benjamin%20Britten">Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten</a>" (1969). His <a href="song%20cycle">song cycle</a>s from this period were composed for <a href="Peter%20Pears">Peter Pears</a> ("Anon. in Love", 1960) and Schwarzkopf ("A Song for the Lord Mayor's Table", 1962). He was commissioned to compose a score for the 1969 film "<a href="Battle%20of%20Britain%20%28film%29%23Musical%20score">Battle of Britain</a>", but the film company rejected most of his score, replacing it with music by <a href="Ron%20Goodwin">Ron Goodwin</a>. A concert suite of Walton's score was published and recorded after Walton's death. After his experience over "Battle of Britain", Walton declared that he would write no more film music, but he was persuaded by Olivier to compose the score for a film of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov</a>'s "<a href="Three%20Sisters%20%281970%20Olivier%20film%29">Three Sisters</a>" in 1969.

Walton was never a facile or quick composer, and in his final decade, he found composition increasingly difficult. He repeatedly tried to compose a third symphony for <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Previn">André Previn</a>, but eventually abandoned it. Many of his final works are re-orchestrations or revisions of earlier music. He orchestrated his song cycle "Anon. in Love" (originally for tenor and guitar), and at the request of <a href="Neville%20Marriner">Neville Marriner</a> adapted his A minor String Quartet as a Sonata for Strings. One original work from this period was his "Jubilate Deo", premiered as one of several events to celebrate his seventieth birthday. The British prime minister, <a href="Edward%20Heath">Edward Heath</a>, gave a birthday dinner for Walton at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a>, attended by royalty and Walton's most eminent colleagues; Britten presented a Walton evening at <a href="Aldeburgh">Aldeburgh</a> and Previn conducted an all-Walton concert at the <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a>.

Walton revised the score of "Troilus and Cressida", and the opera was staged at Covent Garden in 1976. Once again it was plagued by misfortune while in preparation. Walton was in poor health; Previn, who was to conduct, also fell ill; and the tenor chosen for Troilus pulled out. As in 1954, the critics were generally tepid. Some of Walton's final artistic endeavours were in collaboration with the film-maker <a href="Tony%20Palmer">Tony Palmer</a>. Walton took part in Palmer's profile of him, "At the Haunted End of the Day", in 1981, and in 1982 Walton and his wife played the cameo roles of King <a href="Frederick%20Augustus%20II%20of%20Saxony">Frederick Augustus</a> and Queen Maria of Saxony in Palmer's nine-hour film "<a href="Wagner%20%28mini-series%29">Wagner</a>".

Walton died at La Mortella on 8 March 1983, at the age of 80. His ashes were buried on Ischia, and a memorial service was held at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, where a commemorative stone to Walton was unveiled near those to Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten.

In 1944, it was said of Walton that he summed up the recent past of English music and augured its future. Later writers have concluded that Walton had little influence on the next generation of composers. In his later years, Walton formed friendships with younger composers including <a href="Hans%20Werner%20Henze">Hans Werner Henze</a> and <a href="Malcolm%20Arnold">Malcolm Arnold</a>, but although he admired their work, he did not influence their compositional styles. Throughout his life, Walton held no posts at music conservatoires; he had no pupils, gave no lectures and wrote no essays. After his death, the Walton Trust, inspired by Susana Walton, has run arts education projects, promoted British music and held annual summer masterclasses on Ischia for gifted young musicians.

Walton was a slow worker. Both during composition and afterwards he would continually revise his music; he said, "Without an india-rubber I was absolutely sunk." Consequently, his total body of work from his sixty-year career as a composer is not large. Between the first performance of "Façade" in 1923, for example, and that of the Sinfonia Concertante in 1928, he averaged only one small piece a year. Of his work as a whole, <a href="Byron%20Adams">Byron Adams</a> in "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>" writes:

The writer adds that Walton's allegiance to his basic style never wavered and that this loyalty to his own vision, together with his rhythmic vitality, sensuous melancholy, sly charm and orchestral flair, gives Walton's finest music "an imperishable glamour". Another biographer of Walton, Neil Tierney, writes that although contemporary critics felt that the post-war music did not match Walton's pre-war compositions, it has become clear that the later works are "if emotionally less direct, more profound."

Walton's first work for full orchestra, "Portsmouth Point" (1925), inspired by a Rowlandson print of the same name, depicts a rumbustious dockside scene (in Kennedy's phrase, "the sailors of <a href="H.M.S.%20Pinafore">H.M.S. Pinafore</a> have had a night on the tiles") in a fast moving score full of <a href="syncopation">syncopation</a> and <a href="Cross-beat">cross-rhythm</a> that for years proved hazardous for conductors and orchestras alike. Throughout his career, Walton wrote works in this pattern, such as the lively Comedy Overture "Scapino", a virtuoso piece commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, described by "The Musical Times" as "an ingenious blending of fragments in exhilarating profusion." Walton's post-war works in this genre are the "Johannesburg Festival Overture" (1956), the "diverting but hard-edged "Capriccio burlesco"" (1968), and the longer "Partita" (1957), written for the <a href="Cleveland%20Orchestra">Cleveland Orchestra</a>, described by "Grove" as "an impressively concentrated score with a high-spirited finale [with] steely counterpoint and orchestral virtuosity". Walton's shorter pieces also include two tributes to musical colleagues, "Variations on a Theme by Hindemith" (1963) and the "Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten" (1969), in both of which the source material is gradually transformed as Walton's own voice becomes more prominent. The critic Hugh Ottaway commented that in both pieces "the interaction of two musical personalities is... fascinating".

Walton's first successful large-scale concert work, the Viola Concerto (1929) is in marked contrast to the raucous "Portsmouth Point"; despite the common influence of jazz and of the music of Hindemith and Ravel, in its structure and romantic longing it owes much to the Elgar <a href="Cello%20Concerto%20%28Elgar%29">Cello Concerto</a>. In this work, wrote <a href="Edward%20Sackville-West%2C%205th%20Baron%20Sackville">Edward Sackville-West</a> and <a href="Desmond%20Shawe-Taylor%20%28music%20critic%29">Desmond Shawe-Taylor</a> in "<a href="The%20Record%20Guide">The Record Guide</a>", "the lyric poet in Walton, who had so far been hidden under a mask of irony, fully emerged." Walton followed this pattern in his two subsequent concertos, for Violin (1937) and for Cello (1956). Each opens reflectively, is in three movements, and contrasts agitated and jagged passages with warmer romantic sections. The Cello Concerto is more introspective than the two earlier concertos, with a ticking rhythm throughout the work suggesting the inexorable passage of time.

The two symphonies are strongly contrasted with one another. The First is on a large scale, reminiscent at times of Sibelius. Grove says of the work that its "orgiastic power, coruscating malice, sensuous desolation and extroverted swagger" make the symphony a tribute to Walton's tenacity and inventive facility. Critics have always differed on whether the finale lives up to the rest of the work. In comparison with the First, the Second Symphony struck many reviewers as lightweight, and, as with many of Walton's works of the 1950s, it was regarded as old fashioned. It is a very different kind of work from the First Symphony. David Cox describes it as "more a "<a href="divertimento">divertimento</a>" than a symphony ... highly personal, unmistakably Walton throughout", and Kennedy calls it "somewhat enigmatic in mood, and a superb example of Walton's more mature, concise, and mellow post-1945 style."

Although generally a slow and perfectionist composer, Walton was capable of working quickly when necessary. Some of his stage and screen music was written to tight deadlines. He regarded his ballet and incidental music as of less importance than his concert works and was generally dismissive of what he produced.

Of his ballets for Sadler's Wells, "The Wise Virgins" (1940) is an arrangement of eight extracts from choral and instrumental music by Bach. "The Quest" (1943), written in great haste, is, according to Grove, oddly reminiscent of Vaughan Williams. Neither of these works established itself in the regular repertoire, unlike the ballet score Walton arranged from the music of "Façade", the music for which was expanded for full orchestra, still retaining the jazz influences and the iconoclastic wit of the original. Music from "The Quest" and the whole of the Viola Concerto were used for another Sadler's Wells ballet, "O.W.", in 1972.

Walton wrote little incidental music for the theatre, his music for "Macbeth" (1942) being one of his most notable contributions to the genre.

Between 1934 and 1969 he wrote the music for 13 films. He arranged the "Spitfire Prelude and Fugue" from his own score for "The First of the Few" (1942). He allowed suites to be arranged from his Shakespeare filmscores of the 1940s and 1950s; in these films, he mixed Elizabethan pastiche with wholly characteristic Waltonian music. Kennedy singles out for praise the <a href="Battle%20of%20Agincourt">Agincourt</a> battle sequence in "Henry V", where the music makes the charge of the French knights "fearsomely real." Despite Walton's view that film music is ineffective when performed out of context, suites from several more of his filmscores have been assembled since his death.

Walton worked for many years on his only full-length opera, "<a href="Troilus%20and%20Cressida%20%28opera%29">Troilus and Cressida</a>", both before its premiere and afterwards. It has never been regarded as a success. The libretto is generally considered weak, and Walton's music, despite many passages that have won critical praise, is not dramatic enough to sustain interest. Grove calls the work a partially successful attempt to revivify the traditions of nineteenth-century Italian opera in a post-war era wary of heroic Romanticism.

Walton's only other opera, "<a href="The%20Bear%20%28opera%29">The Bear</a>", based on a comic vaudeville by <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov</a>, is judged by critics as much more successful. It is, however, a one-act piece, a genre not regularly staged at most opera houses, and so is infrequently seen. <a href="Operabase">Operabase</a> records four productions of the piece worldwide between 2013 and 2015.

Apart from an early experiment in <a href="atonal">atonal</a>ism in his String Quartet (1919–22), which he later described as "full of undigested <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Bartók</a> and Schoenberg", Walton's major essays in chamber music are his String Quartet in A Minor (1945–46) and the Sonata for Violin and Piano (1947–49). In the opinion of Adams in "Grove's Dictionary", the quartet is one of Walton's supreme achievements. Earlier critics did not always share this view. In 1956 "The Record Guide" said, "[T]he material is not first class and the composition as a whole seems laboured."

The work exists also in its later expanded form as the Sonata for Strings (1971), which, the critic Trevor Harvey wrote, combines Walton in his most energetically rhythmic mood with a "vein of lyrical tenderness which is equally characteristic and is so rewarding to listen to". The Violin Sonata is in two closely related movements, with strong thematic material in common. The first movement is nostalgically lyrical, the second a set of variations, each one a <a href="semitone">semitone</a> higher than its predecessor. Walton briefly refers back to Schoenberg with a <a href="Twelve-tone%20technique">dodecaphonic</a> passage in the second movement, but otherwise the sonata is firmly <a href="Diatonic%20scale">tonal</a>.

Walton's liturgical compositions include the "Coronation Te Deum" (1952), "Missa brevis" (1966), "Jubilate Deo" (1972), and "Magnificat" and "Nunc dimittis" (1974), and the anthems "A Litany" (1916) and "Set me as a seal upon thy heart" (1938).

One of the best-known and most frequently performed of Walton's works is the cantata "Belshazzar's Feast". Written for large orchestra, chorus and baritone soloist, it intersperses a choral and orchestral depiction of Babylonian excess and depravity, barbaric jazzy outbursts, and the lamentations and finally the rejoicing of the Jewish captives. The "couple of brass bands" added at Beecham's suggestion to an already large orchestra each consist of three trumpets, three trombones and a tuba. Many critics judged it the most important English choral work since Elgar's "<a href="The%20Dream%20of%20Gerontius">The Dream of Gerontius</a>" in 1900. None of Walton's later choral works have matched its popularity. They include "In Honour of the City of London" (1937) and a "Gloria" (1960–61) composed for the 125th anniversary of the <a href="Huddersfield%20Choral%20Society">Huddersfield Choral Society</a>.

From the days of 78 rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a> company recorded eleven movements from "Façade", with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague <a href="Constant%20Lambert">Constant Lambert</a>. In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with <a href="Frederick%20Riddle">Frederick Riddle</a> and the LSO conducted by the composer. In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, <a href="EMI">EMI</a>. The EMI producer <a href="Walter%20Legge">Walter Legge</a> arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.

Walton himself, although a reluctant conductor, conducted many of the EMI recordings, and some for other labels. He made studio recordings of the First Symphony, the Viola Concerto, the Violin Concerto, the Sinfonia Concertante, the "Façade" Suites, the Partita, "Belshazzar's Feast", and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and "The First of the Few". Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc, including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum.

Almost all Walton's works have been recorded for commercial release. EMI published a "Walton Edition" of his major works on CD in the 1990s, and the recording of the <a href="Chandos%20Records">Chandos Records</a> "Walton Edition" of his works was completed in 2010. His best-known works have been recorded by performers from many countries. Among the frequently recorded are "Belshazzar's Feast", the Viola and Violin Concertos and the First Symphony, which has had more than twenty recordings since Harty's 1936 set.

Warren County, Indiana

Warren County lies in western <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> between the <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> state line and the <a href="Wabash%20River">Wabash River</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. According to the 2010 census, the population was 8,508. The <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> is <a href="Williamsport%2C%20Indiana">Williamsport</a>.

Before the arrival of non-<a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous</a> settlers in the early 19th century, the area was inhabited by several <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> tribes. The <a href="County%20%28United%20States%29">county</a> was officially established in 1827 and was the 55th county to be formed in Indiana.

It is one of the most rural counties in the state, with the third-smallest population and the lowest population density at about . The county has four <a href="municipal%20corporation">incorporated</a> towns with a total population of about 3,100, as well as many small unincorporated communities. The county is divided into 12 <a href="civil%20township">townships</a> which provide local services.

Much of the land in the county is given over to agriculture, especially on the open <a href="prairie">prairie</a> in the northern and western parts; the county's farmland is among the most productive in the state. Nearer the river along the southeastern border, the land has many hills, valleys, and tributary streams and is more heavily wooded. Agriculture, manufacturing, government, education, and health care each provide substantial portions of the jobs in the county. Four Indiana state roads cross the county, as do two U.S. Routes and one major railroad line.

In the centuries before the arrival of European settlers, the area that became Warren County was on the boundary between the <a href="Miami%20people">Miami</a> and <a href="Kickapoo%20people">Kickapoo</a> tribes. By the late 18th century, many Miami had moved further south; most of Indiana north of the Wabash was then occupied by the <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a> people. The first non-indigenous settler in the area was probably <a href="Zachariah%20Cicott">Zachariah Cicott</a>, a French-Canadian who first traded with the Kickapoo and Potawatomi people around 1802. When General <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> took an army from <a href="Vincennes%2C%20Indiana">Vincennes</a> to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tippecanoe">Battle of Tippecanoe</a> in late 1811, Cicott served as a scout; the trail taken by Harrison's army passed through the area that later became Warren County on its way to and from the battle site in <a href="Tippecanoe%20County%2C%20Indiana">Tippecanoe County</a>. Following the War of 1812, Cicott resumed his trading on the Wabash; the state of Indiana was established in 1816, and Cicott built a log house in 1817 at the location where he later founded the town of <a href="Independence%2C%20Indiana">Independence</a>. Other settlers came to the area, but probably not until around 1822.

The county was established on March 1, 1827, by the Indiana General Assembly. It was named for Dr. <a href="Joseph%20Warren">Joseph Warren</a>, who was killed in 1775 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">Battle of Bunker Hill</a>, in which he fought as a private because his commission as a general had not yet taken effect. The short-lived town of <a href="Warrenton%2C%20Indiana">Warrenton</a> was the original Warren County seat, chosen by commissioners in March 1828; the next year an act was passed calling for the seat to be relocated, and in June 1829 it was moved to Williamsport.

The first county courthouse was a log house in Warrenton that belonged to (and was occupied by) Enoch Farmer, one of the county's earliest settlers. When the county seat moved to Williamsport, a log house belonging to the town's founder, William Harrison, served this purpose for several years. The first purpose-built courthouse was completed in 1835 at a cost of $2,000; in 1872, it was replaced with a new building that cost $48,000. The third courthouse was built in 1886, in a new section of town that grew around the newly constructed railroad. That building burned in 1907, and the fourth and current <a href="Warren%20County%20Courthouse%20%28Indiana%29">Warren County courthouse</a> was completed on the same site in 1908 at a cost of $115,000.

As the 19th century progressed, the United States government's <a href="Indian%20removal">Indian removal</a> policy pushed Native American tribes west of the Mississippi River. In 1830, the <a href="Indian%20Removal%20Act">Indian Removal Act</a> was signed into law, and though that act did not directly address the Potawatomi people of Indiana, it led to several additional treaties that resulted in their removal. In what came to be known as the <a href="Potawatomi%20Trail%20of%20Death">Potawatomi Trail of Death</a>, about 860 Potawatomi Indians who had refused to leave were forced to move from Indiana to Kansas. On September 14, 1838, the group camped near Williamsport, and on September 15 they camped in the southwestern part of the county before moving into Illinois. Before reaching their destination in Kansas, over 40 of them had died, many of them children; two children died and were buried at the second Warren County campsite.

When the county was established, the <a href="Wabash%20River">Wabash River</a> was vital to transportation and shipping. Zachariah Cicott traded up and down the river, and cities like <a href="Attica%2C%20Indiana">Attica</a>, <a href="Perrysville%2C%20Indiana">Perrysville</a>, <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Indiana">Baltimore</a> and Williamsport were founded near the river's banks and flourished because of it. In the 1840s, the <a href="Wabash%20and%20Erie%20Canal">Wabash and Erie Canal</a> began to operate and provided even broader shipping opportunities, but the canal favored towns which were on the "right side" of the river; the canal was on the <a href="Fountain%20County%2C%20Indiana">Fountain County</a> side, and towns like Baltimore dwindled as a result. Some towns, such as Williamsport and Perrysville, managed to participate in canal traffic through the use of side-cuts that brought traffic from the canal across the river. When railroads were constructed starting in the 1850s, they in turn began to render the canals obsolete and allowed trade to reach towns that lacked water connections. The canal continued to be used through the early 1870s.
The first trains to run in Warren County operated on portions of the Toledo, Wabash and Western Railway (later the <a href="Wabash%20Railroad">Wabash Railroad</a>) in 1856. The railroad entered the county near Williamsport and was built westward, reaching the western border at State Line City by 1857. West Lebanon was the only other settlement near the railroad's path, but the line bypassed it by about a mile; the town subsequently moved northward to be nearer the station. In 1869 the <a href="Indianapolis%2C%20Bloomington%20and%20Western%20Railway">Indianapolis, Bloomington and Western Railway</a> was built across Mound Township in the southern part of the county. A few years later, in 1872, a branch of the <a href="Chicago%2C%20Danville%20and%20Vincennes%20Railroad">Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad</a> (known as the "<a href="Pumpkin%20Vine%20Railroad">Pumpkin Vine Railroad</a>") was built from <a href="Bismarck%2C%20Illinois">Bismarck, Illinois</a>, southeast through Warren County; it was built specifically to carry coal from the mines south of <a href="Covington%2C%20Indiana">Covington</a>. A labor riot at the mines in the late 1870s interrupted the flow of coal, and this combined with the poor financial state of the railroad led to the removal of most of the track by 1880; the remaining portion was removed a few years later. At about this time, in the early 1880s, the Chicago and Indiana Coal Railroad began operating a north–south line through the county. It became part of the <a href="Chicago%20and%20Eastern%20Illinois%20Railroad">Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad</a> but was abandoned in 1920 due to financial difficulties; a new company operated the line as the <a href="Chicago%2C%20Attica%20and%20Southern%20Railroad">Chicago, Attica and Southern Railroad</a> starting in 1921, but financial problems affected the new company as well and the rails were removed in 1946. Another line, part of the <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a>, was built through the area in 1903; locally, it ran northeast from Danville into Warren County, then turned north through the small towns of Sloan and Stewart and continued north into Benton County. In the 1970s it became part of <a href="Penn%20Central%20Transportation%20Company">Penn Central</a>, then <a href="Consolidated%20Rail%20Corporation">Conrail</a>; operations on the line ceased in the 1990s and the tracks were removed, though a portion running north from Stewart remained and became the <a href="Bee%20Line%20Railroad">Bee Line Railroad</a> which serves the grain processing facility in Stewart.

The Wabash Cannonball was a passenger train that ran on the Wabash Railroad between Detroit, Michigan and Saint Louis, Missouri, starting in 1949. On September 19, 1964, the southbound Cannonball struck a truck loaded with concrete blocks at a crossing in Johnsonville. The driver of the truck was killed instantly, but although the train derailed, no other lives were lost. On the train, the driver and fireman were severely injured when the engine caught fire, and about half of the 50 passengers were injured. Over of track was torn out, and the damage was estimated at over $500,000. The last run of the Cannonball was in 1969.

After peaking in the late 19th century, the county's population declined during the 20th, in common with much of the rural Midwest. The widespread adoption of the automobile in the 1920s undercut small-town businesses, which were threatened further by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s. World War II and the economic revival of the late 1940s and 1950s drew people to better jobs in growing regional cities, and this further diminished small towns. The population shrank again in the 1980s due largely to the effects of the "farm crisis" of low crop prices, high farmer debt and other economic causes.

The first <a href="county%20fair">county fair</a> involved both Fountain and Warren counties and was held in Independence on September 6 and 7, 1853. In following years, the fair was held in Fountain County, and participation by Warren County farmers diminished. In 1856, farmers in the northern part of the county held a fair just east of Pine Village, and this continued each year through 1864. West Lebanon became the next site of the county fair, and it ran successfully through 1883; the fairgrounds just to the northwest of town were well-developed. Later, the fair was held at the county seat of Williamsport, and this continues through the present day; it is now a <a href="4H">4H</a> fair.

One location in the county, near the small town of <a href="Kramer%2C%20Indiana">Kramer</a>, once had an international reputation: the <a href="Hotel%20Mudlavia">Hotel Mudlavia</a>. Built in 1890 at a cost of $250,000, it drew guests from around the world to nearby natural springs that were said to have healing qualities. People such as <a href="James%20Whitcomb%20Riley">James Whitcomb Riley</a>, <a href="John%20L.%20Sullivan">John L. Sullivan</a> and <a href="Harry%20Lauder">Harry Lauder</a> are known to have stayed at the hotel, which burned down in 1920. Later, water from the springs was bottled and sold by Indianapolis-based Cameron Springs company, which was acquired by the <a href="Perrier">Perrier Group of America</a> in 2000 for about $10.5 million. the water was still being sold and was marketed under a variety of names.

The Wabash River, coming out of <a href="Tippecanoe%20County%2C%20Indiana">Tippecanoe County</a> to the east, defines the southeastern border of the county; the terrain here is hilly and wooded areas are common. Fountain County lies across the river. By contrast, the northwest region consists mainly of flat prairie farmland; this continues in <a href="Benton%20County%2C%20Indiana">Benton County</a> to the north. Along the western side of the county is the border with <a href="Vermilion%20County%2C%20Illinois">Vermilion County</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>. The small southern border is shared with the north end of the similarly named Indiana county of <a href="Vermillion%20County%2C%20Indiana">Vermillion</a>. The state capital of <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> lies about to the southeast.

The highest free-falling waterfall in the state, <a href="Williamsport%20Falls">Williamsport Falls</a>, is located in downtown Williamsport; a stream named Fall Creek flows through the town and falls over a sandstone ledge less than from the county courthouse. Northeast of Independence is the Black Rock Barrens Nature Preserve, a rare <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a> glade area that, with the adjacent Weiler-Leopold Nature Reserve, supports a diversity of flora including <a href="Trillium%20sessile">sessile trillium</a>, <a href="phlox">phlox</a> and <a href="Camassia">wild hyacinth</a> in the moist lowlands and <a href="Amelanchier">serviceberry</a>, <a href="Thalictrum%20thalictroides">rue anemone</a>, <a href="Viola%20pedata">birdsfoot violet</a> and <a href="Taenidia%20integerrima">yellow pimpernel</a> on the drier slopes. <a href="Big%20Pine%20Creek%20%28Indiana%29">Big Pine Creek</a> is the county's largest waterway after the Wabash River, and segment of it is designated by the <a href="Indiana%20DNR">Indiana Department of Natural Resources</a> as a state natural and scenic river and passes near Fall Creek Gorge Nature Preserve, an area of cascades and <a href="Giant%27s%20kettle">potholes</a>.
According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 99.53%) is land and (or 0.47%) is water. Elevations in the county range from above sea level where the Wabash River enters Vermillion County to in northeastern Prairie Township. The landscape consists mostly of flat or gently sloping <a href="moraine">moraine</a> overlaying silty and loamy <a href="glacial%20till">glacial till</a>, except along the Wabash River where sand, gravel, sandstone and shale are exposed. Various forms of silt <a href="loam">loam</a> constitute most of the county's soil and are conducive to agriculture. Forests cover about 14% of the county, mainly around major waterways, and consist principally of deciduous hardwoods among which <a href="maple">maple</a>–<a href="beech">beech</a> and <a href="oak">oak</a>–<a href="hickory">hickory</a> forests are the most common. The only <a href="coal%20mine">coal mine</a>s in the county are located in the southeastern part of Steuben Township, near the Wabash River.

When the county was formed in 1827, it was divided into four <a href="Civil%20township">townships</a>: <a href="Medina%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Medina</a>, <a href="Warren%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Warren</a>, <a href="Pike%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Pike</a> and <a href="Mound%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Mound</a>. Over the following decades, many changes were made to the township borders and eight new townships were created. <a href="Pine%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Pine</a> and <a href="Washington%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Washington</a> were the first of these, in March 1830; <a href="Steuben%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Steuben</a> followed in 1834. <a href="Liberty%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Liberty</a> was formed in 1843, <a href="Adams%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Adams</a> in 1848, then <a href="Jordan%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Jordan</a> in 1850. <a href="Kent%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Kent</a> and <a href="Prairie%20Township%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Prairie</a> were the last to be created, in 1864. , Prairie Township, at , has the lowest population density; it covers more area than any of the other townships—nearly —and contains no incorporated towns. The highest density is in Washington Township, which has ; it includes Williamsport, the county's largest town, and covers only about .

There are four incorporated towns in the county. The largest is Williamsport, which is on the western banks of the Wabash River in the eastern part of the county, just downstream of Attica (which is on the east side of the river in Fountain County); in 2010, its population was 1,898—nearly one-fourth of the county's total. <a href="West%20Lebanon%2C%20Indiana">West Lebanon</a> is about west of Williamsport on State Road 28, with a population of 723. The town of <a href="Pine%20Village%2C%20Indiana">Pine Village</a> lies about to the north of Williamsport where State Road 55 intersects State Road 26, near the northern edge of the county; 217 people live in Pine Village. <a href="State%20Line%20City%2C%20Indiana">State Line City</a> is in the southwestern part of the county and shares its western border with the <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> state line. A small Illinois community named <a href="Illiana%2C%20Illinois">Illiana</a> lies immediately on the west side of the county road which runs along the state border (and which is also a street between the two communities). State Line City is the smallest of the towns, with a population of 143.
In addition to the incorporated towns, there are over a dozen small unincorporated communities in Warren County that are historical centers of activity. Now they consist mostly of dwellings, though several have churches and some still have small businesses. The small settlements of <a href="Hedrick%2C%20Indiana">Hedrick</a>, <a href="Pence%2C%20Indiana">Pence</a> and <a href="Stewart%2C%20Indiana">Stewart</a> are in Jordan Township; Stewart consists of a grain processing facility and a single residence. In Steuben Township, <a href="Johnsonville%2C%20Indiana">Johnsonville</a> has a church and a handful of residences. <a href="Marshfield%2C%20Indiana">Marshfield</a> has an automotive body repair shop, a <a href="grain%20elevator">grain elevator</a> and a church. <a href="Independence%2C%20Indiana">Independence</a>, platted in 1832, is located on the site of a trading post set up by Zachariah Cicott. He is buried in a cemetery in Warren Township, just north of town. The township included the small settlement of <a href="Winthrop%2C%20Indiana">Winthrop</a>. Liberty Township has three unincorporated communities: <a href="Carbondale%2C%20Indiana">Carbondale</a>, <a href="Judyville%2C%20Indiana">Judyville</a> and <a href="Kramer%2C%20Indiana">Kramer</a> (near the site of the Mudlavia Hotel). Several townships contain only a single settlement. <a href="Foster%2C%20Indiana">Foster</a> is the only one in Mound Township and has a motel and several houses. In the northeast corner of the county, <a href="Green%20Hill%2C%20Indiana">Green Hill</a> is Medina Township's only settlement. <a href="Tab%2C%20Indiana">Tab</a> is the only settlement in Prairie Township; most of this township is agricultural, and a large grain processing facility is Tab's only remaining business. Pine Township's only community is <a href="Rainsville%2C%20Indiana">Rainsville</a>.

Some settlements did not survive. The river town of <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Indiana">Baltimore</a> thrived and was a major center of trade until the river was overshadowed by the railroad for purposes of trade and transportation; a single house, built long after the town's heyday, is all that remains. Warrenton had a promising start as the first county seat, but it began to wane after the seat moved, and today no trace is left. <a href="Chesapeake%2C%20Indiana">Chesapeake</a> was the first settlement in Steuben Township, but it faded away so early that even an 1883 county history has little to say on the subject. <a href="Brisco%2C%20Indiana">Brisco</a> was never large, though it did have a school house from the 1850s through the 1920s. It likewise disappeared by the end of the 20th century. <a href="Chatterton%2C%20Indiana">Chatterton</a> had a school, a store and a post office, but it has disappeared even though the name continues to appear on maps. Other communities were planned but did not develop. <a href="Dresser%2C%20Indiana">Dresser</a> was never much more than a collection of houses, though it did have a post office for a few years around the turn of the 20th century. The settlements of <a href="Kickapoo%2C%20Indiana">Kickapoo</a>, <a href="Locust%20Grove%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Locust Grove</a>, <a href="Sloan%2C%20Indiana">Sloan</a> and <a href="Walnut%20Grove%2C%20Warren%20County%2C%20Indiana">Walnut Grove</a> were similar in this respect. <a href="Point%20Pleasant%2C%20Indiana">Point Pleasant</a> never developed much beyond the founder's residence and a liquor store, and was later described as a "paper town".

Warren County is in the <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">humid continental climate</a> region of the United States, as is most of Indiana. Its <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> is Dfa, meaning that it is cold, has no dry season, and has a hot summer. From 1971 to 2000, average temperatures in Indiana have ranged from a low of in January to a high of in July, although a record low of was recorded in 1887 and a record high of was recorded in 1936.

Warren County was affected by the <a href="Great%20Blizzard%20of%201978">Great Blizzard of 1978</a> which covered several states and was the worst blizzard on record for Indiana; in late January, a record of snowfall of over fell locally, and high winds resulted in snowdrifts as high as . Local schools were closed for up to seventeen days, and some residents were snowbound for as many as five days.

There are no interstate highways in Warren County, although <a href="Interstate%2074">Interstate 74</a> passes less than half a mile (800 m) from the southern border. About of <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways">federal highways</a> and of <a href="List%20of%20State%20Roads%20in%20Indiana">state highways</a> cross the county, as do about of <a href="County%20highway%23United%20States">county roads</a>. Of these, roughly a third are paved and the rest are topped with crushed gravel or packed dirt.

<a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Indiana">U.S. Route 41</a> enters from Benton County to the north and runs through the center of Warren County, veering to the east and crossing the Wabash River between Williamsport and Attica before continuing south. passes through the far southern part of the county on its route between Covington and <a href="Danville%2C%20Illinois">Danville, Illinois</a>.
In the northern part of the county, begins at the Illinois border and passes through the town of Pine Village, where it intersects on its way from <a href="Oxford%2C%20Indiana">Oxford</a> in the north to Attica in the south; State Road 26 continues east through <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Indiana">Lafayette</a> and on to the Ohio border.

The four-lane divided <a href="Indiana%20State%20Road%2063">State Road 63</a> runs south from its northern terminus at U.S. Route 41 near the center of the county; both reach <a href="Terre%20Haute%2C%20Indiana">Terre Haute</a> about to the south, but while Route 41 crosses to the east side of the river, State Road 63 remains on the west side. Construction on the current State Road 63, which replaced the older two-lane road and streamlined its route, began in the late 1960s and was completed by the early 1980s. The current two-lane is a part of the original route of State Road 63 and forms a business route that leaves its parent route, passes through West Lebanon and along the river, then rejoins its parent near the south edge of the county. A small portion of lies in the far northwestern corner of the county, following the county and state border north from State Road 26 for only about before leaving Warren County and entering Benton County on its way through the small town of <a href="Ambia%2C%20Indiana">Ambia</a>.

A <a href="Norfolk%20Southern%20Railway">Norfolk Southern Railway</a> route connecting Danville, Illinois, with the city of <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Indiana">Lafayette</a> is the county's busiest rail line, carrying about 45 freight trains each day. It enters Warren County at State Line City and passes northeast through the communities of Johnsonville, Marshfield, West Lebanon and Williamsport before exiting the county at Attica. Two <a href="short-line%20railroad">short-line railroad</a>s operate less frequently. The <a href="Bee%20Line%20Railroad">Bee Line Railroad</a> is used principally for agricultural transportation and runs approximately from Stewart north through Tab and into southern Benton County where it joins the <a href="Kankakee%2C%20Beaverville%20and%20Southern%20Railroad">Kankakee, Beaverville and Southern</a>. The <a href="Vermilion%20Valley%20Railroad">Vermilion Valley Railroad</a> serves the <a href="Flex-N-Gate%20Corporation">Flex-N-Gate</a> factory near Covington and runs west from the plant through the town of Foster to meet a <a href="CSX%20Transportation">CSX</a> line in Danville.

The nearest airport is the small <a href="Vermilion%20Regional%20Airport">Vermilion Regional Airport</a>, located northeast of Danville, Illinois. <a href="Purdue%20University%20Airport">Purdue University Airport</a> is Indiana's second busiest airport and is operated by Purdue University in neighboring Tippecanoe County to the northeast. <a href="Indianapolis%20International%20Airport">Indianapolis International Airport</a> is located about to the southeast.

Warren County's economy is supported by a labor force of approximately 4,815 workers with an unemployment rate in July 2010 of 8.8%. Farming is a significant part of the economy, employing approximately 14% of the county's workers and supporting <a href="grain%20elevators">grain elevators</a> in most towns. In some cases, the elevator is the town's only formal business. The county's farmland is highly productive and is among the top 10% of Indiana counties in terms of crop yield per acre. In 2009, of <a href="maize">corn</a> was planted and acres harvested, yielding an average of 187 bushels per acre (11.7 metric tons per hectare) for a total corn production of 17.4 million bushels (441,980 metric tons). Approximately of <a href="soybeans">soybeans</a> were planted, yielding 55 bushels per acre (3.7 metric tons per hectare) for a total of 3.96 million bushels (107,774 metric tons).

Hathor was a major <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20deities">goddess</a> in <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">ancient Egyptian religion</a> who played a wide variety of roles. As a <a href="sky%20deity">sky deity</a>, she was the mother or consort of the sky god <a href="Horus">Horus</a> and the <a href="sun%20god">sun god</a> <a href="Ra">Ra</a>, both of whom were connected with kingship, and thus she was the symbolic mother of their earthly representatives, the <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>s. She was one of several goddesses who acted as the <a href="Eye%20of%20Ra">Eye of Ra</a>, Ra's feminine counterpart, and in this form she had a vengeful aspect that protected him from his enemies. Her beneficent side represented music, dance, joy, love, sexuality and maternal care, and she acted as the consort of several male deities and the mother of their sons. These two aspects of the goddess exemplified the <a href="women%20in%20ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian conception</a> of <a href="femininity">femininity</a>. Hathor crossed boundaries between worlds, helping deceased <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20conception%20of%20the%20soul">souls</a> in the transition to the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20afterlife%20beliefs">afterlife</a>.

Hathor was often depicted as a <a href="Cattle%20in%20religion">cow</a>, symbolizing her maternal and celestial aspect, although her most common form was a woman wearing a headdress of cow horns and a sun disk. She could also be represented as a lioness, cobra, or <a href="Ficus%20sycomorus">sycomore tree</a>.

Cattle goddesses similar to Hathor were portrayed in <a href="art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian art</a> in the fourth millennium BC, but she may not have appeared until the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> (c. 2686–2181 BC). With the patronage of Old Kingdom rulers she became one of Egypt's most important deities. More <a href="Egyptian%20temple">temples</a> were dedicated to her than to any other goddess, of which the most prominent was <a href="Dendera%20Temple%20complex">Dendera Temple</a> in <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>. She was also worshipped in the temples of her male consorts. The Egyptians connected her with foreign lands such as <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> and <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> and their valuable goods, such as <a href="incense">incense</a> and <a href="semiprecious">semiprecious</a> stones, and some of the peoples in those lands adopted her worship. In Egypt, she was one of the deities commonly invoked in private prayers and <a href="votive%20offerings">votive offerings</a>, particularly by women desiring children.

During the <a href="New%20Kingdom">New Kingdom</a> (c. 1550–1070 BC), goddesses such as <a href="Mut">Mut</a> and <a href="Isis">Isis</a> encroached on Hathor's position in royal ideology, but she remained one of the most widely worshipped deities. After the end of the New Kingdom, Hathor was increasingly overshadowed by Isis, but she continued to be venerated until the <a href="decline%20of%20ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">extinction of ancient Egyptian religion</a> in the early centuries AD.

Images of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20cattle">cattle</a> appear frequently in the <a href="art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">artwork</a> of <a href="Predynastic%20Egypt">Predynastic Egypt</a> (before c. 3100 BC), as do images of women with upraised, curved arms reminiscent of the shape of bovine horns. Both types of imagery may represent <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20deities">goddesses</a> connected with <a href="Cattle%20in%20religion">cattle</a>. Cows are <a href="cattle%20in%20religion%20and%20mythology">venerated in many cultures</a>, including ancient Egypt, as symbols of motherhood and nourishment, because they care for their calves and supply humans with milk. The <a href="list%20of%20ancient%20Egyptian%20palettes%23Gerzeh%20Palette">Gerzeh Palette</a>, a <a href="cosmetic%20palette">stone palette</a> from the <a href="Naqada%20II">Naqada II</a> period of prehistory (c. 3500–3200 BC), shows the silhouette of a cow's head with inward-curving horns surrounded by stars. The palette suggests that this cow was also linked with the sky, as were several goddesses from later times who were represented in this form: Hathor, <a href="Mehet-Weret">Mehet-Weret</a>, and <a href="Nut%20%28goddess%29">Nut</a>.

Despite these early precedents, Hathor is not unambiguously mentioned or depicted until the <a href="Fourth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fourth Dynasty</a> (c. 2613–2494 BC) of the <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom</a>, although several artifacts that refer to her may date to the <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20%28Egypt%29">Early Dynastic Period</a> (c. 3100–2686 BC). When Hathor does clearly appear, her horns curve outward, rather than inward like those in Predynastic art. A bovine deity with inward-curving horns appears on the <a href="Narmer%20Palette">Narmer Palette</a> from near the start of Egyptian history, both atop the palette and on the belt of the king, <a href="Narmer">Narmer</a>. The Egyptologist Henry George Fischer suggested this deity may be <a href="Bat%20%28goddess%29">Bat</a>, a goddess later depicted with a woman's face and inward-curling antennae, seemingly reflecting the curve of the cow horns. The Egyptologist Lana Troy, however, identifies a passage in the "<a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid Texts</a>" from the late Old Kingdom that connects Hathor with the "apron" of the king, reminiscent of the goddess on Narmer's belt, and suggests the goddess on the Narmer Palette is Hathor rather than Bat.

In the Fourth Dynasty, Hathor rose rapidly to prominence. She supplanted an early crocodile god who was worshipped at <a href="Dendera">Dendera</a> in <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a> to become Dendera's patron deity, and she increasingly absorbed the cult of Bat in the neighboring region of <a href="Hu%2C%20Egypt">Hu</a>, so that in the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> (c. 2055–1650 BC) the two deities fused into one. The theology surrounding the <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a> in the Old Kingdom, unlike that of earlier times, focused heavily on the sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a> as <a href="king%20of%20the%20gods">king of the gods</a> and father and patron of the earthly king. Hathor ascended with Ra and became his mythological wife, and thus divine mother of the pharaoh.

Hathor took many forms and appeared in a wide variety of roles. The Egyptologist Robyn Gillam suggests that these diverse forms emerged when the royal goddess promoted by the Old Kingdom court subsumed many local goddesses worshipped by the general populace, who were then treated as manifestations of her. Egyptian texts often speak of the manifestations of the goddess as "Seven Hathors" or, less commonly, of many more Hathors—as many as 362. For these reasons, Gillam calls her "a type of deity rather than a single entity". Hathor's diversity reflects the diversity of traits that the Egyptians associated with goddesses. More than any other deity, she exemplifies the <a href="women%20in%20ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian perception</a> of <a href="femininity">femininity</a>.

Hathor was given the <a href="epithet">epithet</a>s "mistress of the sky" and "mistress of the stars", and was said to dwell in the sky with Ra and other sun gods. Egyptians thought of the sky as a body of water through which the sun god sailed, and connected it with the waters from which, according to their <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20creation%20myths">creation myths</a>, the sun emerged at the beginning of time. This cosmic mother goddess was often represented as a cow. Hathor and Mehet-Weret were both thought of as the cow who birthed the sun god and placed him between her horns. Like another celestial goddess, Hathor was said to give birth to the sun god each dawn.

Hathor's <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a> name was "ḥwt-ḥrw" or "ḥwt-ḥr". It is typically translated "house of Horus" but can also be rendered as "my house is the sky". The falcon god <a href="Horus">Horus</a> represented, among other things, the sun and sky. The "house" referred to may be the sky in which Horus lives, or the goddess's womb from which he, as a sun god, is born each day.

Hathor was herself a solar deity, a feminine counterpart to sun gods like Horus and Ra, and was a member of the divine entourage that accompanied Ra as he sailed through the sky in his <a href="barque%23Barques%20and%20barque%20shrines%20in%20Ancient%20Egypt">barque</a>. She was commonly called the "Golden One", referring to the radiance of the sun, and texts from <a href="Dendera%20Temple%20complex">her temple at Dendera</a> say "her rays illuminate the whole earth." She was sometimes fused with another goddess, <a href="Nebethetepet">Nebethetepet</a>, whose name can mean "Lady of the Offering", "Lady of Contentment", or "Lady of the Vulva". At Ra's cult center of <a href="Heliopolis%20%28ancient%20Egypt%29">Heliopolis</a>, Hathor-Nebethetepet was worshipped as his consort, and Rudolf Anthes argued that Hathor's name referred to a mythical "house of Horus" at Heliopolis that was connected with the ideology of kingship.

She was one of many goddesses to take the role of the Eye of Ra, a feminine personification of the disk of the sun and an extension of Ra's own power. Ra was sometimes portrayed inside the disk, which Troy interprets as meaning that the Eye goddess was thought of as a womb from which the sun god was born. Hathor's seemingly contradictory roles as mother, wife, and daughter of Ra reflected the daily cycle of the sun. At sunset the god entered the body of the goddess, impregnating her and fathering the deities born from her womb at sunrise: himself and the Eye goddess, who would later give birth to him. Ra gave rise to his daughter, the Eye goddess, who in turn gave rise to him, her son, in a cycle of constant regeneration.

The Eye of Ra protected the sun god from his enemies and was often represented as a <a href="uraeus">uraeus</a>, or rearing <a href="cobra">cobra</a>, or as a lioness. A form of the Eye of Ra known as "Hathor of the Four Faces", represented by a set of four cobras, was said to face in each of the <a href="cardinal%20directions">cardinal directions</a> to watch for threats to the sun god. A group of myths, known from the <a href="New%20Kingdom">New Kingdom</a> (c. 1550–1070 BC) onward, describe what happens when the Eye goddess rampages uncontrolled. In the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20texts">funerary text</a> known as the "<a href="Book%20of%20the%20Heavenly%20Cow">Book of the Heavenly Cow</a>", Ra sends Hathor as the Eye of Ra to punish humans for plotting rebellion against his rule. She becomes the lioness goddess <a href="Sekhmet">Sekhmet</a> and massacres the rebellious humans, but Ra decides to prevent her from killing all humanity. He orders that beer be dyed red and poured out over the land. The Eye goddess drinks the beer, mistaking it for blood, and in her inebriated state reverts to being the benign and beautiful Hathor. Related to this story is the myth of the Distant Goddess, from the <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Late</a> and <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic</a> periods. The Eye goddess, sometimes in the form of Hathor, rebels against Ra's control and rampages freely in a foreign land: <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Libya</a> west of Egypt or <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> to the south. Weakened by the loss of his Eye, Ra sends another god, such as <a href="Thoth">Thoth</a>, to return her to her benign form and bring her back to him. Once pacified, the goddess returns to become the consort of the sun god or of the god who brings her back. The two aspects of the Eye goddess—violent and dangerous versus beautiful and joyful—reflected the Egyptian belief that women, as the Egyptologist Carolyn Graves-Brown puts it, "encompassed both extreme passions of fury and love."

Egyptian religion celebrated the sensory pleasures of life, believed to be among the gods' gifts to humanity. Egyptians ate, drank, danced, and played music at their religious festivals. They perfumed the air with flowers and <a href="incense">incense</a>. Many of Hathor's epithets link her to celebration; she is called the mistress of music, dance, garlands, <a href="myrrh">myrrh</a>, and drunkenness. In hymns and temple reliefs, musicians play tambourines, harps, lyres, and sistra in Hathor's honor. The <a href="sistrum">sistrum</a>, a rattle-like instrument, was particularly important in Hathor's worship. Sistra had erotic connotations and, by extension, alluded to the creation of new life.

These aspects of Hathor were linked with the myth of the Eye of Ra. The Eye was pacified by beer in the story of the Destruction of Mankind. In some versions of the Distant Goddess myth, the wandering Eye's wildness abated when she was appeased with products of civilization like music, dance, and wine. The water of the annual <a href="inundation%20of%20the%20Nile">inundation of the Nile</a>, colored red by sediment, was likened to wine, and to the red-dyed beer in the Destruction of Mankind. Festivals during the inundation therefore incorporated drink, music, and dance as a way to appease the returning goddess. A text from the <a href="Temple%20of%20Edfu">Temple of Edfu</a> says of Hathor, "the gods play the sistrum for her, the goddesses dance for her to dispel her bad temper." A hymn to the goddess <a href="Raet-Tawy">Raet-Tawy</a> as a form of Hathor at the temple of <a href="Medamud">Medamud</a> describes the Festival of Drunkenness as part of her mythic return to Egypt. Women carry bouquets of flowers, drunken revelers play drums, and people and animals from foreign lands dance for her as she enters the temple's festival booth. The noise of the celebration drives away hostile powers and ensures the goddess will remain in her joyful form as she awaits the male god of the temple, her mythological consort <a href="Montu">Montu</a>, whose son she will bear.

Hathor's joyful, ecstatic side indicates her feminine, procreative power. In some creation myths she helped produce the world itself. <a href="Atum">Atum</a>, a creator god who contained all things within himself, was said to have produced <a href="Shu%20%28Egyptian%20deity%29">Shu</a> and <a href="Tefnut">Tefnut</a>, and thus begun the process of creation, by masturbating. The hand he used for this act, the Hand of Atum, represented the female aspect of himself and could be personified by Hathor, Nebethetepet, or another goddess, <a href="Iusaaset">Iusaaset</a>. In a late creation myth from the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Period">Ptolemaic Period</a> (332–30 BC), the god <a href="Khonsu">Khonsu</a> is put in a central role; Hathor is the goddess with whom Khonsu mates to enable creation.

Hathor could be the consort of many male gods, of whom Ra was only the most prominent. <a href="Mut">Mut</a> was the usual consort of <a href="Amun">Amun</a>, the preeminent deity during the New Kingdom who was often linked with Ra. But Mut was rarely portrayed alongside Amun in contexts related to sex or fertility, and in those circumstances, Hathor or Isis stood at his side instead. In the late periods of Egyptian history, the form of Hathor from Dendera and the form of Horus from Edfu were considered husband and wife and in different versions of the myth of the Distant Goddess, Hathor-Raettawy was the consort of Montu and Hathor-Tefnut the consort of Shu.

Hathor's sexual side was seen in some <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20literature%23Narrative%20tales%20and%20stories">short stories</a>. In a cryptic fragment of a Middle Kingdom story, known as "The Tale of the Herdsman", a herdsman encounters a hairy, animal-like goddess in a marsh and reacts with terror. On another day he encounters her as a nude, alluring woman. Most Egyptologists who study this story think this woman is Hathor or a goddess like her, one who can be wild and dangerous or benign and erotic. Thomas Schneider interprets the text as implying that between his two encounters with the goddess the herdsman has done something to pacify her. In "<a href="The%20Contendings%20of%20Horus%20and%20Set">The Contendings of Horus and Set</a>", a New Kingdom short story about the <a href="Osiris%20myth%23Conflict%20of%20Horus%20and%20Set">dispute between those two gods</a>, Ra is upset after being insulted by another god, <a href="Babi%20%28mythology%29">Babi</a>, and lies on his back alone. After some time, Hathor exposes her genitals to Ra, making him laugh and get up again to perform his duties as ruler of the gods. Life and order were thought to be dependent on Ra's activity, and the story implies that Hathor averted the disastrous consequences of his idleness. Her act may have lifted Ra's spirits partly because it sexually aroused him, although why he laughed is not fully understood.

Hathor was praised for her beautiful hair. Egyptian literature contains allusions to a myth not clearly described in any surviving texts, in which Hathor lost a lock of hair that represented her sexual allure. One text compares this loss with Horus's loss of his <a href="Eye%20of%20Horus">divine Eye</a> and <a href="Set%20%28mythology%29">Set</a>'s loss of his testicles during the struggle between the two gods, implying that the loss of Hathor's lock was as catastrophic for her as the maiming of Horus and Set was for them.

Hathor was called "mistress of love", as an extension of her sexual aspect. In the series of love poems from Papyrus Chester Beatty I, from the <a href="Twentieth%20Dynasty">Twentieth Dynasty</a> (c. 1189–1077 BC), men and women ask Hathor to bring their lovers to them: "I prayed to her [Hathor] and she heard my prayer. She destined my mistress [loved one] for me. And she came of her own free will to see me."

Hathor was considered the mother of various child deities. As suggested by her name, she was often thought of as both Horus's mother and consort. As both the king's wife and mother of his heir, Hathor was the mythic counterpart of human queens.

Isis and Osiris were considered Horus's parents in the <a href="Osiris%20myth">Osiris myth</a> as far back as the late Old Kingdom, but the relationship between Horus and Hathor may be older still. If so, Horus only came to be linked with Isis and Osiris as the Osiris myth emerged during the Old Kingdom. Even after Isis was firmly established as Horus's mother, Hathor continued to appear in this role, especially when nursing the pharaoh. Images of the Hathor-cow with a child in a papyrus thicket represented her mythological upbringing in a secluded marsh. Goddesses' milk was a sign of divinity and royal status. Thus, images in which Hathor nurses the pharaoh represent his right to rule. Hathor's relationship with Horus gave a healing aspect to her character, as she was said to have restored Horus's missing eye or eyes after Set attacked him. In the version of this episode in "The Contendings of Horus and Set", Hathor finds Horus with his eyes torn out and heals the wounds with gazelle's milk.

Beginning in the <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Late Period</a> (664–323 BC), temples focused on the worship of a divine family: an adult male deity, his wife, and their immature son. Satellite buildings, known as <a href="mammisis">mammisis</a>, were built in celebration of the birth of the local child deity. The child god represented the cyclical renewal of the cosmos and an archetypal heir to the kingship. Hathor was the mother in many of these local triads of gods. At Dendera, the mature Horus of Edfu was the father and Hathor the mother, while their child was <a href="Ihy">Ihy</a>, a god whose name meant "sistrum-player" and who personified the jubilation associated with the instrument. Other children of Hathor included a minor deity from the town of Hu, named Neferhotep, and several child forms of Horus.

The milky sap of the <a href="ficus%20sycomorus">sycomore tree</a>, which the Egyptians regarded as a symbol of life, became one of her symbols. The milk was equated with water of the Nile inundation and thus fertility. In the late Ptolemaic and <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman Periods</a>, many temples contained a creation myth that adapted long-standing ideas about creation. The version from Hathor's temple at Dendera emphasizes that she, as a female solar deity, was the first being to emerge from the primordial waters that preceded creation, and it says that her life-giving light and milk nourished all living things.

Like <a href="Meskhenet">Meskhenet</a>, another goddess who presided over birth, Hathor was connected with "<a href="shai">shai</a>", the Egyptian concept of <a href="fate">fate</a>, particularly when she took the form of the Seven Hathors. In two New Kingdom works of fiction, "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Two%20Brothers">The Tale of Two Brothers</a>" and "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20the%20Doomed%20Prince">The Tale of the Doomed Prince</a>", the Hathors appear at the births of major characters and foretell the manner of their deaths.

Hathor's maternal aspects can be compared with those of Isis and Mut, yet there are many contrasts between them. Isis's devotion to her husband and care for their child represented a more socially acceptable form of love than Hathor's uninhibited sexuality, and Mut's character was more authoritative than sexual. The text of the first century AD <a href="Papyrus%20Insinger">Papyrus Insinger</a> likens a faithful wife, the mistress of a household, to Mut, while comparing Hathor to a strange woman who tempts a married man.

Egypt maintained trade relations with the coastal cities of <a href="Syria%20%28region%29">Syria</a> and <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>, particularly <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a>, placing Egyptian religion in contact with the <a href="ancient%20Canaanite%20religion">religions of that region</a>. At some point, perhaps as early as the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians began to refer to the patron goddess of Byblos, <a href="Baalat%20Gebal">Baalat Gebal</a>, as a local form of Hathor. So strong was Hathor's link to Byblos that texts from Dendera say she resided there. The Egyptians sometimes equated <a href="Anat">Anat</a>, an aggressive Canaanite goddess who came to be worshipped in Egypt during the New Kingdom, with Hathor. Some Canaanite artworks depict a nude goddess with a curling wig taken from Hathor's iconography. Which goddess these images represent is not known, but the Egyptians adopted her iconography and came to regard her as an independent deity, <a href="Qetesh">Qetesh</a>, whom they associated with Hathor.

Hathor's solar character may have played a role in linking her with trade: she was believed to protect ships on the Nile and in the seas beyond Egypt, as she protected the barque of Ra in the sky. The mythological wandering of the Eye goddess in Nubia or Libya gave her a connection with those lands as well.

Hathor was closely connected with the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a>, which was not considered part of Egypt proper but was the site of Egyptian mines for copper, <a href="turquoise">turquoise</a>, and <a href="malachite">malachite</a> during the Middle and New Kingdoms. One of Hathor's epithets, "Lady of "Mefkat"", may have referred specifically to turquoise or to all blue-green minerals. She was also called "Lady of <a href="Egyptian%20faience">Faience</a>", a blue-green ceramic that Egyptians likened to turquoise. Hathor was also worshipped at various quarries and mining sites in Egypt's <a href="Eastern%20Desert">Eastern Desert</a>, such as the <a href="amethyst">amethyst</a> mines of Wadi el-Hudi, where she was sometimes called "Lady of Amethyst".

South of Egypt, Hathor's influence is thought to have extended over the <a href="land%20of%20Punt">land of Punt</a>, which lay along the Red Sea coast and was a major source for the incense with which Hathor was linked, as well as with Nubia, northwest of Punt. The <a href="autobiography%20of%20Harkhuf">autobiography of Harkhuf</a>, an official in the <a href="Sixth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Sixth Dynasty</a> (c. 2345–2181 BC), describes his expedition to a land in or near Nubia, from which he brought back great quantities of <a href="ebony">ebony</a>, panther skins, and incense for the king. The text describes these exotic goods as Hathor's gift to the pharaoh. Egyptian expeditions to mine gold in Nubia introduced her cult to the region during the Middle and New Kingdoms, and New Kingdom pharaohs built several temples to her in the portions of Nubia that they ruled.

Hathor was one of several goddesses believed to assist deceased souls in the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20afterlife%20beliefs">afterlife</a>. One of these was <a href="Imentet">Imentet</a>, the goddess of the west, who personified the <a href="necropolises">necropolises</a>, or clusters of tombs, on the west bank of the Nile, and the realm of the afterlife itself. She was often regarded as a specialized manifestation of Hathor.

Just as she crossed the boundary between Egypt and foreign lands, Hathor passed through the boundary between the living and the <a href="Duat">Duat</a>, the realm of the dead. She helped the spirits of deceased humans enter the Duat and was closely linked with tomb sites, where that transition began. The <a href="Theban%20necropolis">Theban necropolis</a>, for example, was often portrayed as a stylized mountain with the cow of Hathor emerging from it. Her role as a sky goddess was also linked to the afterlife. Because the sky goddess—either Nut or Hathor—assisted Ra in his daily rebirth, she had an important part in <a href="Egyptian%20afterlife%20beliefs">Egyptian afterlife beliefs</a>, according to which deceased humans were reborn like the sun god. Coffins, tombs, and the underworld itself were interpreted as the womb of this goddess, from which the deceased soul would be reborn.

Nut, Hathor, and Imentet could each, in different texts, lead the deceased into a place where they would receive food and drink for eternal sustenance. Thus, Hathor, as Imentet, often appears on tombs, welcoming the deceased person as her child into a blissful afterlife. In New Kingdom funerary texts and artwork, the afterlife was often illustrated as a pleasant, fertile garden, over which Hathor sometimes presided. The welcoming afterlife goddess was often portrayed as a goddess in the form of a tree, giving water to the deceased. Nut most commonly filled this role, but the tree goddess was sometimes called Hathor instead.

The afterlife also had a sexual aspect. In the Osiris myth, the murdered god <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> was resurrected when he copulated with Isis and conceived Horus. In solar ideology, Ra's union with the sky goddess allowed his own rebirth. Sex therefore enabled the rebirth of the deceased, and goddesses like Isis and Hathor served to rouse the deceased to new life. But they merely stimulated the male deities' regenerative powers, rather than playing the central role.

Ancient Egyptians prefixed the names of the deceased with Osiris's name to connect them with his resurrection. For example, a woman named <a href="Henutmehyt">Henutmehyt</a> would be dubbed "Osiris-Henutmehyt". Over time they increasingly associated the deceased with both male and female divine powers. As early as the late Old Kingdom, women were sometimes said to join the worshippers of Hathor in the afterlife, just as men joined the following of Osiris. In the <a href="Third%20Intermediate%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Third Intermediate Period</a> (c. 1070–664 BC), Egyptians began to add Hathor's name to that of deceased women in place of that of Osiris. In some cases, women were called "Osiris-Hathor", indicating that they benefited from the revivifying power of both deities. In these late periods, Hathor was sometimes said to rule the afterlife as Osiris did.

Hathor was often depicted as a cow bearing the sun disk between her horns, especially when shown nursing the king. She could also appear as a woman with the head of a cow. Her most common form, however, was a woman wearing a headdress of the horns and sun disk, often with a red or turquoise sheath dress, or a dress combining both colors. Sometimes the horns stood atop a low <a href="modius%20%28headdress%29">modius</a> or the vulture headdress that Egyptian queens often wore in the New Kingdom. Because Isis adopted the same headdress during the New Kingdom, the two goddesses can only be distinguished if labeled in writing. When in the role of Imentet, Hathor wore the <a href="emblem%20of%20the%20west">emblem of the west</a> upon her head instead of the horned headdress. The Seven Hathors were sometimes portrayed as a set of seven cows, accompanied by a minor sky and afterlife deity called the Bull of the West.

Some animals other than cattle could represent Hathor. The uraeus was a common motif in Egyptian art and could represent a variety of goddesses who were identified with the Eye of Ra. When Hathor was depicted as a uraeus, it represented the ferocious and protective aspects of her character. She also appeared as a lioness, and this form had a similar meaning. In contrast, the <a href="domestic%20cat">domestic cat</a>, which was sometimes connected with Hathor, often represented the Eye goddess's pacified form. When portrayed as a sycomore tree, Hathor was usually shown with the upper body of her human form emerging from the trunk.

Like other goddesses, Hathor might carry a stalk of papyrus as a staff, though she could instead hold a "<a href="Was-sceptre">was</a>" staff, a symbol of power that was usually restricted to male deities. The only goddesses who used the "was" were those, like Hathor, who were linked with the Eye of Ra. She also commonly carried a sistrum or a "menat" necklace. The sistrum came in two varieties: a simple loop shape or the more complex "naos" sistrum, which was shaped to resemble a "<a href="Cella%23Egyptian%20temples">naos</a>" shrine and flanked by <a href="volute">volute</a>s resembling the antennae of the Bat emblem. The "<a href="menat">menat</a>" necklace, made up of many strands of beads, was shaken in ceremonies in Hathor's honor, similarly to the sistrum. Images of it were sometimes seen as personifications of Hathor herself. Mirrors were another of her symbols, because in Egypt they were often made of gold or bronze and therefore symbolized the sun disk, and because they were connected with beauty and femininity. Some mirror handles were made in the shape of Hathor's face.

Hathor was sometimes represented as a human face with bovine ears, seen from the front rather than in the profile-based perspective that was typical of Egyptian art. When she appears in this form, the tresses on either side of her face often curl into loops. This mask-like face was placed on the <a href="capital%20%28architecture%29">capitals</a> of columns beginning in the late Old Kingdom. Columns of this style were used in many temples to Hathor and other goddesses. These columns have two or four faces, which may represent the duality between different aspects of the goddess or the watchfulness of Hathor of the Four Faces. The designs of Hathoric columns have a complex relationship with those of sistra. Both styles of sistrum can bear the Hathor mask on the handle, and Hathoric columns often incorporate the "naos" sistrum shape above the goddess's head.

During the Early Dynastic Period, <a href="Neith">Neith</a> was the preeminent goddess at the royal court, while in the Fourth Dynasty, Hathor became the goddess most closely linked with the king. The later dynasty's founder, <a href="Sneferu">Sneferu</a>, may have built a temple to her, and a daughter of <a href="Djedefra">Djedefra</a> was her first recorded priestess. Old Kingdom rulers only donated resources to temples dedicated to particular kings or to deities closely connected with kingship. Hathor was one of the few deities to receive such donations. Late Old Kingdom rulers especially promoted the cult of Hathor in the provinces, as a way of binding those regions to the royal court. She may have absorbed the traits of contemporary provincial goddesses.

Many female royals, though not reigning queens, held positions in the cult during the Old Kingdom. <a href="Mentuhotep%20II">Mentuhotep II</a>, who became the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom despite having no relation to the Old Kingdom rulers, sought to legitimize his rule by portraying himself as Hathor's son. The first images of the Hathor-cow suckling the king date to his reign, and several priestesses of Hathor were depicted as though they were his wives, although he may not have actually married them. In the course of the Middle Kingdom, queens were increasingly seen as directly embodying the goddess, just as the king embodied Ra. The emphasis on the queen as Hathor continued through the New Kingdom. Queens were portrayed with the headdress of Hathor beginning in the late Eighteenth Dynasty. An image of the <a href="sed%20festival">sed festival</a> of <a href="Amenhotep%20III">Amenhotep III</a>, meant to celebrate and renew his rule, shows the king together with Hathor and his queen <a href="Tiye">Tiye</a>, which could mean that the king symbolically married the goddess in the course of the festival.

<a href="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a>, a woman who ruled as a pharaoh in the early New Kingdom, emphasized her relationship to Hathor in a different way. She used <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20royal%20titulary">names and titles</a> that linked her to a variety of goddesses, including Hathor, so as to legitimize her rule in what was normally a male position. She built several temples to Hathor and placed her own <a href="Mortuary%20Temple%20of%20Hatshepsut">mortuary temple</a>, which incorporated a chapel dedicated to the goddess, at <a href="Deir%20el-Bahari">Deir el-Bahari</a>, which had been a cult site of Hathor since the Middle Kingdom.

The preeminence of Amun during the New Kingdom gave greater visibility to his consort Mut, and in the course of the period, Isis began appearing in roles that traditionally belonged to Hathor alone, such as that of the goddess in the solar barque. Despite the growing prominence of these deities, Hathor remained important, particularly in relation to fertility, sexuality, and queenship, throughout the New Kingdom.

After the New Kingdom, Isis increasingly overshadowed Hathor and other goddesses as she took on their characteristics. In the <a href="Ptolemaic%20period">Ptolemaic period</a> (305–30 BC), when <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a> governed Egypt and <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20religion">their religion</a> developed a complex relationship with that of Egypt, the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a> adopted and modified the Egyptian ideology of kingship. Beginning with <a href="Arsinoe%20II">Arsinoe II</a>, wife of <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a>, the Ptolemies closely linked their queens with Isis and with several Greek goddesses, particularly their own goddess of love and sexuality, <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>. Nevertheless, when the Greeks referred to Egyptian gods by the names of their own gods (a practice called "<a href="interpretatio%20Graeca">interpretatio Graeca</a>"), they sometimes called Hathor Aphrodite. Traits of Isis, Hathor, and Aphrodite were all combined to justify the treatment of Ptolemaic queens as goddesses. Thus, the poet <a href="Callimachus">Callimachus</a> alluded to the myth of Hathor's lost lock of hair when praising <a href="Berenice%20II">Berenice II</a> for sacrificing her own hair to Aphrodite, and iconographic traits that Isis and Hathor shared, such as the bovine horns and vulture headdress, appeared on images portraying Ptolemaic queens as Aphrodite.

More temples were dedicated to Hathor than to any other Egyptian goddess. During the Old Kingdom her most important center of worship was in the region of <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>, where "Hathor of the Sycomore" was worshipped at many sites throughout the <a href="Memphite%20Necropolis">Memphite Necropolis</a>. During the New Kingdom era, the temple of Hathor of the Southern Sycomore was her main temple in Memphis. At that site she was described as the daughter of the city's main deity, <a href="Ptah">Ptah</a>. The cult of Ra and Atum at Heliopolis, northeast of Memphis, included a temple to Hathor-Nebethetepet that was probably built in the Middle Kingdom. A willow and a sycomore tree stood near the sanctuary and may have been worshipped as manifestations of the goddess. A few cities farther north in the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a>, such as <a href="Yamu">Yamu</a> and <a href="Terenuthis">Terenuthis</a>, also had temples to her.

As the rulers of the Old Kingdom made an effort to develop towns in Upper and <a href="Middle%20Egypt">Middle Egypt</a>, several cult centers of Hathor were founded across the region, at sites such as <a href="Cusae">Cusae</a>, <a href="Akhmim">Akhmim</a>, and <a href="Naga%20ed-Der">Naga ed-Der</a>. In the <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period">First Intermediate Period</a> (c. 2181–2055) her cult statue from Dendera was periodically carried to the Theban necropolis. During the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, Mentuhotep II established a permanent cult center for her in the necropolis at Deir el-Bahari. The nearby village of <a href="Deir%20el-Medina">Deir el-Medina</a>, home to the tomb workers of the necropolis during the New Kingdom, also contained temples of Hathor. One continued to function and was periodically rebuilt as late as the Ptolemaic Period, centuries after the village was abandoned.

Dendera, Hathor's oldest temple in Upper Egypt dates to at least to the Fourth Dynasty. After the end of the Old Kingdom it surpassed her Memphite temples in importance. Many kings made additions to the temple complex through Egyptian history. The last version of the temple was built in the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods and is today one of the best-preserved Egyptian temples from that time.

In the Old Kingdom, most priests of Hathor, including the highest ranks, were women. Many of these women were members of the royal family. In the course of the Middle Kingdom, women were increasingly excluded from the highest priestly positions, at the same time that queens were becoming more closely tied to Hathor's cult. Thus, non-royal women disappeared from the high ranks of Hathor's priesthood, although women continued to serve as musicians and singers in temple cults across Egypt.

The most frequent temple rite for any deity was the daily offering ritual, in which the cult image, or statue, of a deity would be clothed and given food. The daily ritual was largely the same in every Egyptian temple, although the goods given as offerings could vary according to which deity received them. Wine and beer were common offerings in all temples, but especially in rituals in Hathor's honor, and she and the goddesses related to her often received sistra and "menat" necklaces. In Late and Ptolemaic times, they were also offered a pair of mirrors, representing the sun and the moon.

Many of Hathor's annual festivals were celebrated with drinking and dancing that served a ritual purpose. Revelers at these festivals may have aimed to reach a state of <a href="religious%20ecstasy">religious ecstasy</a>, which was otherwise rare or nonexistent in ancient Egyptian religion. Graves-Brown suggests that celebrants in Hathor's festivals aimed to reach an <a href="altered%20state%20of%20consciousness">altered state of consciousness</a> to allow them interact with the divine realm. An example is the Festival of Drunkenness, commemorating the return of the Eye of Ra, which was celebrated on the twentieth day of the <a href="Thout">month of Thout</a> at temples to Hathor and to other Eye goddesses. It was celebrated as early as the Middle Kingdom, but it is best known from Ptolemaic and Roman times. The dancing, eating and drinking that took place during the Festival of Drunkenness represented the opposite of the sorrow, hunger, and thirst that the Egyptians associated with death. Whereas the rampages of the Eye of Ra brought death to humans, the Festival of Drunkenness celebrated life, abundance, and joy.

In a local Theban festival known as the <a href="Beautiful%20Festival%20of%20the%20Valley">Beautiful Festival of the Valley</a>, which began to be celebrated in the Middle Kingdom, the cult image of Amun from the <a href="Precinct%20of%20Amun-Re">Temple of Karnak</a> visited the temples in the Theban Necropolis while members of the community went to the tombs of their deceased relatives to drink, eat, and celebrate. Hathor was not involved in this festival until the early New Kingdom, after which Amun's overnight stay in the temples at Deir el-Bahari came to be seen as his sexual union with her.

Several temples in Ptolemaic times, including that of Dendera, observed the Egyptian new year with a series of ceremonies in which images of the temple deity were supposed to be revitalized by contact with the sun god. On the days leading up to the new year, Dendera's statue of Hathor was taken to the "<a href="wabet">wabet</a>", a specialized room in the temple, and placed under a ceiling decorated with images of the sky and sun. On the first day of the new year, the first day of the <a href="Thoth%20%28month%29">month of Thoth</a>, the Hathor image was carried up to the roof to be bathed in genuine sunlight.

The best-documented festival focused on Hathor is another Ptolemaic celebration, the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion. It took place over fourteen days in the month of <a href="Epiphi">Epiphi</a>. Hathor's cult image from Dendera was carried by boat to several temple sites to visit the gods of those temples. The endpoint of the journey was the Temple of Horus at <a href="Edfu">Edfu</a>, where the Hathor statue from Dendera met that of Horus of Edfu and the two were placed together. On one day of the festival, these images were carried out to a shrine where primordial deities such as the sun god and the <a href="Ennead">Ennead</a> were said to be buried. The texts say the divine couple performed offering rites for these entombed gods. Many Egyptologists regard this festival as a <a href="hieros%20gamos">ritual marriage</a> between Horus and Hathor, although Martin Stadler challenges this view, arguing that it instead represented the rejuvenation of the buried creator gods. C. J. Bleeker thought the Beautiful Reunion was another celebration of the return of the Distant Goddess, citing allusions in the temple's festival texts to the myth of the solar eye. Barbara Richter argues that the festival represented all three things at once. She points out that the birth of Horus and Hathor's son Ihy was celebrated at Dendera nine months after the Festival of the Beautiful Reunion, implying that Hathor's visit to Horus represented Ihy's conception.

The third month of the <a href="Egyptian%20calendar">Egyptian calendar</a>, <a href="Hathor%20%28month%29">Hathor or Athyr</a>, was named for the goddess. Festivities in her honor took place throughout the month, although they are not recorded in the texts from Dendera.

Egyptian kings as early as the Old Kingdom donated goods to the temple of Baalat Gebal in Byblos, using the syncretism of Baalat with Hathor to cement their close trading relationship with Byblos. A temple to Hathor as Lady of Byblos was built during the reign of <a href="Thutmose%20III">Thutmose III</a>, although it may simply have been a shrine within the temple of Baalat. After the breakdown of the New Kingdom, Hathor's prominence in Byblos diminished along with Egypt's trade links to the city. A few artifacts from the early first millennium BC suggest that the Egyptians began equating Baalat with Isis at that time. A myth about Isis's presence in Byblos, related by the Greek author <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> in his work "On Isis and Osiris" in the 2nd century AD, suggests that by his time Isis had entirely supplanted Hathor in the city.

Egyptians in the Sinai built a few temples in the region. The largest was a complex dedicated primarily to Hathor as patroness of mining at <a href="Serabit%20el-Khadim">Serabit el-Khadim</a>, on the west side of the peninsula. It was occupied from the middle of the Middle Kingdom to near the end of the New. The <a href="Timna%20Valley">Timna Valley</a>, on the fringes of the Egyptian empire on the east side of the peninsula, was the site of seasonal mining expeditions during the New Kingdom. It included a shrine to Hathor that was probably deserted during the off-season. The local <a href="Midianites">Midianites</a>, whom the Egyptians used as part of the mining workforce, may have given offerings to Hathor as their overseers did. After the Egyptians abandoned the site in the Twentieth Dynasty, however, the Midianites converted the shrine to a tent shrine devoted to their own deities.

In contrast, the Nubians in the south fully incorporated Hathor into their religion. During the New Kingdom, when most of Nubia was under Egyptian control, pharaohs dedicated several temples in Nubia to Hathor, such as those at <a href="Faras">Faras</a> and <a href="Mirgissa">Mirgissa</a>. Amenhotep III and <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a> both built temples in Nubia that celebrated their respective queens as manifestations of female deities, including Hathor: Amenhotep's wife Tiye at <a href="Sedeinga">Sedeinga</a> and Ramesses's wife <a href="Nefertari">Nefertari</a> at the <a href="Abu%20Simbel%23The%20Small%20Temple">Small Temple of Abu Simbel</a>. The independent Kingdom of Kush, which emerged in Nubia after the collapse of the New Kingdom, based its beliefs about <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Kush">Kushite kings</a> on the royal ideology of Egypt. Therefore, Hathor, Isis, Mut, and Nut were all seen as the mythological mother of each Kushite king and equated with his female relatives, such as the "<a href="kandake">kandake</a>", the Kushite queen or <a href="queen%20mother">queen mother</a>, who had prominent roles in Kushite religion. At <a href="Jebel%20Barkal">Jebel Barkal</a>, a site sacred to Amun, the Kushite king <a href="Taharqa">Taharqa</a> built a pair of temples, one dedicated to Hathor and <a href="Temple%20of%20Mut%2C%20Jebel%20Barkal">one to Mut</a> as consorts of Amun, replacing New Kingdom Egyptian temples that may have been dedicated to these same goddesses. But Isis was the most prominent of the Egyptian goddesses worshipped in Nubia, and her status there increased over time. Thus, in the Meroitic period of Nubian history (c. 300 BC – AD 400), Hathor appeared in temples mainly as a companion to Isis.

In addition to formal and public rituals at temples, Egyptians privately worshipped deities for personal reasons, including at their homes. Birth was hazardous for both mother and child in ancient Egypt, yet children were much desired. Thus fertility and safe childbirth are among the most prominent concerns in their popular religion, and fertility deities such as Hathor and <a href="Taweret">Taweret</a> were commonly worshipped in household shrines. Egyptian women squatted on bricks while giving birth, and the only known surviving birth brick from ancient Egypt is decorated with an image of a woman holding her child flanked by images of Hathor. In Roman times, <a href="terracotta">terracotta</a> figurines, sometimes found in a domestic context, depicted a woman with an elaborate headdress exposing her genitals, as Hathor did to cheer up Ra. The meaning of these figurines is not known, but they are often thought to represent Hathor or Isis combined with Aphrodite making a gesture that represented fertility or protection against evil.

Hathor was one of a handful of deities, including Amun, Ptah, and Thoth, who were commonly prayed to for help with personal problems. Many Egyptians left offerings at temples or small shrines dedicated to the gods they prayed to. Most offerings to Hathor were used for their symbolism, not for their intrinsic value. Cloths painted with images of Hathor were common, as were plaques and figurines depicting her animal forms. Different types of offerings may have symbolized different goals on the part of the donor, but their meaning is usually unknown. Images of Hathor alluded to her mythical roles, like depictions of the maternal cow in the marsh. Offerings of sistra may have been meant to appease the goddess's dangerous aspects and bring out her positive ones, while <a href="phalli">phalli</a> represented a prayer for fertility, as shown by an inscription found on one example. 

Some Egyptians also left written prayers to Hathor, inscribed on <a href="stela">stela</a>e or written as graffiti. Prayers to some deities, such as Amun, show that they were thought to punish wrongdoers and heal people who repented for their misbehavior. In contrast, prayers to Hathor mention only the benefits she could grant, such as abundant food during life and a well-provisioned burial after death.

As an afterlife deity, Hathor appeared frequently in funerary texts and art. In the early New Kingdom, for instance, Osiris, <a href="Anubis">Anubis</a>, and Hathor were the three deities most commonly found in royal tomb decoration. In that period she often appeared as the goddess welcoming the dead into the afterlife. Other images referred to her more obliquely. Reliefs in Old Kingdom tombs show men and women performing a ritual called "shaking the papyrus". The significance of this rite is not known, but inscriptions sometimes say it was performed "for Hathor", and shaking papyrus stalks produces a rustling sound that may have been likened to the rattling of a sistrum. Other Hathoric imagery in tombs included the cow emerging from the mountain of the necropolis and the seated figure of the goddess presiding over a garden in the afterlife. Images of Nut were often painted or incised inside coffins, indicating that the coffin was her womb, from which the occupant would be reborn in the afterlife. In the Third Intermediate Period, Hathor began to be placed on the floor of the coffin, with Nut on the interior of the lid.

Tomb art from the Eighteenth Dynasty often shows people drinking, dancing, and playing music, as well as holding "menat" necklaces and sistra—all imagery that alluded to Hathor. These images may represent private feasts that were celebrated in front of tombs to commemorate the people buried there, or they may show gatherings at temple festivals such as the Beautiful Festival of the Valley. Festivals were thought to allow contact between the human and divine realms, and by extension, between the living and the dead. Thus, texts from tombs often expressed a wish that the deceased would be able to participate in festivals, primarily those dedicated to Osiris. Tombs' festival imagery, however, may refer to festivals involving Hathor, such as the Festival of Drunkenness, or to the private feasts, which were also closely connected with her. Drinking and dancing at these feasts may have been meant to intoxicate the celebrants, as at the Festival of Drunkenness, allowing them to commune with the spirits of the deceased.

Hathor was said to supply offerings to deceased people as early as the Old Kingdom, and spells to enable both men and women to join her retinue in the afterlife appeared as early as the "<a href="Coffin%20Texts">Coffin Texts</a>" in the Middle Kingdom. Some burial goods that portray deceased women as goddesses may depict these women as followers of Hathor, although whether the imagery refers to Hathor or Isis is not known. The link between Hathor and deceased women was maintained into the Roman Period, the last stage of ancient Egyptian religion before its <a href="decline%20of%20ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">extinction</a>.

Carl Nielsen

Carl August Nielsen (; 9 June 18653 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer.

Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of <a href="Funen">Funen</a>, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Danish Academy of Music</a> in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his <a href="Opus%20number">Op</a>. 1, "<a href="Suite%20for%20String%20Orchestra%20%28Nielsen%29">Suite for Strings</a>", in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Orchestra">Royal Danish Orchestra</a> under the conductor <a href="Johan%20Svendsen">Johan Svendsen</a>, during which he played in <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>'s "<a href="Falstaff%20%28opera%29">Falstaff</a>" and "<a href="Otello">Otello</a>" at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death.

Although his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his "psychological" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor <a href="Anne%20Marie%20Carl-Nielsen">Anne Marie Brodersen</a>. Nielsen is especially noted for his six <a href="symphony">symphonies</a>, his <a href="Wind%20Quintet%20%28Nielsen%29">Wind Quintet</a> and his concertos for <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Nielsen%29">violin</a>, <a href="Flute%20Concerto%20%28Nielsen%29">flute</a> and <a href="Clarinet%20Concerto%20%28Nielsen%29">clarinet</a>. In Denmark, his opera "<a href="Maskarade">Maskarade</a>" and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> and <a href="Edvard%20Grieg">Grieg</a>, but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with <a href="progressive%20tonality">progressive tonality</a> and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Nielsen%29">"Sinfonia semplice"</a>, was written in 1924–25. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in <a href="Vestre%20Cemetery">Vestre Cemetery</a>, Copenhagen.

Nielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the international repertoire, accelerating in popularity from the 1960s through <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a> and others. In Denmark, Nielsen's reputation was sealed in 2006 when three of his compositions were <a href="Danish%20Culture%20Canon">listed by the Ministry of Culture</a> amongst the twelve greatest pieces of Danish music. For many years, he appeared on the Danish <a href="Banknotes%20of%20Denmark%2C%201997%20series">hundred-kroner banknote</a>. The <a href="Carl%20Nielsen%20Museum">Carl Nielsen Museum</a> in Odense documents his life and that of his wife. Between 1994 and 2009 the <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Library">Royal Danish Library</a>, sponsored by the Danish government, completed the "<a href="Carl%20Nielsen%20Edition">Carl Nielsen Edition</a>", freely available online, containing background information and sheet music for all of Nielsen's works, many of which had not been previously published.

Nielsen was born the seventh of twelve children to a poor peasant family on 9 June 1865 at <a href="Sortelung">Sortelung</a> near Nørre Lyndelse, south of <a href="Odense">Odense</a> on the island of Funen. His father, Niels Jørgensen, was a house painter and <a href="Danish%20traditional%20music">traditional musician</a> who, with his abilities as a fiddler and cornet player, was in strong demand for local celebrations. Nielsen described his childhood in his autobiography ("My Childhood on Funen"). His mother, whom he recalls singing folk songs during his childhood, came from a well-to-do family of sea captains while one of his half-uncles, Hans Andersen (1837–1881), was a talented musician.

Nielsen gave an account of his introduction to music: "I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when in bed with the measles, I had tried myself out on the little violin". He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six. He learned the violin and piano as a child and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka which the composer mentioned in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper from a nearby village when he was fourteen; the shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play <a href="brass%20instrument">brass instrument</a>s, on 1 November 1879 he became a <a href="bugle%20%28instrument%29">bugler</a> and <a href="Types%20of%20trombone%23Alto%20trombone">alto trombonist</a> in the band of the army's 16th Battalion at nearby Odense.

Nielsen did not give up the violin during his time with the battalion, continuing to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father. The army paid him three <a href="Danish%20krone">kroner</a> and 45 <a href="%C3%B8re">øre</a> and a loaf of bread every five days for two and a half years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes he needed to perform at barn dances.

In 1881, Nielsen began to take his violin playing more seriously, studying privately under Carl Larsen, the <a href="Sexton%20%28office%29">sexton</a> at <a href="Odense%20Cathedral">Odense Cathedral</a>. It is not known how much Nielsen composed during this period, but from his autobiography, it can be deduced that he wrote some trios and quartets for brass instruments, and that he had difficulty in coming to terms with the fact that brass instruments were tuned in different keys. Following an introduction to <a href="Niels%20Gade">Niels W. Gade</a>, the director of the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, by whom he was well received, Nielsen obtained his release from the military band at short notice, and studied at the Academy from the beginning of 1884.

Though not an outstanding student and composing little, Nielsen progressed well in violin under <a href="Valdemar%20Tofte">Valdemar Tofte</a> (1832–1907), and received a solid grounding in <a href="music%20theory">music theory</a> from <a href="Orla%20Rosenhoff">Orla Rosenhoff</a> (1844–1905), who would remain a valued adviser during his early years as a professional composer. He also studied composition under Gade, whom he liked as a friend but not for his music. Contacts with fellow students and cultured families in Copenhagen, some of whom would become lifelong friends, became equally important. The patchy education resulting from his country background left Nielsen insatiably curious about the arts, philosophy and aesthetics. But, in the opinion of the musicologist <a href="David%20Fanning%20%28musicologist%29">David Fanning</a>, it also left him "with a highly personal, common man's point of view on those subjects". He left the Academy at the end of 1886, after graduating with good but not outstanding marks in all subjects. He then went to stay with the retired Odense merchant Jens Georg Nielsen (1820–1901) and his wife at their apartment on Slagelsegade as he was not yet in a position to pay his own way. While there, he fell in love with their 14-year-old daughter Emilie Demant. The affair was to last for the next three years.

On 17 September 1887, Nielsen played the violin in the <a href="Tivoli%20Concert%20Hall">Tivoli Concert Hall</a> when his "Andante tranquillo e Scherzo" for strings was premiered. Shortly afterwards, on 25 January 1888, his String Quartet in F major was played at one of the private performances of the (Private Chamber Music Society). While Nielsen considered the Quartet in F to be his official debut as a professional composer, a far greater impression was made by his "Suite for Strings". Performed at <a href="Tivoli%20Gardens">Tivoli Gardens</a>, Copenhagen on 8 September 1888, it was designated by Nielsen as his Op. 1.

By September 1889 Nielsen had progressed well enough on the violin to gain a position with the second violins in the prestigious Royal Danish Orchestra which played at Copenhagen's <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Theatre">Royal Theatre</a>, then conducted by Johan Svendsen. In this position he experienced Giuseppe Verdi's "Falstaff" and "Otello" at their Danish premieres. Although this employment sometimes caused Nielsen considerable frustration, he continued to play there until 1905. After Svendsen's retirement in 1906, Nielsen increasingly served as conductor (being officially appointed assistant conductor in 1910). Between graduation and attaining this position, he made a modest income from private violin lessons while enjoying the continuing support of his patrons, not only Jens Georg Nielsen but also Albert Sachs (born 1846) and Hans Demant (1827–1897) who both ran factories in Odense. After less than a year at the Royal Theatre, Nielsen won a scholarship of 1,800 kroner, giving him the means to spend several months travelling in Europe.
While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>'s <a href="music%20drama">music drama</a>s, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a> and <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist <a href="Ferruccio%20Busoni">Ferruccio Busoni</a> in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor <a href="Anne%20Marie%20Brodersen">Anne Marie Brodersen</a>, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20English%20Church%2C%20Florence">St Mark's English Church, Florence</a>, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a "love match", but also a "meeting of minds"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a "strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.

Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his "psychological" period. Fanning writes, "At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera "<a href="Saul%20og%20David">Saul and David</a>" and the <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Nielsen%29">Second Symphony ("The Four Temperaments")</a> and the cantatas and ". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.

Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate daughter was born – Rachel Siegmann, about whom Anne Marie never learned. With his wife Nielsen had two daughters and a son. Irmelin, the elder daughter, studied music theory with her father and in December 1919 married Eggert Møller (1893–1978), a medical doctor who became a professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Copenhagen">University of Copenhagen</a> and director of the <a href="polyclinic">polyclinic</a> at the <a href="Rigshospitalet">National Hospital</a>. The younger daughter <a href="Anne%20Marie%20Telm%C3%A1nyi">Anne Marie</a>, who graduated from the <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Copenhagen Academy of Arts</a>, married the Hungarian violinist <a href="Emil%20Telm%C3%A1nyi">Emil Telmányi</a> (1892–1988) in 1918; he contributed to the promotion of Nielsen's music, both as a violinist and a conductor. Nielsen's son, Hans Børge, was handicapped as a result of <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a> and spent most of his life away from the family. He died near Kolding in 1956.

At first, Nielsen's works did not gain sufficient recognition for him to be able to support himself. During the concert which saw the premiere of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Nielsen%29">First Symphony</a> on 14 March 1894 conducted by Svendsen, Nielsen played in the second violin section. The symphony was a great success when played in Berlin in 1896, contributing significantly to his reputation. He was increasingly in demand to write <a href="incidental%20music">incidental music</a> for the theatre as well as cantatas for special occasions, both of which provided a welcome source of additional income. Fanning comments on the relationship which developed between his programmatic and symphonic works: "Sometimes he would find stageworthy ideas in his supposedly pure orchestral music; sometimes a text or scenario forced him to invent vivid musical imagery which he could later turn to more abstract use."

Nielsen's <a href="cantata">cantata</a> "Hymnus amoris" for soloists, chorus and orchestra was first performed at Copenhagen's <a href="Musikforeningen">Musikforeningen</a> (The Music Society) on 27 April 1897. It was inspired by <a href="Titian">Titian</a>'s painting "<a href="Miracle%20of%20the%20Jealous%20Husband">Miracle of the Jealous Husband</a>" which Nielsen had seen on his honeymoon in Italy in 1891. On one of the copies, he wrote: "To my own Marie! These tones in praise of love are nothing compared to the real thing."

Beginning in 1901, Nielsen received a modest state pension – initially 800 kroner per annum, growing to 7,500 kroner by 1927 – to augment his violinist's salary. This allowed him to stop taking private pupils and left him more time to compose. From 1903, he also had an annual retainer from his principal publisher, . Between 1905 and 1914 he served as second conductor at the Royal Theatre. For his son-in-law, Emil Telmányi, Nielsen wrote his Violin Concerto, Op. 33 (1911). From 1914 to 1926, he conducted the Musikforeningen orchestra. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen, and continued to work there until his death.
The strain of dual careers and constant separation from his wife led to an extended breach in his marriage. The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, and separation by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916–22, Nielsen often lived on Funen retreating to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>. The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Nielsen%29">Fourth</a> (1914–16) and <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Nielsen%29">Fifth symphonies</a> (1921–22), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning. The composer was particularly upset in the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication of many of his major works, including "Aladdin" and "Pan and Syrinx".

The sixth and final symphony, "Sinfonia semplice", was written in 1924–25. After suffering a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; in an article in "<a href="Politiken">Politiken</a>" on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end ... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.

Nielsen's final large-scale orchestral works were his Flute Concerto (1926) and the Clarinet Concerto (1928), of which Robert Layton writes: "If ever there was music from another planet, this is surely it. Its sonorities are sparse and monochrome, its air rarefied and bracing." Nielsen's last musical composition, the organ work "<a href="Commotio%20%28Nielsen%29">Commotio</a>", was premiered posthumously in 1931.

During his final years, Nielsen produced a short book of essays entitled "Living Music" (1925), followed in 1927 by his memoir "Min Fynske Barndom". In 1926 he wrote in his diary "My home soil pulls me more and more like a long sucking kiss. Does it mean that I shall finally return and rest in the earth of Funen? Then it must be in the place where I was born: Sortelung, Frydenlands parish".

This was not to be. Nielsen was admitted to Copenhagen's National Hospital (Rigshospitalet) on 1 October 1931 following a series of <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attacks</a>. He died there at ten minutes past midnight on 3 October, surrounded by his family. His last words to them were "You are standing here as if you were waiting for something".

He was buried in Copenhagen's Vestre Cemetery; all the music at his funeral, including the hymns, was the work of the composer. After his death, his wife was commissioned to sculpt a monument to him, to be erected in central Copenhagen. She wrote: "I wanted to take the winged horse, eternal symbol of poetry, and place a musician on its back. He was to sit there between the rushing wings blowing a reed pipe out over Copenhagen." Dispute about her design and a shortfall in funding meant that erection of the monument was delayed and that Anne Marie herself ended up subsidising it. The <a href="Carl%20Nielsen%20Monument">Carl Nielsen Monument</a> was finally unveiled in 1939.

Nielsen's works are sometimes referred to by CNW numbers, based on the "Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works" (CNW) published online by the <a href="Danish%20Royal%20Library">Danish Royal Library</a> in 2015. The CNW catalogue is intended to replace the 1965 catalogue compiled by <a href="Dan%20Fog">Dan Fog</a> and <a href="Torben%20Schousboe">Torben Schousboe</a> (FS numbers).

In his "Lives of the Great Composers", the music critic <a href="Harold%20Schonberg">Harold Schonberg</a> emphasizes the breadth of Nielsen's compositions, his energetic rhythms, generous orchestration and his individuality. In comparing him with <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Jean Sibelius</a>, he considers he had "just as much sweep, even more power, and a more universal message". The <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> music professor Daniel Grimley qualifies Nielsen as "one of the most playful, life-affirming, and awkward voices in twentieth-century music" thanks to the "melodic richness and harmonic vitality" of his work. Anne-Marie Reynolds, author of "Carl Nielsen's Voice: His Songs in Context", cites Robert Simpson's view that "all of his music is vocal in origin", maintaining that song-writing strongly influenced Nielsen's development as a composer.

The Danish sociologist Benedikte Brincker observes that the perception of Nielsen and his music in his home country is rather different from his international appreciation. His interest and background in folk music had special resonance for Danes, and this was intensified during the nationalistic movements of the 1930s and during World War II, when singing was an important basis for the Danes to distinguish themselves from their German enemies. Nielsen's songs retain an important place in Danish culture and education. The musicologist Niels Krabbe describes the popular image of Nielsen in Denmark as being like "the ugly duckling syndrome" – a reference to the tale of the Danish writer <a href="Hans%20Christian%20Andersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a> – whereby "a poor boy ... passing through adversity and frugality ... marches into Copenhagen and ... comes to conquer the position as the uncrowned King". Thus while outside Denmark Nielsen is largely thought of as the composer of orchestral music and the opera "Maskarade", in his own country he is more of a national symbol. These two sides were officially brought together in Denmark in 2006 when the Ministry of Culture issued a list of the twelve greatest Danish musical works, which included three by Nielsen – "Maskarade", the Fourth Symphony, and a pair of his Danish songs. Krabbe asks the rhetorical question: "Can 'the national' in Nielsen be demonstrated in the music in the form of particular themes, harmonies, sounds, forms, etc., or is it a pure construct of reception history?"

Nielsen himself was ambiguous about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He wrote to the Dutch composer <a href="Julius%20R%C3%B6ntgen">Julius Röntgen</a> in 1909 "I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. What do you think about songs sung in <a href="unison">unison</a>? We must go back ... to the pure and the clear." On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 "Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does ... and it is impossible to deliver national music on request."

Nielsen studied Renaissance <a href="polyphony">polyphony</a> closely, which accounts for some of the melodic and harmonic content of his music. This interest is exemplified in his "<a href="Tre%20Motetter">Tre Motetter</a>" (Three Motets, Op. 55). To non-Danish critics, Nielsen's music initially had a <a href="Neoclassicism%20%28music%29">neo-classical</a> sound but became increasingly modern as he developed his own approach to what the writer and composer <a href="Robert%20Simpson%20%28composer%29">Robert Simpson</a> called progressive tonality, moving from one key to another. Typically, Nielsen's music might end in a different key from that of its commencement, sometimes as the outcome of a struggle as in his symphonies. There is debate as to how much such elements owe to his folk music activities. Some critics have referred to his rhythms, his use of <a href="acciaccatura">acciaccatura</a>s or <a href="appoggiatura">appoggiatura</a>s, or his frequent use of a <a href="flattened%20seventh">flattened seventh</a> and <a href="minor%20third">minor third</a> in his works, as being typically Danish. The composer himself wrote "The <a href="interval%20%28music%29">intervals</a>, as I see it, are the elements which first arouse a deeper interest in music ... [I]t is intervals which surprise and delight us anew every time we hear the cuckoo in spring. Its appeal would be less if its call were all on one note."

Nielsen's philosophy of music style is perhaps summed up in his advice in a 1907 letter to the Norwegian composer Knut Harder: "You have ... fluency, so far, so good; but I advise you again and again, my dear Mr. Harder; "Tonality, Clarity, Strength".

Nielsen is perhaps most closely associated outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works have much in common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are a key component of the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Nielsen%29">Symphony No. 1</a> (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Nielsen%29">Symphony No. 2</a> (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the <a href="four%20humours">four temperaments</a> (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic, and sanguine).

The title of Symphony No. 3, "<a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Nielsen%29">Sinfonia Espansiva</a>" (Op. 27, 1910–11), is understood by the English composer Robert Simpson to refer to the "outward growth of the mind's scope". It fully exploits Nielsen's technique of confronting two keys at the same time and includes a peaceful section with soprano and baritone voices, singing a tune without words. <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Nielsen%29">Symphony No. 4</a>, "The Inextinguishable" (Op. 29, 1914–16), written during World War I, is among the most frequently performed of the symphonies. In the last movement two sets of <a href="timpani">timpani</a> are placed on opposite sides of the stage undertaking a kind of musical duel. Nielsen described the symphony as "the life force, the unquenchable will to live".

Also frequently performed is the <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Nielsen%29">Symphony No. 5</a> (Op. 50, 1921–22), presenting another battle between the forces of order and chaos. A <a href="snare%20drum">snare drum</a>mer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the <a href="Danish%20Radio%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra</a> conducted by <a href="Erik%20Tuxen">Erik Tuxen</a> at the 1950 <a href="Edinburgh%20International%20Festival">Edinburgh International Festival</a>, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Nielsen%29">Symphony No. 6</a> (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled "Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony)", the tonal language seems similar to that in Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.

Nielsen's two operas are very different in style. The four-act (Saul and David), written in 1902 to a libretto by <a href="Einar%20Christiansen">Einar Christiansen</a>, tells the <a href="Bible">Biblical</a> story of <a href="Saul">Saul</a>'s jealousy of the young <a href="David">David</a> while (Masquerade) is a comic opera in three acts written in 1906 to a Danish <a href="libretto">libretto</a> by <a href="Vilhelm%20Andersen">Vilhelm Andersen</a>, based on the comedy by <a href="Ludvig%20Holberg">Ludvig Holberg</a>. "Saul and David" received a negative press when it was premiered in November 1902 and did no better when it was revived in 1904. By contrast, in November 1906 "Masquerade" was a resounding success with an exceptional run of 25 performances over its first four months. Generally considered to be Denmark's national opera, in its home country it has enjoyed lasting success and popularity, attributable to its many <a href="Strophic%20form">strophic</a> songs, its dances and its underlying "old Copenhagen" atmosphere.

Nielsen wrote a considerable number of choral works but most of them were composed for special occasions and were seldom reprised. Three fully-fledged cantatas for soloists, orchestra and choir have, however, entered the repertoire. Nielsen composed ("Hymn of Love"), Op. 12 (1897) after studying early polyphonic choral style. Writing in the newspaper "Dannebrog", Nanna Liebmann referred to the work as "a decisive victory" for Nielsen, and Angul Hammerich of "<a href="Nationaltidende">Nationaltidende</a>" welcomed its improved clarity and purity. But the reviewer H.W. Schytte thought Nielsen had been pretentious presenting the lyrics in Latin rather than Danish. ("The Sleep"), Op. 18, Nielsen's second major choral work, sets to music the various phases of sleep including the terror of a nightmare in its central movement which, with its unusual discords, came as a shock to the reviewers at its premiere in March 1905. ("Springtime on Funen"), Op. 42, completed in 1922, has been cited as the most Danish of all Nielsen's compositions as it extols the beauty of Funen's countryside.

Nielsen wrote three concertos: the Violin Concerto, Op. 33 is a middle-period work, from 1911, which lies within the tradition of European classicism, whereas the Flute Concerto (without opus number) of 1926 and the Clarinet Concerto, Op. 57 which followed in 1928 are late works, influenced by the modernism of the 1920s and, according to the Danish musicologist Herbert Rosenberg, the product of "an extremely experienced composer who knows how to avoid inessentials." Unlike Nielsen's later works, the Violin Concerto has a distinct, melody-oriented neo-classical structure. The Flute Concerto, in two movements, was written for the flautist <a href="Holger%20Gilbert-Jespersen">Holger Gilbert-Jespersen</a>, a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet which had premiered Nielsen's Wind Quintet (1922). In contrast to the rather traditional style of the Violin Concerto, it reflects the modernistic trends of the period. The first movement, for example, switches between <a href="D%20minor">D minor</a>, <a href="E-flat%20minor">E-flat minor</a> and <a href="F%20major">F major</a> before the flute comes to the fore with a <a href="cantabile">cantabile</a> theme in <a href="E%20major">E major</a>. The Clarinet Concerto was also written for a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet, <a href="Aage%20Oxenvad">Aage Oxenvad</a>. Nielsen stretches the capacities of instrument and player to the utmost; the concerto has just one continuous movement and contains a struggle between the soloist and the orchestra and between the two principal competing keys, F major and E major.

The wind concertos present many examples of what Nielsen called ("objectification"). By this term he meant giving instrumentalists freedom of interpretation and performance within the bounds set out by the <a href="Sheet%20music">score</a>.

Nielsen's earliest work composed specifically for orchestra was the immediately successful Suite for Strings (1888), which evoked Scandinavian Romanticism as expressed by Grieg and Svendsen. The work marked an important milestone in Nielsen's career as it was not only his first real success but it was also the first of his pieces he conducted himself when it was played in Odense a month later.

The "<a href="Helios%20Overture">Helios Overture</a>", Op. 17 (1903) stems from Nielsen's stay in Athens which inspired him to compose a work depicting the sun rising and setting over the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. The score is a showpiece for orchestra, and has been amongst Nielsen's most popular works. ("Saga Dream"), Op. 39 (1907–08) is a <a href="symphonic%20poem">tone poem</a> for orchestra based on the Icelandic <a href="Nj%C3%A1l%27s%20saga">Njal's Saga</a>. In Nielsen's words:
There are among other things four cadenzas for oboe, clarinet, bassoon and flute which run quite freely alongside one another, with no harmonic connection, and without my marking time. They are just like four streams of thought, each going its own way – differently and randomly for each performance – until they meet in a point of rest, as if flowing into a lock where they are united.

"<a href="At%20the%20Bier%20of%20a%20Young%20Artist">At the Bier of a Young Artist</a>" () for string orchestra was written for the funeral of the Danish painter <a href="Oluf%20Hartmann">Oluf Hartmann</a> in January 1910 and was also played at Nielsen's own funeral. "<a href="Pan%20and%20Syrinx">Pan and Syrinx</a>" (), a vigorous nine-minute symphonic poem inspired by <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>", was premiered in 1911. The Rhapsodic Overture, "<a href="An%20Imaginary%20Trip%20to%20the%20Faroe%20Islands">An Imaginary Trip to the Faroe Islands</a>" (), draws on <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroese</a> folk tunes but also contains freely composed sections.

Among Nielsen's orchestral works for the stage are "<a href="Aladdin%20%28Nielsen%29">Aladdin</a>" (1919) and (The Mother), Op. 41 (1920). "Aladdin" was written to accompany a production of <a href="Adam%20Oehlenschl%C3%A4ger">Adam Oehlenschläger</a>'s fairy tale at The Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. The complete score, lasting over 80 minutes, is Nielsen's longest work apart from his operas, but a shorter orchestral suite consisting of the "Oriental March", "Hindu Dance" and "Negro Dance" is often performed. , written to celebrate the reunification of <a href="Southern%20Jutland">Southern Jutland</a> with Denmark, was first performed in 1921; it is a setting of patriotic verses written for the occasion.

Nielsen composed several <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a> works, some of them still high on the international repertoire. The Wind Quintet, one of his most popular pieces, was composed in 1922 specifically for the Copenhagen Wind Quintet. Simpson, explaining that Nielsen's fondness of wind instruments was closely related to his love of nature, writes: "He was also intensely interested in human character, and in the Wind Quintet composed deliberately for five friends; each part is cunningly made to suit the individuality of each player."
Nielsen wrote four string quartets. The <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%201%20%28Nielsen%29">First String Quartet No. 1 in G minor</a>, Op. 13 (1889, revised 1900) contains a "Résumé" section in the finale, bringing together themes from the first, third and fourth movements. The <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%202%20%28Nielsen%29">Second String Quartet No. 2 in F minor</a>, Op. 5 appeared in 1890 and the <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%203%20%28Nielsen%29">Third String Quartet in E-flat major</a>, Op. 14 in 1898. The music historian Jan Smaczny suggests that in this work "the handling of texture is confident and far less derivative than in earlier works ... [the quartet] prompts the most regret that Nielsen did not pursue the genre further ... to parallel his later symphonic development". The <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%204%20%28Nielsen%29">Fourth String Quartet in F major</a> (1904) initially received a mixed reception, with critics uncertain about its reserved style. Nielsen revised it several times, the final version in 1919 being listed as his Op. 44.

The violin was Nielsen's own instrument and he composed four large-scale chamber works for it. The departures from standard procedures in the First Sonata, Op. 9 (1895), including its often sudden <a href="modulation%20%28music%29">modulations</a> and its terse thematic material, disconcerted Danish critics at its first performance. The Second Sonata, Op. 35 of 1912 was written for the violinist <a href="Peder%20M%C3%B8ller%20%28violinist%29">Peder Møller</a> who earlier that year had premiered the composer's Violin Concerto. The work is an example of the composer's progressive tonality since, although it is stated to be in the key of G minor, the first and final movements end in different keys. The critic <a href="Emilius%20Bangert">Emilius Bangert</a> wrote of the premiere (which was given by <a href="Axel%20Gade">Axel Gade</a>), "The overall impression was of a beautiful, unbroken line – a flow of notes – where in particular a wonderful second subject in the first part and the pure, high sphere of the last part were captivating". Two other works are for violin solo. The "Prelude, Theme and Variations", Op. 48 (1923) was written for Telmányi, and, like Nielsen's "<a href="Chaconne%20%28Nielsen%29">Chaconne</a>" for piano, Op. 32, was inspired by the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. The "Preludio e Presto", Op. 52 (1928) was written as a tribute for the sixtieth birthday of the composer <a href="Fini%20Henriques">Fini Henriques</a>.

Although Nielsen came to compose mainly at the piano, he only composed directly for it occasionally over a period of 40 years, creating works often with a distinctive style which slowed their international acceptance. Nielsen's own piano technique, an echo of which is probably preserved in three <a href="wax%20cylinders">wax cylinders</a> marked "Carl Nielsen" at the State Archives in <a href="Aarhus">Aarhus</a>, seems to have been mediocre. Reviewing the 1969 recording of works by the pianist <a href="John%20Ogdon">John Ogdon</a>, John Horton commented on the early pieces: "Nielsen's technical resources hardly measure up to the grandeur of his designs", whilst characterising the later pieces as "major works which can stand comparison with his symphonic music". The anti-romantic tone of the "Symphonic Suite", Op. 8 (1894) was described by a later critic as "nothing less than a clenched fist straight in the face of all established musical convention". In Nielsen's words, the "Chaconne", Op. 32 (1917) was "a really big piece, and I think effective". It is not only inspired by the work of Bach, especially the <a href="Partita%20for%20Violin%20No.%202%20%28Bach%29%23The%20Ciaccona">chaconne for solo violin</a>, but also by the virtuoso piano arrangements of Bach's music by composers such as <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert Schumann</a>, Johannes Brahms and Ferruccio Busoni. Also on a large scale, and from the same year, is the "Theme and Variations", Op. 41, in which critics have discerned the influences of Brahms and also of <a href="Max%20Reger">Max Reger</a>, of whom Nielsen had earlier written to a friend "I think that the public will be utterly unable to grasp Reger's work and yet I am a lot more sympathetic towards his efforts than towards ... <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>".

All Nielsen's organ works were late compositions. The Danish organist <a href="Finn%20Vider%C3%B8">Finn Viderø</a> suggests that his interest was prompted by the (<a href="Organ%20reform%20movement">Organ reform movement</a>), and the renewal of the front pipes of the <a href="Schnitger%20organ%20%28Hamburg%29">Schnitger organ</a> in the <a href="St.%20Jacobi%2C%20Hamburg">St. Jacobi Church</a>, Hamburg, from 1928 to 1930. Nielsen's last major work – , Op. 58, a 22-minute piece for organ – was composed between June 1930 and February 1931, only a few months before his death.

Over the years, Nielsen wrote the music for over 290 <a href="List%20of%20songs%20composed%20by%20Carl%20Nielsen">songs and hymns</a>, most of them for verses and poems by well-known Danish authors such as N. F. S. Grundtvig, <a href="Bernhard%20Severin%20Ingemann">Ingemann</a>, Poul Martin Møller, Adam Oehlenschläger and Jeppe Aakjær. In Denmark, many of them are still popular today both with adults and children. They are regarded as "the most representative part of the country's most representative composer's output". In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, <a href="Christian%20Winther">Christian Winther</a> or <a href="Holger%20Drachmann">Drachmann</a>, and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music. But it is also clear that a foreigner, who knows neither our countryside, nor our painters, our poets, or our history in the same intimate way as we do ourselves, will be completely unable to grasp what it is that brings us to hear and tremble with sympathetic understanding.

Of great significance was Nielsen's contribution to the 1922 publication, " Folkehøjskolens Melodibog (The Folk High School Songbook)", of which he was one of the editors together with <a href="Thomas%20Laub">Thomas Laub</a>, <a href="Oluf%20Ring">Oluf Ring</a> and <a href="Thorvald%20Aagaard">Thorvald Aagaard</a>. The book contained about 600 melodies, of which about 200 were composed by the editors, and was intended to provide a repertoire for <a href="Sing-along">communal singing</a>, an integral part of Danish folk culture. The collection was extremely popular and became embedded in the Danish educational system. During the <a href="Denmark%20in%20World%20War%20II">German occupation of Denmark</a> in World War II, mass song gatherings, using these melodies, were part of Denmark's "spiritual re-armament", and after the war in 1945 Nielsen's contributions were characterised by one writer as "shining jewels in our treasure-chest of patriotic songs". This remains a significant factor in Danish assessment of the composer.

Between 1994 and 2009 a complete new edition of Nielsen's works, the "Carl Nielsen Edition", was commissioned by the Danish Government (at a cost of over 40 million kroner). For many of the works, including the operas "Maskarade" and "Saul and David", and the complete "Aladdin" music, this was their first printed publication, copies of manuscripts having previously been used in performances. The scores are now all available for download free of charge at the website of the Danish Royal Library (which also owns most of Nielsen's music manuscripts).

Unlike that of his contemporary, the Finn Jean Sibelius, Nielsen's reputation abroad did not start to evolve until after World War II. For some time, international interest was largely directed towards his symphonies while his other works, many of them highly popular in Denmark, have only recently started to become part of the world repertoire. Even in Denmark, many of his compositions failed to impress. It was only in 1897 after the first performance of "Hymnus amoris" that he received support from the critics, to be substantially reinforced in 1906 by their enthusiastic reception of "Masquerade".

Within two months of its successful premiere at the Odd Fellows Concert Hall in Copenhagen on 28 February 1912, the Third Symphony ("Espansiva)" was in the repertoire of the <a href="Royal%20Concertgebouw%20Orchestra">Amsterdam Concertgebouw</a>, and by 1913 it had seen performances in Stuttgart, Stockholm and Helsinki. The symphony was the most popular of all Nielsen's works during his lifetime and was also played in Berlin, Hamburg, London and Gothenburg. Other works caused some uncertainty, even in Denmark. After the premiere of the Fifth Symphony (1922) one critic wrote: "The treasure of Danish symphonies and Carl Nielsen's own output have been enriched by a strange and highly original work." Another, however, described it as a "bloody, clenched fist in the face of an unsuspecting snob audience", also qualifying it as "filthy music from trenches".

At the end of the 1940s two major biographies of Nielsen appeared in Danish, dominating opinion of the composer's life and work for several decades. Robert Simpson's book "Carl Nielsen, Symphonist" (first edition 1952) was the earliest large-scale study in English.

An international breakthrough came in 1962 when Leonard Bernstein recorded the Fifth Symphony with the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">New York Philharmonic Orchestra</a> for CBS. The recording helped Nielsen's music to achieve appreciation beyond his home country and is considered one of the finest recorded accounts of the symphony. Nielsen's centenary in 1965 was widely celebrated, both in terms of performances and publications, and Bernstein was awarded the <a href="L%C3%A9onie%20Sonning%20Music%20Prize">Sonning Prize</a> for his recording of the Third Symphony. In 1988 Nielsen's diaries and his letters to Anne Marie were published, and these, together with a 1991 biography by Jørgen Jensen using this new material, led to a revised objective assessment of the composer's personality. Writing in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" on the occasion of Nielsen's 125th anniversary in 1990, the music critic Andrew Pincus recalled that 25 years earlier Bernstein had believed the world was ready to accept the Dane as the equal of Jean Sibelius, speaking of "his rough charm, his swing, his drive, his rhythmic surprises, his strange power of harmonic and tonal relationships – and especially his constant unpredictability" (which Pincus believed was still a challenge for audiences). Biographies and studies in English in the 1990s helped to establish Nielsen's status worldwide, to the point at which his music has become a regular feature of concert programming in Western countries.

Writing in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" in 2008, the American music critic <a href="Alex%20Ross">Alex Ross</a> compares the "brute strength" of Nielsen's symphonies to <a href="Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s "<a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Beethoven%29">Eroica</a>" and <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Beethoven%29">Fifth Symphony</a> but explains that only now were the Americans slowly beginning to appreciate the Danish composer. In particular, he compliments <a href="Alan%20Gilbert%20%28conductor%29">Alan Gilbert</a> on his understanding and interpretations of the Nielsen symphonies.

Nielsen did not record any of his works. However, three younger contemporary conductors who had worked with him, <a href="Thomas%20Jensen">Thomas Jensen</a>, <a href="Launy%20Gr%C3%B8ndahl">Launy Grøndahl</a>, and Erik Tuxen, did record his symphonies and other orchestral works with the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra between 1946 and 1952. Jensen also made the first <a href="LP%20record">LP record</a>ing of the Fifth Symphony in 1954. Work carried out by the recently published complete "Carl Nielsen Edition" has revealed that the scores used in these recordings often differ from the composer's original intentions and thus the supposed authenticity of these recordings is now debatable.

There are now numerous recordings of all Nielsen's major works, including complete cycles of the symphonies conducted by, amongst others, <a href="Colin%20Davis">Sir Colin Davis</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Blomstedt">Herbert Blomstedt</a> and <a href="Sakari%20Oramo">Sakari Oramo</a>. Over 50 recordings have been made of Nielsen's Wind Quintet. In January 2015, the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a> conducted by Alan Gilbert completed recordings of Nielsen's six symphonies and three concertos. Anthony Tommasini of "The New York Times" qualified the CD of Symphonies Nos. 2 and 3 as "terrific" in the newspaper's list of the best classical music recordings of 2012.

From 1916, Nielsen taught at the Royal Academy where he became director in 1931, shortly before his death. He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, <a href="Harald%20Agersnap">Harald Agersnap</a>, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and <a href="J%C3%B8rgen%20Bentzon">Jørgen Bentzon</a> who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist <a href="Knud%20Jeppesen">Knud Jeppesen</a>, the pianist <a href="Herman%20David%20Koppel">Herman Koppel</a>, the academy professor and symphony composer <a href="Poul%20Schierbeck">Poul Schierbeck</a>, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at <a href="Roskilde%20Cathedral">Roskilde Cathedral</a>, and <a href="Nancy%20Dalberg">Nancy Dalberg</a>, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of "Aladdin". Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster <a href="Mogens%20W%C3%B6ldike">Mogens Wöldike</a>, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and <a href="Rudolph%20Simonsen">Rudolph Simonsen</a>, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.

The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings.
The Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the <a href="Odense%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Odense Symphony Orchestra</a>. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued. An international Organ Competition, founded by the city of Odense, became associated with the Nielsen competition in 2009, but from 2015 will be organized separately, based in Odense Cathedral.

In his home country, the Carl Nielsen Museum, in Odense, is dedicated to Nielsen and his wife, Anne Marie. The composer is featured on the <a href="Banknotes%20of%20Denmark%2C%201997%20series%23The%20100%20kroner%20note">100 kroner note</a> issued by the <a href="Danmarks%20Nationalbank">Danish National Bank</a> from 1997 to 2010. His image was selected in recognition of his contribution to Danish music compositions such as his opera "Maskarade", his "Espansiva" symphony and his many songs including "Danmark, nu blunder den lyse nat".

Several special events were scheduled on or around 9 June 2015 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Nielsen's birth. In addition to many performances in Denmark, concerts were programmed in cities across Europe, including London, Leipzig, Kraków, Gothenburg, Helsinki and Vienna, and even further afield in Japan, Egypt and New York. For 9 June, Nielsen's birthday, the Danish National Symphony Orchestra presented a programme in Copenhagen's <a href="Koncerthuset">DR Concert Hall</a> featuring "Hymnus amoris", the "Clarinet Concerto" and "Symphony No. 4" for a broadcast extending across Europe and the United States. The <a href="Danish%20Royal%20Opera">Danish Royal Opera</a> has programmed "Maskarade" and a new production (directed by David Pountney) of "Saul og David". During 2015, the <a href="Danish%20Quartet">Danish Quartet</a> scheduled performances of Nielsen's string quartets in Denmark, Israel, Germany, Norway and the UK (at the <a href="Cheltenham%20Music%20Festival">Cheltenham Music Festival</a>). In the UK, the <a href="BBC%20Philharmonic">BBC Philharmonic</a> prepared a concert series on Nielsen beginning on 9 June in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. Nielsen's "Maskarade" overture was also the first item for the opening night of the 2015 <a href="BBC%20Promenade%20Concerts">BBC Promenade Concerts</a> in London, while his compositions featured in five other concerts of the Prom season. The city of Odense, which has strong connections with Nielsen, developed an extensive programme of concerts and cultural events for the anniversary year.

Theramenes

Theramenes (; ; died 404 BC) was an <a href="Classical%20Athens">Athenian</a> statesman, prominent in the final decade of the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a>. He was particularly active during the two periods of <a href="Oligarchy">oligarchic</a> government at Athens, as well as in the trial of the generals who had commanded at <a href="Battle%20of%20Arginusae">Arginusae</a> in 406 BC. A moderate <a href="oligarchy">oligarch</a>, he often found himself caught between the democrats on the one hand and the extremist oligarchs on the other. Successful in replacing a narrow oligarchy with a broader one in 411 BC, he failed to achieve the same end in 404 BC, and was executed by the extremists whose policies he had opposed.

Theramenes was a central figure in four major episodes of Athenian history. He appeared on the scene in 411 BC as one of the leaders of an oligarchic <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a>, but, as his views and those of the coup's other leaders diverged, he began to oppose their dictates and took the lead in replacing the narrow oligarchy they had imposed with a more broadly based one. He served as a general for several years after this, but was not reelected to that office in 407 BC. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arginusae">Battle of Arginusae</a>, in which he served as a <a href="trierarch">trierarch</a>, he was assigned to rescue Athenian sailors from sinking ships, but was prevented from doing so by a storm. That incident prompted a massive furore at Athens, in which Theramenes had to exonerate himself from responsibility for the failed rescue; the controversy ended in the execution of six generals who had commanded at that battle. After the Athenian defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Aegospotami">Aegospotami</a> in 405 BC, Theramenes arranged the terms by which Athens surrendered to Sparta. He then became a member of the narrow oligarchic government, known as the <a href="Thirty%20Tyrants">Thirty Tyrants</a>, that Sparta imposed on its defeated rival. As he had in 411 BC, Theramenes soon came into conflict with the more extreme members of that government; his protests against the reign of terror the Thirty implemented led the leading oligarchs to plot his demise; he was denounced before the oligarchic assembly, and then, when that body appeared reluctant to punish him, struck him from the roster of citizens and executed him without trial.

Theramenes remained a controversial figure after his death; <a href="Lysias">Lysias</a> vigorously denounced him while prosecuting several of his former political allies, but others defended his actions. Modern historical assessments have shifted over time; in the 19th century, Theramenes's part in the coup of 411 BC and his use of Arginusae were widely condemned, but newly discovered ancient texts and 20th-century scholarship supported more positive assessments. Some historians have found in Theramenes a selfish opportunist, others a principled moderate. The details of his actions, his motivations, and his character continue to be debated down to the present day.

No ancient biographies of Theramenes are known, but his life and actions are relatively well documented, due to the extensive treatment given him in several surviving works. The Attic orator <a href="Lysias">Lysias</a> deals with him at length in several of his speeches, albeit in a very hostile manner. Theramenes also appears in several ancient narrative histories: <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>' account includes the beginnings of Theramenes' career, and <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>, picking up where Thucydides left off, gives a detailed account of several episodes from Theramenes career; <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a>, probably drawing his account from <a href="Ephorus">Ephorus</a> at most points, provides another account that varies widely from Xenophon's at several points. Theramenes also appears in several other sources, which, although they do not provide as many narrative details, have been used to illuminate the political disputes which surrounded Theramenes' life and memory.

Only the barest outlines of Theramenes' life outside the public sphere have been preserved in the historical record. His father, <a href="Hagnon%2C%20son%20of%20Nikias">Hagnon</a> had played a significant role in Athenian public life in the decades before Theramenes' appearance on the scene. He had commanded the group of Greek colonists who founded <a href="Amphipolis">Amphipolis</a> in 437–6 BC, had served as a general on several occasions before and during the Peloponnesian War, and was one of the signers of the <a href="Peace%20of%20Nicias">Peace of Nicias</a>. Hagnon's career overlapped with his son's when he served as one of the ten commissioners appointed by the government of <a href="The%20Four%20Hundred%20%28oligarchy%29">the 400</a> to draft a new constitution in 411 BC.

Theramenes' first appearance in the historical record comes with his involvement in the oligarchic coup of 411 BC. In the wake of the Athenian defeat in Sicily, revolts began to break out among Athens' subject states in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> and the Peace of Nicias fell apart; the Peloponnesian War resumed in full by 412 BC. In this context, a number of Athenian aristocrats, led by <a href="Peisander%20%28Athenian%29">Peisander</a> and with Theramenes prominent among their ranks, began to conspire to overthrow the city's democratic government. This intrigue was initiated by the exiled nobleman <a href="Alcibiades">Alcibiades</a>, who was at that time acting as an assistant to the <a href="Achaemenid%20Dynasty">Persian</a> <a href="satrap">satrap</a> <a href="Tissaphernes">Tissaphernes</a>. Claiming that he had great influence with Tissaphernes, Alcibiades promised to return to Athens, bringing Persian support with him, if the democracy that had exiled him were replaced with an oligarchy. Accordingly, a number of <a href="trierarch">trierarch</a>s and other leaders of the Athenian army at <a href="Samos%20Island">Samos</a> began planning the overthrow of the democracy. They eventually dispatched Peisander to Athens, where, by promising that the return of Alcibiades and an alliance with Persia would follow if the Athenians would replace their democracy with an oligarchy, he persuaded the Athenian "<a href="ecclesia%20%28ancient%20Athens%29">ecclesia</a>" to send him as an emissary to Alcibiades, authorized to make whatever arrangements were necessary.

Alcibiades, however, did not succeed in persuading the satrap to ally with the Athenians, and, to hide this fact, demanded (claiming to be speaking for Tissaphernes) greater and greater concessions of them until they finally refused to comply. Disenchanted with Alcibiades but still determined to overthrow the democracy, Peisander and his companions returned to Samos, where the conspirators worked to secure their control over the army and encouraged a group of native Samian oligarchs to begin planning the overthrow of their own city's democracy. In Athens, meanwhile, a party of young oligarchic revolutionaries succeeded in gaining de facto control of the government through assassination and intimidation.

After making arrangements to their satisfaction at Samos the leaders of the conspiracy set sail for Athens. Among them was Theramenes; Thucydides refers to him as "one of the leaders of the party that put down the democracy—an able speaker and a man with ideas." Calling the assembly together, the conspirators proposed a series of measures by which the democracy was formally replaced with a government of <a href="The%20Four%20Hundred%20%28oligarchy%29">400</a> chosen men, who were to select and convene a larger body of 5,000 as time went on. Shortly afterwards, the conspirators went, under arms, to the council chamber, where they ordered the democratic council to disperse after collecting their pay; the council did as ordered, and from this point forward the mechanism of government was fully under the control of the oligarchic conspirators; they quickly changed the laws to reflect the new form of government they had imposed.
At this point, several conflicts began to develop that threatened the future of the new government at Athens. First, the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one <a href="Aristocrates%20%28oligarch%29">Aristocrates</a> son of Scelias as the leader of the moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by <a href="Phrynicus%20%28oligarch%29">Phrynicus</a>, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and <a href="Antiphon%20%28person%29%23Antiphon%20of%20Rhamnus">Antiphon</a>, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens' power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of <a href="hoplite">hoplite</a> status or higher.

Shortly after taking power, the extremist leaders of the revolution had begun constructing fortifications on Eetioneia, a dominant point in the entrance to the harbor of <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, ostensibly to protect the harbor against an attack from the fleet at Samos. With internal dissent increasing, they joined these new fortifications to existing walls to form a redoubt defensible against attacks from land or sea, which contained a large warehouse into which the extremists moved most of the city's grain supply. Theramenes protested strongly against the building of this fortification, arguing that its purpose was not to keep the democrats out, but to be handed over to the Spartans; Thucydides testifies that his charges were not without substance, as the extremists were actually contemplating such an action. Initially cautious (as enemies of the regime had been executed before), Theramenes and his party were emboldened and galvanized into action by several events. First, a <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnesian</a> fleet, ostensibly dispatched to assist anti-Athenian forces on <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a>, was moving slowly up the coast of the Peloponnese; Theramenes charged that this fleet was planning to seize the fortifications on Eetioneia, in collaboration with the extremists. Second, an Athenian militiaman, apparently acting on orders from conspirators higher in the ranks of the government, assassinated Phrynichus, the leader of the extremist faction. He escaped, but his accomplice, an <a href="Argos">Argive</a>, was captured; the prisoner, under torture, refused to state the name of his employer. With the extremists unable to take effective action in this case, and with the Peloponnesian fleet overrunning <a href="Aegina">Aegina</a> (a logical stopping point on the approach to Piraeus), Theramenes and his party decided to act.

Aristocrates, who was commanding a regiment of hoplites in Piraeus, arrested the extremist general <a href="Alexicles%20%28general%29">Alexicles</a>; enraged, the extremist leaders of the 400 demanded action, and made a number of threats against Theramenes and his party. To their surprise, Theramenes volunteered to lead a force to rescue Alexicles; the leaders of the extremists acquiesced, and Theramenes set out to Piraeus, sharing his command with one other moderate and one extremist, Aristarchus. When Theramenes and his force arrived at Piraeus, Aristarchus, in a rage, exhorted the men to attack the hoplites who had seized Alexicles. Theramenes feigned rage as well, but when asked by the hoplites whether he thought that the fortification on Eetioneia was a good idea, he responded that if they wanted to pull it down, he thought that would be good. Calling out that everyone who wanted the 5,000 to govern instead of the 400, the hoplites set to work. Donald Kagan has suggested that this call was probably instigated by Theramenes' party, who wanted the 5,000 to govern; the hoplites tearing down the fortification might well have preferred a return to the democracy. Several days later, the Peloponnesian fleet approached Piraeus, but, finding the fortifications destroyed and the port well defended, they sailed on to Euboea. Several days later, the 400 were formally deposed and replaced by a government of the 5,000; the most extreme of the oligarchs fled the city.

Under the government of the 5,000 and under the democracy that replaced it in 410 BC, Theramenes served as a general for several years, commanding fleets in the Aegean Sea and the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>. Shortly after the rise of the government of the 5,000, Theramenes set sail to the Hellespont to join <a href="Thrasybulus">Thrasybulus</a> and the generals elected by the army at Samos. After the Athenian victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Abydos">Abydos</a>, he took thirty <a href="triremes">triremes</a> to attack the rebels on Euboea, who were building a causeway to <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a> to provide land access to their island. Unable to stop the construction, he plundered the territory of several rebellious cities, then travelled around the Aegean suppressing oligarchies and raising funds from various cities of the Athenian Empire. He then took his fleet to <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>, where he assisted the Macedonian king <a href="Archelaus%20I%20of%20Macedon">Archelaus</a> in his siege of <a href="Pydna">Pydna</a>, but, with that siege dragging on, he sailed on to join Thrasybulus in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>. The fleet soon moved on from there to challenge <a href="Mindarus">Mindarus</a>' fleet, which had seized the city of <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a>. Theramenes commanded one wing of the Athenian fleet in the resulting <a href="Battle%20of%20Cyzicus">Battle of Cyzicus</a>, a decisive Athenian victory. In that battle, Alcibiades (who had been recalled from exile by the fleet at Samos shortly after the coup) led a decoy force that drew the Spartan fleet out into open water, while Thrasybulus and Theramenes, each commanding an independent squadron, cut off the Spartans' retreat. Mindarus was forced to flee to a nearby beach, and vicious fighting ensued on land as the Athenians attempted to drag off the Spartan ships. Thrasybulus and Alcibiades kept the Spartans occupied while Theramenes joined up with the nearby Athenian land forces and then hurried to the rescue; his arrival precipitated a total Athenian victory, in which all the Spartan ships were captured. In the wake of this victory, the Athenians captured Cyzicus and constructed a fort at <a href="%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar%23Chrysopolis">Chrysopolis</a>, from which they extracted a customs duty of one tenth on all ships passing through the <a href="Bosporus">Bosporus</a>. Theramenes and another general remained at this fort with a garrison of thirty ships to oversee the collection of the duty. At Athens, meanwhile, the government of the 5,000 was replaced by a restored democracy within a few months of this battle; Donald Kagan has suggested that the absence of Theramenes, "the best spokesman for the moderates", paved the way for this restoration.

According to Diodorus and <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, Theramenes participated under the command of Alcibiades to the siege of <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> (408 BC), winning the battle against the Peloponnesian army that was appointed to defend that city: Alcibiades was in command of the right wing, while Theramenes was in charge of the left one.

Theramenes remained a general through 407 BC, but, in that year, when the Athenian defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Notium">Notium</a> led to the downfall of Alcibiades and his political allies, Theramenes was not reelected. In the next year, however, he did sail as a trierarch in the scratch Athenian relief fleet sent out to relieve <a href="Conon">Conon</a>, who had been blockaded with 40 triremes at <a href="Mytilene">Mytilene</a> by <a href="Callicratidas">Callicratidas</a>. That relief force won a surprising victory over the more experienced Spartan force in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arginusae">Battle of Arginusae</a>, but in the wake of that battle Theramenes found himself in the middle of a massive controversy. At the end of the battle, the generals in command of the fleet had conferred to decide on their next steps. Several pressing concerns presented themselves; 50 Peloponnesian ships under <a href="Eteonicus">Eteonicus</a> remained at Mytilene, blockading Conon, and decisive action by the Athenians could lead to the destruction of that force as well, but, at the same time, ships needed to be dispatched to recover the sailors of the twenty five Athenian triremes sunk or disabled in the battle. Accordingly, all eight generals, with the larger part of the fleet, set out for Mytilene, while a rescue force under Thrasybulus and Theramenes, both of whom were trierarchs in this battle but had served as generals in prior campaigns, remained behind to pick up the survivors and retrieve corpses for burial. At this point, however, a severe storm blew up, and both of these forces were driven back to shore. Eteonicus escaped, and a great number of Athenian sailors—estimates as to the precise figure have ranged from near 1,000 to as many as 5,000—drowned.

Soon after the news of this public tragedy reached Athens, a massive controversy erupted over the apportionment of blame for the botched rescue. The public was furious over the loss of so many sailors, and over the failure to recover the bodies of the dead for burial, and the generals suspected that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to Athens, might have been responsible for stirring up the assembly against them, and wrote letters to the people denouncing the two trierarchs as responsible for the failed rescue. Thrasybulus and Theramenes were called before the assembly to defend their behavior; in their defense, Theramenes produced a letter from the generals in which they blamed only the storm for the mishap; the trierarchs were exonerated, and public anger now turned against the generals. All eight were deposed from office, and summoned back to Athens to stand trial. Two fled, but six returned as commanded to face the charges against them.

Diodorus notes that the generals committed a critical error by attempting to shift the blame onto Theramenes. "For," he states, "although they could have had the help of Theramenes and his associates in the trial, men who both were able orators and had many friends and, most important of all, had been participants in the events relative to the battle, they had them, on the contrary, as adversaries and bitter accusers." When the trial came, Theramenes' numerous political allies were among the leaders of the faction seeking the generals' conviction. A bitter series of debates and legal maneuvers ensued as the assembly fought over what to do with the generals. At first, it appeared that they might be treated leniently, but in the end, public displays of bereavement by the families of the deceased and aggressive prosecution by a politician named <a href="Callixenus">Callixenus</a> swung the opinion of the assembly; the six generals were tried as a group and executed. The Athenian public, as the grief and anger prompted by the disaster cooled, came to regret their action, and for thousands of years historians and commentators have pointed to the incident as perhaps the greatest miscarriage of justice the city's government ever perpetrated.

In 405 BC, the Athenian navy was defeated and destroyed by the Peloponnesian fleet under <a href="Lysander">Lysander</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aegospotami">Battle of Aegospotami</a> in the Hellespont. Without sufficient funds to build another fleet, the Athenians could only wait as Lysander sailed westward across the Aegean towards their city. Blockaded by land and sea, with their food supplies running low, the Athenians sent ambassadors to the Spartan king <a href="Agis%20II">Agis</a>, whose army was camped outside their walls, offering to join the Spartan alliance if they were allowed to keep their walls and port; Agis, claiming that he had no power to negotiate, sent the ambassadors on to Sparta, but there they were told that, if they really wanted peace, they should bring the Spartans better proposals. The Athenians were initially intransigent, going so far as to imprison a man who suggested that a stretch of the <a href="long%20walls">long walls</a> be torn down as the Spartans had insisted, but the reality of their situation soon compelled them to consider compromises. In this situation, Theramenes, in a speech to the assembly, requested that he be sent as an ambassador to Lysander (who was at this time besieging Samos) to determine the Spartans' intentions towards Athens; he also stated that he had discovered something that might improve the Athenians' situation, although he declined to share it with the citizenry. His request was granted, and Theramenes sailed to Samos to meet with Lysander; from there, he was sent to Sparta, perhaps stopping at Athens on the way. At Sparta, with representatives of all of Sparta's allies present, Theramenes and his colleagues negotiated the terms of the peace that ended the Peloponnesian War; the long walls and the walls of Piraeus were pulled down, the size of the Athenian fleet was sharply limited, and Athenian foreign policy was subordinated to that of Sparta; the treaty also stipulated that the Athenians were to use "the constitution of their ancestors". Theramenes returned to Athens and presented the results of the negotiations to the assembly; although some still favored holding out, the majority voted to accept the terms; the Peloponnesian War, after 28 years, was at an end.

In the wake of Athens' surrender, the long walls were torn down and the troops besieging the city returned to their various homes; a Spartan garrison probably remained in Athens to supervise the dismantling of the walls; Lysander sailed off to Samos to complete the siege of that city. Another clause of the treaty that had ended the war had allowed all exiles to return to Athens, and these men, many of them oligarchic agitators who had been cast out by the democracy, were hard at work in the months after the treaty. Five "overseers" were appointed by the members of the oligarchic social clubs to plan the transition to an oligarchy. In July 404 BC, they summoned Lysander back to Athens, where he supervised the change of government; an oligarchic politician, Dracontides, proposed in the council to place the government in the hands of thirty chosen men; Theramenes supported this motion, and, with Lysander threatening to punish the Athenians for failing to dismantle the walls quickly enough unless they assented, it passed the assembly. Thirty men were selected: ten appointed by the "overseers", ten chosen by Theramenes (including himself), and ten picked by Lysander.

This government, which soon came to be known as the "Thirty Tyrants" for its excesses and atrocities, rapidly set about establishing its control over the city. The oligarchs, led by <a href="Critias">Critias</a>, one of the "overseers" and a former exile, summoned a Spartan garrison to ensure their safety and then initiated a reign of terror, executing any men who they thought might possess sufficient initiative or a large enough following to effectively challenge them. It was this campaign that first drove a wedge between Theramenes and the leaders of the Thirty; initially a supporter of Critias, Theramenes now argued that it was unnecessary to execute men who had shown no sign of wishing the oligarchy harm just because they had been popular under the democracy. This protest, however, failed to slow the pace of the executions, so Theramenes next argued that, if the oligarchy was to govern by force, it must at least expand its base; fearful that Theramenes might lead a popular movement against them, Critias and the leaders of the Thirty issued a list of 3,000 men who would be associates in the new government. When Theramenes again objected that this number was still too small, the leaders arranged for a military review to be staged after which the citizens were ordered to pile their arms; with the help of the Spartan garrison, the oligarchs then confiscated all arms except those belonging to the 3,000.
This, in turn, marked the beginning of even greater excesses; to pay the Spartan garrison's wages, Critias and the leaders ordered each of the Thirty to arrest and execute a <a href="metic">metic</a>, or resident alien, and confiscate his property. Theramenes, protesting that this action was worse than the worst excesses of the democracy, refused to follow the order.

Critias and his compatriots, in the light of these events, decided that Theramenes had become an intolerable threat to their rule; accordingly, speaking before the assembly of the 3,000, Critias denounced Theramenes as a born traitor, always ready to shift his political allegiances with the expediencies of the moment. Famously, he branded him with the nickname "cothurnus", the name of a boot worn on the stage that could fit either foot; Theramenes, he proclaimed, was ready to serve either the democratic or oligarchic cause, seeking only to further his own personal interest. In an impassioned response, Theramenes denied that his politics had ever been inconsistent. He had always, he insisted, favored a moderate policy, neither extreme democracy nor extreme oligarchy, and held true to the ideal of a government composed of men of hoplite status or higher, who would be able to effectively serve the state. This speech had a substantial effect on the audience, and Critias saw that, if the case were brought to a vote, Theramenes would be acquitted. Accordingly, after conferring with the Thirty, Critias ordered men with daggers to line the stage in front of the audience and then struck Theramenes' name from the roster of the 3,000, denying him his right to a trial. Theramenes, springing to a nearby altar for sanctuary, admonished the assemblage not to permit his murder, but to no avail; the Eleven, keepers of the prison, entered, dragged him away, and forced him to drink a cup of hemlock. Theramenes, imitating a <a href="kottabos">popular drinking game</a> in which the drinker toasted a loved one as he finished his cup, downed the poison and then flung the dregs to the floor, exclaiming "Here's to the health of my beloved Critias!"

Theramenes lived a controversial life, and his death did not end the struggle over how to interpret his actions. In the years after his death, his reputation became an item of contention as former associates of his defended themselves against prosecutors under the restored democracy. (The regime of the Thirty lasted only until 403 BC.) It would appear that, as they defended themselves before democratic-sympathizing Athenian jurymen, Theramenes' former comrades in the oligarchy attempted to exculpate themselves by associating their actions with those of Theramenes and portraying him as a steadfast defender of the Athenian democracy; examples of such accounts can be found in the "Histories" of Diodorus Siculus and in the "Theramenes papyrus", a fragmentary work discovered in the 1960s. An example of the sort of attack this portrayal was intended to defend against can be found in two orations of <a href="Lysias">Lysias</a>, "Against Eratosthenes" and "Against Agoratus"; there, Theramenes is portrayed as treasonous and self-interested, doing tremendous harm to the Athenian cause through his machinations. Xenophon adopts a similarly hostile attitude in the early parts of his work, but apparently had a change of heart during the chronological break in composition that divides the second book of the "Hellenica"; his portrayal of Theramenes during the reign of the Thirty Tyrants is altogether more favorable than that of his earlier years. A final portrayal is offered by <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, who, in his "<a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Athenians%20%28Aristotle%29">Constitution of the Athenians</a>", portrays Theramenes as a moderate and a model citizen; historians have disputed the origin of this account, with some treating it as a product of 4th-century BC propaganda by a moderate "Theramenean" party, while others, such as Phillip Harding, see no evidence for such a tradition and argue that Aristotle's treatment of Theramenes is entirely a product of his own reassessment of the man. <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a>, a historian active in the time of Caesar, presents a generally favorable account of Theramenes, which appears to be drawn from the noted historian <a href="Ephorus">Ephorus</a>, who studied in Athens under <a href="Isocrates">Isocrates</a> who was taught by Theramenes.

Theramenes' reputation has undergone a dramatic shift since the 19th century, when Xenophon's and Lysias' unfavorable accounts were widely accepted, and Theramenes was execrated as a turncoat and blamed for instigating the execution of the generals after Arginusae. The discovery of Aristotle's "Constitution of the Athenians" in 1890 reversed this trend for the broad assessment of Theramenes' character, and Diodorus' account of the Arginusae trial has been preferred by scholars since <a href="Antony%20Andrewes">Antony Andrewes</a> undermined Xenophon's account in the 1970s; Diodorus' more melodramatic passages, such as his elaborate presentation of Theramenes' last moments, are still discounted, but he is now preferred on a number of issues, and on the Arginusae trial in particular. <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>, in <a href="The%20Frogs">The Frogs</a>, pokes fun at Theramenes' ability to extricate himself from tight spots, but delivers none of the scathing rebukes one would expect for a politician whose role in the shocking events after Arginusae had been regarded as particularly blameworthy, and modern scholars have seen in this a more accurate depiction of how Theramenes was perceived in his time; Lysias, meanwhile, who mercilessly attacks Theramenes on many counts, has nothing negative to say about the aftermath of Arginusae.

Recent works have generally accepted the image of Theramenes as a moderate, committed to the ideal of a hoplite-based broad oligarchy. <a href="Donald%20Kagan">Donald Kagan</a> has said of him that "...his entire career reveals him to be a patriot and a true moderate, sincerely committed to a constitution granting power to the hoplite class, whether in the form of a limited democracy or a broadly based oligarchy", while John Fine has noted that "like many a person following a middle course, he was hated by both political extremes." The constitution of the 5,000 is recognized as his political masterpiece; his attempt to bring about a similar shift towards moderatism in 404 led directly to his death. That death, meanwhile, has become famous for its drama, and the story of Theramenes' final moments has been repeated over and over throughout classical historiography. "Because he met his death defying a tyrant," John Fine notes, "it is easy to idealize Theramenes." In the millennia since his death, Theramenes has been both idealized and reviled; his brief seven-year career in the spotlight, touching as it did on all the major points of controversy in the last years of the Peloponnesian War, has been subject to myriad different interpretations. From the polemical contemporary works which describe his career have emerged the outlines of a complex figure, charting a dangerous course through the chaos of the late 5th-century Athenian political scene; although historians from ancient times to the present have offered far more specific portraits, of one form or another, it may be that nothing more than that outline will ever be known with certainty.

Super Mario 64

Producer/director and Mario creator <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> conceived a 3D "Mario" game during the production of "<a href="Star%20Fox%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Star Fox</a>" (1993). "Super Mario 64" development, handled by <a href="Nintendo%20EAD">Nintendo EAD</a>, lasted approximately three years; one was spent on designing while the next two on direct work. The visuals were created using the <a href="N-World">Nichimen N-World</a> toolkit, and Miyamoto aimed to include more details than earlier games. A <a href="multiplayer">multiplayer</a> mode featuring <a href="Luigi">Luigi</a> as a playable character was planned but cut. Along with "<a href="Pilotwings%2064">Pilotwings 64</a>", "Super Mario 64" was one of the <a href="launch%20game">launch game</a>s for Nintendo 64. <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> released it in Japan on June 23, 1996, and later in North America, Europe, and Australia. A <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remake</a>, "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064%20DS">Super Mario 64 DS</a>," was released for the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> in 2004, and the original version was rereleased for Nintendo's <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> service on the <a href="Wii">Wii</a> and <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a> in 2006 and 2015, respectively.

"Super Mario 64" is acclaimed as one of the <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">greatest video games of all time</a>, and was the first game to receive a perfect score from "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" magazine. Reviewers praised its ambition, visuals, gameplay, and music, although they criticized its unreliable <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system">camera system</a>. It is the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20Nintendo%2064%20video%20games">Nintendo 64's bestseller</a>, with more than eleven million copies sold by 2003. The game left a lasting impression on the field of 3D game design, featuring a dynamic camera system and 360-degree analog control, and established a new archetype for the 3D genre, much as "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>" did for 2D <a href="Side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> platformers. Numerous developers cited "Super Mario 64" as an influence on their later games.

"Super Mario 64" is a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> <a href="platform%20game">platformer</a> in which the player controls <a href="Mario">Mario</a> through several courses. Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits. The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario, as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance, offer information, or ask a favor (such as peaceful pink Bob-omb Buddies). The player gathers stars in each course; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges include defeating a <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a>, solving puzzles, racing an opponent, and gathering coins. As more stars are collected, more areas of the castle hub world become accessible. The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses. There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets to the game, most containing extra stars required for the full completion of the game.

There are three special cap power-ups that appear in certain areas on many stages. The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage, allows him to withstand wind, walk underwater, and be unaffected by noxious gases; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh, as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage. Some courses contain <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s that Mario can access by speaking to a pink <a href="Bob-omb%20Buddy">Bob-omb Buddy</a>. After entering a cannon, Mario can be shot out to reach distant places. When the player has the Wing Cap equipped, cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.

Mario's abilities in "Super Mario 64" are far more diverse than those of previous "Mario" games. The player can make Mario walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, kick, or punch using the <a href="game%20controller">game controller</a>'s <a href="analog%20stick">analog stick</a> and buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps (jumping two and three times in a row, respectively), long jump and <a href="Somersault">backflip</a>. There are also special maneuvers, such as <a href="wall%20jump">wall jump</a>ing - jumping from one wall to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high. The player can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles, and swim underwater at various speeds. Mario's life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath.

"Super Mario 64" is set in <a href="Super%20Mario%23Settings">Princess Peach's Castle</a>, which consists of three floors, a basement, a moat, and a courtyard. The area outside the castle is an introductory area in which the player can experiment with gameplay. Scattered throughout the castle are entrances to courses via secret walls and paintings. "Super Mario 64" begins with a letter from <a href="Princess%20Peach">Princess Peach</a> inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. When he arrives, Mario discovers that <a href="Bowser%20%28character%29">Bowser</a> has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power Stars. Many of the castle's paintings are portals to other worlds, in which Bowser's minions keep watch over the stars. Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars. He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars, and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses, each leading to its own battle with Bowser. Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle, Peach is released from the <a href="Stained%20glass">stained-glass window</a> above the castle's entrance. Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.

More than five years prior to the release of "Super Mario 64", producer and director <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> conceived a 3D "Mario" design during the development of the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (SNES) game "<a href="Star%20Fox%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Star Fox</a>" (1993), developed by Nintendo along with <a href="Argonaut%20Software">Argonaut Software</a>. He considered using the <a href="Super%20FX">Super FX</a> chip to develop a SNES game which would have been called "Super Mario FX", with gameplay based on "an entire world in miniature, like miniature trains". Instead, he eventually reformulated the 3D "Mario" idea for the Nintendo 64 - not due to the next generation console's substantially greater power, but because its controller has more buttons for gameplay. According to former Argonaut engineer <a href="Q-Games">Dylan Cuthbert</a>, no game titled "Super Mario FX" had ever entered development, but rather "Super Mario FX" was the internal code name of the Super FX chip itself. According to Argonaut founder <a href="Jez%20San">Jez San</a>, "Super Mario 64" was influenced by a prototype of a canceled Argonaut game starring the "Mario" character <a href="Yoshi">Yoshi</a>, which later became the 1997 platform game "".

The full scope of "Super Mario 64" spanned approximately three years, with one year spent on the design concept and approximately two years on the direct development of the game software. Development began with the characters and <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system">camera system</a>. Miyamoto and the other designers were unsure of which direction the game should take; months were spent selecting a camera view and layout. The original concept involved the game having fixed path like an <a href="Isometric%20video%20game%20graphics">isometric-type game</a> (similar to "<a href="Super%20Mario%20RPG">Super Mario RPG</a>"), before the choice was made to settle on a free-roaming 3D design. Although the majority of "Super Mario 64" features the free-roaming design, elements of the original fixed path concept remain, particularly in the three Bowser encounters. One of the programmers, Giles Goddard, explained that these linear elements survived as a means to force players into Bowser's lair rather than encourage exploration.

3D graphics were created using the <a href="N-World">Nichimen N-World</a> toolkit running on a <a href="Silicon%20Graphics">Silicon Graphics</a> workstation. The team placed high priority on Mario's movement, and before levels were created, they tested and refined Mario's animations on a simple grid. The first test scenario for controls and physics involved Mario interacting with a golden rabbit, named "MIPS" after the Nintendo 64's <a href="MIPS%20architecture">MIPS architecture</a> processors; the rabbit was included in the final version of the game. The developers tried to implement <a href="Split%20screen%20%28computer%20graphics%29">split-screen</a> cooperative play using Mario and Luigi simultaneously where the two characters would start at separate points in the castle and work their way through the game together. The two-player mode was eliminated because the developers were unable to make the gameplay work satisfactorily. To assist players with <a href="depth%20perception">depth perception</a>, the team positioned a faux shadow directly beneath each object regardless of the area's lighting. Developer <a href="Yoshiaki%20Koizumi">Yoshiaki Koizumi</a> described the feature as an "iron-clad necessity" which "might not be realistic, but it's much easier to play."

Miyamoto's guiding design philosophy was to include more details than earlier games, using the Nintendo 64's power to feature "all the emotions of the characters". He likened the game's style to a 3D interactive cartoon. Some details were inspired by the developers' personal lives; for example, the <a href="Boo%20%28character%29">Boo</a>s are based on assistant director <a href="Takashi%20Tezuka">Takashi Tezuka</a>'s wife, who, as Miyamoto explained, "is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time Tezuka spent at work." In the game, the Boos shrink when Mario looks at them, but when he turns away, they grow large and menacing.

"Super Mario 64" features more puzzles than earlier "Mario" games. It was developed simultaneously with "", but as "Ocarina of Time" was released more than two years later, some puzzles were taken for "Super Mario 64". Information about "Super Mario 64" leaked in November 1995, and a playable version of the game was presented days later as part of the Nintendo 64 premiere (then known as the "Ultra 64") at <a href="Nintendo%20Space%20World">Nintendo Space World</a>. At this point, the basic controls had been implemented and the game was 50% finished, featuring 32 courses, though only about 2% of mapping was complete. Miyamoto had hoped to create more courses, but only 15 courses could fit. According to Nintendo of America chairman <a href="Howard%20Lincoln">Howard Lincoln</a>, Miyamoto's desire to add more to the game was a major factor in the decision to delay the Nintendo 64 release from Christmas 1995 to April 1996. Nintendo president <a href="Hiroshi%20Yamauchi">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a> later commented, "Game creators can finish games quickly if they compromise. But users have sharp eyes. They soon know if the games are compromised. [Shigeru Miyamoto] asked for two more months and I gave them to him unconditionally."

The music was composed by veteran composer <a href="Koji%20Kondo">Koji Kondo</a>, who created new interpretations of the familiar melodies from earlier games as well as entirely new material. "Super Mario 64" was one of the first games in the series to feature <a href="Charles%20Martinet">Charles Martinet</a> as the voice of <a href="Mario">Mario</a>. It also features the voices of Leslie Swan (then Senior Editor of "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>") as <a href="Princess%20Peach">Princess Peach</a>, who also wrote the English text for the game.

"Super Mario 64" received widespread critical acclaim and is the best-selling Nintendo 64 game. At the 1999 Milia festival in <a href="Cannes">Cannes</a>, it took home a "Gold" prize for revenues above €21 million in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> during the previous year. By May 2003, eleven million copies had been sold. "Super Mario 64" had become the second most popular game on <a href="Wii">Wii</a>'s <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> by June 2007, behind "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>"

The game has been praised in the gaming press, and is still highly acclaimed. It has collected numerous awards, including various "Game of the Year" honors by members of the gaming media, as well as Nintendo's own best-selling <a href="Nintendo%20Selects">Player's Choice</a> selection. In addition, "Super Mario 64" has been placed high on "the greatest games of all time" lists by many reviewers, including <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>", "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>", <a href="Yahoo%21%20Games">Yahoo! Games</a>, and "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>". "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" awarded the game a Gold award in its initial review, and in "Edge" magazine, "Super Mario 64" was the first game to receive a perfect score. At the 1997 <a href="Computer%20Game%20Developers%20Conference">Computer Game Developers Conference</a>, it was given <a href="Spotlight%20Awards">Spotlight Awards</a> for Best Use of Innovative Technology, Best Console Game, and Best Game of 1996. It won "Electronic Gaming Monthly"s Game of the Year for both editors' pick and readers' pick, as well as Nintendo 64 Game of the Year, Adventure Game of the Year, and Best Graphics. British magazine "Maximum" gave it their "Maximum Game of the Month Award", making it the only import game (since "Super Mario 64" had not yet been released outside Japan) to win that honor, and attested it to be the greatest game the magazine had ever reviewed. "Game Informer" initially rated the game a 9.75, but re-rated it a 9.0 a decade later in a "Retro Review". The Japanese gaming magazine "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" rated "Super Mario 64" a 39/40. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" gave it a perfect 5 out of 5 in every category (FunFactor, control, sound, and graphics). Common praise focused on the presentation, while criticism was directed at the <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system">camera system</a>. "Nintendo Power" lauded the graphics, sound, and gameplay, but commented the shifting camera angle took getting used to. "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation Magazine</a>" praised many aspects of the game: musical score, graphics, lack of loading times, and the scale of the game, though they commented that the game is less accessible than previous "Mario" games, citing the camera's occasional, erratic movements and lack of optimal angle as frustrating. "GamePro" particularly praised the combination of unprecedented technical performance and captivating artistic design, calling it "the most visually impressive game of all time." "Maximum" found the game's strongest points to be its sense of freedom and the fact that revisiting levels unearths new areas and challenges.

<a href="Video%20game%20journalism">Video game publications</a> and <a href="Video%20game%20developer">developers</a> praised "Super Mario 64" for its design and use of the 3D gameplay. The game is counted by <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> as one of the first games to have brought a series of 2D games into full 3D. "Maximum" commented that "The old 2D platform genre is essentially dead with the arrival of this game. The limitations inherent with the genre have been swept away in the wake of Mario 64." In the transition to 3D, many of the series conventions were rethought drastically, placing an emphasis on exploration over traditional platform jumping, or "hop and bop" action. While its quality was disputed by some, it has been argued that it established an entirely new genre, different from that of previous games in the series. "<a href="Time%20Magazine">Time Magazine</a>" focused on the realistic kinetic animation and the controls provided by the integration of the new pressure-sensitive controller into the game, calling it the "fastest, smoothest game action yet attainable via joystick at the service of equally virtuoso motion", where "[f]or once, the movement on the screen feels real".

In the same issue in which they reviewed the game, "Next Generation" ranked it number 1 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time". They explained, ""Super Mario 64" is the first true 3D game to play as good as the 2D games of the 16-bit era. ... As such, it represents the new high-water mark of both gameplay and graphic sophistication." <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> called it one of the 15 most influential games of all time, and rated the Nintendo 64 version a score of 9.4 and the Wii Virtual Console version an 8. "Game Informer" commented that even a decade later the game still offers hours of entertainment. They also commented on the camera system, stating that by present-day standards the camera system "would almost be considered broken". <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a>'s retrospective review referred to the graphics as "beautiful", but criticized the camera angles, saying "it doesn't work as well as it should". The game placed 6th in "<a href="Official%20Nintendo%20Magazine">Official Nintendo Magazine</a>"s "100 greatest Nintendo games of all time". In 2009, "Game Informer" put "Super Mario 64" 13th on their list of "The Top 200 Games of All Time". "Official Nintendo Magazine" referred to the game as a "masterpiece of game design", stating that Nintendo was able to take its "number-one 2D franchise and convert it flawlessly into 3D". Michael Grayford of <a href="Liquid%20Entertainment">Liquid Entertainment</a> stated he was initially "very turned off" by the openness of the game the first time he played it. Upon playing it later, he was "highly pleased" and stated "each level brought some new unique cool gameplay element and I was never bored". <a href="Warren%20Spector">Warren Spector</a>, former lead designer at <a href="Ion%20Storm">Ion Storm</a>, stated it was "not possible to squeeze this much gameplay into a single game" and "no game has done a better job of showing goals before they can be attained, allowing players to make a plan and execute on it". He also praised the exploration aspect of the game, commenting that "[allowing players to] explore the same spaces several times while revealing something new each time is a revelation".

Critics acknowledge "Super Mario 64" as a key contributor to the anticipation, and initial success, of the Nintendo 64 console. Though the system was initially very successful, it eventually lost much of its market share to Sony's <a href="PlayStation">PlayStation</a>. 1UP.com attributed this decline to Nintendo's use of cartridges and the design of the <a href="Nintendo%2064%20controller">Nintendo 64 controller</a>, which were reportedly implemented by Miyamoto for "Super Mario 64".

The game also set many precedents for 3D platformers to follow. GameDaily listed the game as one of the "Most Influential Video Games" and stated it "defined the 3-D platform experience, influencing numerous designers to create their own, original offerings". "<a href="GamesTM">GamesTM</a>" noted many game companies, including Nintendo, have tried to develop a platform game to match up to "Super Mario 64". Members of <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a>, a second-party developer for Nintendo during the 1990s, reflected in 2013 that during the development of 2001's "Conker's Bad Fur Day", they had originally drawn inspiration from their deep analysis of the gameplay and camera mechanics of "Super Mario 64": "We were just copying "Mario", weren't we? Which, to this day, is still the best 3D camera." "Super Mario 64" is notable for its sense of freedom and <a href="Nonlinear%20gameplay">non-linearity</a>. A central hub, where controls can be learned before entering levels themselves, has been used in many 3D platformers since. In addition, the game's mission-based level design is an inspiration for other game designers. <a href="Martin%20Hollis%20%28video%20game%20designer%29">Martin Hollis</a>, who produced and directed Rare's "<a href="GoldenEye%20007%20%281997%20video%20game%29">GoldenEye 007</a>", says "the idea for the huge variety of missions within a level came from "Super Mario 64"". In 2012, <a href="Dan%20Houser">Dan Houser</a>, a prominent figure in the development of the <a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto">"Grand Theft Auto" series</a>, stated, "Anyone who makes 3D games who says they've not borrowed something from "Mario" or "Zelda" [on the Nintendo 64] is lying." <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a>, a leading designer at <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a>, stated in 2016 that "Super Mario 64" was the impetus for the creation of the "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>" series.

"Super Mario 64" is the first game to have a "free" camera that can be controlled independently of the character. Most 3D games from the time use a <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person</a> perspective, or a camera that is fixed in position relative to the player's character, or to the level. To create freedom of exploration, and more fluid control in a 3D world, the designers created a dynamic system in which the <a href="professional%20video%20camera">video camera</a> is operated by the in-game character <a href="Lakitu">Lakitu</a>. The camera system would become the standard for 3D platform games in the future. "Nintendo Power" stated the camera-control scheme is what transitioned platform games into three dimensions, and that the game, along with "", "blazed trails" into the 3D era. Along with camera control, the game also innovated in its implementation of movement. "Edge" stated the game changed "gamers' expectations of 3D movement forever". The Nintendo 64's analog stick allows for more precise and wide-ranging character movements than the digital <a href="D-pad">D-pad</a>s of other consoles, and "Super Mario 64" uses this in a way that was unique for its time. At the time, 3D games generally allowed for controls in which the player could either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character's perspective. "Super Mario 64"s controls are fully analog, and interpret a 360-degree range of motion into navigation through a 3D space relative to the camera. The analog stick also allows for precise control over subtleties such as the speed at which Mario runs. "Super Mario 64" was one of the first games to implement the system.

Because of the game's popularity, rumors about glitches and secrets spread rapidly after its release. A common rumor was that <a href="Luigi">Luigi</a> was a secret character in the game, fueled by illegible symbols in the castle courtyard that were said to resemble the text "L is real 2401". This same texture would reappear in "" on a plaque in Dodongo's Cavern. IGN received so many questions and supposed methods to unlock Luigi that the staff offered a reward to anyone who could prove that Luigi was in the game. The number of false codes submitted to IGN dropped dramatically, as Luigi's inclusion was proved to be a myth. The <a href="April%20Fools%27%20Day">April Fools' Day</a> 1998 issue of "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" claims that the cryptic phrase would be discussed on the non-existent page 128, and also features a facetious article, "Luigi 64", commenting humorously on the rumor. Several players have discovered coins that were impossible to obtain without glitching the game. <a href="pannenkoek2012">Scott Buchanan</a>, under the alias pannenkoek2012, had managed to collect one of those coins in 2014 without tool-assistance, and also creates content about the programming mechanics of "Super Mario 64".

On May 5, 2011, "Super Mario 64" was selected as one of the 80 games to be displayed at the <a href="Smithsonian%20American%20Art%20Museum">Smithsonian American Art Museum</a> as part of "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20Video%20Games">The Art of Video Games</a>" exhibit that opened on March 16, 2012.

A <a href="64DD">64DD</a> version of the original game was created only for demonstration of the prototype drive's operation and performance at the 1996 <a href="Nintendo%20Space%20World">Nintendo Space World</a> trade show. Nintendo of America's Chairman Howard Lincoln explained, ""Super Mario 64" is running on the 64DD right now. First they weren't going to show anything on 64DD, but they decided at the last minute to have a game people recognize."

Like "<a href="Wave%20Race%2064">Wave Race 64</a>", "Super Mario 64" was re-released in Japan on July 18, 1997, as . This version adds support for Nintendo's <a href="Rumble%20Pak">Rumble Pak</a> peripheral and includes the voice acting from the English version. In 1998, "Super Mario 64" was re-released in Europe and North America as part of the <a href="Nintendo%20Selects">Player's Choice</a> line, a selection of games with high sales sold for a reduced price. The game was later released on the Wii's <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> service in the United States on November 19, 2006, and in other territories the following weeks. This release adds compatibility with the <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube%23Controller">GameCube</a> and <a href="Super%20Famicom%20Classic%20Controller">Classic</a> controllers, and enhances the resolution to 480p.

An <a href="video%20game%20remake">enhanced remake</a> for the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> called "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064%20DS">Super Mario 64 DS</a>" was available for the launch of the handheld system in 2004. <a href="Yoshi">Yoshi</a>, <a href="Luigi">Luigi</a>, and <a href="Wario">Wario</a> are additional playable characters, and the game features improved graphics, slightly altered courses, <a href="touchscreen">touchscreen</a> mini-games, and a <a href="multiplayer">multiplayer</a> mode. In addition, the number of Power Stars has been raised from 120 to 150. Reviews were mostly positive, and by March 2008, 6.12 million copies of "Super Mario 64 DS" had been sold worldwide. In 2015, a <a href="Fangame">fan remake</a> of "Super Mario 64" was created in <a href="Unity%20%28game%20engine%29">Unity</a>, called "Super Mario 64 HD". The project was later taken down due to a <a href="Copyright%20infringement">copyright claim</a> by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>.

A direct sequel tentatively titled "Super Mario 64 2" was planned for the <a href="Nintendo%2064DD">Nintendo 64DD</a>. In July 1996 Nintendo insiders stated that Miyamoto was assembling a team to work on a "Super Mario 64" sequel, consisting mostly of developers who had worked on the original "Super Mario 64". Miyamoto mentioned at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a>'s 1997 convention that he was "just getting started" on the project. In May 1999, "Super Mario 64 2" was reported to be released in late 1999; however, the game was canceled due to the commercial failure of the 64DD, as well as lack of progress in the game's development.

Instead, "Super Mario 64" was followed by other 3D "Mario" games on subsequent Nintendo systems, such as "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>" for the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> and "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>" for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>. These games built on "Super Mario 64"s core design of enhancement items and open ended gameplay. "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Galaxy%202">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>" features a remake of "Mario 64"s Whomp's Fortress level. Later 3D games, namely "<a href="Super%20Mario%203D%20Land">Super Mario 3D Land</a>" and "<a href="Super%20Mario%203D%20World">Super Mario 3D World</a>", while keeping many of "Super Mario 64"s core gameplay elements, departed from the game's open-ended design and focused more on platforming reminiscent of 2D games. The <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> game "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>" returns to "Super Mario 64"s open design.

Millipede

Millipedes are a group of <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s that are characterised by having two pairs of jointed <a href="arthropod%20leg">legs</a> on most body segments; they are known scientifically as the <a href="class%20%28biology%29">class</a> Diplopoda, the name being derived from this feature. Each double-legged segment is a result of two single segments fused together. Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies with more than 20 segments, while <a href="pill%20millipede">pill millipede</a>s are shorter and can roll into a ball. Although the name "millipede" derives from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "thousand feet", no known species has 1,000; the record of 750 legs belongs to "<a href="Illacme">Illacme plenipes</a>". There are approximately 12,000 named <a href="species">species</a> classified into 16 <a href="order%20%28biology%29">orders</a> and around 140 <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a>, making Diplopoda the largest class of <a href="myriapod">myriapod</a>s, an arthropod group which also includes <a href="centipede">centipede</a>s and other multi-legged creatures.

Most millipedes are slow-moving <a href="detritivore">detritivore</a>s, eating decaying leaves and other dead plant matter. Some eat <a href="fungus">fungi</a> or suck plant fluids, and a small minority are <a href="predation">predatory</a>. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, and can even become household or garden <a href="pest%20%28organism%29">pests</a>. Millipedes can also be unwanted especially in <a href="greenhouse">greenhouse</a>s where they can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves with a variety of chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny <a href="bristle%20millipede">bristle millipede</a>s are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. <a href="Arthropod%23Reproduction%20and%20development">Reproduction</a> in most species is carried out by modified male legs called <a href="gonopod%20%28millipede%29">gonopods</a>, which transfer packets of sperm to females.

First appearing in the <a href="Silurian">Silurian</a> period, millipedes are some of the oldest known <a href="Colonization%20of%20the%20land">land animals</a>. Some members of prehistoric groups grew to over ; the largest modern species reach maximum lengths of . The longest extant species is the giant African millipede ("<a href="Archispirostreptus%20gigas">Archispirostreptus gigas</a>").

Among myriapods, millipedes have traditionally been considered most closely related to the tiny <a href="pauropod">pauropod</a>s, although some <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular studies</a> challenge this relationship. Millipedes can <a href="Millipede%23Distinction%20from%20centipedes">be distinguished</a> from the somewhat similar but only distantly related <a href="centipede">centipede</a>s (class Chilopoda), which move rapidly, are <a href="carnivorous">carnivorous</a>, and have only a single pair of legs on each body segment. The scientific study of millipedes is known as diplopodology, and a scientist who studies them is called a diplopodologist.

The scientific name "Diplopoda" comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words <a href="wikt%3Adiplo-">διπλοῦς</a> (<a href="wikt%3Adiplo-">"diplous"</a>), "double" and <a href="wikt%3A-pod">ποδός</a> (<a href="wikt%3A-pod">"podos"</a>), "foot", referring to the appearance of two pairs of legs on most segments, as described below. The common name "millipede" is a compound word formed from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> roots ' ("thousand") and ' ("foot"). The term "millipede" is widespread in popular and scientific literature, but among North American scientists, the term "milliped" (without the terminal e) is also used. Other vernacular names include "thousand-legger" or simply "diplopod". The science of millipede biology and taxonomy is called diplopodology: the study of diplopods.

Approximately 12,000 millipede <a href="species">species</a> have been described. Estimates of the true number of species on earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have very poor dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid <a href="speciation">speciation</a>, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.

The living members of the Diplopoda are divided into sixteen orders in two subclasses. The basal subclass Penicillata contains a single order, Polyxenida (bristle millipedes). All other millipedes belong to the subclass Chilognatha consisting of two infraclasses: Pentazonia, containing the short-bodied pill millipedes, and Helminthomorpha (worm-like millipedes), containing the great majority of the species.

The higher-level classification of millipedes is presented below, based on Shear, 2011, and Shear & Edgecombe, 2010 (extinct groups). Recent cladistic and molecular studies have challenged the traditional classification schemes above, and in particular the position of the orders Siphoniulida and Polyzoniida is not yet well established. The placement and positions of extinct groups (†) known only from fossils is tentative and not fully resolved. After each name is listed the <a href="author%20citation%20%28zoology%29">author citation</a>: the name of the person who coined the name or defined the group, even if not at the current rank.

Class Diplopoda 

Millipedes are among the first animals to have <a href="Colonization%20of%20the%20land">colonised land</a> during the <a href="Silurian">Silurian period</a>. Early forms probably ate <a href="moss">moss</a>es and primitive <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a>s. There are two major groups of millipedes whose members are all extinct: the <a href="Archipolypoda">Archipolypoda</a> ("ancient, many-legged ones") which contain the oldest known terrestrial animals, and <a href="Arthropleuridea">Arthropleuridea</a>, which contain the largest known land invertebrates. The earliest known land creature, "<a href="Pneumodesmus%20newmani">Pneumodesmus newmani</a>", was a long archipolypodan that lived 428 million years ago in the upper Silurian, and has clear evidence of <a href="spiracle">spiracle</a>s (breathing holes) attesting to its air-breathing habits. During the Upper <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> (), "<a href="Arthropleura">Arthropleura</a>" became the largest known land-dwelling invertebrate on record, reaching lengths of at least . Millipedes also exhibit the earliest evidence of chemical defence, as some <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> fossils have defensive gland openings called <a href="ozopore">ozopore</a>s. Millipedes, centipedes, and other terrestrial arthropods attained very large sizes in comparison to modern species in the oxygen-rich environments of the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, and some could grow larger than one metre. As oxygen levels lowered through time, arthropods became smaller.

The history of scientific millipede classification began with <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, who in his <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition of "Systema Naturae"</a>, 1758, named seven species of "<a href="Julus%20%28genus%29">Julus</a>" as "Insecta Aptera" (wingless insects). In 1802, the French zoologist <a href="Pierre%20Andr%C3%A9%20Latreille">Pierre André Latreille</a> proposed the name Chilognatha as the first group of what are now the Diplopoda, and in 1840 the German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20von%20Brandt">Johann Friedrich von Brandt</a> produced the first detailed classification. The name Diplopoda itself was coined in 1844 by the French zoologist <a href="Henri%20Marie%20Ducrotay%20de%20Blainville">Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville</a>. From 1890 to 1940, millipede taxonomy was driven by relatively few researchers at any given time, with major contributions by <a href="Carl%20Attems">Carl Attems</a>, <a href="Karl%20Wilhelm%20Verhoeff">Karl Wilhelm Verhoeff</a> and <a href="Ralph%20Vary%20Chamberlin">Ralph Vary Chamberlin</a>, who each described over 1,000 species, as well as <a href="Orator%20F.%20Cook">Orator F. Cook</a>, <a href="Filippo%20Silvestri">Filippo Silvestri</a>, <a href="R.%20I.%20Pocock">R. I. Pocock</a>, and <a href="Henry%20Wilfred%20Brolemann">Henry W. Brölemann</a>. This was a period when the science of diplopodology flourished: rates of species descriptions were on average the highest in history, sometimes exceeding 300 per year.

In 1971, the Dutch biologist <a href="C.%20A.%20W.%20Jeekel">C. A. W. Jeekel</a> published a comprehensive listing of all known millipede genera and families described between 1758 and 1957 in his "Nomenclator Generum et Familiarum Diplopodorum", a work credited as launching the "modern era" of millipede taxonomy. In 1980, the American biologist <a href="Richard%20L.%20Hoffman">Richard L. Hoffman</a> published a classification of millipedes which recognized the Penicillata, Pentazonia, and Helminthomorpha, and the first phylogenetic analysis of millipede orders using modern <a href="cladistics">cladistic methods</a> was published in 1984 by Henrik Enghoff of Denmark. A 2003 classification by the American myriapodologist Rowland Shelley is similar to the one originally proposed by Verhoeff, and remains the currently accepted classification scheme (shown below), despite more recent molecular studies proposing conflicting relationships. A 2011 summary of millipede family diversity by William A. Shear placed the order <a href="Siphoniulida">Siphoniulida</a> within the larger group Nematophora.

In addition to the 16 living orders, there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils. The relationship of these to living groups and to each other is controversial. The extinct Arthropleuridea was long considered a distinct myriapod class, although work in the early 21st century established the group as a subclass of millipedes. Several living orders also appear in the fossil record. Below are two proposed arrangements of fossil millipede groups. Extinct groups are indicated with a <a href="dagger%20%28typography%29">dagger</a> (†). The extinct order <a href="Zosterogrammida">Zosterogrammida</a>, a chilognath of uncertain position, is not shown.

Although the relationships of millipede orders are still the subject of debate, the class Diplopoda as a whole is considered a <a href="monophyletic%20group">monophyletic group</a> of arthropods: all millipedes are more closely related to each other than to any other arthropods. Diplopoda is a class within of the arthropod subphylum <a href="Myriapoda">Myriapoda</a>, the myriapods, which includes <a href="centipede">centipede</a>s (class Chilopoda) as well as the lesser-known <a href="Pauropoda">pauropods</a> (class Pauropoda) and <a href="symphyla">symphyla</a>ns (class Symphyla). Within myriapods, the closest relatives or <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> of millipedes has long been considered the pauropods, which also have a collum and diplosegments.

The differences between millipedes and centipedes are a common question from the general public. Both groups of myriapods share similarities, such as long, multi-segmented bodies, many legs, a single pair of antennae, and the presence of <a href="T%C3%B6m%C3%B6sv%C3%A1ry%20organ">postanntennal organ</a>s, but have many differences and distinct evolutionary histories, as the <a href="most%20recent%20common%20ancestor">most recent common ancestor</a> of centipedes and millipedes lived around 450 to 475 million years ago in the Silurian. The head alone exemplifies the differences; millipedes have short, elbowed antennae for probing the substrate, a pair of robust mandibles and a single pair of maxillae fused into a lip; centipedes have long, threadlike antennae, a pair of small mandibles, two pairs of maxillae and a pair of large poison claws.

Millipedes come in a variety of body shapes and sizes, ranging from to around in length, and can have as few as eleven to over a hundred segments. They are generally black or brown in colour, although there are a few brightly coloured species, and some have <a href="Aposematism">aposematic</a> colouring to warn that they are toxic. Species of "<a href="Motyxia">Motyxia</a>" produce <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a> as a chemical defence and are <a href="Bioluminescence">bioluminescent</a>.

Body styles vary greatly between major millipede groups. In the <a href="basal%20%28evolution%29">basal</a> subclass <a href="Penicillata">Penicillata</a>, consisting of the tiny <a href="bristle%20millipede">bristle millipede</a>s, the exoskeleton is soft and uncalcified, and is covered in prominent <a href="seta">seta</a>e or bristles. All other millipedes, belonging to the subclass Chilognatha, have a hardened exoskeleton. The chilognaths are in turn divided into two infraclasses: the <a href="Pentazonia">Pentazonia</a>, containing relatively short-bodied groups such as <a href="pill%20millipede">pill millipede</a>s, and the Helminthomorpha ("worm-like" millipedes), which contains the vast majority of species, with long, many-segmented bodies.

The head of a millipede is typically rounded above and flattened below and bears a pair of large <a href="mandible%20%28arthropod%29">mandibles</a> in front of a plate-like structure called a <a href="gnathochilarium">gnathochilarium</a> ("jaw lip"). The head contains a single pair of <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a> with seven or eight segments and a group of sensory cones at the tip. Many orders also possess a pair of sensory organs known as the Tömösváry organs, shaped as small oval rings posterior and lateral to the base of the antennae. Their function is unknown, but they also occur in some <a href="centipede">centipede</a>s, and are possibly used to measure humidity or light levels in the surrounding environment.

Millipede eyes consist of several simple flat-lensed <a href="Simple%20eye%20in%20invertebrates%23Simple%20eyes%20in%20arthropods">ocelli</a> arranged in a group or patch on each side of the head. These patches are also called ocular fields or ocellaria. Many species of millipedes, including the entire order <a href="Polydesmida">Polydesmida</a> and cave-dwelling millipedes such as "<a href="Causeyella">Causeyella</a>" and "<a href="Trichopetalum%20whitei">Trichopetalum</a>", had ancestors that could see but have subsequently lost their eyes and are blind.

Millipede bodies may be flattened or cylindrical, and are composed of numerous <a href="Metamerism%20%28biology%29">metemeric segments</a>, each with an <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a> consisting of five <a href="chitin">chitin</a>ous plates: a single plate above (the <a href="tergite">tergite</a>), one at each side (<a href="pleurite">pleurite</a>s), and a plate on the underside (<a href="sternite">sternite</a>) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. Because they lack a waxy cuticle and can't close their permanently open spiracles, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must spend most of their time in moist or humid environments.

The first segment behind the head is legless and known as a collum (from the Latin for neck or collar). The second, third, and fourth body segments bear a single pair of legs each and are known as "haplosegments", from the Greek "haplo", "single" (the three haplosegments are sometimes referred to as a "<a href="Thorax%23In%20arthropods">thorax</a>"). The remaining segments, from the fifth to the posterior, are properly known as diplosegments or double segments, formed by the fusion of two embryonic segments. Each diplosegment bears two pairs of legs, rather than just one as in centipedes. In some millipedes, the last few segments may be legless. The terms "segment" or "body ring" are often used interchangeably to refer to both haplo- and diplosegments. The final segment is known as the <a href="telson">telson</a> and consists of a legless preanal ring, a pair of anal valves (closeable plates around the anus), and a small scale below the anus.

Millipedes in several orders have keel-like extensions of the body-wall known as <a href="paranota">paranota</a>, which can vary widely in shape, size, and texture; modifications include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches. Paranota may allow millipedes to wedge more securely into crevices, protect the legs, or make the millipede more difficult for predators to swallow.

The legs are composed of seven segments, and attach on the underside of the body. The legs of an individual are generally rather similar to each other, although often longer in males than females, and males of some species may have a reduced or enlarged first pair of legs. The most conspicuous leg modifications are involved in reproduction, discussed below. Despite the common name, no millipede has been discovered with 1,000 legs: common species have between 34 and 400 legs, and the record is held by "<a href="Illacme%20plenipes">Illacme plenipes</a>", with individuals possessing up to 750 legs – more than any other creature on Earth.

Millipedes breathe through two pairs of spiracles located ventrally on each segment near the base of the legs. Each opens into an internal pouch, and connects to a system of <a href="Invertebrate%20trachea">tracheae</a>. The heart runs the entire length of the body, with an <a href="aorta">aorta</a> stretching into the head. The excretory organs are two pairs of <a href="malpighian%20tubule">malpighian tubule</a>s, located near the mid-part of the gut. The digestive tract is a simple tube with two pairs of <a href="salivary%20gland">salivary gland</a>s to help digest the food.

Millipedes show a diversity of mating styles and structures. In the basal order <a href="Polyxenida">Polyxenida</a> (bristle millipedes), mating is indirect: males deposit <a href="spermatophore">spermatophore</a>s onto webs they secrete with special glands, and the spermatophores are subsequently picked up by females. In all other millipede groups, males possess one or two pairs of modified legs called <a href="gonopod">gonopod</a>s which are used to transfer sperm to the female during copulation. The location of the gonopods differs between groups: in males of the Pentazonia they are located at the rear of the body and known as telopods and may also function in grasping females, while in the Helminthomorpha – the vast majority of species – they are located on the seventh body segment. A few species are <a href="parthenogenesis">parthenogenetic</a>, having few, if any, males.
Gonopods occur in a diversity of shapes and sizes, and in the range from closely resembling walking legs to complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between closely related species but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.

The genital openings (<a href="gonopore">gonopore</a>s) of both sexes are located on the underside of the third body segment (near the second pair of legs) and may be accompanied in the male by one or two <a href="Penis%23Invertebrates">penes</a> which deposit the sperm packets onto the gonopods. In the female, the genital pores open into paired small sacs called <a href="cyphopod">cyphopod</a>s or vulvae, which are covered by small hood-like lids, and are used to store the sperm after copulation. The cyphopod morphology can also be used to identify species. Millipede <a href="sperm">sperm</a> lack <a href="flagellum">flagella</a>, a unique trait among myriapods.

In all except the bristle millipedes, copulation occurs with the two individuals facing one another. Copulation may be preceded by male behaviours such as tapping with antennae, running along the back of the female, offering edible glandular secretions, or in the case of some pill-millipedes, <a href="stridulation">stridulation</a> or "chirping". During copulation in most millipedes, the male positions his seventh segment in front of the female's third segment, and may insert his gonopods to extrude the vulvae before bending his body to deposit sperm onto his gonopods and reinserting the "charged" gonopods into the female.

Females lay from ten to three hundred eggs at a time, depending on species, fertilising them with the stored sperm as they do so. Many species deposit the eggs on moist soil or organic detritus, but some construct nests lined with dried <a href="faeces">faeces</a>, and may protect the eggs within silk cocoons. In most species, the female abandons the eggs after they are laid, but some species in the orders <a href="Platydesmida">Platydesmida</a> and <a href="Stemmiulida">Stemmiulida</a> provide <a href="Parental%20investment">parental care</a> for eggs and young.

The young hatch after a few weeks, and typically have only three pairs of legs, followed by up to four legless segments. As they grow, they continually <a href="ecdysis">moult</a>, adding further segments and legs as they do so. Some species moult within specially prepared chambers of soil or silk, and may also shelter in these during wet weather, and most species eat the discarded exoskeleton after moulting. The adult stage, when individuals become reproductively mature, is generally reached in the final moult stage, which varies between species and orders, although some species continue to moult after adulthood. Furthermore, some species alternate between reproductive and non-reproductive stages after maturity, a phenomenon known as periodomorphosis, in which the reproductive structures regress during non-reproductive stages. Millipedes may live from one to ten years, depending on species.

Millipedes occur on all continents except Antarctica, and occupy almost all terrestrial habitats, ranging as far north as the <a href="Arctic%20Circle">Arctic Circle</a> in Iceland, Norway, and Central Russia, and as far south as <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Province%2C%20Argentina">Santa Cruz Province, Argentina</a>. Typically forest floor dwellers, they live in leaf litter, dead wood, or soil, with a preference for humid conditions. In <a href="temperate%20zones">temperate zones</a>, millipedes are most abundant in moist deciduous forests, and may reach densities of over 1,000 individuals per square metre. Other habitats include coniferous forests, deserts, caves, and alpine ecosystems. Some species can survive freshwater floods and live submerged underwater for up to 11 months. A few species occur near the seashore and can survive in somewhat salty conditions.

The diplosegments of millipedes have evolved in conjunction with their burrowing habits, and nearly all millipedes adopt a mainly subterranean lifestyle. They use three main methods of burrowing; bulldozing, wedging and boring. Members of the orders <a href="Julida">Julida</a>, <a href="Spirobolida">Spirobolida</a> and <a href="Spirostreptida">Spirostreptida</a>, lower their heads and barge their way into the substrate, the collum being the portion of their exoskeleton that leads the way. Flat-backed millipedes in the order Polydesmida tend to insert their front end, like a wedge, into a horizontal crevice, and then widen the crack by pushing upwards with their legs, the paranota in this instance constituting the main lifting surface. Boring is used by members of the order <a href="Polyzoniida">Polyzoniida</a>. These have smaller segments at the front and increasingly large ones further back; they propel themselves forward into a crack with their legs, the wedge-shaped body widening the gap as they go. Some millipedes have adopted an above-ground lifestyle and lost the burrowing habit. This may be because they are too small to have enough leverage to burrow, or because they are too large to make the effort worthwhile, or in some cases because they move relatively fast (for a millipede) and are active predators.

Most millipedes are <a href="detritivore">detritivore</a>s and feed on decomposing vegetation, feces, or organic matter mixed with soil. They often play important roles in the breakdown and <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a> of <a href="plant%20litter">plant litter</a>: estimates of consumption rates for individual species range from 1 to 11 percent of all leaf litter, depending on species and region, and collectively millipedes may consume nearly all the leaf litter in a region. The leaf litter is fragmented in the millipede gut and excreted as pellets of leaf fragments, algae, fungi, and bacteria, which facilitates decomposition by the microorganisms. Where <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a> populations are low in tropical forests, millipedes play an important role in facilitating microbial decomposition of the leaf litter. Some millipedes are herbivorous, feeding on living plants, and some species can become serious pests of crops. Millipedes in the order Polyxenida graze algae from bark, and Platydesmida feed on fungi. A few species are <a href="Omnivore">omnivorous</a> or occasionally carnivorous, feeding on insects, centipedes, earthworms, or <a href="Pulmonata">snails</a>. Some species have piercing mouth parts that allow them to suck up plant juices.

Millipedes are <a href="predation">preyed on</a> by a wide range of animals, including various <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s, <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s, <a href="bird">bird</a>s, <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, and <a href="insect">insect</a>s. Mammalian predators such as <a href="coati">coati</a>s and <a href="meerkat">meerkat</a>s roll captured millipedes on the ground to deplete and rub off their defensive secretions before consuming their prey, and certain <a href="poison%20dart%20frog">poison dart frog</a>s are believed to incorporate the toxic compounds of millipedes into their own defences. Several invertebrates have specialised behaviours or structures to feed on millipedes, including larval <a href="Phengodidae">glowworm beetles</a>, "<a href="Probolomyrmex">Probolomyrmex</a>" ants, <a href="Chlamydephorus">chlamydephorid slugs</a>, and predaceous dung beetles of the genera "<a href="Sceliages">Sceliages</a>" and "<a href="Deltochilum%20valgum">Deltochilum</a>". A large subfamily of <a href="Reduviidae">assassin bugs</a>, the <a href="Ectrichodiinae">Ectrichodiinae</a> with over 600 species, has specialized in preying upon millipedes. <a href="Parasitism">Parasites</a> of millipedes include <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s, <a href="Sciomyzidae">phaeomyiid flies</a>, and <a href="acanthocephala">acanthocephala</a>ns. Nearly 30 fungal species of the order <a href="Laboulbeniales">Laboulbeniales</a> have been found growing externally on millipedes, but some species may be <a href="commensalism">commensal</a> rather than parasitic.

Due to their lack of speed and their inability to bite or sting, millipedes' primary <a href="Anti-predator%20adaptation">defence mechanism</a> is to curl into a tight coil – protecting their delicate legs inside an armoured exoskeleton.

Many species also emit various foul-smelling liquid secretions through microscopic holes called ozopores (the openings of "odoriferous" or "repugnatorial glands"), along the sides of their bodies as a secondary defence. Among the many irritant and toxic chemicals found in these secretions are <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a>s, <a href="benzoquinone">benzoquinone</a>s, <a href="phenols">phenols</a>, <a href="terpenoid">terpenoid</a>s, and <a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a>. Some of these substances are <a href="Corrosive%20substance">caustic</a> and can burn the exoskeleton of <a href="ant">ant</a>s and other insect predators, and the skin and eyes of larger predators. Primates such as <a href="capuchin%20monkey">capuchin monkey</a>s and <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s have been observed intentionally irritating millipedes in order to rub the chemicals on themselves to repel <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es. Some of these defensive compounds also show antifungal activity.

The bristly millipedes (order Polyxenida) lack both an armoured exoskeleton and odiferous glands, and instead are covered in numerous bristles that in at least one species, "<a href="Polyxenus%20fasciculatus">Polyxenus fasciculatus</a>", detach and entangle ants.

Some millipedes form <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic relationships</a> with organisms of other species, in which both species benefit from the interaction, or <a href="Commensalism">commensal relationships</a>, in which only one species benefits while the other is unaffected. Several species form close relationships with ants, a relationship known as <a href="myrmecophily">myrmecophily</a>, especially within the family <a href="Pyrgodesmidae">Pyrgodesmidae</a> (Polydesmida), which contains "obligate myrmecophiles", species which have only been found in ant colonies. More species are "facultative myrmecophiles", being non-exclusively associated with ants, including many species of Polyxenida that have been found in ant nests around the world.

Many millipede species have commensal relationships with <a href="mite">mite</a>s of the orders <a href="Mesostigmata">Mesostigmata</a> and <a href="Astigmata">Astigmata</a>. Many of these mites are believed to be <a href="Phoresy">phoretic</a> rather than parasitic, which means that they use the millipede host as a means of dispersal.

A novel interaction between millipedes and mosses was described in 2011, in which individuals of the newly discovered "<a href="Psammodesmus%20bryophorus">Psammodesmus bryophorus</a>" was found to have up to ten species living on its dorsal surface, in what may provide <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a> for the millipede and increased dispersal for the mosses.

Millipedes generally have little impact on human economic or social well-being, especially in comparison with insects, although locally they can be a nuisance or agricultural <a href="pest%20%28organism%29">pest</a>. Millipedes do not bite, and their defensive secretions are mostly harmless to humans — usually causing only minor discolouration on the skin — but the secretions of some tropical species may cause pain, itching, local <a href="erythema">erythema</a>, <a href="edema">edema</a>, <a href="blister">blister</a>s, <a href="Dermatitis">eczema</a>, and occasionally cracked skin. Eye exposures to these secretions causes general irritation and potentially more severe effects such as <a href="conjunctivitis">conjunctivitis</a> and <a href="keratitis">keratitis</a>. This is called <a href="millipede%20burn">millipede burn</a>. <a href="First%20aid">First aid</a> consists of flushing the area thoroughly with water; further treatment is aimed at relieving the local effects.
Some millipedes are considered household pests, including "<a href="Xenobolus%20carnifex">Xenobolus carnifex</a>" which can infest thatched roofs in India, and "<a href="Ommatoiulus%20moreleti">Ommatoiulus moreleti</a>", which periodically invades homes in Australia. Other species exhibit periodical <a href="Swarm%20behaviour">swarming behaviour</a>, which can result in home invasions, crop damage, and train delays when the tracks become slippery with the crushed remains of hundreds of millipedes. Some millipedes can cause significant damage to crops: the <a href="spotted%20snake%20millipede">spotted snake millipede</a> ("Blaniulus guttulatus") is a noted pest of <a href="sugar%20beet">sugar beet</a>s and other root crops, and as a result is one of the few millipedes with a <a href="common%20name">common name</a>.

Some of the larger millipedes in the orders Spirobolida, Spirostreptida, and <a href="Sphaerotheriida">Sphaerotheriida</a> are popular as pets. Some species commonly sold or kept include species of "<a href="Archispirostreptus">Archispirostreptus</a>", "<a href="Aphistogoniulus">Aphistogoniulus</a>", "<a href="Narceus">Narceus</a>", and "<a href="Orthoporus">Orthoporus</a>".

Millipedes appear in <a href="folklore">folklore</a> and <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a> around the world. Some cultures associate millipede activity with coming rains. In the <a href="Yoruba%20people">Yoruba culture</a> of <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, millipedes are used in pregnancy and business rituals, and crushed millipedes are used to treat fever, <a href="whitlow">whitlow</a>, and <a href="convulsion">convulsion</a> in children. In Zambia, smashed millipede pulp is used to treat wounds, and the <a href="Bafia%20people">Bafia people</a> of Cameroon use millipede juice to treat earache. In certain Himalayan <a href="Bhotiya">Bhotiya</a> tribes, dry millipede smoke is used to treat <a href="haemorrhoid">haemorrhoid</a>s. Native people in <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> use millipede secretions in poison-tipped arrows. The secretions of "Spirobolus bungii" have been observed to inhibit division of human cancer cells. The only recorded usage of millipedes as food by humans comes from the <a href="Bobo%20people">Bobo people</a> of <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a>, who consume boiled, dried millipedes in tomato sauce.

Millipedes have also inspired and played roles in scientific research. In 1963, a walking vehicle with 36 legs was designed, said to have been inspired by a study of millipede locomotion.
Experimental robots have had the same inspiration, in particular when heavy loads are needed to be carried in tight areas involving turns and curves. In biology, some authors have advocated millipedes as <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>s for the study of arthropod physiology and the developmental processes controlling the number and shape of body segments.

Profumo affair

The Profumo affair was a British <a href="political%20scandal">political scandal</a> that originated with a brief sexual relationship in 1961 between <a href="John%20Profumo">John Profumo</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Secretary of State for War</a> in <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>'s Conservative government, and <a href="Christine%20Keeler">Christine Keeler</a>, a 19-year-old would-be model. In March 1963, Profumo's denial of any impropriety, in a personal statement to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, was refuted a few weeks later with his admission of the truth. He resigned from the government and from <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a>. The repercussions of the affair severely damaged Macmillan's self-confidence, and he resigned as <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> on health grounds in October 1963. The reputation of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> was damaged by the scandal, which may have contributed to its defeat by the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201964">1964 general election</a>.

When the Profumo–Keeler affair was first revealed, public interest was heightened by reports that Keeler may have been simultaneously involved with Captain <a href="Yevgeny%20Ivanov%20%28spy%29">Yevgeny Ivanov</a>, a <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> <a href="Military%20attach%C3%A9">naval attaché</a>, thereby creating a possible security risk. Keeler knew both Profumo and Ivanov through her friendship with <a href="Stephen%20Ward">Stephen Ward</a>, an <a href="Doctor%20of%20Osteopathic%20Medicine">osteopath</a> and socialite who had taken her under his wing. The exposure of the affair generated rumours of other scandals, and drew official attention to the activities of Ward, who was charged with a series of immorality offences. Perceiving himself as a <a href="scapegoat">scapegoat</a> for the misdeeds of others, Ward took a <a href="suicide">fatal overdose</a> during the final stages of his trial, which found him guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Keeler and her friend <a href="Mandy%20Rice-Davies">Mandy Rice-Davies</a>.

An inquiry into the affair by a senior judge, <a href="Alfred%20Denning%2C%20Baron%20Denning">Lord Denning</a>, indicated that there had been no breaches of security arising from the Ivanov connection, although Denning's report was later condemned as superficial and unsatisfactory. Profumo subsequently sought private atonement as a volunteer worker at <a href="Toynbee%20Hall">Toynbee Hall</a>, an East London charitable trust. Keeler found it difficult to escape the negative image attached to her by press, law and parliament throughout the Profumo affair. In various, sometimes contradictory accounts, she challenged Denning's conclusions relating to security issues. Ward's conviction has been described by analysts as an act of <a href="The%20Establishment">Establishment</a> revenge, rather than serving justice. In January 2014 his case was under review by the <a href="Criminal%20Cases%20Review%20Commission">Criminal Cases Review Commission</a>, with the possibility of a later reference to the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Court of Appeal</a>. Dramatisations of the Profumo affair have been shown on stage and screen. Profumo died in 2006, while Keeler died in 2017.

In the early 1960s British news media were dominated by several high-profile spying stories: the breaking of the <a href="Portland%20spy%20ring">Portland spy ring</a> in 1961, the capture and sentencing of <a href="George%20Blake">George Blake</a> in the same year and, in 1962, the case of the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> clerk, <a href="John%20Vassall">John Vassall</a>, blackmailed into spying by the <a href="Soviets">Soviets</a> who threatened to expose his homosexuality. In October 1962 Vassall was jailed for 18 years. After suggestions in the press that Vassall had been shielded by his political masters, the responsible minister, <a href="Tam%20Galbraith">Thomas Galbraith</a>, resigned from the government pending inquiries. Galbraith was later exonerated by the <a href="Cyril%20Radcliffe%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Radcliffe">Radcliffe inquiry</a>, which sent two newspaper journalists to prison for refusing to reveal their sources for sensational and uncorroborated stories about Vassall's private life. The imprisonment severely damaged relations between the press and the <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Macmillan</a> government; the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>"s columnist <a href="Paul%20Johnson%20%28writer%29">Paul Johnson</a> warned: "[A]ny Tory minister or MP ... who gets involved in a scandal during the next year or so must expect—I regret to say—the full treatment".

<a href="Brigadier%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Brigadier</a> <a href="John%20Profumo">John, 5th Baron Profumo</a> (1915–2006), was born in 1915, of <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> descent. His family, on his father's side, were minor Italian aristocracy, and were awarded a low-ranking <a href="Nobility%20of%20Italy">Italian peerage</a> by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sardinia">Kingdom of Sardinia</a> in 1843. 'Jack' Profumo inherited this peerage, the title of <a href="Baron%20Profumo">Baron Profumo</a>, upon <a href="Albert%20Profumo">his father</a>'s death on 27 March 1940. He first entered <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> in 1940 as the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> member for <a href="Kettering%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Kettering</a>, while serving with the <a href="Northamptonshire%20Yeomanry">Northamptonshire Yeomanry</a>, and combined his political and military duties through the Second World War. He lost his seat in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 general election</a>, but was elected in 1950 for <a href="Stratford-on-Avon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Stratford-on-Avon</a>. From 1951 he held junior ministerial office in successive Conservative administrations. In 1960, Macmillan promoted him to <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Secretary of State for War</a>, a senior post outside the <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a>. After his marriage in 1954 to <a href="Valerie%20Hobson">Valerie Hobson</a>, one of Britain's leading film actresses, he may have conducted casual affairs, using late-night parliamentary sittings as his cover. <a href="Baron%23Italy">Baron</a> Profumo's tenure as war minister coincided with a period of transition in the armed forces, involving the end of conscription and the development of a wholly professional army. His performance was watched with a critical eye by his opposition counterpart <a href="George%20Wigg%2C%20Baron%20Wigg">George Wigg</a>, a former <a href="Regular%20army">regular soldier</a>.

<a href="Christine%20Keeler">Christine Keeler</a> (1942–2017), born in 1942, left school at 15 with no qualifications and took a series of short-lived jobs in shops, offices and cafés. She aspired to be a model, and at 16 had a photograph published in "<a href="Tit-Bits">Tit-Bits</a>" magazine. In August 1959, she found work as a topless showgirl at Murray's Cabaret Club in Beak Street, <a href="Soho">Soho</a>. This long-established club attracted a distinguished clientele who, Keeler wrote, "could look but could not touch". Shortly after starting at Murray's, Keeler was introduced to a client, the society <a href="Doctor%20of%20Osteopathic%20Medicine">osteopath</a> <a href="Stephen%20Ward">Stephen Ward</a>. Captivated by his charm, she agreed to move into his flat, in a relationship she has described as "like brother and sister"—affectionate but not sexual. She left Ward after a few months to become the mistress of the property dealer <a href="Peter%20Rachman">Peter Rachman</a>, and later shared lodgings with <a href="Mandy%20Rice-Davies">Mandy Rice-Davies</a>, a fellow Murray's Club dancer three years her junior. The two girls left Murray's, and attempted without success to pursue careers as freelance models. Keeler also lived for short periods with various boyfriends, but regularly returned to Ward, who had acquired a house in Wimpole Mews. There she met many of Ward's friends, among them <a href="William%20Astor%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Astor">Lord Astor</a>, a long-time patient who was also a political ally of Profumo. She often spent weekends at a riverside cottage that Ward rented on Astor's country estate, <a href="Cliveden">Cliveden</a>, in Buckinghamshire.

Stephen Ward, born in <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a> in 1912, qualified as an osteopath in the United States. After the Second World War he began practising in <a href="Cavendish%20Square">Cavendish Square</a>, London, where he rapidly established a reputation and attracted many distinguished patients. These connections, together with his personal charm, brought him considerable social success. In his spare time Ward attended art classes at the <a href="Slade%20School%20of%20Fine%20Art">Slade school</a>, and developed a profitable sideline in portrait sketches. In 1960 he was commissioned by "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" to provide a series of portraits of national and international figures. These included members of the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">Royal Family</a>, among them <a href="Prince%20Philip">Prince Philip</a> and <a href="Princess%20Margaret">Princess Margaret</a>.

Ward hoped to visit the Soviet Union to draw portraits of Russian leaders. To help him, one of his patients, the "<a href="Daily%20Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>" editor <a href="Colin%20Coote">Sir Colin Coote</a>, arranged an introduction to <a href="Yevgeny%20Ivanov%20%28spy%29">Yevgeny Ivanov</a> (anglicised as "Eugene"), listed as a naval attaché at the Soviet Embassy. British Intelligence (<a href="MI5">MI5</a>) knew from the double-agent <a href="Oleg%20Penkovsky">Oleg Penkovsky</a> that Ivanov was an intelligence officer in the Soviet <a href="Main%20Intelligence%20Directorate%20%28Russia%29">GRU</a>. Ward and Ivanov became firm friends. Ivanov frequently visited Ward at Wimpole Mews, where he met Keeler and Rice-Davies, and sometimes joined Ward's weekend parties at the Cliveden cottage. MI5 considered Ivanov a potential defector, and sought Ward's help to this end, providing him with a case officer known as "Woods". Ward was later used by the British Foreign Office as a <a href="Track%20II%20diplomacy">backchannel</a>, through Ivanov, to the Soviet Union, and was involved in unofficial diplomacy at the time of the 1962 <a href="Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>. His closeness to Ivanov raised concerns about his loyalty; according to Lord Denning's September 1963 report, Ivanov often asked Ward questions about British foreign policy, and Ward did his best to provide answers.

During the weekend of 8–9 July 1961 Keeler was among several guests of Ward at the <a href="Cliveden%23Spring%20Cottage">Cliveden cottage</a>. That same weekend, at the <a href="Cliveden">main house</a>, John and Valerie Profumo were among the large gathering from the worlds of politics and the arts which Astor was hosting in honour of <a href="Ayub%20Khan%20%28President%20of%20Pakistan%29">Ayub Khan</a>, the president of Pakistan. On the Saturday evening, Ward's and Astor's parties mingled at the Cliveden swimming pool, which Ward and his guests had permission to use. Keeler, who had been swimming naked, was introduced to Profumo while trying to cover herself with a skimpy towel. She was, Profumo informed his son many years later, "a very pretty girl and very sweet". Keeler did not know, initially, who Profumo was, but was impressed that he was the husband of a famous film star and was prepared to have "a bit of fun" with him. <a href="William%20Shepherd%20%28British%20politician%29">William Shepherd</a>, an MP trusted by MI5, insisted that over the years he often saw Profumo at louche nightspots, including Murray's Cabaret Club during the time that Keeler had worked there, which made it certain that Profumo knew Keeler before the Cliveden party. Shepherd suggested that Profumo was the original owner of the gun used in the shooting incident (see below). 

The next afternoon the two parties reconvened at the pool, joined by Ivanov, who had arrived that morning. There followed what Lord Denning described as "a light-hearted and frolicsome bathing party, where everyone was in bathing costumes and nothing indecent took place at all". Profumo was greatly attracted to Keeler, and promised to be in touch with her. Ward asked Ivanov to accompany Keeler back to London where, according to Keeler, they had sex. Most commentators doubt this—Keeler was generally outspoken about her conquests, yet said nothing about sex with Ivanov until she informed a newspaper 18 months later.

On 12 July Ward reported on the weekend's events to MI5. He told Woods that Ivanov and Profumo had met and that the latter had shown considerable interest in Keeler. Ward also stated that he had been asked by Ivanov for information about the future arming of <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> with atomic weapons. This request for military information did not greatly disturb MI5, who expected a GRU officer to ask such questions. Profumo's interest in Keeler was an unwelcome complication in their plans to use her in a <a href="Clandestine%20HUMINT%20asset%20recruiting%23Love%2C%20honeypots%2C%20and%20recruitment">honey trap operation</a> against Ivanov, to help secure his defection. Woods therefore referred the issue to MI5's director-general, <a href="Roger%20Hollis">Sir Roger Hollis</a>.

A few days after the Cliveden weekend, Profumo contacted Keeler. The affair that ensued was brief; some commentators have suggested that it ended after a few weeks, while others believe that it continued, with decreasing fervour, until December 1961. The relationship was characterised by Keeler as an unromantic relationship without expectations, a "screw of convenience", although she also states that Profumo hoped for a longer-term commitment and that he offered to set her up in a flat. More than 20 years later, Profumo described Keeler in conversation with his son as someone who "seem[ed] to like sexual intercourse", but who was "completely uneducated", with no conversation beyond make-up, hair and gramophone records. 

The couple usually met at Wimpole Mews, when Ward was absent, although once, when Hobson was away, Profumo took Keeler to his home at <a href="Chester%20Terrace">Chester Terrace</a> in <a href="Regent%27s%20Park">Regent's Park</a>. On one occasion he borrowed a <a href="Bentley">Bentley</a> from his ministerial colleague <a href="John%20Hare%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Blakenham">John Hare</a> and took Keeler for a drive around London, and another time the couple had a drink with <a href="George%20Ward%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Ward%20of%20Witley">Viscount Ward</a>, the former <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Air">Secretary of State for Air</a>. During their time together, Profumo gave Keeler a few small presents, and once, a sum of £20 as a gift for her mother. Keeler maintains that although Stephen Ward asked her to obtain information from Profumo about the deployment of nuclear weapons, she did not do so. Profumo was equally adamant that no such discussions took place.

On 9 August, Profumo was interviewed informally by <a href="Norman%20Brook%2C%201st%20Baron%20Normanbrook">Sir Norman Brook</a>, the <a href="Cabinet%20Secretary%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Cabinet Secretary</a>, who had been advised by Hollis of Profumo's involvement with the Ward circle. Brook warned the minister of the dangers of mixing with Ward's group, since MI5 were at this stage unsure of Ward's dependability. It is possible that Brook asked Profumo to help MI5 in its efforts to secure Ivanov's defection—a request which Profumo declined. Although Brook did not indicate knowledge of Profumo's relationship with Keeler, Profumo may have suspected that he knew. That same day, Profumo wrote Keeler a letter, beginning "Darling ...", cancelling an assignation they had made for the following day. Some commentators have assumed that this letter ended the association; Keeler insisted that the affair ended later, after her persistent refusals to stop living with Ward.

In October 1961 Keeler accompanied Ward to <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a>, then a run-down district of London replete with West Indian music clubs and cannabis dealers. At the Rio Café they encountered <a href="Aloysius%20Gordon">Aloysius "Lucky" Gordon</a>, a Jamaican jazz singer with a history of violence and petty crime. He and Keeler embarked on an affair which, in her own accounts, was marked by equal measures of violence and tenderness on his part. Gordon became very possessive towards Keeler, jealous of her other social contacts. He began confronting her friends, and often telephoned her at unsocial hours. In November Keeler left Wimpole Mews and moved to a flat in <a href="Dolphin%20Square">Dolphin Square</a>, overlooking the Thames at <a href="Pimlico">Pimlico</a>, where she entertained friends and perhaps clients. When Gordon continued to harass her he was arrested by the police and charged with assault. Keeler later agreed to drop the charge.

In July 1962 the first inklings of a possible Profumo-Keeler-Ivanov triangle had been hinted, in coded terms, in the gossip column of the society magazine "<a href="Queen%20%28magazine%29">Queen</a>". Under the heading "Sentences I'd like to hear the end of" appeared the wording: "... called in MI5 because every time the chauffeur-driven <a href="ZiL">Zils</a> drew up at her "front" door, out of her "back" door into a chauffeur-driven <a href="Humber%20Limited">Humber</a> slipped..." Keeler was then in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> with Rice-Davies, in an abortive attempt to launch their modelling careers there. On her return, to counter Gordon's threats, Keeler formed a relationship with <a href="Johnny%20Edgecombe">Johnny Edgecombe</a>, an ex-merchant seaman from <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a>, with whom she lived for a while in <a href="Brentford">Brentford</a>, just west of London. Edgecombe was similarly possessive; he and Gordon clashed violently on 27 October 1962, when Edgecombe slashed his rival with a knife. Keeler broke with Edgecombe shortly afterwards because of his domineering behaviour.

On 14 December 1962 Keeler and Rice-Davies were together at 17 Wimpole Mews when Edgecombe arrived, demanding to see Keeler. When he was not allowed in, he fired several shots at the front door. Shortly afterwards Edgecombe was arrested and charged with attempted murder and other offences. In brief press accounts, Keeler was described as "a free-lance model" and "Miss Marilyn Davies" as "an actress". In the wake of the incident, Keeler began to talk indiscreetly about Ward, Profumo, Ivanov and the Edgecombe shooting. Among those to whom she told her story was <a href="John%20Lewis%20%28British%20politician%29">John Lewis</a>, a former <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> MP whom she had met by chance in a night club. Lewis, a long-standing enemy of Ward, passed the information to his one-time parliamentary colleague George Wigg, who began his own investigation.

On 22 January 1963 the Soviet government, sensing a possible scandal, recalled Ivanov. Aware of increasing public interest, Keeler attempted to sell her story to the national newspapers. The Radcliffe tribunal's ongoing inquiry into press behaviour during the Vassall case was making newspapers nervous, and only two showed interest in Keeler's story: the "<a href="Sunday%20Mirror">Sunday Pictorial</a>" and the "<a href="News%20of%20the%20World">News of the World</a>". As the latter would not join an auction, Keeler accepted the "Pictorial"s offer of a £200 down payment and a further £800 when the story was published. The paper retained a copy of the "Darling" letter. The "News of the World" then alerted Ward and Astor—whose names had been mentioned by Keeler—and they in turn informed Profumo. When Profumo's lawyers tried to persuade Keeler not to publish, the compensation she demanded was so large that Profumo's lawyers considered charges of extortion. Ward informed the "Pictorial" that Keeler's story was largely false, and that he and others would sue if it was printed, whereupon the paper withdrew its offer, although Keeler kept the £200.

Keeler then gave details of her affair with Profumo to a police officer, who did not pass on this information to MI5 or the legal authorities. By this time, many of Profumo's political colleagues had heard rumours of his entanglement, and of the existence of a potentially incriminating letter. Nevertheless, his denials were accepted by the government's principal law officers and the Conservative <a href="Chief%20Whip">Chief Whip</a>, although with some private scepticism. Macmillan, mindful of the injustice done to Galbraith on the basis of rumours, was determined to support his minister, and took no action.

Edgecombe's trial began on 14 March but Keeler, one of the Crown's key witnesses, was missing. She had, without informing the court, gone to Spain, although at this stage her whereabouts were unknown. Her unexplained absence caused a press sensation. Every newspaper knew the rumours linking Keeler with Profumo, but refrained from reporting any direct connection; in the wake of the Radcliffe inquiry they were, in Wigg's later words, "willing to wound but afraid to strike". They could only hint, by front-page juxtapositions of stories and photographs, that Profumo might be connected to Keeler's disappearance. Despite her absence the judge proceeded with the case; Edgecombe was found guilty on a lesser charge of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. A few days after the trial, on 21 March, the satirical magazine "<a href="Private%20Eye">Private Eye</a>" printed the most detailed summary so far of the rumours, with the main characters lightly disguised: "Mr James Montesi", "Miss Gaye Funloving", "Dr Spook" and "Vladimir Bolokhov".

The newly elected leader of the opposition Labour Party, <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, was initially advised by his colleagues to have nothing to do with Wigg's private dossier on the Profumo rumours. On 21 March, with the press furore over the "missing witness" at its height, the party changed its stance. During a House of Commons debate, Wigg used <a href="parliamentary%20privilege">parliamentary privilege</a> to ask the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> to categorically deny the truth of rumours connecting "a minister" to Keeler, Rice-Davies and the Edgecombe shooting. He did not name Profumo, who was not in the House. Later in the debate <a href="Barbara%20Castle">Barbara Castle</a>, the Labour MP for <a href="Blackburn%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Blackburn</a>, referred to the "missing witness" and hinted at a possible perversion of justice. The Home Secretary, <a href="Henry%20Brooke%2C%20Baron%20Brooke%20of%20Cumnor">Henry Brooke</a>, refused to comment, adding that Wigg and Castle should "seek other means of making these insinuations if they are prepared to substantiate them".

At the conclusion of the debate the government's law officers and Chief Whip met, and decided that Profumo should assert his innocence in a personal statement to the House. Such statements are, by long-standing tradition, made on the particular honour of the member and are accepted by the House without question. In the early hours of 22 March Profumo and his lawyers met with ministers and together agreed an appropriate wording. Later that morning Profumo made his statement to a crowded House. He acknowledged friendships with Keeler and Ward, the former of whom, he said, he had last seen in December 1961. He had met "a Mr Ivanov" twice, also in 1961. He stated: "There was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler", and added: "I shall not hesitate to issue writs for libel and slander if scandalous allegations are made or repeated <a href="Parliamentary%20privilege%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">outside the House</a>." That afternoon, Profumo was photographed at <a href="Sandown%20Park%20Racecourse">Sandown Park Racecourse</a> in the company of the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Mother</a>.

While officially the matter was considered closed, many individual MPs had doubts, although none openly expressed disbelief at this stage. Wigg later said that he left the House that morning "with black rage in my heart because I knew what the facts were. I knew the truth." Most newspapers were editorially non-committal; only "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", under the headline "Mr Profumo clears the air", stated openly that the statement should be taken at its face value. Within a few days press attention was distracted by the re-emergence of Keeler, in Madrid. She expressed astonishment at the fuss her absence had caused, adding that her friendship with Profumo and his wife was entirely innocent and that she had many friends in important positions. She claimed that she had not deliberately missed the Edgecombe trial but had been confused about the date. She was required to forfeit her <a href="recognizance">recognizance</a> of £40, but no other action was taken against her.

Shortly after Profumo's Commons statement, Ward appeared on <a href="ITN">Independent Television News</a>, where he endorsed Profumo's version and dismissed all rumours and insinuations as "baseless". Ward's own activities had become a matter of official concern, and on 1 April the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a> began to investigate his affairs. They interviewed 140 of his friends, associates and patients, maintained a 24-hour watch on his home, and tapped his telephone—this last action requiring direct authorisation from Brooke. Among those who gave statements was Keeler, who contradicted her earlier assurances and confirmed her sexual relationship with Profumo, providing corroborative details of the interior of the Chester Terrace house. The police put pressure on reluctant witnesses; Rice-Davies was remanded to <a href="Holloway%20Prison">Holloway Prison</a> for a driving licence offence and held there for eight days until she agreed to testify against Ward. Meanwhile, Profumo was awarded costs and £50 damages against the British distributors of an Italian magazine that had printed a story hinting at his guilt. He donated the proceeds to an army charity.
This did not deter "Private Eye" from including "Sextus Profano" in their parody of <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Gibbon</a>'s "<a href="Decline%20and%20Fall%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</a>".

On 18 April Keeler was attacked at the home of a friend. She accused Gordon, who was arrested and held. According to Knightley and Kennedy's account, the police offered to drop the charges if Gordon would testify against Ward, but he refused. The effects of the police inquiry were proving ruinous to Ward, whose practice was collapsing rapidly. On 7 May he met Macmillan's private secretary, <a href="Timothy%20Bligh">Timothy Bligh</a>, to ask that the police inquiry into his affairs be halted. He added that he had been covering for Profumo, whose Commons statement was substantially false. Bligh took notes but failed to take action. On 19 May Ward wrote to Brooke, with essentially the same request as that to Bligh, to be told that the Home Secretary had no power to interfere with the police inquiry. Ward then gave details to the press, but no paper would print the story. He also wrote to Wilson, who showed the letter to Macmillan. Although privately disdainful of Wilson's motives, after discussions with Hollis the prime minister was sufficiently concerned about Ward's general activities to ask the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, <a href="Reginald%20Manningham-Buller%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Dilhorne">Lord Dilhorne</a>, to inquire into possible security breaches.

On 31 May, at the start of the parliamentary <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a> recess, the Profumos flew to Venice for a short holiday. At their hotel they received a message asking him to return as soon as possible. Believing that his bluff had been called, Profumo then told his wife the truth, and they decided to return immediately. They found that Macmillan was on holiday in Scotland. On Tuesday 4 June Profumo confessed the truth to Bligh, confirming that he had lied, and resigned from the government and from Parliament. Bligh informed Macmillan of these events by telephone. The resignation was announced on 5 June, when the formal exchange of letters between Profumo and Macmillan was published. "The Times" called Profumo's lies "a great tragedy for the probity of public life in Britain"; the "Daily Mail" recorded Profumo's fall and disgrace as the price required when public figures fell short of the expected standards of integrity. The "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" hinted that not all the truth had been told, and referred to "skeletons in many cupboards".

Gordon's trial for the attack on Keeler began on the day Profumo's resignation was made public. He maintained that his innocence would be established by two witnesses who, the police told the court, could not be found. On 7 June, principally on the evidence of Keeler, Gordon was found guilty and sentenced to three years' imprisonment. The following day, Ward was arrested and charged with immorality offences. On 9 June, freed from Profumo's libel threats, the "News of the World" published "The Confessions of Christine", an account which helped to fashion the public image of Ward as a sexual predator and probable tool of the Soviets. The "<a href="Sunday%20Mirror">Sunday Mirror</a>" (formerly the "Sunday Pictorial") printed Profumo's "Darling" letter.

In advance of the House of Commons debate on Profumo's resignation, due 17 June, David Watt in "The Spectator" defined Macmillan's position as "an intolerable dilemma from which he can only escape by being proved either ludicrously naïve or incompetent or deceitful—or all three". Meanwhile, the press speculated about possible Cabinet resignations, and several ministers felt it necessary to demonstrate their loyalty to the prime minister. In a BBC interview on 13 June <a href="Quintin%20Hogg%2C%20Baron%20Hailsham%20of%20St%20Marylebone">Lord Hailsham</a>, holder of several ministerial offices, denounced Profumo in a manner which, according to "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>"s reporter, "had to be seen to be believed". Hailsham insisted that "a great party is not to be brought down because of a squalid affair between a woman of easy virtue and a proven liar".

In the debate, Wilson concentrated almost exclusively on the extent to which the prime minister and his colleagues had been dilatory in not identifying a clear security risk arising from Profumo's association with Ward and his circle. Macmillan responded that he should not be held culpable for believing a colleague who had repeatedly asserted his innocence. He mentioned the false allegations against Galbraith, and the failure of the security services to share their detailed information with him. In the general debate the sexual aspects of the scandal were fully discussed; <a href="Nigel%20Birch%2C%20Baron%20Rhyl">Nigel Birch</a>, the Conservative MP for <a href="West%20Flintshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">West Flintshire</a>, referred to Keeler as a "professional prostitute" and asked rhetorically: "What are whores about?" Keeler was otherwise branded a "tart" and a "poor little slut". Ward was vilified throughout as a likely Soviet agent; one Conservative referred to "the treason of Dr Ward". Most Conservatives, whatever their reservations, were supportive of Macmillan, with only Birch suggesting that he should consider retirement. In the subsequent vote on the government's handling of the affair, 27 Conservatives abstained, reducing the government's majority to 69. Most newspapers considered the extent of the defection significant, and several forecast that Macmillan would soon resign.

After the parliamentary debate, newspapers published further sensational stories, hinting at widespread immorality within Britain's governing class. A story emanating from Rice-Davies concerned a naked masked man, who acted as a waiter at sex parties; rumours suggested that he was a cabinet minister, or possibly a member of the Royal Family. <a href="Malcolm%20Muggeridge">Malcolm Muggeridge</a> in the "Sunday Mirror" wrote of "The Slow, Sure Death of the Upper Classes". On 21 June Macmillan instructed Lord Denning, the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Rolls">Master of the Rolls</a>, to investigate and report on the growing range of rumours. Ward's committal proceedings began a week later, at Marylebone magistrates' court, where the Crown's evidence was fully reported in the press. Ward was committed for trial on charges of "living off the earnings of prostitution" and "procuration of girl under twenty-one", and released on bail.

With the Ward case now "<a href="sub%20judice">sub judice</a>", the press pursued related stories. "The People" reported that <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a> had begun an inquiry, in parallel with Denning's, into "homosexual practices as well as sexual laxity" among civil servants, military officers and MPs. On 24 June the "Daily Mirror", under a banner heading "Prince Philip and the Profumo Scandal", dismissed what it termed the "foul rumour" that the prince had been involved in the affair, without disclosing the nature of the rumour.

Ward's trial began at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a> on 28 July. He was charged with living off the earnings of Keeler, Rice-Davies and two other prostitutes, and with procuring women under 21 to have sex with other persons. The thrust of the prosecution's case related to Keeler and Rice-Davies, and turned on whether the small contributions to household expenses or loan repayments they had given to Ward while living with him amounted to his living off their prostitution. Ward's approximate income at the time, from his practice and from his portraiture, had been around £5,500 a year, a substantial sum at that time. In his speeches and examination of witnesses, the prosecuting counsel <a href="Mervyn%20Griffith-Jones">Mervyn Griffith-Jones</a> portrayed Ward as representing "the very depths of lechery and depravity". The judge, <a href="Archibald%20Pellow%20Marshall">Sir Archie Marshall</a>, was equally hostile, drawing particular attention to the fact that none of Ward's supposed society friends had been prepared to speak up for him. Towards the end of the trial, news came that Gordon's conviction for assault had been overturned; Marshall did not disclose to the jury that Gordon's witnesses had turned up and testified that Keeler, a key prosecution witness against Ward, had given false evidence at Gordon's trial.

After listening to Marshall's damning summing-up, on the evening of 30 July Ward took an overdose of sleeping tablets and was taken to hospital. On the next day he was found guilty "in absentia" on the charges relating to Keeler and Rice-Davies, and acquitted on the other counts. Sentence was postponed until Ward was fit to appear, but on 3 August he died without regaining consciousness.

Lord Denning's report was awaited with great anticipation by the public. Published on 26 September, it concluded that there had been no security leaks in the Profumo affair and that the security services and government ministers had acted appropriately. Profumo had been guilty of an "indiscretion", but no one could doubt his loyalty. Denning also found no evidence to link members of the government with associated scandals such as the "man in the mask". He laid most of the blame for the affair on Ward, an "utterly immoral" man whose diplomatic activities were "misconceived and misdirected". Although "The Spectator" considered that the report marked the end of the affair, many commentators were disappointed with its content. Young found many questions unanswered and some of the reasoning defective, while Davenport-Hines, writing long after the event, condemns the report as disgraceful, slipshod and prurient.

After the Denning Report, in defiance of general expectations that he would resign shortly, Macmillan announced his intention to stay on. On the eve of the Conservative Party's annual conference in October 1963 he fell ill; his condition was less serious than he imagined, and his life was not in danger but, convinced he had cancer, he resigned abruptly. His successor as prime minister was <a href="Alec%20Douglas-Home">Lord Home</a>, who renounced his peerage and served as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201964">October 1964 general election</a> the Conservative Party was narrowly defeated, and Wilson became prime minister. A later commentator opined that the Profumo affair had destroyed the old, aristocratic Conservative party: "It wouldn't be too much to say that the Profumo scandal was the necessary prelude to the new Toryism, based on meritocracy, which would eventually emerge under Margaret Thatcher". "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>" suggested that the Profumo affair had effected a fundamental and permanent change in relations between politicians and press. Davenport-Hines posits a longer-term consequence of the affair—the gradual ending of traditional notions of deference: "Authority, however disinterested, well-qualified and experienced, was [after June 1963] increasingly greeted with suspicion rather than trust".
After expressing his "deep remorse" to the prime minister, to his constituents and to the Conservative Party, Profumo disappeared from public view. In April 1964 he began working as a volunteer at the <a href="Toynbee%20Hall">Toynbee Hall</a> settlement, a charitable organisation based in <a href="Spitalfields">Spitalfields</a> which supports the most deprived residents in the East End of London. Profumo continued his association with the settlement for the remainder of his life, at first in a menial capacity, then as administrator, fund-raiser, council member, chairman and finally president. His charitable work was recognised when he was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Companion of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in 1975. He was later described by <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> as a national hero, and was a guest at her 80th birthday celebrations in 2005. His marriage to Valerie Hobson endured until her death in 1998; Profumo died, aged 90, on 9 March 2006.

In December 1963 Keeler admitted her perjury at Gordon's June trial, and subsequently served six months in prison. After two brief failed marriages which produced two children, she largely lived alone until she died in December 2017. Most of the considerable amount she made from newspaper stories was dissipated by legal fees; during the 1970s, she said, "I was not living, I was surviving". She published several inconsistent accounts of her life, in which Ward has been variously represented as a "gentleman", her truest love, a Soviet spy, and a traitor ranking alongside <a href="Kim%20Philby">Philby</a>, <a href="Guy%20Burgess">Burgess</a> and <a href="Donald%20Maclean%20%28spy%29">Maclean</a>. She also claimed that Profumo impregnated her and that she subsequently underwent a painful abortion. Her portrait, by Ward, was acquired by the <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Portrait Gallery</a> in 1984. Christine Keeler died on 4 December 2017.   Rice-Davies enjoyed a more successful post-scandal career, as nightclub owner, businesswoman, minor actress and novelist. She was married three times, in what she described as her "slow descent into respectability". Of adverse press publicity she observed: "Like royalty, I simply do not complain". Mandy Rice-Davies died on 18 December 2014.

Ward's role on behalf of MI5 was confirmed in 1982, when "The Sunday Times" located his former contact "Woods". Although Denning always asserted that Ward's trial and conviction were fair and proper, most commentators believe that it was deeply flawed—an "historical injustice" according to Davenport-Hines, who argues that the trial was an act of political revenge. One High Court judge said privately that he would have stopped the trial before it reached the jury. The human rights lawyer <a href="Geoffrey%20Robertson">Geoffrey Robertson</a> has campaigned for the case to be reopened on several grounds, including the premature scheduling of the trial, lack of evidence to support the main charges, and various misdirections by the trial judge in his summing up. Above all, the judge failed to advise the jury of the evidence revealed in the Gordon appeal that Keeler, the prosecution's chief witness against Ward, had committed perjury at the Gordon trial. In January 2014 Ward's case was being considered by the <a href="Criminal%20Cases%20Review%20Commission">Criminal Cases Review Commission</a>, which has the power to investigate suspected miscarriages of justice and refer cases to the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Court of Appeal</a>.

After his recall in January 1963, Ivanov disappeared for several decades. In 1992 his memoirs, "The Naked Spy", were serialised in "The Sunday Times". When this account was challenged by Profumo's lawyers, the publishers removed offending material. In August 2015, "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" newspaper published a preview of a forthcoming history of Soviet intelligence activities, by Jonathan Haslam. This book suggests that the relationship between Ivanov and Profumo was closer than the latter has admitted. It is alleged that Ivanov visited Profumo's home, and that such was the slackness of security arrangements that the Russian was able to photograph sensitive documents left lying about in the minister's study.

Keeler describes meeting Ivanov in Moscow, in 1993; she also records that he died the following year. Astor was deeply upset at finding himself under police investigation, and by the social ostracism that followed the Ward trial. After his death in 1966, Cliveden was sold. It became first the property of <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a>, and later a luxury hotel. Rachman, who had first come to public notice as a sometime boyfriend of Keeler and Rice-Davies, was revealed as an unscrupulous <a href="slumlord">slum landlord</a>; the word "Rachmanism" entered English dictionaries as the standard term for landlords who exploit or intimidate their tenants.

There have been several dramatised versions of the Profumo affair.

It is home to several professional sports franchises, including the <a href="Winnipeg%20Blue%20Bombers">Winnipeg Blue Bombers</a> (<a href="Canadian%20football">Canadian football</a>), the <a href="Winnipeg%20Jets">Winnipeg Jets</a> (<a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a>), <a href="Manitoba%20Moose">Manitoba Moose</a> (ice hockey), <a href="Valour%20FC">Valour FC</a> (<a href="soccer">soccer</a>), and the <a href="Winnipeg%20Goldeyes">Winnipeg Goldeyes</a> (<a href="baseball">baseball</a>).

Winnipeg lies at the <a href="confluence">confluence</a> of the <a href="Assiniboine%20River">Assiniboine</a> and the <a href="Red%20River%20Valley">Red River of the North</a>, a location now known as "<a href="The%20Forks%2C%20Winnipeg">The Forks</a>". This point was at the crossroads of <a href="canoe">canoe</a> routes travelled by <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> before European contact. Winnipeg is named after nearby <a href="Lake%20Winnipeg">Lake Winnipeg</a>; the name is a transcription of the <a href="Cree%20language">Western Cree</a> words for muddy or brackish water. Evidence provided by archaeology, <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s, <a href="rock%20art">rock art</a> and oral history indicates that native peoples used the area in prehistoric times for camping, harvesting, hunting, tool making, fishing, trading and, farther north, for agriculture.

Estimates of the date of first settlement in this area range from 11,500 years ago for a site southwest of the present city to 6,000 years ago at The Forks. In 1805, Canadian colonists observed First Nations peoples engaged in farming activity along the Red River. The practice quickly expanded, driven by the demand by traders for provisions. The rivers provided an extensive transportation network linking northern First Peoples with those to the south along the <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> and <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> rivers. The <a href="Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a> made some of the first maps on <a href="birch%20bark">birch bark</a>, which helped <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>rs navigate the waterways of the area.

<a href="Pierre%20Gaultier%20de%20Varennes%2C%20sieur%20de%20La%20V%C3%A9rendrye">Sieur de La Vérendrye</a> built the first fur <a href="trading%20post">trading post</a> on the site in 1738, called <a href="Fort%20Rouge%20%28fortification%29">Fort Rouge</a>. French trading continued at this site for several decades before the arrival of the British <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> after France ceded the territory following its defeat in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>. Many French men who were trappers <a href="Marriage%20%27%C3%A0%20la%20fa%C3%A7on%20du%20pays%27">married First Nations women</a>; their mixed-race children hunted, traded, and lived in the area. They gradually developed as an ethnicity known as the <a href="M%C3%A9tis%20people%20%28Canada%29">Métis</a> because of sharing a traditional culture.

<a href="Thomas%20Douglas%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Selkirk">Lord Selkirk</a> was involved with the first permanent settlement (known as the <a href="Red%20River%20Colony">Red River Colony</a>), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century. The <a href="North%20West%20Company">North West Company</a> built <a href="Fort%20Gibraltar">Fort Gibraltar</a> in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built <a href="Fort%20Douglas%20%28Canada%29">Fort Douglas</a> in 1812, both in the area of present-day Winnipeg. The two companies competed fiercely over trade. The Métis and Lord Selkirk's settlers fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Seven%20Oaks">Battle of Seven Oaks</a> in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long rivalry. Fort Gibraltar was renamed <a href="Fort%20Garry">Fort Garry</a> in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 and it was not rebuilt until 1835. A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of the wall, is near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway Avenue in downtown Winnipeg.

In 1869–70, present-day Winnipeg was the site of the <a href="Red%20River%20Rebellion">Red River Rebellion</a>, a conflict between the local provisional government of Métis, led by <a href="Louis%20Riel">Louis Riel</a>, and newcomers from eastern Canada. General <a href="Garnet%20Wolseley%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Wolseley">Garnet Wolseley</a> was sent to put down the uprising. The <a href="Manitoba%20Act">Manitoba Act</a> of 1870 made Manitoba the <a href="provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">fifth province</a> of the three-year-old <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Canadian Confederation</a>. <a href="Treaty%201">Treaty 1</a>, which encompassed the city and much of the surrounding area, was signed on 3 August 1871 by representatives of the Crown and local Indigenous groups, comprising the Brokenhead Ojibway, Sagkeeng, Long Plain, Peguis, Roseau River Anishinabe, Sandy Bay and Swan Lake communities. On 8 November 1873, Winnipeg was incorporated as a city, with the Selkirk settlement as its nucleus. Métis legislator and interpreter <a href="James%20McKay%20%28fur%20trader%29">James McKay</a> named the city. Winnipeg's mandate was to govern and provide municipal services to citizens attracted to trade expansion between <a href="Fort%20Garry">Upper Fort Garry</a> / <a href="Lower%20Fort%20Garry">Lower Fort Garry</a> and <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul, Minnesota</a>.

Winnipeg developed rapidly after the coming of the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly Eastern Europeans, from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier <a href="Thomas%20Greenway">Thomas Greenway</a> controversially ending legislative bilingualism and <a href="Manitoba%20Schools%20Question">removing funding for French Catholic Schools</a> in 1890.

By 1911, Winnipeg was Canada's third-largest city. However, the city faced financial difficulty when the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> opened in 1914. The canal reduced reliance on Canada's rail system for international trade; the increase in shipping traffic helped <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> to surpass Winnipeg in both prosperity and population by the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

More than 30,000 workers walked off their jobs in May 1919 in what came to be known as the <a href="Winnipeg%20general%20strike">Winnipeg general strike</a>. The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the activity of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919 when the <a href="Riot%20Act">Riot Act</a> was read and a group of <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as "Bloody Saturday"; the event polarized the population. One of the leaders of the strike, <a href="J.%20S.%20Woodsworth">J. S. Woodsworth</a>, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the <a href="Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a>, which later became the <a href="New%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Canada%29">New Democratic Party</a>.

The <a href="Manitoba%20Legislative%20Building">Manitoba Legislative Building</a>, constructed mainly of <a href="Tyndall%20stone">Tyndall stone</a>, opened in 1920; its dome supports a bronze statue finished in gold leaf, titled "Eternal Youth and the Spirit of Enterprise" (commonly known as the "<a href="Golden%20Boy%20%28Manitoba%29">Golden Boy</a>"). The <a href="stock%20market%20crash%20of%201929">stock market crash of 1929</a> and the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> resulted in widespread unemployment, worsened by drought and low agricultural prices. The Depression ended after the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in 1939. 

In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Battle of Hong Kong</a>, <a href="The%20Winnipeg%20Grenadiers">The Winnipeg Grenadiers</a> were among the first Canadians to engage in combat against Japan. Battalion members who survived combat were taken prisoner and endured brutal treatment in <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> camps. In 1942, the Victory Loan Campaign staged a <a href="If%20Day">mock Nazi invasion</a> of Winnipeg to promote awareness of the stakes of the war in Europe. When the war ended, pent-up demand generated a boom in housing development, although building activity was checked by the <a href="1950%20Red%20River%20flood">1950 Red River flood</a>. The federal government estimated damage at over $26 million, although the province indicated that it was at least double that.

Prior to 1972, Winnipeg was the largest of thirteen cities and towns in a metropolitan area around the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. In 1960 the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg was established to co-ordinate service delivery in the metropolitan region. A consolidated metropolitan "<a href="Amalgamation%20of%20Winnipeg">unicity</a>" government incorporating Winnipeg and its surrounding municipalities was established on 27 July 1971, taking effect in 1972. The <a href="City%20of%20Winnipeg%20Act">City of Winnipeg Act</a> incorporated the current city. In 2003 the City of Winnipeg Act was repealed and replaced with the City of Winnipeg Charter.

Winnipeg experienced a severe economic downturn in advance of the <a href="early%201980s%20recession">early 1980s recession</a>, during which the city incurred closures of prominent businesses, including the "<a href="Winnipeg%20Tribune">Winnipeg Tribune</a>", as well as the <a href="Swift%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Swift's</a> and <a href="Canada%20Packers">Canada Packers</a> meat packing plants. In 1981, Winnipeg was one of the first cities in Canada to sign a tripartite agreement with the provincial and federal governments to redevelop its downtown area, and the three levels of government contributed over $271 million to its development. In 1989, the reclamation and redevelopment of the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">CNR</a> <a href="rail%20yard">rail yard</a>s turned The Forks into Winnipeg's most popular tourist attraction. The city was threatened by the <a href="1997%20Red%20River%20flood">1997 Red River flood</a> as well as further floods in <a href="2009%20Red%20River%20flood">2009</a> and <a href="2011%20Red%20River%20flood">2011</a>, in each of these floods, the <a href="Red%20River%20Floodway">Red River Floodway</a> was used to safely protect the city.

Winnipeg lies at the bottom of the <a href="Red%20River%20Valley">Red River Valley</a>, a flood plain with an extremely flat topography. It is on the eastern edge of the <a href="Canadian%20Prairies">Canadian Prairies</a> in <a href="Western%20Canada">Western Canada</a> and is known as the "Gateway to the West". Winnipeg is bordered by <a href="tallgrass%20prairie">tallgrass prairie</a> to the west and south and the <a href="aspen%20parkland">aspen parkland</a> to the northeast, although most of the native prairie grasses have been removed for agriculture and urbanization. It is relatively close to many large <a href="Canadian%20Shield">Canadian Shield</a> lakes and parks, as well as <a href="Lake%20Winnipeg">Lake Winnipeg</a> (<a href="List%20of%20lakes%20by%20area">the Earth's 11th largest freshwater lake</a>). Winnipeg has North America's largest extant mature urban elm forest. The city has an area of .

Winnipeg has four major rivers: the <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20North">Red</a>, <a href="Assiniboine%20River">Assiniboine</a>, <a href="La%20Salle%20River">La Salle</a> and <a href="Seine%20River%20%28Manitoba%29">Seine</a>. The city was subject to severe flooding in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in <a href="1826%20Red%20River%20flood">1826</a>. Another large flood in <a href="1950%20Red%20River%20flood">1950</a> caused millions of dollars in damage and mass evacuations. This flood prompted <a href="Dufferin%20Roblin">Duff Roblin</a>'s provincial government to build the <a href="Red%20River%20Floodway">Red River Floodway</a> to protect the city; the project began in 1962 and was completed in 1968. In the <a href="1997%20Red%20River%20flood">1997 flood</a>, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, such as <a href="Grand%20Forks%2C%20North%20Dakota">Grand Forks, North Dakota</a>. The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in many <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es during wetter years.

Winnipeg's location in the Canadian Prairies gives it a <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">humid continental climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a> "Dfb"), with warm, humid summers, and long, very cold winters.

Temperatures occasionally drop below . The actual air temperature drops below on average 12.6 days annually and rises above 13.3 days of the year. On average there are 317.8 days per year with measurable sunshine, with July seeing the most on average. With 2353 hours of sunshine per year, Winnipeg is the second sunniest city in Canada. Total annual precipitation (both rain and snow) is just over .<ref name="ce/ref"></ref> Thunderstorms are very common during summer, and sometimes severe enough to produce tornadoes. Low <a href="wind%20chill">wind chill</a> values are a common occurrence in the local climate. The wind chill has gone down as low as and on average there are twelve days of the year that can reach a wind chill below .

The highest temperature ever recorded in Winnipeg was on 11 July 1936 while the highest daily low temperature was on 12 July 1936.

Phil Hartman

Philip Edward Hartmann (September 24, 1948 – May 28, 1998), better known as Phil Hartman, was a Canadian-American actor, comedian, screenwriter and graphic artist. Born in <a href="Brantford">Brantford</a>, Ontario, Hartman and his family moved to the United States in 1958. After graduating from <a href="California%20State%20University%2C%20Northridge">California State University, Northridge</a>, with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands like <a href="Poco">Poco</a> and <a href="America%20%28band%29">America</a>. Hartman joined the comedy group <a href="The%20Groundlings">The Groundlings</a> in 1975 and there helped comedian <a href="Paul%20Reubens">Paul Reubens</a> develop his character <a href="Pee-wee%20Herman">Pee-wee Herman</a>. Hartman co-wrote the screenplay for the film "<a href="Pee-wee%27s%20Big%20Adventure">Pee-wee's Big Adventure</a>" and made recurring appearances as Captain Carl on Reubens' show "<a href="Pee-wee%27s%20Playhouse">Pee-wee's Playhouse</a>".

Hartman garnered fame in 1986 when he joined the sketch comedy show "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>". He won fame for his impressions, particularly of President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, and he stayed on the show for eight seasons. Given the moniker "The Glue" for his ability to hold the show together and help other cast members, Hartman won a <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> for his "SNL" work in 1989. In 1995, after scrapping plans for his own variety show, he starred as Bill McNeal in the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a> "<a href="NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a>". He voiced various roles on "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", most notably <a href="Lionel%20Hutz">Lionel Hutz</a> from seasons 2–9 and <a href="Troy%20McClure">Troy McClure</a> from seasons 2–10. Other Simpsons characters included Lyle Lanley, Mr. Muntz and minor characters. He also had roles in the films "<a href="Houseguest">Houseguest</a>", "<a href="Sgt.%20Bilko">Sgt. Bilko</a>", "<a href="Jingle%20All%20the%20Way">Jingle All the Way</a>", "<a href="Small%20Soldiers">Small Soldiers</a>" and the English <a href="dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">dub</a> of "<a href="Kiki%27s%20Delivery%20Service">Kiki's Delivery Service</a>".

Hartman had been divorced twice before he married Brynn Omdahl in 1987; the couple had two children together. However, their marriage was fractured, due in part to her drug use. On May 28, 1998, Brynn Hartman shot and <a href="Murder%E2%80%93suicide">killed</a> Hartman while he slept in their <a href="Encino%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Encino, Los Angeles</a> home, then <a href="suicide">killed herself</a> several hours later. In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" opined that Hartman was "the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper ... a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with." Hartman was posthumously inducted into <a href="Canada%27s%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Canada's Walk of Fame</a> in 2012 and the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> in 2014.

Phil Hartman was born Philip Edward Hartmann (later dropping one "n") on September 24, 1948, in <a href="Brantford%2C%20Ontario">Brantford, Ontario</a>, Canada. He was the fourth of eight children of Doris Marguerite (Wardell) and Rupert Loebig Hartmann, a salesman specializing in building materials. His parents were <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Catholic</a> and raised their children in that faith. As a child Hartman found affection hard to earn and stated: "I suppose I didn't get what I wanted out of my family life, so I started seeking love and attention elsewhere."

Hartman was ten years old when his family moved to the United States. The family first lived in <a href="Lewiston%2C%20Maine">Lewiston, Maine</a>; before moving to <a href="Meriden%2C%20Connecticut">Meriden, Connecticut</a>; and then the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>. There, Hartman attended <a href="Westchester%20High%20School%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Westchester High School</a> and frequently acted as the class clown. After graduating, Hartman studied art at <a href="Santa%20Monica%20City%20College">Santa Monica City College</a>, dropping out in 1969 to become a <a href="roadie">roadie</a> with a rock band. He returned to school in 1972, this time studying <a href="graphic%20arts">graphic arts</a> at <a href="California%20State%20University%2C%20Northridge">California State University, Northridge</a>. He developed his own graphic arts business, which he operated on his own, creating over 40 album covers for bands including <a href="Poco">Poco</a> and <a href="America%20%28band%29">America</a>, as well as advertising and the logo for <a href="Crosby%2C%20Stills%20%26amp%3B%20Nash">Crosby, Stills & Nash</a>. In the late 1970s, Hartman made his first television appearance on an episode of "<a href="The%20Dating%20Game">The Dating Game</a>"; he won but was stood up by his date.

Working alone as a graphic artist, Hartman frequently amused himself with "flights of voice fantasies". Citing the need for a more social outlet for his talents, Hartman, aged 27, began in 1975 to attend evening comedy classes run by the <a href="California">California</a>-based improvisational comedy group <a href="The%20Groundlings">The Groundlings</a>. While watching one of the troupe's performances, Hartman impulsively decided to climb on stage and join the cast. Phil's first movie appearance was in the 1978 film Stunt Rock directed by Brian Trenchard Smith. After several years of training, paying his way by re-designing the group's logo and merchandise, Hartman formally joined the cast of The Groundlings; by 1979 he had become one of the show's stars.

Hartman met comedian <a href="Paul%20Reubens">Paul Reubens</a> and the two became friends, often collaborating on writing and comedic material. Together they created the character <a href="Pee-wee%20Herman">Pee-wee Herman</a> and developed "<a href="The%20Pee-wee%20Herman%20Show">The Pee-wee Herman Show</a>", a stage performance which also aired on <a href="HBO">HBO</a> in 1981. Hartman played <a href="Captain%20Carl">Captain Carl</a> on "The Pee-wee Herman Show" and returned in the role for the children's show "<a href="Pee-wee%27s%20Playhouse">Pee-wee's Playhouse</a>". Reubens and Hartman made cameos in the 1980 film "<a href="Cheech%20%26amp%3B%20Chong%27s%20Next%20Movie">Cheech & Chong's Next Movie</a>". Hartman co-wrote the script of the 1985 feature film "<a href="Pee-wee%27s%20Big%20Adventure">Pee-wee's Big Adventure</a>" and had a cameo role as a reporter in the film. Although he had considered quitting acting at the age of 36 due to limited opportunities, the success of "Pee-wee's Big Adventure" brought new possibilities and changed his mind. After a creative falling-out with Reubens, Hartman left the Pee-Wee Herman project to pursue other roles.

In addition to his work with Reubens, Hartman recorded a number of voice-over roles. These included appearances on "<a href="The%20Smurfs%20%28TV%20series%29">The Smurfs</a>", "<a href="Challenge%20of%20the%20GoBots">Challenge of the GoBots</a>", "<a href="The%2013%20Ghosts%20of%20Scooby-Doo">The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo</a>", and voicing characters Henry Mitchell and George Wilson on "<a href="Dennis%20the%20Menace%20%281986%20animated%20series%29">Dennis the Menace</a>". Additionally Hartman developed a strong persona providing voice-overs for advertisements.

After appearing in the 1986 films "<a href="Jumpin%27%20Jack%20Flash%20%28film%29">Jumpin' Jack Flash</a>" and "<a href="Three%20Amigos">Three Amigos</a>", Hartman successfully auditioned for <a href="NBC">NBC</a>'s variety show "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" ("SNL") and joined the cast and writing staff. He told the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", "I wanted to do ["SNL"] because I wanted to get the exposure that would give me box-office credibility so I can write movies for myself." In his eight seasons with the show Hartman became known for his impressions, and performed as over 70 different characters. Hartman's original "Saturday Night Live" characters included <a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live%20TV%20show%20sketches%20of%20the%201990s%23Cooking%20with%20the%20Anal%20Retentive%20Chef">Eugene, the Anal Retentive Chef</a> and <a href="Unfrozen%20Caveman%20Lawyer">Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer</a>. His impressions included <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, <a href="Ed%20McMahon">Ed McMahon</a>, <a href="Barbara%20Bush">Barbara Bush</a>, <a href="Charlton%20Heston">Charlton Heston</a>, <a href="Phil%20Donahue">Phil Donahue</a> and <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>; the last was often considered his best-known impression.

Hartman first performed his Clinton impression on an episode of "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show">The Tonight Show</a>". When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked, "I guess I owe you a few apologies", adding later that he "sometimes [felt] a twinge of guilt about [his Clinton impression]". Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: "<a href="I%27m%20not%20a%20doctor%2C%20but%20I%20play%20one%20on%20TV">You're not the president, but you play one on TV</a>. And you're OK, mostly." For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's "post-nasal drip" and the "slight scratchiness" in his voice, as well as his open, "less intimidating" hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose. One of Hartman's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – by the end of the live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.

Backstage at "SNL", Hartman was called "the Glue", a name coined by <a href="Adam%20Sandler">Adam Sandler</a>, according to <a href="Jay%20Mohr">Jay Mohr</a>'s book "<a href="Gasping%20for%20Airtime">Gasping for Airtime</a>". However, according to a biography on Hartman's life entitled "You Might Remember Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman" written by Mike Thomas, author and staff writer for the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>", the nickname was created by "SNL" cast member and Hartman's frequent on-screen collaborator <a href="Jan%20Hooks">Jan Hooks</a>. Hartman often helped other cast members. For example, he aided Hooks in overcoming her <a href="stage%20fright">stage fright</a>. "SNL" creator <a href="Lorne%20Michaels">Lorne Michaels</a> explained the reason for the name: "He kind of held the show together. He gave to everybody and demanded very little. He was very low-maintenance." Michaels also added that Hartman was "the least appreciated" cast member by commentators outside the show, and praised his ability "to do five or six parts in a show where you're playing support or you're doing remarkable character work". Hartman won the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Writing%20for%20a%20Variety%2C%20Music%20or%20Comedy%20Program">Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program</a> for "SNL" in 1989, sharing the award with the show's other writers. He was nominated in the same category in 1987, and individually in 1994 for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Individual%20Performance%20in%20a%20Variety%20or%20Music%20Program">Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program</a>.

After his co-stars <a href="Jon%20Lovitz">Jon Lovitz</a>, <a href="Dennis%20Miller">Dennis Miller</a>, Jan Hooks and <a href="Dana%20Carvey">Dana Carvey</a> had left, Hartman said he felt "like an athlete who's watched all his <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> teammates get traded off into other directions ... It was hard to watch them leave because I sort of felt we were all part of the team that saved the show." This cast turnover contributed to his leaving the show in 1994. Hartman had originally planned to leave the show in 1991, but Michaels convinced him to stay to raise his profile; his portrayal of Clinton contributed to this goal. <a href="Jay%20Leno">Jay Leno</a> offered him the role of his sidekick on "The Tonight Show" but Hartman opted to stay on "SNL". NBC persuaded him to stay on "SNL" by promising him his own comedy–variety show entitled "The Phil Show". He planned to "reinvent the variety form" with "a hybrid, very fast-paced, high energy [show] with sketches, impersonations, pet acts, and performers showcasing their talents". Hartman was to be the show's executive producer and head writer. Before production began, however, the network decided that variety shows were too unpopular and scrapped the series. In a 1996 interview, Hartman noted he was glad the show had been scrapped, as he "would've been sweatin' blood each week trying to make it work". In 1998, he admitted he missed working on "SNL", but had enjoyed the move from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to Southern California.

Hartman became one of the stars of the NBC <a href="situation%20comedy">sitcom</a> "<a href="NewsRadio">NewsRadio</a>" in 1995, portraying radio news anchor Bill McNeal. He signed up after being attracted by the show's writing and use of an <a href="ensemble%20cast">ensemble cast</a>, and joked that he based McNeal on himself with "any ethics and character" removed. Hartman made roughly $50,000 per episode of "NewsRadio". Although the show was critically acclaimed, it was never a ratings hit and cancellation was a regular threat. After the completion of the fourth season, Hartman commented, "We seem to have limited appeal. We're on the edge here, not sure we're going to be picked up or not", but added he was "99 percent sure" the series would be renewed for a fifth season. Hartman had publicly lambasted NBC's decision to repeatedly move "NewsRadio" into different timeslots, but later regretted his comments, saying, "this is a sitcom, for crying out loud, not brain surgery". He also stated that if the sitcom were cancelled "it just will open up other opportunities for me". Although the show was renewed for a fifth season, Hartman died before production began. <a href="Ken%20Tucker">Ken Tucker</a> praised Hartman's performance as McNeal: "A lesser performer ... would have played him as a variation on "<a href="The%20Mary%20Tyler%20Moore%20Show">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s <a href="Ted%20Baxter">Ted Baxter</a>, because that's what Bill was, on paper. But Hartman gave infinite variety to Bill's self-centeredness, turning him devious, cowardly, squeamish, and foolishly bold from week to week." Hartman was posthumously nominated for the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Supporting%20Actor%20-%20Comedy%20Series">Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series</a> in 1998 for his work on "NewsRadio", but lost to <a href="David%20Hyde%20Pierce">David Hyde Pierce</a>.

Hartman provided the <a href="voice%20actor">voices</a> for numerous characters on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> animated series "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", appearing in 52 episodes. He made his first appearance in the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> episode "<a href="Bart%20Gets%20Hit%20by%20a%20Car">Bart Gets Hit by a Car</a>". Although he was originally brought in for a one-time appearance, Hartman enjoyed working on "The Simpsons" and the staff wrote additional parts for him. He voiced the recurring characters <a href="Lionel%20Hutz">Lionel Hutz</a> and <a href="Troy%20McClure">Troy McClure</a>, as well as several one-time and background characters. His favourite part was that of McClure, and he often used this voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of "NewsRadio". He remarked, "My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans." He added "It's the one thing that I do in my life that's almost an avocation. I do it for the pure love of it."

Hartman was popular among the staff of "The Simpsons". <a href="Showrunners">Showrunners</a> <a href="Bill%20Oakley">Bill Oakley</a> and <a href="Josh%20Weinstein">Josh Weinstein</a> stated that they enjoyed his work, and used Hartman as much as possible when working on the show. To give Hartman a larger role, they developed the episode "<a href="A%20Fish%20Called%20Selma">A Fish Called Selma</a>", which focuses on Troy McClure and expands the character's backstory. "The Simpsons" creator <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a> said that he "took [Hartman] for granted because he nailed the joke every time", and that his voice acting could produce "the maximum amount of humor" with any line he was given. Before his death, Hartman had expressed an interest in making a <a href="live%20action">live action</a> film about Troy McClure. Many of "The Simpsons" production staff expressed enthusiasm for the project and offered to help. Hartman said he was "looking forward to [McClure's] live-action movie, publicizing his <a href="Betty%20Ford%20clinic">Betty Ford</a> appearances", and "would love nothing more" than making a film and was prepared to buy the film rights himself in order to make it happen.

Hartman's first starring film role came in 1995's "<a href="Houseguest">Houseguest</a>", alongside <a href="Sinbad%20%28entertainer%29">Sinbad</a>. Other films included "<a href="Greedy%20%28film%29">Greedy</a>", "<a href="Coneheads%20%28film%29">Coneheads</a>", "<a href="Sgt.%20Bilko">Sgt. Bilko</a>", "<a href="So%20I%20Married%20an%20Axe%20Murderer">So I Married an Axe Murderer</a>", "<a href="CB4">CB4</a>", "<a href="Jingle%20All%20the%20Way">Jingle All the Way</a>", "<a href="Kiki%27s%20Delivery%20Service">Kiki's Delivery Service</a>", and "<a href="Small%20Soldiers">Small Soldiers</a>", the last of which was his final theatrically released film. At the same time, he preferred working on television. His other television roles included appearances on episodes of "<a href="The%20John%20Larroquette%20Show">The John Larroquette Show</a>", "<a href="The%20Dana%20Carvey%20Show">The Dana Carvey Show</a>", and the HBO TV film "<a href="The%20Second%20Civil%20War">The Second Civil War</a>" as the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>. He appeared as the kidnapper Randy in the third season <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a> finale of "<a href="3rd%20Rock%20from%20the%20Sun">3rd Rock from the Sun</a>" — a role reportedly written especially for him, but he died before filming of the concluding episode could take place. Executive producer <a href="Bonnie%20and%20Terry%20Turner">Terry Turner</a> decided to recast the part, reshoot and air the finale again, noting: "I have far too much respect for [Hartman] to try to find some clever way of getting around this real tragedy." Hartman made a considerable amount of money from television advertising, earning $300,000 for a series of four commercials for the soft drink <a href="Slice%20%28soft%20drink%29">Slice</a>. He also appeared in advertisements for McDonald's (as Hugh McAttack) and <a href="MCI%20Communications">1-800-Collect</a> (as Max Jerome).

Hartman wrote a number of screenplays that were never produced. In 1986 he began writing a screenplay for a film titled "Mr. Fix-It", and completed the final draft in 1991. <a href="Robert%20Zemeckis">Robert Zemeckis</a> was signed to produce the film, with Gil Bettman hired to direct. Hartman called it "a sort of a merger of horror and comedy, like "<a href="Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a>" and "<a href="Throw%20Momma%20From%20the%20Train">Throw Momma From the Train</a>"", adding, "It's an American nightmare about a family torn asunder. They live next to a toxic dump site, their water supply is poisoned, the mother and son go insane and try to murder each other, the father's face is torn off in a terrible disfiguring accident in the first act. It's heavy stuff, but it's got a good message and a positive, upbeat ending." Zemeckis could not secure studio backing, however, and the project collapsed. Another movie idea involving Hartman's Groundlings character Chick Hazard, Private Eye also fell through.

In contrast to his real-life personality, which was described as "a regular guy and, by all accounts, one of show business' most low-key, decent people", Hartman often played seedy, vain or unpleasant characters as well as comedic villains. He noted that his standard character was a "jerky guy", and described his usual roles as "the weasel parade", citing Lionel Hutz, Bill McNeal, Troy McClure and Ted Maltin from "Jingle All the Way" as examples. Hartman enjoyed playing such roles because he "just want[ed] to be funny, and villains tend to be funny because their foibles are all there to see."

He often played supporting roles, rather than the lead part. He said "throughout my career, I've never been a huge star, but I've made steady progress and that's the way I like it," and "It's fun coming in as the second or third lead. If the movie or TV show bombs, you aren't to blame." Hartman was considered a "utility player" on "SNL" with a "kind of Everyman quality" which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches, often in very distinct roles. <a href="Jan%20Hooks">Jan Hooks</a> stated of his work on "SNL": "Phil never had an ounce of competition. He was a team player. It was a privilege for him, I believe, to play support and do it very well. He was never insulted, no matter how small the role may have been." He was disciplined in his performances, studying the scripts beforehand. Hooks added: "Phil knew how to listen. And he knew how to look you in the eye, and he knew the power of being able to lay back and let somebody else be funny, and then do the reactions. I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian." Film critic <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a> declared that "Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks on "Saturday Night Live" are two of the best comic actors I've ever seen."

Writer and acting coach Paul Ryan noted Hartman's work ethic with his impressions. He assembled a collection of video footage of the figure he was preparing to impersonate and watched this continually until he "completely embodied the person". Ryan concluded that "what made [Hartman's impressions] so funny and spot on was Phil's ability to add that perfect touch that only comes from trial and error and practicing in front of audiences and fellow actors." Hartman described this process as "technical." Journalist Lyle V. Harris said Hartman showed a "rare talent for morphing into ... anybody he wanted to be".

<a href="Ken%20Tucker">Ken Tucker</a> summarized Hartman's comedic style: "He could momentarily fool audiences into thinking he was the straight man, but then he'd cock an eyebrow and give his voice an ironic lilt that delivered a punchline like a fast slider—you barely saw it coming until you started laughing." Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor <a href="Bill%20Murray">Bill Murray</a>: "He's been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in "<a href="Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a>", then the same sort of thing in "<a href="Groundhog%20Day%20%28film%29">Groundhog Day</a>". I tried to imitate it. I couldn't. I wasn't good enough. But I discovered an element of something else, so in a sick kind of way I made myself a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic."

Hartman married Gretchen Lewis in 1970, and they divorced sometime before 1972. He married real estate agent Lisa Strain in 1982, and their marriage lasted three years. Strain told "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" that Hartman was reclusive off screen and "would disappear emotionally ... he'd be in his own world. That passivity made you crazy." Hartman married former model and aspiring actress Brynn Omdahl (born Vicki Jo Omdahl) in November 1987, having met her on a blind date the previous year. Together they had two children, Sean and Birgen Hartman. The marriage had difficulties – Brynn reportedly felt intimidated by her husband's success and was frustrated she could not find any on her own – although neither party wanted a divorce. Hartman considered retiring to save the marriage. He tried to get Brynn acting roles but she became progressively more reliant on narcotics and alcohol, entering <a href="Drug%20rehabilitation">rehab</a> several times. Because of his close friendship with "SNL" associate <a href="Jan%20Hooks">Jan Hooks</a>, Brynn joked on occasion that Hooks and Hartman were married "on some other level".

<a href="Stephen%20Root">Stephen Root</a>, Hartman's "NewsRadio" co-star, felt that few people knew "the real Phil Hartman" as he was "one of those people who never seemed to come out of character," but he nevertheless gave the impression of a family man who cared deeply for his children. In his spare time, Hartman enjoyed driving, flying, sailing, marksmanship, and playing the guitar.

On the evening of May 27, 1998, Brynn Hartman visited the Italian restaurant <a href="Buca%20di%20Beppo">Buca di Beppo</a> in <a href="Encino%2C%20California">Encino, California</a>, with producer and writer <a href="Christine%20Zander">Christine Zander</a>, who said she was "in a good frame of mind". After returning to the couple's nearby home, Brynn had a "heated" argument with her husband, who threatened to leave her if she started using drugs again, after which he went to bed. While Hartman slept, Brynn entered his bedroom sometime before 3:00 a.m. <a href="Pacific%20Time%20Zone">Pacific Daylight Time</a> on May 28 with a .38 caliber handgun and fatally shot him once between the eyes, once in the throat, and once in the upper chest. She was intoxicated and had recently taken <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>.

Brynn drove to the home of her friend Ron Douglas and confessed to the killing, but initially he did not believe her. The pair drove back to the house in separate cars, and Brynn called another friend and confessed a second time. Upon seeing Hartman's body, Douglas called <a href="9-1-1">911</a> at 6:20 a.m. Police subsequently arrived and escorted Douglas and the Hartmans' two children from the premises, by which time Brynn had locked herself in the bedroom and committed <a href="suicide">suicide</a> by shooting herself in her mouth.

Los Angeles police stated Hartman's death was caused by "domestic discord" between the couple. A friend alleged that Brynn "had trouble controlling her anger ... She got attention by losing her temper". A neighbor of the Hartmans told a <a href="CNN">CNN</a> reporter that the couple had been experiencing marital problems: "It's been building, but I didn't think it would lead to this", and actor <a href="Steve%20Guttenberg">Steve Guttenberg</a> said they had been "a very happy couple, and they always had the appearance of being well-balanced."

Other causes for the incident were later suggested. Before committing the act, Brynn was taking the antidepressant drug <a href="Sertraline">Zoloft</a>. A wrongful-death lawsuit was filed in 1999 by Brynn's brother, Gregory Omdahl, against <a href="Pfizer%20Inc.">Pfizer</a>, the drug's manufacturer, and her child's psychiatrist Arthur Sorosky, who provided samples of Zoloft to Brynn. Hartman's friend and former "SNL" colleague <a href="Jon%20Lovitz">Jon Lovitz</a> has accused Hartman's former "NewsRadio" co-star <a href="Andy%20Dick">Andy Dick</a> of re-introducing Brynn to cocaine, causing her to relapse and suffer a nervous breakdown. Dick claims to have known nothing of her condition. In 2006, Lovitz claimed that Dick had approached him at a restaurant and said, "I put the Phil Hartman hex on you; you're the next one to die." Lovitz responded by twice pushing Dick into the bar. The following year at the <a href="Laugh%20Factory">Laugh Factory</a> comedy club in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, Lovitz and Dick had a further altercation over the issue. Dick asserts that he is not at fault in relation to Hartman's death.

Brynn's sister Katharine Omdahl and brother-in-law Mike Wright raised the two Hartman children. Hartman's will stipulated that each child will receive their inheritance over several years after they turn 25. The total value of Hartman's estate was estimated at $1.23 million. In accordance with Hartman's will, his body was <a href="cremated">cremated</a> by <a href="Forest%20Lawn%20Memorial%20Park%2C%20Glendale">Forest Lawn Memorial Park and Mortuary, Glendale, California</a>, and his ashes were scattered over <a href="Santa%20Catalina%20Island%2C%20California">Santa Catalina Island</a>'s Emerald Bay.

NBC executive <a href="Don%20Ohlmeyer">Don Ohlmeyer</a> stated that Hartman "was blessed with a tremendous gift for creating characters that made people laugh. Everyone who had the pleasure of working with Phil knows that he was a man of tremendous warmth, a true professional and a loyal friend." Guttenberg expressed shock at Hartman's death, and <a href="Steve%20Martin">Steve Martin</a> said he was "a deeply funny and very happy person." Matt Groening called him "a master", and director <a href="Joe%20Dante">Joe Dante</a> said, "He was one of those guys who was a dream to work with. I don't know anybody who didn't like him." Dan Snierson of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" concluded that Hartman was "the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper" and "a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with." In 2007, "Entertainment Weekly" ranked Hartman the 87th greatest television icon of all time, and "<a href="Maxim%20%28magazine%29">Maxim</a>" named Hartman the top "Saturday Night Live" performer of all time.

Rehearsals for "The Simpsons" were cancelled on the day of Hartman's death as well as that night's performance by <a href="The%20Groundlings">The Groundlings</a>. The <a href="NewsRadio%20season%205">season five</a> premiere episode of "NewsRadio", "Bill Moves On," finds Hartman's character, Bill McNeal, has died of a heart attack, while the other characters reminisce about his life. Lovitz joined the show in his place from the following episode. A special episode of "Saturday Night Live" commemorating Hartman's work on the show aired on June 13, 1998. Rather than substituting another voice actor, the writers of "The Simpsons" retired Hartman's characters, and the <a href="The%20Simpsons%20%28season%2010%29">season ten</a> episode "<a href="Bart%20the%20Mother">Bart the Mother</a>" (his final appearance on the show) was dedicated to him, as was his final film, "<a href="Small%20Soldiers">Small Soldiers</a>".

At the time of his death, Hartman was preparing to voice <a href="Zapp%20Brannigan">Zapp Brannigan</a>, a character written specifically for him on Groening's second animated series "<a href="Futurama">Futurama</a>". Even though the role was made for Hartman, he still insisted on auditioning and according to Groening, he 'nailed it'. After Hartman's death, <a href="Billy%20West">Billy West</a> took over the role of Brannigan. Though executive producer <a href="David%20X.%20Cohen">David X. Cohen</a> credits West with using his own take on the character, West later said that he purposely tweaked Zapp's voice to better match Hartman's intended portrayal. Hartman was also planning to appear with Lovitz in the <a href="indie%20film">indie film</a> "The Day of Swine and Roses", scheduled to begin production in August 1998.

Laugh.com and Hartman's brother, John Hartmann, published the album "Flat TV" in 2002. The album is a selection of comedy sketches recorded by Hartman in the 1970s that had been kept in storage until their release. Hartmann commented: "I'm putting this out there because I'm dedicating my life to fulfilling his dreams. This [album] is my brother doing what he loved." In 2013, "Flat TV" was optioned by <a href="Michael%20%26quot%3BFfish%26quot%3B%20Hemschoot">Michael "Ffish" Hemschoot</a>'s animation company <a href="Worker%20Studio">Worker Studio</a> for an animated adaptation. The deal came about after <a href="Michael%20T.%20Scott">Michael T. Scott</a>, a partner in the company, posted a hand-written letter he had received from Hartman in 1997 on the internet, leading to a correspondence between Scott and Paul Hartmann.

In 2007, a campaign was started on <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> by Alex Stevens and endorsed by Hartman's brother, Paul Hartmann, to have Hartman inducted to <a href="Canada%27s%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Canada's Walk of Fame</a>. Amongst the numerous events to publicize the campaign, Ben Miner, of the <a href="Sirius%20XM%20Radio">Sirius XM Radio</a> channel <a href="Laugh%20Attack">Laugh Attack</a>, dedicated the month of April 2012 to Hartman. The campaign ended in success and Hartman was inducted to the Walk of Fame on September 22, 2012, with Paul accepting the award on his late brother's behalf. Hartman was also awarded the Cineplex Legends Award. In June 2013, it was announced that Hartman would receive a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>, which was unveiled on August 26, 2014. Additionally, a special prize at the <a href="Canadian%20Comedy%20Awards">Canadian Comedy Awards</a> was named for Hartman. Beginning with the 13th Canadian Comedy Awards in 2012, the Phil Hartman Award was awarded to "an individual who helps to better the Canadian comedy community." In 2015, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine ranked Hartman as one of the top-ten greatest "Saturday Night Live" cast members throughout the show's forty-year history, coming in seventh on their list of all one-hundred-and-forty-one members.

Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)

John Whiteside "Jack" Parsons (born Marvel Whiteside Parsons; October 2, 1914 – June 17, 1952) was an American <a href="aerospace%20engineering">rocket engineer</a> and <a href="Spacecraft%20propulsion">rocket propulsion</a> researcher, <a href="chemist">chemist</a>, and <a href="Thelema">Thelemite</a> <a href="occult">occult</a>ist. Associated with the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a> (Caltech), Parsons was one of the principal founders of both the <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL) and the <a href="Aerojet">Aerojet Engineering Corporation</a>. He invented the first <a href="rocket%20engine">rocket engine</a> to use a <a href="Castability">castable</a>, <a href="Composite%20material">composite</a> <a href="rocket%20propellant">rocket propellant</a>, and pioneered the advancement of both <a href="Liquid-fuel%20rocket">liquid-fuel</a> and <a href="Solid-fuel%20rocket">solid-fuel</a> rockets.

Born in Los Angeles, Parsons was raised by a wealthy family on <a href="Orange%20Grove%20Boulevard%20%28Pasadena%29">Orange Grove Avenue</a> in <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena</a>. Inspired by <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> literature, he developed an interest in rocketry in his childhood and in 1928 began <a href="Amateur%20rocketry">amateur rocket experiments</a> with school friend Ed Forman. He dropped out of <a href="Pasadena%20City%20College">Pasadena Junior College</a> and <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a> due to financial difficulties during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, and in 1934 he united with Forman and graduate student <a href="Frank%20Malina">Frank Malina</a> to form the Caltech-affiliated <a href="Guggenheim%20Aeronautical%20Laboratory">Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory</a> (GALCIT) Rocket Research Group, supported by GALCIT chairman <a href="Theodore%20von%20K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n">Theodore von Kármán</a>. In 1939 the GALCIT Group gained funding from the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> (NAS) to work on <a href="JATO">Jet-Assisted Take Off</a> (JATO) for the U.S. military. Following American entry into World War II, in 1942 they founded Aerojet to develop and sell their JATO technology; the GALCIT Group became JPL in 1943.

After a brief involvement with <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> in 1939, Parsons converted to <a href="Thelema">Thelema</a>, the English occultist <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>'s <a href="new%20religious%20movement">new religious movement</a>. In 1941, alongside his first wife Helen Northrup, Parsons joined the <a href="Agape%20Lodge">Agape Lodge</a>, the Californian branch of the Thelemite <a href="Ordo%20Templi%20Orientis">Ordo Templi Orientis</a> (O.T.O.). At Crowley's bidding, he replaced <a href="Wilfred%20Talbot%20Smith">Wilfred Talbot Smith</a> as its leader in 1942 and ran the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Avenue. Parsons was expelled from JPL and Aerojet in 1944 due to the Lodge's infamous reputation, along with his hazardous workplace conduct.

In 1945 Parsons separated from Helen after having an affair with her sister <a href="Sara%20Northrup%20Hollister">Sara</a>; when Sara left him for <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, he conducted the <a href="Babalon%20Working">Babalon Working</a>, a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess <a href="Babalon">Babalon</a> to Earth. He and Hubbard continued the procedure with <a href="Marjorie%20Cameron">Marjorie Cameron</a>, whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and went through various jobs while acting as a consultant for the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Israel%20Defense%20Forces">Israeli</a> rocket program. Amid the climate of <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>, he was accused of <a href="espionage">espionage</a> and left unable to work in rocketry. In 1952 Parsons died at the age of 37 in a home laboratory explosion that attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident, but many associates suspected suicide or murder.

Parsons' occult and <a href="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> writings were published posthumously, with <a href="Western%20esotericism">Western esoteric</a> and countercultural circles citing him as one of the most significant figures in propagating Thelema across North America. Although academic interest in his scientific career was negligible, historians came to recognize Parsons' contributions to rocket engineering. For these innovations, his advocacy of <a href="space%20exploration">space exploration</a> and <a href="human%20spaceflight">human spaceflight</a>, and his role in the founding of JPL and Aerojet, Parsons is regarded as among the most important figures in the history of the U.S. space program. He has been the subject of several biographies and fictionalized portrayals, including the television drama "<a href="Strange%20Angel">Strange Angel</a>".

Marvel Whiteside Parsons was born on October 2, 1914, at the <a href="Good%20Samaritan%20Hospital%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Good Samaritan Hospital</a> in Los Angeles. His parents, Ruth Virginia Whiteside ("c." 1893–1952) and Marvel H. Parsons ("c." 1894–1947), had moved to California from Massachusetts the previous year, purchasing a house on Scarf Street in downtown Los Angeles. Their son was his father's namesake, but was known in the household as Jack. The marriage broke down soon after Jack's birth, when Ruth discovered that his father had made numerous visits to a prostitute, and she filed for divorce in March 1915. Parsons' father returned to Massachusetts after being publicly exposed as an adulterer, with Ruth forbidding him from having any contact with Jack. Parsons' father later joined the armed forces, reaching the rank of major, and married a woman with whom he had a son named Charles, a half-brother Jack would only meet once. Although she retained her ex-husband's surname, Ruth started calling her son John; many friends throughout his life knew him as Jack. Ruth's parents Walter and Carrie Whiteside moved to California to be with Jack and their daughter, using their wealth to buy an up-market house on Orange Grove Avenue in <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena</a>—known locally as "Millionaire's Mile"—where they could live together. Jack was surrounded by domestic servants. Having few friends, he lived a solitary childhood and spent much time reading; he took a particular interest in works of mythology, <a href="Arthurian%20legend">Arthurian legend</a>, and the "<a href="One%20Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights">Arabian Nights</a>". Through the works of <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a> he became interested in <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> and a keen reader of <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a>s like "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", which led to his early interest in <a href="rocket">rocket</a>ry.

When he was twelve, Parsons began attending Washington Junior High School, where he performed poorly—something biographer <a href="George%20Pendle">George Pendle</a> attributed to undiagnosed <a href="dyslexia">dyslexia</a>—and was bullied for his upper-class status and perceived effeminacy. Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy from a poor working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry, with the well-read Parsons enthralling Forman with his literary prowess. In 1928 the pair—adopting the Latin motto "<a href="per%20aspera%20ad%20astra">per aspera ad astra</a>" ("through hardship to the stars")—began engaging in homemade <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a>-based rocket experiments in the nearby <a href="Arroyo%20Seco%20%28Los%20Angeles%20County%29">Arroyo Seco</a> canyon, as well as the Parsons family's back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as <a href="cherry%20bomb">cherry bomb</a>s into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a binding agent to increase the rocket fuel's stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as <a href="aluminium%20foil">aluminium foil</a> to make the gunpowder easier to cast. Parsons had also begun to investigate <a href="occultism">occultism</a>, and performed a ritual intended to invoke <a href="the%20Devil">the Devil</a> into his bedroom; he worried that the invocation was successful and was frightened into ceasing these activities. In 1929 he began attending <a href="John%20Muir%20High%20School">John Muir High School</a>, where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in <a href="fencing">fencing</a> and <a href="archery">archery</a>. After he received poor school results, Parsons' mother sent him away to study at a private boarding school in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>—the Brown Military Academy for Boys—but he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.

The Parsons family spent mid-1929 on a tour of Europe before returning to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack's grandfather Walter died. Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching. He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school's newspaper "El Universitano" and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a> (Caltech) honed his attentions on the study of chemistry. With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the <a href="Hercules%20Powder%20Company">Hercules Powder Company</a>, where he learned more about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion. He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel <a href="rocket%20engine">rocket engine</a>, and with Forman corresponded with pioneer rocket engineers including <a href="Robert%20H.%20Goddard">Robert H. Goddard</a>, <a href="Hermann%20Oberth">Hermann Oberth</a>, <a href="Konstantin%20Tsiolkovsky">Konstantin Tsiolkovsky</a>, <a href="Willy%20Ley">Willy Ley</a> and <a href="Wernher%20von%20Braun">Wernher von Braun</a>. Parsons and von Braun had hours of telephone conversations about rocketry in their respective countries as well as their own research.

Parsons graduated from University School in 1933, and moved with his mother and grandmother to a more modest house on St. John Avenue, where he continued to pursue his interests in literature and poetry. He enrolled in <a href="Pasadena%20Junior%20College">Pasadena Junior College</a> with the hope of earning an <a href="associate%20degree">associate degree</a> in physics and chemistry, but dropped out after only a term because of his financial situation and took up permanent employment at the Hercules Powder Company. His employers then sent him to work at their manufacturing plant in <a href="Hercules%2C%20California">Hercules, California</a> on <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>, where he earned a relatively high wage of $100 a month; he was plagued by headaches caused by exposure to <a href="nitroglycerin">nitroglycerin</a>. He saved money in the hope of continuing his academic studies and began a degree in chemistry at <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a>, but found the tuition fees unaffordable and returned to Pasadena.

In the hope of gaining access to the state-of-the-art resources of Caltech for their rocketry research, Parsons and Forman attended a lecture on the work of Austrian rocket engineer <a href="Eugen%20S%C3%A4nger">Eugen Sänger</a> and hypothetical above-<a href="Stratosphere">stratospheric</a> aircraft by the institute's <a href="William%20Bollay">William Bollay</a>—a PhD student specializing in <a href="rocket-powered%20aircraft">rocket-powered aircraft</a>—and approached him to express their interest in designing a liquid-fuel rocket motor. Bollay redirected them to another PhD student named <a href="Frank%20Malina">Frank Malina</a>, a mathematician and mechanical engineer composing a thesis on rocket propulsion who shared their interests and soon befriended the pair. Parsons, Forman, and Malina applied for funding from Caltech together; they did not mention that their ultimate objective was to develop rockets for space exploration, realizing that most of the scientific establishment then relegated such ideas to science fiction. While Caltech's <a href="Clark%20Blanchard%20Millikan">Clark Blanchard Millikan</a> immediately rebuffed them, Malina's doctoral advisor <a href="Theodore%20von%20K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n">Theodore von Kármán</a> saw more promise in their proposal and agreed to allow them to operate under the auspices of the university's <a href="Guggenheim%20Aeronautical%20Laboratory">Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory</a> (GALCIT). Naming themselves the GALCIT Rocket Research Group, they gained access to Caltech's specialist equipment, though the economics of the Great Depression left von Kármán unable to finance them.

The trio focused their distinct skills on collaborative rocket development; Parsons was the chemist, Forman the machinist, and Malina the technical theoretician. Malina wrote in 1968 that the self-educated Parsons "lacked the discipline of a formal higher education, [but] had an uninhibited and fruitful imagination." The informally trained Parsons and Forman who, as described by <a href="Geoffrey%20A.%20Landis">Geoffrey A. Landis</a>, "were eager to try whatever idea happened to spring to mind", contrasted with the approach of Malina, who insisted on the need for scientific discipline as informed by von Kármán. Landis writes that their creativity "kept Malina focused toward building actual rocket engines, not just solving equations on paper". Sharing <a href="socialism">socialist</a> values, they operated on an <a href="egalitarianism">egalitarian</a> basis; Malina taught the others about scientific procedure and they taught him about the practical elements of rocketry. They often socialized, smoking <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a> and drinking, while Malina and Parsons set about writing a semiautobiographical science fiction screenplay they planned to pitch to Hollywood with strong <a href="anti-capitalism">anti-capitalist</a> and <a href="pacifism">pacifist</a> themes.

Parsons met Helen Northrup at a local church dance and proposed marriage in July 1934. She accepted and they were married in April 1935 at the Little Church of the Flowers in <a href="Forest%20Lawn%20Memorial%20Park%20%28Glendale%29">Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale</a>, before undertaking a brief honeymoon in San Diego. They moved into a house on South Terrace Drive, Pasadena, while Parsons gained employment for the explosives manufacturer Halifax Powder Company at their facility in <a href="Saugus%2C%20California">Saugus</a>. Much to Helen's dismay, Parsons spent most of his wages funding the GALCIT Rocket Research Group. For extra money he manufactured nitroglycerin in their home, constructing a home laboratory on their front porch. At one point he pawned Helen's engagement ring, and he often asked her family for loans.

Malina recounted that "Parsons and Forman were not too pleased with an austere program that did not include at least the launching of model rockets", but the Group reached the consensus of developing a working static rocket motor before embarking on more complex research. They contacted <a href="Liquid-propellant%20rocket">liquid-fuel rocket</a> pioneer Robert H. Goddard and he invited Malina to his facility in <a href="Roswell%2C%20New%20Mexico">Roswell, New Mexico</a>, but he was not interested in cooperating—reticent about sharing his research and having been subjected to widespread derision for his work in rocketry. They were instead joined by Caltech graduate students <a href="Apollo%20M.%20O.%20Smith">Apollo M. O. "Amo" Smith</a>, <a href="Carlos%20C.%20Wood">Carlos C. Wood</a>, <a href="Mark%20Muir%20Mills">Mark Muir Mills</a>, <a href="Fred%20S.%20Miller">Fred S. Miller</a>, <a href="William%20C.%20Rockefeller">William C. Rockefeller</a>, and <a href="Rudolph%20Schott">Rudolph Schott</a>; Schott was relied upon for the use of his pickup truck to transport equipment. Their first liquid-fuel motor test took place near the <a href="Devil%27s%20Gate%20Dam">Devil's Gate Dam</a> in the Arroyo Seco on Halloween 1936. Parsons' biographer John Carter described the layout of the contraption as showing

Three attempts to fire the rocket failed; on the fourth the oxygen line was accidentally ignited and perilously billowed fire at the Group, but they viewed this experience as formative. They continued their experiments throughout the last quarter of 1936; after the final test was successfully completed in January 1937 von Kármán agreed that they could perform their future experiments at an exclusive rocket testing facility on campus.
In April 1937 Caltech mathematician <a href="Qian%20Xuesen">Qian Xuesen</a> (a Chinese citizen) joined the Group. Several months later Weld Arnold, a Caltech laboratory assistant who worked as the Group's official photographer, also joined. The main reason for Arnold's appointment to this position was his provision of a donation to the Group on behalf of an anonymous benefactor. They became well known on campus, earning the moniker of the "Suicide Squad" for the dangerous nature of some of their experiments and attracting attention from the local press. Parsons himself gained further media publicity when he appeared as an expert explosives witness in the trial of Captain <a href="Earl%20Kynette">Earl Kynette</a>, the head of police intelligence in Los Angeles who was accused of conspiring to set a <a href="car%20bomb">car bomb</a> in the attempted murder of private investigator Harry Raymond, a former LAPD detective who was fired after whistleblowing against police corruption. When Kynette was convicted largely on Parsons' testimony, which included his forensic reconstruction of the car bomb and its explosion, his identity as an expert scientist in the public eye was established despite his lack of a university education. While working at Caltech, Parsons was admitted to evening courses in chemistry at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> (USC), but distracted by his GALCIT workload he attended sporadically and received unexceptional grades.

By early 1938 the Group had made their static rocket motor, which originally burned for three seconds, run for over a minute. In May that year, Parsons was invited by <a href="Forrest%20J%20Ackerman">Forrest J Ackerman</a> to lecture on his rocketry work at Chapter Number 4 of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Science%20Fantasy%20Society">Los Angeles Science Fiction League</a> (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>. Another scientist to become involved in the GALCIT project was <a href="Sidney%20Weinbaum">Sidney Weinbaum</a>, a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive <a href="communism">communist</a> discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the "<a href="People%27s%20Daily%20World">People's Daily World</a>" and joined the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU), he refused to join the <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">American Communist Party</a>, causing a break in his and Weinbaum's friendship. This, coupled with the need to focus on paid employment, led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding members by late 1938.

In January 1939 John and Frances Baxter, a brother and sister who had befriended Jack and Helen Parsons, took Jack to the Church of Thelema on Winona Boulevard, Hollywood, where he witnessed the performance of <a href="Liber%20XV%2C%20The%20Gnostic%20Mass">The Gnostic Mass</a>. Celebrants of the church had included Hollywood actor <a href="John%20Carradine">John Carradine</a> and gay rights activist <a href="Harry%20Hay">Harry Hay</a>. Parsons was intrigued, having already heard of Thelema's founder and <a href="Ordo%20Templi%20Orientis%23Structure">Outer Head</a> of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>, after reading a copy of Crowley's text "<a href="Konx%20om%20Pax">Konx om Pax</a>" (1907).

Parsons was introduced to leading members <a href="Regina%20Kahl">Regina Kahl</a>, <a href="Jane%20Wolfe">Jane Wolfe</a>, and <a href="Wilfred%20Talbot%20Smith">Wilfred Talbot Smith</a> at the mass. Feeling both "repulsion and attraction" for Smith, Parsons continued to sporadically attend the Church's events for a year. He continued to read Crowley's works, which increasingly interested him, and encouraged Helen to read them. Parsons came to believe in the reality of <a href="Magick%20%28Thelema%29">Thelemic magick</a> as a force that could be explained through <a href="quantum%20physics">quantum physics</a>. He tried to interest his friends and acquaintances in Thelema, taking science fiction writers <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a> and <a href="Cleve%20Cartmill">Cleve Cartmill</a> to a performance of The Gnostic Mass. Although they were unimpressed, Parsons was more successful with <a href="Grady%20Louis%20McMurtry">Grady Louis McMurtry</a>, a young Caltech student he had befriended, as well as McMurtry's fiancée Claire Palmer, and Helen's sister <a href="Sara%20Northrup%20Hollister">Sara "Betty" Northrup</a>.
Jack and Helen were initiated into the Agape Lodge, the renamed Church of Thelema, in February 1941. Parsons adopted the Thelemic motto of "Thelema Obtenteum Proedero Amoris Nuptiae", a Latin mistranslation of "The establishment of Thelema through the rituals of love". The initials of this motto spelled out T.O.P.A.N., also serving as the declaration "To Pan". Commenting on Parsons' errors of translation, in jest Crowley said that "the motto which you mention is couched in a language beyond my powers of understanding". Parsons also adopted the Thelemic title "Frater T.O.P.A.N"—with "T.O.P.A.N" represented in <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalistic</a> numerology as "210"the name with which he frequently signed letters to occult associates—while Helen became known as "Soror Grimaud". Smith wrote to Crowley saying that Parsons was "a really excellent man ... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself ... JP is going to be very valuable". Wolfe wrote to German O.T.O. representative <a href="Karl%20Germer">Karl Germer</a> that Parsons was "an A1 man ... Crowleyesque in attainment as a matter of fact", and mooted Parsons as a potential successor to Crowley as Outer Head of the Order. Crowley concurred with such assessments, informing Smith that Parsons "is the most valued member of the whole Order, with no exception!"

At von Kármán's suggestion, <a href="Frank%20Malina">Frank Malina</a> approached the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> (NAS) Committee on Army Air Corps Research to request funding for research into what they referred to as "<a href="jet%20propulsion">jet propulsion</a>", a term chosen to avoid the stigma attached to rocketry. The military were interested in jet propulsion as a means of getting aircraft quickly airborne where there was insufficient room for a full-length runway, and gave the Rocket Research Group $1,000 to put together a proposal on the feasibility of <a href="JATO">Jet-Assisted Take Off</a> (JATO) by June 1939, making Parsons et al. the first U.S. government-sanctioned rocket research group. Since their formation in 1934, they had also performed experiments involving model, <a href="Black%20powder%20rocket%20motor">black powder motor</a>-propelled <a href="multistage%20rocket">multistage rocket</a>s. In a research paper submitted to the <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Aeronautics%20and%20Astronautics">American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a> (AIAA), Parsons reported these rockets reaching velocities of 4,875 miles per hour, thereby demonstrating the potential of solid fuels to be more effective than the liquid types primarily preferred by researchers such as Goddard. In light of this progress, Caltech and the GALCIT Group received an additional $10,000 rocketry research grant from the AIAA.

Although a quarter of their funding went to repairing damage to Caltech buildings caused by their experiments, in June 1940 they submitted a report to the NAS in which they showed the feasibility of the project for the development of JATO and requested $100,000 to continue; they received $22,000. Now known as GALCIT Project Number 1, they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists who grew increasingly irritated by their accidents and noise pollution, and were forced to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, at a site with unventilated, corrugated iron sheds that served as both research facilities and administrative offices. It was here that JPL would be founded. Parsons and Forman's rocket experiments were the cover story of the August 1940 edition of "<a href="Popular%20Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a>", in which the pair discussed the prospect of rockets being able to ascend above Earth's atmosphere and orbit around it for research purposes, as well as reaching the Moon.

For the JATO project, they were joined by Caltech mathematician <a href="Martin%20Summerfield">Martin Summerfield</a> and 18 workers supplied by the <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a>. Former colleagues like Qian were prevented from returning to the project by the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), who ensured the secrecy of the operation and restricted the involvement of foreign nationals and political extremists. The FBI was satisfied that Parsons was not a Marxist but were concerned when Thelemite friend Paul Seckler used Parsons' gun in a drunken car hijacking, for which Seckler was imprisoned in <a href="San%20Quentin%20State%20Prison">San Quentin State Prison</a> for two years. Englishman George Emerson replaced Arnold as the Group's official photographer.

The Group's aim was to find a replacement for black-powder rocket motors—units consisting of charcoal, <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> and <a href="potassium%20nitrate">potassium nitrate</a> with a <a href="Binder%20%28material%29">binding agent</a>. The mixture was unstable and there were frequent explosions damaging military aircraft. The solid JATO fuel invented by Parsons consisted of <a href="amide">amide</a>, <a href="corn%20starch">corn starch</a>, and <a href="ammonium%20nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> bound together in the JATO unit with glue and blotting paper. It was codenamed GALCIT-27, implying the previous invention of 26 new fuels. The first JATO tests using an <a href="ERCO%20Ercoupe">ERCO Ercoupe</a> plane took place in late July 1941; though they aided propulsion, the units frequently exploded and damaged the aircraft. Parsons theorized that this was because the ammonium nitrate became dangerously combustible following overnight storage, during which temperature and consistency changes had resulted in a chemical imbalance. Parsons and Malina accordingly devised a method in which they would fill the JATOs with the fuel in the early mornings shortly before the tests, enduring sleep deprivation to do so. On August 21, 1941, Navy Captain Homer J. Boushey, Jr.—watched by Clark Millikan and <a href="William%20F.%20Durand">William F. Durand</a>—piloted the JATO-equipped Ercoupe at <a href="March%20Air%20Reserve%20Base">March Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Moreno%20Valley">Moreno Valley</a>, California. It proved a success and reduced takeoff distance by 30%, but one of the JATOs partially exploded. Over the following weeks 62 further tests took place, and the NAS increased their grant to $125,000. During a series of static experiments, an exploding JATO did significant damage to the rear fuselage of an Ercoupe; one observer optimistically noted that "at least it wasn't a big hole", but necessary repairs delayed their efforts.

The military ordered a flight test using liquid rather than solid fuel in early 1942. Upon the United States' entry into the Second World War in December 1941, the Group realized they could be drafted directly into military service if they failed to provide viable JATO technology for the military. Informed by their left-wing politics, aiding the war effort against <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a> was as much of a moral vocation to Parsons, Forman and Malina as it was a practical one. Parsons, Summerfield and the GALCIT workers focused on the task and found success with a combination of <a href="gasoline">gasoline</a> with <a href="red%20fuming%20nitric%20acid">red fuming nitric acid</a> as its <a href="Oxidizing%20agent">oxidizer</a>; the latter, suggested by Parsons, was an effective substitute for <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a>. The testing of this fuel resulted in another calamity, when the testing rocket motor exploded; the fire, containing iron shed fragments and shrapnel, inexplicably left the experimenters unscathed. Malina solved the problem by replacing the gasoline with <a href="aniline">aniline</a>, resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped <a href="A-20A">A-20A</a> plane at the Muroc Auxiliary Air Field in the <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a>. It provided five times more thrust than GALCIT-27, and again reduced takeoff distance by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents that "We now have something that really works and we should be able to help give the Fascists hell!"

The Group then agreed to produce and sell 60 JATO engines to the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a>. To do so they formed the Aerojet Engineering Corporation in March 1942, in which Parsons, Forman, Malina, von Kármán, and Summerfield each invested $250, opening their offices on <a href="Colorado%20Boulevard">Colorado Boulevard</a> and bringing in Amo Smith as their engineer. <a href="Andrew%20G.%20Haley">Andrew G. Haley</a> was recruited by von Kármán as their lawyer and treasurer. Although Aerojet was a for-profit operation that provided technology for military means, the founders' mentality was rooted in the ideal of using rockets for peaceful space exploration. As Haley recounted von Kármán requesting: "we will make the rockets—you must make the corporation and obtain the money. Later on you will have to see that we all behave well in outer space."

Despite these successes, Parsons, the <a href="Project%20engineering">project engineer</a> of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated to address the malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust and did not have the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with <a href="guanidine%20nitrate">guanidine nitrate</a>. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a> as an appropriate binding agent with <a href="potassium%20perchlorate">potassium perchlorate</a> as oxidizer.

Malina recounted that Parsons was inspired to use asphalt by the ancient incendiary weapon <a href="Greek%20fire">Greek fire</a>; in a 1982 talk for the <a href="International%20Association%20of%20Astronomical%20Artists">International Association of Astronomical Artists</a> Captain Boushey stated that Parsons experienced an epiphany after watching workers using molten asphalt to fix tiles onto a roof. Known as GALCIT-53, this fuel proved to be significantly more stable than the Group's earlier concoctions, fulfilling Parsons' aim of creating a restricted-burn rocket fuel inside a castable container, and providing a thrust 427% more powerful than that of GALCIT-27. This set a precedent which according to his biographer John Carter "changed the future of rocket technology": the <a href="thermoplastic">thermoplastic</a> asphalt <a href="casting">casting</a> was durable in all climates, allowing for mass production and indefinite storage and transforming solid-fuel agents into a safe and viable form of rocket propulsion. <a href="Plasticizer">Plasticized</a> variants of Parsons' solid-fuel design invented by JPL's <a href="Charles%20Bartley">Charles Bartley</a> were later used by <a href="NASA">NASA</a> in <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Solid%20Rocket%20Booster">Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster</a>s and by the <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command">Strategic Air Command</a> in <a href="UGM-27%20Polaris">Polaris</a>, <a href="UGM-73%20Poseidon">Poseidon</a> and <a href="LGM-30%20Minuteman">Minuteman</a> intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Aerojet's first two contracts were from the U.S. Navy; the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Aeronautics">Bureau of Aeronautics</a> requested a solid-fuel JATO and <a href="Wilbur%20Wright%20Field">Wilbur Wright Field</a> requested a liquid-fuel unit. The Air Corps had requested two thousand JATOs from Aerojet by late 1943, committing $256,000 toward Parsons' solid-fuel type. Despite this drastically increased turnover, the company continued to operate informally and remained intertwined with the GALCIT project. Caltech astronomer <a href="Fritz%20Zwicky">Fritz Zwicky</a> was brought in as head of the company's research department. Haley replaced von Kármán as Aerojet chairman and imposed payroll cuts instead of reducing JATO output; the alternative was to cut staff numbers while maintaining more generous salaries, but Haley's priority was Aerojet's contribution to the war effort. Company heads including Parsons were exempted from this austerity, drawing the ire of many personnel.

Parsons' newfound credentials and financial security gave him the opportunity to travel more widely throughout the U.S. as an ambassador for Aerojet, meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York he met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America and in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> he met Poet Laureate <a href="Joseph%20Auslander">Joseph Auslander</a>, donating some of Crowley's poetry books to the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>. He also became a regular at the <a href="Ma%C3%B1ana%20Literary%20Society">Mañana Literary Society</a>, which met in <a href="Laurel%20Canyon">Laurel Canyon</a> at the home of Parsons' friend <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> and included science fiction writers including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a>. Among Parsons' favorite works of fiction was Williamson's "<a href="Darker%20Than%20You%20Think">Darker Than You Think</a>", a novelette published in the fantasy magazine "<a href="Unknown%20%28magazine%29">Unknown</a>" in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his murder mystery "<a href="Rocket%20to%20the%20Morgue">Rocket to the Morgue</a>" (1942).

Helen went away for a period in June 1941, during which Parsons, encouraged to do so by the sexually permissive attitude of the O.T.O., began a sexual relationship with her 17-year-old sister, Sara. Upon Helen's return, Sara asserted that she was Parsons' new wife, and Parsons himself admitted that he found Sara more sexually attractive than Helen. Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort in Smith and began a relationship with him that lasted for the rest of his life; the four remained friends. The two couples, along with a number of other Thelemites (some of whom with their children), moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, an <a href="American%20Craftsman">American Craftsman-style</a> mansion. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month and lived communally in what replaced Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, maintaining an allotment and slaughtering their own livestock for meat as well as blood rituals. Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the <a href="Stele%20of%20Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu">Stele of Revealing</a>, a statue of <a href="Pan%20%28god%29">Pan</a>, and his collection of swords and daggers. He converted the garage and laundry room into a chemical laboratory and often held science fiction discussion meetings in the kitchen, and entertained the children with hunts for fairies in the 25-acre garden.

Although there were arguments among the commune members, Parsons remained dedicated to Thelema. He gave almost all of his salary to the O.T.O. while actively seeking out new membersincluding Formanand financially supported Crowley in London through Germer. Parsons' enthusiasm for the Lodge quickly began to impact on his professional life. He frequently appeared at Aerojet hungover and sleep-deprived from late nights of Lodge activities, and invited many of his colleagues to them, drawing the ire of staff who previously tolerated Parsons' occultism as harmless eccentricity; known to von Kármán as a "delightful screwball", he was frequently observed reciting Crowley's poem "Hymn to Pan" in an ecstatic manner compared to the preaching of <a href="Billy%20Graham">Billy Graham</a> during rocket testsand on request at parties to their great amusement. They disapproved of his hesitancy to separate his vocations; Parsons became more rigorously engaged in Aerojet's day-to-day business in an effort to resolve this weariness, but the Agape Lodge soon came under investigation by both the <a href="Pasadena%20Police%20Department%20%28California%29">Pasadena Police Department</a> and the FBI. Both had received allegations of a "<a href="black%20magic">black magic</a> cult" involved in sexual orgies; one complainant was a 16-year-old boy who said that he was raped by lodge members, while neighbors reported a ritual involving a naked pregnant woman jumping through fire. After Parsons explained that the Lodge was simply "an organization dedicated to religious and philosophical speculation", neither agency found evidence of illegal activity and came to the conclusion that the Lodge constituted no threat to national security. Having been a long-term heavy user of alcohol and marijuana, Parsons now habitually used <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>, <a href="amphetamines">amphetamines</a>, <a href="peyote">peyote</a>, <a href="mescaline">mescaline</a>, and <a href="opiate">opiate</a>s as well. He continued to have sexual relations with multiple women, including McMurtry's fiancée Claire. When Parsons paid for her to have an <a href="abortion">abortion</a>, McMurtry was angered and their friendship broke down.
Crowley and Germer wanted to see Smith removed as head of the Agape Lodge, believing that he had become a bad influence on its members. Parsons and Helen wrote to them to defend their mentor but Germer ordered him to stand down; Parsons was appointed as temporary head of the Lodge. Some veteran Lodge members disliked Parsons' influence, concerned that it encouraged excessive sexual polyandry that was religiously detrimental, but his charismatic orations at Lodge meetings assured his popularity among the majority of followers. Parsons soon created the Thelemite journal "Oriflamme", in which he published his own poetry, but Crowley was unimpressedparticularly due to Parsons' descriptions of drug useand the project was soon shelved. Helen gave birth to Smith's son in April; the child was named Kwen Lanval Parsons. Smith and Helen left with Kwen for a two-room cabin in Rainbow Valley in May. Concurrently in England, Crowley undertook an <a href="astrology">astrological</a> analysis of Smith's birth chart and came to the conclusion that Smith was the incarnation of a god, greatly altering his estimation of him. Smith remained skeptical as Crowley's analysis was seemingly deliberately devised in Parsons' favor, encouraging Smith to step down from his role in the Agape Lodge and instructing him to take a meditative retreat. Refusing to take orders from Germer any more, Smith resigned from the O.T.O. Parsons—who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict and was weary of Crowley's "appalling egotism, bad taste, bad judgement, and pedanticism"—ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head, but withdrew his resignation after receiving a pacifying letter from Crowley.
By mid-1943 Aerojet was operating on a budget of $650,000. The same year Parsons and von Kármán traveled to <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a> on the invitation of Secretary of the Navy <a href="Frank%20Knox">Frank Knox</a> to consult on a new JATO contract for the U.S. Navy. Though JATOs were being mass-produced for military applications, JATO-propelled aircraft could not "keep up" with larger, <a href="bomber">bomber</a> planes taking off from long aircraft carrier runways—which made Aerojet's industry at risk of becoming defunct. Parsons demonstrated the efficacy of the newer JATOs to solve this issue by equipping a <a href="Grumman">Grumman</a> plane with solid-fuel units; its assisted takeoff from the <a href="USS%20Charger%20%28CVE-30%29">USS "Charger"</a> was successful, but produced smoke containing a noxious, yellow-colored residue. The Navy guaranteed Parsons a contract on the condition that this residue was removed; this led to the invention of "Aeroplex", a technology for smokeless <a href="Contrail">vapor trails</a> developed at Aerojet by Parsons.

As the U.S. became aware that Nazi Germany had developed the <a href="V-2%20rocket">V-2 rocket</a>, the military—following recommendations from von Kármán based upon research using British intelligence—placed a renewed impetus on its own rocket research, reinstating Qian to the GALCIT project. They gave the Group a $3 million grant to develop rocket-based weapons, and the Group was expanded and renamed the <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL). By this point the Navy were ordering 20,000 JATOs a month from Aerojet, and in December 1944 Haley negotiated for the company to sell 51% of its stock to the <a href="General%20Tire">General Tire and Rubber Company</a> to cope with the increased demand. Aerojet's Caltech-linked employees—including Zwicky, Malina and Summerfield—would only agree to the sale on the condition that Parsons and Forman were removed from the company, viewing their occult activities as disreputable. JPL historian <a href="Erik%20M.%20Conway">Erik M. Conway</a> also attributes Parsons' expulsion to more practical concerns: he "still wanted to work in the same way as he'd done in his backyard, instinctive and without regard for safety". Parsons and Forman were unfazed, informing Haley of their prediction that the rocket industry would become obsolete in the postwar age and seeing more financial incentive in starting a chain of laundromats. Haley persuaded them to sell their stock, resulting in Parsons leaving the company with $11,000. With this money he bought the lease to 1003, which had come to be known as "the Parsonage" after him.

Now disassociated from JPL and Aerojet, Parsons and Forman founded the Ad Astra Engineering Company, under which Parsons founded the chemical manufacturing Vulcan Powder Company. Ad Astra was subject to an FBI investigation under suspicion of espionage when security agents from the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> discovered that Parsons and Forman had procured a chemical used in a top secret project for a material known only as <a href="Natural%20uranium">"x-metal"</a>, but they were later acquitted of any wrongdoing. Parsons continued to financially support Smith and Helen, although he asked for a divorce from her and ignored Crowley's commands by welcoming Smith back to the Parsonage when his retreat was finished. Parsons continued to hold O.T.O. activities at the Parsonage but began renting rooms at the house to non-Thelemites, including journalist <a href="Nieson%20Himmel">Nieson Himmel</a>, Manhattan Project physicist <a href="Robert%20Cornog">Robert Cornog</a>, and science fiction artist <a href="Louis%20Goldstone">Louis Goldstone</a>. Parsons attracted controversy in Pasadena for his preferred clientele. Parsonage resident Alva Rogers recalled in a 1962 article for an occultist <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>: "In the ads placed in the local paper Jack specified that only bohemians, artists, musicians, atheists, anarchists, or any other exotic types need to apply for rooms—any mundane soul would be unceremoniously rejected".

Science fiction writer and U.S. Navy officer <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> soon moved into the Parsonage; he and Parsons became close friends. Parsons wrote to Crowley that although Hubbard had "no formal training in Magick he has an extraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deduce he is direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his <a href="Guardian%20Angel">Guardian Angel</a>. ... He is the most Thelemic person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our own principles."

Parsons and Sara were in an <a href="open%20relationship">open relationship</a> encouraged by the O.T.O.'s polyandrous sexual ethics, and she became enamored with Hubbard; Parsons, despite attempting to repress his passions, became intensely jealous. Motivated to find a new partner through occult means, Parsons began to devote his energies to conducting black magic, causing concern among fellow O.T.O. members who believed that it was invoking troublesome spirits into the Parsonage; Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley that "our own Jack is enamored with <a href="Witchcraft">Witchcraft</a>, the <a href="Hounfour">houmfort</a>, voodoo. From the start he always wanted to evoke something—no matter what, I am inclined to think, as long as he got a result." He told the residents that he was imbuing statues in the house with a magical energy in order to sell them to fellow occultists. Parsons reported paranormal events in the house resulting from the rituals; including <a href="poltergeist">poltergeist</a> activity, sightings of <a href="Orb%20%28optics%29%23Paranormal%20interpretation">orbs</a> and ghostly apparitions, <a href="Alchemy">alchemical</a> (<a href="sylph">sylph</a>ic) effect on the weather, and disembodied voices. Pendle suggested that Parsons was particularly susceptible to these interpretations and attributed the voices to a prank by Hubbard and Sara. One ritual allegedly brought screaming <a href="banshee">banshee</a>s to the windows of the Parsonage, an incident that disturbed Forman for the rest of his life. In December 1945 Parsons began a series of rituals based on <a href="Enochian%20magic">Enochian magic</a> during which he <a href="masturbation">masturbated</a> onto magical tablets, accompanied by <a href="Sergei%20Prokofiev">Sergei Prokofiev</a>'s <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Prokofiev%29">Second Violin Concerto</a>. Describing this magical operation as the <a href="Babalon%20Working">Babalon Working</a>, he hoped to bring about the incarnation of Thelemite goddess <a href="Babalon">Babalon</a> onto Earth. He allowed Hubbard to take part as his "scribe", believing that he was particularly sensitive to detecting magical phenomena. As described by <a href="Richard%20Metzger">Richard Metzger</a>, "Parsons jerked off in the name of spiritual advancement" while Hubbard "scanned the astral plane for signs and visions."

Their final ritual took place in the Mojave Desert in late February 1946, during which Parsons abruptly decided that his undertaking was complete. On returning to the Parsonage he discovered that <a href="Marjorie%20Cameron">Marjorie Cameron</a>—an unemployed illustrator and former Navy <a href="WAVES">WAVE</a>—had come to visit. Believing her to be the "<a href="elemental">elemental</a>" woman and manifestation of Babalon that he had invoked, in early March Parsons began performing <a href="sex%20magic">sex magic</a> rituals with Cameron, who acted as his "<a href="Babalon%23Office%20of%20the%20Scarlet%20Woman">Scarlet Woman</a>", while Hubbard continued to participate as the <a href="amanuensis">amanuensis</a>. Unlike the rest of the household, Cameron knew nothing at first of Parsons' magical intentions: "I didn't know anything about the O.T.O., I didn't know that they had invoked me, I didn't know anything, but the whole house knew it. Everybody was watching to see what was going on." Despite this ignorance and her skepticism about Parsons' magic, Cameron reported her sighting of a <a href="Unidentified%20flying%20object">UFO</a> to Parsons, who secretly recorded the sighting as a materialization of Babalon.

Inspired by Crowley's novel "<a href="Moonchild%20%28novel%29">Moonchild</a>" (1917), Parsons and Hubbard aimed to magically fertilize a "magical child" through <a href="immaculate%20conception">immaculate conception</a>, which when born to a woman somewhere on Earth nine months following the working's completion would become the Thelemic messiah embodying Babalon. To quote Metzger, the purpose of the Babalon Working was "a daring attempt to shatter the boundaries of space and time" facilitating, according to Parsons, the emergence of Thelema's <a href="Aeon%20%28Thelema%29">Æon of Horus</a>. When Cameron departed for a trip to New York, Parsons retreated to the desert, where he believed that a <a href="preternatural">preternatural</a> entity <a href="Automatic%20writing">psychographically</a> provided him with "Liber 49", which represented a fourth part of Crowley's "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20the%20Law">The Book of the Law</a>", the primary sacred text of Thelema, as well as part of a new sacred text he called the "Book of Babalon". Crowley was bewildered and concerned by the endeavor, complaining to Germer of being "fairly frantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these louts!" Believing the Babalon Working was accomplished, Parsons sold the Parsonage to developers for $25,000 under the condition that he and Cameron could continue to live in the coach house, and he appointed Roy Leffingwell to head the Agape Lodge, which would now have to meet elsewhere for its rituals.

Parsons co-founded a company called Allied Enterprises with Hubbard and Sara, into which Parsons invested his life savings of $20,970. Hubbard suggested that with this money they travel to <a href="Miami">Miami</a> to purchase three yachts, which they would then sail through the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> to the West Coast, where they could sell them on for a profit. Parsons agreed, but many of his friends thought it was a bad idea. Hubbard had secretly requested permission from the U.S. Navy to sail to China and South and Central America on a mission to "collect writing material"; his real plans were for a world cruise. Left "flat broke" by this defrauding, Parsons was incensed when he discovered that Hubbard and Sara had left for Miami with $10,000 of the money; he suspected a scam but was placated by a telephone call from Hubbard and agreed to remain business partners. When Crowley, in a telegram to Germer, dismissed Parsons as a "weak fool" and victim to Hubbard and Sara's obvious confidence trick, Parsons changed his mind, flew to Miami and placed a temporary injunction and restraining order on them. Upon tracking them down to a harbor in <a href="MacArthur%20Causeway">County Causeway</a>, Parsons discovered that the couple had purchased three yachts as planned; they tried to flee aboard one but hit a squall and were forced to return to port. Parsons was convinced that he had brought them to shore through a <a href="lesser%20banishing%20ritual%20of%20the%20pentagram">lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram</a> containing an astrological, <a href="Geomantic%20figures">geomantic</a> invocation of <a href="Geomantic%20figures%23The%20geomantic%20figures">Bartzabel</a>a vengeful spirit of <a href="Mars%20%28mythology%29">Mars</a>. Allied Enterprises was dissolved and in a court settlement Hubbard was required to promise to reimburse Parsons. Parsons was discouraged from taking further action by Sara, who threatened to report him for <a href="statutory%20rape">statutory rape</a> since their sexual relationship took place when she was under California's <a href="age%20of%20consent">age of consent</a> of 18. Parsons was ultimately compensated with only $2,900. Hubbard, already married to <a href="Margaret%20Grubb">Margaret Grubb</a>, <a href="Bigamy">bigamously</a> married Sara and went on to found <a href="Dianetics">Dianetics</a> and <a href="Scientology">Scientology</a>.

"<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" published an article about Hubbard's involvement with the O.T.O. and Parsons' occult activities in December 1969. In response, the <a href="Church%20of%20Scientology">Church of Scientology</a> released an unsubstantiated press statement which said that Hubbard had been sent as an undercover agent by the U.S. Navy to intercept and destroy Parsons' "black magic cult", and save Sara from its influence. The Church also stated that Robert A. Heinlein was the clandestine Navy operative who "sent in" Hubbard to undertake this operation. Returning to California, Parsons completed the sale of the Parsonage, which was then demolished, and resigned from the O.T.O. He wrote in his letter to Crowley that he did not believe that "as an autocratic organization, [the O.T.O.] constitutes a true and proper medium for the expression and attainment" of Thelema.

Parsons was employed by <a href="North%20American%20Aviation">North American Aviation</a> at <a href="Inglewood%2C%20California">Inglewood</a>, where he worked on the <a href="SM-64%20Navaho">Navaho Missile Program</a>. He and Cameron moved into a house in <a href="Manhattan%20Beach%2C%20California">Manhattan Beach</a>, where he instructed her in occultism and esotericism. When Cameron developed <a href="catalepsy">catalepsy</a>, Parsons referred her to <a href="Sylvan%20Muldoon">Sylvan Muldoon</a>'s books on <a href="astral%20projection">astral projection</a>, suggesting that she could manipulate her seizures to accomplish it. They were married on October 19, 1946, four days after his divorce from Helen was finalized, with Forman as their witness. Parsons continued to be seen as a specialist in rocketry; he acted as an expert consultant in numerous industrial tribunals and police and <a href="Ordnance%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Army Ordnance</a> investigations regarding explosions. In May 1947, Parsons gave a talk at the <a href="Pacific%20Rocket%20Society">Pacific Rocket Society</a> in which he predicted that rockets would take humans to the Moon. Although he had become distant from the now largely defunct O.T.O. and had sold much of his Crowleyan library, he continued to correspond with Crowley until the latter's death in December 1947.

At the emergence of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, a <a href="Red%20Scare">Red Scare</a> developed in the U.S. as the Congressional <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> began investigating and obstructing the careers of people with perceived communist sympathies. Many of Parsons' former colleagues lost their security clearances and jobs as a result, and eventually the FBI stripped Parsons of his clearance because of his "subversive" character, including his involvement in and advocacy of "sexual perversion" in the O.T.O. He speculated in a June 1949 letter to Germer that his clearance was revoked in response to his public dissemination of Crowley's "<a href="Liber%20OZ">Liber OZ</a>", a 1941 tract summarizing the individualist moral principles of Thelema. Declassified FBI documents later revealed that the FBI's primary concern was Parsons' former connections to Marxists at Caltech and his membership of the also "subversive" ACLU. When they interviewed Parsons he denied communist sympathies but informed them of Sidney Weinbaum's "extreme communist views" and <a href="Frank%20Malina">Frank Malina</a>'s involvement in Weinbaum's communist cell at Caltech, which resulted in Weinbaum's arrest for perjury since he had lied under oath by denying any involvement in communist groups. Malina's security clearance was withdrawn as well. In reaction to this hostile treatment, Parsons sought work in the rocket industry abroad. He sought advice to do so in correspondence with von Kármán; whose advice he followed by enrolling in an evening course in advanced mathematics at USC to bolster his employability in the field—but again he neglected attendance and failed the course. Parsons again resorted to bootlegging nitroglycerin for money, and managed to earn a wage as a car mechanic, a manual laborer at a gas station, and a hospital orderly; for two years he was also a faculty member at the USC Department of Pharmacology. Relations between Parsons and Cameron became strained; they agreed to a temporary separation and she moved to Mexico to join an artists' commune in <a href="San%20Miguel%20de%20Allende">San Miguel de Allende</a>.

Unable to pursue his scientific career, without his wife and devoid of friendship, Parsons decided to return to occultism and embarked on sexually based magical operations with prostitutes. He was intent, informally following the ritualistic practice of Thelemite organization the <a href="A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4">A∴A∴</a>, on performing "the Crossing of the <a href="Abyss%20%28Thelema%29">Abyss</a>", attaining union with the <a href="Universal%20mind">universal consciousness</a>, or "All" as understood in <a href="Thelemic%20mysticism">Thelemic mysticism</a>, and becoming the "<a href="A%E2%88%B4A%E2%88%B4%23The%20Order%20of%20the%20S%E2%88%B4S%E2%88%B4">Master of the Temple</a>". Following his apparent success in doing so, Parsons recounted having an <a href="out-of-body%20experience">out-of-body experience</a> invoked by Babalon, who astrally transported him to the biblical <a href="Chorazin">City of Chorazin</a>, an experience he referred to as a "Black Pilgrimage". Accompanying Parsons' "Oath of the Abyss" was his own "Oath of the AntiChrist", which was witnessed by Wilfred Talbot Smith. In this oath, Parsons professed to embody an entity named "Belarion Armillus Al Dajjal", the <a href="Antichrist">Antichrist</a> "who am come to fulfill the law of the Beast 666 [Aleister Crowley]". Viewing these oaths as the completion of the Babalon Working, Parsons wrote an <a href="Illeism">illeist</a> autobiography titled "Analysis by a Master of the Temple" and an occult text titled "The Book of AntiChrist". In the latter work, Parsons (writing as "Belarion") prophesied that within nine years Babalon would manifest on Earth and supersede the dominance of the <a href="Abrahamic%20religions">Abrahamic religions</a>.

During this period, Parsons also wrote an essay on his individualist philosophy and politics—which he described as standing for "<a href="liberalism">liberalism</a> and liberal principles"—titled "Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword", in which he condemned the authoritarianism, censorship, corruption, <a href="antisexualism">antisexualism</a> and racism he saw as prevalent in American society. None of these works were published in his lifetime. Through Heinlein, Parsons received a visit from writer <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>, with whom he discussed magic and science fiction, and disclosed that Hubbard had sent a letter offering him Sara back. De Camp later referred to Parsons as "An authentic mad genius if I ever met one", and based the character Courtney James on him in his time travel story "<a href="A%20Gun%20for%20Dinosaur">A Gun for Dinosaur</a>" (1956). Parsons was also visited by Jane Wolfe, who unsuccessfully appealed for him to rejoin the dilapidated O.T.O. He entered a brief relationship with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan; they moved to a house on <a href="Redondo%20Beach%2C%20California">Redondo Beach</a>, a building known by them as the "Concrete Castle". Cameron returned to Redondo Beach from San Miguel de Allende and violently argued with Parsons upon discovering his infidelity, before she again left for Mexico. Parsons responded by initiating divorce proceedings against her on the grounds of "extreme cruelty".
Parsons testified to a closed federal court that the moral philosophy of Thelema was both anti-fascist and anti-communist, emphasizing his belief in individualism. This along with references from his scientific colleagues resulted in his security clearance being reinstated by the <a href="Industrial%20Employment%20Review%20Board">Industrial Employment Review Board</a>, which ruled that there was insufficient evidence that he had ever had communist sympathies. This allowed Parsons to obtain a contract in designing and constructing a chemical plant for the <a href="Hughes%20Aircraft%20Company">Hughes Aircraft Company</a> in <a href="Culver%20City%2C%20California">Culver City</a>. Von Kármán put Parsons in touch with <a href="Herbert%20T.%20Rosenfeld">Herbert T. Rosenfeld</a>, President of the Southern Californian chapter of the <a href="American%20Technion%20Society">American Technion Society</a>a <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> group dedicated to supporting the newly created State of Israel. Rosenfeld offered Parsons a job with the Israeli rocket program and hired him to produce technical reports for them. In November 1950, as the Red Scare intensified, Parsons decided to migrate to Israel to pursue Rosenfeld's offer, but a Hughes secretary whom Parsons had asked to type up a portfolio of technical documents reported him to the FBI. She accused Parsons of espionage and attempted theft of classified company documents on the basis of some of the reports that he had sought to submit to the Technion Society.
Parsons was immediately fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; he insisted that his intentions were peaceful and that he had suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.

The Review Board still considered Parsons a liability because of his historical Marxist affiliations and investigations by the FBI, and in January 1952 they permanently reinstated their ban on his working for classified projects, effectively prohibiting him from working in rocketry. To make a living he founded the Parsons Chemical Manufacturing Company, which was based in North Hollywood and created pyrotechnics and explosives such as fog effects and imitation gunshot wounds for the film industry, and he also returned to chemical manufacturing at the Bermite Powder Company in Saugus.
Parsons reconciled with Cameron, and they resumed their relationship and moved into a former coach house on Orange Grove Avenue. Parsons converted its large, first-floor laundry room into a home laboratory to work on his chemical and pyrotechnic projects, homebrew <a href="absinthe">absinthe</a> and stockpile his materials. They let out the upstairs bedrooms and began holding parties that were attended largely by bohemians and members of the <a href="Beat%20Generation">Beat Generation</a>, along with old friends including Forman, Malina and Cornog. They also congregated at the home of Andrew Haley, who lived on the same street. Though Parsons in his mid-thirties was a "prewar relic" to the younger attendees, the raucous socials often lasted until dawn and frequently attracted police attention. Parsons also founded a new Thelemite group known as "the Witchcraft", whose beliefs revolved around a simplified version of Crowley's Thelema and Parsons' own Babalon prophecies. He offered a course in its teachings for a ten dollar fee, which included a new Thelemic belief system called "the Gnosis", a version of <a href="Christian%20Gnosticism">Christian Gnosticism</a> with <a href="Sophia%20%28wisdom%29">Sophia</a> as its godhead and the Christian God as its <a href="demiurge">demiurge</a>. He also collaborated with Cameron on "Songs for the Witch Woman", a collection of poems which she illustrated that was published in 2014.

Parsons and Cameron decided to travel to Mexico for a few months, both for a vacation and for Parsons to take up a job opportunity establishing an explosives factory for the Mexican government. They hoped that this would facilitate a move to Israel, where they could start a family, and where Parsons could bypass the U.S. government to recommence his rocketry career. He was particularly disturbed by the presence of the FBI, convinced that they were spying on him.

On June 17, 1952, a day before their planned departure, Parsons received a rush order of explosives for a film set and began to work on it in his home laboratory. An explosion destroyed the lower part of the building, during which Parsons sustained mortal wounds. His right forearm was amputated, his legs and left arm were broken and a hole was torn in the right side of his face. Despite these critical injuries, Parsons was found conscious by the upstairs lodgers. He tried to communicate with the arriving ambulance workers, who rushed him to the <a href="Huntington%20Hospital">Huntington Memorial Hospital</a>, where he was declared dead approximately thirty-seven minutes after the explosion. When his mother, Ruth, was informed of the events, she immediately took a fatal overdose of <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s. Cameron learned of her husband's death from reporters at the scene when she returned home from grocery shopping.

Pasadena Police Department criminologist Don Harding led the official investigation; he concluded that Parsons had been mixing <a href="Mercury%28II%29%20fulminate">fulminate of mercury</a> in a coffee can when he dropped it on the floor, causing the initial explosion, which worsened when it came into contact with other chemicals in the room. Forman considered this likely, stating that Parsons often had sweaty hands and could easily have dropped the can. Some of Parsons' colleagues rejected this explanation, saying that he was very attentive about safety. Two colleagues from the Bermite Powder Company described Parsons' work habits as "scrupulously neat" and "exceptionally cautious". The latter statement—from chemical engineer George Santymers—insisted that the explosion must have come from beneath the floorboards, implying an organized plot to kill Parsons. Harding accepted that these inconsistencies were "incongruous" but described the manner in which Parsons had stored his chemicals as "criminally negligent", and noted that Parsons had previously been investigated by the police for illegally storing chemicals at the Parsonage. He also found a morphine-filled syringe at the scene, suggesting that Parsons was narcotized. The police saw insufficient evidence to continue the investigation and closed the case as an accidental death.

Both Wolfe and Smith suggested that Parsons' death had been suicide, stating that he had suffered from depression for some time. Others theorized that the explosion was an assassination planned by <a href="Howard%20Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> in response to Parsons' suspected theft of Hughes Aircraft Company documents. Cameron became convinced that Parsons had been murdered either by police officers seeking vengeance for his role in the conviction of Earl Kynette or by <a href="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionists</a> opposed to his work for Israel. One of Cameron's friends, the artist <a href="Renate%20Druks">Renate Druks</a>, later stated her belief that Parsons had died in a rite designed to create a <a href="homunculus">homunculus</a>. His death has never been definitively explained.

The immediate aftermath of the explosion attracted the interest of the U.S. media, making headline news in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>". These initial reports focused on Parsons' prominence in rocketry but neglected to mention his occult interests. When asked for comment, Aerojet secretary-treasurer T.E. Beehan said that Parsons "liked to wander, but he was one of the top men in the field". Within a few days, journalists had discovered his involvement in Thelema and emphasized this in their reports.

A private prayer service was held for Parsons at the funeral home where his body was cremated. Cameron scattered his ashes in the Mojave Desert, before burning most of his possessions. She later tried to perform astral projection to commune with him. The O.T.O. also held a memorial service—with attendees including Helen and Sara—at which Smith led the Gnostic Mass.

Parsons was considered effeminate as a child; in adult life he exhibited an attitude of <a href="machismo">machismo</a>. His FBI file described him as "potentially bisexual" and he once expressed experiencing a <a href="latent%20homosexuality">latent homosexuality</a>. The actor <a href="Paul%20Mathison">Paul Mathison</a> said he had had a gay relationship with Parsons in the 1950s, though this was disputed by others who knew him and Cameron. Parsons had the reputation of being a womanizer, and was notorious for frequently flirting and having sexual liaisons with female staff members at JPL and Aerojet. He was also known for personal eccentricity such as greeting house guests with a large pet snake around his neck, driving to work in a rundown <a href="Pontiac%23Pontiac%201926%E2%80%931942">Pontiac</a>, and using a mannequin dressed in a tuxedo with a bucket labelled "The Resident" as his mailbox.

As well as a fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons was also a keen <a href="Shooting">shooter</a>; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating explosives such as <a href="firecrackers">firecrackers</a> and <a href="smoke%20bombs">smoke bombs</a>, and was known to spend hours at a time in the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.

As well as intense bursts of creativity, Parsons suffered from what he described as "manic hysteria and depressing melancholy." His father Marvel, after suffering a near-fatal heart attack, died as a psychiatric patient at <a href="St.%20Elizabeths%20Hospital">St. Elizabeths Hospital</a> in Washington D.C. diagnosed with severe <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">clinical depression</a>, a condition Pendle suggested the younger Parsons inherited.

Parsons' obituary listed him as a member of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Industrial%20Association">Army Ordnance Association</a>, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the <a href="American%20Chemical%20Society">American Chemical Society</a>, the <a href="American%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>, anddespite his lack of an academic degreethe <a href="Sigma%20Xi">Sigma Xi</a> fraternity. It also stated that he had turned down several <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary degree</a>s.

Parsons adhered to the occult philosophy of Thelema, which had been founded in 1904 by the English occultist Aleister Crowley following a spiritual revelation that he had in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, Egypt, when—according to Crowley's accounts—a spirit being known as <a href="Aiwass">Aiwass</a> dictated to him a prophetic text known as "The Book of the Law". Prior to becoming aware of Thelema and Crowley, Parsons' interest in esotericism was developed through his reading of "<a href="The%20Golden%20Bough">The Golden Bough</a>" (1890), a work in <a href="comparative%20mythology">comparative mythology</a> by Scottish <a href="Social%20anthropology">social anthropologist</a> <a href="James%20George%20Frazer">James George Frazer</a>. Parsons had also attended lectures on <a href="Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29">Theosophy</a> by philosopher <a href="Jiddu%20Krishnamurti">Jiddu Krishnamurti</a> with his first wife Helen, but disliked the belief system's sentiment of "the good and the true". During rocket tests, Parsons often recited Crowley's poem "Hymn to Pan" as a <a href="good%20luck%20charm">good luck charm</a>. He took to addressing Crowley as his "Most Beloved Father" and signed off to him as "thy son, John".

In July 1945, Parsons gave a speech to the Agape Lodge, in which he attempted to explain how he felt that "The Book of the Law" could be made relevant to "modern life". In this speech, which was subsequently published under the title of "Doing Your Will", he examined the Thelemite concept of <a href="True%20Will">True Will</a>, writing that:

Parsons identified four obstacles that prevented humans from achieving and performing their True Will, all of which he connected with fear: the fear of incompetence, the fear of the opinion of others, the fear of hurting others, and the fear of insecurity. He insisted that these must be overcome, writing that "The Will must be freed of its fetters. The ruthless examination and destruction of taboos, complexes, frustrations, dislikes, fears and disgusts hostile to the Will is essential to progress."

Though Parsons was a lifelong devotee to Thelema, he grew weary of and eventually left the Ordo Templi Orientis—the religious organization that began propagating Thelema under Crowley's leadership from the 1910s—which Parsons viewed, despite the disagreement of Crowley himself, as excessively hierarchical and impeding upon the rigorous spiritual and philosophical practice of True Will, describing the O.T.O. as "an excellent training school for adepts, but hardly an appropriate Order for the manifestation of Thelema". In this sense Parsons was described by Carter as an "almost fundamentalist" Thelemite who placed "The Book of the Law"s <a href="dogma">dogma</a> above all other doctrine.

From early on in his career, Parsons took an interest in socialism and communism, views that he shared with his friend <a href="Frank%20Malina">Frank Malina</a>. Under the influence of another friend, Sidney Weinbaum, the two joined a communist group in the late 1930s, with Parsons reading <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> literature, but he remained unconvinced and refused to join the American Communist Party. Malina asserted that this was because Parsons was a "political romantic", whose attitude was more anti-authoritarian than anti-capitalist. Parsons later became critical of the <a href="Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism">Marxist–Leninist</a> government of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> led by <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, sarcastically commenting that

During the era of <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> and the Second Red Scare in the early 1950s, Parsons was questioned regarding his former links to the communist movement, by which time he denied any connection to it, instead describing himself as "an individualist" who was both anti-communist and anti-fascist. In reaction to the McCarthyite <a href="red-baiting">red-baiting</a> of scientists, he expressed disdain that

Parsons was politically influenced by Thelemawhich holds to the ethical code of "<a href="Do%20what%20thou%20wilt">Do what thou wilt</a>"equating this principle to the libertarian views of some of the <a href="Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">Founding Fathers of the United States</a> in his article "Freedom is a Lonely Star", writing that by his own time these values had been "sold out by America, and for that reason the heart of America is sick and the soul of America is dead." He proceeded to criticize many aspects of contemporary U.S. society, particularly the police force, remarking that "The police mind is usually of a sadistic and homicidal trend" and noting that they carried out the "ruthless punishment of symbolic scapegoats" such as African-Americans, prostitutes, alcoholics, homeless people and sociopolitical radicals, under the pretense of a country that upheld "liberty and justice for all."

To bring about a freer future Parsons believed in <a href="Sexual%20revolution">liberalizing attitudes to sexual morality</a> stating that, in his belief, the publication of the <a href="Kinsey%20report">Kinsey report</a> and development of the <a href="Psychonautics">psychonautical</a> sciences had as significant an influence on Western society as the creation of the <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> and the development of <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a>. He also believed that in the future the restrictions on sexual morality within society should be abolished in order to bring about greater freedom and individuality. Parsons concluded that

<a href="Jack%20Cashill">Jack Cashill</a>, American studies professor at <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a>, argues that "Although his literary career never got much beyond pamphleteering and an untitled anti-war, anti-capitalist manuscript", Parsons played a significant role—greater than that of <a href="Church%20of%20Satan">Church of Satan</a> founder <a href="Anton%20LaVey">Anton LaVey</a>—in shaping the Californian counterculture of the 1960s and beyond through his influence on contemporaries such as Hubbard and Heinlein. <a href="Hugh%20Urban">Hugh Urban</a>, religious studies professor at <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a>, cites Parsons' Witchcraft group as precipitating the <a href="Modern%20paganism">neopagan</a> revival of the 1950s.

Science fiction writer and occultist <a href="Robert%20Anton%20Wilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a> described Parsons' political writings as exemplifying an "ultra-individualist" who exhibited a "genuine sympathy for working people", strongly empathized with <a href="feminism">feminism</a> and held an antipathy toward <a href="patriarchy">patriarchy</a> comparable to that of <a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>, arguing in this context that Parsons was an influence on the <a href="Libertarianism%20in%20the%20United%20States">American libertarian</a> and <a href="Anarchism%20in%20the%20United%20States">anarchist</a> movements of the 20th century. Parsons was also supportive of the creation of the State of Israel, making plans to emigrate there when his military security clearance was revoked.

In the decades following his death, Parsons was well remembered among the Western esoteric community; his scientific recognition frequently amounted to a footnote. For instance, English Thelemite <a href="Kenneth%20Grant">Kenneth Grant</a> suggested that Parsons' Babalon Working marked the start of the appearance of <a href="flying%20saucers">flying saucers</a> in the skies, leading to phenomena such as the <a href="Roswell%20UFO%20incident">Roswell UFO incident</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Arnold%20UFO%20sighting">Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting</a>. Cameron postulated that the <a href="1952%20Washington%2C%20D.C.%20UFO%20incident">1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident</a> was a spiritual reaction to Parsons' death. In 1954 she portrayed Babalon in American Thelemite <a href="Kenneth%20Anger">Kenneth Anger</a>'s short film "<a href="Inauguration%20of%20the%20Pleasure%20Dome">Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome</a>", viewing this cinematic depiction of a Thelemic ritual as aiding the literal invocation of Babalon begun by Parsons' working, and later said that his "Book of the AntiChrist" prophecies were fulfilled through the manifestation of Babalon in her person.

In December 1958 JPL was integrated into the newly established National Aeronautics and Space Administration, after having built the "<a href="Explorer%201">Explorer 1</a>" satellite that commenced America's <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a> with the Soviet Union. Aerojet was contracted by NASA to build the main engine of the <a href="Apollo%20Command/Service%20Module">Apollo Command/Service Module</a>, and the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Orbital%20Maneuvering%20System">Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System</a>. In a letter to <a href="Frank%20Malina">Frank Malina</a>, von Kármán ranked Parsons first in a list of figures he viewed as most important to modern rocketry and the foundation of the American space program. According to Richard Metzger, Wernher von Braun—who was nicknamed "The Father of Rocket Science"—once argued that Parsons was more worthy of this moniker. In October 1968 Malina, a pioneer in <a href="sounding%20rocket">sounding rocket</a>ry, gave a speech at JPL in which he highlighted Parsons' contribution to the U.S. rocket project, and lamented how it had come to be neglected, crediting him for making "key contributions to the development of <a href="Storable%20propellant%23Liquid%20propellant">storable propellants</a> and of long duration solid propellant agents that play such an important role in American and European space technology."

The same month JPL held an open access event to mark the 32nd anniversary of its foundation—which featured a "nativity scene" of mannequins reconstructing the November 1936 photograph of the GALCIT Group—and erected a monument commemorating their first rocket test on Halloween 1936. Among the aerospace industry, JPL was nicknamed as standing for "Jack Parsons' Laboratory" or "Jack Parsons Lives". The <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> decided to name a crater on the <a href="far%20side%20%28Moon%29">far side</a> of the Moon <a href="Parsons%20%28crater%29">Parsons</a> after him in 1972. JPL later credited him for making "distinctive technical innovations that advanced early efforts" in rocket engineering, with aerospace journalist Craig Covault stating that the work of Parsons, Qian Xuesen and the GALCIT Group "planted the seeds for JPL to become preeminent in space and rocketry."

Many of Parsons' writings were posthumously published as "Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword" in 1989, a compilation co-edited by Cameron and O.T.O. leader Hymenaeus Beta (ceremonial name of musician <a href="William%20Breeze">William Breeze</a>), which incited a resurgence of interest in Parsons within occult and countercultural circles. For example, comic book artist and occultist <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a> noted Parsons as a creative influence in a 1998 interview with <a href="Clifford%20Meth">Clifford Meth</a>. The Cameron-Parsons Foundation was founded as an incorporated company in 2006, with the intention of conserving and promoting Parsons' writings and Cameron's artwork, and in 2014 Fulger Esoterica published "Songs for the Witch Woman"—a limited edition book of poems by Parsons with illustrations by Cameron, released to coincide with his centenary. An exhibition of the same name was held at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles</a>.

In 1999 <a href="Feral%20House">Feral House</a> published the biography "Sex and Rockets: The Occult World of Jack Parsons" by John Carter, who expressed the opinion that Parsons had accomplished more in under five years of research than Robert H. Goddard had in his lifetime, and said that his role in the development of rocket technology had been neglected by historians of science; Carter thought that Parsons' abilities and accomplishments as an occultist had been overestimated and exaggerated among Western esotericists, emphasizing his disowning by Crowley for practicing magic beyond his grade. Feral House republished the work as a new edition in 2004, accompanied with an introduction by Robert Anton Wilson. Wilson believed that Parsons was "the one single individual who contributed the most to rocket science", describing him as being "very strange, very brilliant, very funny, [and] very tormented", and considering it noteworthy that the day of Parsons' birth was the predicted beginning of the apocalypse advocated by <a href="Charles%20Taze%20Russell">Charles Taze Russell</a>, the founder of the <a href="Bible%20Student%20movement">Bible Student movement</a>.

A second biography of Parsons was published in 2005 through <a href="Weidenfeld%20%26amp%3B%20Nicolson">Weidenfeld & Nicolson</a> with the title "Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons"; it was written by George Pendle, who described Parsons as "the <a href="Che%20Guevara">Che Guevara</a> of occultism" and said that although Parsons "would not live to see his dream of space travel come true, he was essential to making it a reality." Pendle considered that the cultural stigma attached to Parsons' occultism was the primary cause of his low public profile, noting that "Like many scientific mavericks, Parsons was eventually discarded by the establishment once he had served his purpose." It was this unorthodox mindset,  creatively facilitated by his science fiction fandom and "willingness to believe in magic's efficacy",  Pendle argued, "that allowed him to break scientific barriers previously thought to be indestructible"—commenting that Parsons "saw both space and magic as ways of exploring these new frontiers—one breaking free from Earth literally and metaphysically."

L. Ron Hubbard's role in Parsons' Agape Lodge and the ensuing yacht scam were explored in Russell Miller's 1987 Hubbard biography "<a href="Bare-faced%20Messiah">Bare-faced Messiah</a>". Parsons' involvement in the Agape Lodge were also discussed by Martin P. Starr in his history of the American Thelemite movement, "The Unknown God: W.T. Smith and the Thelemites", published by Teitan Press in 2003. "<a href="The%20QI%20Book%20of%20the%20Dead">The QI Book of the Dead</a>" (2004), based on <a href="QI">the BBC game show</a>, included a Parsons obituary. Parsons' occult partnership with Hubbard was also mentioned in <a href="Alex%20Gibney">Alex Gibney</a>'s 2015 documentary film "<a href="Going%20Clear%20%28film%29">Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief</a>", produced by <a href="HBO">HBO</a>.

Before his death, Parsons appeared in science fiction writer Anthony Boucher's murder-mystery novel "Rocket to the Morgue" (1942) under the guise of <a href="mad%20scientist">mad scientist</a> character Hugo Chantrelle. Another fictional character based on Parsons was Courtney James, a wealthy socialite who features in L. Sprague de Camp's 1956 short time travel story "A Gun for Dinosaur". In 2005 "Pasadena Babalon", a stage play about Parsons written by George D. Morgan and directed by <a href="Brian%20Brophy">Brian Brophy</a>, premiered at Caltech as a production by its theater Arts Group in 2010, the same year Cellar Door Publishing released Richard Carbonneau and Robin Simon Ng's <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a>, "The Marvel: A Biography of Jack Parsons". In 2012 the <a href="Science%20%28TV%20network%29">Science Channel</a> broadcast a documentary dramatization titled "Magical Jet Propulsion" in an episode of its "" television series. Parsons was portrayed by English actor <a href="Adam%20Howden">Adam Howden</a>. Independent record label <a href="Drag%20City%20%28record%20label%29">Drag City</a> released "Parsons' Blues", an instrumental tribute single by experimental rock act <a href="Six%20Organs%20of%20Admittance">Six Organs of Admittance</a>.

In 2014 <a href="AMC%20Networks">AMC Networks</a> announced plans for a serial television dramatization of Parsons' life, but in 2016 it was reported that the series "will not be going forward." In 2017 the project was adopted as a web television series by <a href="CBS%20All%20Access">CBS All Access</a>. "<a href="Strange%20Angel">Strange Angel</a>", produced by <a href="Mark%20Heyman">Mark Heyman</a> and starring Irish actor <a href="Jack%20Reynor">Jack Reynor</a>, premiered in June 2018.

In 2018 Parsons was featured in an episode of the Amazon series <a href="Lore%20%28TV%20series%29">Lore</a>.

Peter Martyr Vermigli

Peter Martyr Vermigli (8 September 149912 November 1562) was an Italian-born <a href="Reformed%20theologian">Reformed theologian</a>. His early work as a reformer in <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20Italy">Catholic</a> <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and his decision to flee for <a href="Protestantism%23Reformation%20proper">Protestant</a> northern Europe influenced many other Italians to convert and flee as well. In England, he influenced the <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England%23Reformation">Edwardian Reformation</a>, including the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>ic service of the 1552 "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>". He was considered an authority on the Eucharist among the Reformed churches, and engaged in controversies on the subject by writing treatises. Vermigli's "Loci Communes", a compilation of excerpts from his <a href="exegesis">biblical commentaries</a> organized by the topics of <a href="systematic%20theology">systematic theology</a>, became a standard Reformed theological textbook.

Born in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, Vermigli entered a <a href="religious%20order">religious order</a> and was appointed to influential posts as <a href="abbot">abbot</a> and <a href="prior">prior</a>. He came in contact with leaders of the Italian "<a href="spirituali">spirituali</a>" reform movement, and read Protestant theologians such as <a href="Martin%20Bucer">Martin Bucer</a> and <a href="Ulrich%20Zwingli">Ulrich Zwingli</a>. Through reading these works and studying the Bible and the <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a>, he came to accept Protestant beliefs about <a href="Salvation%20in%20Christianity">salvation</a> and the Eucharist. To satisfy his conscience and avoid persecution by the <a href="Roman%20Inquisition">Roman Inquisition</a>, he fled Italy for Protestant northern Europe. He ultimately arrived in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a> where he taught on the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> of the Bible under Bucer. English reformer <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a> invited him to take <a href="Regius%20Professor%20of%20Divinity">an influential post</a> at <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> where he continued to teach on the Bible. He also defended his Eucharistic beliefs against <a href="History%20of%20Catholic%20eucharistic%20theology">Catholic proponents</a> of <a href="transubstantiation">transubstantiation</a> in a public disputation. Vermigli was forced to leave England on the accession of the Catholic <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Queen Mary</a>. As a <a href="Marian%20exiles">Marian exile</a> he returned to Strasbourg and his former teaching position. Vermigli's beliefs regarding the Eucharist and <a href="predestination">predestination</a> clashed with those of leading <a href="Lutheranism">Lutherans</a> in Strasbourg, so he transferred to Reformed <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a> where he taught until his death in 1562.

Vermigli's best-known theological contribution was defending the <a href="Reformed%20doctrine%20of%20the%20Eucharist">Reformed doctrine of the Eucharist</a> against Catholics and <a href="Eucharist%20in%20Lutheranism">Lutherans</a>. Contrary to the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation, Vermigli did not believe that the bread and wine are changed into Christ's body and blood. He also disagreed with the Lutheran view that Christ's body is ubiquitous and so <a href="Real%20presence%20of%20Christ%20in%20the%20Eucharist">physically present</a> at the Eucharist. Instead, Vermigli taught that Christ remains in <a href="Heaven%20%28Christianity%29">Heaven</a> even though he is offered to those who partake of the Eucharist and received by believers.

Vermigli developed a strong doctrine of <a href="double%20predestination">double predestination</a> independently of <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>. His interpretation was that <a href="God%20in%20Christianity">God</a>'s will determines both damnation as well as salvation. Vermigli's belief is similar but not identical to Calvin's. Vermigli's <a href="political%20theology">political theology</a> was important in the <a href="Elizabethan%20religious%20settlement">Elizabethan religious settlement</a>; he provided theological justification for <a href="Royal%20Supremacy">Royal Supremacy</a>, the doctrine that the king of a territory, rather than any ecclesiastical authority, rules the church.

Vermigli was born in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, the center of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Florence">Florentine Republic</a>, on 8September 1499 to Stefano di Antonio Vermigli, a wealthy shoemaker, and Maria Fumantina. He was christened Piero Mariano the following day. He was the eldest of three children; his sister Felicita Antonio was born in 1501 and his brother Antonio Lorenzo Romulo was born in 1504. His mother taught him <a href="Latin">Latin</a> before enrolling him in a school for children of <a href="Nobility%20of%20Italy%23Pre-unification">noble Florentines</a>. She died in 1511, when Piero was twelve. Vermigli was attracted to the <a href="Priesthood%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic priesthood</a> from an early age. In 1514 he became a <a href="Catholic%20novitiate">novice</a> at the <a href="Badia%20Fiesolana">Badia Fiesolana</a>, a monastery of the <a href="Canons%20Regular%20of%20the%20Lateran">Canons Regular of the Lateran</a>. The Lateran Canons were one of several institutions born out of a fifteenth-century religious reform movement. They emphasized strict discipline, and moved from house to house rather than remaining in one place. They also sought to provide leadership in urban areas. Peter's sister followed him into the monastic life, becoming a nun the same year.

On completing his novitiate in 1518, Vermigli took the name Peter Martyr after the thirteenth-century <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> Saint <a href="Peter%20of%20Verona">Peter of Verona</a>. The Lateran Congregation had recently decided that promising young ordinands should be sent to the monastery of <a href="Saint%20John%20of%20Verdara">Saint John of Verdara</a> in <a href="Padua">Padua</a> to study <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, so Vermigli was sent there. The <a href="University%20of%20Padua">University of Padua</a>, with which Saint John of Verdera was loosely affiliated, was a very prestigious institution at the time. At Padua, Vermigli received a thorough training in <a href="Thomism">Thomistic</a> <a href="scholasticism">scholasticism</a> and an appreciation for <a href="Augustine">Augustine</a> and <a href="Christian%20humanism">Christian humanism</a>. Vermigli was determined to read Aristotle in his original language despite the lack of <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> teachers, so he taught himself. He also made the acquaintance of prominent reform-minded theologians <a href="Pietro%20Bembo">Pietro Bembo</a>, <a href="Reginald%20Pole">Reginald Pole</a>, and <a href="Marcantonio%20Flaminio">Marcantonio Flaminio</a>.

Vermigli was <a href="Holy%20Orders">ordained</a> in 1525 and probably received his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Divinity">Doctor of Divinity</a> around that time. The <a href="chapter-general">chapter-general</a> of the Congregation elected him to the office of public preacher in 1526. His first series of sermons was in <a href="Brescia">Brescia</a> later that year. He then preached for three years, travelling around northern and central Italy. Unlike the practice of other preaching orders which usually only preached at <a href="Lent">Lent</a> and <a href="Advent">Advent</a>, the Augustinians preached year-round. He also gave lectures on the Bible as well as <a href="Homer">Homer</a> in Lateran Congregation houses.

In 1530 Vermigli was appointed <a href="vicar">vicar</a> of the monastery at <a href="San%20Giovanni%20in%20Monte%2C%20Bologna">San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna</a>. There he learned <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> from a local <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Italy">Jewish</a> doctor so he could read the Old Testament scriptures in their original language. Even among those who sought deeper biblical study, it was uncommon for clergy to learn Hebrew, though not unheard of. In 1533 the chapter-general elected Vermigli <a href="abbot">abbot</a> of the two Lateran monasteries in <a href="Spoleto">Spoleto</a>. At this post he was also responsible for two <a href="convent">convent</a>s. The discipline in the monastic houses in Vermigli's care had been lax before his arrival, and they had become a source of scandal in Spoleto. There was also a history of power struggle between the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Spoleto">Bishop of Spoleto</a>, <a href="Francesco%20Eroli">Francesco Eroli</a>, and the Spoletan abbacy, to the point that the bishop had excommunicated Vermigli's predecessor, only to be overturned by Rome. Vermigli brought order to his houses and mended the relationship with the bishop.

The chapter-general re-elected Vermigli to the Spoletan abbacy in 1534 and again in 1535, but he was not elected to lead any house the following year. He may have been identified as a promising reformer who could help with reform efforts in higher places. Vermigli was in contact with the Catholic leaders working on the "<a href="Consilium%20de%20emendanda%20ecclesia">Consilium de emendanda ecclesia</a>", an internal report on potential reforms of the Church commissioned by <a href="Pope%20Paul%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Pope Paul III</a>. He may have even travelled to Rome to assist in writing it.

The Congregation elected Vermigli abbot of the monastery at <a href="San%20Pietro%20ad%20Aram%2C%20Naples">San Pietro ad Aram, Naples</a> in 1537. There he became acquainted with <a href="Juan%20de%20Vald%C3%A9s">Juan de Valdés</a>, a leader of the "<a href="spirituali">spirituali</a>" movement. Valdés introduced Vermigli to the writings of Protestant reformers. Toward the end of his time in Naples, he read <a href="Martin%20Bucer">Martin Bucer</a>'s commentaries on the <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>s and the <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a>, and <a href="Huldrych%20Zwingli">Zwingli</a>'s "De vera et falsa religione". Reading these works was an act of ecclesiastical defiance, but not an uncommon one in reformist circles. Vermigli seems to have slowly moved in a Protestant direction primarily through study of the Bible and the <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a>, especially Augustine. He probably read Protestant literature critically; it was common for those in reform-minded circles to do so while remaining in the Catholic Church. Vermigli embraced the Protestant doctrine of <a href="justification%20by%20faith%20alone">justification by faith alone</a> during this time, and he had probably rejected the traditional <a href="Sacraments%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic view of the sacraments</a>. Vermigli also seems to have influenced Valdés. Scholars believe that Valdés's strong doctrine of <a href="double%20predestination">double predestination</a>, that God has chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation, was learned from Vermigli. Vermigli in turn had acquired it from his study of either <a href="Gregory%20of%20Rimini">Gregory of Rimini</a> or <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> at Padua.

Vermigli's move away from orthodox Catholic belief became apparent in 1539 when he preached on <a href="1%20Corinthians%203">1 Corinthians 3</a>:9–17, a passage commonly used as proof of the doctrine of <a href="purgatory">purgatory</a>. Vermigli did not take this view in his preaching, though he did not openly deny the existence of purgatory. <a href="Saint%20Cajetan">Gaetano da Thiene</a>, an opponent of the "spirituali", reported his suspicions of Vermigli to the Spanish viceroy of Naples <a href="Pedro%20%C3%81lvarez%20de%20Toledo%2C%20Marquis%20of%20Villafranca">Don Pedro de Toledo</a>, who prohibited Vermigli's preaching. The prohibition was removed on Vermigli's appeal to <a href="Holy%20See">Rome</a>, with which he received some help from powerful friends he had made in Padua, such as Cardinals Pole and Bembo. Despite this controversy, Vermigli continued to rise in the Lateran Congregation. He was made one of four visitors by the chapter-general in 1540. The visitors assisted the <a href="rector%20general">rector general</a> by inspecting the Congregation's religious houses.
In 1541 the Congregation elected Vermigli to the important post of prior of <a href="Basilica%20of%20San%20Frediano">Basilica of San Frediano</a> in <a href="Lucca">Lucca</a>. The prior at San Frediano exercised some <a href="Ecclesiastical%20jurisdiction">episcopal authority</a> over half the city, as well as control of the Lateran's religious houses. As at his earlier post in Spoleto, the monks of the San Frediano monastery as well as the clergy of Lucca were known for moral laxity, which led to an openness to the new Lutheran religion there. Vermigli saw his task as one of education as well as moral correction. He set up a college based on humanist principles of education and modeled on the newly founded <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">St John's College, Cambridge</a>, and <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20College%2C%20Oxford">Corpus Christi College, Oxford</a>. Instruction was in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Among the professors were the humanists <a href="Immanuel%20Tremellius">Immanuel Tremellius</a>, <a href="Paolo%20Lacizi">Paolo Lacizi</a>, <a href="Celio%20Secondo%20Curione">Celio Secondo Curione</a>, and <a href="Girolamo%20Zanchi">Girolamo Zanchi</a>, all of whom would later convert to Protestantism. The Congregation recognized Vermigli's work by appointing him to a disciplinary commission of seven canons in May 1542.

Vermigli was widely respected and very cautious. He was able to continue his reform efforts in Lucca without any suspicion of unorthodox views, despite a papal meeting there with <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Charles V</a> in 1541. His eventual downfall was caused by two of his followers, one of whom openly questioned papal authority and another who celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist. The reconstitution of the <a href="Roman%20Inquisition">Roman Inquisition</a> in 1542 may have been in part a response to fear that Lucca and other cities would defect from the Catholic Church. The authorities of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Lucca">Republic of Lucca</a> began to fear that their political independence from the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> was at stake if their city continued to be viewed as a Protestant haven. Bans on Protestant books heretofore ignored were enforced, religious feasts which had been dropped were reinstated, and religious processions were scheduled to assure Rome of Lucca's loyalty.

Vermigli was summoned to a Chapter Extraordinary of the Lateran Congregation, and his friends warned him that he had powerful adversaries. These increasingly foreboding events contributed to his decision to ignore the summons and flee, but he was finally persuaded by his conscience against the <a href="Mass%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Masses</a> he was bound to perform. Vermigli fled Lucca for <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a> on 12 August 1542 by horse with three of his canons. There he celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist for the first time. When he stopped in Florence, staying in Badia Fiesolana where he had entered religious life, Vermigli learned that <a href="Bernardino%20Ochino">Bernardino Ochino</a> had arrived there. Vermigli convinced Ochino, a popular preacher with Protestant leanings, to flee Italy as well. On 25 August Vermigli left for <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a> by way of <a href="Ferrara">Ferrara</a> and <a href="Verona">Verona</a>.

Once Vermigli arrived in Zürich he was questioned regarding his theological views by several Protestant leaders including <a href="Heinrich%20Bullinger">Heinrich Bullinger</a>, <a href="Konrad%20Pellikan">Konrad Pellikan</a>, and <a href="Rudolph%20Gualther">Rudolph Gualther</a>. They eventually determined that he could be allowed to teach Protestant theology, but there was no position vacant for him to fill there or in <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, where he went next. In a letter to his former congregation in Lucca, he explained his motives for leaving and also expressed discouragement at not being able to find a post. Basler humanist assisted him with money, and reformer <a href="Oswald%20Myconius">Oswald Myconius</a> recommended him to Martin Bucer in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, with whose writings Vermigli was already familiar. Vermigli moved to Strasbourg and became a close personal friend and ally of Bucer, who granted him the chair of Old Testament at the <a href="Jean%20Sturm%20Gymnasium">Senior School</a>, succeeding <a href="Wolfgang%20Capito">Wolfgang Capito</a>. He began by lecturing on the <a href="minor%20prophets">minor prophets</a>, followed by <a href="Book%20of%20Lamentations">Lamentations</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Exodus</a>, and <a href="Leviticus">Leviticus</a>. Vermigli was delighted to be able to teach from the original-language text of the Old Testament, as many of his students could read Hebrew. He was well-liked by his students and fellow scholars. Vermigli was known for precision, simplicity, and clarity of speech in contrast to Bucer's propensity for digressions which sometimes left his students lost.

Two of Vermigli's former colleagues in Lucca—Lacizi and Tremellius—would join him in Strasbourg. In 1544 he was elected <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> of <a href="St.%20Thomas%2C%20Strasbourg">St. Thomas Church, Strasbourg</a>. In 1545 Vermigli married his first wife, Catherine Dammartin, a former nun from <a href="Metz">Metz</a>. Catherine knew no Italian, and Peter very little German, so it is assumed that they conversed in Latin.

<a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a> acceded to the English throne in 1547, and the Protestant reformers there hoped to take the opportunity to more thoroughly reform the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. Archbishop <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a> invited Vermigli and Ochino to assist in the effort. In addition, the victory of Catholic Emperor <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a> in the <a href="Schmalkaldic%20War">Schmalkaldic War</a> and the resulting <a href="Augsburg%20Interim">Augsburg Interim</a> led to a hostile environment for Protestants in Germany. Vermigli accepted the invitation in November and sailed with Ochino to England. In 1548, he replaced <a href="Richard%20Smyth%20%28theologian%29">Richard Smyth</a>, becoming the second <a href="Regius%20Professor%20of%20Divinity">Regius Professor of Divinity</a> at <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a>. This was a very influential post at a university which had been slow to accept reform.

On arriving in Oxford, Vermigli began lecturing on <a href="1%20Corinthians">1 Corinthians</a>, denouncing Catholic doctrines of purgatory, <a href="clerical%20celibacy">clerical celibacy</a>, and <a href="lent">lent</a>en fasting. He then spoke against the <a href="Eucharist%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic doctrine of the Eucharist</a>, the most sensitive area of disagreement between Protestants and Catholics in England at the time. Conservative faculty, led by Smyth, challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal <a href="disputation">disputation</a>. Smyth fled to <a href="St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a> and finally to <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a> before the disputation could be held, so three Catholic divines, <a href="William%20Tresham%20%28priest%29">William Tresham</a>, <a href="William%20Chedsey">William Chedsey</a> and <a href="Morgan%20Phillips%20%28priest%29">Morgan Phillips</a>, stepped forward to take his place. The disputation was held in 1549 before <a href="Richard%20Cox%20%28bishop%29">Richard Cox</a>, the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Oxford">University Chancellor</a> and a firm Protestant. It focused on the doctrine of <a href="transubstantiation">transubstantiation</a>, with Vermigli's opponents arguing for it and him against. Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument, but did not formally declare a winner. The disputation put Vermigli at the forefront of debates over the nature of the Eucharist.

In 1549, a series of uprisings known as the <a href="Prayer%20Book%20Rebellion">Prayer Book Rebellion</a> forced Vermigli to leave Oxford and take up residence at <a href="Lambeth%20Palace">Lambeth Palace</a> with Cranmer. The rebellion involved conservative opposition to a <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a> liturgy, which was imposed with the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" at <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> in 1549. Rioters in the streets of Oxford threatened Vermigli with death. At Lambeth, Vermigli assisted Cranmer by helping write sermons against the rebellion. After some time he returned to Oxford, where he was made first canon of <a href="Christ%20Church%20Cathedral%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church</a> in January 1551. Vermigli, the first <a href="Clerical%20marriage">married priest</a> at Oxford, caused controversy by bringing his wife into his rooms overlooking <a href="St%20Aldate%27s%2C%20Oxford">Fish Street</a> at the <a href="Great%20Quadrangle">Great Quadrangle</a>. His windows were smashed several times until he moved to a location in the cloisters, where he built a fortified stone study.

Vermigli became deeply involved in English church politics. In 1550, he and Martin Bucer provided recommendations to Cranmer for additional changes to the "Book of Common Prayer" Eucharistic liturgy. Vermigli supported the church's position in the <a href="vestarian%20controversy">vestarian controversy</a>, over whether bishop <a href="John%20Hooper%20%28bishop%29">John Hooper</a> should be forced to wear a <a href="surplice">surplice</a>. Vermigli agreed with Hooper's desire to rid the church of elaborate garments, but he did not believe they were strictly prohibited. He advised Hooper to respect the authority of his superiors. Vermigli was probably instrumental in convincing Hooper to drop his opposition in February 1551. In October 1551 he participated in a commission to rewrite the <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> of England. In the Winter he assisted in the writing of a draft set of such laws, which was published by <a href="John%20Foxe">John Foxe</a> as "<a href="Reformatio%20legum%20ecclesiasticarum">Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum</a>" in 1552.

King Edward died in 1553, followed by the accession of <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary I of England</a>, who opposed the Protestant reformers. Vermigli was placed under house arrest for six months, and his <a href="Counter-Reformation">Catholic opponents</a> at Oxford would likely have had him executed, as Cranmer eventually was in 1556. Despite this risk, he agreed to a public disputation with Cranmer against the new Catholic establishment, but this never came to fruition because Cranmer was imprisoned. Vermigli was able to receive permission from the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20England">Privy Council</a> to leave England, and was advised by Cranmer to do so.

Vermigli's wife, Catherine, had become well known in Oxford for her piety and ministry to expectant mothers. She also enjoyed carving faces into plum stones. She had died childless in the February before Vermigli left. Soon after Vermigli's departure, <a href="Reginald%20Pole">Cardinal Pole</a> had her disinterred and thrown on a dungheap. Following the accession of Protestant Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth</a> in 1558, she was re-interred with the relics of Saint <a href="Frithuswith">Frithuswith</a> in Christ Church Cathedral.

Vermigli arrived in Strasbourg in October 1553, where he was restored to his position at the Senior School and began lecturing on <a href="Book%20of%20Judges">Judges</a> as well as Aristotle's "<a href="Nicomachean%20Ethics">Nicomachean Ethics</a>". Vermigli often gathered with other <a href="Marian%20exiles">Marian exiles</a> for study and prayer in his home. His lectures on Judges often addressed the political issues relevant for the exiles, such as the right to resist a tyrant. Since Vermigli's departure and the death of Bucer in 1551, Lutheranism had gained influence in Strasbourg under the leadership of <a href="Johann%20Marbach">Johann Marbach</a>. Vermigli had been asked to sign both the <a href="Augsburg%20Confession">Augsburg Confession</a> and the <a href="Wittenberg%20Concord">Wittenberg Concord</a> as a condition of being reinstalled as professor. He was willing to sign the Augsburg Confession, but not the Concordat, which affirmed a bodily presence of Christ in the Eucharist. He was retained and reappointed anyway, but controversy over the Eucharist as well as Vermigli's strong doctrine of double predestination continued with the Lutherans. Another professor in Strasbourg, Girolamo Zanchi, who had converted to Protestantism while under Vermigli in Lucca, shared Vermigli's convictions regarding the Eucharist and predestination. Zanchi and Vermigli became friends and allies. Vermigli's increasing alienation from the Lutheran establishment led him in 1556 to accept an offer from Heinrich Bullinger to teach at the <a href="Carolinum%2C%20Z%C3%BCrich">Carolinum</a> school in Zürich. <a href="John%20Jewel">John Jewel</a>, a fellow Marian exile, came along with him.
In Zürich, Vermigli succeeded Konrad Pellikan as the chair of Hebrew, a position he would hold until his death. He married his second wife, Catarina Merenda of Brescia, Italy, in 1559. Vermigli was able to share his teaching duties with fellow Hebraist <a href="Theodor%20Bibliander">Theodor Bibliander</a>, allowing him time to study and prepare the notes from his previous lectures for publication. He began lecturing on the books of <a href="Books%20of%20Samuel">Samuel</a> and <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Kings</a>. While in Zürich, Vermigli declined invitations to desirable positions in Geneva, <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>, and England.

Vermigli's Eucharistic views were accepted in Zürich, but he ran into controversy over his doctrine of double predestination. Similarly to <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>, Vermigli believed that in some way God wills the damnation of those not chosen for salvation. Vermigli attempted to avoid confrontation over the issue, but Bibliander began to openly attack him in 1557, at one point allegedly challenging him to a duel with a double-edged axe. Bibliander held the <a href="Erasmian">Erasmian</a> view that God only predestines that those who believe in him will be saved, not the salvation of any individual. Reformed theologians during this time held a variety of beliefs about predestination, and Bullinger's position is ambiguous, but they agreed that God sovereignly and <a href="unconditional%20election">unconditionally</a> chooses whom to save. They believed salvation is not based on any characteristic of a person, including <a href="Sola%20fide">their faith</a>. Bullinger and the Zürich church did not necessarily agree with Vermigli's double predestinarian view, but Bibliander's view was deemed unallowable. He was dismissed in 1560, in part to assure other Reformed churches of the Zürich church's orthodoxy. Vermigli was involved in predestinarian controversy again when Zanchi, who had remained in Strasbourg when Vermigli left for Zürich, was accused of heretical teachings on the Eucharist and predestination by the Lutheran Johann Marbach. Vermigli was selected to write the official judgement of the Zürich church on the matter in a statement signed by Bullinger and other leaders December1561. His affirmation of a strong doctrine of predestination represented the opinion of the Zürich church as a whole.

Vermigli attended the abortive <a href="Colloquy%20at%20Poissy">Colloquy at Poissy</a> in the summer of 1561 with <a href="Theodore%20Beza">Theodore Beza</a>, a conference held in France with the intention of reconciling Catholics and Protestants. He was able to converse with <a href="queen%20mother">queen mother</a> of France <a href="Catherine%20de%27Medici">Catherine de'Medici</a> in her native Italian. He contributed a speech on the Eucharist, arguing that <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>' words "<a href="Words%20of%20Institution">this is my body</a>" at the <a href="Last%20Supper">Last Supper</a> were figurative rather than literal. Vermigli's health was already declining when he succumbed to an epidemic <a href="fever">fever</a> in 1562. He died 12 November 1562 in his Zürich home, attended by physician <a href="Conrad%20Gesner">Conrad Gesner</a>. He was buried in the <a href="Grossm%C3%BCnster">Grossmünster</a> cathedral, where his successor <a href="Josias%20Simler">Josias Simler</a> gave a funeral oration, which was published and is an important source for Vermigli's later biographies. Vermigli had had two children by his second wife, Caterina, while he was alive, but they did not survive infancy. Four months after his death she bore him a daughter, Maria.

Vermigli is best known for the "Loci Communes" (Latin for "commonplaces"), a collection of the topical discussions scattered throughout his biblical commentaries. The "Loci Communes" was compiled by <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> minister <a href="Robert%20Masson">Robert Masson</a> and first published in 1576, fourteen years after Vermigli's death. Vermigli had apparently expressed a desire to have such a book published, and it was urged along by the suggestion of Theodore Beza. Masson followed the pattern of John Calvin's "Institutes of the Christian Religion" to organize it. Fifteen editions of the "Loci Communes" between 1576 and 1656 spread Vermigli's influence among Reformed Protestants. <a href="Anthony%20Marten">Anthony Marten</a> translated the "Loci Communes" into English in 1583, adding to it considerably.

Vermigli published commentaries on I Corinthians (1551), Romans (1558), and Judges (1561) during his lifetime. He was criticized by his colleagues in Strasbourg for withholding his lectures on books of the Bible for years rather than sending them to be published. Calling his lecture notes on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and the Minor Prophets "brief and hasty annotations", he found it difficult to find time to prepare them for publication. His colleagues edited and published some of his remaining works on the Bible after his death: prayers on the Psalms (1564) and commentaries on Kings (1566), Genesis (1569), and Lamentations (1629). Vermigli followed the humanist emphasis on seeking the original meaning of scripture, as opposed to the often fanciful and arbitrary allegorical readings of the medieval exegetical tradition. He occasionally adopted an allegorical reading to interpret the Old Testament as having to do with Christ <a href="typology%20%28theology%29">typologically</a>, but he did not utilize the <a href="Allegorical%20interpretation%20of%20the%20Bible">"quadriga" method</a> of medieval biblical interpretation, where each passage has four levels of meaning. Vermigli's command of Hebrew, as well as his knowledge of <a href="rabbinic%20literature">rabbinic literature</a>, surpassed that of most of his contemporaries, including Calvin, Luther, and Zwingli.

Vermigli published an account of his disputation with Oxford Catholics over the Eucharist in 1549, along with a treatise further explaining his position. The disputation largely dealt with the doctrine of transubstantiation, which Vermigli strongly opposed, but the treatise was able to put forward Vermigli's own Eucharistic theology. Vermigli's Eucharistic views, as expressed in the disputation and treatise, were influential in the changes to the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" of 1552. Vermigli weighed in again on Eucharistic controversy in England in 1559. His "Defense Against Gardiner" was in reply to <a href="Stephen%20Gardiner">Stephen Gardiner</a>'s 1552 and 1554 "Confutatio Cavillationum", itself a reply to the late Thomas Cranmer's work. At 821 <a href="folio">folio</a> pages, it was the longest work on the subject published during the Reformation period.

Vermigli's Eucharistic polemical writing was initially directed against Catholics, but beginning in 1557 he began to involve himself in debates with Lutherans. Many Lutherans during this time argued that Christ's body and blood were physically present in the Eucharist because they are <a href="omnipresence">ubiquitous</a>, or everywhere. In 1561, <a href="Johannes%20Brenz">Johannes Brenz</a> published a work defending such a view, and Vermigli's friends convinced him to write a response. The result, the "Dialogue on the Two Natures in Christ", was written in the form of a <a href="dialogue">dialogue</a> between Orothetes ("Boundary Setter"), a defender of the Reformed doctrine that Christ's body is physically located in Heaven, and Pantachus ("Everywhere"), whose speeches are largely taken directly from Brenz's work. Brenz published a response in 1562, to which Vermigli began to prepare a rebuttal, but he died before he was able to complete it.

Vermigli was primarily a teacher of scripture rather than a systematic theologian, but his lasting influence is mostly associated with his doctrine of the Eucharist. This can be explained by the close relationship he saw between exegesis of scripture and theological reflection. Vermigli's method of biblical commentary, similar to that of Martin Bucer, was to include extended discussions of doctrinal topics treated by the biblical texts. Like other Protestants, he believed <a href="sola%20scriptura">scripture alone</a> held supreme authority in establishing truth. Nevertheless, he was familiar with the church fathers to a higher degree than many of his contemporaries, and he constantly referred to them. He saw value in the fathers because they had discovered insights into the scriptures that he might not have found, and because many of his Catholic opponents placed great weight on arguments from patristic authority. Often, though, he used the fathers as support for interpretations he had already reached on his own and was not concerned when his interpretation had no patristic precedent.
Vermigli is best known for his polemics against the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and for the Reformed doctrine of "sacramental presence". He argued that transubstantiation, the belief that the substance of bread and wine are changed into Christ's body and blood, was not based on any argument from scripture. He also argued on the basis of <a href="hypostatic%20union">Chalcedonian Christology</a>, that because Christ retained his divine nature when he <a href="incarnation%20of%20Christ">became man</a> (the divine nature was added to the human nature rather than his human nature being made divine), the substance of the bread and wine remain the same rather than being changed into the substance of Christ's body and blood. Finally, he used the analogy of the believer's <a href="union%20with%20Christ">union with Christ</a> against the idea of transubstantiation. Because the believer retains their human nature even though God has joined them with Christ, it follows that the Eucharistic elements do not need to be transformed to be Christ's body. Instead of the substance of the elements changing into Christ's flesh, Vermigli emphasized the action of the sacrament as an instrument through which Christ is offered to the partaker. He also disagreed with the <a href="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> belief that the Eucharist is simply symbolic or figurative, a view called <a href="memorialism">memorialism</a> or tropism.

Vermigli did not see predestination as central to his theological system, but it became associated with him because of controversies in which he became entangled. Vermigli developed his doctrine independently of John Calvin, and before Calvin published it in his 1559 "<a href="Institutes%20of%20the%20Christian%20Religion">Institutes of the Christian Religion</a>". Vermigli saw God as sovereign over every event, and believed that all things, including evil, were used by him to accomplish his will. Nevertheless, Vermigli did not hold that humans are compelled to good or evil actions. Vermigli held that God had chosen some people for salvation on the basis of <a href="grace%20alone">grace or unmerited favor alone</a>, with no consideration for any good or evil characteristics, a view referred to as "<a href="unconditional%20election">unconditional election</a>". Vermigli also believed that God passed over the <a href="reprobate">reprobate</a>, those who were not elected to salvation. He saw this as included in the will of God, but different in character from the decision to choose the elect for salvation. Because all people have fallen into sin, the reprobating will of God treats them as by-nature fallen and deserving of damnation. Vermigli's formulation of reprobation as within God's decree while distinct from his saving election was slightly different from Calvin's. Calvin saw predestination to salvation and reprobation as two sides of a single decree. Vermigli's doctrine was to prove more influential in the Reformed confessions. In his early formulation of predestination (ca. 1543-1544), Vermigli drew heavily on Aquinas's "<a href="Summa%20Theologica">Summa theologiae</a>".

Vermigli's biblical writings frequently address political matters. He followed the Aristotelian view that political authority is instituted to promote <a href="virtue">virtue</a>, and that this includes religion as the chief virtue. Vermigli defended the standard English Protestant doctrine of <a href="Royal%20Supremacy">Royal Supremacy</a>, that kings, so long as they obey God, have the right to rule the church in their land, while Christ is the only head of the <a href="Christian%20Church">universal church</a>. He denied the idea that the pope or any other ecclesiastical authority could exercise authority over a civil ruler such as the king, an important issue at the time given the conflicts between <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VII">Pope Clement VII</a> and <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a> at the beginning of the English Reformation. While Vermigli charged the civil magistrate with enforcing religious duties, he followed Augustine's distinction in the "<a href="City%20of%20God%20%28book%29">City of God</a>" between the spiritual sphere (in Vermigli's words the "inward motions of the mind") and the "outward discipline" of society. The civil magistrate's authority is only on external matters rather than inward and spiritual religious devotion. Vermigli's theological justification for Royal Supremacy was used by the framers of the 1559 <a href="Elizabethan%20Settlement">Elizabethan Settlement</a>, the imposition of Protestant worship based on the "Book of Common Prayer" as the state religion.

Vermigli's leadership in Lucca left it arguably the most thoroughly Protestant city in Italy. The Inquisition led many of these Protestants to flee, creating a significant population of Protestant refugees in Geneva. Several important leaders in the Reformation can also be tied to Vermigli's work in Lucca, including Girolamo Zanchi and Bernardino Ochino.

Scholars have increasingly recognized the importance of figures other than John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli in the early formation of the Reformed tradition. <a href="Richard%20Muller%20%28theologian%29">Richard Muller</a>, a chief authority on the development of this movement, has argued that Vermigli, <a href="Wolfgang%20Musculus">Wolfgang Musculus</a>, and Heinrich Bullinger were as influential if not more influential than Calvin on the development of Reformed theology in the sixteenth century. Vermigli was a transitional figure between the Reformation period and the period known as <a href="Reformed%20orthodoxy">Reformed orthodoxy</a>. In the Reformed orthodox period, the theology first articulated by Reformation figures was codified and systematized. Theologians increasingly resorted to the methods of <a href="scholastic%20theology">scholastic theology</a> and the tradition of Aristotelianism. Vermigli was the first of the Reformed scholastic theologians, and he influenced later scholastics Theodore Beza and Girolamo Zanchi.

Vermigli had a profound influence on the English Reformation through his relationship with Thomas Cranmer. Before his contact with Vermigli, Cranmer held Lutheran Eucharistic views. Vermigli seems to have convinced Cranmer to adopt a Reformed view, which changed the course of the English Reformation since Cranmer was primarily responsible for revisions to the Book of Common Prayer and writing the <a href="Forty-two%20Articles">Forty-two Articles</a>. Vermigli had a direct role in the modifications of the "Book of Common Prayer" of 1552. He is also believed to have contributed to, if not written, the article on predestination found in the Forty-two Articles of Religion of 1553. In Elizabethan Oxford and Cambridge, Vermigli's theology was arguably more influential than that of Calvin. His political theology in particular shaped the Elizabethan religious settlement and his authority was constantly invoked in the controversies of this period.

Various of Vermigli's writings were printed about 110 times between 1550 and 1650. The 1562 "Loci Communes" became a standard textbook in Reformed theological education. He was popular especially with English readers of theology in the seventeenth century. <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a> probably consulted his commentary on Genesis when writing "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>". The English edition of the "Loci Communes" was brought to the <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> where it was an important textbook at <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a>. More of Vermigli's works were found in the libraries of seventeenth-century <a href="Harvard%20Divinity%20School%23History">Harvard divinity students</a> than those of Calvin. Vermigli's works were highly regarded by <a href="New%20England">New England</a> Puritan theologians such as <a href="John%20Cotton%20%28minister%29">John Cotton</a> and <a href="Cotton%20Mather">Cotton Mather</a>.

Imagism

Imagism was a movement in early 20th-century Anglo-American poetry that favored precision of <a href="imagery">imagery</a> and clear, sharp language. It has been described as the most influential movement in <a href="English%20poetry">English poetry</a> since the <a href="Pre-Raphaelites">Pre-Raphaelites</a>. As a poetic style it gave <a href="literary%20modernism">modernism</a> its start in the early 20th century, and is considered to be the first organized modernist literary movement in the English language. Imagism is sometimes viewed as "a succession of creative moments" rather than a continuous or sustained period of development. <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Taupin">René Taupin</a> remarked that "it is more accurate to consider Imagism not as a doctrine, nor even as a poetic school, but as the association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles".

The Imagists rejected the sentiment and discursiveness typical of much <a href="Romantic%20poetry">Romantic</a> and <a href="Victorian%20literature%23Poetry">Victorian poetry</a>, in contrast to their contemporaries, the <a href="Georgian%20poets">Georgian poets</a>, who were generally content to work within that tradition. Imagism called for a return to what were seen as more <a href="Classicism">Classical</a> values, such as directness of presentation and economy of language, and a willingness to experiment with non-traditional verse forms; Imagists used <a href="free%20verse">free verse</a>. A characteristic feature of Imagism is its attempt to isolate a single image to reveal its essence. This feature mirrors contemporary developments in "<a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a>" art, especially <a href="Cubism">Cubism</a>. Although Imagism isolates objects through the use of what <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a> called "luminous details", Pound's <a href="ideogrammic%20method">ideogrammic method</a> of juxtaposing concrete instances to express an abstraction is similar to Cubism's manner of synthesizing multiple perspectives into a single image.

Imagist publications appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured works by many of the most prominent <a href="modernist">modernist</a> figures in <a href="modernist%20poetry%20in%20English">poetry</a> and other fields, including <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, <a href="H.D.">H.D.</a> (Hilda Doolittle), <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a>, <a href="William%20Carlos%20Williams">William Carlos Williams</a>, <a href="F.%20S.%20Flint">F. S. Flint</a>, and <a href="T.%20E.%20Hulme">T. E. Hulme</a>. The Imagists were centered in London, with members from Great Britain, Ireland and the United States. Somewhat unusually for the time, a number of women writers were major Imagist figures.

Well-known poets of the <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian era</a> of the 1890s, such as <a href="Alfred%20Austin">Alfred Austin</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Phillips">Stephen Phillips</a>, and <a href="William%20Watson%20%28poet%29">William Watson</a>, had been working very much in the shadow of <a href="Alfred%20Tennyson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tennyson">Tennyson</a>, producing weak imitations of the poetry of the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>. They continued to work in this vein into the early years of the 20th century. As the new century opened, Austin was still the serving British <a href="Poet%20Laureate">Poet Laureate</a>, a post he held up to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had a large audience; volumes of verse published in that time included <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>'s "The Dynasts", <a href="Christina%20Rossetti">Christina Rossetti</a>'s posthumous "Poetical Works", <a href="Ernest%20Dowson">Ernest Dowson</a>'s "Poems", <a href="George%20Meredith">George Meredith</a>'s "Last Poems", <a href="Robert%20W.%20Service">Robert Service's</a> "Ballads of a Cheechako" and <a href="John%20Masefield">John Masefield</a>'s "Ballads and Poems". Future <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize</a> winner <a href="William%20Butler%20Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a> was devoting much of his energy to the <a href="Abbey%20Theatre">Abbey Theatre</a> and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize</a> for Literature was awarded to <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>.

The origins of Imagism are to be found in two poems, "Autumn" and "A City Sunset" by <a href="T.%20E.%20Hulme">T. E. Hulme</a>. These were published in January 1909 by the <a href="Poets%27%20Club">Poets' Club</a> in London in a booklet called "For Christmas MDCCCCVIII". Hulme was a student of mathematics and philosophy; he had been involved in setting up the club in 1908 and was its first secretary. Around the end of 1908, he presented his paper "<a href="A%20Lecture%20on%20Modern%20Poetry">A Lecture on Modern Poetry</a>" at one of the club's meetings. Writing in <a href="A.%20R.%20Orage">A. R. Orage</a>'s magazine "The New Age", the poet and critic <a href="F.%20S.%20Flint">F. S. Flint</a> (a champion of free verse and modern French poetry) was highly critical of the club and its publications. From the ensuing debate, Hulme and Flint became close friends. In 1909, Hulme left the Poets' Club and started meeting with Flint and other poets in a new group which Hulme referred to as the "Secession Club"; they met at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in London's <a href="Soho">Soho</a> to discuss plans to reform contemporary poetry through free verse and the <a href="waka%20%28poetry%29">tanka</a> and <a href="haiku">haiku</a> and through the removal of all unnecessary verbiage from poems. The interest in <a href="Japanese%20poetry">Japanese verse forms</a> can be placed in a context of the late <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> and <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian</a> revival of interest in <a href="Chinoiserie">Chinoiserie</a> and <a href="Japonism">Japonism</a> as witnessed in the 1890s vogue for <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28collector%29">William Anderson's</a> Japanese prints donated to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, performances of <a href="Noh">Noh</a> plays in London, and the success of <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>'s operetta "<a href="The%20Mikado">The Mikado</a>" (1885). Direct literary models were available from a number of sources, including <a href="F.%20V.%20Dickins">F. V. Dickins</a>'s 1866 "Hyak nin is'shiu, or, Stanzas by a Century of Poets, Being Japanese Lyrical Odes", the first English-language version of the "<a href="Hyakunin%20Issh%C5%AB">Hyakunin Isshū</a>", a 13th-century anthology of 100 waka, the early 20th-century critical writings and poems of <a href="Sadakichi%20Hartmann">Sadakichi Hartmann</a>, and contemporary French-language translations.

The American poet Ezra Pound was introduced to the group in April 1909 and found their ideas close to his own. In particular, Pound's studies of Romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the condensed, direct expression that he detected in the writings of <a href="Arnaut%20Daniel">Arnaut Daniel</a>, <a href="Dante">Dante</a>, and <a href="Guido%20Cavalcanti">Guido Cavalcanti</a>, amongst others. For example, in his 1911–12 series of essays "<a href="I%20gather%20the%20limbs%20of%20Osiris">I gather the limbs of Osiris</a>", Pound writes of Daniel's line "pensar de lieis m'es repaus" ("it rests me to think of her"), from the <a href="canzone">canzone</a> "En breu brizara'l temps braus": "You cannot get statement simpler than that, or clearer, or less rhetorical". These criteria—directness, clarity and lack of <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>—were to be amongst the defining qualities of Imagist poetry. Through his friendship with <a href="Laurence%20Binyon">Laurence Binyon</a>, Pound had already developed an interest in <a href="Japanese%20art">Japanese art</a> by examining <a href="Nishiki-e">Nishiki-e</a> prints at the British Museum, and he quickly became absorbed in the study of related Japanese verse forms.

In a 1915 article in "La France", the French critic <a href="Remy%20de%20Gourmont">Remy de Gourmont</a> described the Imagists as descendants of the French <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolists</a>. Pound emphasised that influence in a 1928 letter to the French critic and translator <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Taupin">René Taupin</a>. He pointed out that Hulme was indebted to the Symbolist tradition, via William Butler Yeats, <a href="Arthur%20Symons">Arthur Symons</a> and the <a href="Rhymers%27%20Club">Rhymers' Club</a> generation of British poets and <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Mallarm%C3%A9">Mallarmé</a>. Taupin concluded in his 1929 study that however great the divergence of technique and language "between the image of the Imagist and the 'symbol' of the Symbolists[,] there is a difference only of precision". In 1915, Pound edited the poetry of another 1890s poet, <a href="Lionel%20Johnson">Lionel Johnson</a>. In his introduction, he wrote

In 1911, Pound introduced two other poets to the Eiffel Tower group: his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle (who had started signing her work <a href="H.D.">H.D.</a>) and her future husband <a href="Richard%20Aldington">Richard Aldington</a>. These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models, especially <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a>, an interest that Pound shared. The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting with them in the British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were "Imagistes" and even appended the signature "H.D. Imagiste" to some poems they were discussing.

When <a href="Harriet%20Monroe">Harriet Monroe</a> started her "<a href="Poetry%20%28magazine%29">Poetry</a>" magazine in 1911, she had asked Pound to act as foreign editor. In October 1912, he submitted thereto three poems each by H.D. and Aldington under the "Imagiste" rubric, with a note describing Aldington as "one of the 'Imagistes'". This note, along with the appendix note ("The Complete Works of T. S. Hulme") in Pound's book "Ripostes" (1912), are considered to be the first appearances of the word "Imagiste" (later anglicised to "Imagist") in print.

Aldington's poems, "Choricos", "To a Greek Marble", and "Au Vieux Jardin", were in the November issue of "Poetry", and H.D.'s, "Hermes of the Ways", "Priapus", and "Epigram", appeared in the January 1913 issue; Imagism as a movement was launched. "Poetry"s April issue published what came to be seen as "Imagism's enabling text", the haiku-like poem of Pound titled "In a Station of the Metro":

The March 1913 issue of "Poetry" contained "A Few Don'ts by an Imagiste" and the essay entitled "Imagisme" both written by Pound, with the latter being attributed to Flint. The latter contained this succinct statement of the group's position:

Pound's note opened with a definition of an image as "that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time". Pound goes on to state,"It is better to present one Image in a lifetime than to produce voluminous works". His list of "don'ts" reinforced his three statements in "Imagism", while warning that they should not be considered as dogma but as the "result of long contemplation". Taken together, these two texts comprised the Imagist programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past. F. S. Flint commented "we have never claimed to have invented the moon. We do not pretend that our ideas are original."

The 1916 preface to "Some Imagist Poets" comments ""Imagism" does not merely mean the presentation of pictures. "Imagism" refers to the manner of presentation, not to the subject."

Determined to promote the work of the Imagists, and particularly of Aldington and H.D., Pound decided to publish an anthology under the title "<a href="Des%20Imagistes">Des Imagistes</a>". It was first published in <a href="Alfred%20Kreymborg">Alfred Kreymborg</a>'s little magazine "<a href="The%20Glebe%20%28literary%20magazine%29">The Glebe</a>" and was later published in 1914 by Alfred and Charles Boni in New York and by <a href="Harold%20Monro">Harold Monro</a> at the <a href="Poetry%20Bookshop">Poetry Bookshop</a> in London. It became one of the most important and influential English-language collections of modernist verse. Included in the thirty-seven poems were ten poems by Aldington, seven by H.D., and six by Pound. The book also included work by <a href="F.%20S.%20Flint">F. S. Flint</a>, <a href="Skipwith%20Cannell">Skipwith Cannell</a>, <a href="Amy%20Lowell">Amy Lowell</a>, <a href="William%20Carlos%20Williams">William Carlos Williams</a>, <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, <a href="Ford%20Madox%20Ford">Ford Madox Ford</a>, <a href="Allen%20Upward">Allen Upward</a> and <a href="John%20Cournos">John Cournos</a>. <a href="Max%20Michelson">Max Michelson</a> was also another included in the important 1963 anthology by William Pratt "The Imagist Poem: Modern Poetry in Miniature".

Pound's editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, <a href="Pre-Raphaelite">Pre-Raphaelite</a>-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, "I Hear an Army", which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of "<a href="A%20Portrait%20of%20the%20Artist%20as%20a%20Young%20Man">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</a>" in "<a href="The%20Egoist%20%28periodical%29">The Egoist</a>". Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming <a href="quatrain">quatrain</a>s. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the <a href="troubadour">troubadour</a>s and <a href="Guido%20Cavalcanti">Guido Cavalcanti</a>. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.

The following year, Pound and Flint fell out over their different interpretations of the history and goals of the group arising from an article on the history of Imagism written by Flint and published in "The Egoist" in May 1915. Flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of the Eiffel Tower poets, especially <a href="Edward%20Storer">Edward Storer</a>. Pound, who believed that the "Hellenic hardness" that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of H.D. and Aldington was likely to be diluted by the "custard" of Storer, was to play no further direct role in the history of the Imagists. He went on to co-found the <a href="Vorticists">Vorticists</a> with his friend, the painter and writer <a href="Wyndham%20Lewis">Wyndham Lewis</a>.

Around this time, the American Imagist <a href="Amy%20Lowell">Amy Lowell</a> moved to London, determined to promote her own work and that of the other Imagist poets. Lowell was a wealthy heiress from Boston whose brother <a href="Abbott%20Lawrence%20Lowell">Abbott Lawrence Lowell</a> was President of Harvard University from 1909 to 1933. She loved <a href="Keats">Keats</a> and cigars. She was also an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group. Lowell was determined to change the method of selection from Pound's autocratic editorial attitude to a more democratic manner. This new editorial policy was stated in the Preface to the first anthology to appear under her leadership: "In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of our former Anthology. Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor, each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best, the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared in book form." The outcome was a series of Imagist anthologies under the title "Some Imagist Poets". The first of these appeared in 1915, planned and assembled mainly by H.D. and Aldington. Two further issues, both edited by Lowell, were published in 1916 and 1917. These three volumes featured most of the original poets, plus the American <a href="John%20Gould%20Fletcher">John Gould Fletcher</a>, but not Pound, who had tried to persuade Lowell to drop the Imagist name from her publications and who sardonically dubbed this phase of Imagism "Amygism".

Lowell persuaded <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a> to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes, making him the only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an Imagist. <a href="Marianne%20Moore">Marianne Moore</a> also became associated with the group during this period. However, with World War I as a backdrop, the times were not easy for "<a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a>" literary movements (Aldington, for example, spent much of the war at the front), and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the Imagists as a movement.

In 1929, <a href="Walter%20Lowenfels">Walter Lowenfels</a> jokingly suggested that Aldington should produce a new Imagist anthology. Aldington, by now a successful novelist, took up the suggestion and enlisted the help of Ford and H.D. The result was the "Imagist Anthology 1930", edited by Aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell, who had died, Cannell, who had disappeared, and Pound, who declined. The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the Imagists in the history of 20th-century poetry.

Of the poets who were published in the various Imagist anthologies, Joyce, Lawrence and Aldington are now primarily remembered and read as novelists. Marianne Moore, who was at most a fringe member of the group, carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an Imagist concern with compression of language. <a href="William%20Carlos%20Williams">William Carlos Williams</a> developed his poetic along distinctly American lines with his variable <a href="metrical%20foot">foot</a> and a diction he claimed was taken "from the mouths of Polish mothers". Both Pound and H.D. turned to writing long poems, but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an Imagist legacy. Most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the context of the history of Imagism.

Despite the movement's short life, Imagism would deeply influence the course of <a href="modernist%20poetry%20in%20English">modernist poetry in English</a>. Richard Aldington, in his 1941 memoir, writes: "I think the poems of Ezra Pound, H.D., Lawrence, and Ford Madox Ford will continue to be read. And to a considerable extent T. S. Eliot and his followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the Imagists."

On the other hand, <a href="Wallace%20Stevens">Wallace Stevens</a> found shortcomings in the Imagist approach: "Not all objects are equal. The vice of imagism was that it did not recognize this."
With its demand for hardness, clarity and precision and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant subjective emotions Imagism had later effects that are demonstratable in <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>'s 'Preludes' and 'Morning at the Window' and in <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a>'s animal and flower pieces. The rejection of conventional verse forms in the nineteen-twenties owed much to the Imagists' repudiation of the <a href="Georgian%20Poetry">Georgian Poetry</a> style.

Imagism, which had made free verse a discipline and a legitimate poetic form, influenced a number of poetry circles and movements. Its influence can be seen clearly in the work of the <a href="Objectivist%20poets">Objectivist poets</a>, who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of Pound and Williams. The Objectivists worked mainly in free verse. Clearly linking Objectivism's principles with Imagism's, <a href="Louis%20Zukofsky">Louis Zukofsky</a> insisted, in his introduction to the 1931 Objectivist issue of "Poetry", on writing "which is the detail, not mirage, of seeing, of thinking with the things as they exist, and of directing them along a line of melody." Zukofsky was a major influence on the <a href="Language%20poets">Language poets</a>, who carried the Imagist focus on formal concerns to a high level of development. <a href="Basil%20Bunting">Basil Bunting</a>, another Objectivist poet, was a key figure in the early development of the <a href="British%20Poetry%20Revival">British Poetry Revival</a>, a loose movement that also absorbed the influence of the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Renaissance">San Francisco Renaissance</a> poets. In his seminal 1950 essay "Projective Verse", <a href="Charles%20Olson">Charles Olson</a>, the theorist of the <a href="Black%20Mountain%20poets">Black Mountain poets</a>, wrote "ONE PERCEPTION MUST IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY LEAD TO A FURTHER PERCEPTION"; his credo derived from and supplemented the Imagists.

Among the Beats, <a href="Gary%20Snyder">Gary Snyder</a> and <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> in particular were influenced by the Imagist emphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry. <a href="William%20Carlos%20Williams">William Carlos Williams</a> was another who had a strong effect on the Beat poets, encouraging poets like <a href="Lew%20Welch">Lew Welch</a> and writing an introduction for the book publication of Ginsberg's "<a href="Howl">Howl</a>" (1955).

Holkham National Nature Reserve

Holkham National Nature Reserve is England's largest <a href="national%20nature%20reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">national nature reserve</a> (NNR). It is on the <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> coast between <a href="Burnham%20Overy">Burnham Overy Staithe</a> and <a href="Blakeney%2C%20Norfolk">Blakeney</a>, and is managed by <a href="Natural%20England">Natural England</a> with the cooperation of the <a href="Holkham%20Estate">Holkham Estate</a>. Its comprise a wide range of <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s, including <a href="grazing%20marsh">grazing marsh</a>, woodland, <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a>, <a href="sand%20dunes">sand dunes</a> and <a href="intertidal%20zone">foreshore</a>. The reserve is part of the <a href="North%20Norfolk%20Coast%20Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>, and the larger area is additionally protected through <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a>, <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> (SPA) and <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar</a> listings, and is part of both an <a href="Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB) and a <a href="World%20Network%20of%20Biosphere%20Reserves">World Biosphere Reserve</a>. Holkham NNR is important for its wintering <a href="Anatidae">wildfowl</a>, especially <a href="pink-footed%20goose">pink-footed geese</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20wigeon">Eurasian wigeon</a> and <a href="brant%20goose">brant geese</a>, but it also has breeding <a href="wader">wader</a>s, and attracts many <a href="bird%20migration">migrating birds</a> in autumn. A number of scarce <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s and plants can be found in the dunes, and the reserve is one of the only two sites in the UK to have an <a href="Euroleon%20nostras">antlion</a> colony.

This stretch of coast originally consisted of salt marshes protected from the sea by ridges of <a href="shingle%20beach">shingle</a> and sand, and <a href="Holkham%20Camp">Holkham's Iron Age fort</a> stood at the end of a sandy spit surrounded by the tidal wetland. The <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a> navigated the creeks to establish <a href="Holkham">Holkham</a> village, but access to the former harbour was stopped by drainage and reclamation of the marshes between the coast and the shingle ridge which started in the 17th century, and was completed in 1859. The Holkham estate has been owned by the Coke family, later <a href="Earl%20of%20Leicester">Earls of Leicester</a> since 1609, and their seat at <a href="Holkham%20Hall">Holkham Hall</a> is opposite the reserve's Lady Anne's Drive entrance. The <a href="Thomas%20Coke%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">3rd Earl</a> planted pines on the dunes to protect the pastures reclaimed by his predecessors from wind-blown sand. The national nature reserve was created in 1967 from of the Holkham Estate and of foreshore belonging to the <a href="Crown%20Estate">Crown</a>.

The reserve has over 100,000 visitors a year, including <a href="birdwatching">birdwatchers</a> and horse riders, and is therefore significant for the local economy. The NNR has taken steps to control entry to the fragile dunes and other areas important for their animals or plants because of the damage to sensitive habitats that could be caused by unrestricted access. The dunes are an essential natural defence against the projected rises in sea level along this vulnerable coast.

The reserve lies to the north of <a href="A149%20road">A149 coast road</a>, starting just west of <a href="Burnham%20Overy">Burnham Overy Staithe</a> and extending west past <a href="Holkham">Holkham</a> to Beach Road, <a href="Wells-next-the-Sea">Wells-next-the-Sea</a>. It also includes the tidal <a href="salt%20marshes">salt marshes</a> continuing further east to <a href="Blakeney%2C%20Norfolk">Blakeney</a>. Its total area of about makes it the largest NNR in England. The reserve can be accessed by footpaths from Wells and the local villages including the <a href="Peddars%20Way">Peddars Way/Norfolk Coast</a> <a href="long-distance%20trail">long-distance trail</a> that traverses the main part of the reserve, and <a href="National%20Cycle%20Route%201">National Cycle Route 1</a> loops through the core of the NNR between Holkham and Wells. There is a car park near Holkham village at the north end of Lady Anne's Drive that gives access to two <a href="bird%20hide">bird hide</a>s, and another parking area at the end of Beach Road in Wells. To the east of the Wells channel, the reserve is mainly salt marshes and <a href="mud%20flats">mud flats</a>, and is difficult and potentially dangerous to access, although a public footpath runs along the southern edge of these tidal areas.

The <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a>es on this coast are stated in the <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI) notification document to be "among the best in Europe ... the flora is exceptionally diverse". Holkham also has good examples of <a href="dune">sand dunes</a>, and the <a href="pine">pine</a>s planted on the dunes have provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established, making this the only substantial area of woodland in the North Norfolk Coast SSSI. The dunes are created and altered by the elements, and the sand islands in Holkham Bay have formed only within the last 60 years. The flat ground inland from the dunes is reclaimed salt marsh that was used as <a href="pasture">pasture</a> until the 1940s, but converted to <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The value of the fields to wildlife was reduced by the resulting lower <a href="water%20table">water table</a>, but <a href="Natural%20England">Natural England</a>'s management measures have raised the water levels, attracting breeding and wintering birds. Water management can also be used to ensure a high water table in summer, benefiting breeding waders, and drier conditions in winter, preferred by the geese. The management of water levels and grassland increased the numbers of breeding wetland birds from 120 pairs of ten species in 1986 to 795 pairs of 26 species in 1994, and the number of wintering birds of four key wildfowl species rose from 1,215 to 17,305 in the decade from 1983/84.

Norfolk has a long history of human occupation. Both <a href="anatomically%20modern%20humans">modern</a> and <a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a> people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago, before the last <a href="glacial%20period">glaciation</a>, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> (10,000–5,000 BCE), the <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> rose, filling what is now the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as <a href="Doggerland">Doggerland</a>.

The coast at Holkham originally consisted of salt marshes protected from the sea by ridges of <a href="shingle%20beach">shingle</a> and sand.
A large Iron Age fort (<a href="Holkham%20Camp">Holkham Camp</a>) at the end of a sandy spit in the marshes could only be approached along the spit; it enclosed and remained in use until the defeat of the <a href="Iceni">Iceni</a> in 47 AD. The <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a> navigated the tidal creeks to establish Holkham, the name deriving from the Danish for "ship town".

The Holkham Estate has been owned by the Coke family since 1609, and <a href="Holkham%20Hall">Holkham Hall</a>, built by <a href="Thomas%20Coke%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Leicester%20%28fifth%20creation%29">Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester</a> between 1734 and 1764, is opposite the NNR entrance. Until the 17th century, ships could navigate the tidal creeks to reach the staithe (harbour) at Holkham village, but local landowners began to reclaim the marshes from 1639, and the final embankment at Wells was constructed by the <a href="Thomas%20Coke%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">2nd Earl</a> in 1859, completing the conversion of about to farmland. The <a href="Thomas%20Coke%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">3rd Earl</a> planted <a href="Pinus%20nigra">Corsican</a>, <a href="Maritime%20pine">maritime</a> and <a href="Scots%20pine">Scots pine</a>s on the dunes in the late 19th century to shelter the agricultural land from wind-blown sand, which is carried inland when the wind speed exceeds three metres (10 ft) per second and blows from directions between northwest to northeast.

The Holkham National Nature Reserve was created in 1967 from of the Holkham Estate and of intertidal sand and mud flats belonging to the <a href="Crown%20Estate">Crown Estate</a>. In 1986 the NNR was subsumed into the newly created North Norfolk Coast SSSI. The larger area is now additionally protected through <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a>, <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> (SPA) and <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar</a> listings, and is part of the <a href="Norfolk%20Coast%20AONB">Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a>. The coast from Holkham NNR to <a href="Salthouse">Salthouse</a>, together with <a href="Scolt%20Head%20Island">Scolt Head Island</a>, is a <a href="World%20Network%20of%20Biosphere%20Reserves">Biosphere Reserve</a>.

As many as 50,000 <a href="pink-footed%20goose">pink-footed geese</a>, 13,000 <a href="Eurasian%20wigeon">Eurasian wigeon</a> and 7,000 <a href="brant%20goose">brent geese</a> winter at Holkham, making it of international importance for these species. Up to 400 <a href="greater%20white-fronted%20goose">white-fronted geese</a> and a few <a href="bean%20goose">tundra bean geese</a> may join the wildfowl flocks, and the odd <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>, <a href="short-eared%20owl">short-eared owl</a>, <a href="merlin%20%28bird%29">merlin</a>, <a href="western%20marsh%20harrier">marsh harrier</a> or <a href="hen%20harrier">hen harrier</a> may hunt over the fields. The shingle banks and foreshore hold wintering flocks of <a href="horned%20lark">shore larks</a>, <a href="snow%20bunting">snow bunting</a>s and <a href="twite">twite</a>, and <a href="wader">wader</a>s like <a href="red%20knot">knots</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20curlew">curlew</a>s, <a href="dunlin">dunlin</a>s and <a href="grey%20plover">grey plover</a> probe for <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s in the mud flats.

Spring <a href="bird%20migration">migration</a> is relatively quiet, although sightings of <a href="ring%20ouzel">ring ouzel</a> and <a href="common%20firecrest">firecrest</a> are possible amongst the more common arrivals. Breeding birds include <a href="northern%20lapwing">lapwings</a>, <a href="common%20snipe">common snipe</a>, <a href="pied%20avocet">pied avocet</a>s, <a href="common%20redshank">common redshank</a>s and marsh harriers on the grazing marshes, <a href="common%20ringed%20plover">ringed plovers</a> and <a href="little%20tern">little tern</a>s on the beach, and <a href="black-headed%20gull">black-headed</a>, <a href="European%20herring%20gull">herring</a> and <a href="lesser%20black-backed%20gull">lesser black-backed gull</a>s on the salt marsh. The small <a href="grey%20heron">grey heron</a> colony has been joined by <a href="little%20egret">little egret</a>s, and, from 2010, by <a href="Eurasian%20spoonbill">Eurasian spoonbill</a>s. The pines may occasionally have nesting <a href="Eurasian%20siskin">siskins</a> or <a href="common%20crossbill">common crossbill</a>s, and <a href="parrot%20crossbill">parrot crossbill</a>s bred in 1984 and 1985.

Holkham's north-facing coastal location can attract large numbers of migrating birds in autumn if the weather conditions are right, especially with a north to north-east wind. The common species may be accompanied by a <a href="wryneck">wryneck</a>, <a href="red-backed%20shrike">red-backed shrike</a> or <a href="greenish%20warbler">greenish warbler</a> in August, with <a href="goldcrest">goldcrest</a>s, <a href="thrush%20%28bird%29">thrushes</a> and <a href="finch">finch</a>es later in the season, and perhaps <a href="red-breasted%20flycatcher">red-breasted flycatcher</a>s and <a href="yellow-browed%20warbler">yellow-browed warbler</a>s. <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">Vagrant</a> rarities such as <a href="Pallas%27s%20leaf%20warbler">Pallas's</a>, <a href="Radde%27s%20warbler">Radde's</a> or <a href="dusky%20warbler">dusky warbler</a>s may occur; a <a href="red-breasted%20nuthatch">red-breasted nuthatch</a> in 1989 was the first, and, as of 2012, the only individual of its species to be recorded in the UK.

<a href="European%20hare">Brown hares</a> and <a href="European%20otter">European otter</a>s are found all along the north Norfolk coast, but <a href="red%20squirrel">red squirrel</a>s disappeared from the Holkham pines by 1981. The rare <a href="natterjack%20toad">natterjack toad</a> breeds at Holkham, one of only two sites along this coast, although the <a href="common%20frog">common frog</a>, <a href="common%20toad">common toad</a> and <a href="viviparous%20lizard">common lizard</a> are widespread in appropriate habitats.

The <a href="green%20hairstreak">green hairstreak</a>, <a href="purple%20hairstreak">purple hairstreak</a>, <a href="Polygonia%20c-album">comma</a>, <a href="hummingbird%20hawk-moth">hummingbird hawk-moth</a>, <a href="Hemaris%20fuciformis">broad-bordered bee hawk-moth</a> and <a href="ghost%20moth">ghost moth</a> are sometimes seen in the woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a <a href="Colias%20croceus">clouded yellow</a> or <a href="Nymphalis%20antiopa">Camberwell beauty</a> may also occur in some years. <a href="Grayling%20%28butterfly%29">Grayling</a>, <a href="small%20heath%20%28butterfly%29">small heath</a> and <a href="common%20blue">common blue</a> butterflies can be found in the dunes, where there is also a large <a href="Euroleon%20nostras">antlion</a> colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. <a href="Dragonfly">Dragonflies</a> include the <a href="migrant%20hawker">migrant hawker</a>, <a href="southern%20hawker">southern hawker</a> and <a href="ruddy%20darter">ruddy darter</a>.

On exposed parts of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no vegetation except possibly <a href="algae">algae</a> or <a href="Zostera%20marina">eelgrass</a>, but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains <a href="Salicornia">glassworts</a> and <a href="Suaeda%20maritima">annual seablite</a> in the most exposed regions, with a <a href="ecological%20succession">succession</a> of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first <a href="Aster%20tripolium">sea aster</a>, then mainly <a href="Limonium%20binervosum">sea lavender</a>, with <a href="Halimione%20portulacoides">sea purslane</a> in the creeks and smaller areas of <a href="Plantago%20maritima">sea plantain</a> and other common marsh plants. <a href="Suaeda%20vera">Scrubby sea-blite</a> and <a href="Limonium%20bellidifolium">matted sea lavender</a> are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.

Grasses such as <a href="Agropyron%20pungens">sea couch grass</a> and <a href="Puccinellia%20maritima">sea poa grass</a> are important in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where <a href="Ammophila%20arenaria">marram grass</a>, <a href="Elymus%20farctus">sand couch-grass</a>, <a href="Leymus%20arenarius">lyme-grass</a> and <a href="Festuca%20rubra">red fescue</a> help to bind the sand. <a href="Eryngium%20maritimum">Sea holly</a> and <a href="Carex%20arenaria">sand sedge</a> are other specialists of this arid habitat, and <a href="Petalophyllum%20ralfsii">petalwort</a> is a nationally rare <a href="bryophyte">bryophyte</a> found on damper dunes. <a href="Lotus%20corniculatus">Bird's-foot trefoil</a>, <a href="pyramidal%20orchid">pyramidal orchid</a>, <a href="Ophrys%20apifera">bee orchid</a>, <a href="Centaurium%20pulchellum">lesser centaury</a> and <a href="Carlina">carline thistle</a> flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare <a href="Helichrysum%20luteoalbum">Jersey cudweed</a> and <a href="Corynephorus%20canescens">grey hair-grass</a> are also found. The narrow 5-km (3-mi) belt of pines shelters <a href="Goodyera%20repens">creeping lady's tresses</a> and <a href="Monotropa%20hypopitys">yellow bird's nest</a>.

A 2005 survey at Holkham and five other North Norfolk coastal sites found that 39 per cent of visitors gave <a href="birdwatching">birdwatching</a> as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Holkham NNR is one of three sites within the SSSI that attract 100,000 or more visitors annually, the others being <a href="Titchwell%20Marsh">Titchwell Marsh</a> and <a href="Cley%20Marshes">Cley Marshes</a>. The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as Ringed Plovers and Little Terns, and also for wintering geese. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. The discovery of the nationally rare <a href="Geastrum%20minimum">tiny earthstar</a> <a href="fungus">fungus</a> at Holkham led its finders to state that "The survival of this species in Britain would undoubtedly benefit from the construction of a boardwalk across this fragile and frequently-visited habitat."

The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven per cent of the British population, is cordoned off in the breeding season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to <a href="Blowout%20%28geology%29">blowout</a>, the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and <a href="naturism">naturists</a> are asked to stay on the beach and keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.

The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its <a href="hinterland">hinterland</a> into three zones for tourism development purposes. Holkham dunes, along with <a href="Holme%20Dunes">Holme Dunes</a> and <a href="Blakeney%20Point">Blakeney Point</a>, were considered to be sensitive habitats already suffering from visitor pressure, and were designated as red-zone areas with no development or parking improvements to be recommended. The rest of the NNR is placed in the orange zone, for locations with fragile habitats but less tourism pressure.

The underlying geology of the North Norfolk coast is <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <a href="chalk">chalk</a>, exposed at <a href="Hunstanton">Hunstanton</a> cliffs just to the west of the SSSI, but buried by soft <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a> glacial debris for the entire length of the SSSI coast. Unlike the soft, rapidly eroding cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. However, this coastline is threatened by <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, with sea level rising an estimated 1–2 mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.

Half the area of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been reclaimed in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation. The <a href="Environment%20Agency">Environment Agency</a>'s management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness in the face of a potential sea level rise of 1.1 m (3 ft) by that date. The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3.5 m (10 ft) per year. This may affect the movement of <a href="sediment">sediment</a>, and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.

Master System

The is a <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28third%20generation%29">third-generation</a> <a href="home%20video%20game%20console">home video game console</a> manufactured by <a href="Sega">Sega</a>. It was originally a remodeled export version of the Sega Mark III, the third iteration of the <a href="SG-1000">SG-1000</a> series of consoles, which was released in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> in 1985 and featured enhanced graphical capabilities over its predecessors. The Master System launched in North America in 1986, followed by Europe in 1987, and Brazil in 1989. A Japanese version of the Master System was also launched in 1987, which has additional features over the Mark III and other regional variants of the console, namely a built-in <a href="Frequency%20modulation">FM audio</a> chip, a rapid-fire switch and a dedicated port for the 3D glasses. A cost-reduced model known as the Master System II was released in 1990 in North America and Europe.

The original Master System models uses both <a href="Game%20cartridge">cartridges</a> and a credit card-sized format known as <a href="Sega%20Card">Sega Card</a>s. Accessories for the consoles were also released such as a <a href="light%20gun">light gun</a> and 3D glasses designed to work with a range of specially coded games, which were sold separately or available in certain bundles. The later Master System II redesign removed the card slot, turning it into a strictly cartridge-only system and was incompatible with the 3D glasses by proxy.

The Master System was released in competition with the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (NES). It had fewer well-reviewed games than the NES, and a smaller library, due to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity. Despite the Master System's newer hardware, it failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. However, it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil. 

The Master System is estimated to have sold at 13 million units, excluding recent Brazil sales. Retrospective criticism has recognized its role in the development of the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a>, and a number of well-received games, particularly in <a href="PAL%20region">PAL region</a>s, but is critical of its limited library in the <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> regions, which were mainly dominated by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s NES. As of 2015, the Master System was still in production in Brazil by <a href="Tectoy">Tectoy</a>, making it the world's longest-lived console.

In the early 1980s, <a href="Sega">Sega Enterprises, Inc.</a>, then a subsidiary of the American conglomerate <a href="Gulf%20and%20Western%20Industries">Gulf and Western</a>, was one of the largest <a href="arcade%20game">arcade game</a> manufacturers active in the United States, with company revenues of $214 million by mid-1982. A downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 negatively impacted the company, leading Gulf and Western to sell the North American manufacturing and licensing of its arcade games to <a href="Bally%20Manufacturing">Bally Manufacturing</a>. The company retained its Japanese subsidiary, Sega Enterprises, Ltd., as well as Sega's North American research and development division. With its arcade business in decline, Sega Enterprises, Ltd. president <a href="Hayao%20Nakayama">Hayao Nakayama</a> advocated that the company leverage its hardware expertise to move into the home console market in Japan, which was in its infancy at the time. Nakayama received permission to proceed. The first model to be developed was the SC-3000, a computer with a built-in keyboard, but when Sega learned of Nintendo's plans to release a games-only console, they began developing the <a href="SG-1000">SG-1000</a> alongside the SC-3000.

The SG-1000 was first released in Japan on July 15, 1983, at a price of <a href="Japanese%20yen">JP¥</a>15,000. It was launched on the same day that <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> released the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Family Computer</a> (Famicom) in Japan. Shortly after the launch of the SG-1000, Gulf and Western began to divest itself of its non-core businesses after the death of company founder, <a href="Charles%20Bluhdorn">Charles Bluhdorn</a>, so Nakayama and former Sega CEO <a href="David%20Rosen%20%28business%29">David Rosen</a> arranged a management buyout of the Japanese subsidiary in 1984 with financial backing from <a href="CSK%20Holdings%20Corporation">CSK Corporation</a>, a prominent Japanese software company. Nakayama was then installed as CEO of the new Sega Enterprises, Ltd. Following the buyout, Sega released another console, the SG-1000 II, for ¥15,000. It featured a few hardware tweaks from the original model, including detachable controllers. The SG-1000 II did not sell well, however, leading to Sega's decision to continue work on the video game hardware used for the system. This resulted in the release of the Sega Mark III in Japan in 1985.

Engineered by the same internal Sega team that had created the SG-1000, the Mark III was a redesigned iteration of the previous console. The <a href="central%20processing%20units">CPU</a>s in the SG-1000 and SG-1000 II were <a href="Zilog%20Z80A">Zilog Z80A</a>s running at 3.58 <a href="megahertz">MHz</a>, while the Mark III, SC-3000—a <a href="Home%20computer">computer</a> version of the SG-1000—and Master System feature a Z80A running at 4 MHz. The Mark III and Master System also have a slot for <a href="Sega%20Card">Sega Card</a> software without any need for the Card Catcher add-on that the SC-3000 and previous SG-1000 consoles required. According to "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>", lessons from the SG-1000's lack of commercial success were used in the hardware redesign of the Mark III, and the console was designed to be more powerful than the Famicom.

For the console's North America release, Sega restyled and rebranded the Mark III under the name "Master System", similar to Nintendo's own reworking of the Famicom into the Nintendo Entertainment System. The "Master System" name was one of several proposals Sega's American employees considered, and was ultimately chosen by throwing darts against a whiteboard, although plans to release a cheaper console similarly referred to as the "Base System" also influenced the decision. Sega Enterprises Chairman <a href="Isao%20Okawa">Isao Okawa</a> endorsed the name after being told it was a reference to the competitive nature of both the video game industry and martial arts, in which only one competitor can be the "Master". The futuristic final design for the Master System was intended to appeal to Western tastes.

The Sega Mark III was released in Japan in October 1985 at a price of ¥15,000. Despite featuring technically more powerful hardware than its chief competition, the Famicom, the Mark III did not prove to be successful at its launch. Difficulties arose from Nintendo's licensing practices with third-party developers at the time, whereby Nintendo required that games for the Famicom not be published on other consoles. To overcome this, Sega developed its own games and obtained the rights to <a href="Porting">port</a> games from other developers, but they did not sell well. <a href="NEC">NEC</a> later used the same strategy on some of Sega's games when developing games for the <a href="TurboGrafx-16">TurboGrafx-16</a>. In preparation for the launch, <a href="Mark%20Cerny">Mark Cerny</a> has stated that "pressure was very, very high", with a typical game being allotted only three months of development time.

After being restyled the "Master System", the console was released in North America in 1986 at a price of US$200 (), including a <a href="multicart">multicart</a> of the games "<a href="Hang-On">Hang-On</a>" and "<a href="Safari%20Hunt">Safari Hunt</a>". Sega and Nintendo, which was similarly exporting the Famicom to the US as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), planned to spend $15 million in the fall and winter of 1986 to market their consoles; Sega hoped to sell 400,000 to 750,000 consoles in 1986. By the end of 1986, the Master System had sold 125,000 consoles, more than the <a href="Atari%207800">Atari 7800</a>'s 100,000 but less than Nintendo's 1.1 million. As in Japan, the Master System in North America had a limited game library that was not as well received as the NES. Against Nintendo's licensing practices, Sega only had two third-party American publishers, <a href="Activision">Activision</a> and <a href="Parker%20Brothers">Parker Brothers</a>. By 1988, Nintendo commanded 83 percent of the North American video game market share. Sega claimed that "our system is the first one where the <a href="box%20art">graphics on the box</a> are actually matched by the graphics of the game", and marketing for the Master System was targeted at bringing home the arcade experience, but its marketing department was run by only two men, giving Sega a disadvantage in advertising. At this time, Sega sold the distribution rights for the Master System in the United States to <a href="Tonka">Tonka</a>, which did not have any previous experience with electronic entertainment systems. Some of Tonka's decisions with the Master System included blocking <a href="Video%20game%20localization">localization</a> of several popular video games. Though the distributor of the console had changed, the Master System continued to perform poorly in the market. The console was re-released as the Master System in Japan in October 1987 for ¥16,800, but still sold poorly as did the Mark III. Neither model posed a serious challenge to Nintendo in Japan.

The European launch of the Master System occurred in 1987. It was distributed by <a href="Virgin%20Mastertronic">Mastertronic</a> in the United Kingdom, Master Games in France, and <a href="Ariolasoft">Ariolasoft</a> in Germany. Mastertronic advertised the Master System as "an arcade in the home" and launched the system at <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>99 (). Advance orders from retailers were high, but Sega proved unable to deliver inventory until <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a> on December 26, causing many retailers to cancel their orders. As a result, Master Games and Mastertronic both entered financial crises and Ariolasoft vowed never to work with Sega again. Mastertronic had already sold a minority interest to <a href="Richard%20Branson">Richard Branson</a> and the Virgin group to enter the console business and now sold the remainder of the company to avoid bankruptcy. The newly rebranded Virgin Mastertronic then took over all European distribution in 1988. Virgin Mastertronic consequently focused marketing the Master System on ports of Sega's arcade games and positioning it as a superior alternative to the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> and the <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> home computers in terms of video games. As a result of this marketing and of Nintendo's less effective approaches in Europe, the Master System began to attract European-based developers. The Master System held a significant part of the video game console market in Europe through the release of Sega's succeeding console, the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Mega Drive</a>. 

Brazil was also a successful market for the Master System, where the console was distributed by <a href="Tectoy">Tectoy</a>. Launched officially in Brazil in September 1989, the Master System achieved success in the region. By the end of 1990, the Master System install base in Brazil was about 280,000 units. The company also introduced a telephone service with tips for games, created a Master System club, and presented the program "Master Tips" during commercial breaks of the television show "Sessão Aventura" of <a href="Rede%20Globo">Rede Globo</a>. Sega's primary competition, <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, did not officially arrive in Brazil until 1993, and were unable to compete. Tectoy claimed 80% of the Brazilian video game market.

Sega released the Mega Drive, a <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> video game console, in Japan on October 29, 1988. The final licensed release for the Mark III/Master System in Japan was "<a href="Bomber%20Raid">Bomber Raid</a>" in 1989. During the same year, Sega was preparing to release the new Mega Drive, relabeled "Genesis", in North America. Displeased with Tonka's handling of the Master System, Sega reacquired the marketing and distribution rights to the Master System for the United States. In 1990, Sega released the remodeled Master System II, designed to be a lower-cost version of the console which also removed the Sega Card slot. Sega promoted the new model themselves, but the console still sold poorly in the region despite Tonka no longer being involved with the Master System's marketing. In 1991, Nintendo entered into a consent agreement under <a href="United%20States%20antitrust%20law">United States antitrust law</a> and was forced to abandon some of its licensing practices. By early 1992, Master System production ceased in North America. By the time of its discontinuation, Master System had sold between 1.5 million and 2 million units in the United States, finishing behind both Nintendo and <a href="Atari">Atari</a>, which controlled 80 percent and 12 percent of the market, respectively. The last licensed release in North America was "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%288-bit%20video%20game%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" in 1991.

Contrary to its performance in Japan and North America, the Master System was eventually a success in Europe, where it outsold the NES by a considerable margin. As late as 1993, the Master System's active <a href="Installed%20base">installed user base</a> in Europe was 6.25 million units, larger than that of the Mega Drive's 5.73 million base that year. Combined with the Mega Drive, Sega represented the majority of the console user base in Europe that year. The Master System's largest markets in the region were France and the United Kingdom, which had active user bases of 1.6 million and 1.35 million, respectively, in 1993. The remodeled Master System II also proved to be successful and helped Sega to sustain the Master System's significant market share in Europe. More new releases would continue into the 1990s in Europe, including "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%202%20%288-bit%20video%20game%29">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>", "<a href="Streets%20of%20Rage%202">Streets of Rage 2</a>", and "<a href="Mercs">Mercs</a>". 

The Master System has had continued success in Brazil, where new variations have continued to be released, long after the console was discontinued elsewhere. As they are from the original 1989 manufacturer, Tectoy, this has resulted in the console's unusually long production lifespan. These variations include the Master System Compact and the Master System 3, though Tectoy has also received requests to remake the original Master System. In 2015, it was reported that the Master System sells around 150,000 units per year in Brazil, a level that holds its own against modern systems such as the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>. By 2016, the Master System had sold 8 million units in Brazil. Because Tectoy continued to produce the Master System years after its cancellation, the console is considered the longest-lived in the <a href="History%20of%20video%20games">history of video game consoles</a>.

Developed under the name "Project Mercury" and designed based on the Master System's hardware, the Game Gear is a <a href="handheld%20game%20console">handheld game console</a>. It was first released in Japan on October 6, 1990, in North America and Europe in 1991, and in Australia and New Zealand in 1992. Originally retailing at JP¥19,800 in Japan, US$149.99 in North America, and GB£99.99 in Europe, the Game Gear was designed to compete with the <a href="Game%20Boy">Game Boy</a>, which <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> had released in 1989. Despite the similarities the Game Gear shared with the Master System, the games of the latter were not directly playable on the handheld, and were only able to be played on the handheld by the use of an accessory called the Master System Converter. A large part of the Game Gear's game library consists of Master System ports. Because of the landscape orientation of the Game Gear's screen and the similarities in hardware between the handheld console and the Master System, it was easy for developers to port Master System games to the handheld. In particular, many Master System ports of Game Gear games were done by Tectoy for the Brazilian market, as the Master System was more popular than the Game Gear in the region.

The main CPU of the Master System is a Zilog Z80A, an <a href="8-bit">8-bit</a> processor running at 4 MHz. It has 8 <a href="kilobyte">kB</a> of <a href="read-only%20memory">ROM</a>, 8 kB of <a href="random%20access%20memory">RAM</a> and 16 kB of video RAM. Video is provided through an <a href="RF%20switch">RF switch</a> and displays at a resolution of 256 × 192 pixels and up to 32 colors at one time from a total palette of 64 colors. Physically, the Master System measures , while the Mark III measures . Both the Mark III and the Master System possess two slots for game input: one for Mega Cartridges and one for <a href="Sega%20Card">Sega Card</a>s, along with an expansion slot and 2 controller ports. Sound is provided by the <a href="SN76489">SN76489</a> <a href="Programmable%20sound%20generator">PSG</a> chip. The Japanese version also integrates the <a href="YM2413">YM2413</a> <a href="Frequency%20modulation%20synthesis">FM</a> chip, which had been an optional feature on the Mark III. With few exceptions, Master System hardware is identical to the hardware in the Mark III. Games for the console are playable on the Sega Genesis by use of an accessory known as the Power Base Converter, as well as on the Game Gear by use of the Master System Converter. In comparison to Nintendo's NES, the Master System was designed with superior hardware. It contains twice as much memory as its competitor, and its CPU runs at a faster clock rate.

A number of accessories were created for the Mark III and Master System, which are cross-compatible with one another. The controller for each console consists of a rectangular shape with a control pad and two buttons. Sega also introduced additional controllers, such as a bike handle controller and paddle controller, for the Mark III and a special sports controller for the Master System. A pair of <a href="Active%20shutter%203D%20system">3D glasses</a> known as SegaScope 3-D were also created for games such as "<a href="Space%20Harrier%203-D">Space Harrier 3D</a>", although Mark III users need an additional converter to use them. The Mark III also had an optional RF transmitter accessory, allowing wireless play that broadcast the game being played on a <a href="UHF">UHF</a> television signal. A <a href="light%20gun">light gun</a> peripheral known as the Light Phaser was also released. Its design was based on the weapon of the same name from the Japanese anime "<a href="Zillion%20%28anime%29">Zillion</a>".

The Master System was produced in several variations. Released in 1990, the Master System II removed a number of components in order to reduce the cost of the console, including the Sega Card slot, reset button, power light, expansion port, and activation music and logo upon turning on the system. Several licensed variations of the console also exist in Brazil, created by Tectoy. A variation known as the Master System 3 Compact was capable of functioning wirelessly with an RF transmitter, while Tectoy also sought to appeal to female gamers in Brazil with the Master System Girl, which was molded in bright pink plastic. A more recent version, released in 2006 in Brazil known as the Master System 3 Collection, contains 120 built-in games. Another Master System, built as a <a href="handheld%20game%20console">handheld game console</a>, was released under several brands including <a href="Coleco">Coleco</a> in 2006.

Games for the Master System are in two formats: <a href="ROM%20cartridge">ROM cartridge</a>s are capable of holding up to 4 <a href="megabit">Mbit</a> of game code, while <a href="Sega%20Card">Sega Card</a>s (My Cards in Japan) can hold up to 256 kbit. Cards were cheaper to manufacture than the cartridges and included games such as "<a href="Spy%20vs.%20Spy%20%281984%20video%20game%29">Spy vs. Spy</a>" and "Super Tennis", but Sega Cards were eventually dropped due to their lack of memory. Master System cartridges were initially branded Mega Cartridges to emphasize their large ROM size compared with cards, but this label fell into disuse after Sega ceased production of new card software. Games manufactured for the system include "<a href="Psycho%20Fox">Psycho Fox</a>", "<a href="Golvellius">Golvellius</a>", and "<a href="Phantasy%20Star%20%28video%20game%29">Phantasy Star</a>", which became a successful franchise for Sega and is considered one of the benchmark <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a>s. The Master System also hosted games featuring Sega's flagship character at the time, <a href="Alex%20Kidd">Alex Kidd</a>, including "<a href="Alex%20Kidd%20in%20Miracle%20World">Alex Kidd in Miracle World</a>". "" has garnered recognition as "a genuine milestone in video game design" due to its innovative blend of platforming gameplay with RPG elements. Built-in games are common in Master System hardware, including "<a href="Snail%20Maze">Snail Maze</a>" and "Hang-On", as well as "Alex Kidd in Miracle World" and "Sonic the Hedgehog". Additional games were released in Brazil by Tectoy, including ports of "<a href="Street%20Fighter%20II">Street Fighter II</a>" and "<a href="Dynamite%20Headdy">Dynamite Headdy</a>" after the Master System was discontinued elsewhere.

Due to Nintendo's licensing practices, few third-party developers contributed games for the Master System. According to Damien McFerran, "Nintendo requested that developers keep their games 'NES exclusive', and given the unassailable position the console enjoyed, few had the will to defy this request." In addition, according to game designer <a href="Mark%20Cerny">Mark Cerny</a>, most of Sega's early Master System games were developed within a strict three-month deadline, which negatively impacted game quality. "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" compared new Sega games to "drops of water in the desert". Games for the Master System, however, did take advantage of the advanced hardware of the console in comparison to the NES; "Alex Kidd in Miracle World", for example, showcases "blistering colors and more detailed sprites" than competing NES games. In addition, the Master System version of "<a href="R-Type">R-Type</a>" has garnered retrospective praise for its quality, with its visuals considered comparable to those found in the TurboGrafx-16 port of the same game.

"<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" praised the system's <a href="PAL%20region">PAL</a> library, referring to it as a "superb library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives" which offered significantly greater depth than what was available in North America and provided a "drip-feed of quality titles" that continued to be released in Europe up until the mid-1990s. Such games ranged from 8-bit entries of Sega Genesis/Mega Drive franchises such as "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%288-bit%20video%20game%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" and "<a href="Streets%20of%20Rage">Streets of Rage</a>" to dozens of exclusive PAL releases such as "<a href="Lucky%20Dime%20Caper">Lucky Dime Caper</a>", "<a href="Asterix%20%281991%20video%20game%29">Asterix</a>", "<a href="Ninja%20Gaiden%20%28Master%20System%20video%20game%29">Ninja Gaiden</a>", "<a href="Master%20of%20Darkness">Master of Darkness</a>" and "<a href="Power%20Strike%20II">Power Strike II</a>".

The Sega Mark III, as well as the Japanese model of the Master System, both have full backwards compatibility with SC-3000/SG-1000 game cartridges (Sega's previous family of 8-bit platforms) and both can also play Sega My Card games without the need of the Card Catcher add-on. However, educational and programming cartridges for the SC-3000 require the SK-1100 keyboard peripheral, which is compatible with the Mark III, but not with the Japanese Master System. Mark III-specific games were initially available in My Card format (labelled My Card Mark III to distinguish themselves from standard My Card games designed for the SC-3000/SG-1000), starting with "<a href="Teddy%20Boy%20Blues">Teddy Boy Blues</a>" and "<a href="Hang-On">Hang-On</a>", both released on October 20, 1985. Mark III-specific cartridges were eventually made starting with "<a href="Fantasy%20Zone">Fantasy Zone</a>", released on June 15, 1986. Every Mark III/Master System cartridge in Japan (along with the SC-3000/SG-1000-compatible title "Portrait of Loretta") were released under the Gold Cartridge branding, with the exception of "<a href="Rygar%20%28video%20game%29">Argus no Jūjiken</a>" (a rebranded port of "Rygar") and "<a href="Solomon%27s%20Key">Solomon's Key</a>". These two exceptions were published under a "Silver Cartridge" branding, as they were released by Salio, a short-lived subsidiary of <a href="Tecmo">Tecmo</a> that was also the only third party company to ever published Mark III/Master System games in Japan. The Gold and Silver branding actually referred to the color of the boxes that the cartridges were packaged in, and not the actual cartridges themselves, which were initially produced in white casing just like the Mark III console itself, but switched to black casing by the end of 1987 in order to match the Master System redesign (with the packaging and labeling of these later cartridges mentioning compatibility with both versions of the console). The final Mark III/Master System game published by Sega in Japan was
"<a href="Bomber%20Raid">Bomber Raid</a>", released on February 4, 1989, just a few months after the launch of the Mega Drive.

Sales of the Master System have been estimated at 13 million units, not including recent Brazil sales. The console saw much more continued success in Europe and Brazil than it did in Japan and North America. In 1989, the Sega Master System was listed in the top 20 products of <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>'s Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service. However, the "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" 1992 Buyer's Guide indicated a souring interest in the console. Four reviewers scored the console 5, 4, 5, and 5 out of a possible 10 points each, focusing on the better value of the Genesis and lack of quality games for the Master System. In 1993, reviewers scored the console 2, 2, 3, and 3 out of 10, noting its abandonment by Sega in North America and lack of new releases. By contrast, Nintendo's NES console sold 62 million units, outselling the Master System several times over. According to Bill Pearse of "Playthings", the NES gained an advantage over the Master System through the use of better software and stronger character identification. Sega would close the market share gap between itself and Nintendo in the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fourth%20generation%29">next generation</a> with the release of the Genesis, which sold 30.75 million consoles compared with the 49 million <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> consoles sold by Nintendo.

Retrospective feedback of the console praises its support toward development of the Sega Genesis, but is generally critical of its small game library. Writing for <a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>, Dave Beuscher notes that "it was doomed by the lack of third party software support and all but disappeared from the American market by 1992." On the other hand, "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" praised the system's PAL library as a "superb library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives", noting that it was significantly larger than its North American library. Damien McFerran of "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" recognizes its value to the future success of the Genesis, stating, "Without this criminally undervalued machine, Sega would not have enjoyed the considerable success it had with the Mega Drive. The Master System allowed Sega to experiment with arcade conversions, original <a href="intellectual%20property">IP</a> and even create a mascot in the form of the lovable monkey-boy Alex Kidd." In 2009, the Master System was named the 20th best video game console of all time by the video gaming website <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, behind both of its main competitors, the <a href="Atari%207800">Atari 7800</a> (ranked 17th best) and the Nintendo Entertainment System (1st). IGN cited the Master System's small games library in the NTSC regions, coupled with the highly uneven quality of the few games that were released, as the console's major issues, stating, "Months could go by between major releases and that made a dud on the Master System feel even more painful."

The Master System and its software still retains some popularity. According to IGN, "Despite its narrow mass audience, the Master System had—and still has—a very loyal fan base." In 2005, Sega reached a deal with Chinese company AtGames to release Master System software in the form of emulation products in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. A number of Master System games were released for download on <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="Wii">Wii</a> <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> in North America, PAL territories and Japan. The first game released for this service was "<a href="Black%20Belt%20%28video%20game%29">Fist of the North Star</a>", on February 26, 2008. "<a href="Fantasy%20Zone">Fantasy Zone</a>" followed on March 11. Both were released in Japan. In North America, "<a href="Wonder%20Boy%20%28video%20game%29">Wonder Boy</a>" was the first Master System game released for the service on March 31, 2008. Master System games have also been released via the <a href="GameTap">GameTap</a> online service.

George B. McClellan

George Brinton McClellan (December 3, 1826October 29, 1885) was an American soldier, civil engineer, railroad executive, and politician. A graduate of <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">West Point</a>, McClellan served with distinction during the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican War</a> and later left the Army to work in railroads until the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> Early in the war, McClellan was appointed to the rank of <a href="major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">major general</a> and played an important role in raising a well-trained and organized army, which would become the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> in the <a href="Eastern%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Eastern Theater</a>; he served a brief period (November 1861 to March 1862) as <a href="Commanding%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">general-in-chief</a> of the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>. Although McClellan was meticulous in his planning and preparations, these very characteristics hampered his ability to challenge aggressive opponents in a fast-moving battlefield environment. He chronically overestimated the strength of enemy units and was reluctant to apply principles of mass, frequently leaving large portions of his army unengaged at decisive points.

McClellan organized and led the Union army in the <a href="Peninsula%20Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a> in southeastern <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> from March through July 1862. It was the first large-scale offensive in the <a href="Eastern%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Eastern Theater</a>. Making an amphibious clockwise turning movement around the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate Army</a> in northern Virginia, McClellan's forces turned west to move up the Virginia Peninsula, between the <a href="James%20River%20%28Virginia%29">James</a> and <a href="York%20River%20%28Virginia%29">York Rivers</a>, landing from the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, with the Confederate capital, <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>, as their objective. Initially, McClellan was somewhat successful against the equally cautious General <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a>, but the emergence of General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> to command the <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> turned the subsequent <a href="Seven%20Days%20Battles">Seven Days Battles</a> into a partial Union defeat.

General McClellan failed to maintain the trust of <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. He did not trust his <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> and was privately derisive of him. He was removed from command in November after failing to decisively pursue Lee's Army following the tactically inconclusive but strategic Union victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a> outside <a href="Sharpsburg%2C%20Maryland">Sharpsburg, Maryland</a>, and never received another field command. McClellan went on to become the unsuccessful <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> nominee in the <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">1864 presidential election</a> against Lincoln's reelection. The effectiveness of his campaign was damaged when he repudiated his party's platform, which promised an end to the war and negotiations with the southern Confederacy. He served as the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20New%20Jersey">24th</a> <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20Jersey">Governor</a> of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> from 1878 to 1881, and eventually became a writer, and vigorously defended his Civil War conduct.

Most modern authorities have assessed McClellan as a poor battlefield general. Some historians view him as a highly capable commander whose reputation suffered unfairly at the hands of pro-Lincoln partisans who made him a <a href="scapegoat">scapegoat</a> for the Union's military setbacks. After the war, subsequent commanding general and 18th President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> was asked for his opinion of McClellan as a general; he replied, "McClellan is to me one of the mysteries of the war."

George Brinton McClellan was born in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, the son of a prominent surgeon, Dr. <a href="George%20McClellan%20%28physician%29">George McClellan</a>, the founder of <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson%20University">Jefferson Medical College</a>. His father's family was of <a href="Ulster%20Scots%20people">Scottish</a> heritage. His mother was Elizabeth Sophia Steinmetz Brinton McClellan (1800–1889), daughter of a leading Pennsylvania family, a woman noted for her "considerable grace and refinement". The couple had five children: a daughter, Frederica; then three sons, John, George, and Arthur; and finally a second daughter, Mary. McClellan was the great-grandson of <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a> general <a href="Samuel%20McClellan">Samuel McClellan</a> of <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Connecticut">Woodstock, Connecticut</a>.

McClellan attended the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> in 1840 at age twelve, resigning himself to the study of law. After two years, he changed his goal to military service. With the assistance of his father's letter to <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a>, young George was accepted at the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> in 1842, the academy having waived its normal minimum age of sixteen.

At West Point, he was an energetic and ambitious cadet, deeply interested in the teachings of <a href="Dennis%20Hart%20Mahan">Dennis Hart Mahan</a> and the theoretical strategic principles of <a href="Antoine-Henri%20Jomini">Antoine-Henri Jomini</a>. His closest friends were aristocratic Southerners such as James Stuart, <a href="Dabney%20Maury">Dabney Maury</a>, <a href="Cadmus%20Wilcox">Cadmus Wilcox</a>, and <a href="A.%20P.%20Hill">A. P. Hill</a>. These associations gave McClellan what he considered to be an appreciation of the Southern mind and an understanding of the political and military implications of the sectional differences in the United States that led to the Civil War. He graduated at age nineteen in 1846, second in his class of 59 cadets, losing the top position to <a href="Charles%20Seaforth%20Stewart">Charles Seaforth Stewart</a> only because of poor drawing skills. He was commissioned a <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> <a href="Second%20Lieutenant%23United%20States">second lieutenant</a> in the U.S. Army <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Corps of Engineers</a>.

McClellan's first assignment was with a company of engineers formed at West Point, but he quickly received orders to sail for the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican War</a>. He arrived near the mouth of the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a> in October 1846, well prepared for action with a double-barreled shotgun, two pistols, a saber, a dress sword, and a <a href="Bowie%20knife">Bowie knife</a>. He complained that he had arrived too late to take any part in the American victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Monterrey">Monterrey</a> in September. During a temporary armistice in which the forces of Gen. <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> awaited action, McClellan was stricken with <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> and <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, which kept him in the hospital for nearly a month. The malaria would recur in later years—he called it his "Mexican disease". He served as an engineering officer during the war, was frequently subject to enemy fire, and was appointed a brevet <a href="First%20Lieutenant%23United%20States">first lieutenant</a> for his services at <a href="Battle%20of%20Contreras">Contreras</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Churubusco">Churubusco</a> and to <a href="Captain%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">captain</a> for his service at <a href="Battle%20of%20Chapultepec">Chapultepec</a>. He performed reconnaissance missions for <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>, a close friend of McClellan's father.

McClellan's experiences in the war would shape his military and political life. He learned that flanking movements (used by Scott at <a href="Battle%20of%20Cerro%20Gordo">Cerro Gordo</a>) are often better than frontal assaults, and the value of siege operations (<a href="Siege%20of%20Veracruz">Veracruz</a>). He witnessed Scott's success in balancing political with military affairs, and his good relations with the civil population as he invaded, enforcing strict discipline on his soldiers to minimize damage to property. McClellan also developed a disdain for volunteer soldiers and officers, particularly politicians who cared nothing for discipline and training.

McClellan returned to West Point to command his engineering company, which was attached to the academy for the purpose of training cadets in engineering activities. He chafed at the boredom of peacetime garrison service, although he greatly enjoyed the social life. In June 1851, he was ordered to <a href="Fort%20Delaware">Fort Delaware</a>, a masonry work under construction on an island in the <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware River</a>, downriver from Philadelphia. In March 1852, he was ordered to report to Capt. <a href="Randolph%20B.%20Marcy">Randolph B. Marcy</a> at <a href="Fort%20Smith%2C%20Arkansas">Fort Smith</a>, <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, to serve as second-in-command on an expedition to discover the sources of the <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20South">Red River</a>. By June the expedition reached the source of the north fork of the river and Marcy named a small tributary McClellan's Creek. Upon their return to civilization on July 28, they were astonished to find that they had been given up for dead. A sensational story had reached the press that the expedition had been ambushed by 2,000 <a href="Comanche">Comanche</a>s and killed to the last man. McClellan blamed the story on "a set of scoundrels, who seek to keep up agitation on the frontier in order to get employment from the Govt. in one way or other".

In the fall of 1852, McClellan published a manual on bayonet tactics that he had translated from the original French. He also received an assignment to the Department of Texas, with orders to perform a survey of Texas rivers and harbors. In 1853 he participated in the <a href="Pacific%20Railroad%20survey">Pacific Railroad survey</a>s, ordered by <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, to select an appropriate route for the planned <a href="First%20Transcontinental%20Railroad">transcontinental railroad</a>. McClellan surveyed the western portion of the northern corridor along the 47th and 49th parallels from <a href="St.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">St. Paul</a> to the <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a>. In doing so, he demonstrated a tendency for insubordination toward senior political figures. <a href="Isaac%20Stevens">Isaac Stevens</a>, governor of the <a href="Washington%20Territory">Washington Territory</a>, became dissatisfied with McClellan's performance in his scouting of passes across the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>.

McClellan selected Yakima Pass () without a thorough reconnaissance and refused the governor's order to lead a party through it in winter conditions, relying on faulty intelligence about the depth of snow pack in that area. In so doing, he missed three greatly superior passes in the near vicinity, which were eventually used for railroads and interstate highways. The governor ordered McClellan to turn over his expedition logbooks, but McClellan steadfastly refused, most likely because of embarrassing personal comments that he had made throughout his adventures.

Returning to the East, McClellan began courting his future wife, Mary Ellen Marcy (1836–1915), the daughter of his former commander. Ellen, or Nelly, refused McClellan's first proposal of marriage, one of nine that she received from a variety of suitors, including his West Point friend, A. P. Hill. Ellen accepted Hill's proposal in 1856, but her family did not approve and he withdrew.

In June 1854, McClellan was sent on a secret reconnaissance mission to Santo Domingo at the behest of Jefferson Davis. McClellan assessed local defensive capabilities for the secretary. (The information was not used until 1870, when President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> unsuccessfully attempted to annex the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a>.) Davis was beginning to treat McClellan almost as a protégé, and his next assignment was to assess the logistical readiness of various railroads in the United States, once again with an eye toward planning for the transcontinental railroad. In March 1855, McClellan was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment.

Because of his political connections and his mastery of French, McClellan received the assignment to be an official observer of the European armies in the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> in 1855. Traveling widely, and interacting with the highest military commands and royal families, McClellan observed the <a href="Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281854%E2%80%931855%29">siege of Sevastopol</a>. Upon his return to the United States in 1856 he requested assignment in Philadelphia to prepare his report, which contained a critical analysis of the siege and a lengthy description of the organization of the European armies. He also wrote a manual on <a href="cavalry%20tactics">cavalry tactics</a> that was based on Russian cavalry regulations. Like other observers, though, McClellan did not appreciate the importance of the emergence of <a href="rifled%20musket">rifled musket</a>s in the Crimean War, and the fundamental changes in warfare tactics it would require.

The Army adopted McClellan's cavalry manual and also his design for a <a href="saddle">saddle</a>, dubbed the <a href="McClellan%20Saddle">McClellan Saddle</a>, which he claimed to have seen used by <a href="Hussar">Hussar</a>s in <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> and Hungary. It became standard issue for as long as the U.S. horse cavalry existed and is still used for ceremonies.

McClellan resigned his commission January 16, 1857, and, capitalizing on his experience with railroad assessment, became chief engineer and vice president of the <a href="Illinois%20Central%20Railroad">Illinois Central Railroad</a>, and then president of the <a href="Ohio%20and%20Mississippi%20Railroad">Ohio and Mississippi Railroad</a> in 1860. He performed well in both jobs, expanding the Illinois Central toward <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans</a> and helping the Ohio and Mississippi recover from the <a href="Panic%20of%201857">Panic of 1857</a>. Despite his successes and lucrative salary ($10,000 per year), he was frustrated with civilian employment and continued to study classical military strategy assiduously. During the <a href="Utah%20War">Utah War</a> against the <a href="Mormons">Mormons</a>, he considered rejoining the Army. He also considered service as a <a href="Filibuster%20%28military%29">filibuster</a> in support of <a href="Benito%20Ju%C3%A1rez">Benito Juárez</a> in Mexico.

Before the outbreak of the Civil War, McClellan became active in politics, supporting the presidential campaign of <a href="United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democrat</a> <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">1860 election</a>. He claimed to have defeated an attempt at vote fraud by <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> by ordering the delay of a train that was carrying men to vote illegally in another county, enabling Douglas to win the county.

In October 1859 McClellan was able to resume his courtship of Mary Ellen, and they were married in <a href="Calvary%20Church%20%28Manhattan%29">Calvary Church</a>, New York City, on May 22, 1860.

At the start of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, McClellan's knowledge of what was called "big war science" and his railroad experience suggested he might excel at military logistics. This placed him in great demand as the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> mobilized. The governors of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, the three largest states of the Union, actively pursued him to command their states' militia. Ohio Governor <a href="William%20Dennison%20%28Ohio%20governor%29">William Dennison</a> was the most persistent, so McClellan was commissioned a <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">major general</a> of volunteers and took command of the Ohio militia on April 23, 1861. Unlike some of his fellow Union officers who came from <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> families, he was opposed to federal interference with slavery. For this reason, some of his Southern colleagues approached him informally about siding with the Confederacy, but he could not accept the concept of <a href="secession">secession</a>.

On May 3 McClellan re-entered federal service as commander of the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Ohio">Department of the Ohio</a>, responsible for the defense of the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and, later, western Pennsylvania, western Virginia, and Missouri. On May 14, he was commissioned a major general in the regular army. At age 34, he outranked everyone in the Army except Lt. Gen. <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>, the general-in-chief. McClellan's rapid promotion was partly due to his acquaintance with <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> and former Ohio governor and senator.

As McClellan scrambled to process the thousands of men who were volunteering for service and to set up training camps, he also applied his mind to grand strategy. He wrote a letter to Gen. Scott on April 27, four days after assuming command in Ohio, that presented the first proposal for a strategy for the war. It contained two alternatives, each envisioning a prominent role for himself as commander. The first would use 80,000 men to invade Virginia through the <a href="Kanawha%20River">Kanawha Valley</a> toward <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>. The second would use the same force to drive south instead, crossing the Ohio River into Kentucky and Tennessee. Scott rejected both plans as logistically unfeasible. Although he complimented McClellan and expressed his "great confidence in your intelligence, zeal, science, and energy", he replied by letter that the 80,000 men would be better used on a river-based expedition to control the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> and split the Confederacy, accompanied by a strong <a href="Union%20blockade">Union blockade</a> of Southern ports. This plan, which would require considerable patience of the Northern public, was derided in newspapers as the <a href="Anaconda%20Plan">Anaconda Plan</a>, but eventually proved to be the outline of the successful prosecution of the war. Relations between the two generals became increasingly strained over the summer and fall.

McClellan's first military operations were to occupy the area of western <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> that wanted to remain in the Union and subsequently became the state of <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>. He had received intelligence reports on May 26 that the critical <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> bridges in that portion of the state were being burned. As he quickly implemented plans to invade the region, he triggered his first serious political controversy by proclaiming to the citizens there that his forces had no intentions of interfering with personal property—including slaves. "Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce you to believe that our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one thing clearly—not only will we abstain from all such interference but we will on the contrary with an iron hand, crush any attempted insurrection on their part." He quickly realized that he had overstepped his bounds and apologized by letter to President Lincoln. The controversy was not that his proclamation was diametrically opposed to the administration's policy at the time, but that he was so bold in stepping beyond his strictly military role.

His forces moved rapidly into the area through <a href="Grafton%2C%20West%20Virginia">Grafton</a> and were victorious at the tiny skirmish called the <a href="Battle%20of%20Philippi%20%28West%20Virginia%29">Battle of Philippi</a>, arguably the first land conflict of the war. His first personal command in battle was at <a href="Battle%20of%20Rich%20Mountain">Rich Mountain</a>, which he also won, but only after displaying a strong sense of caution and a reluctance to commit reserve forces that would be his hallmark for the rest of his career. His subordinate commander, <a href="William%20S.%20Rosecrans">William S. Rosecrans</a>, bitterly complained that his attack was not reinforced as McClellan had agreed. Nevertheless, these two minor victories propelled McClellan to the status of national hero. The "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>" entitled an article about him "Gen. McClellan, the Napoleon of the Present War".

After the defeat of the Union forces at <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Bull Run</a> on July 21, 1861, Lincoln summoned McClellan from western Virginia, where McClellan had given the North the only engagements bearing a semblance of victory. He traveled by special train on the main Pennsylvania line from <a href="Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia">Wheeling</a> through <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a>, and <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore</a>, and on to <a href="Washington%20City">Washington City</a>, and was greeted by enthusiastic crowds that met his train along the way.

<a href="Carl%20Sandburg">Carl Sandburg</a> wrote, "McClellan was the man of the hour, pointed to by events, and chosen by an overwhelming weight of public and private opinion." On July 26, the day he reached the capital, McClellan was appointed commander of the Military Division of the Potomac, the main Union force responsible for the defense of Washington. On August 20, several military units in Virginia were consolidated into his department and he immediately formed the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>, with himself as its first commander. He reveled in his newly acquired power and influence:

During the summer and fall, McClellan brought a high degree of organization to his new army, and greatly improved its morale with frequent trips to review and encourage his units. It was a remarkable achievement, in which he came to personify the Army of the Potomac and reaped the adulation of his men. He created defenses for Washington that were almost impregnable, consisting of 48 forts and strong points, with 480 guns manned by 7,200 artillerists. The Army of the Potomac grew in number from 50,000 in July to 168,000 in November, becoming the largest military force the United States had raised until that time. But this was also a time of tension in the high command, as he continued to quarrel frequently with the government and the general-in-chief, Lt. Gen. Scott, on matters of strategy. McClellan rejected the tenets of Scott's <a href="Anaconda%20Plan">Anaconda Plan</a>, favoring instead an overwhelming grand battle, in the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic</a> style. He proposed that his army should be expanded to 273,000 men and 600 guns and "crush the rebels in one campaign". He favored a war that would impose little impact on civilian populations and require no emancipation of slaves.

McClellan's antipathy to emancipation added to the pressure on him, as he received bitter criticism from <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radical Republicans</a> in the government. He viewed slavery as an institution recognized in the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>, and entitled to federal protection wherever it existed (Lincoln held the same public position until August 1862). McClellan's writings after the war were typical of many Northerners: "I confess to a prejudice in favor of my own race, & can't learn to like the odor of either Billy goats or niggers." But in November 1861, he wrote to his wife, "I will, if successful, throw my sword onto the scale to force an improvement in the condition of those poor blacks." He later wrote that had it been his place to arrange the terms of peace, he would have insisted on gradual emancipation, guarding the rights of both slaves and masters, as part of any settlement. But he made no secret of his opposition to the radical Republicans. He told Ellen, "I will not fight for the abolitionists." This put him in opposition with officials of the administration who believed he was attempting to implement the policies of the opposition party.

The immediate problem with McClellan's war strategy was that he was convinced the Confederates were ready to attack him with overwhelming numbers. On August 8, believing that the Confederacy had over 100,000 troops facing him (in contrast to the 35,000 they had actually deployed at Bull Run a few weeks earlier), he declared a state of emergency in the capital. By August 19, he estimated 150,000 rebel soldiers on his front. McClellan's subsequent campaigns were strongly influenced by the overblown enemy strength estimates of his secret service chief, detective <a href="Allan%20Pinkerton">Allan Pinkerton</a>, but in August 1861, these estimates were entirely McClellan's own. The result was a level of extreme caution that sapped the initiative of McClellan's army and dismayed the government. Historian and biographer <a href="Stephen%20W.%20Sears">Stephen W. Sears</a> observed that McClellan's actions would have been "essentially sound" for a commander who was as outnumbered as McClellan thought he was, but McClellan in fact rarely had less than a two-to-one advantage over the armies that opposed him in 1861 and 1862. That fall, for example, Confederate forces ranged from 35,000 to 60,000, whereas the Army of the Potomac in September numbered 122,000 men; in early December 170,000; by year end, 192,000.

The dispute with Scott became increasingly personal. Scott (as well as many in the War Department) was outraged that McClellan refused to divulge any details about his strategic planning, or even such basic information as the strengths and dispositions of his units. McClellan claimed he could not trust anyone in the administration to keep his plans secret from the press, and thus the enemy. In the course of a disagreement about defensive forces on the Potomac River, McClellan wrote to his wife on August 10: "Genl Scott is the great obstacle—he will not comprehend the danger & is either a traitor, or an incompetent. I have to fight my way against him." Scott became so disillusioned with the young general that he offered his resignation to President Lincoln, who initially refused to accept it. Rumors traveled through the capital that McClellan might resign, or instigate a military coup, if Scott were not removed. Lincoln's Cabinet met on October 18 and agreed to accept Scott's resignation for "reasons of health".

However, the subsequently formed <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> had high morale and was extremely proud of their general, some even referring to McClellan as the saviour of Washington. He prevented the army's morale from collapsing at least twice, in the aftermath of the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second</a> Battles of Bull Run. Many historians argue that he was talented in this aspect.

On November 1, 1861, <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> retired and McClellan became general-in-chief of all the Union armies. The president expressed his concern about the "vast labor" involved in the dual role of army commander and general-in-chief, but McClellan responded, "I can do it all."

Lincoln, as well as many other leaders and citizens of the northern states, became increasingly impatient with McClellan's slowness to attack the Confederate forces still massed near Washington. The Union defeat at the minor <a href="Battle%20of%20Ball%27s%20Bluff">Battle of Ball's Bluff</a> near <a href="Leesburg%2C%20Virginia">Leesburg</a> in October added to the frustration and indirectly damaged McClellan. In December, the Congress formed a <a href="United%20States%20Congress%20Joint%20Committee%20on%20the%20Conduct%20of%20the%20War">Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War</a>, which became a thorn in the side of many generals throughout the war, accusing them of incompetence and, in some cases, treason. McClellan was called as the first witness on December 23, but he contracted <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a> and could not attend. Instead, his subordinate officers testified, and their candid admissions that they had no knowledge of specific strategies for advancing against the Confederates raised many calls for McClellan's dismissal.

McClellan further damaged his reputation by his insulting insubordination to his commander-in-chief. He privately referred to Lincoln, whom he had known before the war as a lawyer for the Illinois Central, as "nothing more than a well-meaning baboon", a "gorilla", and "ever unworthy of ... his high position". On November 13, he snubbed the president, who had come to visit McClellan's house, by making him wait for 30 minutes, only to be told that the general had gone to bed and could not receive him.

On January 10, Lincoln met with top generals (McClellan did not attend) and directed them to formulate a plan of attack, expressing his exasperation with General McClellan with the following remark: "If General McClellan does not want to use the army, I would like to borrow it for a time." On January 12, 1862, McClellan was summoned to the White House, where the Cabinet demanded to hear his war plans. For the first time, he revealed his intentions to transport the Army of the Potomac by ship to <a href="Urbanna%2C%20Virginia">Urbanna</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, on the <a href="Rappahannock%20River">Rappahannock River</a>, outflanking the Confederate forces near Washington, and proceeding overland to capture Richmond. He refused to give any specific details of the proposed campaign, even to his friend, newly appointed <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">War Secretary</a> <a href="Edwin%20M.%20Stanton">Edwin M. Stanton</a>. On January 27, Lincoln issued an order that required all of his armies to begin offensive operations by February 22, <a href="Presidents%27%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Washington's birthday</a>. On January 31, he issued a supplementary order for the Army of the Potomac to move overland to attack the Confederates at <a href="Manassas%2C%20Virginia">Manassas Junction</a> and <a href="Centreville%2C%20Virginia">Centreville</a>. McClellan immediately replied with a 22-page letter objecting in detail to the president's plan and advocating instead his Urbanna plan, which was the first written instance of the plan's details being presented to the president. Although Lincoln believed his plan was superior, he was relieved that McClellan finally agreed to begin moving, and reluctantly approved. On March 8, doubting McClellan's resolve, Lincoln again interfered with the army commander's prerogatives. He called a <a href="council%20of%20war">council of war</a> at the White House in which McClellan's subordinates were asked about their confidence in the Urbanna plan. They expressed their confidence to varying degrees. After the meeting, Lincoln issued another order, naming specific officers as corps commanders to report to McClellan (who had been reluctant to do so prior to assessing his division commanders' effectiveness in combat, even though this would have meant his direct supervision of twelve divisions in the field).

Two more crises would confront McClellan before he could implement his plans. The Confederate forces under General <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> withdrew from their positions before Washington, assuming new positions south of the Rappahannock, which completely nullified the Urbanna strategy. McClellan revised his plans to have his troops disembark at <a href="Fort%20Monroe%2C%20Virginia">Fort Monroe</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, and advance up the <a href="Virginia%20Peninsula">Virginia Peninsula</a> to Richmond, an operation that would be known as the <a href="Peninsula%20Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a>. Then, however, McClellan came under extreme criticism in the press and Congress when it was learned that Johnston's forces had not only slipped away unnoticed, but had for months fooled the Union Army with logs painted black to appear as cannons, nicknamed <a href="Quaker%20Gun">Quaker Gun</a>s. Congress's joint committee visited the abandoned Confederate lines and radical Republicans introduced a resolution demanding the dismissal of McClellan, but it was narrowly defeated by a parliamentary maneuver. The second crisis was the emergence of the Confederate <a href="ironclad">ironclad</a> <a href="CSS%20Virginia">CSS "Virginia"</a>, which threw Washington into a panic and made naval support operations on the <a href="James%20River%20%28Virginia%29">James River</a> seem problematic.

On March 11, 1862, Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief, leaving him in command of only the Army of the Potomac, ostensibly so that McClellan would be free to devote all his attention to the move on Richmond. Lincoln's order was ambiguous as to whether McClellan might be restored following a successful campaign. In fact, the general-in-chief position was left unfilled. Lincoln, Stanton, and a group of officers who formed the "War Board" directed the strategic actions of the Union armies that spring. Although McClellan was assuaged by supportive comments Lincoln made to him, in time he saw the change of command very differently, describing it as a part of an intrigue "to secure the failure of the approaching campaign".

McClellan's army began to sail from <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria</a> on March 17. It was an armada that dwarfed all previous American expeditions, transporting 121,500 men, 44 artillery batteries, 1,150 wagons, over 15,000 horses, and tons of equipment and supplies. An English observer remarked that it was the "stride of a giant". The army's advance from <a href="Fort%20Monroe">Fort Monroe</a> up the <a href="Virginia%20Peninsula">Virginia Peninsula</a> proved to be slow. McClellan's plan for a rapid seizure of <a href="Yorktown%2C%20Virginia">Yorktown</a> was foiled when he discovered that the Confederates had fortified a line across the Peninsula, causing him to decide on a siege of the city, which required considerable preparation.

McClellan continued to believe intelligence reports that credited the Confederates with two or three times the men they actually had. Early in the campaign, Confederate General <a href="John%20B.%20Magruder">John B. "Prince John" Magruder</a> defended the Peninsula against McClellan's advance with a vastly smaller force. He created a false impression of many troops behind the lines and of even more troops arriving. He accomplished this by marching small groups of men repeatedly past places where they could be observed at a distance or were just out of sight, accompanied by great noise and fanfare. During this time, General Johnston was able to provide Magruder with reinforcements, but even then there were far fewer troops than McClellan believed were opposite him.

After a month of preparation, just before he was to assault the Confederate works at Yorktown, McClellan learned that Johnston had withdrawn up the Peninsula towards <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg</a>. McClellan was thus required to give chase without any benefit of the heavy artillery so carefully amassed in front of Yorktown. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Williamsburg">Battle of Williamsburg</a> on May 5 is considered a Union victory—McClellan's first—but the Confederate army was not destroyed and a bulk of their troops were successfully moved past Williamsburg to Richmond's outer defenses while the battle was waged and for several days thereafter.

McClellan had also placed hopes on a simultaneous naval approach to Richmond via the <a href="James%20River%20%28Virginia%29">James River</a>. That approach failed following the Union Navy's defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Drewry%27s%20Bluff">Battle of Drewry's Bluff</a>, about downstream from the Confederate capital, on May 15. Basing artillery on a strategic bluff high above a bend in the river, and sinking boats to create an impassable series of obstacles in the river itself, the Confederates effectively blocked this potential approach to Richmond.

McClellan's army cautiously inched towards Richmond over the next three weeks, coming to within four miles (6 km) of it. He established a supply base on the <a href="Pamunkey%20River">Pamunkey River</a> (a navigable tributary of the <a href="York%20River%20%28Virginia%29">York River</a>) at <a href="White%20House%20Landing%2C%20Virginia">White House Landing</a> where the <a href="Richmond%20and%20York%20River%20Railroad">Richmond and York River Railroad</a> extending to Richmond crossed, and commandeered the <a href="railroad">railroad</a>, transporting <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>s and rolling stock to the site by barge.

On May 31, as McClellan planned an assault, his army was surprised by a Confederate attack. Johnston saw that the Union army was split in half by the rain-swollen <a href="Chickahominy%20River">Chickahominy River</a> and hoped to <a href="defeat%20in%20detail">defeat it in detail</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Seven%20Pines">Seven Pines</a> and Fair Oaks. McClellan was unable to command the army personally because of a recurrence of malarial fever, but his subordinates were able to repel the attacks. Nevertheless, McClellan received criticism from Washington for not counterattacking, which some believed could have opened the city of Richmond to capture. Johnston was wounded in the battle, and General Robert E. Lee assumed command of the <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>. McClellan spent the next three weeks repositioning his troops and waiting for promised reinforcements, losing valuable time as Lee continued to strengthen Richmond's defenses.

At the end of June, Lee began a series of attacks that became known as the <a href="Seven%20Days%20Battles">Seven Days Battles</a>. The first major battle, at <a href="Battle%20of%20Beaver%20Dam%20Creek">Mechanicsville</a>, was poorly coordinated by Lee and his subordinates and resulted in heavy casualties for little tactical gain. However the battle had a significant impact on McClellan's nerve. The surprise appearance of Maj. Gen. <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Stonewall Jackson</a>'s troops in the battle (when they had last been reported to be many miles away in the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a>) convinced McClellan that he was even more outnumbered than he had thought. He reported to Washington that he faced 200,000 Confederates (the actual number was 85,000.)

As Lee continued his offensive at <a href="Battle%20of%20Gaines%27s%20Mill">Gaines's Mill</a> to the east, McClellan played a passive role, taking no initiative and waiting for events to unfold. He kept two thirds of his army out of action, fooled again by Magruder's theatrical diversionary tactics. That night, he decided to withdraw his army to a safer base, well below Richmond, on a portion of the James River that was under control of the Union Navy. In doing so, he may have unwittingly saved his army. Lee had assumed that the Union army would withdraw to the east toward its existing supply base and McClellan's move to the south delayed Lee's response for at least 24 hours. But McClellan was also tacitly acknowledging that he would no longer be able to <a href="investment%20%28military%29">invest</a> Richmond, the object of his campaign; the heavy siege artillery required would be almost impossible to transport without the railroad connections available from his original supply base on the York River. In a telegram to <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Edwin%20Stanton">Edwin Stanton</a>, reporting on these events, McClellan blamed the Lincoln administration for his reversals. "If I save this army now, I tell you plainly I owe no thanks to you or to any other persons in Washington. You have done your best to sacrifice this army." Fortunately for McClellan, Lincoln never saw that inflammatory statement (at least at that time) because it was censored by the War Department telegrapher.
McClellan was also fortunate that the failure of the campaign left his army mostly intact, because he was generally absent from the fighting and neglected to name any second-in-command who might direct his retreat. Military historian <a href="Stephen%20W.%20Sears">Stephen W. Sears</a> wrote, "When he deserted his army on the <a href="Battle%20of%20Glendale">Glendale</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Malvern%20Hill">Malvern Hill</a> battlefields during the Seven Days, he was guilty of <a href="dereliction%20of%20duty">dereliction of duty</a>. Had the Army of the Potomac been wrecked on either of these fields (at Glendale the possibility had been real), that charge under the Articles of War would likely have been brought against him." In the battle of Glendale, McClellan was five miles (8 km) away behind Malvern Hill, without telegraph communications and too distant to command his army. In the battle of Malvern Hill, he was on a gunboat, the <a href="USS%20Galena%20%281862%29">U.S.S. "Galena"</a>, which at one point was ten miles (16 km) away, down the James River. In both battles, effective command of the army fell to his friend and <a href="V%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">V Corps</a> commander Brigadier General <a href="Fitz%20John%20Porter">Fitz John Porter</a>. When the public heard about the "Galena", it was yet another great embarrassment, comparable to the Quaker Guns at Manassas. Editorial cartoons published in the course of the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">1864 presidential campaign</a> lampooned McClellan for having preferred the safety of a ship while a battle was fought in the distance.

McClellan was reunited with his army at Harrison's Landing on the James. Debates were held as to whether the army should be evacuated or attempt to resume an offensive toward Richmond. McClellan maintained his estrangement from Abraham Lincoln with his repeated call for reinforcements and by writing a lengthy letter in which he proposed strategic and political guidance for the war, continuing his opposition to abolition or seizure of slaves as a tactic. He concluded by implying he should be restored as general-in-chief, but Lincoln responded by naming Maj. Gen. <a href="Henry%20W.%20Halleck">Henry W. Halleck</a> to the post without consulting, or even informing, McClellan. Lincoln and Stanton also offered command of the Army of the Potomac to Maj. Gen. <a href="Ambrose%20Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a>, who refused the appointment.

Back in Washington, a reorganization of units created the <a href="Army%20of%20Virginia">Army of Virginia</a> under Maj. Gen. <a href="John%20Pope%20%28military%20officer%29">John Pope</a>, who was directed to advance toward Richmond from the northeast. McClellan resisted calls to reinforce Pope's army and delayed return of the Army of the Potomac from the Peninsula enough so that the reinforcements arrived while the <a href="Northern%20Virginia%20Campaign">Northern Virginia Campaign</a> was already underway. He wrote to his wife before the battle, "Pope will be thrashed ... & be disposed of [by Lee]. ... Such a villain as he is ought to bring defeat upon any cause that employs him." Lee had assessed McClellan's defensive nature and gambled on removing significant units from the Peninsula to attack Pope, who was beaten decisively at <a href="Second%20Bull%20Run">Second Bull Run</a> in August.

After the defeat of Pope at Second Bull Run, President Lincoln reluctantly returned to the man who had mended a broken army before. He realized that McClellan was a strong organizer and a skilled trainer of troops, able to recombine the units of Pope's army with the Army of the Potomac faster than anyone. On September 2, 1862, Lincoln named McClellan to command "the fortifications of Washington, and all the troops for the defense of the capital". The appointment was controversial in the Cabinet, a majority of whom signed a petition declaring to the president "our deliberate opinion that, at this time, it is not safe to entrust to Major General McClellan the command of any Army of the United States". The president admitted that it was like "curing the bite with the hair of the dog". But Lincoln told his secretary, John Hay, "We must use what tools we have. There is no man in the Army who can man these fortifications and lick these troops of ours into shape half as well as he. If he can't fight himself, he excels in making others ready to fight."

Northern fears of a continued offensive by Robert E. Lee were realized when he launched his <a href="Maryland%20Campaign">Maryland Campaign</a> on September 4, hoping to arouse pro-Southern sympathy in the slave state of <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>. McClellan's pursuit began on September 5. He marched toward Maryland with six of his reorganized corps, about 84,000 men, while leaving two corps behind to defend Washington. McClellan's reception in <a href="Frederick%2C%20Maryland">Frederick, Maryland</a>, as he marched towards Lee's army, was described by the correspondent for <a href="Harper%27s%20Magazine">Harper's Magazine</a>:

Lee divided his forces into multiple columns, spread apart widely as he moved into Maryland and also maneuvered to capture the federal arsenal at <a href="Harpers%20Ferry%2C%20West%20Virginia">Harpers Ferry</a>. This was a risky move for a smaller army, but Lee was counting on his knowledge of McClellan's temperament. He told one of his generals, "He is an able general but a very cautious one. His army is in a very demoralized and chaotic condition, and will not be prepared for offensive operations—or he will not think it so—for three or four weeks. Before that time I hope to be on the Susquehanna." This was not a completely accurate assessment, but McClellan's army was moving lethargically, averaging only a day.

However, McClellan soon received a miraculous break of fortune. Union soldiers accidentally found a <a href="Special%20Order%20191">copy of Lee's orders</a> dividing his army, wrapped around a package of cigars in an abandoned camp. They delivered the order to McClellan's headquarters in Frederick on September 13. Upon realizing the intelligence value of this discovery, McClellan threw up his arms and exclaimed, "Now I know what to do!" He waved the order at his old Army friend, <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brig. Gen.</a> <a href="John%20Gibbon">John Gibbon</a>, and said, "Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I will be willing to go home." He telegraphed President Lincoln: "I have the whole rebel force in front of me, but I am confident, and no time shall be lost. I think Lee has made a gross mistake, and that he will be severely punished for it. I have all the plans of the rebels, and will catch them in their own trap if my men are equal to the emergency. ... Will send you trophies."

Despite this show of bravado, McClellan continued his cautious line. After telegraphing to the president at noon on September 13, rather than ordering his units to set out for the South Mountain passes immediately, he ordered them to depart the following morning. The 18 hours of delay allowed Lee time to react, because he received intelligence from a Confederate sympathizer that McClellan knew of his plans. (The delay also doomed the federal garrison at Harpers Ferry because the relief column McClellan sent could not reach them before they surrendered to Stonewall Jackson.) In the <a href="Battle%20of%20South%20Mountain">Battle of South Mountain</a>, McClellan's army was able to punch through the defended passes that separated them from Lee, but also gave Lee enough time to concentrate many of his men at <a href="Sharpsburg%2C%20Maryland">Sharpsburg</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>. The Battle of South Mountain presented McClellan with an opportunity for one of the great theatrical moments of his career, as historian Sears describes:

The Union army reached Antietam Creek, to the east of Sharpsburg, on the evening of September 15. A planned attack on September 16 was put off because of early morning fog, allowing Lee to prepare his defenses with an army less than half the size of McClellan's.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a> on September 17, 1862, was the single bloodiest day in American military history. The outnumbered Confederate forces fought desperately and well. Despite significant advantages in manpower, McClellan was unable to concentrate his forces effectively, which meant that Lee was able to shift his defenders to parry each of three Union thrusts, launched separately and sequentially against the Confederate left, center, and finally the right. McClellan was also unwilling, due to Porter's opinion, to employ his ample reserve forces to capitalize on localized successes. Historian <a href="James%20M.%20McPherson">James M. McPherson</a> has pointed out that the two corps McClellan kept in reserve were in fact larger than Lee's entire force. The reason for McClellan's reluctance was that, as in previous battles, he was convinced he was outnumbered.
The battle was tactically inconclusive, with the Union suffering a higher overall number of casualties, although Lee technically was defeated because he withdrew first from the battlefield and retreated back to Virginia, and lost a larger percentage of his army than McClellen did. McClellan wired to Washington, "Our victory was complete. The enemy is driven back into Virginia." Yet there was obvious disappointment that McClellan had not crushed Lee, who was fighting with a smaller army with its back to the Potomac River. Although McClellan's subordinates can claim their share of responsibility for delays (such as <a href="Ambrose%20Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a>'s misadventures at Burnside Bridge) and blunders (<a href="Edwin%20V.%20Sumner">Edwin V. Sumner</a>'s attack without reconnaissance), these were localized problems from which the full army could have recovered. As with the decisive battles in the Seven Days, McClellan's headquarters were too far to the rear to allow his personal control over the battle. He made no use of his cavalry forces for reconnaissance. He did not share his overall battle plans with his corps commanders, which prevented them from using initiative outside of their sectors. And he was far too willing to accept cautious advice about saving his reserves, such as when a significant breakthrough in the center of the Confederate line could have been exploited, but <a href="Fitz%20John%20Porter">Fitz John Porter</a> is said to have told McClellan, "Remember, General, I command the last reserve of the last Army of the Republic."

Despite being a tactical draw, Antietam is considered a <a href="Turning%20Point%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">turning point</a> of the war and a victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of the North) and it allowed President Lincoln to issue the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> on September 22, taking effect on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended to issue the proclamation earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to wait until a Union victory to avoid the perception that it was issued out of desperation. The Union victory and Lincoln's proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">France</a> and <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Britain</a> from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning to do so in the aftermath of another Union defeat. McClellan had no prior knowledge that the plans for emancipation rested on his battle performance.

Because McClellan failed to pursue Lee aggressively after Antietam, Lincoln ordered that he be removed from command on November 5, 1862. Maj. Gen. <a href="Ambrose%20Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a> assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on November 9, 1862. McClellan wrote to his wife, "Those in whose judgment I rely tell me that I fought the battle splendidly and that it was a masterpiece of art. ... I feel I have done all that can be asked in twice saving the country. ... I feel some little pride in having, with a beaten & demoralized army, defeated Lee so utterly. ... Well, one of these days history will I trust do me justice."

Secretary Stanton ordered McClellan to report to <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, for further orders, although none were issued. As the war progressed, there were various calls to return McClellan to an important command, following the Union defeats at <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Fredericksburg</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Chancellorsville">Chancellorsville</a>, as Robert E. Lee moved north at the start of the <a href="Gettysburg%20Campaign">Gettysburg Campaign</a>, and as <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a> threatened Washington in 1864. When Ulysses S. Grant became general-in-chief, he discussed returning McClellan to an unspecified position. But all of these opportunities were impossible, given the opposition within the administration and the knowledge that McClellan posed a potential political threat. McClellan worked for months on a lengthy report describing his two major campaigns and his successes in organizing the Army, replying to his critics and justifying his actions by accusing the administration of undercutting him and denying him necessary reinforcements. The War Department was reluctant to publish his report because, just after completing it in October 1863, McClellan openly declared his entrance to the political stage as a Democrat.
McClellan was nominated by the <a href="1864%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democrats</a> to run against <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201864">1864 U.S. presidential election</a>. Following the example of <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>, he ran as a U.S. Army general still on active duty; he did not resign his commission until election day, November 8, 1864. McClellan supported continuation of the war and restoration of the Union (but not the abolition of slavery), but the party platform, written by <a href="Copperheads%20%28politics%29">Copperhead</a> leader <a href="Clement%20Vallandigham">Clement Vallandigham</a> of Ohio, was opposed to this position. The platform called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a negotiated settlement with the Confederacy. McClellan was forced to repudiate the platform, which made his campaign inconsistent and difficult. He also was not helped by the party's choice for vice president, <a href="George%20H.%20Pendleton">George H. Pendleton</a>, a peace candidate from Ohio.

The deep division in the party, the unity of the <a href="United%20States%20Republican%20Party">Republicans</a> (running under the label "National Union Party"), the absence of a large portion of the Democrats' base (the South) from the voter pool, and the military successes by Union forces in the fall of 1864 doomed McClellan's candidacy. Lincoln won the election handily, with 212 <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a> votes to 21 and a popular vote of 2,218,388 to 1,812,807 or 55% to 45%. For all his popularity with the troops, McClellan failed to secure their support and the military vote went to Lincoln nearly 3–1. Lincoln's share of the vote in the Army of the Potomac was 70%.

At the conclusion of the war (1865) McClellan and his family went to Europe, not returning until 1868; in this period he did not participate in politics. Prior to his return in September 1868, the Democratic Party had expressed some interest in nominating him for president again, but Ulysses S. Grant became the Republican candidate in May 1868, and this interest died.
McClellan worked on engineering projects in New York City and was offered the position of president of the newly formed <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a> (established in 1868).

McClellan was appointed chief engineer of the New York City Department of Docks in 1870. Evidently the position did not demand his full-time attention because, starting in 1872, he also served as the president of the <a href="Atlantic%20and%20Great%20Western%20Railroad">Atlantic and Great Western Railroad</a>. He and his family then embarked on another three-year stay in Europe (1873–75)

In March 1877 the Governor of New York, <a href="Lucius%20Robinson">Lucius Robinson</a>, nominated McClellan as the first <a href="New%20York%20State%20Department%20of%20Public%20Works">Superintendent of Public Works</a>, but the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Senate">New York State Senate</a> rejected him as "incompetent for the position".

In 1877 the Democrats nominated McClellan for <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20Jersey">Governor of New Jersey</a>, an action that took him by surprise because he had not expressed an interest in the position. He accepted the nomination, won election, and served a single term from 1878 to 1881, a tenure marked by careful, conservative executive management and by minimal political rancor. The concluding chapter of his political career was his strong support in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201884">1884</a> for the election of <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>. He sought the position of <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> in Cleveland's cabinet, for which he was well qualified, but political rivals from New Jersey succeeded in blocking his nomination.

McClellan devoted his final years to traveling and writing; he produced his memoirs, "McClellan's Own Story" (published posthumously in 1887), in which he stridently defended his conduct during the war. He died unexpectedly of a heart attack at age 58 at <a href="Orange%2C%20New%20Jersey">Orange</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, after suffering from chest pains for a few weeks. His final words, at 3 a.m., October 29, 1885, were, "I feel easy now. Thank you." He was buried at <a href="Riverview%20Cemetery%20%28Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey%29">Riverview Cemetery</a> in <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton</a>.

McClellan's son, <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan%20Jr.">George B. McClellan Jr.</a> (1865–1940), was born in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Saxony">Kingdom of Saxony</a> during the family's first trip to Europe. Known within the family as Max, he too became a politician, serving as a <a href="United%20States%20Representative">United States Representative</a> from New York State (1893–1903) and as <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor of New York City</a> from 1904 to 1909.

McClellan's daughter, Mary ("May") (1861–1945), married a French diplomat and spent much of her life abroad.

McClellan's wife, Ellen, died in <a href="Nice%2C%20France">Nice, France</a> in 1915 while visiting May at her home "Villa Antietam". Neither Max nor May had any children of their own.

The New York <a href="New%20York%20Post">"Evening Post"</a> commented in McClellan's obituary, "Probably no soldier who did so little fighting has ever had his qualities as a commander so minutely, and we may add, so fiercely discussed." This fierce discussion has continued for over a century. McClellan is usually ranked in the lowest tier of Civil War generals. However, the debate over McClellan's ability and talents remains the subject of much controversy among Civil War and military historians. He has been universally praised for his organizational abilities and for his very good relations with his troops. They referred to him affectionately as "Little Mac"; others sometimes called him the "Young Napoleon". It has been suggested that his reluctance to enter battle was caused in part by an intense desire to avoid spilling the blood of his men. Ironically, this led to failing to take the initiative against the enemy and therefore passing up good opportunities for decisive victories, which could have ended the war early, and thereby could have spared thousands of soldiers who died in those subsequent battles. Generals who proved successful in the war, such as Lee and Grant, tended to be more aggressive and more willing to risk a major battle even when all preparations were not perfect. McClellan himself summed up his cautious nature in a draft of his memoirs:

McClellan's reluctance to press his enemy aggressively was probably not a matter of personal courage, which he demonstrated well enough by his bravery under fire in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>. However, his initiative on the battlefield was not so decisive, as Stephen Sears wrote,

One of the reasons that McClellan's reputation has suffered is his own memoirs. Historian <a href="Allan%20Nevins">Allan Nevins</a> wrote, "Students of history must always be grateful McClellan so frankly exposed his own weaknesses in this posthumous book." <a href="Doris%20Kearns%20Goodwin">Doris Kearns Goodwin</a> claims that a review of his personal correspondence during the war reveals a tendency for self-aggrandizement and unwarranted self-congratulation. His original draft was completed in 1881, but the only copy was destroyed by fire. He began to write another draft of what would be published posthumously, in 1887, as "McClellan's Own Story". However, he died before it was half completed and his literary executor, William C. Prime, editor of the pro-McClellan New York "Journal of Commerce", included excerpts from some 250 of McClellan's wartime letters to his wife, in which it had been his habit to reveal his innermost feelings and opinions in unbridled fashion.

Robert E. Lee, on being asked (by his cousin, and recorded by his son) who was the ablest general on the Union side during the late war, replied emphatically: "McClellan, by all odds!"

While McClellan's reputation has suffered over time, especially over the later half of the 20th century, there is a small but intense cadre of American Civil War historians who believe that the general has been poorly served in at least four regards. First, McClellan proponents say that because the general was a conservative Democrat with great personal charisma, radical Republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations. Second, that as the radical Republicans were the true winners coming out of the American Civil War, they were able to write its history, placing their principal political rival of the time, McClellan, in the worst possible light. Third, that historians eager to jump on the bandwagon of Lincoln as America's greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to McClellan. And fourth, that Lincoln and Stanton deliberately undermined McClellan because of his conciliatory stance towards the South, which might have resulted in a less destructive end to the war had Richmond fallen as a result of the Peninsula Campaign. Proponents of this school claim that McClellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance.

Several geographic features and establishments have been named for George B. McClellan. These include <a href="Fort%20McClellan">Fort McClellan</a> in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="McClellan%20Butte">McClellan Butte</a> and <a href="McClellan%20Peak">McClellan Peak</a> in the state of Washington, where he traveled while conducting the Pacific Railroad Survey in 1853, and a bronze <a href="equestrian%20statue">equestrian statue</a> honoring General McClellan in Washington, D.C.

McClellan Park in <a href="Milbridge%2C%20Maine">Milbridge, Maine</a>, was donated to the town by the general's son with the stipulation that it be named for the general. <a href="Camp%20McClellan%20%28Iowa%29">Camp McClellan</a>, in Davenport, IA, is a former <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> camp established in August 1861 after the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. The camp was the training grounds for recruits and a hospital for the wounded.
