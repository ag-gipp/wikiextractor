Luton Town F.C.

Luton Town Football Club () is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in the town of <a href="Luton">Luton</a>, Bedfordshire, England, that competes in <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a>, the third tier of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. Founded in 1885, it is nicknamed "the Hatters" and affiliated to the <a href="Bedfordshire%20County%20Football%20Association">Bedfordshire County Football Association</a>. The team plays its home matches at <a href="Kenilworth%20Road">Kenilworth Road</a>, where it has been based since 1905. The club's history includes major trophy wins, several financial crises, numerous <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotions and relegations</a>, and some spells of sustained success. It was perhaps most prominent between 1982 and 1992, when it was a member of English football's top division, at that time the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>; the team won its only major honour, the <a href="EFL%20Cup">Football League Cup</a>, in 1988.

The club was the first in southern England to turn professional, making payments to players as early as 1890 and turning fully professional a year later. It joined <a href="English%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> before the <a href="1897%E2%80%9398%20Football%20League">1897–98 season</a>, left in 1900 because of financial problems, and rejoined in 1920. Luton reached the First Division in <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20in%20English%20football">1955–56</a> and contested a major final for the first time when playing <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> in the <a href="1959%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1959 FA Cup Final</a>. The team was then relegated from the top division in <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20in%20English%20football">1959–60</a>, and demoted twice more in the following five years, playing in the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> from the <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20in%20English%20football">1965–66 season</a>. However, it was promoted back to the top level by <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1974–75</a>.

Luton Town's most recent successful period began in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Football%20League">1981–82</a>, when the club won the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>, and thereby gained promotion to the First. Luton defeated <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> 3–2 in the <a href="1988%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1988 Football League Cup Final</a> and remained in the First Division until relegation at the end of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1991–92 season</a>. Between 2007 and 2009, financial difficulties caused the club to fall from the second tier of English football to the fifth in successive seasons. The last of these relegations came during the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2008–09 season</a>, when 30 points were docked from Luton's record for various financial irregularities. Luton thereafter spent five seasons in <a href="non-League%20football">non-League football</a> before winning the <a href="Conference%20Premier">Conference Premier</a> in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a>, securing promotion back into the Football League.

Luton Town Football Club was formed on 11 April 1885. Before this there were many clubs in the town, the most prominent of which were Luton Wanderers and Luton Excelsior. A Wanderers player, George Deacon, came up with the idea of a "Town" club which would include all the best players in Luton. Wanderers secretary Herbert Spratley seized upon Deacon's idea and arranged a secret meeting on 13 January 1885 at the St Matthews school rooms in <a href="High%20Town%2C%20Luton">High Town</a>. The Wanderers committee resolved to rename the club Luton Town—which was not well received by the wider community. The local newspapers referred to the club as "Luton Town (late Wanderers)". When George Deacon and John Charles Lomax then arranged a public meeting with the purpose of forming a "Luton Town Football Club", Spratley protested, saying there was already a Luton Town club; and the atmosphere was tense when the meeting convened in the town hall on the 11 April 1885. The meeting, attended by most football lovers in the town, heard about Spratley's secret January meeting and voted down his objections. The motion to form a "Luton Town Football Club", put forward by G H Small and seconded by E H Lomax, was carried. A club committee was elected by ballot and the team colours were agreed to be pink and dark blue shirts and caps.

Initially based at Excelsior's <a href="Dallow%20Lane">Dallow Lane</a> ground, Luton Town began making payments to certain individual players in 1890. The following year, Luton became the first club in southern England to be fully professional. The club was a founder member of the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern Football League</a> in the 1894–95 season and finished as runners-up in its first two seasons. It then left to help form the United League and came second in that league's inaugural season before joining <a href="English%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> (then based mostly in northern and central England) for <a href="1897%E2%80%9398%20Football%20League">1897–98</a>, concurrently moving to a new ground at <a href="Dunstable%20Road">Dunstable Road</a>. The club continued to enter a team to the United League for two more seasons, and won the title in 1897–98. Poor attendance, high wages and the high travel and accommodation costs that resulted from Luton's distance from the northern heartlands of the Football League crippled the club financially, and made it too expensive to compete in that league. A return to the Southern League was therefore arranged for the <a href="1900%E2%80%9301%20Southern%20Football%20League">1900–01 season</a>.

Eight years after arriving at Dunstable Road, Luton moved again, settling at their current ground, <a href="Kenilworth%20Road">Kenilworth Road</a>, in 1905. <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">Captain</a> and <a href="Midfielder%23Winger">left winger</a> <a href="Robert%20Hawkes">Bob Hawkes</a> became Luton's first international player when he was picked to play for <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> against <a href="Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29">Ireland</a> on 16 February 1907. A poor <a href="1911%E2%80%9312%20Southern%20Football%20League">1911–12 season</a> saw Luton relegated to the Southern League's Second Division; the club won promotion back two years later. After the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> broke out, Luton took part in <a href="The%20Football%20Combination">The London Combination</a> during <a href="1915%E2%80%9316%20in%20English%20football">1915–16</a>, and afterwards filled each season with <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly matches</a>. A key player of the period was <a href="Ernie%20Simms">Ernie Simms</a>, a <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">forward</a>. Simms was invalided back to England after being wounded on the <a href="Italian%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Italian front</a>, but recovered enough to regain his place in the Luton team and scored 40 goals during the <a href="1916%E2%80%9317%20in%20English%20football">1916–17 season</a>.

The Luton side first played in the white and black colours which it has retained for much of its history during the <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">1920–21 season</a>, when the club rejoined the Football League; the players had previously worn an assortment of colour combinations, most permanently <a href="sky%20blue">sky blue</a> shirts with white shorts and navy socks. Such was the quality of Luton's team at this time that despite playing in the third tier, a fixture between Ireland and England at <a href="Windsor%20Park">Windsor Park</a> on 22 October 1921 saw three Luton players on the pitch—<a href="Louis%20Bookman">Louis Bookman</a> and <a href="Allan%20Mathieson">Allan Mathieson</a> for Ireland, and the club's top goalscorer, Simms, for England. However, after Luton finished fourth in the division, the squad was broken up as Simms, Bookman and Mathieson joined <a href="South%20Shields%20F.C.%20%281889%29">South Shields</a>, <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a> and <a href="Exeter%20City%20F.C.">Exeter City</a> respectively. Luton stayed in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> until <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20in%20English%20football">1936–37</a>, when the team finished top and won promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>, at that time the second tier of English football. During the promotion season, <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a> <a href="Joe%20Payne%20%28footballer%29">Joe Payne</a> scored 55 goals in 39 games; during the previous season he had scored 10 in one match against <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a>, which remains a Football League record today.

During the early 1950s, one of Luton's greatest sides emerged under manager <a href="Dally%20Duncan">Dally Duncan</a>. The team included <a href="Gordon%20Turner">Gordon Turner</a>, who went on to become Luton's all-time top goalscorer, <a href="Bob%20Morton%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201927%29">Bob Morton</a>, who holds the record for the most club appearances, and <a href="Syd%20Owen">Syd Owen</a>, an England international. During this period, Luton sides also featured two England international goalkeepers, <a href="Ron%20Baynham">Ron Baynham</a> and <a href="Bernard%20Streten">Bernard Streten</a>, as well as <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Irish internationals</a> <a href="Seamus%20Dunne">Seamus Dunne</a>, <a href="Tom%20Aherne">Tom Aherne</a> and <a href="George%20Cummins%20%28footballer%29">George Cummins</a>. This team reached the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">top flight</a> for the first time in <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20in%20English%20football">1955–56</a>, after finishing the season in second place behind <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> on <a href="goal%20average">goal average</a>. A few years of success followed, including an <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final%201959">FA Cup Final appearance</a> against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a>; at the end of the season, Owen was voted <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Footballer of the Year</a>. However, the club was relegated the following season and, by <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20in%20English%20football">1964–65</a>, was playing in the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">fourth tier</a>.

In <a href="yo-yo%20club">yo-yo club</a> fashion, Luton were to return. A team including <a href="Bruce%20Rioch">Bruce Rioch</a>, <a href="John%20Moore%20%28footballer%2C%20born%20December%201943%29">John Moore</a> and <a href="Graham%20French">Graham French</a> won the Fourth Division championship in <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20in%20English%20football">1967–68</a> under the leadership of former player <a href="Allan%20Brown%20%28footballer%29">Allan Brown</a>; two years later <a href="Malcolm%20Macdonald">Malcolm Macdonald</a>'s goals helped them to another promotion, while comedian <a href="Eric%20Morecambe">Eric Morecambe</a> became a director of the club. Luton Town won promotion back to the First Division in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20Football%20League">1973–74</a>, but were relegated <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">the following season</a> by a solitary point. Former Luton player <a href="David%20Pleat">David Pleat</a> was made manager in 1978, and by <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football">1982–83</a> the team was back in the top flight. The team which Pleat assembled at Kenilworth Road was notable at the time for the number of <a href="black%20people">black</a> players it included; during an era when many English squads were almost entirely white, Luton often fielded a mostly black team. Talented players such as <a href="Ricky%20Hill">Ricky Hill</a>, <a href="Brian%20Stein">Brian Stein</a> and <a href="Emeka%20Nwajiobi">Emeka Nwajiobi</a> made key contributions to the club's success during this period, causing it to accrue "a richer history of black stars than any in the country", in the words of journalist Gavin Willacy.

On the last day of the 1982–83 season, the club's first back in the top tier, it narrowly escaped relegation: playing <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> at <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a>, Luton needed to win to stay up, while City could escape with a draw. A late winner by <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavian</a> substitute <a href="Radomir%20Anti%C4%87">Raddy Antić</a> saved the team and prompted Pleat to dance across the pitch performing a "jig of joy", an image that has become <a href="icon">icon</a>ic. The club achieved its highest ever league position, seventh, under <a href="John%20Moore%20%28footballer%2C%20born%20December%201943%29">John Moore</a> in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1986–87</a>, and, managed by <a href="Ray%20Harford">Ray Harford</a>, won the <a href="EFL%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> a year later with a <a href="1988%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">3–2 win</a> over <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. With ten minutes left on the clock and Arsenal 2–1 ahead, a penalty save from stand-in goalkeeper <a href="Andy%20Dibble">Andy Dibble</a> sparked a late Luton rally: <a href="Danny%20Wilson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201960%29">Danny Wilson</a> equalised, before <a href="Brian%20Stein">Brian Stein</a> scored the winner with the last kick of the match. The club reached the <a href="1989%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup Final</a> once more in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1988–89</a>, but lost 3–1 to Nottingham Forest.

The club was relegated from the top division at the end of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1991–92 season</a>, and sank to the third tier <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">four years later</a>. Luton stayed in the third-tier Second Division until relegation at the end of the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2000–01 season</a>. Under the management of <a href="Joe%20Kinnear">Joe Kinnear</a>, who had arrived halfway through the previous season, the team won promotion from the fourth tier at the first attempt. "Controversial" owner John Gurney unsettled the club in 2003, terminating Kinnear's contract on his arrival in May; Gurney replaced Kinnear with <a href="Mike%20Newell%20%28footballer%29">Mike Newell</a> before leaving Luton as the club entered <a href="Administration%20%28law%29">administration</a>. Newell's team finished as champions of the rebranded third-tier <a href="EFL%20League%20One">Football League One</a> in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2004–05</a>.

While Newell's place was taken first by <a href="Kevin%20Blackwell">Kevin Blackwell</a> and later former player <a href="Mick%20Harford">Mick Harford</a>, the team was then relegated twice in a row, starting in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2006–07</a>, and spent the latter part of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a> in administration, thus incurring a ten-point deduction from that season's total. The club then had a total of 30 points docked from its <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2008–09</a> record by <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> and the Football League for financial irregularities dating back several years. These deductions proved to be too large an obstacle to overcome, but Luton came from behind in the final of the <a href="EFL%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> to win the competition for the first time.

Relegation meant that <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2009–10</a> saw Luton playing in the <a href="Conference%20Premier">Conference Premier</a>, a competition in which the club had never before participated. The club unsuccessfully contested the promotion play-offs three times in four seasons during their time as a non-League club, employing five different managers. In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20FA%20Cup">2012–13 FA Cup</a> fourth round, Luton won their <a href="Norwich%20City%200%E2%80%931%20Luton%20Town%20%282013%29">away tie</a> against <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> club <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> 1–0 and, in doing so, became the first non-League team to beat a side from England's top division since 1989. In the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2013–14 season</a>, under the management of <a href="John%20Still%20%28footballer%29">John Still</a>, Luton won the Conference Premier title with three games to spare, and thereby secured a return to the Football League from <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2014–15</a>. Another promotion followed three years later, putting Luton back in League One from the start of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2018–19</a> campaign.

The club's <a href="List%20of%20football%20club%20nicknames%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">nickname</a>, "the Hatters", reflects Luton's historical connection with the <a href="Hatmaking">hat making</a> trade, which has been prominent there since the 17th century. The nickname was originally a variant on the now rarely seen straw-plaiters. Supporters of the club are also called Hatters.

The club is associated with two very different colour schemes—white and black (first permanently adopted in 1920), and orange, navy and white (first used in 1973, and worn by the team as of the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2015–16 season</a>). Luton mainly wore a combination of light blue and white before 1920, when white shirts and black shorts were first adopted. These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white at the start of the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20in%20English%20football">1973–74 season</a>. Luton began playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the orange and navy motif reduced to trim; navy shorts were adopted in 1984. This palette was retained until the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000 season</a>, when the team played in orange shirts and blue shorts. From 2000 to 2008, Luton returned to white shirts and black shorts; orange was included as trim until 2007. The white, navy and orange palette favoured in the 1980s was brought back in 2008, following the results of a club poll, but a year later the colours were changed yet again, this time to a predominantly orange strip with white shorts. Navy shorts were readopted in 2011. Luton are wearing orange shirts, navy shorts and white socks during the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2015–16 season</a>.

Luton Town have traditionally used the town's crest as its own in a manner similar to many other teams. The club's first badge was a white eight-pointed star, which was emblazoned across the team's shirts (then a deep <a href="cochineal">cochineal</a> red) in 1892. Four years later a crest comprising the club's initials intertwined was briefly adopted. The shirts were thereafter plain until 1933, when Luton first adopted a badge depicting a straw boater, which appeared on Luton shirts. The letters "LTFC" were added in 1935, and this basic design remained until 1947. The club then played without a badge until 1970, when the club began to wear the town crest regularly, having first done so in the 1959 FA Cup Final.

In 1973, concurrently with the club's switch to the orange kit, a new badge was introduced featuring the new colours. The new emblem depicted a stylised orange football, bearing the letters "Lt", surrounded by the club's name in navy blue text. In 1987, the club switched back to a derivative of the town emblem, with the shield portion of the heraldic crest becoming the team's badge; the only similarity with the previous design was the inclusion of the club name around the shield in navy blue. The "rainbow" badge, introduced in 1994, featured the town crest below an orange and blue bow which curved around to meet two footballs, positioned on either side of the shield, with the club name underneath. This badge was used until 2005, when a replacement very similar to the 1987 version was adopted, featuring black text rather than blue and a straw boater in place of the outstretched arm depicted in the older design. The club's founding year, 1885, was added in 2008. The badge was altered once more during the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2009–10</a> pre-season, with the red of the town crest being replaced with orange to better reflect the club colours.

The first sponsor to appear on a Luton Town shirt was Tricentrol, a local motor company based in <a href="Dunstable">Dunstable</a>, who sponsored the club from March 1980 to 1982; the deal was worth £50,000. Subsequent sponsors have been <a href="Bedford%20Vehicles">Bedford Trucks</a> (1982 to 1990), <a href="Vauxhall%20Motors">Vauxhall</a> (1990 to 1991), Universal Salvage Auctions (1991 to 1999), <a href="SKF">SKF</a> (1999 to 2003), Travel Extras (2003 to 2005), <a href="Electrolux">Electrolux</a> (2005 to 2008), <a href="Carbrini%20Sportswear">Carbrini Sportswear</a> (2008 to 2009), <a href="EasyJet">EasyJet</a> and <a href="National%20Inspection%20Council%20for%20Electrical%20Installation%20Contracting">NICEIC</a> (concurrently, 2009 to 2015), and <a href="Barnfield%20College">Barnfield College</a> and NICEIC (concurrently, 2015 to 2016). Since June 2016, the club's kit has been sponsored by NICEIC and <a href="SsangYong%20Motor">SsangYong Motor UK</a>.

The club released the song "Hatters, Hatters", a collaboration between the Luton team and the Bedfordshire-based musical comedy group <a href="the%20Barron%20Knights">the Barron Knights</a>, in 1974. Eight years later another song featuring vocals by the Luton players, "We're Luton Town", was released to celebrate the club's promotion to the First Division.

Luton Town's first ground was at <a href="Dallow%20Lane">Dallow Lane</a>, the former ground of Excelsior. The ground was next to the <a href="Dunstable%20Branch%20Lines">Dunstable to Luton railway line</a>, and players regularly claimed to have trouble seeing the ball because of smoke from the trains. A damaging financial loss during <a href="1896%E2%80%9397%20in%20English%20football">1896–97</a> forced Luton to sell the stadium to stay afloat and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road. The <a href="Dunstable%20Road">Dunstable Road</a> ground was opened by <a href="Herbrand%20Russell%2C%2011th%20Duke%20of%20Bedford">Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford</a>, who also donated £50 towards the £800 building costs. When the site was sold for housing in 1905, the club was forced to move again at short notice, to its present <a href="Kenilworth%20Road">Kenilworth Road</a> site, in time for the start of the <a href="1905%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">1905–06 season</a>.

The 10,356 capacity <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a> is in the <a href="Bury%20Park">Bury Park</a> area of <a href="Luton">Luton</a> and named after the road that runs along one end of it, although the official address of the club is 1 Maple Road. Opposite the eponymous Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End, which has evolved from a stand first used exclusively by Luton supporters, then later by away supporters, and now used by both except in times of high ticket demand from away clubs. The Main Stand is flanked by the <a href="David%20Preece%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201963%29">David Preece</a> Stand, and opposite them stands a row of executive boxes. These boxes replaced the Bobbers Stand in 1986, as the club sought to maximise income.

The original Main Stand burnt down in 1921, and was replaced by the current stand before the <a href="1922%E2%80%9323%20in%20English%20football">1922–23 season</a>. The ground underwent extensive redevelopment during the 1930s, and the capacity by the start of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> was 30,000. <a href="Floodlights%20%28sport%29">Floodlights</a> were installed before the <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20in%20English%20football">1953–54 season</a>, but it was 20 years before any further modernisation was carried out. In 1973 the Bobbers Stand became all-seated, and in 1985 the grass pitch was replaced with an <a href="Artificial%20turf">artificial playing surface</a>; it quickly became unpopular and was derided as "the plastic pitch".

A <a href="1985%20Kenilworth%20Road%20riot">serious incident involving hooliganism</a> before, during and after a match against <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> in 1985 caused the club's then chairman, <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> <a href="David%20Evans%20%28British%20politician%29">David Evans</a>, to introduce a scheme effective from the start of <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1986–87</a> banning all visiting supporters from the ground, and requiring home fans to carry membership cards when attending matches. Conversion to an all-seater ground also began in 1986. Away fans returned for <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1990–91</a>, and grass a year later. The David Preece Stand was erected in 1991, and the conversion of the Kenilworth Stand to an all-seater was completed in 2005.

The club first stated its intent to leave Kenilworth Road in 1955. Even then the ground was small compared to rival stadia, and its location made significant redevelopment difficult. The team has since made several attempts to relocate. Leaving Luton for the nearby new town of <a href="Milton%20Keynes">Milton Keynes</a> was unsuccessfully <a href="Relocation%20of%20Wimbledon%20F.C.%20to%20Milton%20Keynes%23Luton%20Town%E2%80%94%26quot%3BMK%20Hatters%26quot%3B%20%281980s%29">proposed</a> several times, most notably in the 1980s. The club sold Kenilworth Road to Luton Council in 1989, and has since leased it. A planning application for a new ground, the "Kohlerdome" proposed by chairman <a href="David%20Kohler%20%28developer%29">David Kohler</a> in 1995, was turned down by the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Secretary of State</a> in 1998, and Kohler left soon after.

In 2007, the club's then-owners proposed a controversial plan to relocate to a site near Junction 12 of the <a href="M1%20motorway%20%28England%29">M1 motorway</a>, near <a href="Harlington%2C%20Bedfordshire">Harlington</a> and <a href="Toddington%2C%20Bedfordshire">Toddington</a>. A planning application was made on the club's behalf by former chairman Cliff Bassett, but the application was withdrawn almost immediately following the club's takeover in 2008. In 2009, the club began an independent feasibility study to determine a viable location to move to. The club did not rule out redeveloping Kenilworth Road and, in October 2012, entered talks to buy the stadium back from Luton Borough Council. By 2015, these plans had been dropped in favour of a move to a new location, with managing director Gary Sweet confirming that the club was in a position to "buy land, secure the best possible professional advice ... and to see the [planning] application process through to the receipt of consent."

In April 2016, the club announced its intention to build and move into a 17,500-capacity stadium on the Power Court site in central Luton. Planning permission for this ground, with potential to expand to 23,000 seats, was granted by Luton Borough Council on 16 January 2019..

During the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a>, Luton Town had an average home league attendance of 8,702—the second highest in <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">League Two</a> behind only <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a>. In the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Luton%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2013–14 season</a>, when the club were in the <a href="Conference%20Premier">Conference Premier</a>, the club had significantly higher support than the other clubs in its league, with an average home attendance of 7,387; more than twice compared to the second highest of 3,568. Average attendances at Kenilworth Road fell with the installation of seats and the club's reduction in stature, dropping from 13,452 in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football">1982–83</a> to their 2014–15 level—a slump of 35% over 32 years. A <a href="supporters%27%20trust">supporters' trust</a>, <a href="Trust%20in%20Luton">Trust in Luton</a>, owns shares in the club and elects a representative to the club's board. The club's official supporters' group, Luton Town Supporters' Club, merged with Trust in Luton in 2014. The club is associated with another supporters' group, the breakaway <a href="Loyal%20Luton%20Supporters%20Club">Loyal Luton Supporters Club</a>. Trust in Luton has, since March 2014, held the legal right to veto any changes to the club's identity, including name, nickname, colours, club crest and mascot.

Luton Town supporters maintain a bitter rivalry with <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>-based <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a>. Watford have remained the higher ranked team at the end of every season since 1997. However, overall Luton still hold the superior record in the fixture between the two clubs; out of 118 competitive matches there have been 53 Luton victories and 36 for Watford, with 29 draws. A survey taken in 2003 showed that there was also animosity between Luton Town fans and those of west London club <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>.

The club produces an official match programme for home games, "Talk of the Town". A character known as Happy Harry, a smiling man wearing a straw boater, serves as the team's mascot and appears on the Kenilworth Road pitch before matches. In December 2014, after the seafront statue of Eric Morecambe in his birthplace <a href="Morecambe">Morecambe</a> was restored, Luton and <a href="Morecambe%20F.C.">Morecambe F.C.</a> jointly announced that the winners of future Luton–Morecambe fixtures would be awarded the "Eric Morecambe Trophy".

The record for the most appearances for Luton is held by <a href="Bob%20Morton%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201927%29">Bob Morton</a>, who turned out for Luton 562 times in all competitions. Morton also holds the record for the most Football League appearances for the club, with 495. <a href="Fred%20Hawkes">Fred Hawkes</a> holds the record for the most league appearances for Luton, having played in 509 league matches. Six players, <a href="Gordon%20Turner">Gordon Turner</a>, <a href="Andy%20Rennie%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29">Andy Rennie</a>, <a href="Brian%20Stein">Brian Stein</a>, <a href="Ernie%20Simms">Ernie Simms</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Moody">Herbert Moody</a> and <a href="Steve%20Howard">Steve Howard</a>, have scored more than 100 goals for Luton.

The first player to be <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">capped</a> while playing for Luton was left winger <a href="Robert%20Hawkes">Robert Hawkes</a>, who took to the field for <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> against <a href="Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29">Ireland</a> at <a href="Goodison%20Park">Goodison Park</a> on 16 February 1907.

Payne also holds the Football League record for the most goals in a game—he hit 10 past <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a> on 13 April 1936.

The club's largest wins have been a 15–0 victory over <a href="Great%20Yarmouth%20Town%20F.C.">Great Yarmouth Town</a> on 21 November 1914 in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> and a 12–0 win over <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a> in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> on 13 April 1936.

Lung cancer

Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant <a href="lung%20tumor">lung tumor</a> characterized by uncontrolled <a href="cell%20growth">cell growth</a> in <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a> of the <a href="lung">lung</a>. This <a href="neoplasm">growth</a> can spread beyond the lung by the process of <a href="metastasis">metastasis</a> into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most <a href="cancer">cancer</a>s that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are <a href="carcinomas">carcinomas</a>. The two main types are <a href="small-cell%20lung%20carcinoma">small-cell lung carcinoma</a> (SCLC) and <a href="non-small-cell%20lung%20carcinoma">non-small-cell lung carcinoma</a> (NSCLC). The most common <a href="symptom">symptom</a>s are coughing (including <a href="Hemoptysis">coughing up blood</a>), weight loss, shortness of breath, and <a href="chest%20pain">chest pain</a>s.
The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term <a href="tobacco%20smoking">tobacco smoking</a>. About 10–15% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of <a href="genetics">genetic factors</a> and exposure to <a href="radon">radon</a> gas, <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a>, <a href="passive%20smoking">second-hand smoke</a>, or other forms of <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a>. Lung cancer may be seen on <a href="chest%20radiograph">chest radiograph</a>s and <a href="computed%20tomography">computed tomography</a> (CT) scans. The <a href="medical%20diagnosis">diagnosis</a> is confirmed by <a href="biopsy">biopsy</a> which is usually performed by <a href="bronchoscopy">bronchoscopy</a> or CT-guidance.
Avoidance of risk factors, including smoking and air pollution, is the primary method of prevention. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the <a href="staging%20%28pathology%29">stage</a> (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include <a href="surgery">surgery</a>, <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>, and <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiotherapy</a>. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a>. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer <a href="Five-year%20survival%20rate">survive five years</a> after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world.
Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include:

If the cancer grows in the <a href="airway">airway</a>s, it may obstruct airflow, causing breathing difficulties. The obstruction can lead to accumulation of secretions behind the blockage, and predispose to <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>.

Depending on the type of tumor, <a href="Paraneoplastic%20syndrome">paraneoplastic phenomena</a>—symptoms not due to the local presence of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include <a href="hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</a>, <a href="syndrome%20of%20inappropriate%20antidiuretic%20hormone">syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone</a> (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic <a href="ACTH">ACTH</a> production, or <a href="Lambert%E2%80%93Eaton%20myasthenic%20syndrome">Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome</a> (muscle weakness due to <a href="autoimmune%20disorder">autoantibodies</a>). Tumors in the <a href="Apex%20of%20lung">top of the lung</a>, known as <a href="Pancoast%20tumor">Pancoast tumor</a>s, may invade the local part of the <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system">sympathetic nervous system</a>, leading to <a href="Horner%27s%20syndrome">Horner's syndrome</a> (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the <a href="brachial%20plexus">brachial plexus</a>.

Many of the symptoms of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention. Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, <a href="syncope%20%28medicine%29">fainting</a>, <a href="convulsion">convulsion</a>s, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, <a href="adrenal%20gland">adrenal gland</a>s, opposite lung, <a href="liver">liver</a>, <a href="pericardium">pericardium</a>, and <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are <a href="Incidental%20imaging%20finding">incidentally</a> found on routine <a href="chest%20radiograph">chest radiograph</a>y.

Cancer develops after <a href="genetic%20damage">genetic damage</a> to <a href="DNA">DNA</a> and <a href="Epigenetics">epigenetic</a> changes. Those changes affect the <a href="Cell%20biology">cell's normal functions</a>, including <a href="cell%20proliferation">cell proliferation</a>, programmed cell death (<a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a>), and <a href="DNA%20repair">DNA repair</a>. As more damage accumulates, the risk of cancer increases.

<a href="Tobacco%20smoking">Tobacco smoking</a> is by far the main contributor to lung cancer. Cigarette smoke contains at least <a href="list%20of%20cigarette%20smoke%20carcinogens">73 known carcinogens</a>, including <a href="benzo%28a%29pyrene">benzo["a"]pyrene</a>, <a href="NNK">NNK</a>, <a href="1%2C3-butadiene">1,3-butadiene</a>, and a <a href="radioisotope">radioactive isotope</a> of polonium – <a href="polonium-210">polonium-210</a>. Across the developed world, 90% of lung cancer deaths in men and 70% of those in women during the year 2000 were attributed to smoking. Smoking accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases.

<a href="Passive%20smoking">Passive smoking</a> – the inhalation of smoke from another's smoking – is a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker can be defined as someone either living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe, and the UK have consistently shown a significantly-increased risk among those exposed to passive smoking. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of <a href="sidestream%20smoke">sidestream smoke</a> suggest that it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking results in roughly 3,400 lung cancer-related deaths each year in the U.S.

<a href="Cannabis%20smoking">Marijuana smoke</a> contains many of the same <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>s as those in tobacco smoke. However, the effect of smoking <a href="cannabis">cannabis</a> on lung cancer risk is not clear. A 2013 review did not find an increased risk from light to moderate use. A 2014 review found that smoking cannabis doubled the risk of lung cancer.

<a href="Radon">Radon</a> is a colorless and odorless <a href="gas">gas</a> generated by the breakdown of radioactive <a href="radium">radium</a>, which in turn is the decay product of <a href="uranium">uranium</a>, found in the Earth's <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29">crust</a>. The radiation decay products <a href="ion">ion</a>ize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes become cancerous. Radon is the second-most common cause of lung cancer in the US, causing about 21,000 deaths each year. The risk increases 8–16% for every 100 <a href="becquerel">Bq</a>/<a href="cubic%20metre">m³</a> increase in the radon concentration. Radon gas levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil and rocks. About one in 15 homes in the US have radon levels above the recommended guideline of 4 <a href="picocurie">picocurie</a>s per liter (pCi/l) (148 Bq/m³).

<a href="Asbestos">Asbestos</a> can cause a variety of lung diseases such as lung cancer. <a href="Tobacco">Tobacco</a> smoking and asbestos both have <a href="synergy">synergistic</a> effects on the development of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the <a href="pleura">pleura</a>, called <a href="mesothelioma">mesothelioma</a> – which actually is different from lung cancer.

<a href="Air%20pollution">Outdoor air pollutants</a>, especially chemicals released from the burning of <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a>s, increase the risk of lung cancer. Fine <a href="Atmospheric%20particulate%20matter">particulates</a> (PM) and <a href="stratospheric%20sulfur%20aerosols">sulfate aerosols</a>, which may be released in traffic <a href="Exhaust%20gas">exhaust fumes</a>, are associated with a slightly-increased risk. For <a href="nitrogen%20dioxide">nitrogen dioxide</a>, an incremental increase of 10 <a href="parts%20per%20billion">parts per billion</a> increases the risk of lung cancer by 14%. Outdoor air pollution is estimated to cause 1–2% of lung cancers.

Tentative evidence supports an increased risk of lung cancer from <a href="indoor%20air%20pollution">indoor air pollution</a> in relation to the burning of <a href="Wood%20fuel">wood</a>, <a href="Charcoal-burning">charcoal</a>, dung, or crop residue for cooking and heating. Women who are exposed to indoor coal smoke have roughly twice the risk, and many of the by-products of burning <a href="biomass">biomass</a> are known or suspected carcinogens. This risk affects about 2.4 billion people worldwide, and it is believed to result in 1.5% of lung cancer deaths.

About 8% of lung cancer is caused by <a href="heredity">inherited</a> factors. In relatives of people that are diagnosed with lung cancer, the risk is doubled, likely due to a <a href="polygenic%20disorder">combination of genes</a>. <a href="Genetic%20polymorphism">Polymorphisms</a> on <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s 5, 6, and 15 are known to affect the risk of lung cancer. <a href="Single-nucleotide%20polymorphism">Single-nucleotide polymorphism</a>s (SNPs) of the genes encoding the <a href="nicotinic%20acetylcholine%20receptor">nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</a> (nAChR) – "<a href="CHRNA5">CHRNA5</a>", "<a href="CHRNA3">CHRNA3</a>", and "<a href="CHRNB4">CHRNB4</a>" – are of those associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, as well as "<a href="RGS17">RGS17</a>" – a gene regulating <a href="G%20protein%23Signaling">G-protein signaling</a>.

Numerous other substances, occupations, and environmental exposures have been linked to lung cancer. The <a href="International%20Agency%20for%20Research%20on%20Cancer">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a> (IARC) states that there is some "sufficient evidence" to show that the following are carcinogenic in the lungs:

Similar to many other cancers, lung cancer is initiated by either the activation of <a href="oncogene">oncogene</a>s or the inactivation of <a href="tumor%20suppressor%20gene">tumor suppressor gene</a>s. Carcinogens cause mutations in these genes that induce the development of cancer.

<a href="Mutation">Mutation</a>s in the "<a href="Ras%20%28protein%29">K-ras</a>" proto-oncogene cause roughly 10–30% of lung <a href="adenocarcinoma">adenocarcinoma</a>s. Nearly 4% of non-small-cell lung carcinomas involve an <a href="EML4-ALK%20positive%20lung%20cancer">EML4-ALK</a> <a href="tyrosine%20kinase">tyrosine kinase</a> <a href="fusion%20gene">fusion gene</a>.

<a href="Epigenetics">Epigenetic</a> changes such as alteration of <a href="DNA%20methylation">DNA methylation</a>, <a href="histone">histone</a> tail modification, or <a href="microRNA">microRNA</a> regulation may result in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Importantly, cancer cells develop resistance to <a href="oxidative%20stress">oxidative stress</a>, which enables them to withstand and exacerbate <a href="Inflammation">inflammatory</a> conditions that inhibit the activity of the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> against the tumor.

The <a href="epidermal%20growth%20factor%20receptor">epidermal growth factor receptor</a> (EGFR) regulates cell proliferation, <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a>, <a href="angiogenesis">angiogenesis</a>, and tumor invasion. Mutations and <a href="Amplification%20of%20DNA">amplification</a> of EGFR are common in non-small-cell lung carcinoma, and they provide the basis for treatment with EGFR-inhibitors. "<a href="Her2/neu">Her2/neu</a>" is affected less frequently. Other genes that are often mutated or amplified include "<a href="c-MET">c-MET</a>", "<a href="NKX2-1">NKX2-1</a>", "<a href="LKB1">LKB1</a>", "<a href="PIK3CA">PIK3CA</a>", and "<a href="BRAF%20%28gene%29">BRAF</a>".

The <a href="Cell%20lineage">cell lines</a> of origin are not fully understood. The mechanism may involve the abnormal activation of <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a>s. In the proximal airways, stem cells that express <a href="keratin%205">keratin 5</a> are more likely to be affected, typically leading to <a href="Squamous%20cell%20lung%20carcinoma">squamous-cell lung carcinoma</a>. In the middle airways, implicated stem cells include <a href="club%20cell">club cell</a>s and <a href="neuroepithelial%20cell">neuroepithelial cell</a>s that express <a href="uteroglobin">club cell secretory protein</a>. Small-cell lung carcinoma may originate from these cell lines or <a href="neuroendocrine%20cell">neuroendocrine cell</a>s, and it may express <a href="CD44">CD44</a>.

<a href="Metastasis">Metastasis</a> of lung cancer requires <a href="Epithelial%E2%80%93mesenchymal%20transition">transition</a> from <a href="Epithelium">epithelial</a> to <a href="mesenchyme">mesenchymal</a> cell type. This may occur through the activation of signaling pathways such as <a href="Protein%20kinase%20B">Akt</a>/<a href="GSK3B">GSK3B</a>eta, <a href="MAPK/ERK%20pathway">MEK-ERK</a>, <a href="Fas%20receptor">Fas</a>, and Par6.

Performing a <a href="chest%20radiograph">chest radiograph</a> is one of the first investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may be suggestive of lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, the widening of the <a href="mediastinum">mediastinum</a> (suggestive of spread to <a href="lymph%20node">lymph node</a>s there), <a href="atelectasis">atelectasis</a> (lung collapse), consolidation (<a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>), or <a href="pleural%20effusion">pleural effusion</a>. <a href="X-ray%20computed%20tomography">CT imaging</a> is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. <a href="Bronchoscopy">Bronchoscopic</a> or CT-guided <a href="biopsy">biopsy</a> is often used to sample the tumor for <a href="histopathology">histopathology</a>.

Lung cancer often appears as a <a href="solitary%20pulmonary%20nodule">solitary pulmonary nodule</a> on a chest radiograph. However, the <a href="differential%20diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a> is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, <a href="hamartoma">hamartoma</a>s, and infectious <a href="granuloma">granuloma</a>s caused by <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, <a href="histoplasmosis">histoplasmosis</a> or <a href="coccidioidomycosis">coccidioidomycosis</a>. Lung cancer can also be an <a href="incidentaloma">incidental finding</a>, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason. The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on the <a href="histopathology">histological</a> examination of the suspicious tissue in the context of the clinical and radiological features.

<a href="Clinical%20practice%20guideline">Clinical practice guideline</a>s recommend frequencies for pulmonary nodule surveillance. CT imaging should not be used for longer or more frequently than indicated, as the extended <a href="Disease%20surveillance">surveillance</a> exposes people to increased radiation and is costly.

Lung cancers are classified according to <a href="histopathology">histological type</a>. This classification is important for determining both the management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are <a href="carcinoma">carcinoma</a>s – malignancies that arise from <a href="epithelial%20cell">epithelial cell</a>s. Lung carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a <a href="microscope">microscope</a>. For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: <a href="non-small-cell%20lung%20carcinoma">non-small-cell lung carcinoma</a> and <a href="small-cell%20lung%20carcinoma">small-cell lung carcinoma</a>.

The three main subtypes of NSCLC are <a href="Adenocarcinoma%20of%20the%20lung">adenocarcinoma</a>, <a href="squamous-cell%20lung%20carcinoma">squamous-cell carcinoma</a>, and <a href="large-cell%20lung%20carcinoma">large-cell carcinoma</a>.

Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma, which usually comes from peripheral lung tissue. Although most cases of adenocarcinoma are associated with smoking, adenocarcinoma is also the most-common form of lung cancer among people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes ("never-smokers") and ex-smokers with a modest smoking history. A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the <a href="bronchioloalveolar%20carcinoma">bronchioloalveolar carcinoma</a>, is more common in female never-smokers, and may have a better long-term survival.

Squamous-cell carcinoma causes about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. A hollow cavity and associated <a href="necrosis">cell death</a> are commonly found at the center of the tumor.

Nearly 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These are so named because the cancer cells are large, with excess <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a>, large <a href="cell%20nucleus">nuclei</a>, and conspicuous <a href="nucleolus">nucleoli</a>.

In SCLC, the cells contain dense neurosecretory granules (<a href="vesicle%20%28biology%29">vesicles</a> containing <a href="neuroendocrine">neuroendocrine</a> <a href="hormone">hormone</a>s), which give this tumor an endocrine or <a href="paraneoplastic%20syndrome">paraneoplastic syndrome</a> association. Most cases arise in the larger airways (primary and secondary <a href="bronchus">bronchi</a>). Sixty to seventy percent have extensive disease (which cannot be targeted within a single radiation therapy field) at presentation.

Four main histological subtypes are recognised, although some cancers may contain a combination of different subtypes, such as adenosquamous carcinoma. Rare subtypes include <a href="lung%20carcinoid">carcinoid tumors</a>, bronchial gland carcinomas, and <a href="Sarcomatoid%20carcinoma%20of%20the%20lung">sarcomatoid carcinomas</a>.

The lungs are a common place for the spread of tumors from other parts of the body. Secondary cancers are classified by the site of origin; for example, <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a> that has been spread to the lung is called metastatic breast cancer. Metastases often have a characteristic round appearance on chest radiograph.

Primary lung cancers also most commonly metastasize to the brain, bones, liver, and <a href="adrenal%20gland">adrenal gland</a>s. <a href="Immunostaining">Immunostaining</a> of a biopsy usually helps determine the original source. The presence of <a href="Napsin-A">Napsin-A</a>, <a href="TTF-1">TTF-1</a>, <a href="CK7">CK7</a>, and <a href="CK20">CK20</a> help confirm the subtype of lung carcinoma. SCLC that originates from <a href="neuroendocrine%20cell">neuroendocrine cell</a>s may express <a href="CD56">CD56</a>, <a href="neural%20cell%20adhesion%20molecule">neural cell adhesion molecule</a>, <a href="synaptophysin">synaptophysin</a>, or <a href="chromogranin">chromogranin</a>.

Lung <a href="cancer%20staging">cancer staging</a> is an assessment of the degree of spread of the cancer from its original source. It is one of the factors affecting both the <a href="prognosis">prognosis</a> and the potential treatment of lung cancer.

The evaluation of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) staging uses the <a href="TNM%20staging%20system">TNM classification</a> (tumor, node, metastasis). This is based on the size of the primary tumor, lymph node involvement, and distant metastasis.

Using the TNM descriptors, a group is assigned, ranging from occult cancer, through stages 0, IA (one-A), IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IV (four). This stage group assists with the choice of treatment and estimation of prognosis.

SCLC has traditionally been classified as "limited stage" (confined to one-half of the chest and within the scope of a single tolerable <a href="radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> field) or "extensive stage" (more widespread disease). However, the TNM classification and grouping are useful in estimating prognosis.

For both NSCLC and SCLC, the two general types of staging evaluations are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed before definitive surgery. It is based on the results of imaging studies (such as <a href="X-ray%20computed%20tomography">CT scans</a> and <a href="positron%20emission%20tomography">PET scans</a>) and biopsy results. Surgical staging is evaluated either during or after the operation. It is based on the combined results of surgical and clinical findings, including surgical sampling of thoracic lymph nodes.

<a href="Smoking%20prevention">Smoking prevention</a> and <a href="smoking%20cessation">smoking cessation</a> are effective ways of preventing the development of lung cancer.

While in most countries industrial and domestic carcinogens have been identified and banned, tobacco smoking is still widespread. Eliminating tobacco smoking is a primary goal in the prevention of lung cancer, and smoking cessation is an important preventive tool in this process.

Policy interventions to decrease <a href="passive%20smoking">passive smoking</a> in public areas such as restaurants and workplaces have become more common in many <a href="Western%20world">Western countries</a>. <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> has had a complete smoking ban since 2005 while India introduced a ban on smoking in public in October 2008. The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> has called for governments to institute a total ban on tobacco advertising to prevent young people from taking up smoking. They assess that such bans have reduced tobacco consumption by 16% where instituted.

<a href="Cancer%20screening">Cancer screening</a> uses <a href="medical%20test">medical test</a>s to detect disease in large groups of people who have no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, <a href="computed%20tomography">computed tomography</a> (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to it in a way that prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an <a href="Absolute%20risk%20reduction">absolute amount</a> of 0.3% (<a href="Relative%20risk%20reduction">relative amount</a> of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.

CT screening is associated with a high rate of <a href="False%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives">falsely positive</a> tests which may result in unneeded treatment. For each true positive scan there are about 19 falsely positives scans. Other concerns include <a href="Ionizing%20radiation">radiation exposure</a> and the cost of testing along with follow up. Research has not found two other available tests—<a href="sputum">sputum</a> <a href="cytopathology">cytology</a> or <a href="chest%20radiograph">chest radiograph</a> (CXR) screening tests—to have any benefit.

The <a href="United%20States%20Preventive%20Services%20Task%20Force">United States Preventive Services Task Force</a> (USPSTF) recommends yearly screening using low-dose computed tomography in those who have a total smoking history of 30 <a href="pack-year">pack-year</a>s and are between 55 and 80 years old until a person has not been smoking for more than 15 years. Screening should not be done in those with other health problems that would make treatment of lung cancer if found not an option. The <a href="National%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29">English National Health Service</a> was in 2014 re-examining the evidence for screening.

The long-term use of supplemental <a href="vitamin%20A">vitamin A</a>, <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>, <a href="vitamin%20D">vitamin D</a> or <a href="vitamin%20E">vitamin E</a> does not reduce the risk of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people who eat diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk, but this may be due to <a href="confounding">confounding</a>—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit and vegetables diet with less smoking. Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk, although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.

Treatment for lung cancer depends on the cancer's specific cell type, how far it has <a href="cancer%20staging">spread</a>, and the person's <a href="performance%20status">performance status</a>. Common treatments include <a href="palliative%20care">palliative care</a>, <a href="surgery">surgery</a>, <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>, and <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a>. <a href="Targeted%20therapy%20of%20lung%20cancer">Targeted therapy of lung cancer</a> is growing in importance for advanced lung cancer.

If investigations confirm NSCLC, the <a href="cancer%20staging">stage</a> is assessed to determine whether the disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread to the point where it cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and <a href="positron%20emission%20tomography">positron emission tomography</a> are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic <a href="needle%20aspiration">needle aspiration</a>, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without <a href="endobronchial%20ultrasound">endobronchial ultrasound</a>), <a href="endoscopic%20ultrasound">endoscopic ultrasound</a> with needle aspiration, <a href="mediastinoscopy">mediastinoscopy</a>, and <a href="thoracoscopy">thoracoscopy</a>. <a href="Blood%20test">Blood test</a>s and <a href="pulmonary%20function%20testing">pulmonary function testing</a> are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.

In most cases of early-stage NSCLC, removal of a lobe of lung (<a href="lobectomy">lobectomy</a>) is the surgical treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (<a href="wedge%20resection">wedge resection</a>) may be performed. However, wedge resection has a higher risk of recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive <a href="iodine">iodine</a> <a href="brachytherapy">brachytherapy</a> at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (<a href="pneumonectomy">pneumonectomy</a>) is performed. <a href="Video-assisted%20thoracoscopic%20surgery">Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery</a> (VATS) and <a href="VATS%20lobectomy">VATS lobectomy</a> use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.

In SCLC, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is typically used. However the role of surgery in SCLC is being reconsidered. Surgery might improve outcomes when added to chemotherapy and radiation in early stage SCLC.

<a href="Radiation%20therapy">Radiotherapy</a> is often given together with chemotherapy, and may be used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who are not eligible for surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period. Postoperative (<a href="Adjuvant%20therapy">adjuvant</a>) thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative-intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.

For potentially curable SCLC cases, chest radiotherapy is often recommended in addition to chemotherapy.
If cancer growth blocks a short section of bronchus, <a href="brachytherapy">brachytherapy</a> (localized radiotherapy) may be given directly inside the airway to open the passage. Compared to <a href="external%20beam%20radiotherapy">external beam radiotherapy</a>, brachytherapy allows a reduction in treatment time and reduced radiation exposure to healthcare staff. Evidence for brachytherapy, however, is less than that for external beam radiotherapy.

<a href="Prophylactic%20cranial%20irradiation">Prophylactic cranial irradiation</a> (PCI) is a type of radiotherapy to the brain, used to reduce the risk of <a href="metastasis">metastasis</a>. PCI is most useful in SCLC. In limited-stage disease, PCI increases three-year survival from 15% to 20%; in extensive disease, one-year survival increases from 13% to 27%.

Recent improvements in targeting and imaging have led to the development of stereotactic radiation in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. In this form of radiotherapy, high doses are delivered over a number of sessions using stereotactic targeting techniques. Its use is primarily in patients who are not surgical candidates due to medical <a href="comorbidities">comorbidities</a>.

For both NSCLC and SCLC patients, smaller doses of radiation to the chest may be used for symptom control (<a href="palliative%20care">palliative</a> radiotherapy).

The <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> regimen depends on the tumor type. SCLC, even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, <a href="cisplatin">cisplatin</a> and <a href="etoposide">etoposide</a> are most commonly used. Combinations with <a href="carboplatin">carboplatin</a>, <a href="gemcitabine">gemcitabine</a>, <a href="paclitaxel">paclitaxel</a>, <a href="vinorelbine">vinorelbine</a>, <a href="topotecan">topotecan</a>, and <a href="irinotecan">irinotecan</a> are also used. In advanced NSCLC, chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often <a href="Platinum-based%20antineoplastic">platinum-based</a> (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, <a href="docetaxel">docetaxel</a>, <a href="pemetrexed">pemetrexed</a>, etoposide or vinorelbine. Platinum-based drugs and combinations that include platinum therapy may lead to a higher risk of serious adverse effects in people over 70 years old.

<a href="Adjuvant%20chemotherapy">Adjuvant chemotherapy</a> refers to the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby <a href="lymph%20node">lymph node</a>s during surgery to assist <a href="lung%20cancer%20staging">staging</a>. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy (including or not including postoperative radiotherapy) improves survival by 4% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a>s have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. <a href="Neoadjuvant%20chemotherapy">Chemotherapy before surgery</a> in NSCLC that can be removed surgically may improve outcomes.

Chemotherapy may be combined with <a href="palliative%20care">palliative care</a> in the treatment of the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving <a href="Quality%20of%20life%20%28healthcare%29">quality of life</a>. With adequate <a href="Performance%20status">physical fitness</a> maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.

Several drugs that <a href="targeted%20therapy%20of%20lung%20cancer">target molecular pathways</a> in lung cancer are available, especially for the treatment of advanced disease. <a href="Erlotinib">Erlotinib</a>, <a href="gefitinib">gefitinib</a> and <a href="afatinib">afatinib</a> inhibit <a href="tyrosine%20kinase">tyrosine kinase</a> at the <a href="epidermal%20growth%20factor%20receptor">epidermal growth factor receptor</a>. <a href="Denosumab">Denosumab</a> is a <a href="monoclonal%20antibody">monoclonal antibody</a> directed against <a href="RANKL">receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand</a>. It may be useful in the treatment of <a href="Bone%20metastasis">bone metastases</a>.

Several treatments can be administered via bronchoscopy for the management of airway obstruction or bleeding. If an airway becomes obstructed by cancer growth, options include rigid bronchoscopy, balloon bronchoplasty, stenting, and microdebridement. Laser photosection involves the delivery of laser light inside the airway via a bronchoscope to remove the obstructing tumor.

<a href="Palliative%20care">Palliative care</a> when added to usual cancer care benefits people even when they are still receiving chemotherapy. These approaches allow additional discussion of treatment options and provide opportunities to arrive at well-considered decisions. Palliative care may avoid unhelpful but expensive care not only at the end of life, but also throughout the course of the illness. For individuals who have more advanced disease, <a href="hospice%20care">hospice care</a> may also be appropriate.

Of all people with lung cancer in the US, 16.8% survive for at least five years after diagnosis. In England and Wales, between 2010 and 2011, overall <a href="Five-year%20survival%20rate">five-year survival</a> for lung cancer was estimated at 9.5%. Outcomes are generally worse in the <a href="developing%20world">developing world</a>. Stage is often advanced at the time of diagnosis. At presentation, 30–40% of cases of NSCLC are stage IV, and 60% of SCLC are stage IV. Survival for lung cancer falls as the stage at diagnosis becomes more advanced: the English data suggest that around 70% of patients survive at least a year when diagnosed at the earliest stage, but this falls to just 14% for those diagnosed with the most advanced disease (stage IV).

Prognostic factors in NSCLC include presence of pulmonary symptoms, large tumor size (>3 cm), non-squamous cell type (histology), degree of spread (stage) and metastases to multiple lymph nodes, and <a href="vascular%20invasion">vascular invasion</a>. For people with inoperable disease, outcomes are worse in those with poor <a href="performance%20status">performance status</a> and weight loss of more than 10%. Prognostic factors in small cell lung cancer include performance status, biological sex, stage of disease, and involvement of the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a> or <a href="liver">liver</a> at the time of diagnosis.

For NSCLC, the best prognosis is achieved with complete surgical resection of stage IA disease, with up to 70% five-year survival. People with extensive-stage SCLC have an average five-year survival rate of less than 1%. The average survival time for limited-stage disease is 20 months, with a five-year survival rate of 20%.

According to data provided by the <a href="National%20Cancer%20Institute">National Cancer Institute</a>, the median age at diagnosis of lung cancer in the US is 70 years, and the median age at death is 72 years. In the US, people with <a href="Health%20insurance">medical insurance</a> are more likely to have a better outcome.

Worldwide, lung cancer is the most-common cancer among men in terms of both <a href="Incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">incidence</a> and <a href="Mortality%20rate">mortality</a>, and among women has the third-highest incidence, and is second after breast cancer in mortality. In 2012, there were 1.82 million new cases worldwide, and 1.56 million deaths due to lung cancer, representing 19.4% of all deaths from cancer. The highest rates are in North America, Europe, and East Asia, with over a third of new cases in China that year. Rates in Africa and South Asia are much lower.

The population segment that is most likely to develop lung cancer is people aged over 50 who have a history of smoking. Unlike the mortality rate in men – which began declining more than 20 years ago, women's lung cancer mortality rates have risen over the last decades, and are just recently beginning to stabilize. In the US, the <a href="lifetime%20risk">lifetime risk</a> of developing lung cancer is 8% in men and 6% in women.

For every 3–4 million cigarettes smoked, one lung cancer death can occur. The influence of "<a href="Big%20Tobacco">Big Tobacco</a>" plays a significant role in smoking. Young nonsmokers who see <a href="Nicotine%20marketing">tobacco advertisements</a> are more likely to smoke. The role of passive smoking is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for lung cancer, resulting in policy interventions to decrease the undesired exposure of nonsmokers to others' tobacco smoke.

In the US, both black men and black women have a higher incidence. Lung cancer rates are currently lower in developing countries. With increased smoking in developing countries, the rates are expected to increase in the next few years, notably in both China and India.

Also in the US, military veterans have a 25–50% higher rate of lung cancer primarily due to higher rates of smoking. During World War II and the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, asbestos also played a role, and <a href="Agent%20Orange">Agent Orange</a> may have caused some problems during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

Lung cancer is the third most-common cancer in the UK (around 46,400 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2014), and it is the most common cause of cancer-related death (around 35,900 people died in 2014).

From the 1960s, the rates of lung adenocarcinoma started to rise in relation to other kinds of lung cancer, partially due to the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a>, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continue to rise.

Lung cancer was uncommon before the advent of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at <a href="autopsy">autopsy</a> in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In <a href="Germany">Germany</a> in 1929, physician <a href="Fritz%20Lickint">Fritz Lickint</a> recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to an aggressive <a href="Anti-tobacco%20movement%20in%20Nazi%20Germany">antismoking campaign</a>. The <a href="British%20Doctors%20Study">British Doctors' Study</a>, published in the 1950s, was the first solid <a href="epidemiology">epidemiological</a> evidence of the link between lung cancer and smoking. As a result, in 1964 the <a href="Surgeon%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Surgeon General of the United States</a> recommended smokers should stop smoking.

The connection with <a href="radon">radon</a> gas was first recognized among miners in the <a href="Ore%20Mountains%20%28Germany%29">Ore Mountains</a> near <a href="Schneeberg%2C%20Saxony">Schneeberg, Saxony</a>. <a href="Silver">Silver</a> has been mined there since 1470, and these mines are rich in <a href="uranium">uranium</a>, with its accompanying <a href="radium">radium</a> and radon gas. Miners developed a disproportionate amount of lung disease, eventually recognized as lung cancer in the 1870s. Despite this discovery, mining continued into the 1950s, due to the <a href="USSR">USSR</a>'s demand for uranium. Radon was confirmed as a cause of lung cancer in the 1960s.

The first successful <a href="pneumonectomy">pneumonectomy</a> for lung cancer was performed in 1933. Palliative radiotherapy has been used since the 1940s. Radical radiotherapy, initially used in the 1950s, was an attempt to use larger radiation doses in patients with relatively early-stage lung cancer, but who were otherwise unfit for surgery. In 1997, CHART was seen as an improvement over conventional radical radiotherapy. With SCLC, initial attempts in the 1960s at surgical resection and radical radiotherapy were unsuccessful. In the 1970s, successful chemotherapy regimens were developed.

Current research directions for lung cancer treatment include <a href="immunotherapy">immunotherapy</a>, which encourages the body's immune system to attack the tumor cells, epigenetics, and new combinations of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, both on their own and together. Many of these new treatments work through <a href="immune%20checkpoint%20blockade">immune checkpoint blockade</a>, disrupting cancer's ability to evade the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>.

<a href="Ipilimumab">Ipilimumab</a> blocks <a href="Signal%20transduction">signaling</a> through a <a href="Receptor%20%28biochemistry%29">receptor</a> on <a href="T%20cells">T cells</a> known as <a href="CTLA-4">CTLA-4</a> which dampens down the immune system. It has been approved by the US <a href="U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) for treatment of <a href="melanoma">melanoma</a> and is undergoing clinical trials for both NSCLC and SCLC.

Other immunotherapy treatments interfere with the binding of <a href="programmed%20cell%20death%201">programmed cell death 1</a> (PD-1) protein with its <a href="ligand">ligand</a> <a href="programmed%20cell%20death%201%20ligand%201">PD-1 ligand 1</a> (PD-L1), and have been approved as first- and subsequent-line treatments for various subsets of lung cancers. Signaling through PD-1 inactivates T cells. Some cancer cells appear to exploit this by expressing PD-L1 in order to switch off T cells that might recognise them as a threat. Monoclonal antibodies targeting both PD-1 and PD-L1, such as <a href="pembrolizumab">pembrolizumab</a>, <a href="nivolumab">nivolumab</a>, <a href="atezolizumab">atezolizumab</a>, and <a href="durvalumab">durvalumab</a> are currently in clinical trials for treatment for lung cancer.

Epigenetics is the study of small, usually heritable, molecular modifications—or "tags"—that bind to DNA and modify <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a> levels. Targeting these tags with drugs can kill cancer cells. Early-stage research in NSCLC using drugs aimed at epigenetic modifications shows that blocking more than one of these tags can kill cancer cells with fewer side effects. Studies also show that giving patients these drugs before standard treatment can improve its effectiveness. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate how well these drugs kill lung cancer cells in humans. Several drugs that target epigenetic mechanisms are in development. <a href="Histone%20deacetylase%20inhibitor">Histone deacetylase inhibitor</a>s in development include <a href="valproic%20acid">valproic acid</a>, <a href="vorinostat">vorinostat</a>, <a href="belinostat">belinostat</a>, <a href="panobinostat">panobinostat</a>, <a href="entinostat">entinostat</a>, and <a href="romidepsin">romidepsin</a>. <a href="DNA%20methyltransferase">DNA methyltransferase</a> inhibitors in development include <a href="decitabine">decitabine</a>, <a href="azacitidine">azacytidine</a>, and <a href="hydralazine">hydralazine</a>.

The TRACERx project is looking at how NSCLC develops and evolves, and how these tumors become resistant to treatment. The project will look at tumor samples from 850 NSCLC patients at various stages including diagnosis, after first treatment, post-treatment, and relapse. By studying samples at different points of tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The results of this project will help scientists and doctors gain a better understanding of NSCLC and potentially lead to the development of new treatments for the disease.

For lung cancer cases that develop resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and <a href="anaplastic%20lymphoma%20kinase">anaplastic lymphoma kinase</a> (ALK) <a href="Kinase%20tyrosine-based%20inhibitory%20motif">tyrosine kinase inhibitors</a>, new drugs are in development. New EGFR inhibitors include <a href="afatinib">afatinib</a> and <a href="dacomitinib">dacomitinib</a>. An alternative signaling pathway, <a href="c-Met">c-Met</a>, can be inhibited by <a href="tivantinib">tivantinib</a> and <a href="onartuzumab">onartuzumab</a>. New ALK inhibitors include <a href="crizotinib">crizotinib</a> and <a href="ceritinib">ceritinib</a>. If the <a href="MAPK/ERK%20pathway">MAPK/ERK pathway</a> is involved, the <a href="BRAF%20%28gene%29">BRAF</a> kinase inhibitor <a href="dabrafenib">dabrafenib</a> and the MAPK/MEK inhibitor <a href="trametinib">trametinib</a> may be beneficial.

Lung <a href="cancer%20stem%20cell">cancer stem cell</a>s are often resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This may lead to relapse after treatment. New approaches target <a href="protein">protein</a> or <a href="glycoprotein">glycoprotein</a> markers that are specific to the stem cells. Such markers include <a href="CD133">CD133</a>, <a href="CD90">CD90</a>, <a href="ALDH1A1">ALDH1A1</a>, <a href="CD44">CD44</a> and <a href="ABCG2">ABCG2</a>. <a href="Cell%20signaling">Signaling pathways</a> such as <a href="Hedgehog%20signaling%20pathway">Hedgehog</a>, <a href="Wnt%20signaling%20pathway">Wnt</a> and <a href="Notch%20signaling%20pathway">Notch</a> are often implicated in the self-renewal of stem cell lines. Thus treatments targeting these pathways may help to prevent relapse.

Laurence of Canterbury

Laurence (died 2 February 619) was the second <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> from about 604 to 619. He was a member of the <a href="Gregorian%20mission">Gregorian mission</a> sent from Italy to England to <a href="Christianization">Christianise</a> the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> from their native <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">Anglo-Saxon paganism</a>, although the date of his arrival is disputed. He was <a href="Consecration">consecrated</a> archbishop by his predecessor, <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a>, during Augustine's lifetime, to ensure continuity in the office. While archbishop, he attempted unsuccessfully to resolve differences with the native British bishops by corresponding with them about points of dispute. Laurence faced a crisis following the death of King <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht of Kent</a>, when the king's successor abandoned Christianity; he eventually reconverted. Laurence was <a href="Canonization%23Historical%20development%20of%20the%20process">revered</a> as a saint after his death in 619.

Laurence was part of the Gregorian mission originally dispatched from Rome in 595 to convert the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism to Christianity; he landed at <a href="Thanet%20District">Thanet</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, with Augustine in 597, or, as some sources state, first arrived in 601 and was not a part of the first group of missionaries. He had been a monk in Rome before his travels to England, but nothing else is known of his history or background. The medieval chronicler <a href="Bede">Bede</a> says that Augustine sent Laurence back to Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Gregory I</a> to report on the success of converting King Æthelberht of Kent and to carry a letter with questions for the pope. Accompanied by <a href="Peter%20of%20Canterbury">Peter of Canterbury</a>, another missionary, he set off some time after July 598, and had returned by June 601. He brought back with him Gregory's replies to Augustine's questions, a document commonly known as the "<a href="Libellus%20responsionum">Libellus responsionum</a>", that Bede incorporated in his "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>". Laurence is probably the Laurence referred to in the letter from Gregory to <a href="Bertha%20of%20Kent">Bertha</a>, queen of Kent. In that letter, Gregory praises Bertha for her part in the conversion of her husband, details of which Gregory says he received from Laurence the priest. It is known that Laurence returned to England with <a href="Mellitus">Mellitus</a> and others of the second group of missionaries in the summer of 601, but there is no record of Peter being with them.

Laurence succeeded Augustine to the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">see of Canterbury</a> in about 604, and ruled until his death on 2 February 619. To secure the succession, Augustine had consecrated Laurence before he died, even though that was prohibited by <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>. Augustine was afraid though that if someone did not step into the office immediately, it would damage the missionary efforts in Britain. However, Laurence never received a <a href="pallium">pallium</a> from Rome, so he may have been considered uncanonical by the papacy. Bede makes a point of comparing Augustine's action in consecrating Laurence to Saint Peter's action of consecrating <a href="Pope%20Clement%20I">Clement</a> as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rome">Bishop of Rome</a> during Peter's lifetime, which the theologian <a href="J.%20Robert%20Wright">J. Robert Wright</a> believes may be Bede's way of criticising the practices of the church in his day.

In 610 Laurence received letters from Pope <a href="Pope%20Boniface%20IV">Boniface IV</a>, addressed to him as archbishop and Augustine's successor. The correspondence was in response to Laurence having sent Mellitus to Rome earlier in 610, to solicit advice from the papacy on matters concerning the English Church. While in Rome Mellitus attended a <a href="synod">synod</a>, and brought the synodical decrees back with him to Laurence.

In 613 Laurence consecrated the monastery church built by Augustine in Canterbury, and dedicated it to saints <a href="Saint%20Peter">Peter</a> and <a href="Saint%20Paul">Paul</a>; it was later re-consecrated as <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's Abbey</a>, Canterbury. Laurence also wrote to the bishops in the lands held by the <a href="Scoti">Scots</a> and by the <a href="Britons%20%28historical%29">Britons</a>, urging them to hold <a href="Easter">Easter</a> on the day that the Roman church celebrated it, instead of their traditional date, part of the <a href="Easter%20controversy%23Third_phase">Easter controversy</a>. The letter is also preserved in Bede's history. Laurence in 609 stated that <a href="Dagan%20%28bishop%29">Dagan</a>, a <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">native</a> bishop, would not eat with Laurence or share a roof with the archbishop, due to the differences between the two Churches.

Æthelberht died in 616, during Laurence's tenure; his son <a href="Eadbald%20of%20Kent">Eadbald</a> abandoned Christianity in favour of Anglo-Saxon paganism, forcing many of the Gregorian missionaries to flee the pagan backlash that followed Æthelberht's death. Among them in <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> were Mellitus, who was <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>, and <a href="Justus">Justus</a>, who was <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a>. Remaining in Britain, Laurence succeeded in reconverting Eadbald to Christianity. Bede relates the story that Laurence had been prepared to give up when he was visited by St Peter in a dream or vision. St Peter chastised Laurence and whipped him, and the marks of the whipping remained after the vision or dream ended. Laurence then displayed them to Eadbald, and the king was converted on the spot. Bede, however, hints that it was the death of some of the leaders of the pagan party in battle that really persuaded Laurence to stay. According to <a href="Benedicta%20Ward">Benedicta Ward</a>, a historian of Christianity, Bede uses the story of the whipping as an example of how suffering was a reminder of Christ's suffering for humans, and how that example could lead to conversion. Wright argues that another point Bede is making is that it is because of the intercession of <a href="St%20Peter">St Peter</a> himself that the mission continued. David Farmer, in the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20Saints">Oxford Dictionary of Saints</a>", suggests that the whipping story may have been a blending of the "<a href="Quo%20vadis">Quo Vadis</a>" story with some information given by <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> in a letter.

Modern historians have seen political overtones in the pagan reaction. The historian D. P. Kirby sees Eadbald's actions as a repudiation of his father's pro-<a href="Franks">Frankish</a> policies. <a href="Alcuin">Alcuin</a>, a later medieval writer, wrote that Laurence was "censured by apostolic authority". This may have been a letter from Pope <a href="Pope%20Adeodatus%20I">Adeodatus I</a>, commanding Laurence to stay in Kent. Kirby goes on to argue that it was Justus, not Laurence, who converted Eadbald, and this while Justus was archbishop, sometime around 624. Not all historians agree with this argument, however. <a href="Nicholas%20Brooks">Nicholas Brooks</a> states that the king was converted during Laurence's archiepiscopate, within a year of him succeeding his father. The historian <a href="Barbara%20Yorke">Barbara Yorke</a> argues that there were two co-rulers of Kent after Æthelberht's death, Eadbald and a Æthelwald, and that Eadbald was converted by Laurence while Æthelwald was converted by Justus after his return to Rochester. Another factor in the pagan reaction was Laurence's objection to Eadbald's marriage to his father's widow, something that Christians considered to be unlawful.

All efforts to extend the church beyond Kent encountered difficulties due to the attitude of King <a href="R%C3%A6dwald%20of%20East%20Anglia">Rædwald of East Anglia</a>, who had become the leading king in the south after Æthelberht's death. Rædwald was converted before the death of Æthelberht, perhaps at the urging of Æthelberht, but his kingdom was not, and Rædwald seems to have converted only to the extent of placing a Christian altar in his pagan temple. It proved impossible for Mellitus to return to London as bishop, although Justus did resume his duties at Rochester.

Laurence died on 2 February 619, and was buried in the abbey of St Peter and Paul in Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's; his <a href="relics">relics</a>, or remains, were moved, or <a href="Translation%20%28relics%29">translated</a>, to the new church of St Augustine's in 1091. His <a href="shrine">shrine</a> was in the axial chapel of the abbey church, flanking the shrine of Augustine, his predecessor. Laurence came to be regarded as a saint, and was given the <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints">feast day</a> of 3 February. The ninth century <a href="Stowe%20Missal">Stowe Missal</a> commemorates his feast day, along with Mellitus and Justus. A "<a href="Hagiography">Vita</a>" (or "Life") was written about the time of his translation, by <a href="Goscelin">Goscelin</a>, but it is mainly based on information in Bede. His tomb was opened in 1915. Besides his feast day, the date of his translation, 13 September, was also celebrated after his death. Laurence's tenure as archbishop is mainly remembered for his failure to secure a settlement with the Celtic church, and for his reconversion of Eadbald following Æthelbert's death. He was succeeded as archbishop by Mellitus, the Bishop of London.

<doc id="18739" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18739" title="Laika">
Laika

Laika (; c. 1954 – 3 November 1957) was a <a href="Soviet%20space%20dogs">Soviet space dog</a> who became one of the first <a href="animals%20in%20space">animals in space</a>, and the first animal to <a href="orbit">orbit</a> the Earth. Laika, a stray mongrel from the streets of <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, was selected to be the occupant of the Soviet spacecraft <a href="Sputnik%202">Sputnik 2</a> that was launched into outer space on 3 November 1957.

Little was known about the impact of <a href="spaceflight">spaceflight</a> on living creatures at the time of Laika's mission, and the technology to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so Laika's survival was never expected. Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space, so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor to human missions. The experiment aimed to prove that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure a <a href="micro-g%20environment">micro-g environment</a>, paving the way for <a href="human%20spaceflight">human spaceflight</a> and providing scientists with some of the first data on how living <a href="organism">organism</a>s react to spaceflight environments.

Laika died within hours from <a href="Hyperthermia">overheating</a>, possibly caused by a failure of the central <a href="R-7%20Semyorka">R-7 sustainer</a> to separate from the payload. The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or, as the Soviet government initially claimed, she was euthanised prior to <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> depletion.

On 11 April 2008, Russian officials unveiled a monument to Laika. A small monument in her honour was built near the military research facility in Moscow that prepared Laika's flight to space. It portrayed a dog standing on top of a rocket. She also appears on the <a href="Monument%20to%20the%20Conquerors%20of%20Space">Monument to the Conquerors of Space</a> in Moscow.

After the success of <a href="Sputnik%201">Sputnik 1</a> in October 1957, <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, the Soviet <a href="leader">leader</a>, wanted a spacecraft launched on 7 November 1957, the 40th anniversary of the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a>. Construction had already started on a more sophisticated satellite, but it would not be ready until December; this satellite would later become <a href="Sputnik%203">Sputnik 3</a>.

Meeting the November deadline meant building a new craft. Khrushchev specifically wanted his engineers to deliver a "space spectacular", a mission that would repeat the triumph of Sputnik 1, stunning the world with Soviet prowess. Planners settled on an orbital flight with a dog. Soviet rocket engineers had long intended a canine orbit before attempting human spaceflight; since 1951, they had lofted 12 dogs into sub-orbital space on ballistic flights, working gradually toward an orbital mission set for some time in 1958. To satisfy Khrushchev's demands, they expedited the orbital canine flight for the November launch.

According to Russian sources, the official decision to launch Sputnik 2 was made on 10 or 12 October, leaving less than four weeks to design and build the spacecraft. Sputnik 2, therefore, was something of a rush job, with most elements of the spacecraft being constructed from rough sketches. Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation for measuring <a href="solar%20irradiance">solar irradiance</a> and <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s.

The craft was equipped with a life-support system consisting of an <a href="Chemical%20oxygen%20generator">oxygen generator</a> and devices to avoid <a href="oxygen%20toxicity">oxygen poisoning</a> and to absorb <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A <a href="Dog%20harness">harness</a> was designed to be fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An <a href="electrocardiogram">electrocardiogram</a> monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.

Laika was found as a <a href="Street%20dogs%20in%20Moscow">stray</a> wandering the streets of <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>. Soviet scientists chose to use Moscow strays since they assumed that such animals had already learned to endure conditions of extreme cold and hunger. This specimen was a <a href="mongrel">mongrel</a> female, approximately three years old. Another account reported that she weighed about . Soviet personnel gave her several names and nicknames, among them Kudryavka (Russian for "Little Curly"), Zhuchka ("Little Bug"), and Limonchik ("Little Lemon"). Laika, the Russian name for several <a href="List%20of%20dog%20breeds">breeds of dogs</a> similar to the <a href="husky">husky</a>, was the name popularised around the world. The American press dubbed her Muttnik ("<a href="mongrel">mutt</a>" + suffix "<a href="-nik">-nik</a>") as a <a href="pun">pun</a> on <a href="Sputnik%20program">Sputnik</a>, or referred to her as "Curly". Her true pedigree is unknown, although it is generally accepted that she was part husky or other Nordic breed, and possibly part <a href="terrier">terrier</a>. NASA refers to Laika as a "part-<a href="Samoyed%20%28dog%29">Samoyed</a> terrier." A Russian magazine described her temperament as <a href="phlegmatic">phlegmatic</a>, saying that she did not quarrel with other dogs. <a href="Vladimir%20Yazdovsky">Vladimir Yazdovsky</a>, who led the program of test dogs used on rockets, in a later publication wrote that “Laika was quiet and charming”.

The Soviet Union and United States had previously sent animals only on <a href="sub-orbital%20spaceflight">sub-orbital</a> flights. Three dogs were trained for the Sputnik 2 flight: <a href="Soviet%20space%20dogs%23Albina%20and%20Tsyganka">Albina</a>, <a href="Mushka">Mushka</a>, and Laika. Soviet space-life scientists Vladimir Yazdovsky and <a href="Oleg%20Gazenko">Oleg Gazenko</a> trained the dogs.

To adapt the dogs to the confines of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. <a href="Laxatives">Laxatives</a> did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in <a href="centrifuge">centrifuge</a>s that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a> to increase by 30–65 <a href="torr">torr</a>. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.

Before the launch, one of the mission scientists took Laika home to play with his children. In a book chronicling the story of Soviet space medicine, Dr. Vladimir Yazdovsky wrote, "Laika was quiet and charming...I wanted to do something nice for her: She had so little time left to live."

Vladimir Yazdovsky made the final selection of dogs and their designated roles. Laika was to be the "flight dog"—a sacrifice to science on a one-way mission to space. Albina, who had already flown twice on a high-altitude test <a href="rocket">rocket</a>, was to act as Laika's backup. The third dog Mushka was a "<a href="Scientific%20control">control dog</a>"—she was to stay on the ground and be used to test instrumentation and <a href="life%20support">life support</a>.

Before leaving for the <a href="Baikonur%20Cosmodrome">Baikonur Cosmodrome</a>, Yazdovsky and Gazenko conducted surgery on the dogs, routing the cables from the transmitters to the sensors that would measure breathing, pulse, and blood pressure.

Because the existing airstrip at <a href="Turatam">Turatam</a> near the cosmodrome was small, the dogs and crew had to be first flown aboard a <a href="Tu-104">Tu-104</a> plane to <a href="Tashkent">Tashkent</a>. From there, a smaller and lighter <a href="Ilyushin%20Il-14">Il-14</a> plane took them to Turatam. Training of dogs continued upon arrival; one after another they were placed in the capsules to get familiar with the feeding system.

According to a <a href="NASA">NASA</a> document, Laika was placed in the capsule of the satellite on 31 October 1957—three days before the start of the mission. At that time of year, the temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold, and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika's fur was sponged in a weak <a href="ethanol">alcohol</a> solution and carefully groomed, while <a href="iodine">iodine</a> was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.

One of the technicians preparing the capsule before final liftoff stated that "after placing Laika in the container and before closing the hatch, we kissed her nose and wished her bon voyage, knowing that she would not survive the flight."

The exact time of the liftoff varies from source to source and is mentioned as 05:30:42 Moscow Time or 07:22 Moscow Time.

At peak acceleration Laika's respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate. The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After reaching orbit, Sputnik 2's <a href="nose%20cone">nose cone</a> was jettisoned successfully; however the "Block A" core did not separate as planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the <a href="thermal%20insulation">thermal insulation</a> tore loose, raising the cabin temperature to . After three hours of <a href="weightlessness">weightlessness</a>, Laika's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min, three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests, an indication of the stress she was under. The early <a href="telemetry">telemetry</a> indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food. After approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft.

The Soviet scientists had planned to euthanise Laika with a poisoned serving of food. For many years, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> gave conflicting statements that she had died either from <a href="asphyxia">asphyxia</a>, when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth orbit. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating. According to a paper he presented to the <a href="World%20Space%20Congress">World Space Congress</a> in <a href="Houston">Houston, Texas</a>, "It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints."

Over five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik 2—including Laika's remains—disintegrated during re-entry on 14 April 1958.

Due to the overshadowing issue of the Soviet vs. U.S. <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a>, the ethical issues raised by this experiment went largely unaddressed for some time. As newspaper clippings from 1957 show, the press was initially focused on reporting the political perspective, while the health and retrieval—or lack thereof—of Laika only became an issue later.

Sputnik 2 was not designed to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die. The mission sparked a debate across the globe on the <a href="Cruelty%20to%20animals">mistreatment of animals</a> and <a href="animal%20testing">animal testing</a> in general to advance science. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="Dogs%20Trust">National Canine Defence League</a> called on all dog owners to observe a minute's silence, while the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Animals">Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</a> (RSPCA) received protests even before Radio Moscow had finished announcing the launch. <a href="Animal%20rights">Animal rights</a> groups at the time called on members of the public to protest at Soviet embassies. Others demonstrated outside the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> in New York. These protests were largely stirred up and instrumentalized as an ideological struggle by various interest groups. Laboratory researchers in the <a href="United%20States">U.S</a>. offered some support for the Soviets, at least before the news of Laika's death.

In the Soviet Union, there was less controversy. Neither the media, books in the following years, nor the public openly questioned the decision to send a dog into space. In 1998, after the collapse of the Soviet regime, <a href="Oleg%20Gazenko">Oleg Gazenko</a>, one of the scientists responsible for sending Laika into space, expressed regret for allowing her to die:
In other <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> countries, open criticism of the Soviet space program was difficult because of political censorship, but there were notable cases of criticism in Polish scientific circles. A Polish scientific periodical, ""Kto, Kiedy, Dlaczego"" ("Who, When, Why"), published in 1958, discussed the mission of Sputnik 2. In the periodical's section dedicated to astronautics, <a href="Krzysztof%20Boru%C5%84">Krzysztof Boruń</a> described the Sputnik 2 mission as "regrettable" and criticised not bringing Laika back to Earth alive as "undoubtedly a great loss for science".

Laika is memorialised in the form of a statue and plaque at <a href="Star%20City%2C%20Russia">Star City, Russia</a>, the Russian Cosmonaut training facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with her ears erect. The <a href="Monument%20to%20the%20Conquerors%20of%20Space">Monument to the Conquerors of Space</a>, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008 at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.

Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: <a href="Soviet%20space%20dogs%23Bars%20and%20Lisichka">Bars and Lisichka</a> were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; <a href="Soviet%20space%20dogs%23Pchyolka%20and%20Mushka">Pchyolka and Mushka</a> died when <a href="Korabl-Sputnik%203">Korabl-Sputnik 3</a> was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.

Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film "<a href="My%20Life%20as%20a%20Dog">My Life as a Dog</a>", in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog. <a href="Laika%20%28comics%29">"Laika"</a>, a 2007 graphic novel by <a href="Nick%20Abadzis">Nick Abadzis</a> giving a fictionalized account of Laika's life, won the <a href="Eisner%20Award">Eisner Award</a> for Best Publication for Teens.

Master of Puppets

Master of Puppets is the third studio album by American <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> band <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>. It was released on March 3, 1986 by <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a>. Recorded at the <a href="Sweet%20Silence%20Studios">Sweet Silence Studios</a> with producer <a href="Flemming%20Rasmussen">Flemming Rasmussen</a>, it was the first Metallica album released on a major record label. "Master of Puppets" was the band's last album to feature bassist <a href="Cliff%20Burton">Cliff Burton</a>, who died in a bus accident in Sweden during the album's promotional tour. The album peaked at number 29 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> and became the first <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> album to be certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">platinum</a>. It was certified 6× platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) in 2003 for shipping six million copies in the United States. The album was eventually certified 6× platinum by <a href="Music%20Canada">Music Canada</a> and gold by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> (BPI).

Released to critical acclaim, the album is considered to be one of the best in history, and one of the most influential to heavy metal. Its driving, virtuosic music and angry political lyrics drew praise from critics outside the metal community. With its atmospheric and meticulously performed songs, critics credit it for consolidating the American thrash metal scene. Many bands from all genres of heavy metal have covered the album's songs, including tribute albums. "Master of Puppets" was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" enough for preservation in the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a> by the United States <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> in 2015, the first metal recording to do so.

The cover was designed by Metallica and <a href="Peter%20Mensch">Peter Mensch</a> and painted by Don Brautigam. It depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated by a pair of hands in a blood-red sky. Instead of releasing a single or video in advance of the album's release, Metallica embarked on a five-month American tour in support of <a href="Ozzy%20Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a>. The European leg was canceled after Burton's death in September 1986, and the band returned home to audition a new bassist. Metallica honored the album's 20th anniversary on the <a href="Escape%20from%20the%20Studio%20%2706">Escape from the Studio '06</a> tour, by playing it in its entirety. A remastered version was released in November 2017.

Metallica's 1983 debut "<a href="Kill%20%27Em%20All">Kill 'Em All</a>" laid the foundation for <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> with its aggressive musicianship and vitriolic lyrics. The album revitalized the American <a href="underground%20scene">underground scene</a>, and inspired similar records by contemporaries. The band's second album "<a href="Ride%20the%20Lightning">Ride the Lightning</a>" extended the limits of the genre with its more sophisticated songwriting and improved production. The album caught the attention of <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> representative Michael Alago, who signed the group to an eight-album deal in the fall of 1984, halfway through the album's promotional tour. Elektra reissued "Ride the Lightning" on November 19, and the band began touring larger venues and festivals throughout 1985. After parting with manager <a href="Jon%20Zazula">Jon Zazula</a>, Metallica hired Q Prime executives Cliff Burnstein and <a href="Peter%20Mensch">Peter Mensch</a>. During the summer, the band played the <a href="Monsters%20of%20Rock">Monsters of Rock</a> festival at <a href="Castle%20Donington">Castle Donington</a>, alongside <a href="Bon%20Jovi">Bon Jovi</a> and <a href="Ratt%20%28band%29">Ratt</a> to an audience of 70,000. 

Metallica was motivated to make an album that would impress critics and fans, and began writing new material in mid-1985. Lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist <a href="James%20Hetfield">James Hetfield</a> and drummer <a href="Lars%20Ulrich">Lars Ulrich</a> were the main songwriters on the album, already titled "Master of Puppets". The two developed ideas at a garage in <a href="El%20Cerrito%2C%20California">El Cerrito, California</a>, before inviting bassist <a href="Cliff%20Burton">Cliff Burton</a> and guitarist <a href="Kirk%20Hammett">Kirk Hammett</a> for rehearsals. Hetfield and Ulrich described the songwriting process as starting with "guitar riffs, assembled and reassembled until they start to sound like a song". After that, the band came up with a song title and topic, and Hetfield wrote lyrics to match the title. "Master of Puppets" is Metallica's first album not to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist <a href="Dave%20Mustaine">Dave Mustaine</a>. Mustaine claimed he had co-written "Leper Messiah", based on an old song called "The Hills Ran Red". The band denied this, but stated that one section incorporated Mustaine's ideas.

The band was not satisfied with the acoustics of the American studios they considered, and decided to record in Ulrich's native Denmark. Ulrich took drum lessons, and Hammett worked with <a href="Joe%20Satriani">Joe Satriani</a> to learn how to record more efficiently. Ulrich was in talks with <a href="Rush%20%28band%29">Rush</a>'s bassist and vocalist <a href="Geddy%20Lee">Geddy Lee</a> to produce the album, but the collaboration never materialized because of uncoordinated schedules. Metallica recorded the album with producer <a href="Flemming%20Rasmussen">Flemming Rasmussen</a> at <a href="Sweet%20Silence%20Studios">Sweet Silence Studios</a> in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, from September 1 to December 27, 1985. The writing of all the songs except "Orion" and "The Thing That Should Not Be" was completed before the band's arrival in Copenhagen. Rasmussen stated that the band brought well-prepared <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demos</a> of the songs, and only slight changes were made to the compositions in the studio. The recording took longer than the previous album because Metallica had developed a sense of perfectionism and had higher ambitions. Metallica eschewed the slick production and synthesizers of contemporary hard rock and heavy metal albums by Bon Jovi, <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>, and <a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest</a>. With a reputation for drinking, the band stayed sober on recording days. Hammett recalled that the group was "just making another album" at the time and "had no idea that the record would have such a range of influence that it went on to have". He also said that the group was "definitely peaking" at the time and that the album had "the sound of a band really gelling, really learning how to work well together".

Rasmussen and Metallica did not manage to complete the mixtapes as planned. Instead, the multitrack recordings were sent in January 1986 to <a href="Michael%20Wagener">Michael Wagener</a>, who finished the album's mixing. The cover was designed by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam. It depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated by a pair of hands in a blood-red sky. Ulrich explained that the artwork summarized the lyrical content of the album—people being subconsciously manipulated. The original artwork was sold at <a href="Rockefeller%20Plaza">Rockefeller Plaza</a>, New York City for $28,000 in 2008. The band mocked the warning stickers promoted by the <a href="Parents%20Music%20Resource%20Center">PMRC</a> with a facetious <a href="Parental%20Advisory">Parental Advisory</a> label on the cover: "The only track you probably won't want to play is 'Damage, Inc.' due to the multiple use of the infamous 'F' word. Otherwise, there aren't any '<a href="Seven%20dirty%20words">shits', 'fucks', 'pisses', 'cunts', 'motherfuckers', or 'cocksuckers'</a> anywhere on this record".

The album was recorded with the following equipment: Hammett's guitars were a 1974 <a href="Gibson%20Flying%20V">Gibson Flying V</a>, a <a href="Jackson%20Randy%20Rhoads">Jackson Randy Rhoads</a>, and a <a href="Fernandes%20Guitars">Fernandes</a> Stratocaster copy; Hetfield used a <a href="Jackson%20King%20V">Jackson King V</a> played through a <a href="Mesa%20Boogie%20Mark%20Series">Mesa Boogie Mark IIC+</a> amplifier modified as a pre-amp; Burton played an <a href="Aria%20%28guitar%20company%29">Aria Pro II SB1000</a> through Mesa Boogie amplifier heads and cabinets; Ulrich played <a href="Tama%20Drums">Tama</a> drum equipment, and borrowed a rare S.L.P. Black Brass from <a href="Def%20Leppard">Def Leppard</a> drummer <a href="Rick%20Allen%20%28drummer%29">Rick Allen</a>.

"Master of Puppets" features dynamic music and thick arrangements. Metallica delivered a more refined approach and performance compared to the previous two albums, with multilayered songs and technical dexterity. This album and its predecessor "Ride the Lightning" follow a similar track sequencing: both open with an <a href="up-tempo">up-tempo</a> song with an acoustic intro, followed by a lengthy title track, and a fourth track with ballad qualities. Although both albums are similarly structured, the musicianship on "Master of Puppets" is more powerful and epic in scope, with tight rhythms and delicate guitar solos. According to music writer <a href="Joel%20McIver">Joel McIver</a>, "Master of Puppets" introduced a new level of heaviness and complexity in thrash metal, displaying atmospheric and precisely executed songs. Hetfield's vocals had matured from the hoarse shouting of the first two albums to a deeper, in-control yet aggressive style. The songs explore themes such as control and the abuse of power. The lyrics describe the consequences of alienation, oppression, and feelings of powerlessness. Author Ryan Moore thought the lyrics depicted "ominous yet unnamed forces of power wielding total control over helpless human subjects". The lyrics were considered perceptive and harrowing, and were praised for being honest and socially conscious by writer Brock Helander. Referring to the epic proportions of the songs, <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a>'s Eamonn Stack stated that "at this stage in their careers Metallica weren't even doing songs, they were telling stories". The compositions and arrangements benefited from Burton's classical training and understanding of harmony.

"Battery" refers to angry violence, as in the term "assault and battery". Some critics contended that the title actually refers to an artillery battery, and interpreted it as "Hetfield of a war tactic as the aggressor" personifying destruction. The song begins with bass-heavy acoustic guitars that build upon multitracked layers until they are joined by a sonic wall of distorted electric guitars. It then breaks into fast, aggressive riffing featuring off-beat rhythms and heavily distorted minor <a href="Dyad%20%28music%29">dyads</a> where root-fifth <a href="power%20chord">power chord</a>s might be expected. Hetfield improvised the riff while relaxing in London. "<a href="Master%20of%20Puppets%20%28song%29">Master of Puppets</a>" consists of several riffs with odd meters and a cleanly picked middle section with melodic solo. The song shares a similar structure with "The Four Horsemen" from the band's first album: two verse-chorus sets lead to a lengthy interlude to another verse-chorus set. The opening and pre-verse sections feature fast downstroked <a href="chromatic%20scale">chromatic</a> riffing at 220 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>. The persistent and precise eighth-note riffing of the verse is made more intense by switching to an off-kilter <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a> on each fourth <a href="bar%20%28music%29">bar</a>. A lengthy interlude follows the second chorus, beginning with a clean, arpeggiated section over which Hetfield contributes a melodic solo; the riffing becomes distorted and progressively more heavy and Hammett provides a more virtuosic solo before the song returns to the main verse. The song closes with a fade-out of sinister laughter. The theme is <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> addiction, a topic considered taboo at the time.

"The Thing That Should Not Be" was inspired by the <a href="Cthulhu%20Mythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a> created by famed horror writer <a href="H.P.%20Lovecraft">H.P. Lovecraft</a>, with notable direct references to "<a href="The%20Shadow%20Over%20Innsmouth">The Shadow Over Innsmouth</a>" and to <a href="Cthulhu">Cthulhu</a> himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus. It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)" was based on <a href="Ken%20Kesey">Ken Kesey</a>'s novel "<a href="One%20Flew%20Over%20the%20Cuckoo%27s%20Nest%20%28novel%29">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a>" and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and <a href="Guitar%20harmonic">harmonics</a>. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating and time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of <a href="power%20ballad">power ballad</a>s Metallica set with "<a href="Fade%20to%20Black%20%28song%29">Fade to Black</a>" on "Ride the Lightning" and would revisit with "<a href="One%20%28Metallica%20song%29">One</a>" on "<a href="...And%20Justice%20for%20All%20%28album%29">...And Justice for All</a>".

"Disposable Heroes" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record. The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films. The syncopated riffing of "Leper Messiah" challenges the hypocrisy of the <a href="televangelism">televangelism</a> that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of "Lie!". The title derives from the lyrics to the <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a> song "<a href="Ziggy%20Stardust%20%28song%29">Ziggy Stardust</a>". "Orion" is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with a fade-in bass section, heavily processed to resemble an orchestra. It continues with mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass solo at half-tempo. The tempo accelerates during the latter part, and ends with music fading out. Burton arranged the middle section, which features its moody bass line and multipart guitar harmonies. "Damage, Inc." rants about senseless violence and reprisal at an unspecified target. It starts with a series of reversed bass chords based on the chorale prelude of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>'s "<a href="Komm%2C%20s%C3%BC%C3%9Fer%20Tod%2C%20komm%20selge%20Ruh">Come, Sweet Death</a>". The song then jumps into a rapid rhythm with a pedal-point riff in E that Hammett says was influenced by <a href="Deep%20Purple">Deep Purple</a>.

"Master of Puppets" was hailed as a masterpiece by critics outside of the heavy metal audience and cited by some as the genre's greatest album. In a contemporary review, Tim Holmes of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" asserted that the band had redefined heavy metal with the technical skill and subtlety showcased on the album, which he described as "the sound of global paranoia". "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" wrote that "Master of Puppets" "finally put Metallica into the big leagues where they belong". Editor Tom King said Metallica was at an "incredible song-writing peak" during the recording sessions, partially because Burton contributed to the songwriting. By contrast, "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" magazine's Judge I-Rankin was disappointed with the album and said, although the production is exceptional and Metallica's experimentation is commendable, it eschews the less "intellectual" approach of "Kill 'Em All" for a <a href="MDC%20%28band%29">MDC</a>-inspired direction that is inconsistent.

In a retrospective review, <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Steve Huey viewed "Master of Puppets" as Metallica's best album and remarked that, although it was not as unexpected as "Ride the Lightning", it is a more musically and thematically consistent album. <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" said the songs were the band's most intense at that point, and veer toward "the progressive tendency of <a href="Rush%20%28band%29">Rush</a>." Adrien Begrand of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> praised the production as "a metal version of <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a>'s <a href="Wall%20of%20Sound">Wall of Sound</a>" and believed none of Metallica's subsequent albums could match its passionate and intense musical quality. BBC Music's Eamonn Stack called the album "hard, fast, rock with substance" and likened the songs to stories of "biblical proportions". Canadian journalist <a href="Martin%20Popoff">Martin Popoff</a> compared the album to "Ride the Lightning" and found "Master of Puppets" not a remake, though similar in "awesome power and effect". <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> was more critical. Writing in "" (1990), he said the band's energy and political motivations are respectable, but the music evokes clichéd images of "revolutionary heroes" who are "male chauvinists too inexperienced to know better".

Released on March 3, 1986, the album had a 72-week run on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> album charts and earned the band its first <a href="RIAA%20certification">gold certification</a>. The album debuted on March 29, 1986, at number 128 and peaked at number 29 on the "Billboard" 200 chart. "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" reported that 300,000 copies were sold in its first three weeks. More than 500,000 copies were sold in its first year, even with virtually no radio airplay and no music videos. In 2003, "Master of Puppets" was certified 6× platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA), with six million copies shipped in the United States. Between the beginning of the <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a> era in 1991 and 2009, 4,578,000 copies were sold. The album was less successful on an international level, entering the top 40 on the <a href="Media%20Control%20Charts">German</a> and <a href="Swiss%20Hitparade">Swiss</a> album charts in its inaugural year. In 2004, it peaked within the top 10 in <a href="The%20Official%20Finnish%20Charts">Finland</a> and into the top 15 in <a href="Sverigetopplistan">Sweden</a>. In 2008, the album reached the top 40 on the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">Australian</a> and <a href="VG-lista">Norwegian</a> album charts. It received 6× platinum certification from <a href="Music%20Canada">Music Canada</a> and a golden award from the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> (BPI) for shipments of 600,000 and 100,000 copies, respectively.

"Master of Puppets" has appeared in several publications' best album lists. It was ranked number 167 on the list of <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>; the magazine would later rank it second on its 2017 list of "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time", behind <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>'s "<a href="Paranoid%20%28album%29">Paranoid</a>". "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" included the album in its list of the 100 best albums of all time. According to the magazine's <a href="Josh%20Tyrangiel">Josh Tyrangiel</a>, "Master of Puppets" reinforced the velocity of playing in heavy metal and diminished some of its clichés. "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" placed the album at number 90 on its list of the best albums of the 1980s, saying "Master of Puppets" is Metallica's best and most sincere recording. The album is featured in Robert Dimery's book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>". <a href="IGN">IGN</a> named "Master of Puppets" the best heavy metal album of all time. The website stated it was Metallica's best because it "built upon and perfected everything they had experimented with prior" and that "all the pieces come together in glorious cohesion". Music journalist <a href="Martin%20Popoff">Martin Popoff</a> also ranked it the best heavy metal album. The album was voted the fourth greatest guitar album of all time by "<a href="Guitar%20World">Guitar World</a>" in 2006, and the title track ranked number 61 on the magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitar solos. "<a href="Total%20Guitar">Total Guitar</a>" ranked the main riff of the title track at number 7 among the top 20 guitar riffs. The April 2006 edition of "Kerrang!" was dedicated to the album and gave away to readers the cover album "Master of Puppets: Remastered".

"Master of Puppets " became thrash metal's first platinum album and by the early 1990s thrash metal successfully challenged and redefined the mainstream of heavy metal. Metallica and a few other bands headlined arena concerts and appeared regularly on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>, although radio play remained incommensurate with their popularity. "Master of Puppets" is widely accepted as the genre's most accomplished album, and paved the way for subsequent development. The album, in the words of writer <a href="Christopher%20Knowles%20%28comics%29">Christopher Knowles</a>, "ripped Metallica away from the underground and put them atop the metal mountain". David Hayter from "Guitar Planet" recognized the album as one of the most influential records ever made and a benchmark by which other metal albums should be judged. MTV's Kyle Anderson had similar thoughts, saying that 25 years after its release the album remained a "stone cold classic". Carlos Ramirez from <a href="Noisecreep">Noisecreep</a> believes that "Master of Puppets" stands as one of the most representative albums of its genre.

1986 is seen as a pinnacle year for thrash metal in which the genre broke out of the underground due to albums such as <a href="Megadeth">Megadeth</a>'s "<a href="Peace%20Sells...%20but%20Who%27s%20Buying%3F">Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?</a>" and <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a>'s "<a href="Reign%20in%20Blood">Reign in Blood</a>". <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a> released "<a href="Among%20the%20Living">Among the Living</a>" in 1987, and by the end of the year these bands, alongside Metallica, were being called the "Big Four" of thrash metal. "Master of Puppets" frequently tops critic and fan polls of favorite thrash metal albums—the most frequent rival is Slayer's "Reign in Blood", also released in 1986 and also considered that band's peak. The rivalry partially stemmed from a contrast in approaches on the two albums, between the sophistication of "Master of Puppets" and the velocity of "Reign in Blood". Histories of the band tend to position "Ride the Lightning", "Master of Puppets", and "...And Justice for All" as a trilogy over the course of which the band's music progressively matured and became more sophisticated. In 2015, the album was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> and was selected for preservation in the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a>.

Metallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for <a href="Ozzy%20Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname "Alcoholica". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading "Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. "In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won them over. And fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica." Metallica won over Osbourne's fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following.

The tour, however, was notable for several incidents. Hetfield broke his wrist in a mid-tour skateboarding accident, and his guitar technician <a href="John%20Marshall%20%28guitarist%29">John Marshall</a> played rhythm guitar on several dates. The European leg of the <a href="Damage%2C%20Inc.%20Tour">Damage, Inc. Tour</a> commenced in September, with Anthrax as the supporting band. After the performance of September 26 in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, the band's bus rolled over on a stretch of icy road the following morning. Burton was thrown through a window and killed instantly. The driver was charged with manslaughter but was not convicted. The band returned to San Francisco and hired <a href="Flotsam%20and%20Jetsam%20%28band%29">Flotsam and Jetsam</a> bassist <a href="Jason%20Newsted">Jason Newsted</a> to replace Burton. Many of the songs that appeared on the band's next album, "...And Justice for All", were composed during Burton's career with the band.

All of the songs have been performed live and some became permanent setlist features. Four tracks were featured on the nine-song set list for the album's promotional tour: "Battery" as opener, "Master of Puppets", "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)", and "Damage, Inc." The title track, which was issued as a single in France, became a live staple and the most played Metallica song. "<a href="Loudwire">Loudwire</a>"s Chad Childers characterized the band's performance as "furious" and the song as the set's highlight. "Rolling Stone" described the live performance as "a classic in all its eight-minute glory". While filming its 3D movie "" (2013) at the <a href="Rogers%20Arena">Rogers Arena</a> in Vancouver, crosses were rising from the stage during the song, reminiscent of the album's cover art.

"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)" is the second-most performed song from the album. The live performance is often accompanied by lasers, pyrotechnical effects and film screens. "Battery" is usually played at the beginning of the setlist or during the encore, accompanied by lasers and flame plumes. "Disposable Heroes" is featured in the video album "" (2009) filmed in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>, in which the song was played on the second of three nights at the <a href="Foro%20Sol">Foro Sol</a>. "Orion" is the least-performed song from the album. Its first live performance was during the <a href="Escape%20from%20the%20Studio%20%2706">Escape from the Studio '06</a> tour, when the band performed the album in its entirety, honoring the 20th anniversary of its release. The band performed the album in the middle of the set. "Battery", "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)", "Damage, Inc." and the full-length "Master of Puppets" were revived for the band's concerts in 1998 and 1999, after having been retired for a number of years.

All lyrics written by <a href="James%20Hetfield">James Hetfield</a>. The bonus tracks on the digital re-release were recorded live at the <a href="Seattle%20Coliseum">Seattle Coliseum</a>, <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> on August 29 and 30, 1989, and also appeared on the live album "" (1993).

Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> band <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label <a href="Megaforce%20Records">Megaforce Records</a>. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer <a href="Flemming%20Rasmussen">Flemming Rasmussen</a> at the <a href="Sweet%20Silence%20Studios">Sweet Silence Studios</a> in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an <a href="electric%20chair">electric chair</a> being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Stand">The Stand</a>". Although rooted in the <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist <a href="Cliff%20Burton">Cliff Burton</a> introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut "<a href="Kill%20%27Em%20All">Kill 'Em All</a>", Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label <a href="Music%20for%20Nations">Music for Nations</a> because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist <a href="Dave%20Mustaine">Dave Mustaine</a>, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, <a href="Kirk%20Hammett">Kirk Hammett</a>.

"Ride the Lightning" received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European <a href="Ride_the_Lightning_Tour">tour</a> in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as <a href="Monsters%20of%20Rock">Monsters of Rock</a> and <a href="Day%20on%20the%20Green">Day on the Green</a> later that year. Two months after its release, <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. "Ride the Lightning" peaked at number 100 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">6× platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping six million copies in the United States. Many rock publications have ranked "Ride the Lightning" on their best album lists, saying it had a lasting impact on the genre.

<a href="Metallica">Metallica</a> released their debut album, "<a href="Kill%20%27Em%20All">Kill 'Em All</a>", on the independent label <a href="Megaforce%20Records">Megaforce Records</a> on July 25, 1983. The album helped to establish <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a>, a <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> subgenre defined by its brisk riffs and intense percussion. After finishing its promotional tour, Metallica began composing new material, and from September, began performing the songs that were to make up "Ride the Lightning" at concerts. Because the band had little money, its members often ate one meal a day and stayed at fans' homes while playing at clubs across the United States. An incident occurred when part of Metallica's gear was stolen in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, and <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a> lent Metallica some of its equipment to complete the remaining dates. When not gigging, the band stayed in a rented house in <a href="El%20Cerrito%2C%20California">El Cerrito, California</a>, called the Metallica Mansion. Frontman <a href="James%20Hetfield">James Hetfield</a> felt uneasy about performing double duty on vocals and rhythm guitar, so the band offered the job to <a href="Armored%20Saint">Armored Saint</a> singer <a href="John%20Bush%20%28musician%29">John Bush</a>, who turned down the offer because Armored Saint was doing well at the time. Hetfield gradually built confidence as lead vocalist and kept his original role. Metallica started recording on February 20, 1984 at <a href="Sweet%20Silence%20Studios">Sweet Silence Studios</a> in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, Denmark. The album was produced by <a href="Flemming%20Rasmussen">Flemming Rasmussen</a>, the founder of Sweet Silence Studios. Drummer <a href="Lars%20Ulrich">Lars Ulrich</a> chose Rasmussen, because he liked his work on <a href="Rainbow%20%28rock%20band%29">Rainbow</a>'s "<a href="Difficult%20to%20Cure">Difficult to Cure</a>" (1981), and was keen to record in Europe. Rasmussen, who had not heard of Metallica, agreed to work on the album, even though his studio employees questioned the band's talent. Rasmussen listened to Metallica's tapes before the members arrived and thought the band had great potential. Metallica rehearsed the album's material at <a href="Mercyful%20Fate">Mercyful Fate</a>'s practice room in Copenhagen.

Before entering the studio, Metallica collected ideas on "riff tape" recordings of various jam sessions. Hetfield and Ulrich went through the tapes and selected the strongest riffs to assemble into songs. Instruments were recorded separately, with Hetfield playing only rhythm guitar. Rasmussen, with the support of drum <a href="roadie">roadie</a> Flemming Larsen, taught the basics of <a href="timing%20%28music%29">timing</a> and beat duration to Ulrich, who had a tendency to increase speed and had little knowledge of rhythm theory. Drums were recorded in an empty warehouse at the back of the studio, which was not soundproof, and caused <a href="reverberation">reverberation</a>. Although four tracks were already arranged, the band members were not used to creating songs in the studio, as they had not done so for "Kill 'Em All". "<a href="For%20Whom%20the%20Bell%20Tolls%20%28Metallica%20song%29">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>", "Trapped Under Ice" and "Escape" were written from scratch in Copenhagen, and the band put finishing touches on "Fight Fire with Fire", "Ride the Lightning", "<a href="Creeping%20Death">Creeping Death</a>", and "The Call of Ktulu", which were already performed live. Lead guitarist <a href="Kirk%20Hammett">Kirk Hammett</a> took the album's name from a passage in <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Stand">The Stand</a>". The cover art, displaying an electric chair in the midst of lightning bolts, was conceived before recording began. Metallica initially had sound problems, because its gear was stolen three weeks before the band arrived in Copenhagen. The band members slept in the studio by day as they could not afford a hotel and recorded by night, because the studio was booked by other artists during the daytime. Because the group was looking for a major label deal, several <a href="artists%20and%20repertoire">A&R</a> representatives from different labels visited the studio. At first, it seemed that Metallica was going to sign with <a href="Bronze%20Records">Bronze Records</a>, but the deal fell through, because Bronze executive <a href="Gerry%20Bron">Gerry Bron</a> did not appreciate the work done at Sweet Silence Studios, and wanted the US edition to be remixed by engineer <a href="Eddie%20Kramer">Eddie Kramer</a>, and even considered re-recording the album in another studio. Metallica was put off by Bron's failure to share the band's artistic vision and decided to look for another label for the US release, in spite of the fact that Bronze had already advertised Metallica as one of their bands.

Metallica had to record quickly because of European shows scheduled 29 days after it entered the studio. Recording finished on March 14, and Megaforce released the album on July 27. Although the original album budget was $20,000, the final expense was above $30,000. Metallica's European label <a href="Music%20for%20Nations">Music for Nations</a> paid the studio costs because Megaforce owner <a href="Jon%20Zazula">Jon Zazula</a> could not afford them. Metallica was unhappy with the lack of promotion by Megaforce, and decided to part ways with Zazula. Major label <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> employee Michael Alago noticed Metallica at The Stone gig in San Francisco, and invited Elektra's chairman and the head of promotion to see the August show in New York. The performance at <a href="Roseland%20Ballroom">Roseland Ballroom</a>, with Anthrax and Metallica opening for <a href="Raven%20%28British%20band%29">Raven</a>, pleased the Elektra staff, and the band was offered a contract the following morning. On September 12, Metallica signed with Elektra, who re-released the album on November 19. Cliff Burnstein and <a href="Peter%20Mensch">Peter Mensch</a> of Q Prime were concurrently appointed as the band's new managers. "Ride the Lightning" was the last Metallica album to feature co-writing contributions from former lead guitarist <a href="Dave%20Mustaine">Dave Mustaine</a>, who received credit on the title track and the instrumental "The Call of Ktulu". The album also represented the first time Hammett was given writing credits.

Music writers opine that "Ride the Lightning" exhibited greater musical maturity, with sonically broader songs than "Kill 'Em All", which was noted for its one-dimensional sound. This was partially because of bassist <a href="Cliff%20Burton">Cliff Burton</a>'s knowledge of music theory. He showed Hetfield how to augment core notes with complementary counter-melodies and how basic guitar harmony worked, which reflected on the song compositions. Hetfield developed more socially aware lyrics, as well as ominous and semi-philosophical references. Ulrich explained that Metallica opted not to rely strictly on fast tempos as on the previous album, but to explore other musical approaches that sounded powerful and heavy. "Grinder" magazine's Kevin Fisher summarized the album as "ultimate thrash, destruction and total blur" that reminded him of the speed and power of "Kill 'Em All". Music journalist <a href="Martin%20Popoff">Martin Popoff</a> observed that "Ride the Lightning" offered "sophistication and brutality in equal measure" and was seen as something new at the time of its release. Discussing the album's lyrical content, philosopher <a href="William%20Irwin%20%28philosopher%29">William Irwin</a> wrote: "After "Kill 'Em All", the rebellion and aggression became much more focused as the enemy became more clearly defined. Metallica was deeply concerned about various domains in which the common man was wrongfully yet ingeniously deceived. More precisely, they were highly critical of those in power".

The major-key acoustic introduction to "Fight Fire with Fire" displayed Metallica's evolution towards a more harmonically complex style of songwriting. The fastest Metallica song in terms of picking speed, it is driven by nimbly <a href="tremolo%20picking">tremolo-picked</a> riffs in the verses and chorus. The extended solo at the end dissolves in a sound effect of a vast nuclear explosion. The main riff was taped during the <a href="Kill%20%27Em%20All%20Tour">Kill 'Em All Tour</a> and the acoustic intro was something Burton was playing on acoustic guitar at the time. The song discouraged the "<a href="eye%20for%20an%20eye">eye for an eye</a>" approach, and its lyrical themes focused on nuclear warfare and <a href="Armageddon">Armageddon</a>. "Ride the Lightning" was Metallica's first song to emphasize the misery of the criminal justice system. The lyrics were written from the perspective of someone who is anticipating execution by the electric chair. The song, one of the two album tracks that credited Mustaine, begins in a mid-tempo which gradually accelerates as the song progress. It features an instrumental middle section highlighted by Hammett's soloing. According to Hetfield, the song was not a criticism of capital punishment, but a tale of a man sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit, as in the opening lyrics: "Guilty as charged/But Damn it/It ain't right".

"For Whom the Bell Tolls" begins with a bell tolling, followed by a marching riff and high-register bass melody. The chromatic introduction, which Burton wrote before he joined Metallica, is often mistaken for an electric guitar but is actually Burton's bass guitar augmented with <a href="distortion%20%28music%29">distortion</a> and a <a href="wah-wah%20pedal">wah-wah pedal</a>. The lyrics were inspired by <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>'s 1940 <a href="For%20Whom%20the%20Bell%20Tolls">novel of the same name</a>, which explores the horror and dishonor of modern warfare. "For Whom the Bell Tolls" was released as a promotional single in two versions, an edit on side A and the album version on side B. "<a href="Fade%20to%20Black%20%28song%29">Fade to Black</a>" is a <a href="power%20ballad">power ballad</a> whose lyrics contemplate suicide. Hetfield wrote the words because he felt powerless after the band's equipment was stolen before the January 1984 show in Boston. Musically, the song begins with an acoustic guitar introduction overlaid with electric soloing. The song becomes progressively heavier and faster, ending with multi-layered guitar solos. The ballad's <a href="arpeggio">arpeggiated chords</a> and reserved singing was incongruous for thrash metal bands at the time and disappointed some of Metallica's fans. The song's structure foreshadows later Metallica ballads, "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)", "<a href="One%20%28Metallica%20song%29">One</a>" and "<a href="The%20Day%20That%20Never%20Comes">The Day That Never Comes</a>. "Fade to Black" was released as a promotional single in 1984, in <a href="phosphorescence">glow in the dark</a> green.

"Trapped Under Ice" is about a person who wakes from a cryonic state. Realizing there is nowhere to go, and no-one will come to the rescue, the person helplessly awaits impending doom. The song is built on a fast-picked galloping riff, reminiscent of the album's opener. It was inspired by a track Hammett's former band <a href="Exodus%20%28band%29">Exodus</a> had demoed called "Impaler", which was later released on that band's 2004 album "<a href="Tempo%20of%20the%20Damned">Tempo of the Damned</a>". "Escape" was originally titled "The Hammer" and was intended to be released as a single due to its lighter riffs and conventional song structure. The intro features a counterpoint bass melody and a chugging guitar riff that resolves into a standard <a href="Downpicking">down-stroked</a> riff. "Escape" is Hetfield's most hated Metallica song, due to it being the result of their record company forcing Metallica to write something more radio friendly. Authors <a href="Mick%20Wall">Mick Wall</a> and <a href="Malcolm%20Dome">Malcolm Dome</a> felt the song was influenced by the <a href="album-oriented%20rock">album-oriented rock</a> of 1970s bands such as <a href="Journey%20%28band%29">Journey</a> and <a href="Foreigner%20%28band%29">Foreigner</a>, but fans perceived it as an attempt for airplay at rock radio. Metallica performed "Escape" live only once, at the 2012 <a href="Orion%20Music%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%2B%20More">Orion Music + More</a> festival, while performing "Ride the Lightning" in its entirety.

"Creeping Death" describes the (<a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Exodus</a> 12:29). The lyrics deal with the ten plagues visited on <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>; four of them are mentioned throughout the song, as well as the <a href="Passover">Passover</a>. The title was inspired by a scene from "<a href="The%20Ten%20Commandments%20%281956%20film%29">The Ten Commandments</a>" while the band was watching the movie at Burton's house. The bridge, with its chant "Die, by my hand!", was originally written by Hammett for the song "Die by His Hand" while he was playing in Exodus, who recorded it as a demo but did not feature it on a studio album. Journalist <a href="Joel%20McIver">Joel McIver</a> called the song a "<a href="moshpit">moshpit</a> anthem" due to its epic lyrical themes and dramatic atmosphere. "Creeping Death" was released as a single with a B-side titled "Garage Days Revisited" made up of covers of <a href="Diamond%20Head%20%28band%29">Diamond Head</a>'s "<a href="Am%20I%20Evil%3F">Am I Evil?</a>" and <a href="Blitzkrieg%20%28band%29">Blitzkrieg</a>'s "Blitzkrieg". "The Call of Ktulu", tentatively titled "When Hell Freezes Over", was inspired by <a href="H.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BP.%20Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s book "<a href="The%20Shadow%20over%20Innsmouth">The Shadow over Innsmouth</a>", which was introduced to the rest of the band by Burton. The title was taken from one of Lovecraft's key stories featuring Cthulhu, "<a href="The%20Call%20of%20Cthulhu">The Call of Cthulhu</a>", although the original name was modified to "Ktulu" for easier pronunciation. The track begins with D minor chord progression in the intro, followed by a two-minute bass solo over a rhythmic riff pattern. Conductor <a href="Michael%20Kamen">Michael Kamen</a> rearranged the piece for Metallica's 1999 "<a href="S%26amp%3BM%20%28Metallica%20album%29">S&M</a>" project and won a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rock%20Instrumental%20Performance">Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance</a> in 2001.

"Ride the Lightning" received widespread acclaim from music critics. According to <a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">"Q"</a> magazine, the album confirmed Metallica's status as the leading heavy metal band of the modern era. The magazine credited the group for redefining the norms of thrash metal with "Fade to Black", the genre's first power ballad. British rock magazine "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" stated that the album's maturity and musical intelligence helped Metallica expand heavy metal's boundaries. <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" described "Ride the Lightning" as a more refined extension of the group's debut. In a retrospective review, <a href="Sputnikmusic">Sputnikmusic</a>'s Channing Freeman named it as one of the few albums that can be charming and powerful at the same time. He praised Hetfield's vocal performance and concluded that Metallica was "firing on all cylinders". <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Steve Huey saw the album as a more ambitious and remarkable effort than "Kill 'Em All". He called "Ride the Lightning" an "all-time metal classic" because of the band's rich musical imagination and lyrics that avoided heavy metal cliches. "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Album%20Guide">The Rolling Stone Album Guide</a>" viewed the album as a great step forward for the band and as an album that established the concept for Metallica's following two records. <a href="Colin%20Larkin%20%28writer%29">Colin Larkin</a>, writing in the "<a href="Encyclopedia%20of%20Popular%20Music">Encyclopedia of Popular Music</a>", singled out "For Whom the Bell Tolls" as an example of Metallica's growing music potential. Popoff regards "Ride the Lightning" as an album where "<a href="extreme%20metal">extreme metal</a> became art". "This literally was the first album since (<a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest's</a> 1976) "<a href="Sad%20Wings%20of%20Destiny">Sad Wings of Destiny</a>" where the rulebook has changed. This was a new kind of heaviness; the soft, billowy but explosive production was amazing, the speed was superhuman", stated Popoff. Reviewing the 2016 reissue, Jason Anderson of "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" considers "Ride the Lightning" the second best Metallica album which set the pace for metal in the years to come.

Megaforce initially pressed 75,000 copies of the album for the US market, while Music for Nations took care of the European market. By the autumn of 1984, "Ride the Lightning" had moved 85,000 copies in Europe, resulting in Metallica's first cover story for "Kerrang!" in its December issue. After signing Metallica, Elektra released the single "Creeping Death" in a sleeve depicting a bridge and a skull painted grey and green. The album peaked at number 100 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> with no radio exposure. In 1984, the French record label Bernett Records misprinted the color of the album cover in green, rather than blue, and 400 copies with the green cover were produced. Because of their rarity, these green albums have become collectors' items. "Ride the Lightning" went gold by November 1987 and in 2012 was certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">6× platinum</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) for shipping six million copies in the US. The album, along with "Kill 'Em All", was reissued in 2016 as a boxed set including demos and live recordings. Many rock publications have ranked "Ride the Lightning" on their best album lists. The album placed fifth on <a href="IGN%20Music">IGN Music</a>'s "Top 25 Metal Albums" list. "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" listed it as a thrash metal essential, declaring it "the thrashiest thrash ever". According to "<a href="Guitar%20World">Guitar World</a>", "Ride the Lightning" "didn't just change the band's trajectory—it reset the course of metal itself". Corey Deiterman of the "<a href="Houston%20Press">Houston Press</a>" considers "Ride the Lightning" the most influential Metallica album, saying it had a lasting impact on genres such as <a href="crossover%20thrash">crossover thrash</a> and <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a>. In 2017, it was ranked 11th on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" list of "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time".

After recording was completed, Music for Nations founder Martin Hooker wanted to arrange a triple bill UK tour in March / April 1984 with <a href="Exciter%20%28band%29">Exciter</a>, Metallica, and <a href="The%20Rods">The Rods</a>. The Hell on Earth Tour never materialized because of poor ticket sales. To promote "Ride the Lightning", Metallica commenced the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour on November 16, in <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>, France, with British <a href="new%20wave%20of%20British%20heavy%20metal">NWOBHM</a> band <a href="Tank%20%28band%29">Tank</a> as support. The tour continued with dates in Belgium, Italy, Germany, and the Nordic countries to an average crowd of 1,300. After a Christmas break, the group embarked on a 50-date North American tour, firstly as a co-headlining act with <a href="W.A.S.P.%20%28band%29">W.A.S.P.</a> and then as headliners with Armored Saint supporting. At a gig in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, Metallica covered "The Money Will Roll Right In" by <a href="Fang%20%28band%29">Fang</a>, with Armored Saint onstage. The American leg ended in May 1985, and the band spent the following two months working on the next studio album, "<a href="Master%20of%20Puppets">Master of Puppets</a>", whose recording sessions were scheduled to begin in September. Metallica performed at the <a href="Monsters%20of%20Rock">Monsters of Rock</a> festival held at <a href="Castle%20Donington">Castle Donington</a> in England on August 17 in front of 70,000 fans. The band was placed between <a href="Ratt%20%28band%29">Ratt</a> and <a href="Bon%20Jovi">Bon Jovi</a>, two <a href="glam%20metal">glam metal</a> groups whose sound and appearance were much unlike Metallica's. At the start of the set, Hetfield pronounced to the audience: "If you came here to see spandex, eye make-up, and the words 'oh baby' in every fuckin' song, this ain't the fuckin' band!" Two weeks later, Metallica appeared on the <a href="Day%20on%20the%20Green">Day on the Green</a> festival in <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland, California</a>, before 90,000 people. The last show Metallica played before recording began was the <a href="Loreley">Loreley</a> Metal Hammer festival in Germany, headlined by <a href="Venom%20%28band%29">Venom</a>. Metallica finished 1985 with a show at the <a href="Sacramento%20Memorial%20Auditorium">Sacramento Memorial Auditorium</a> on December 29 opening for <a href="Y%26amp%3BT">Y&T</a>, and a New Year's Eve concert at the <a href="Bill%20Graham%20Civic%20Auditorium">Civic Auditorium</a> in San Francisco on a bill with <a href="Metal%20Church">Metal Church</a>, <a href="Exodus%20%28American%20band%29">Exodus</a>, and <a href="Megadeth">Megadeth</a>, the first time Metallica and Megadeth shared a stage. At this gig, Metallica premiered "<a href="Master%20of%20Puppets%20%28song%29">Master of Puppets</a>" and "Disposable Heroes", songs from the then-upcoming third studio album.

All lyrics written by <a href="James%20Hetfield">James Hetfield</a> (<a href="Kirk%20Hammett">Kirk Hammett</a> also contributed to lyrics for "<a href="Creeping%20Death">Creeping Death</a>"). The bonus tracks on the digital re-release were recorded live at the <a href="Seattle%20Coliseum">Seattle Coliseum</a>, <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> on August 29 and 30, 1989, and later appeared on the live album "" (1993).

The name "Manitoba" is believed to be derived from the <a href="Cree%20language">Cree</a>, <a href="Anishinaabe%20language">Ojibwe</a> or <a href="Assiniboine%20language">Assiniboine</a> languages. The name derives from Cree "manitou-wapow" or Ojibwa "manidoobaa", both meaning "straits of <a href="Manitou">Manitou</a>, the Great Spirit", a place referring to what are now called The Narrows in the centre of <a href="Lake%20Manitoba">Lake Manitoba</a>. It may also be from the <a href="Assiniboine%20language">Assiniboine</a> for "Lake of the Prairie".

The lake was known to French explorers as "Lac des Prairies." Thomas Spence chose the name to refer to a new republic he proposed for the area south of the lake. <a href="M%C3%A9tis">Métis</a> leader <a href="Louis%20Riel">Louis Riel</a> also chose the name, and it was accepted in Ottawa under the <a href="Manitoba%20Act">Manitoba Act</a> of 1870.

Manitoba is bordered by the provinces of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> to the east and <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> to the west, the territories of <a href="Nunavut">Nunavut</a> to the north, and the <a href="US%20states">US states</a> of <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> and <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> to the south. The province possibly meets the <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a> at the <a href="Four%20corners%20%28Canada%29">four corners</a> <a href="quadripoint">quadripoint</a> to the extreme northwest, though surveys have not been completed and laws are unclear about the exact location of the Nunavut–NWT boundary. Manitoba adjoins <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a> to the northeast, and is the only prairie province to have a saltwater coastline. The <a href="Port%20of%20Churchill">Port of Churchill</a> is Canada's only Arctic deep-water port. <a href="Lake%20Winnipeg">Lake Winnipeg</a> is the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Hudson Bay is the world's second-largest bay by area. Manitoba is at the heart of the giant Hudson Bay watershed, once known as <a href="Rupert%27s%20Land">Rupert's Land</a>. It was a vital area of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a>, with many rivers and lakes that provided excellent opportunities for the lucrative <a href="North%20American%20fur%20trade">fur trade</a>.

The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and more than 110,000 lakes, covering approximately 15.6 percent or of its surface area. Manitoba's major lakes are <a href="Lake%20Manitoba">Lake Manitoba</a>, <a href="Lake%20Winnipegosis">Lake Winnipegosis</a>, and <a href="Lake%20Winnipeg">Lake Winnipeg</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20lakes%20by%20area">tenth-largest freshwater lake</a> in the world. Some traditional Native lands and <a href="Taiga">boreal forest</a> on Lake Winnipeg's east side are a proposed <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>.

Manitoba is at the centre of the <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a> drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into <a href="Lake%20Winnipeg">Lake Winnipeg</a> and then north down the <a href="Nelson%20River">Nelson River</a> into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20North">Red</a>, <a href="Assiniboine%20River">Assiniboine</a>, <a href="Nelson%20River">Nelson</a>, <a href="Winnipeg%20River">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="Hayes%20River">Hayes</a>, <a href="Whiteshell%20River">Whiteshell</a> and <a href="Churchill%20River%20%28Hudson%20Bay%29">Churchill rivers</a>. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of <a href="Lake%20Agassiz">Glacial Lake Agassiz</a>. This region, particularly the <a href="Red%20River%20Valley">Red River Valley</a>, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.

<a href="Baldy%20Mountain%20%28Manitoba%29">Baldy Mountain</a> is the province's highest point at above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level. <a href="Riding%20Mountain%20National%20Park">Riding Mountain</a>, the <a href="Pembina%20Escarpment">Pembina Hills</a>, <a href="Sandilands%20Provincial%20Forest">Sandilands Provincial Forest</a>, and the <a href="Canadian%20Shield">Canadian Shield</a> are also upland regions. Much of the province's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including <a href="Whiteshell%20Provincial%20Park">Whiteshell</a>, <a href="Atikaki%20Provincial%20Wilderness%20Park">Atikaki</a>, and <a href="Nopiming%20Provincial%20Park">Nopiming Provincial Park</a>s.

Extensive agriculture is found only in the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in the <a href="Kelsey%2C%20Manitoba">Carrot Valley Region</a> (near <a href="The%20Pas">The Pas</a>). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and <a href="oilseed">oilseed</a> (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.

Manitoba has an extreme <a href="continental%20climate">continental climate</a>. Temperatures and precipitation generally decrease from south to north and increase from east to west. Manitoba is far from the moderating influences of mountain ranges or large bodies of water. Because of the generally flat landscape, it is exposed to cold <a href="Polar%20high">Arctic high-pressure</a> air masses from the northwest during January and February. In the summer, air masses sometimes come out of the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern United States</a>, as warm humid air is drawn northward from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. Temperatures exceed numerous times each summer, and the combination of heat and humidity can bring the <a href="humidex">humidex</a> value to the mid-40s. <a href="Carman%2C%20Manitoba">Carman, Manitoba</a> recorded the second-highest humidex ever in Canada in 2007, with 53.0. According to <a href="Environment%20Canada">Environment Canada</a>, Manitoba ranked first for clearest skies year round, and ranked second for clearest skies in the summer and for the sunniest province in the winter and spring.
<a href="Southern%20Manitoba">Southern Manitoba</a> (including the city of Winnipeg), falls into the humid continental climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of <a href="Palliser%27s%20Triangle">Palliser's Triangle</a>. The area is drier and more prone to <a href="drought">drought</a>s than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.

Southern parts of the province just north of <a href="Tornado%20Alley">Tornado Alley</a>, experience <a href="tornado">tornado</a>es, with 16 confirmed touchdowns in 2016. In 2007, on 22 and 23 June, numerous tornadoes touched down, the largest an <a href="Elie%2C%20Manitoba%20tornado">F5 tornado</a> that devastated parts of <a href="Elie%2C%20Manitoba">Elie</a> (the strongest recorded tornado in Canada).

The province's northern sections (including the city of <a href="Thompson%2C%20Manitoba">Thompson</a>) fall in the <a href="subarctic%20climate">subarctic climate</a> zone (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "Dfc"). This region features long and extremely cold winters and brief, warm summers with little precipitation. Overnight temperatures as low as occur on several days each winter.

Manitoba natural communities may be grouped within five ecozones: <a href="Boreal%20Plains%20Ecozone%20%28CEC%29">boreal plains</a>, <a href="Prairies%20Ecozone">prairie</a>, <a href="Taiga%20Shield%20Ecozone%20%28CEC%29">taiga shield</a>, <a href="Boreal%20Shield%20Ecozone%20%28CEC%29">boreal shield</a> and <a href="Hudson%20Plains%20Ecozone%20%28CEC%29">Hudson plains</a>. Three of these—taiga shield, boreal shield and Hudson plain—contain part of the <a href="Boreal%20forest%20of%20Canada">Boreal forest of Canada</a> which covers the province's eastern, southeastern, and northern reaches.

Forests make up about , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (<a href="Pinus%20banksiana">Jack Pine</a>, <a href="Pinus%20resinosa">Red Pine</a>, <a href="Pinus%20strobus">Eastern White Pine</a>), spruces (<a href="Picea%20glauca">White Spruce</a>, <a href="Picea%20mariana">Black Spruce</a>), <a href="Abies%20balsamea">Balsam Fir</a>, <a href="Larix%20laricina">Tamarack (larch)</a>, poplars (<a href="Populus%20tremuloides">Trembling Aspen</a>, <a href="Populus%20balsamifera">Balsam Poplar</a>), birches (<a href="Betula%20papyrifera">White Birch</a>, <a href="Betula%20pumila">Swamp Birch</a>) and small pockets of <a href="Thuja%20occidentalis">Eastern White Cedar</a>.

Two sections of the province are not dominated by forest. The province's northeast corner bordering Hudson Bay is above the <a href="treeline">treeline</a> and is considered <a href="tundra">tundra</a>. The <a href="tallgrass%20prairie">tallgrass prairie</a> once dominated the south central and southeastern parts including the Red River Valley. <a href="Mixed%20grass%20prairie">Mixed grass prairie</a> is found in the southwestern region. Agriculture has replaced much of the natural prairie but prairie still can be found in parks and protected areas; some are notable for the presence of the endangered <a href="Platanthera%20praeclara">western prairie fringed orchid</a>.

Manitoba is especially noted for its northern <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> population; <a href="Churchill%2C%20Manitoba">Churchill</a> is commonly referred to as the "Polar Bear Capital". Other large animals, including <a href="moose">moose</a>, <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a>, <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bears</a>, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s, <a href="lynx">lynx</a>, and <a href="gray%20wolf">wolves</a>, are common throughout the province, especially in the provincial and national <a href="List%20of%20protected%20areas%20of%20Manitoba">parks</a>. There is a large population of <a href="garter%20snake">red sided garter snakes</a> near <a href="Narcisse%2C%20Manitoba">Narcisse</a>; the dens there are home to the world's largest concentration of snakes.

Manitoba's bird diversity is enhanced by its position on two major migration routes, with 392 confirmed identified species; 287 of these nesting within the province. These include the <a href="great%20grey%20owl">great grey owl</a>, the province's official bird, and the endangered <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>.

Manitoba's lakes host 18 species of game fish, particularly species of <a href="trout">trout</a>, <a href="Pike%20%28fish%29">pike</a>, and <a href="goldeye">goldeye</a>, as well as many smaller fish.

Modern-day Manitoba was inhabited by the <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> people shortly after the <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">last ice age</a> <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s retreated in the southwest about 10,000 years ago; the first exposed land was the <a href="Turtle%20Mountain%20%28plateau%29">Turtle Mountain</a> area. The <a href="Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a>, <a href="Cree">Cree</a>, <a href="Dene">Dene</a>, <a href="Sioux">Sioux</a>, <a href="Mandan">Mandan</a>, and <a href="Assiniboine%20people">Assiniboine</a> peoples founded settlements, and other tribes entered the area to trade. In Northern Manitoba, <a href="quartz">quartz</a> was mined to make <a href="arrowhead">arrowhead</a>s. The first farming in Manitoba was along the Red River, where <a href="Maize">corn</a> and other seed crops were planted before contact with Europeans.
In 1611, <a href="Henry%20Hudson">Henry Hudson</a> was one of the first Europeans to sail into what is now known as Hudson Bay, where he was abandoned by his crew. The first European to reach present-day central and southern Manitoba was Sir <a href="Thomas%20Button">Thomas Button</a>, who travelled upstream along the Nelson River to Lake Winnipeg in 1612 in an unsuccessful attempt to find and rescue Hudson. When the British ship "<a href="Nonsuch%20%281650%20ship%29">Nonsuch</a>" sailed into Hudson Bay in 1668–1669, she became the first trading vessel to reach the area; that voyage led to the formation of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a>, to which the British government gave absolute control of the entire Hudson Bay watershed. This watershed was named <a href="Rupert%27s%20Land">Rupert's Land</a>, after <a href="Prince%20Rupert%20of%20the%20Rhine">Prince Rupert</a>, who helped to subsidize the Hudson's Bay Company. <a href="York%20Factory%2C%20Manitoba">York Factory</a> was founded in 1684 after the original fort of the Hudson's Bay Company, Fort Nelson (built in 1682), was destroyed by rival French traders.

<a href="Pierre%20Gaultier%20de%20Varennes%2C%20sieur%20de%20La%20V%C3%A9rendrye">Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye</a>, visited the Red River Valley in the 1730s to help open the area for French exploration and trade. As French explorers entered the area, a <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>-based company, the <a href="North%20West%20Company">North West Company</a>, began trading with the local Indigenous people. Both the North West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company built fur-trading forts; the two companies competed in southern Manitoba, occasionally resulting in violence, until they merged in 1821 (the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company%20Archives">Hudson's Bay Company Archives</a> in Winnipeg preserve the history of this era).

<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> secured the territory in 1763 after their victory over France in the North American theatre of the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, better known as the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> in North America; lasting from 1754 to 1763. The founding of the first agricultural community and settlements in 1812 by <a href="Thomas%20Douglas%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Selkirk">Lord Selkirk</a>, north of the area which is now downtown Winnipeg, led to conflict between British colonists and the Métis. Twenty colonists, including the governor, and one Métis were killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Seven%20Oaks%20%281816%29">Battle of Seven Oaks</a> in 1816. Thomas Spence attempted to be President of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Manitobah">Republic of Manitobah</a> in 1867, that he and his council named.

Rupert's Land was ceded to Canada by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869 and incorporated into the Northwest Territories; a lack of attention to Métis concerns caused Métis leader <a href="Louis%20Riel">Louis Riel</a> to establish a local provisional government which formed into the Convention of Forty and the subsequent elected Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia on March 9, 1870. This assembly subsequently sent three delegates to Ottawa to negotiate with the Canadian government. This resulted in the "<a href="Manitoba%20Act">Manitoba Act</a>" and that province's entry into the <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Canadian Confederation</a>. Prime Minister John A. Macdonald introduced the <a href="Manitoba%20Act">Manitoba Act</a> in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons of Canada</a>, the bill was given <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> and Manitoba was brought into Canada as a province in 1870. Louis Riel was pursued by British army officer <a href="Garnet%20Wolseley%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Wolseley">Garnet Wolseley</a> because of the rebellion, and Riel fled into exile. The Canadian government blocked the Métis' attempts to obtain land promised to them as part of Manitoba's entry into confederation. Facing racism from the new flood of white settlers from Ontario, large numbers of Métis moved to what would become Saskatchewan and <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>.

<a href="Numbered%20Treaties">Numbered Treaties</a> were signed in the late 19th century with the chiefs of various First Nations that lived in the area. These treaties made specific promises of land for every family. As a result, a <a href="Indian%20reserve">reserve system</a> was established under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. The prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given; this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through <a href="aboriginal%20land%20claim">aboriginal land claim</a>s, many of which are still ongoing.

The original province of Manitoba was a square one-eighteenth of its current size, and was known colloquially as the "postage stamp province". Its borders were expanded in 1881, taking land from the <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a> and the <a href="District%20of%20Keewatin">District of Keewatin</a>, but Ontario claimed a large portion of the land; the disputed portion was awarded to Ontario in 1889. Manitoba grew to its current size in 1912, absorbing land from the Northwest Territories to reach 60°N, uniform with the northern reach of its western neighbours <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>.

The <a href="Manitoba%20Schools%20Question">Manitoba Schools Question</a> showed the deep divergence of cultural values in the territory. The Catholic Franco-Manitobans had been guaranteed a state-supported <a href="separate%20school">separate school</a> system in the original constitution of Manitoba, but a grassroots political movement among English <a href="Protestantism">Protestants</a> from 1888 to 1890 demanded the end of French schools. In 1890, the Manitoba legislature passed a law removing funding for French Catholic schools. The French Catholic minority asked the federal government for support; however, the <a href="Orange%20Order%20in%20Canada">Orange Order</a> and other anti-Catholic forces mobilized nationwide to oppose them.

The federal <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada%20%28historical%29">Conservatives</a> proposed remedial legislation to override Manitoba, but they were blocked by the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberals</a>, led by <a href="Wilfrid%20Laurier">Wilfrid Laurier</a>, who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights. Once elected Prime Minister in 1896, Laurier implemented a compromise stating Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes at the end of the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.

By 1911, <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a> was the third largest city in Canada, and remained so until overtaken by <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> in the 1920s. A boomtown, it grew quickly around the start of the 20th century, with outside investors and immigrants contributing to its success. The drop in growth in the second half of the decade was a result of the opening of the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> in 1914, which reduced reliance on <a href="Transcontinental%20railroad">transcontinental railways</a> for trade, as well as a decrease in immigration due to the outbreak of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. Over 18,000 Manitoba residents enlisted in the first year of the war; by the end of the war, 14 Manitobans had received the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>.

After the First World War ended, severe discontent among farmers (over wheat prices) and union members (over wage rates) resulted in an upsurge of <a href="Political%20radicalism">radicalism</a>, coupled with a polarization over the rise of <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevism</a> in <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Russia</a>. The most dramatic result was the <a href="Winnipeg%20general%20strike">Winnipeg general strike</a> of 1919. It began on 15 May and collapsed on 25 June 1919; as the workers gradually returned to their jobs, the Central Strike Committee decided to end the movement.

Government efforts to violently crush the strike, including a <a href="Royal%20Northwest%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Northwest Mounted Police</a> charge into a crowd of protesters that resulted in multiple casualties and one death, had led to the arrest of the movement's leaders. In the aftermath, eight leaders went on trial, and most were convicted on charges of <a href="sedition">seditious conspiracy</a>, illegal combinations, and seditious <a href="libel">libel</a>; four were aliens who were deported under the <a href="Canadian%20immigration%20and%20refugee%20law">Canadian Immigration Act</a>.

The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> (1929–c. 1939) hit especially hard in <a href="Western%20Canada">Western Canada</a>, including Manitoba. The collapse of the world market combined with a steep drop in agricultural production due to drought led to economic diversification, moving away from a reliance on wheat production. The <a href="Manitoba%20Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Manitoba Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a>, forerunner to the <a href="New%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Manitoba">New Democratic Party of Manitoba</a> (NDP), was founded in 1932.

Canada entered the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> in 1939. Winnipeg was one of the major commands for the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">British Commonwealth Air Training Plan</a> to train fighter pilots, and there were air training schools throughout Manitoba. Several Manitoba-based regiments were deployed overseas, including <a href="Princess%20Patricia%27s%20Canadian%20Light%20Infantry">Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry</a>. In an effort to raise money for the war effort, the <a href="Canada%20Savings%20Bond">Victory Loan</a> campaign organized "<a href="If%20Day">If Day</a>" in 1942. The event featured a simulated <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> invasion and occupation of Manitoba, and eventually raised over <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>65 million.
Winnipeg was inundated during the <a href="1950%20Red%20River%20Flood">1950 Red River Flood</a> and had to be partially evacuated. In that year, the Red River reached its highest level since 1861 and flooded most of the Red River Valley. The damage caused by the flood led then-Premier <a href="Dufferin%20Roblin">Duff Roblin</a> to advocate for the construction of the <a href="Red%20River%20Floodway">Red River Floodway</a>; it was completed in 1968 after six years of excavation. Permanent dikes were erected in eight towns south of Winnipeg, and clay dikes and diversion dams were built in the Winnipeg area. In 1997, the "<a href="1997%20Red%20River%20Flood">Flood of the Century</a>" caused over in damages in Manitoba, but the floodway prevented Winnipeg from flooding.

In 1990, Prime Minister <a href="Brian%20Mulroney">Brian Mulroney</a> attempted to pass the <a href="Meech%20Lake%20Accord">Meech Lake Accord</a>, a series of constitutional amendments to persuade <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> to endorse the <a href="Canada%20Act%201982">Canada Act 1982</a>. Unanimous support in the legislature was needed to bypass public consultation. <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Legislative%20Assembly">Manitoba politician</a> <a href="Elijah%20Harper">Elijah Harper</a>, a Cree, opposed because he did not believe First Nations had been adequately involved in the Accord's process, and thus the Accord failed.

In 2013, Manitoba was the second province to make accessibility legislation law, protecting the rights of persons with disabilities.

At the 2011 census, Manitoba had a population of 1,208,268, more than half of which is in the Winnipeg Capital Region; Winnipeg is Canada's eighth-largest Census Metropolitan Area, with a population of 730,018 (2011 Census). Although initial colonization of the province revolved mostly around homesteading, the last century has seen a shift towards urbanization; Manitoba is the only Canadian province with over fifty-five percent of its population located in a single city.

According to the <a href="Canada%202006%20Census">2006 Canadian census</a>, the largest ethnic group in Manitoba is <a href="English%20Canadian">English</a> (22.9%), followed by <a href="Canadians%20of%20German%20ethnicity">German</a> (19.1%), <a href="Scottish%20Canadian">Scottish</a> (18.5%), <a href="Ukrainian%20Canadian">Ukrainian</a> (14.7%), <a href="Irish%20Canadian">Irish</a> (13.4%), <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">North American Indian</a> (10.6%), <a href="Polish%20Canadians">Polish</a> (7.3%), <a href="M%C3%A9tis%20people%20%28Canada%29">Métis</a> (6.4%), <a href="French%20Canadian">French</a> (5.6%), <a href="Canadians%20of%20Dutch%20descent">Dutch</a> (4.9%), and <a href="Russians%20in%20Canada">Russian</a> (4.0%)<a href="Icelandic%20Canadians">Icelandic</a>(2,4%). Almost one-fifth of respondents also identified their ethnicity as "Canadian". There is a significant indigenous community: aboriginals (including Métis) are Manitoba's fastest-growing ethnic group, representing 13.6 percent of Manitoba's population as of 2001 (some reserves refused to allow census-takers to enumerate their populations or were otherwise incompletely counted). There is a significant <a href="Franco-Manitoban">Franco-Manitoban</a> minority (148,370) and a growing <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">aboriginal</a> population (192,865, including the Métis). <a href="Rural%20Municipality%20of%20Gimli">Gimli, Manitoba</a> is home to the largest <a href="Icelanders">Icelandic</a> community outside of <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>.

Most Manitobans belong to a Christian denomination: on the 2001 census, 758,760 Manitobans (68.7%) reported being Christian, followed by 13,040 (1.2%) Jewish, 5,745 (0.5%) Buddhist, 5,485 (0.5%) <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a>, 5,095 (0.5%) Muslim, 3,840 (0.3%) Hindu, 3,415 (0.3%) <a href="Native%20American%20religion">Aboriginal spirituality</a> and 995 (0.1%) <a href="paganism">pagan</a>. 201,825 Manitobans (18.3%) reported no religious affiliation. The largest Christian denominations by number of adherents were the <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Canada">Roman Catholic Church</a> with 292,970 (27%); the <a href="United%20Church%20of%20Canada">United Church of Canada</a> with 176,820 (16%); and the <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Canada">Anglican Church of Canada</a> with 85,890 (8%).

Manitoba has a moderately strong economy based largely on natural resources. Its <a href="Gross%20Domestic%20Product">Gross Domestic Product</a> was C$50.834 billion in 2008. The province's economy grew 2.4 percent in 2008, the third consecutive year of growth; in 2009, it neither increased nor decreased. The average individual income in Manitoba in 2006 was C$25,100 (compared to a national average of C$26,500), ranking fifth-highest among the provinces. As of October 2009, Manitoba's unemployment rate was 5.8 percent.

Manitoba's economy relies heavily on agriculture, tourism, energy, oil, mining, and forestry. Agriculture is vital and is found mostly in the southern half of the province, although grain farming occurs as far north as The Pas. Around 12 percent of Canadian farmland is in Manitoba. The most common type of farm found in rural areas is cattle farming (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%).

Manitoba is the nation's largest producer of <a href="sunflower%20seed">sunflower seed</a> and dry beans, and one of the leading sources of potatoes. Portage la Prairie is a major potato processing centre, and is home to the <a href="McCain%20Foods%20Limited">McCain Foods</a> and <a href="Simplot">Simplot</a> plants, which provide French fries for <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a>, <a href="Wendy%27s">Wendy's</a>, and other commercial restaurant chains. <a href="Viterra">Can-Oat Milling</a>, one of the largest oat mills in the world, also has a plant in the <a href="Rural%20municipality">municipality</a>.

Manitoba's largest employers are government and government-funded institutions, including <a href="crown%20corporations">crown corporations</a> and services like <a href="List%20of%20hospitals%20in%20Manitoba">hospitals</a> and <a href="List%20of%20universities%20in%20Manitoba">universities</a>. Major private-sector employers are <a href="The%20Great-West%20Life%20Assurance%20Company">The Great-West Life Assurance Company</a>, <a href="Cargill%20Ltd.">Cargill Ltd.</a>, and <a href="Richardson%20International">James Richardson and Sons Ltd.</a> Manitoba also has large manufacturing and tourism sectors. Churchill's Arctic wildlife is a major tourist attraction; the town is a world capital for polar bear and <a href="beluga%20whale">beluga whale</a> watchers. Manitoba is the only province with an Arctic deep-water seaport, at Churchill.

In January 2018, the <a href="Canadian%20Federation%20of%20Independent%20Business">Canadian Federation of Independent Business</a> claimed that Manitoba was the most improved province for tackling <a href="red%20tape">red tape</a>.

Manitoba's early economy depended on mobility and living off the land. Aboriginal Nations (Cree, Ojibwa, Dene, Sioux and Assiniboine) followed herds of bison and congregated to trade among themselves at key meeting places throughout the province. After the arrival of the first European traders in the 17th century, the economy centred on the trade of beaver pelts and other furs. Diversification of the economy came when Lord Selkirk brought the first agricultural settlers in 1811, though the triumph of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) over its competitors ensured the primacy of the fur trade over widespread agricultural colonization.

HBC control of Rupert's Land ended in 1868; when Manitoba became a province in 1870, all land became the property of the federal government, with homesteads granted to settlers for farming. Transcontinental railways were constructed to simplify trade. Manitoba's economy depended mainly on farming, which persisted until drought and the Great Depression led to further diversification.

<a href="CFB%20Winnipeg">CFB Winnipeg</a> is a <a href="Canadian%20Forces%20base">Canadian Forces Base</a> at the Winnipeg International Airport. The base is home to flight operations support divisions and several training schools, as well as the <a href="1%20Canadian%20Air%20Division">1 Canadian Air Division</a> and Canadian <a href="North%20American%20Aerospace%20Defense%20Command">NORAD</a> Region Headquarters. 17 Wing of the <a href="Canadian%20Forces">Canadian Forces</a> is based at CFB Winnipeg; the Wing has three squadrons and six schools. It supports 113 units from <a href="Thunder%20Bay">Thunder Bay</a> to the Saskatchewan/Alberta border, and from the <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49th parallel north</a> to the <a href="Northern%20Canada">high Arctic</a>. 17 Wing acts as a deployed operating base for <a href="CF-18%20Hornet">CF-18 Hornet</a> fighter–bombers assigned to the Canadian NORAD Region.

The two 17 Wing squadrons based in the city are: the 402 ("City of Winnipeg" Squadron), which flies the Canadian designed and produced <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada">de Havilland Canada</a> <a href="Bombardier%20Dash%208">CT-142 Dash 8</a> navigation trainer in support of the 1 Canadian Forces Flight Training School's Air Combat Systems Officer and Airborne Electronic Sensor Operator training programs (which trains all Canadian Air Combat Systems Officer); and the 435 ("Chinthe" Transport and Rescue Squadron), which flies the <a href="Lockheed%20Corporation">Lockheed</a> <a href="C-130%20Hercules">C-130 Hercules</a> tanker/transport in airlift <a href="search%20and%20rescue">search and rescue</a> roles, and is the only Air Force squadron equipped and trained to conduct <a href="Aerial%20refueling">air-to-air refuelling</a> of fighter aircraft.

<a href="CFB%20Shilo">Canadian Forces Base Shilo</a> (CFB Shilo) is an Operations and Training base of the Canadian Forces located east of Brandon. During the 1990s, Canadian Forces Base Shilo was designated as an Area Support Unit, acting as a local base of operations for Southwest Manitoba in times of military and civil emergency. CFB Shilo is the home of the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Horse%20Artillery">1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery</a>, both battalions of the <a href="1%20Canadian%20Mechanized%20Brigade%20Group">1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group</a>, and the <a href="Royal%20Regiment%20of%20Canadian%20Artillery">Royal Canadian Artillery</a>. The Second Battalion of <a href="Princess%20Patricia%27s%20Canadian%20Light%20Infantry">Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry</a> (2 PPCLI), which was originally stationed in Winnipeg (first at Fort Osborne, then in Kapyong Barracks), has operated out of CFB Shilo since 2004. CFB Shilo hosts a training unit, 3rd Canadian Division Training Centre. It serves as a base for support units of <a href="Land%20Force%20Western%20Area">3rd Canadian Division</a>, also including 3 CDSG Signals Squadron, Shared Services Unit (West), 11 CF Health Services Centre, 1 Dental Unit, 1 Military Police Regiment, and an Integrated Personnel Support Centre. The base currently houses 1,700 soldiers.

After the control of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba attained full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province carved out of the Northwest Territories. The <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Manitoba">Legislative Assembly of Manitoba</a> was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (<a href="Manitoba%20Liberal%20Party">Liberals</a> and <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Manitoba">Conservatives</a>). The <a href="Progressive%20Party%20of%20Manitoba">United Farmers of Manitoba</a> appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the <a href="New%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Manitoba">New Democratic Party of Manitoba</a> (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Progressive Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.

Like all Canadian provinces, Manitoba is governed by a <a href="unicameralism">unicameral legislative assembly</a>. The <a href="executive%20%28government%29">executive branch</a> is formed by the governing party; the <a href="party%20leader">party leader</a> is the <a href="premier%20of%20Manitoba">premier of Manitoba</a>, the head of the executive branch. The head of state, <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, is represented by the <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Manitoba">Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba</a>, who is appointed by the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of Canada</a> on advice of the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a>. The head of state is primarily a ceremonial role, although the <a href="List%20of%20lieutenant%20governors%20of%20Manitoba">Lieutenant Governor</a> has the official responsibility of ensuring that Manitoba has a duly constituted government.

The Legislative Assembly consists of the 57 Members elected to represent the people of Manitoba. The <a href="List%20of%20premiers%20of%20Manitoba">premier</a> of Manitoba is <a href="Brian%20Pallister">Brian Pallister</a> of the PC Party. The PCs were elected with a majority government of 40 seats. The NDP holds 14 seats, and the Liberal Party have three seats but does not have official party status in the Manitoba Legislature. The last provincial <a href="List%20of%20Manitoba%20general%20elections">general election</a> was held on 19 April 2016. The province is represented in federal politics by 14 <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">Members of Parliament</a> and six <a href="Senate%20of%20Canada">Senators</a>.

Manitoba's judiciary consists of the <a href="Manitoba%20Court%20of%20Appeal">Court of Appeal</a>, the <a href="Court%20of%20Queen%27s%20Bench%20of%20Manitoba">Court of Queen's Bench</a>, and the <a href="Provincial%20Court%20of%20Manitoba">Provincial Court</a>. The Provincial Court is primarily for criminal law; 95 percent of criminal cases in Manitoba are heard here. The Court of Queen's Bench is the highest trial court in the province. It has four jurisdictions: <a href="family%20law">family law</a> (<a href="child%20and%20family%20services">child and family services</a> cases), <a href="civil%20law%20%28common%20law%29">civil law</a>, <a href="criminal%20law">criminal law</a> (for <a href="indictable%20offence">indictable offence</a>s), and <a href="appeal">appeal</a>s. The Court of Appeal hears appeals from both benches; its decisions can only be appealed to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a>.

English and French are the official languages of the legislature and courts of Manitoba, according to <a href="%C2%A7">§</a>23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870 (part of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Canada">Constitution of Canada</a>). In April 1890, the Manitoba legislature attempted to abolish the official status of French, and ceased to publish bilingual legislation. However, in 1985 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the <a href="Reference%20re%20Manitoba%20Language%20Rights">Reference re Manitoba Language Rights</a> that §23 still applied, and that legislation published only in English was invalid (unilingual legislation was declared valid for a temporary period to allow time for translation).

Although French is an official language for the purposes of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require it to be an official language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.

In 2010, the provincial government of Manitoba passed the Aboriginal Languages Recognition Act, which gives official recognition to seven indigenous languages: <a href="Cree%20language">Cree</a>, <a href="Dakota%20language">Dakota</a>, <a href="Dene%20language">Dene</a>, <a href="Inuktitut">Inuktitut</a>, <a href="Michif">Michif</a>, <a href="Ojibway%20language">Ojibway</a> and <a href="Oji-Cree%20language">Oji-Cree</a>.

Transportation and warehousing contribute approximately to Manitoba's GDP. Total employment in the industry is estimated at 34,500, or around 5 percent of Manitoba's population. Trucks haul 95 percent of land freight in Manitoba, and trucking companies account for 80 percent of Manitoba's merchandise trade to the United States. Five of Canada's twenty-five largest employers in for-hire trucking are headquartered in Manitoba. of Manitoba's GDP comes directly or indirectly from trucking.

<a href="Greyhound%20Canada">Greyhound Canada</a> and <a href="Grey%20Goose%20Bus%20Lines">Grey Goose Bus Lines</a> offer domestic bus service from the <a href="Winnipeg%20Bus%20Terminal">Winnipeg Bus Terminal</a>. The terminal was relocated from <a href="downtown%20Winnipeg">downtown Winnipeg</a> to the airport in 2009, and is a Greyhound hub. Municipalities also operate localized transit bus systems.

Manitoba has two <a href="Class%20I%20railroad">Class I railways</a>: <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> (CN) and <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> (CPR). Winnipeg is centrally located on the main lines of both carriers, and both maintain large inter-modal terminals in the city. CN and CPR operate a combined of track in Manitoba. <a href="Via%20Rail">Via Rail</a> offers transcontinental and Northern Manitoba passenger service from <a href="Union%20Station%20%28Winnipeg%29">Winnipeg's Union Station</a>. Numerous small regional and short-line railways also run trains within Manitoba: the <a href="Hudson%20Bay%20Railway%20%281997%29">Hudson Bay Railway</a>, the <a href="Southern%20Manitoba%20Railway">Southern Manitoba Railway</a>, <a href="Burlington%20Northern%20Santa%20Fe%20Manitoba">Burlington Northern Santa Fe Manitoba</a>, <a href="Greater%20Winnipeg%20Water%20District%20Railway">Greater Winnipeg Water District Railway</a>, and <a href="Central%20Manitoba%20Railway">Central Manitoba Railway</a>. Together, these smaller lines operate approximately of track in the province.
<a href="Winnipeg%20James%20Armstrong%20Richardson%20International%20Airport">Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport</a>, Manitoba's largest <a href="List%20of%20airports%20in%20Manitoba">airport</a>, is one of only a few 24-hour unrestricted airports in Canada and is part of the <a href="National%20Airports%20System">National Airports System</a>. A new, larger terminal opened in October 2011. The airport handles approximately of cargo annually, making it the third largest cargo airport in the country.

Eleven regional passenger airlines and nine smaller and charter carriers operate out of the airport, as well as eleven air cargo carriers and seven freight forwarders. Winnipeg is a major sorting facility for both <a href="FedEx">FedEx</a> and <a href="Purolator%20Courier">Purolator</a>, and receives daily trans-border service from <a href="United%20Parcel%20Service">UPS</a>. <a href="Air%20Canada">Air Canada</a> Cargo and <a href="Cargojet%20Airways">Cargojet Airways</a> use the airport as a major hub for national traffic.

The <a href="Port%20of%20Churchill">Port of Churchill</a>, owned by <a href="OmniTRAX">OmniTRAX</a>, is the only <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> deep-water port in Canada. It is nautically closer to ports in <a href="Northern%20Europe">Northern Europe</a> and Russia than any other port in Canada. It has four deep-sea berths for the loading and unloading of grain, general cargo and tanker vessels. The port is served by the Hudson Bay Railway (also owned by OmniTRAX). Grain represented 90 percent of the port's traffic in the 2004 shipping season. In that year, over of agricultural products were shipped through the port.

The first school in Manitoba was founded in 1818 by Roman Catholic <a href="missionary">missionaries</a> in present-day Winnipeg; the first Protestant school was established in 1820. A provincial board of education was established in 1871; it was responsible for public schools and curriculum, and represented both Catholics and Protestants. The Manitoba Schools Question led to funding for French Catholic schools largely being withdrawn in favour of the English Protestant majority. Legislation making education compulsory for children between seven and fourteen was first enacted in 1916, and the leaving age was raised to sixteen in 1962.

Public schools in Manitoba fall under the regulation of one of thirty-seven <a href="List%20of%20school%20districts%20in%20Manitoba">school divisions</a> within <a href="Minister%20of%20Education%2C%20Citizenship%20and%20Youth%20%28Manitoba%29">the provincial education system</a> (except for the <a href="Manitoba%20Band%20Operated%20Schools">Manitoba Band Operated Schools</a>, which are administered by the federal government). Public schools follow a provincially mandated curriculum in either French or English. There are sixty-five funded independent schools in Manitoba, including three boarding schools. These schools must follow the Manitoban curriculum and meet other provincial requirements. There are forty-four non-funded independent schools, which are not required to meet those standards.

There are five universities in Manitoba, regulated by the <a href="Minister%20of%20Advanced%20Education%20and%20Literacy%20%28Manitoba%29">Ministry of Advanced Education and Literacy</a>. Four of these universities are in Winnipeg: the <a href="University%20of%20Manitoba">University of Manitoba</a>, the largest and most comprehensive; the <a href="University%20of%20Winnipeg">University of Winnipeg</a>, a <a href="liberal%20arts%20college">liberal arts school</a> primarily focused on <a href="undergrad">undergrad</a> studies located downtown; <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20de%20Saint-Boniface">Université de Saint-Boniface</a>, the province's only French-language university; and the <a href="Canadian%20Mennonite%20University">Canadian Mennonite University</a>, a religious-based institution. The Université de Saint-Boniface, established in 1818 and now affiliated with the University of Manitoba, is the oldest university in Western Canada. <a href="Brandon%20University">Brandon University</a>, formed in 1899 and located in Brandon, is the province's only university not in Winnipeg.

Manitoba has thirty-eight public libraries; of these, twelve have French-language collections and eight have significant collections in other languages. Twenty-one of these are part of the <a href="Winnipeg%20Public%20Library">Winnipeg Public Library</a> system. The first lending library in Manitoba was founded in 1848.

Manitoba's culture has been influenced by traditional (Aboriginal and Métis) and modern Canadian artistic values, as well as by the cultures of its <a href="immigrant">immigrant</a> populations and American neighbours. The <a href="Minister%20of%20Culture%2C%20Heritage%2C%20Tourism%20and%20Sport%20%28Manitoba%29">Minister of Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport</a> is responsible for promoting and, to some extent, financing Manitoban culture. Manitoba is the birthplace of the <a href="Red%20River%20Jig">Red River Jig</a>, a combination of aboriginal <a href="pow-wow">pow-wow</a>s and European <a href="Reel%20%28dance%29">reels</a> popular among early settlers. Manitoba's traditional music has strong roots in Métis and Aboriginal culture, in particular the <a href="old-time%20music">old-time</a> <a href="fiddle">fiddling</a> of the Métis. Manitoba's cultural scene also incorporates classical European traditions. The Winnipeg-based <a href="Royal%20Winnipeg%20Ballet">Royal Winnipeg Ballet</a> (RWB), is Canada's oldest ballet and North America's longest continuously operating <a href="ballet%20company">ballet company</a>; it was granted its royal title in 1953 under Queen Elizabeth II.

Today, the five-day festival is one of the largest folk festivals in North America with over 70 acts from around the world and an annual attendance that exceeds 80,000. The Winnipeg Folk Festival's home – Birds Hill Provincial Park – is located 34 kilometres outside of Winnipeg and for the five days of the festival, it becomes Manitoba's third largest "city." The <a href="Festival%20du%20Voyageur">Festival du Voyageur</a> is an annual ten-day event held in Winnipeg's French Quarter, and is Western Canada's largest winter festival.

Manitoban museums document different aspects of the province's heritage. The <a href="Manitoba%20Museum">Manitoba Museum</a> is the largest museum in Manitoba and focuses on Manitoban history from prehistory to the 1920s. The full-size replica of the Nonsuch is the museum's showcase piece. The <a href="Manitoba%20Children%27s%20Museum">Manitoba Children's Museum</a> at <a href="The%20Forks%2C%20Winnipeg">The Forks</a> presents exhibits for children.

Madagascar

Madagascar (; ), officially the Republic of Madagascar ( ; ), and previously known as the <a href="Malagasy%20Republic">Malagasy Republic</a>, is an <a href="island%20country">island country</a> in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, approximately off the coast of <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a>. The nation comprises the island of <a href="Geography%20of%20Madagascar">Madagascar</a> (the fourth-<a href="List%20of%20islands%20by%20area">largest island</a> in the world) and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the <a href="supercontinent">supercontinent</a> <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>, Madagascar split from the <a href="Indian%20peninsula">Indian subcontinent</a> around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a <a href="biodiversity%20hotspot">biodiversity hotspot</a>; over 90% of <a href="wildlife%20of%20Madagascar">its wildlife</a> is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.

The first archaeological evidence for human foraging on Madagascar may have occurred as much as 10,000 years ago. Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and 550 AD by <a href="Austronesian%20peoples">Austronesian peoples</a>, arriving on <a href="outrigger%20canoe">outrigger canoe</a>s from <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. These were joined around the 9th century AD by <a href="Bantu%20peoples">Bantu</a> migrants crossing the <a href="Mozambique%20Channel">Mozambique Channel</a> from East Africa. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The <a href="Malagasy%20people">Malagasy ethnic group</a> is often divided into 18 or more <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20of%20Madagascar">subgroups</a>, of which the largest are the <a href="Merina%20people">Merina</a> of the central highlands.

Until the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the <a href="Merina%20Kingdom">Kingdom of Madagascar</a> by a <a href="List%20of%20Malagasy%20monarchs">series</a> of Merina <a href="andriana">nobles</a>. The monarchy ended in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">French colonial empire</a>, from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a>. However, in a <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">popular uprising in 2009</a>, president <a href="Marc%20Ravalomanana">Marc Ravalomanana</a> was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to <a href="Andry%20Rajoelina">Andry Rajoelina</a>. Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014, when <a href="Hery%20Rajaonarimampianina">Hery Rajaonarimampianina</a> was named president following a <a href="Malagasy%20general%20election%2C%202013">2013 election</a> deemed fair and transparent by the international community. Madagascar is a member of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, the <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a> (AU), the <a href="Southern%20African%20Development%20Community">Southern African Development Community</a> (SADC), and the <a href="Organisation%20Internationale%20de%20la%20Francophonie">Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie</a>.

Madagascar belongs to the group of least developed countries, according to the United Nations. <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy</a> and <a href="French%20language">French</a> are both <a href="official%20language">official language</a>s of the state. The majority of the population adheres to <a href="Malagasy%20mythology">traditional beliefs</a>, <a href="Christianity%20in%20Madagascar">Christianity</a>, or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. , the economy has been weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the Malagasy population.

In the <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy language</a>, the island of Madagascar is called "Madagasikara" () and its people are referred to as "<a href="Malagasy%20people">Malagasy</a>". The island's appellation "Madagascar" is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> by Europeans. The name "Madageiscar" was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th-century Venetian explorer <a href="Marco%20Polo">Marco Polo</a> as a corrupted transliteration of the name <a href="Mogadishu">Mogadishu</a>, the <a href="Somalia">Somali</a> port with which Polo had confused the island.

On <a href="Lawrence%20of%20Rome">St. Laurence</a>'s Day in 1500, Portuguese explorer <a href="Diogo%20Dias">Diogo Dias</a> landed on the island and named it "São Lourenço". Polo's name was preferred and popularized on <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> maps. No single Malagasy-language name predating "Madagasikara" appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities had their own name for part or all of the land they inhabited.

At , Madagascar is the world's 47th <a href="largest%20country">largest country</a> and the <a href="list%20of%20islands%20by%20area">fourth-largest island</a>. The country lies mostly between latitudes <a href="12th%20parallel%20south">12°S</a> and <a href="26th%20parallel%20south">26°S</a>, and longitudes <a href="43rd%20meridian%20east">43°E</a> and <a href="51st%20meridian%20east">51°E</a>. Neighboring islands include the French territory of <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> and the country of <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> to the east, as well as the state of <a href="Comoros">Comoros</a> and the French territory of <a href="Mayotte">Mayotte</a> to the north west. The nearest mainland state is <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, located to the west.

The prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> separated the Madagascar–Antarctica–India landmass from the Africa–South America landmass around 135 million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88 million years ago during the late <a href="cretaceous%20period">cretaceous period</a> allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Along the length of the eastern coast runs a narrow and steep <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a> containing much of the island's remaining tropical <a href="Madagascar%20lowland%20forests">lowland forest</a>.

To the west of this ridge lies a <a href="plateau">plateau</a> in the center of the island ranging in altitude from above sea level. These <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">central highlands</a>, traditionally the homeland of the <a href="Merina%20people">Merina people</a> and the location of their historic capital at <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a>, are the most densely populated part of the island and are characterized by terraced, rice-growing valleys lying between grassy hills and patches of the <a href="Madagascar%20subhumid%20forests">subhumid forests</a> that formerly covered the highland region. To the west of the highlands, the increasingly arid terrain gradually slopes down to the <a href="Mozambique%20Channel">Mozambique Channel</a> and <a href="Madagascar%20mangroves">mangrove swamps</a> along the coast.

Madagascar's highest peaks rise from three prominent highland <a href="massif">massif</a>s: <a href="Maromokotro">Maromokotro</a> in the <a href="Tsaratanana%20Massif%23Tsaranoro%20Massif">Tsaratanana Massif</a> is the island's highest point, followed by Boby Peak in the <a href="Andringitra%20Massif">Andringitra Massif</a>, and Tsiafajavona in the <a href="Ankaratra">Ankaratra</a> Massif. To the east, the "<a href="Canal%20des%20Pangalanes">Canal des Pangalanes</a>" is a chain of man-made and natural lakes connected by canals built by the French just inland from the east coast and running parallel to it for some .

The western and southern sides, which lie in the <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a> of the central highlands, are home to <a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forests">dry deciduous forests</a>, <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20thickets">spiny forests</a>, and <a href="deserts%20and%20xeric%20shrublands">deserts and xeric shrublands</a>. Due to their lower population densities, Madagascar's dry deciduous forests have been better preserved than the eastern rain forests or the original woodlands of the central plateau. The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting is a major problem caused by <a href="sediment">sediment</a> from the high levels of inland <a href="erosion">erosion</a> carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.

The combination of southeastern <a href="trade%20winds">trade winds</a> and northwestern <a href="monsoons">monsoons</a> produces a hot rainy season (November–April) with frequently destructive <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a>s, and a relatively cooler dry season (May–October). Rain clouds originating over the Indian Ocean discharge much of their moisture over the island's eastern coast; the heavy precipitation supports the area's <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> ecosystem. The central highlands are both drier and cooler while the west is drier still, and a <a href="semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid climate</a> prevails in the southwest and southern interior of the island.

<a href="Tropical%20cyclone">Tropical cyclone</a>s cause damage to infrastructure and local economies as well as loss of life. In 2004, <a href="Cyclone%20Gafilo">Cyclone Gafilo</a> became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar. The storm killed 172 people, left 214,260 homeless and caused more than US$250 million in damage.

As a result of the island's long isolation from neighboring continents, Madagascar is home to various plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth. Approximately 90% of all plant and animal species found in Madagascar are <a href="endemism">endemic</a>. This distinctive ecology has led some ecologists to refer to Madagascar as the "eighth continent", and the island has been classified by <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a> as a biodiversity hotspot.

More than 80 percent of Madagascar's 14,883 <a href="flora%20of%20Madagascar">plant species</a> are found nowhere else in the world, including five plant families. The family "<a href="Didiereaceae">Didiereaceae</a>", composed of four genera and 11 species, is limited to the <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20thickets">spiny forests</a> of southwestern Madagascar. Four-fifths of the world's "<a href="Pachypodium">Pachypodium</a>" species are endemic to the island. Three-fourths of Madagascar's 860 <a href="orchid">orchid</a> species are found here alone, as are six of the world's nine <a href="Adansonia">baobab</a> species. The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic. Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs <a href="vinblastine">vinblastine</a> and <a href="vincristine">vincristine</a> are <a href="vinca%20alkaloid">"vinca" alkaloids</a>, used to treat <a href="Hodgkin%27s%20disease">Hodgkin's disease</a>, <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a>, and other cancers, were derived from the <a href="Catharanthus">Madagascar periwinkle</a>. The <a href="Ravenala%20madagascariensis">traveler's palm</a>, known locally as "ravinala" and endemic to the eastern rain forests, is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the <a href="Air%20Madagascar">Air Madagascar</a> logo.

Like its flora, Madagascar's fauna is diverse and exhibits a high rate of endemism. Lemurs have been characterized as "Madagascar's flagship mammal species" by Conservation International. In the absence of monkeys and other competitors, these <a href="primate">primate</a>s have adapted to a wide range of habitats and diversified into numerous species. , there were officially <a href="List%20of%20lemur%20species">103 species and subspecies of lemur</a>, 39 of which were described by zoologists between 2000 and 2008. They are almost all classified as rare, vulnerable, or endangered. At least 17 species of lemur have become extinct since humans arrived on Madagascar, all of which were larger than the surviving lemur species.

A number of other mammals, including the cat-like <a href="Fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a>, are endemic to Madagascar. Over 300 species of birds have been recorded on the island, of which over 60 percent (including four families and 42 genera) are endemic. The few families and genera of <a href="reptile">reptile</a> that have reached Madagascar have diversified into more than 260 species, with over 90 percent of these being endemic (including one endemic family). The island is home to two-thirds of the world's <a href="chameleon">chameleon</a> species, including the <a href="Brookesia%20micra">smallest known</a>, and researchers have proposed that Madagascar may be the origin of all chameleons.

Endemic fish of Madagascar include two families, 15 genera and over 100 species, primarily inhabiting the island's freshwater lakes and rivers. Although invertebrates remain poorly studied on Madagascar, researchers have found high rates of endemism among the known species. All 651 species of terrestrial snail are endemic, as are a majority of the island's butterflies, <a href="Scarabaeidae">scarab beetles</a>, <a href="lacewing">lacewing</a>s, spiders and dragonflies.

Madagascar's varied fauna and flora are endangered by human activity. Since the arrival of humans around 2,350 years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90 percent of its original forest. This forest loss is largely fueled by "tavy" ("fat"), a traditional <a href="slash-and-burn">slash-and-burn</a> agricultural practice imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers. Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice not only for its practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom ("fomba malagasy"). As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1,400 years ago. By the 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests. More recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1,000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a <a href="cash%20crop">cash crop</a> over the past century. According to a conservative estimate, about 40 percent of the island's original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80 percent. In addition to traditional agricultural practice, wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President <a href="Marc%20Ravalomanana">Marc Ravalomanana</a> from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of <a href="Andry%20Rajoelina">Andry Rajoelina</a> as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.

Invasive species have likewise been introduced by human populations. Following the 2014 discovery in Madagascar of the <a href="Duttaphrynus%20melanostictus">Asian common toad</a>, a relative of a toad species that has severely harmed wildlife in Australia since the 1930s, researchers warned the toad could "wreak havoc on the country's unique fauna." Habitat destruction and hunting have threatened many of Madagascar's endemic species or driven them to extinction. The island's <a href="elephant%20bird">elephant bird</a>s, a family of endemic giant <a href="ratite">ratite</a>s, became extinct in the 17th century or earlier, most probably because of human hunting of adult birds and poaching of their large eggs for food. Numerous <a href="Subfossil%20lemur">giant lemur</a> species vanished with the arrival of human settlers to the island, while others became extinct over the course of the centuries as a growing human population put greater pressures on lemur habitats and, among some populations, increased the rate of lemur hunting for food. A July 2012 assessment found that the exploitation of natural resources since 2009 has had dire consequences for the island's wildlife: 90 percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, the highest proportion of any mammalian group. Of these, 23 species were classified as critically endangered. By contrast, a previous study in 2008 had found only 38 percent of lemur species were at risk of extinction.

In 2003, Ravalomanana announced the Durban Vision, an initiative to more than triple the island's <a href="National%20parks%20of%20Madagascar">protected natural areas</a> to over or 10 percent of Madagascar's land surface. , areas protected by the state included five Strict Nature Reserves ("Réserves Naturelles Intégrales"), 21 Wildlife Reserves ("Réserves Spéciales") and 21 National Parks ("Parcs Nationaux"). In 2007 six of the national parks were declared a joint <a href="List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20Madagascar">World Heritage Site</a> under the name <a href="Rainforests%20of%20the%20Atsinanana">Rainforests of the Atsinanana</a>. These parks are <a href="Marojejy%20National%20Park">Marojejy</a>, <a href="Masoala%20National%20Park">Masoala</a>, <a href="Ranomafana%20National%20Park">Ranomafana</a>, <a href="Zahamena%20National%20Park">Zahamena</a>, <a href="Andohahela%20National%20Park">Andohahela</a> and <a href="Andringitra%20National%20Park">Andringitra</a>. Local timber merchants are harvesting scarce species of rosewood trees from protected rainforests within Marojejy National Park and exporting the wood to China for the production of luxury furniture and musical instruments. To raise public awareness of Madagascar's environmental challenges, the <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Society">Wildlife Conservation Society</a> opened an exhibit entitled ""Madagascar!"" in June 2008 at the <a href="Bronx%20Zoo">Bronx Zoo</a> in New York.

Archaeological finds such as cut marks on bones found in the northwest and stone tools in the northeast indicate that Madagascar was visited by foragers around 2000 BC. Early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> humans might have existed on the island 10,500 years ago, based on grooves found on <a href="elephant%20bird">elephant bird</a> bones left by humans. However, a counter study concluded that human-made marks date to 1,200 years ago at the earliest, in which the previously mentioned bone damage may have been made by scavengers, ground movements or cuts from the excavation process.

Traditionally, archaeologists have estimated that the earliest settlers arrived in successive waves throughout the period between 350 BC and 550 AD, while others are cautious about dates earlier than 250 AD. In either case, these dates make Madagascar one of the last major landmasses on Earth to be settled by humans.

Upon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture to clear the coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna, including <a href="Subfossil%20lemur">giant lemurs</a>, <a href="elephant%20bird">elephant bird</a>s, <a href="giant%20fossa">giant fossa</a> and the <a href="Malagasy%20hippopotamus">Malagasy hippopotamus</a>, which have since become extinct because of hunting and habitat destruction. By 600 AD, groups of these early settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Arab traders first reached the island between the 7th and 9th centuries. A wave of <a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu</a>-speaking migrants from southeastern Africa arrived around 1000 AD. South Indian Tamil merchants arrived around 11th century. They introduced the <a href="zebu">zebu</a>, a type of long-horned humped cattle, which they kept in large herds. Irrigated paddy fields were developed in the central highland <a href="Betsileo">Betsileo</a> Kingdom and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of <a href="Imerina">Imerina</a> a century later. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century. The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1,000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the <a href="Vazimba">Vazimba</a>. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings <a href="Andriamanelo">Andriamanelo</a>, <a href="Ralambo">Ralambo</a> and <a href="Andrianjaka">Andrianjaka</a> in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, the spirits of the Vazimba are revered as "tompontany" (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.

Madagascar was an important transoceanic trading hub connecting ports of the Indian Ocean in the early centuries following human settlement. The <a href="recorded%20history">written history</a> of Madagascar began with the Arabs, who established trading posts along the northwest coast by at least the 10th century and introduced <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, the <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic script</a> (used to transcribe the Malagasy language in a form of writing known as "<a href="sorabe">sorabe</a>"), Arab astrology, and other cultural elements. European contact began in 1500, when the <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> sea captain <a href="Diogo%20Dias">Diogo Dias</a> sighted the island. The French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.

From about 1774 to 1824, Madagascar gained prominence among pirates and European traders, particularly those involved in the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">trans-Atlantic slave trade</a>. The small island of <a href="%C3%8Ele%20Sainte-Marie">Nosy Boroha</a> off the northeastern coast of Madagascar has been proposed by some historians as the site of the legendary pirate utopia of <a href="Libertalia">Libertalia</a>. Many European sailors were shipwrecked on the coasts of the island, among them <a href="Robert%20Drury%20%28sailor%29">Robert Drury</a>, whose journal is one of the few written depictions of life in southern Madagascar during the 18th century. The wealth generated by maritime trade spurred the rise of organized kingdoms on the island, some of which had grown quite powerful by the 17th century. Among these were the <a href="Betsimisaraka%20people">Betsimisaraka</a> alliance of the eastern coast and the <a href="Sakalava">Sakalava</a> chiefdoms of <a href="Menabe">Menabe</a> and <a href="Boina%20Kingdom">Boina</a> on the west coast. The Kingdom of Imerina, located in the central highlands with its capital at the <a href="Rova%20of%20Antananarivo">royal palace</a> of Antananarivo, emerged at around the same time under the leadership of King Andriamanelo.

Upon its emergence in the early 17th century, the highland kingdom of Imerina was initially a minor power relative to the larger coastal kingdoms and grew even weaker in the early 18th century when King <a href="Andriamasinavalona">Andriamasinavalona</a> divided it among his four sons. Following almost a century of warring and famine, Imerina was reunited in 1793 by King <a href="Andrianampoinimerina">Andrianampoinimerina</a> (1787–1810). From his initial capital <a href="Ambohimanga">Ambohimanga</a>, and later from the <a href="Rova%20of%20Antananarivo">Rova of Antananarivo</a>, this Merina king rapidly expanded his rule over neighboring principalities. His ambition to bring the entire island under his control was largely achieved by his son and successor, King <a href="Radama%20I">Radama I</a> (1810–28), who was recognized by the British government as King of Madagascar. Radama concluded a treaty in 1817 with the British governor of <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> to abolish the lucrative slave trade in return for British military and financial assistance. Artisan missionary envoys from the <a href="London%20Missionary%20Society">London Missionary Society</a> began arriving in 1818 and included such key figures as <a href="James%20Cameron%20%28missionary%29">James Cameron</a>, <a href="David%20Jones%20%28missionary%29">David Jones</a> and <a href="David%20Griffiths%20%28missionary%29">David Griffiths</a>, who established schools, transcribed the <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy language</a> using the <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Roman alphabet</a>, translated the Bible, and introduced a variety of new technologies to the island.

Radama's successor, Queen <a href="Ranavalona%20I">Ranavalona I</a> (1828–61), responded to increasing political and cultural encroachment on the part of Britain and France by issuing a royal edict prohibiting the practice of <a href="Christianity%20in%20Madagascar">Christianity in Madagascar</a> and pressuring most foreigners to leave the territory. She made heavy use of the traditional practice of "<a href="Corv%C3%A9e">fanompoana</a>" (forced labor as tax payment) to complete public works projects and develop a standing army of between 20,000 and 30,000 <a href="Merina">Merina</a> soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand the Kingdom of Merina to encompass most of Madagascar. Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of "<a href="tangena">tangena</a>" was routinely obligatory. Between 1828 and 1861, the "tangena" ordeal caused about 3,000 deaths annually. In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina died as a result of the tangena ordeal, constituting roughly 20 percent of the population. The combination of regular warfare, disease, difficult forced labor and harsh measures of justice resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign. Among those who continued to reside in Imerina were <a href="Jean%20Laborde">Jean Laborde</a>, an entrepreneur who developed munitions and other industries on behalf of the monarchy, and <a href="Joseph-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Lambert">Joseph-François Lambert</a>, a French adventurer and slave trader, with whom then-Prince <a href="Radama%20II">Radama II</a> signed a controversial trade agreement termed the Lambert Charter. Succeeding his mother, Radama II (1861–63) attempted to relax the queen's stringent policies, but was <a href="Radama%20II%23Assassination%20plot">overthrown</a> two years later by Prime Minister <a href="Rainivoninahitriniony">Rainivoninahitriniony</a> (1852–1865) and an alliance of "<a href="Andriana">Andriana</a>" (noble) and "<a href="Hova%20%28Madagascar%29">Hova</a>" (commoner) courtiers, who sought to end the absolute power of the monarch.

Following the coup, the courtiers offered Radama's queen <a href="Rasoherina">Rasoherina</a> (1863–68) the opportunity to rule, if she would accept a power sharing arrangement with the Prime Minister—a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them. Queen Rasoherina accepted, first wedding Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and wedding his brother, Prime Minister <a href="Rainilaiarivony">Rainilaiarivony</a> (1864–95), who would go on to marry Queen <a href="Ranavalona%20II">Ranavalona II</a> (1868–83) and Queen <a href="Ranavalona%20III">Ranavalona III</a> (1883–97) in succession. Over the course of Rainilaiarivony's 31-year tenure as prime minister, numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government. Schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory. Army organization was improved, and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers. <a href="Polygamy">Polygamy</a> was outlawed and Christianity, declared the official religion of the court in 1869, was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace. Legal codes were reformed on the basis of British <a href="common%20law">common law</a> and three European-style courts were established in the capital city. In his joint role as Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of Madagascar against several French colonial incursions.

Primarily on the basis that the Lambert Charter had not been respected, France invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the first <a href="Franco-Hova%20War">Franco-Hova War</a>. At the end of the war, Madagascar ceded the northern port town of <a href="Antsiranana">Antsiranana</a> (Diego Suarez) to France and paid 560,000 francs to Lambert's heirs. In 1890, the British accepted the full formal imposition of a French <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> on the island, but French authority was not acknowledged by the government of Madagascar. To force capitulation, the French bombarded and occupied the harbor of <a href="Toamasina">Toamasina</a> on the east coast, and <a href="Mahajanga">Mahajanga</a> on the west coast, in December 1894 and January 1895 respectively.

A French military <a href="flying%20column">flying column</a> then marched toward Antananarivo, losing many men to malaria and other diseases. Reinforcements came from <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> and <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>. Upon reaching the city in September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender. France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion Island</a> and to Algeria. A two-year <a href="Menalamba%20rebellion">resistance movement</a> organized in response to the French capture of the royal palace was effectively put down at the end of 1897.

Under colonial rule, plantations were established for the production of a variety of export crops. <a href="Slavery">Slavery</a> was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed; many remained in their former masters' homes as servants or as sharecroppers; in many parts of the island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still held today. Wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of Antananarivo and the Rova palace compound was turned into a museum. Additional schools were built, particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the Merina had not reached. Education became mandatory between the ages of 6 to 13 and focused primarily on French language and practical skills.

The Merina royal tradition of <a href="Corv%C3%A9e">taxes paid in the form of labor</a> was continued under the French and used to construct a railway and roads linking key coastal cities to Antananarivo. Malagasy troops fought for France in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. In the 1930s, <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> political thinkers developed the <a href="Madagascar%20Plan">Madagascar Plan</a> that had identified the island as a potential site for the deportation of Europe's Jews. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the island was the site of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Madagascar">Battle of Madagascar</a> between the <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy government</a> and the British.

The occupation of France during the Second World War tarnished the prestige of the colonial administration in Madagascar and galvanized the growing independence movement, leading to the <a href="Malagasy%20Uprising">Malagasy Uprising</a> of 1947. This movement led the French to establish reformed institutions in 1956 under the "<a href="Loi%20Cadre">Loi Cadre</a>" (Overseas Reform Act), and Madagascar moved peacefully towards independence. The <a href="Malagasy%20Republic">Malagasy Republic</a> was proclaimed on 14 October 1958, as an <a href="autonomous%20entity">autonomous</a> state within the <a href="French%20Community">French Community</a>. A period of provisional government ended with the adoption of a constitution in 1959 and full independence on 26 June 1960.

Since regaining independence, Madagascar has transitioned through four republics with corresponding revisions to its constitution. The <a href="Malagasy%20Republic">First Republic</a> (1960–72), under the leadership of French-appointed President <a href="Philibert%20Tsiranana">Philibert Tsiranana</a>, was characterized by a continuation of strong economic and political ties to France. Many high-level technical positions were filled by French expatriates, and French teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country. Popular resentment over Tsiranana's tolerance for this "neo-colonial" arrangement inspired a <a href="rotaka">series of farmer and student protests</a> that overturned his administration in 1972.

<a href="Gabriel%20Ramanantsoa">Gabriel Ramanantsoa</a>, a major general in the army, was appointed interim president and prime minister that same year, but low public approval forced him to step down in 1975. Colonel <a href="Richard%20Ratsimandrava">Richard Ratsimandrava</a>, appointed to succeed him, was assassinated six days into his tenure. General <a href="Gilles%20Andriamahazo">Gilles Andriamahazo</a> ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral <a href="Didier%20Ratsiraka">Didier Ratsiraka</a>, who ushered in the socialist-Marxist <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Madagascar">Second Republic</a> that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.

This period saw a political alignment with the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a>, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a sharp decline in living standards, and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> and various bilateral donors in exchange for their bailout of the nation's broken economy.

Ratsiraka's dwindling popularity in the late 1980s reached a critical point in 1991 when presidential guards opened fire on unarmed protesters during a rally. Within two months, a transitional government had been established under the leadership of <a href="Albert%20Zafy">Albert Zafy</a> (1993–96), who went on to win the 1992 presidential elections and inaugurate the <a href="Third%20Republic%20of%20Madagascar">Third Republic</a> (1992–2010). The new <a href="constitution%20of%20Madagascar">Madagascar constitution</a> established a multi-party democracy and a separation of powers that placed significant control in the hands of the National Assembly. The new constitution also emphasized human rights, social and political freedoms, and free trade. Zafy's term, however, was marred by economic decline, allegations of corruption, and his introduction of legislation to give himself greater powers. He was consequently impeached in 1996, and an interim president, <a href="Norbert%20Ratsirahonana">Norbert Ratsirahonana</a>, was appointed for the three months prior to the next presidential election. Ratsiraka was then voted back into power on a platform of decentralization and economic reforms for a second term which lasted from 1996 to 2001.

The contested <a href="Malagasy%20presidential%20election%2C%202001">2001 presidential elections</a> in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, Marc Ravalomanana, eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative economic impact of the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and ecotourism, facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7 percent per year under his administration. In the later half of his second term, Ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption.

Opposition leader and then-mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, led a <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">movement in early 2009</a> in which Ravalomanana was pushed from power in an unconstitutional process widely condemned as a "coup d'état". In March 2009, Rajoelina was declared by the Supreme Court as the President of the <a href="High%20Transitional%20Authority">High Transitional Authority</a>, an interim governing body responsible for moving the country toward presidential elections. In 2010, a new constitution was <a href="Malagasy%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%202010">adopted by referendum</a>, establishing a Fourth Republic, which sustained the democratic, multi-party structure established in the previous constitution. <a href="Hery%20Rajaonarimampianina">Hery Rajaonarimampianina</a> was declared the winner of the <a href="Malagasy%20general%20election%2C%202013">2013 presidential election</a>, which the international community deemed fair and transparent.

Madagascar is a <a href="semi-presidential%20system">semi-presidential</a> <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democratic</a> <a href="Diversity%20%28politics%29">multi-party</a> republic, wherein the popularly elected president is the head of state and selects a <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Madagascar">prime minister</a>, who recommends candidates to the president to form his cabinet of ministers. According to the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Madagascar">constitution</a>, executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the ministerial cabinet, the <a href="Senate%20of%20Madagascar">Senate</a> and the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Madagascar">National Assembly</a>, although in reality these two latter bodies have very little power or legislative role. The constitution establishes independent executive, legislative and judicial branches and mandates a popularly elected president limited to three five-year terms.

The public directly elects the president and the 127 members of the National Assembly to five-year terms. All 33 members of the Senate serve six-year terms, with 22 senators elected by local officials and 11 appointed by the president. The last National Assembly election was held on 20 December 2013 and the last Senate election was held on 30 December 2015.

At the local level, the island's 22 provinces are administered by a governor and provincial council. Provinces are further subdivided into regions and communes. The judiciary is modeled on the French system, with a High Constitutional Court, High Court of Justice, Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, criminal tribunals, and tribunals of first instance. The courts, which adhere to <a href="Civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">civil law</a>, lack the capacity to quickly and transparently try the cases in the judicial system, often forcing defendants to pass lengthy pretrial detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons.

Antananarivo is the administrative capital and largest city of Madagascar. It is located in the highlands region, near the geographic center of the island. King Andrianjaka founded Antananarivo as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of <a href="Twelve%20sacred%20hills%20of%20Imerina%23Hill%20of%20Analamanga">Analamanga</a>. As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, Antananarivo became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants. The next largest cities are <a href="Antsirabe">Antsirabe</a> (500,000), <a href="Toamasina">Toamasina</a> (450,000) and <a href="Mahajanga">Mahajanga</a> (400,000).

Since Madagascar gained independence from France in 1960, the island's political transitions have been marked by numerous popular protests, several disputed elections, an impeachment, two military coups and one assassination. The island's recurrent political crises are often prolonged, with detrimental effects on the local economy, international relations and Malagasy living standards. The eight-month standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana following the 2001 presidential elections cost Madagascar millions of dollars in lost tourism and trade revenue as well as damage to infrastructure, such as bombed bridges and buildings damaged by arson. <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20protests">A series of protests</a> led by Andry Rajoelina against Ravalomanana in early 2009 became violent, with more than 170 people killed. Modern politics in Madagascar are colored by the history of Merina subjugation of coastal communities under their rule in the 19th century. The consequent tension between the highland and coastal populations has periodically flared up into isolated events of violence.

Madagascar has historically been perceived as being on the margin of mainstream African affairs despite being a founding member of the <a href="Organisation%20of%20African%20Unity">Organisation of African Unity</a>, which was established in 1963 and dissolved in 2002 to be replaced by the <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a>. Madagascar was not permitted to attend the first African Union summit because of a dispute over the results of the 2001 presidential election, but rejoined the African Union in July 2003 after a 14-month hiatus. Madagascar was again suspended by the African Union in March 2009 following the <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">unconstitutional transfer of executive power</a> to Rajoelina. Madagascar is a member of the <a href="International%20Criminal%20Court">International Criminal Court</a> with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the <a href="United%20States%20military">United States military</a>. Eleven countries have established embassies in Madagascar, including France, the United Kingdom, the United States, China and India, while Madagascar has <a href="List%20of%20diplomatic%20missions%20of%20Madagascar">embassies in sixteen other countries</a>.

Human rights in Madagascar are protected under the constitution and the state is a signatory to numerous international agreements including the <a href="Universal%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> and the <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Rights%20of%20the%20Child">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a>. Religious, ethnic and sexual minorities are protected under the law. Freedom of association and assembly are also guaranteed under the law, although in practice the denial of permits for public assembly has occasionally been used to impede political demonstrations. Torture by security forces is rare and state repression is low relative to other countries with comparably few legal safeguards, although arbitrary arrests and the corruption of military and police officers remain problems. Ravalomanana's 2004 creation of BIANCO, an anti-corruption bureau, resulted in reduced corruption among Antananarivo's lower-level bureaucrats in particular, although high-level officials have not been prosecuted by the bureau.

The rise of centralized kingdoms among the Sakalava, Merina and other ethnic groups produced the island's first standing armies by the 16th century, initially equipped with spears but later with muskets, cannons and other firearms. By the early 19th century, the Merina sovereigns of the Kingdom of Madagascar had brought much of the island under their control by mobilizing an army of trained and armed soldiers numbering as high as 30,000. French attacks on coastal towns in the later part of the century prompted then-Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to solicit British assistance to provide training to the Merina monarchy's army. Despite the training and leadership provided by British military advisers, the Malagasy army was unable to withstand French weaponry and was forced to surrender following an attack on the royal palace at Antananarivo. Madagascar was declared a colony of France in 1897.

The political independence and sovereignty of the Malagasy armed forces, which comprises an army, navy and air force, was restored with independence from France in 1960. Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders, but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. Under the socialist Second Republic, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender, a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991. The armed forces are under the direction of the Minister of the Interior and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis, as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections, when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate. This tradition was broken in 2009, when a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power.

The Minister of the Interior is responsible for the national police force, paramilitary force ("gendarmerie") and the secret police. The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps. Traditional community tribunals, called "dina", are presided over by elders and other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island. Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing. Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.

Madagascar is subdivided into 22 regions ("faritra"). The regions are further subdivided into 119 districts, 1,579 communes, and 17,485 "fokontany".

Agriculture has long influenced settlement on the island. Only 15% of the nation's 24,894,551 population live in the 10 largest cities.

Madagascar became a Member State of the United Nations on 20 September 1960, shortly after gaining its independence on 26 June 1960. As of January 2017, 34 police officers from Madagascar are deployed in Haiti as part of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Stabilisation%20Mission%20in%20Haiti">United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti</a>. Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development/ reconstruction efforts and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar. These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country. Small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both the quantity and quality of their production, as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.

During Madagascar's First Republic, France heavily influenced Madagascar's economic planning and policy and served as its key trading partner. Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was a key factor in launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import–export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75 percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50 percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.

The IMF forced Madagascar's government to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization of the economy when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized over the course of the 1980s. The political crisis of 1991 led to the suspension of IMF and World Bank assistance. Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. The IMF agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration. Having met a set of stringent economic, governance and human rights criteria, Madagascar became the first country to benefit from the <a href="Millennium%20Challenge%20Account">Millennium Challenge Account</a> in 2005.

Madagascar's GDP in 2015 was estimated at US$9.98 billion, with a per capita GDP of $411.82. Approximately 69 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line threshold of one dollar per day. Over the last five years, the average growth rate has been 2.6% but is expected to have reached 4.1% in 2016, due to public works programs and a growth of the service sector. The agriculture sector constituted 29 percent of Malagasy GDP in 2011, while manufacturing formed 15 percent of GDP. Madagascar's other sources of growth are tourism, agriculture and the extractive industries. Tourism focuses on the niche eco-tourism market, capitalizing on Madagascar's unique biodiversity, unspoiled natural habitats, national parks and lemur species. An estimated 365,000 tourists visited Madagascar in 2008, but the sector declined during the political crisis with 180,000 tourists visiting in 2010. However, the sector has been growing steadily for a few years; In 2016, 293,000 tourists landed in the African island with an increase of 20% compared to 2015; For 2017 the country has the goal of reaching 366,000 visitors, while for 2018 government estimates are expected to reach 500,000 annual tourists.

The island is still a very poor country in 2018; structural brakes remain in the development of the economy: corruption and the shackles of the public administration, lack of legal certainty, and backwardness of land legislation. The economy, however, has been growing since 2011, with GDP growth exceeding 4% per year; almost all economic indicators are growing, the GDP per capita was around $1600 (PPP) for 2017, one of the lowest in the world, although growing since 2012; unemployment was also cut, which in 2016 was equal to 2.1% with a work force of 13.4 million as of 2017. The main economic resources of Madagascar are <a href="Tourism%20in%20Madagascar">tourism</a>, <a href="Textile%20industry">textiles</a>, <a href="Agriculture%20in%20Madagascar">agriculture</a>, and <a href="Mining%20industry%20of%20Madagascar">mining</a>.

Madagascar's natural resources include a variety of unprocessed agricultural and mineral resources. Agriculture (including the growing of <a href="raffia">raffia</a>), fishing and <a href="forestry">forestry</a> are mainstays of the economy. Madagascar is the world's principal supplier of <a href="vanilla">vanilla</a>, cloves and <a href="ylang-ylang">ylang-ylang</a>. Madagascar supplies 80% of the world's natural vanilla. Other key agricultural resources include coffee, <a href="lychee">lychee</a>s and shrimp. Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones, and Madagascar currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires, which were discovered near <a href="Ilakaka">Ilakaka</a> in the late 1990s.

Madagascar has one of the world's largest reserves of <a href="ilmenite">ilmenite</a> (titanium ore), as well as important reserves of chromite, coal, iron, cobalt, copper and nickel. Several major projects are underway in the mining, <a href="Petroleum">oil</a> and <a href="Natural%20gas">gas</a> sectors that are anticipated to give a significant boost to the Malagasy economy. These include such projects as ilmenite and zircon mining from heavy mineral sands near <a href="T%C3%B4lanaro">Tôlanaro</a> by <a href="Rio%20Tinto%20Group">Rio Tinto</a>, extraction of nickel near <a href="Moramanga">Moramanga</a> and its processing near Toamasina by <a href="Sherritt%20International">Sherritt International</a>, and the development of the giant onshore <a href="heavy%20crude%20oil">heavy oil</a> deposits at <a href="Tsimiroro">Tsimiroro</a> and <a href="Bemolanga">Bemolanga</a> by <a href="Madagascar%20Oil">Madagascar Oil</a>.

Exports formed 28 percent of GDP in 2009. Most of the country's export revenue is derived from the textiles industry, fish and shellfish, vanilla, cloves and other foodstuffs. France is Madagascar's main trading partner, although the United States, Japan and Germany also have strong economic ties to the country. The <a href="Madagascar-U.S.%20Business%20Council">Madagascar-U.S. Business Council</a> was formed in May 2003, as a collaboration between <a href="USAID">USAID</a> and Malagasy artisan producers to support the export of local handicrafts to foreign markets. Imports of such items as foodstuffs, fuel, capital goods, vehicles, consumer goods and electronics consume an estimated 52 percent of GDP. The main sources of Madagascar's imports include China, France, Iran, Mauritius and Hong Kong.

In 2010, Madagascar had approximately of paved roads, of railways and of navigable waterways. The majority of roads in Madagascar are unpaved, with many becoming impassable in the rainy season. Largely paved national routes connect the six largest regional towns to Antananarivo, with minor paved and unpaved routes providing access to other population centers in each district.

There are several rail lines. Antananarivo is connected to Toamasina, Ambatondrazaka and Antsirabe by rail, and another rail line connects Fianarantsoa to Manakara. The most important seaport in Madagascar is located on the east coast at Toamasina. Ports at Mahajanga and Antsiranana are significantly less used because of their remoteness. The island's newest port at Ehoala, constructed in 2008 and privately managed by Rio Tinto, will come under state control upon completion of the company's mining project near Tôlanaro around 2038. <a href="Air%20Madagascar">Air Madagascar</a> services the island's many small regional airports, which offer the only practical means of access to many of the more remote regions during rainy season road washouts.

Running water and electricity are supplied at the national level by a government service provider, <a href="Jirama">Jirama</a>, which is unable to service the entire population. , only 6.8 percent of Madagascar's "fokontany" had access to water provided by Jirama, while 9.5 percent had access to its electricity services. Fifty-six percent of Madagascar's power is provided by hydroelectric power plants, with the remaining 44% provided by diesel engine generators. Mobile telephone and internet access are widespread in urban areas but remain limited in rural parts of the island. Approximately 30% of the districts are able to access the nations' several private telecommunications networks via mobile telephones or land lines.

Radio broadcasts remain the principal means by which the Malagasy population access international, national, and local news. Only state radio broadcasts are transmitted across the entire island. Hundreds of public and private stations with local or regional range provide alternatives to state broadcasting. In addition to the state television channel, a variety of privately owned television stations broadcast local and international programming throughout Madagascar. Several media outlets are owned by political partisans or politicians themselves, including the media groups MBS (owned by Ravalomanana) and Viva (owned by Rajoelina), contributing to political polarization in reporting.

The media have historically come under varying degrees of pressure to censor their criticism of the government. Reporters are occasionally threatened or harassed, and media outlets are periodically forced to close. Accusations of media censorship have increased since 2009 because of the alleged intensification of restrictions on political criticism. Access to the internet has grown dramatically over the past decade, with an estimated 352,000 residents of Madagascar accessing the internet from home or in one of the nation's many internet cafés in December 2011.

Medical centers, dispensaries and hospitals are found throughout the island, although they are concentrated in urban areas and particularly in Antananarivo. Access to medical care remains beyond the reach of many Malagasy, especially in the rural areas, and many recourse to traditional healers. In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low. In 2010, Madagascar had an average of three hospital beds per 10,000 people and a total of 3,150 doctors, 5,661 nurses, 385 community health workers, 175 pharmacists, and 57 dentists for a population of 22 million. Fifteen percent of government spending in 2008 was directed toward the health sector. Approximately 70 percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30 percent originated with international donors and other private sources. The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.

Despite these barriers to access, health services have shown a trend toward improvement over the past twenty years. Child immunizations against such diseases as <a href="hepatitis%20B">hepatitis B</a>, <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a>, and <a href="measles">measles</a> increased an average of 60 percent in this period, indicating low but increasing availability of basic medical services and treatments. The Malagasy fertility rate in 2009 was 4.6 children per woman, declining from 6.3 in 1990. Teen pregnancy rates of 14.8 percent in 2011, much higher than the African average, are a contributing factor to rapid population growth. In 2010, the maternal mortality rate was 440 per 100,000 births, compared to 373.1 in 2008 and 484.4 in 1990, indicating a decline in perinatal care following the 2009 coup. The infant mortality rate in 2011 was 41 per 1,000 births, with an under-five mortality rate at 61 per 1,000 births. <a href="Schistosomiasis">Schistosomiasis</a>, <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, and sexually transmitted diseases are common in Madagascar, although infection rates of <a href="HIV/AIDS">AIDS</a> remain low relative to many countries in mainland Africa, at 0.2 percent of the adult population. The malaria mortality rate is also among the lowest in Africa at 8.5 deaths per 100,000 people, in part because of the highest frequency use of insecticide treated nets in Africa. Adult life expectancy in 2009 was 63 years for men and 67 years for women.

In 2017, Madagascar had an <a href="2017%20Madagascar%20plague%20outbreak">outbreak</a> of the <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a> (also known as the black death) that affected urban areas.

Prior to the 19th century, all education in Madagascar was informal and typically served to teach practical skills as well as social and cultural values, including respect for ancestors and elders. The first formal European-style school was established in 1818 at <a href="Toamasina">Toamasina</a> by members of the <a href="London%20Missionary%20Society">London Missionary Society</a> (LMS). The LMS was invited by King Radama I to expand its schools throughout Imerina to teach basic literacy and numeracy to aristocratic children. The schools were closed by Ranavalona I in 1835 but reopened and expanded in the decades after her death.

By the end of the 19th century, Madagascar had the most developed and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming the focus of the curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power. Consequently, under the socialist Second Republic, French instructors and other nationals were expelled, Malagasy was declared the language of instruction, and a large cadre of young Malagasy were rapidly trained to teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.

This policy, known as "malgachization", coincided with a severe economic downturn and a dramatic decline in the quality of education. Those schooled during this period generally failed to master the French language or many other subjects and struggled to find employment, forcing many to take low-paying jobs in the informal or black market that mired them in deepening poverty. Excepting the brief presidency of Albert Zafy, from 1992 to 1996, Ratsiraka remained in power from 1975 to 2001 and failed to achieve significant improvements in education throughout his tenure.

Education was prioritized under the Ravalomanana administration (2002–09), and is currently free and compulsory from ages 6 to 13. The primary schooling cycle is five years, followed by four years at the lower secondary level and three years at the upper secondary level. During Ravalomanana's first term, thousands of new primary schools and additional classrooms were constructed, older buildings were renovated, and tens of thousands of new primary teachers were recruited and trained. Primary school fees were eliminated, and kits containing basic school supplies were distributed to primary students.

Government school construction initiatives have ensured at least one primary school per "fokontany" and one lower secondary school within each commune. At least one upper secondary school is located in each of the larger urban centers. The three branches of the national public university are located at Antananarivo, Mahajanga, and Fianarantsoa. These are complemented by public teacher-training colleges and several private universities and technical colleges.

As a result of increased educational access, enrollment rates more than doubled between 1996 and 2006. However, education quality is weak, producing high rates of grade repetition and dropout. Education policy in Ravalomanana's second term focused on quality issues, including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle school leaving certificate (BEPC) to a high school leaving certificate (BAC), and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student-centered teaching methods to boost student learning and participation in the classroom. Public expenditure on education was 13.4 percent of total government expenditure and 2.9 percent of GDP in 2008. Primary classrooms are crowded, with average pupil to teacher ratios of 47:1 in 2008.

In , the population of Madagascar was estimated at /1e6 round 0 million, up from 2.2 million in 1900. The annual population growth rate in Madagascar was approximately 2.9 percent in 2009.

Approximately 42.5 percent of the population is younger than 15 years of age, while 54.5 percent are between the ages of 15 and 64. Those aged 65 and older form 3 percent of the total population. Only two general censuses, in 1975 and 1993, have been carried out after independence. The most densely populated regions of the island are the eastern highlands and the eastern coast, contrasting most dramatically with the sparsely populated western plains.

The Malagasy ethnic group forms over 90 percent of Madagascar's population and is typically divided into 18 ethnic subgroups. Recent DNA research revealed that the genetic makeup of the average Malagasy person constitutes an approximately equal blend of <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>n and East African genes, although the genetics of some communities show a predominance of Southeast Asian or East African origins or some Arab, <a href="Indians%20in%20Madagascar">Indian</a>, or European ancestry.

Southeast Asian features – specifically from the southern part of <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> – are most predominant among the <a href="Merina%20people">Merina</a> of the central highlands, who form the largest Malagasy ethnic subgroup at approximately 26 percent of the population, while certain communities among the coastal peoples (collectively called "côtiers") have relatively stronger East African features. The largest coastal ethnic subgroups are the <a href="Betsimisaraka%20people">Betsimisaraka</a> (14.9 percent) and the <a href="Tsimihety">Tsimihety</a> and <a href="Sakalava">Sakalava</a> (6 percent each).

<a href="Chinese%20people%20in%20Madagascar">Chinese</a>, <a href="Indians%20in%20Madagascar">Indian</a> and <a href="Comoros">Comoran</a> minorities are present in Madagascar, as well as a small European (primarily <a href="French%20people">French</a>) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000 Comorans, 18,000 Indians, and 9,000 Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.

The Malagasy language is of <a href="Malayo-Polynesian">Malayo-Polynesian</a> origin and is generally spoken throughout the island. The numerous dialects of Malagasy, which are generally mutually intelligible, can be clustered under one of two subgroups: eastern Malagasy, spoken along the eastern forests and highlands including the Merina dialect of Antananarivo, and western Malagasy, spoken across the western coastal plains. French became the official language during the colonial period, when Madagascar came under the authority of France. In the first national Constitution of 1958, Malagasy and French were named the official languages of the Malagasy Republic. Madagascar is a <a href="francophone">francophone</a> country, and French is mostly spoken as a second language among the educated population and used for international communication.

No official languages were recorded in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and French were official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, on the grounds that the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.

In the Constitution of 2007, Malagasy remained the national language while official languages were reintroduced: Malagasy, French, and English. English was removed as an official language from the constitution approved by voters in the <a href="Malagasy%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%202010">November 2010 referendum</a>. The outcome of the referendum, and its consequences for official and national language policy, are not recognized by the political opposition, who cite lack of transparency and inclusiveness in the way the election was organized by the <a href="High%20Transitional%20Authority">High Transitional Authority</a>.

According to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">U.S. Department of State</a> in 2011, 41% of Madagascans practiced Christianity, and 52% adhered to traditional religions, which tends to emphasize links between the living and the "razana" (ancestors). But according to the <a href="Pew%20Research%20Center">Pew Research Center</a> in 2010, 85% of the population practiced <a href="Christianity%20in%20Madagascar">Christianity</a>, while just 4.5% of Madagascans practiced folk religions; among Christians, practitioners of <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> outnumbered adherents of <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Madagascar">Roman Catholicism</a>.

The <a href="Veneration%20of%20the%20dead">veneration of ancestors</a> has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the "<a href="famadihana">famadihana</a>", whereby a deceased family member's remains are exhumed and re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds, before being replaced in the tomb. The "famadihana" is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served, and a "<a href="hiragasy">hiragasy</a>" troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present. Consideration for ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to "<a href="Fady%20%28taboo%29">fady</a>", taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of <a href="zebu">zebu</a> is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. In addition, the Malagasy traditionally believe in a creator god, called <a href="Zanahary">Zanahary</a> or Andriamanitra.

Today, many Christians integrate their religious beliefs with traditional ones related to honoring the ancestors. For instance, they may bless their dead at church before proceeding with traditional burial rites or invite a <a href="minister%20%28Christianity%29">Christian minister</a> to consecrate a "famadihana" reburial. The Malagasy Council of Churches comprises the four oldest and most prominent Christian denominations of Madagascar (Roman Catholic, <a href="Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20in%20Madagascar">Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar</a>, <a href="Malagasy%20Lutheran%20Church">Lutheran</a>, and <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>) and has been an influential force in Malagasy politics.

<a href="Islam">Islam</a> is also practiced on the island. Islam was first brought to Madagascar in the Middle Ages by <a href="Arab%20people">Arab</a> and <a href="Somali%20people">Somali</a> Muslim traders, who established several Islamic schools along the eastern coast. While the use of Arabic script and loan words and the adoption of Islamic astrology would spread across the island, the Islamic religion took hold in only a handful of southeastern coastal communities. Today, <a href="Islam%20in%20Madagascar">Muslims</a> constitute 3–7 percent of the population of Madagascar and are largely concentrated in the northwestern provinces of <a href="Mahajanga">Mahajanga</a> and <a href="Antsiranana">Antsiranana</a>. The vast majority of Muslims are <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a>. Muslims are divided between those of Malagasy ethnicity, Indians, Pakistanis and Comorans. 

More recently, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> was introduced to Madagascar through <a href="Gujarati%20people">Gujarati people</a> immigrating from the <a href="Saurashtra%20%28region%29">Saurashtra</a> region of <a href="India">India</a> in the late 19th century. Most Hindus in Madagascar speak <a href="Gujarati%20language">Gujarati</a> or <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> at home.

Each of the many ethnic subgroups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, practices and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, there are a number of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize "fihavanana" (solidarity), "vintana" (destiny), "tody" (karma), and "<a href="Hasina%20%28Madagascar%29">hasina</a>", a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.

Although social castes are no longer legally recognized, ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status, economic opportunity, and roles within the community. Malagasy people traditionally consult "Mpanandro" ("Makers of the Days") to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or "famadihana", according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs. Similarly, the nobles of many Malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the "ombiasy" (from "olona-be-hasina", "man of much virtue") of the southeastern <a href="Antemoro%20people">Antemoro</a> ethnic group, who trace their ancestry back to early Arab settlers.

The diverse origins of Malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the "<a href="valiha">valiha</a>", is a <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> tube <a href="zither">zither</a> carried to Madagascar by early settlers from <a href="South%20Kalimantan">southern Borneo</a>, and is very similar in form to those found in <a href="Music%20of%20Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and the <a href="Music%20of%20the%20Philippines">Philippines</a> today. Traditional <a href="Architecture%20of%20Madagascar">houses in Madagascar</a> are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar. Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living. The production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven "<a href="lamba%20%28garment%29">lamba</a>", has evolved into a varied and refined art.

The Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in <a href="Malagasy%20cuisine">Malagasy cuisine</a>, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes. African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. <a href="Cattle%20raiding">Cattle rustling</a>, originally a rite of passage for young men in the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.

A wide variety of oral and written <a href="Literature%20of%20Madagascar">literature</a> has developed in Madagascar. One of the island's foremost artistic traditions is its oratory, as expressed in the forms of "<a href="hainteny">hainteny</a>" (poetry), "kabary" (public discourse) and "ohabolana" (proverbs). An epic poem exemplifying these traditions, the "<a href="Ibonia">Ibonia</a>", has been handed down over the centuries in several different forms across the island, and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities. This tradition was continued in the 20th century by such artists as <a href="Jean-Joseph%20Rabearivelo">Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo</a>, who is considered Africa's first modern poet, and <a href="Elie%20Rajaonarison">Elie Rajaonarison</a>, an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry. Madagascar has also developed a rich <a href="Music%20of%20Madagascar">musical heritage</a>, embodied in dozens of regional musical genres such as the coastal "<a href="salegy">salegy</a>" or highland "<a href="hiragasy">hiragasy</a>" that enliven village gatherings, local dance floors and national airwaves. Madagascar also has a growing culture of classical music fostered through youth academies, organizations and orchestras that promote youth involvement in classical music.

The plastic arts are also widespread throughout the island. In addition to the tradition of silk weaving and lamba production, the weaving of <a href="Raffia%20palm">raffia</a> and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats. Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, "aloalo" funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market. The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the <a href="Zafimaniry">Zafimaniry</a> people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's <a href="UNESCO%20Intangible%20Cultural%20Heritage%20Lists">list of Intangible Cultural Heritage</a> in 2008.

Among the Antaimoro people, the production of paper embedded with flowers and other decorative natural materials is a long-established tradition that the community has begun to market to eco-tourists. Embroidery and <a href="drawn%20thread%20work">drawn thread work</a> are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets. A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development of fine arts in Madagascar.

A number of traditional pastimes have emerged in Madagascar. "<a href="Moraingy">Moraingy</a>", a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate. The wrestling of <a href="zebu">zebu</a> cattle, which is named savika or "tolon-omby", is also practiced in many regions. In addition to sports, a wide variety of games are played. Among the most emblematic is "<a href="fanorona">fanorona</a>", a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King <a href="Andrianjaka">Andrianjaka</a> after his father <a href="Ralambo">Ralambo</a> was partially the result of the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing "fanorona" to the detriment of his other responsibilities.

Western recreational activities were introduced to Madagascar over the past two centuries. <a href="Rugby%20union%20in%20Madagascar">Rugby union</a> is considered the national sport of Madagascar. <a href="Football%20in%20Madagascar">Soccer</a> is also popular. Madagascar has produced a world champion in <a href="p%C3%A9tanque">pétanque</a>, a French game similar to <a href="lawn%20bowling">lawn bowling</a>, which is widely played in urban areas and throughout the Highlands. School athletics programs typically include soccer, track and field, judo, boxing, women's basketball and women's tennis. Madagascar sent its first competitors to the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">Olympic Games</a> in 1964, and has also competed in the <a href="African%20Games">African Games</a>. <a href="Scouting">Scouting</a> is represented in Madagascar by its <a href="Firaisan%27ny%20Skotisma%20eto%20Madagasikara">own local federation</a> of three scouting clubs. Membership in 2011 was estimated at 14,905.

Because of its advanced sports facilities, Antananarivo gained the hosting rights for several of Africa's top international basketball events, including the <a href="2011%20FIBA%20Africa%20Championship">2011 FIBA Africa Championship</a>, the <a href="2009%20FIBA%20Africa%20Championship%20for%20Women">2009 FIBA Africa Championship for Women</a>, the <a href="2014%20FIBA%20Africa%20Under-18%20Championship">2014 FIBA Africa Under-18 Championship</a>, the <a href="2013%20FIBA%20Africa%20Under-16%20Championship">2013 FIBA Africa Under-16 Championship</a>, and the <a href="2015%20FIBA%20Africa%20Under-16%20Championship%20for%20Women">2015 FIBA Africa Under-16 Championship for Women</a>.

Malagasy cuisine reflects the diverse influences of <a href="List%20of%20Asian%20cuisines">Southeast Asian</a>, <a href="African%20cuisine">African</a>, <a href="Indian%20cuisine">Indian</a>, <a href="Chinese%20cuisine">Chinese</a> and <a href="European%20cuisine">European</a> culinary traditions. The complexity of Malagasy meals can range from the simple, traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers, to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island's 19th-century monarchs. Throughout almost the entire island, the contemporary cuisine of Madagascar typically consists of a base of rice ("vary") served with an accompaniment ("laoka"). The many varieties of "laoka" may be <a href="vegetarian%20cuisine">vegetarian</a> or include animal proteins, and typically feature a sauce flavored with such ingredients as ginger, onion, garlic, tomato, vanilla, coconut milk, salt, curry powder, green peppercorns or, less commonly, other spices or herbs. In parts of the arid south and west, pastoral families may replace rice with maize, <a href="cassava">cassava</a>, or <a href="curd">curd</a>s made from fermented zebu milk. A wide variety of sweet and savory <a href="fritter">fritter</a>s as well as other street foods are available across the island, as are diverse tropical and temperate-climate fruits. Locally produced beverages include fruit juices, coffee, herbal teas and teas, and alcoholic drinks such as <a href="rum">rum</a>, wine, and beer. <a href="Three%20Horses%20Beer">Three Horses Beer</a> is the most popular beer on the island and is considered emblematic of Madagascar. The island also produces some of the world's finest chocolate; <a href="Chocolaterie%20Robert">Chocolaterie Robert</a>, established in 1940, is the most famous chocolate company on the island.

Marilyn Monroe

Marilyn Monroe (born Norma Jeane Mortenson; June 1, 1926 – August 5, 1962) was an American actress, model, and singer. Famous for playing comic "<a href="Bombshell%20%28sex%20symbol%29">blonde bombshell</a>" characters, she became one of the most popular <a href="sex%20symbol">sex symbol</a>s of the 1950s and was emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. Although she was a <a href="billing%20%28filmmaking%29">top-billed</a> actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million by the time of <a href="Death%20of%20Marilyn%20Monroe">her unexpected death</a> in 1962 (equivalent to $ billion in ). More than half a century later, she continues to be a major <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a> icon. 

Born and raised in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, Monroe spent most of her childhood in <a href="Foster%20care%20in%20the%20United%20States">foster homes</a> and an orphanage and married at the age of 16. While working in a <a href="Radioplane%20Company">radioplane factory</a> in 1944 as part of the <a href="United%20States%20home%20front%20during%20World%20War%20II">war effort</a>, she was introduced to a photographer from the <a href="First%20Motion%20Picture%20Unit">First Motion Picture Unit</a> and began a successful <a href="pin-up%20model">pin-up model</a>ing career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">Twentieth Century-Fox</a> (1946–1947) and <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress and had roles in several comedies, including "<a href="As%20Young%20as%20You%20Feel">As Young as You Feel</a>" and "<a href="Monkey%20Business%20%281952%20film%29">Monkey Business</a>", and in the dramas "<a href="Clash%20by%20Night">Clash by Night</a>" and "<a href="Don%27t%20Bother%20to%20Knock">Don't Bother to Knock</a>". Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before she became a star, but the story did not tarnish her career and instead resulted in increased interest in her films. 

By 1953, Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars; she had leading roles in the <a href="film%20noir">noir film</a> "<a href="Niagara%20%28film%29">Niagara</a>", which focused on her sex appeal, and the comedies "<a href="Gentlemen%20Prefer%20Blondes%20%281953%20film%29">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</a>" and "<a href="How%20to%20Marry%20a%20Millionaire">How to Marry a Millionaire</a>", which established her star image as a "<a href="Blonde%20stereotype">dumb blonde</a>". The same year, her images were used as the <a href="centerfold">centerfold</a> and in the cover of the first issue of the <a href="List%20of%20men%27s%20magazines">men's magazine</a> "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>". Although she played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, she was disappointed when she was <a href="typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project but returned to star in one of the biggest box office successes of her career, "<a href="The%20Seven%20Year%20Itch">The Seven Year Itch</a>" (1955).

When the studio was still reluctant to change Monroe's contract, she founded a film <a href="production%20company">production company</a> in late 1954; she named it Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying <a href="method%20acting">method acting</a> at the <a href="Actors%20Studio">Actors Studio</a>. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. Her subsequent roles included a critically acclaimed performance in "<a href="Bus%20Stop%20%281956%20film%29">Bus Stop</a>" (1956) and the first independent production of MMP, "<a href="The%20Prince%20and%20the%20Showgirl">The Prince and the Showgirl</a>" (1957). Monroe won a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Golden Globe for Best Actress</a> for her work in "<a href="Some%20Like%20It%20Hot">Some Like It Hot</a>" (1959), a critical and commercial success. Her last completed film was the drama "<a href="The%20Misfits%20%28film%29">The Misfits</a>" (1961).

Monroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with <a href="substance%20abuse">substance abuse</a>, <a href="depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a>, and <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a>. Her second and third marriages, to retired baseball star <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a> and playwright <a href="Arthur%20Miller">Arthur Miller</a>, respectively, were highly publicised and both ended in divorce. On August 5, 1962, she <a href="Death%20of%20Marilyn%20Monroe">died</a> at age 36 from an overdose of <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s at her home in Los Angeles. Although Monroe's death was ruled a probable suicide, several <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theories</a> have been proposed in the decades following her death.

Monroe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson at the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%20Hospital">Los Angeles County Hospital</a> on June 1, 1926 as the third child of Gladys Pearl Baker (née Monroe, 1902–1984). Gladys was the daughter of two poor <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwesterners</a> who migrated to California. At the age of 15, she married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917–1933) and Berniece (b. 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was 12, and met her for the first time as an adult. Following the divorce, Gladys worked as a film negative cutter at <a href="Consolidated%20Film%20Industries">Consolidated Film Industries</a>. In 1924, she married her second husband, Martin Edward Mortensen, but they separated only some months later and divorced in 1928. The identity of Monroe's father is unknown and she most often used Baker as her surname.

Although Gladys was mentally and financially unprepared for a child, Monroe's early childhood was stable and happy. Soon after the birth, Gladys was able to place her daughter with foster parents Albert and Ida Bolender in the rural town of <a href="Hawthorne%2C%20California">Hawthorne</a>. They raised their foster children according to the principles of <a href="evangelicalism">evangelical Christianity</a>. At first, Gladys lived with the Bolenders and commuted to work in Los Angeles, until longer work shifts forced her to move back to the city in early 1927. She then began visiting her daughter on weekends, often taking her to the cinema and to sightsee in Los Angeles. Although the Bolenders wanted to adopt Monroe, by the summer of 1933 Gladys felt stable enough for Monroe to move in with her and bought a small house in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. They shared it with lodgers, actors George and Maude Atkinson and their daughter, Nellie. Some months later, in January 1934, Gladys had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed with <a href="paranoid%20schizophrenia">paranoid schizophrenia</a>. After several months in a rest home, she was committed to the <a href="Metropolitan%20State%20Hospital%20%28California%29">Metropolitan State Hospital</a>. She spent the rest of her life in and out of hospitals and was rarely in contact with Monroe.
Monroe became a <a href="ward%20%28law%29">ward of the state</a>, and her mother's friend, Grace McKee Goddard, took responsibility over her and her mother's affairs. In the following four years, she lived with several foster families and often switched schools. For the first 16 months, she continued living with the Atkinsons; she was sexually abused during this time. Always a shy girl, she now also developed a <a href="stutter">stutter</a> and became withdrawn. In the summer of 1935, she briefly stayed with Grace and her husband Erwin "Doc" Goddard and two other families, until Grace placed her in the Los Angeles Orphans Home in Hollywood in September 1935. While the orphanage was "a model institution" and was described in positive terms by her peers, Monroe found being placed there traumatizing, as to her "it seemed that no one wanted me".

Encouraged by the orphanage staff who thought that Monroe would be happier living in a family, Grace became her <a href="legal%20guardian">legal guardian</a> in 1936, although she was not able to take her out of the orphanage until the summer of 1937. Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months because Doc molested her. After staying with several of her relatives and Grace's friends and relatives in Los Angeles and <a href="Compton%2C%20California">Compton</a>, Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt, Ana Atchinson Lower, in the <a href="Sawtelle%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Sawtelle</a> district. She was enrolled in <a href="Emerson%20Junior%20High%20School">Emerson Junior High School</a> and was taken to weekly <a href="Christian%20Science">Christian Science</a> services with Lower. Monroe was otherwise a mediocre student, but she excelled in writing and contributed to the school newspaper. Due to the elderly Lower's health issues, Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in <a href="Van%20Nuys%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Van Nuys</a> in either late 1940 or early 1941. After graduating from Emerson, she began attending <a href="Van%20Nuys%20High%20School">Van Nuys High School</a>.

In early 1942, the company that employed Doc Goddard relocated him to <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>. California child protection laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state, and she faced the possibility of having to return to the orphanage. As a solution, she married their neighbors' son, 21-year-old factory worker James "Jim" Dougherty on June 19, 1942, just after her 16th birthday. Monroe subsequently dropped out of high school and became a housewife; she later stated that the "marriage didn't make me sad, but it didn't make me happy, either. My husband and I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn't because we were angry. We had nothing to say. I was dying of boredom." In 1943, Dougherty enlisted in the <a href="United%20States%20Merchant%20Marine">Merchant Marine</a> and was stationed on <a href="Santa%20Catalina%20Island%2C%20California">Santa Catalina Island</a>, where Monroe moved with him.

In April 1944, Jim Dougherty was shipped out to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20theater%20of%20World%20War%20II">Pacific</a>; he would remain there for most of the next two years. Monroe moved in with his parents and began a job at the <a href="Radioplane%20Company">Radioplane Munitions Factory</a> in Van Nuys. In late 1944, she met photographer <a href="David%20Conover">David Conover</a>, who had been sent by the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Air%20Forces">U.S. Army Air Forces</a>' <a href="First%20Motion%20Picture%20Unit">First Motion Picture Unit</a> to the factory to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers. Although none of her pictures were used, she quit working at the factory in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends. Defying her deployed husband, she moved on her own and signed a contract with the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945.

As a model, Monroe occasionally used the name Jean Norman. She straightened her curly brunette hair and dyed it blonde to make herself more employable. Her figure was deemed more suitable for <a href="pin-up">pin-up</a> than fashion modeling, and she was featured mostly in advertisements and men's magazines. According to the agency's owner, Emmeline Snively, Monroe was one of its most ambitious and hard-working models; by early 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers for publications such as "<a href="Pageant%20%28magazine%29">Pageant</a>", "U.S. Camera", "Laff", and "Peek".

Through Snively, Monroe signed a contract with an acting agency in June 1946. After an unsuccessful interview at <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>, she was given a screen-test by <a href="Ben%20Lyon">Ben Lyon</a>, a <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century-Fox</a> executive. Head executive <a href="Darryl%20F.%20Zanuck">Darryl F. Zanuck</a> was unenthusiastic about it, but he was persuaded to give her a standard six-month contract to avoid her being signed by rival studio <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Pictures</a>. Monroe's contract began in August 1946, and she and Lyon selected the <a href="stage%20name">stage name</a> "Marilyn Monroe". The first name was picked by Lyon, who was reminded of Broadway star <a href="Marilyn%20Miller">Marilyn Miller</a>; the last was picked by Monroe after her mother's maiden name. In September 1946, she divorced Dougherty, who was against her having a career.
Monroe had no film roles during the first months of her contract and instead dedicated her days to acting, singing and dancing classes. Eager to learn more about the film industry and in order to promote herself, she spent time at the studio lot to observe others working. Her contract was renewed in February 1947, and she was given her first two film roles, bit parts in "<a href="Dangerous%20Years">Dangerous Years</a>" (1947) and "<a href="Scudda%20Hoo%21%20Scudda%20Hay%21">Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!</a>" (1948). The studio also enrolled her in the <a href="Actors%27%20Laboratory%20Theatre">Actors' Laboratory Theatre</a>, an acting school teaching the techniques of the <a href="Group%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%29">Group Theatre</a>; she later stated that it was "my first taste of what real acting in a real drama could be, and I was hooked". Despite her enthusiasm, her teachers thought her too shy and insecure to have a future as an actor, and Fox did not renew Monroe's contract in August 1947. She returned to modeling while also doing occasional odd jobs at film studios, such as working as a dancing "pacer" behind the scenes at musical sets.

Monroe was determined to make it as an actress, and she continued studying at the Actors' Lab, paying for the classes herself. In October 1947, she appeared as a blonde <a href="Femme%20fatale">vamp</a> in the play "Glamour Preferred" at the <a href="Bliss-Hayden%20Theater">Bliss-Hayden Theater</a>, but the production was not reviewed by any major publication and ended after only a few performances. To promote herself, she frequented producers' offices, befriended gossip columnist <a href="Sidney%20Skolsky">Sidney Skolsky</a>, and entertained influential male guests at studio functions, a practice she had begun at Fox. She also became a friend and occasional sex partner of Fox executive <a href="Joseph%20M.%20Schenck">Joseph M. Schenck</a>, who persuaded his friend <a href="Harry%20Cohn">Harry Cohn</a>, the head executive of Columbia Pictures, to sign her in March 1948.

While at Fox, Monroe was given roles of a "girl next door"; at Columbia, she was modeled after <a href="Rita%20Hayworth">Rita Hayworth</a>. Her hairline was raised and her hair was bleached to platinum blonde. She also began working with the studio's head drama coach, <a href="Natasha%20Lytess">Natasha Lytess</a>, who would remain her mentor until 1955. Her only film at the studio was the low-budget musical "<a href="Ladies%20of%20the%20Chorus">Ladies of the Chorus</a>" (1948), in which she had her first starring role as a chorus girl who is courted by a wealthy man. She also screentested for the lead role in "<a href="Born%20Yesterday%20%281950%20film%29">Born Yesterday</a>" (1950), but her contract was not renewed in September 1948. "Ladies of the Chorus" was released the following month and was not a success.

After Columbia, Monroe became the protégée of <a href="Johnny%20Hyde">Johnny Hyde</a>, who was the vice president of the <a href="William%20Morris%20Agency">William Morris Agency</a>. Hyde represented her and their relationship soon became sexual, with him even proposing marriage. He paid for a silicone prosthesis to be implanted in Monroe's jaw and possibly for a <a href="rhinoplasty">rhinoplasty</a>, and arranged a bit part in the <a href="Marx%20Brothers">Marx Brothers</a> film "<a href="Love%20Happy">Love Happy</a>" (1950). Monroe also continued modeling, and in May 1949 she posed nude for photos taken by <a href="Tom%20Kelley%20%28photographer%29">Tom Kelley</a>. Although her role in "Love Happy" was very small, she was chosen to participate in the film's promotional tour in New York that year.

In 1950, Monroe had bit parts in "Love Happy", "<a href="A%20Ticket%20to%20Tomahawk">A Ticket to Tomahawk</a>", "<a href="Right%20Cross">Right Cross</a>" and "<a href="The%20Fireball">The Fireball</a>", but also appeared in minor supporting roles in two critically acclaimed films: <a href="Joseph%20Mankiewicz">Joseph Mankiewicz</a>'s drama "<a href="All%20About%20Eve">All About Eve</a>" and <a href="John%20Huston">John Huston</a>'s <a href="crime%20film">crime film</a> "<a href="The%20Asphalt%20Jungle">The Asphalt Jungle</a>". Despite only appearing on screen for a few minutes in the latter, she gained a mention in "<a href="Photoplay">Photoplay</a>" and according to Spoto "moved effectively from movie model to serious actress". In December 1950, Hyde was able to negotiate a seven-year contract for Monroe with 20th Century-Fox. He died of a heart attack only days later, which left her devastated.

The Fox contract gave Monroe more publicity. In March 1951, she was a presenter at the <a href="23rd%20Academy%20Awards">23rd Academy Awards</a>, and in September, "<a href="Collier%27s">Collier's</a>" became the first national magazine to publish a full-length profile of her. The same year, she had supporting roles in four low-budget films: in the <a href="MGM">MGM</a> drama "<a href="Home%20Town%20Story">Home Town Story</a>", and in three moderately successful comedies for Fox, "<a href="As%20Young%20as%20You%20Feel">As Young as You Feel</a>", "<a href="Love%20Nest">Love Nest</a>", and "<a href="Let%27s%20Make%20It%20Legal">Let's Make It Legal</a>". According to Spoto all four films featured her "essentially [as] a sexy ornament", but she received some praise from critics: <a href="Bosley%20Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described her as "superb" in "As Young As You Feel" and Ezra Goodman of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Daily%20News%20%28historic%29">Los Angeles Daily News</a>" called her "one of the brightest up-and-coming [actresses]" for "Love Nest". To further develop her acting skills, Monroe began taking classes with <a href="Michael%20Chekhov">Michael Chekhov</a> and mime Lotte Goslar. Her popularity with audiences was also growing: she received several thousand letters of fan mail a week, and was declared "Miss <a href="pin-up">Cheesecake</a> of 1951" by the army newspaper "<a href="Stars%20and%20Stripes%20%28newspaper%29">Stars and Stripes</a>", reflecting the preferences of soldiers in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. In her private life, Monroe was in a relationship with director <a href="Elia%20Kazan">Elia Kazan</a>, and also briefly dated several other men, including director <a href="Nicholas%20Ray">Nicholas Ray</a> and actors <a href="Yul%20Brynner">Yul Brynner</a> and <a href="Peter%20Lawford">Peter Lawford</a>.
In the second year of her contract, Monroe became a <a href="Billing%20%28filmmaking%29">top-billed</a> actress. Gossip columnist <a href="Florabel%20Muir">Florabel Muir</a> named her the "<a href="it%20girl">it girl</a>" of 1952 and <a href="Hedda%20Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a> described her as the "cheesecake queen" turned "box office smash". In February, she was named the "best young box office personality" by the <a href="Hollywood%20Foreign%20Press%20Association">Foreign Press Association of Hollywood</a>, and began a highly publicized romance with retired <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankee</a> <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a>, who was one of the most famous sports personalities of the era.

In March 1952, a scandal broke when Monroe revealed during an interview that in 1949, she had posed for nude pictures, which were now featured in calendars. The studio had learned of the upcoming publication of the calendar some weeks prior, and together with Monroe decided that to avoid damaging her career it was best to admit to them while stressing that she had been broke at the time. The strategy gained her public sympathy and increased interest in her films; the following month, she was featured on the cover of "Life" as "The Talk of Hollywood". Monroe added to her reputation as a new sex symbol with other publicity stunts that year: she wore a revealing dress when acting as Grand Marshal at the <a href="Miss%20America%20Pageant">Miss America Pageant</a> parade, and told gossip columnist <a href="Earl%20Wilson%20%28columnist%29">Earl Wilson</a> that she usually wore no underwear.
Regardless of her popularity and sex appeal, Monroe wished to present more of her acting range. She appeared in two commercially successful dramas in the summer of 1952. The first was <a href="Fritz%20Lang">Fritz Lang</a>'s "<a href="Clash%20by%20Night">Clash by Night</a>", for which she was loaned to RKO and played a fish cannery worker; to prepare, she spent time in a real fish cannery in <a href="Monterey">Monterey</a>. She received positive reviews for her performance: "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" stated that "she deserves starring status with her excellent interpretation", and "Variety" wrote that she "has an ease of delivery which makes her a cinch for popularity". The second film was the thriller "<a href="Don%27t%20Bother%20to%20Knock">Don't Bother to Knock</a>", in which she starred as a mentally disturbed babysitter and which Zanuck had assigned for her to test her abilities in a heavier dramatic role. It received mixed reviews from critics, with Crowther deeming her too inexperienced for the difficult role, and "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" blaming the script for the film's problems.

Monroe's three other films in 1952 continued her typecasting in comic roles that focused on her sex appeal. In "<a href="We%27re%20Not%20Married%21">We're Not Married!</a>", her starring role as a beauty pageant contestant was created solely to "present Marilyn in two bathing suits", according to its writer <a href="Nunnally%20Johnson">Nunnally Johnson</a>. In <a href="Howard%20Hawks">Howard Hawks</a>' "<a href="Monkey%20Business%20%281952%20film%29">Monkey Business</a>", in which she was featured opposite <a href="Cary%20Grant">Cary Grant</a>, she played a secretary who is a "dumb, childish blonde, innocently unaware of the havoc her sexiness causes around her". In "<a href="O.%20Henry%27s%20Full%20House">O. Henry's Full House</a>", her final film of the year, she had a minor role as a prostitute.

During this period, Monroe gained a reputation for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later <a href="Paula%20Strasberg">Paula Strasberg</a>—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and <a href="stage%20fright">stage fright</a>; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>, she began to use <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s, <a href="amphetamines">amphetamines</a> and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to <a href="Sarah%20Churchwell">Sarah Churchwell</a>, some of Monroe's behavior—especially later in her career—was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.

Monroe starred in three movies that were released in 1953 and emerged as a major sex symbol and one of Hollywood's most bankable performers. The first of these was the <a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> "<a href="Niagara%20%281953%20film%29">Niagara</a>", in which she played a "femme fatale" scheming to murder her husband, played by <a href="Joseph%20Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>. By then, Monroe and her make-up artist <a href="Allan%20%26quot%3BWhitey%26quot%3B%20Snyder">Allan "Whitey" Snyder</a> had developed the make-up look that became associated with her: dark arched brows, pale skin, "glistening" red lips and a beauty mark. According to Sarah Churchwell, "Niagara" was one of the most overtly sexual films of Monroe's career, and it included scenes in which her body was covered only by a sheet or a towel, considered shocking by contemporary audiences. Its most famous scene is a 30-second <a href="long%20shot">long shot</a> behind Monroe where she is seen walking with her hips swaying, which was heavily used in the film's marketing.

When "Niagara" was released in January, <a href="women%27s%20club%20%28United%20States%29">women's clubs</a> protested that the film was immoral, but the movie proved popular with audiences and grossed $6 million at the box office. While "Variety" deemed it "clichéd" and "morbid", "The New York Times" commented that "the falls and Miss Monroe are something to see", as although Monroe may not be "the perfect actress at this point ... she can be seductive – even when she walks".
Monroe continued to attract attention by wearing revealing outfits in publicity events, most famously at the "Photoplay" awards in January 1953, where she won the "Fastest Rising Star" award. She wore a skin-tight gold <a href="Lam%C3%A9%20%28fabric%29">lamé</a> dress, which prompted veteran star <a href="Joan%20Crawford">Joan Crawford</a> to describe her behavior as "unbecoming an actress and a lady" to the press.

While "Niagara" made Monroe a sex symbol and established her "look", her second film of the year, the satirical musical comedy "<a href="Gentlemen%20Prefer%20Blondes%20%281953%20film%29">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</a>", established her screen persona as a "dumb blonde". Based on <a href="Anita%20Loos">Anita Loos</a>' <a href="Gentlemen%20Prefer%20Blondes%20%28novel%29">bestselling novel</a> and <a href="Gentlemen%20Prefer%20Blondes%20%28musical%29">its Broadway version</a>, the film focuses on two "gold-digging" <a href="showgirl">showgirl</a>s, Lorelei Lee and Dorothy Shaw, played by Monroe and <a href="Jane%20Russell">Jane Russell</a>. The role of Lorelei was originally intended for <a href="Betty%20Grable">Betty Grable</a>, who had been 20th Century-Fox's most popular "<a href="blonde%20bombshell%20%28stereotype%29">blonde bombshell</a>" in the 1940s; Monroe was fast eclipsing her as a star who could appeal to both male and female audiences. As part of the film's publicity campaign, she and Russell pressed their hand and footprints in wet concrete outside <a href="Grauman%27s%20Chinese%20Theatre">Grauman's Chinese Theatre</a> in June. "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" was released shortly after and became one of the biggest box office successes of the year by grossing $5.3 million, more than double its production costs. Crowther of "The New York Times" and William Brogdon of "Variety" both commented favorably on Monroe, especially noting her performance of "<a href="Diamonds%20Are%20a%20Girl%27s%20Best%20Friend">Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend</a>"; according to the latter, she demonstrated the "ability to sex a song as well as point up the eye values of a scene by her presence".

In September, Monroe made her television debut in the "<a href="Jack%20Benny%20Show">Jack Benny Show</a>" playing Jack's fantasy woman in the episode "Honolulu Trip". She co-starred with Betty Grable and <a href="Lauren%20Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a> in her third movie of the year, "<a href="How%20to%20Marry%20a%20Millionaire">How to Marry a Millionaire</a>", released in November. It featured Monroe in the role of a naïve model who teams up with her friends to find rich husbands, repeating the successful formula of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes". It was the second film ever released in <a href="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a>, a widescreen format that Fox hoped would draw audiences back to theaters as television was beginning to cause losses to film studios. Despite mixed reviews, the film was Monroe's biggest box office success at that point in her career, earning $8 million in world rentals.

Monroe was listed in the annual <a href="Top%20Ten%20Money%20Making%20Stars%20Poll">Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll</a> in both 1953 and 1954, and according to Fox historian Aubrey Solomon became the studio's "greatest asset" alongside CinemaScope. Monroe's position as a leading sex symbol was confirmed in December 1953, when <a href="Hugh%20Hefner">Hugh Hefner</a> featured her on the cover and as centerfold in the first issue of "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>". The cover image was a photograph taken of her at the Miss America Pageant parade in 1952, and the centerfold featured one of her 1949 nude photographs.

Although Monroe had become one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her contract had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version of "<a href="The%20Girl%20in%20Pink%20Tights">The Girl in Pink Tights</a>", which was to co-star <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.

The suspension was front-page news, and Monroe immediately began a publicity campaign to counter any negative press and to strengthen her position in the conflict. On January 14, she and Joe DiMaggio, whose relationship had been subject to constant media attention since 1952, were married at <a href="San%20Francisco%20City%20Hall">San Francisco City Hall</a>. They then traveled to Japan, combining a honeymoon with his business trip. From there, she traveled alone to Korea, where she performed songs from her films as part of a <a href="United%20Service%20Organizations">USO</a> show for over 60,000 U.S. Marines over a four-day period. After returning to Hollywood in February, she was awarded "Photoplay"s "Most Popular Female Star" prize. She reached a settlement with the studio in March: it included a new contract to be made later in the year, and a starring role in the film version of the Broadway play "<a href="The%20Seven%20Year%20Itch%20%28play%29">The Seven Year Itch</a>", for which she was to receive a bonus of $100,000.

Monroe's next film was <a href="Otto%20Preminger">Otto Preminger</a>'s <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Western</a> "<a href="River%20of%20No%20Return">River of No Return</a>", which had been filmed prior to her suspension and featured <a href="Robert%20Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a> as her co-star. She called it a "Z-grade cowboy movie in which the acting finished second to the scenery and the CinemaScope process", although it was popular with audiences. The first film she made after returning to Fox was the musical "<a href="There%27s%20No%20Business%20Like%20Show%20Business%20%28film%29">There's No Business Like Show Business</a>", which she strongly disliked but the studio required her to do in exchange for dropping "The Girl in Pink Tights". The musical was unsuccessful upon its release in December, and Monroe's performance was considered vulgar by many critics.
In September 1954, Monroe began filming <a href="Billy%20Wilder">Billy Wilder</a>'s comedy "<a href="The%20Seven%20Year%20Itch">The Seven Year Itch</a>", in which she starred opposite <a href="Tom%20Ewell">Tom Ewell</a> as a woman who becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene on <a href="Lexington%20Avenue">Lexington Avenue</a> in Manhattan. In the shoot, Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the air blowing up the skirt of her <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe%27s%20white%20dress">white dress</a>, which became one of the most famous scenes of her career. The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including professional photographers.

The publicity stunt placed Monroe on international front pages, and it also marked the end of her marriage to DiMaggio, who was furious about the stunt. The union had been troubled from the start by his jealousy and controlling attitude; Spoto and Banner have also asserted that he was physically abusive. After Monroe returned to Hollywood, she hired high-profile attorney <a href="Jerry%20Giesler">Jerry Giesler</a> and announced in October 1954 that she was filing for divorce from DiMaggio after only nine months of marriage. "The Seven Year Itch" was released the following June and grossed over $4.5 million at the box office, making it one of the biggest commercial successes that year.

After filming for "The Seven Year Itch" wrapped in November, Monroe began a new battle for control over her career and left Hollywood for the East Coast, where she and photographer <a href="Milton%20Greene">Milton Greene</a> founded their own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP) – an action that has later been called "instrumental" in the collapse of the <a href="studio%20system">studio system</a>. Announcing its foundation in a press conference in January 1955, Monroe stated that she was "tired of the same old sex roles. I want to do better things. People have scope, you know." She asserted that she was no longer under contract to Fox, as the studio had not fulfilled its duties, such as paying her the promised bonus for "The Seven Year Itch". This began a year-long legal battle between her and the studio. The press largely ridiculed Monroe for her actions and she was parodied in "The Seven Year Itch" writer <a href="George%20Axelrod">George Axelrod</a>'s "<a href="Will%20Success%20Spoil%20Rock%20Hunter%3F%20%28play%29">Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?</a>" (1955), in which her lookalike <a href="Jayne%20Mansfield">Jayne Mansfield</a> played a dumb actress who starts her own production company.
Monroe dedicated 1955 to studying her craft. She moved to Manhattan and took acting classes with <a href="Constance%20Collier">Constance Collier</a> and attended workshops on <a href="method%20acting">method acting</a> at the <a href="Actors%20Studio">Actors Studio</a>, run by <a href="Lee%20Strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a>. She grew close to Strasberg and his wife Paula, receiving private lessons at their home due to her shyness, and soon became a family member. She dismissed her old drama coach, <a href="Natasha%20Lytess">Natasha Lytess</a>, and replaced her with Paula; the Strasbergs remained an important influence for the rest of her career. Monroe also started undergoing <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a> at the recommendation of Strasberg, who believed that an actor must confront their emotional traumas and use them in their performances.

In her private life, Monroe continued her relationship with DiMaggio despite the ongoing divorce proceedings; she also dated actor <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a> and playwright <a href="Arthur%20Miller">Arthur Miller</a>. She had first been introduced to Miller by Kazan in the early 1950s. The affair between Monroe and Miller became increasingly serious after October 1955, when her divorce from DiMaggio was finalized and Miller separated from his wife. The FBI also opened a file on her. The studio feared that Monroe would be blacklisted and urged her to end the affair, as Miller was being investigated by the <a href="FBI">FBI</a> for allegations of <a href="communism">communism</a> and had been subpoenaed by the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>. Despite the risk to her career, Monroe refused to end the relationship, later calling the studio heads "born cowards".

By the end of the year, Monroe and Fox had come to an agreement about a new seven-year contract. It was clear that MMP would not be able to finance films alone, and the studio was eager to have Monroe working again. The contract required her to make four movies for Fox during the seven years. The studio would pay her $100,000 for each movie, and granted her the right to choose her own projects, directors and cinematographers. She would also be free to make one film with MMP per each completed film for Fox.

Monroe began 1956 by announcing her win over 20th Century-Fox; the press, which had previously derided her, now wrote favorably about her decision to fight the studio. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" called her a "shrewd businesswoman" and "<a href="Look%20%28American%20magazine%29">Look</a>" predicted that the win would be "an example of the individual against the herd for years to come". In March, she officially changed her name to Marilyn Monroe. Her relationship with Miller prompted some negative comments from the press, including <a href="Walter%20Winchell">Walter Winchell</a>'s statement that "America's best-known blonde moving picture star is now the darling of the left-wing intelligentsia." Monroe and Miller were married in a civil ceremony at the Westchester County Court in <a href="White%20Plains%2C%20New%20York">White Plains, New York</a>, on June 29, and two days later had a <a href="Jewish%20wedding">Jewish ceremony</a> at his agent's house at <a href="Waccabuc%2C%20New%20York">Waccabuc, New York</a>. With the marriage, Monroe <a href="Conversion%20to%20Judaism">converted</a> to Judaism, which led Egypt to ban all of her films. The media saw the union as mismatched given her star image as a sex symbol and his position as an intellectual, as demonstrated by "Variety"s headline "Egghead Weds Hourglass".
The drama "<a href="Bus%20Stop%20%281956%20film%29">Bus Stop</a>" was the first film that Monroe chose to make under the new contract; the movie was released in August 1956. She played Chérie, a saloon singer whose dreams of stardom are complicated by a naïve cowboy who falls in love with her. For the role, she learnt an <a href="Ozark%20English">Ozark accent</a>, chose costumes and make-up that lacked the glamour of her earlier films, and provided deliberately mediocre singing and dancing. <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> director <a href="Joshua%20Logan">Joshua Logan</a> agreed to direct, despite initially doubting her acting abilities and knowing of her reputation for being difficult. The filming took place in Idaho and Arizona in early 1956, with Monroe "technically in charge" as the head of MMP, occasionally making decisions on cinematography and with Logan adapting to her chronic lateness and perfectionism.

The experience changed Logan's opinion of Monroe, and he later compared her to <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> in her ability to blend comedy and tragedy. "Bus Stop" became a box office success, grossing $4.25 million, and received mainly favorable reviews. "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Review%20of%20Literature">The Saturday Review of Literature</a>" wrote that Monroe's performance "effectively dispels once and for all the notion that she is merely a glamour personality" and Crowther proclaimed: "Hold on to your chairs, everybody, and get set for a rattling surprise. Marilyn Monroe has finally proved herself an actress." She received a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Golden Globe</a> for Best Actress nomination for her performance.
In August 1956, Monroe began filming MMP's first independent production, "<a href="The%20Prince%20and%20the%20Showgirl">The Prince and the Showgirl</a>", at <a href="Pinewood%20Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> in England. It was based on <a href="Terence%20Rattigan">Terence Rattigan</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sleeping%20Prince%20%28play%29">The Sleeping Prince</a>", a play about an affair between a showgirl and a prince in the 1910s. The main roles had first been played on stage by <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> and <a href="Vivien%20Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>; he reprised his role and directed and co-produced the film. The production was complicated by conflicts between him and Monroe. He angered her with the patronizing statement "All you have to do is be sexy" and his attempts to get her to replicate Leigh's interpretation. He also disliked the constant presence of Paula Strasberg, Monroe's acting coach, on set.

In retaliation to what she considered Olivier's "condescending" behavior, Monroe deliberately arrived hours late and became uncooperative, stating later that "if you don't respect your artists, they can't work well." Her drug use escalated and, according to Spoto, she became pregnant and miscarried during the production. She also had arguments with Greene over how MMP should be run, including whether Miller should join the company. Despite the difficulties, the film was completed on schedule by the end of the year. It was released to mixed reviews in June 1957 and proved unpopular with American audiences. It was better received in Europe, where she was awarded the Italian <a href="David%20di%20Donatello">David di Donatello</a> and the French <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Award">Crystal Star</a> awards and was nominated for a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a>.

After returning to the United States, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus from work to concentrate on married life on the East Coast. She and Miller split their time between their Manhattan apartment and an eighteenth-century farmhouse that they purchased in <a href="Roxbury%2C%20Connecticut">Roxbury, Connecticut</a>; they spent the summer in <a href="Amagansett%2C%20New%20York">Amagansett, Long Island</a>. She became pregnant in mid-1957, but it was <a href="ectopic%20pregnancy">ectopic</a> and had to be terminated. She suffered a miscarriage a year later. Her <a href="gynaecology">gynecological</a> problems were largely caused by <a href="endometriosis">endometriosis</a>, a disease from which she suffered throughout her adult life. Monroe was also briefly hospitalized during this time due to a barbiturate overdose. During the hiatus, she dismissed Greene from MMP and bought his share of the company as they could not settle their disagreements and she had begun to suspect that he was embezzling money from the company.
Monroe returned to Hollywood in July 1958 to act opposite <a href="Jack%20Lemmon">Jack Lemmon</a> and <a href="Tony%20Curtis">Tony Curtis</a> in Billy Wilder's comedy on gender roles, "<a href="Some%20Like%20It%20Hot">Some Like It Hot</a>". Although she considered the role of Sugar Kane another "dumb blonde", she accepted it due to Miller's encouragement and the offer of receiving ten percent of the film's profits in addition to her standard pay. The difficulties during the film's production have since become "legendary". Monroe would demand dozens of re-takes, and could not remember her lines or act as directed – Curtis famously stated that kissing her was "like kissing <a href="Hitler">Hitler</a>" due to the number of re-takes. Monroe herself privately likened the production to a sinking ship and commented on her co-stars and director saying "[but] why should I worry, I have no phallic symbol to lose." Many of the problems stemmed from a conflict between her and Wilder, who also had a reputation for being difficult, on how she should play the character. Monroe made Wilder angry by asking him to alter many of her scenes, which in turn made her stage fright worse, and it is suggested that she deliberately ruined several scenes to act them her way.

In the end, Wilder was happy with Monroe's performance and stated: "Anyone can remember lines, but it takes a real artist to come on the set and not know her lines and yet give the performance she did!" Despite the difficulties of its production, "Some Like It Hot" became a critical and commercial success when it was released in March 1959. Monroe's performance earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and prompted "Variety" to call her "a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing that just can't be beat". It has been voted one of the <a href="List%20of%20films%20considered%20the%20best">best films ever made</a> in polls by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a>, and "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>".

After "Some Like It Hot", Monroe took another hiatus until late 1959, when she returned to Hollywood and starred in the musical comedy "<a href="Let%27s%20Make%20Love">Let's Make Love</a>", about an actress and a millionaire who fall in love when performing in a satirical play. She chose <a href="George%20Cukor">George Cukor</a> to direct and Miller re-wrote portions of the script, which she considered weak; she accepted the part solely because she was behind on her contract with Fox, having only made one of four promised films. The film's production was delayed by her frequent absences from the set. Monroe and her co-star <a href="Yves%20Montand">Yves Montand</a> had an affair, which was widely reported by the press and used in the film's publicity campaign. "Let's Make Love" was unsuccessful upon its release in September 1960; Crowther described Monroe as appearing "rather untidy" and "lacking ... the old Monroe dynamism", and Hedda Hopper called the film "the most vulgar picture she's ever done". <a href="Truman%20Capote">Truman Capote</a> lobbied for her to play Holly Golightly in <a href="Breakfast%20at%20Tiffany%27s%20%28film%29">a film adaptation</a> of "<a href="Breakfast%20at%20Tiffany%27s%20%28novella%29">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a>", but the role went to <a href="Audrey%20Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> as its producers feared that Monroe would complicate the production.

The last film that Monroe completed was John Huston's "<a href="The%20Misfits%20%28film%29">The Misfits</a>", which Miller had written to provide her with a dramatic role. She played Roslyn, a recently divorced woman who becomes friends with three aging cowboys, played by <a href="Clark%20Gable">Clark Gable</a>, <a href="Eli%20Wallach">Eli Wallach</a> and <a href="Montgomery%20Clift">Montgomery Clift</a>. The filming in the Nevada desert between July and November 1960 was again difficult. The four-year marriage of Monroe and Miller was effectively over, and he began a new relationship with set photographer <a href="Inge%20Morath">Inge Morath</a>. Monroe disliked that he had based her role partly on her life, and thought it inferior to the male roles; she also struggled with Miller's habit of re-writing scenes the night before filming. Her health was also failing: she was in pain from <a href="gallstone">gallstone</a>s, and her drug addiction was so severe that her make-up usually had to be applied while she was still asleep under the influence of barbiturates. In August, filming was halted for her to spend a week <a href="drug%20detoxification">detoxing</a> in a Los Angeles hospital. Despite her problems, Huston stated that when Monroe was playing Roslyn, she "was not pretending to an emotion. It was the real thing. She would go deep down within herself and find it and bring it up into consciousness."
Monroe and Miller separated after filming wrapped, and she was granted a <a href="Mexican%20divorce">quick divorce</a> in Mexico in January 1961. "The Misfits" was released the following month, but it failed at the box office. Its reviews were mixed, with "Variety" complaining of frequently "choppy" character development, and Bosley Crowther calling Monroe "completely blank and unfathomable" and stating that "unfortunately for the film's structure, everything turns upon her". Despite the film's initial failure, it has received more favorable reviews from critics and film scholars in the 21st century. <a href="Geoff%20Andrew">Geoff Andrew</a> of the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> has called it a classic, Huston scholar Tony Tracy has described Monroe's performance the "most mature interpretation of her career", and Geoffrey McNab of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" has praised her for being "extraordinary" in portraying Roslyn's "power of empathy". In August 2018 a lost Marilyn Monroe <a href="nude%20scene">nude scene</a>, which shows Monroe and Clark Gable, was found.

Monroe was next to star in a television adaptation of <a href="W.%20Somerset%20Maugham">W. Somerset Maugham</a>'s short story "Rain" for <a href="NBC">NBC</a>, but the project fell through as the network did not want to hire her choice of director, Lee Strasberg. Instead of working, she spent the first six months of 1961 preoccupied by health problems. Monroe underwent surgery for her endometriosis, had a <a href="cholecystectomy">cholecystectomy</a>, and spent four weeks in hospital care – including a brief stint in a <a href="mental%20ward">mental ward</a> – for depression. She was helped by her ex-husband Joe DiMaggio, with whom she now rekindled a friendship. In spring 1961, Monroe also moved back to California after six years on the East Coast. She dated Frank Sinatra for several months, and in early 1962 purchased a house in <a href="Brentwood%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Brentwood, Los Angeles</a>.
Monroe returned to the public eye in the spring of 1962; she received a "World Film Favorite" Golden Globe Award and began to shoot a new film for 20th Century Fox, "<a href="Something%27s%20Got%20to%20Give">Something's Got to Give</a>", a re-make of "<a href="My%20Favorite%20Wife">My Favorite Wife</a>" (1940). It was to be co-produced by MMP, directed by George Cukor and to co-star <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a> and <a href="Cyd%20Charisse">Cyd Charisse</a>. Days before filming began, Monroe caught <a href="sinusitis">sinusitis</a>; despite medical advice to postpone the production, Fox began it as planned in late April. Monroe was too ill to work for the majority of the next six weeks, but despite confirmations by multiple doctors, the studio tried to put pressure on her by alleging publicly that she was faking it. On May 19, she took a break to sing "<a href="Happy%20Birthday%2C%20Mr.%20President">Happy Birthday</a>" on stage at President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s birthday celebration at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden%20%281925%29">Madison Square Garden</a> in New York. She drew attention with her costume: a beige, skintight dress covered in rhinestones, which made her appear nude. Monroe's trip to New York caused even more irritation for Fox executives, who had wanted her to cancel it.

Monroe next filmed a scene for "Something's Got to Give" in which she swam naked in a swimming pool. To generate advance publicity, the press was invited to take photographs of the scene, which were later published in "Life"; this was the first time that a major star had posed nude while at the height of their career. When she was again on sick leave for several days, Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film running behind schedule when it was already struggling to cover the rising costs of "<a href="Cleopatra%20%281963%20film%29">Cleopatra</a>" (1963). On June 7, Fox fired Monroe and sued her for $750,000 in damages. She was replaced by <a href="Lee%20Remick">Lee Remick</a>, but after Martin refused to make the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as well and shut down the production. The studio blamed Monroe for the film's demise and began spreading negative publicity about her, even alleging that she was mentally disturbed.

Fox soon regretted its decision and re-opened negotiations with Monroe later in June; a settlement about a new contract, including re-commencing "Something's Got to Give" and a starring role in the <a href="black%20comedy">black comedy</a> "<a href="What%20a%20Way%20to%20Go%21">What a Way to Go!</a>" (1964), was reached later that summer. To repair her public image, Monroe engaged in several publicity ventures, including interviews for "Life" and "<a href="Cosmopolitan%20%28magazine%29">Cosmopolitan</a>" and her first photo shoot for "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>". For "Vogue", she and photographer <a href="Bert%20Stern">Bert Stern</a> collaborated for two series of photographs, one a standard fashion editorial and another of her posing nude, which were both later published posthumously with the title "<a href="The%20Last%20Sitting">The Last Sitting</a>". In the last weeks of her life, she was also planning on starring in a biopic of <a href="Jean%20Harlow">Jean Harlow</a>.

During the final months of her life, Monroe lived at <a href="12305%20Fifth%20Helena%20Drive">12305 Fifth Helena Drive</a> in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Her housekeeper Eunice Murray was staying overnight at the home on the evening of August 5, 1962. Murray awoke at 3:00a.m. on August 6 and sensed that something was wrong. Although she saw light from under Monroe's bedroom door, she was unable to get a response and found the door locked. Murray then called Monroe's psychiatrist, <a href="Ralph%20Greenson">Dr. Ralph Greenson</a>, who arrived at the house shortly after and broke into the bedroom through a window, finding Monroe dead in her bed. She was pronounced dead by her physician, Dr. Hyman Engelberg, who arrived at the house at around 3:50a.m. At 4:25a.m., they notified the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department">Los Angeles Police Department</a>.

Monroe had died between 8:30 p.m. and 10:30p.m. on August 5, and the <a href="toxicology">toxicology</a> report revealed that the cause of death was <a href="Barbiturate%20overdose">acute barbiturate poisoning</a>. She had 8 <a href="Milligram%20per%20cent">mg%</a> (<a href="milligrams">milligrams</a> per 100 <a href="litre">milliliters</a> of solution) <a href="chloral%20hydrate">chloral hydrate</a> and 4.5 mg% of <a href="pentobarbital">pentobarbital</a> (Nembutal) in her blood, and 13 mg% of pentobarbital in her liver. Empty medicine bottles were found next to her bed. The possibility that Monroe had accidentally overdosed was ruled out because the dosages found in her body were several times over the lethal limit.

The <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%20Department%20of%20Medical%20Examiner-Coroner">Los Angeles County Coroners Office</a> was assisted in their investigation by the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Team, who had expert knowledge on suicide. Monroe's doctors stated that she had been "prone to severe fears and frequent depressions" with "abrupt and unpredictable mood changes", and had overdosed several times in the past, possibly intentionally. Due to these facts and the lack of any indication of foul play, deputy coroner <a href="Thomas%20Noguchi">Thomas Noguchi</a> classified her death as a probable suicide.
Monroe was an international star and her sudden death was front-page news in the United States and Europe. According to Lois Banner, "it's said that the suicide rate in Los Angeles doubled the month after she died; the circulation rate of most newspapers expanded that month", and the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" reported that they had received hundreds of phone calls from members of the public who were requesting information about her death. French artist <a href="Jean%20Cocteau">Jean Cocteau</a> commented that her death "should serve as a terrible lesson to all those, whose chief occupation consists of spying on and tormenting film stars", her former co-star Laurence Olivier deemed her "the complete victim of ballyhoo and sensation", and "Bus Stop" director Joshua Logan stated that she was "one of the most unappreciated people in the world". Her funeral, held at the <a href="Westwood%20Village%20Memorial%20Park%20Cemetery">Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery</a> on August 8, was private and attended by only her closest associates. The service was arranged by Joe DiMaggio and her business manager Inez Melson. Hundreds of spectators crowded the streets around the cemetery. Monroe was later entombed at crypt No. 24 at the Corridor of Memories.

In the following decades, several <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theories</a>, including murder and accidental overdose, have been introduced to contradict suicide as the cause of Monroe's death. The speculation that Monroe had been murdered first gained mainstream attention with the publication of <a href="Norman%20Mailer">Norman Mailer</a>'s "" in 1973, and in the following years became widespread enough for the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%20District%20Attorney">Los Angeles County District Attorney</a> <a href="John%20Van%20de%20Kamp">John Van de Kamp</a> to conduct a "threshold investigation" in 1982 to see whether a criminal investigation should be opened. No evidence of foul play was found.

When 20th Century-Fox began to develop Monroe's star image, they wanted her to replace the aging Betty Grable, who was their most popular "blonde bombshell" of the 1940s. The 1940s had been the heyday of actresses who were perceived as tough and smart, such as <a href="Katharine%20Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> and <a href="Barbara%20Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a>, film stars who had appealed to women-dominated audiences. The studio wanted Monroe to be a star of the new decade who would draw men to movie theaters. From the beginning, she played a significant part in the creation of her public image, and towards the end of her career Monroe exerted almost full control over it. Monroe devised many of her publicity strategies, cultivated friendships with gossip columnists such as <a href="Sidney%20Skolsky">Sidney Skolsky</a> and <a href="Louella%20Parsons">Louella Parsons</a>, and controlled the use of her images. In addition to Grable, she was often compared to another iconic blonde, 1930s film star <a href="Jean%20Harlow">Jean Harlow</a>. The comparison was prompted partly by Monroe, who named Harlow as her childhood idol, wanted to play her in a biopic, and even employed Harlow's hair stylist to color her hair.
Monroe's screen persona centered on her blonde hair and the stereotypes associated with it, especially dumbness, naïveté, sexual availability and artificiality. She often used a breathy, childish voice in her films, and in interviews gave the impression that everything she said was "utterly innocent and uncalculated", parodying herself with <a href="double%20entendre">double entendre</a>s that came to be known as "Monroeisms". For example, when she was asked what she had on in the 1949 nude photo shoot, she replied, "I had the radio on". Monroe began her career as a pin-up model, and her hourglass figure was often one of her most noted features. Film scholar <a href="Richard%20Dyer">Richard Dyer</a> wrote that Monroe was often positioned so that her curvy silhouette was on display, and that she often posed like a pin-up in her publicity photos. Her distinctive, hip-swinging walk also drew attention to her body and earned her the nickname "the girl with the horizontal walk".

Clothing played an important factor in Monroe's star image. She often wore white to emphasize her blondness, and drew attention by wearing revealing outfits that showed off her figure. Her publicity stunts often revolved around her clothing, which exposed large amounts of her body or even a <a href="wardrobe%20malfunction">wardrobe malfunction</a>, such as when one of the shoulder straps of her dress suddenly snapped during a press conference. In press stories, Monroe was portrayed as the embodiment of the <a href="American%20Dream">American Dream</a>, a girl who had risen from a miserable childhood to Hollywood stardom. In her studio biographies, stories of her time spent in foster families and an orphanage were exaggerated and even partly fabricated.

Although Monroe's typecast screen persona as a dim-witted but sexually attractive blonde was a carefully crafted act, audiences and film critics believed it to be her real personality and that she was not acting in her comedies. This became an obstacle in her later career, when she wanted to change her public image and pursue other kinds of roles, or to be respected as a businesswoman. Academic Sarah Churchwell studied narratives about Monroe and has stated:

Lois Banner has written that Monroe often subtly parodied her status as a sex symbol in her films and public appearances, and that "the 'Marilyn Monroe' character she created was a brilliant archetype, who stands between <a href="Mae%20West">Mae West</a> and <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> in the tradition of twentieth-century gender tricksters." Monroe herself stated that she was influenced by West, learning "a few tricks from her – that impression of laughing at, or mocking, her own sexuality". In the 1950s, she also studied comedy in classes given by mime and dancer Lotte Goslar, famous for her comic stage performances, and had her accompany her on film sets to instruct her. In "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", one of the films in which she played an archetypal dumb blonde, Monroe had the sentence "I can be smart when it's important, but most men don't like it" added to her character's lines in the script.
Dyer has stated that Monroe's star image was created mainly for the <a href="male%20gaze">male gaze</a> and that she usually played "the girl", who is defined solely by her gender, in her films. Her roles were almost always chorus girls, secretaries, or models; occupations where "the woman is on show, there for the pleasure of men." Film scholar Thomas Harris, who analyzed Monroe's public image in 1957, wrote that her working class roots and lack of family made her appear more sexually available, "the ideal playmate", in contrast to her contemporary, <a href="Grace%20Kelly">Grace Kelly</a>, who was also marketed as an attractive blonde, but due to her upper-class background came to be seen as a sophisticated actress, unattainable for the majority of male viewers.

According to Dyer, Monroe became "virtually a household name for sex" in the 1950s and "her image has to be situated in the flux of ideas about morality and sexuality that characterised the fifties in America", such as <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freudian</a> ideas about sex, the <a href="Kinsey%20Reports">Kinsey report</a> (1953), and <a href="Betty%20Friedan">Betty Friedan</a>'s "<a href="The%20Feminine%20Mystique">The Feminine Mystique</a>" (1963). By appearing vulnerable and unaware of her sex appeal, Monroe was the first sex symbol to present sex as natural and without danger, in contrast to the 1940s "femme fatales". Spoto likewise describes her as the embodiment of "the postwar ideal of the American girl, soft, transparently needy, worshipful of men, naïve, offering sex without demands", which is echoed in <a href="Molly%20Haskell">Molly Haskell</a>'s statement that "she was the fifties fiction, the lie that a woman had no sexual needs, that she is there to cater to, or enhance, a man's needs." Monroe's contemporary Norman Mailer wrote that "Marilyn suggested sex might be difficult and dangerous with others, but ice cream with her", while <a href="Groucho%20Marx">Groucho Marx</a> characterized her as "Mae West, <a href="Theda%20Bara">Theda Bara</a>, and <a href="Little%20Bo%20Peep">Bo Peep</a> all rolled into one". According to Haskell, due to her status as a sex symbol, Monroe was less popular with women than with men, as they "couldn't identify with her and didn't support her", although this would change after her death.

Dyer has also argued that Monroe's platinum blonde hair became such a defining feature because it made her "racially unambiguous" and exclusively white just as the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a> was beginning, and that she should be seen as emblematic of racism in twentieth-century popular culture. Banner agreed that it may not be a coincidence that Monroe launched a trend of platinum blonde actresses during the civil rights movement, but has also criticized Dyer, pointing out that in her highly publicized private life, Monroe associated with people who were seen as "<a href="white%20ethnic">white ethnic</a>s", such as Joe DiMaggio (<a href="Italian-American">Italian-American</a>) and Arthur Miller (Jewish). According to Banner, she sometimes challenged prevailing racial norms in her publicity photographs; for example, in an image featured in "<a href="Look%20%28American%20magazine%29">Look</a>" in 1951, she was shown in revealing clothes while practicing with <a href="African-American">African-American</a> singing coach <a href="Phil%20Moore%20%28jazz%20musician%29">Phil Moore</a>.
Monroe was perceived as a specifically American star, "a national institution as well known as hot dogs, apple pie, or baseball" according to "Photoplay". Banner calls her the symbol of <a href="populuxe">populuxe</a>, a star whose joyful and glamorous public image "helped the nation cope with its paranoia in the 1950s about the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, the atom bomb, and the totalitarian communist Soviet Union". Historian Fiona Handyside writes that the French female audiences associated whiteness/blondness with American modernity and cleanliness, and so Monroe came to symbolize a modern, "liberated" woman whose life takes place in the public sphere. Film historian <a href="Laura%20Mulvey">Laura Mulvey</a> has written of her as an endorsement for American consumer culture:

Twentieth Century Fox profited from Monroe's popularity by cultivating several lookalike actresses that included <a href="Jayne%20Mansfield">Jayne Mansfield</a> and <a href="Sheree%20North">Sheree North</a>. Other studios also attempted to create their own Monroes: <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a> with <a href="Mamie%20Van%20Doren">Mamie Van Doren</a>, Columbia Pictures with <a href="Kim%20Novak">Kim Novak</a>, and <a href="Rank%20Organisation">Rank Organisation</a> with <a href="Diana%20Dors">Diana Dors</a>.

According to "The Guide to United States Popular Culture", "as an icon of American popular culture, Monroe's few rivals in popularity include <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> ... no other star has ever inspired such a wide range of emotions – from lust to pity, from envy to remorse." Art historian <a href="Gail%20Levin%20%28art%20historian%29">Gail Levin</a> stated that Monroe may have been "the most photographed person of the 20th century", and The American Film Institute has named her <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Stars">the sixth greatest female screen legend</a> in <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">American film history</a>. The <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> has included her on their list of "100 Most Significant Americans of All Time", and both "Variety" and <a href="VH1">VH1</a> have placed her in the top ten in their rankings of the greatest popular culture icons of the twentieth century.Hundreds of books have been written about Monroe. She has been the subject of films, plays, operas, and songs, and has influenced artists and entertainers such as <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> and <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>. She also remains a valuable brand: her image and name have been licensed for hundreds of products, and she has been featured in advertising for multinational corporations and brands such as <a href="Max%20Factor">Max Factor</a>, <a href="Chanel">Chanel</a>, <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a>, and <a href="Absolut%20Vodka">Absolut Vodka</a>.

Monroe's enduring popularity is linked to her conflicted public image. On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon and one of the most famous stars of <a href="classical%20Hollywood%20cinema">classical Hollywood cinema</a>. On the other, she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, as well as her death and the conspiracy theories that surrounded it. She has been written about by scholars and journalists who are interested in gender and feminism; these writers include <a href="Gloria%20Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a>, <a href="Jacqueline%20Rose">Jacqueline Rose</a>, Molly Haskell, Sarah Churchwell, and Lois Banner. Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her as a victim of the studio system. Others, such as Haskell, Rose, and Churchwell, have instead stressed Monroe's proactive role in her career and her participation in the creation of her public persona.
Due to the contrast between her stardom and troubled private life, Monroe is closely linked to broader discussions about modern phenomena such as mass media, fame, and consumer culture. According to academic Susanne Hamscha, Monroe has continued relevance to ongoing discussions about modern society, and she is "never completely situated in one time or place" but has become "a surface on which narratives of American culture can be (re-)constructed", and "functions as a cultural type that can be reproduced, transformed, translated into new contexts, and enacted by other people". Similarly, Banner has called Monroe the "eternal shapeshifter" who is re-created by "each generation, even each individual ... to their own specifications".

While Monroe remains a cultural icon, critics are divided on her legacy as an actress. <a href="David%20Thomson%20%28film%20critic%29">David Thomson</a> called her body of work "insubstantial" and <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a> wrote that she could not act, but rather "used her lack of an actress's skills to amuse the public. She had the wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into acting – and vice versa; she did what others had the 'good taste' not to do". In contrast, according to <a href="Peter%20Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a>, Monroe was a talented comedian who "understood how comedy achieved its effects", and <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> wrote that "Monroe's eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious, but studios put up with her long after any other actress would have been blackballed because what they got back on the screen was magical". Similarly, <a href="Jonathan%20Rosenbaum">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a> stated that "she subtly subverted the sexist content of her material" and that "the difficulty some people have discerning Monroe's intelligence as an actress seems rooted in the ideology of a repressive era, when superfeminine women weren't supposed to be smart".

Group (mathematics)

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, a group is a <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> equipped with a <a href="binary%20operation">binary operation</a> which combines any two <a href="element%20%28mathematics%29">elements</a> to form a third element in such a way that four conditions called group <a href="axiom">axiom</a>s are satisfied, namely <a href="Closure%20%28mathematics%29">closure</a>, <a href="associativity">associativity</a>, <a href="identity%20element">identity</a> and <a href="Inverse%20elements">invertibility</a>. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of <a href="integer">integer</a>s together with the <a href="addition">addition</a> operation, but groups are encountered in numerous areas within and outside mathematics, and help focusing on essential structural aspects, by detaching them from the concrete nature of the subject of the study.

Groups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of <a href="symmetry">symmetry</a>. For example, a <a href="symmetry%20group">symmetry group</a> encodes symmetry features of a <a href="geometry">geometrical</a> object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. <a href="Lie%20group">Lie group</a>s are the symmetry groups used in the <a href="Standard%20Model">Standard Model</a> of <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>; <a href="Poincar%C3%A9%20group">Poincaré group</a>s, which are also Lie groups, can express the physical symmetry underlying <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a>; and <a href="point%20group">point group</a>s are used to help understand <a href="Molecular%20symmetry">symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry</a>.

The concept of a group arose from the study of <a href="polynomial%20equations">polynomial equations</a>, starting with <a href="%C3%89variste%20Galois">Évariste Galois</a> in the 1830s. After contributions from other fields such as <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a> and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870. Modern <a href="group%20theory">group theory</a>—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right. To explore groups, mathematicians have devised <a href="Glossary%20of%20group%20theory">various notions</a> to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as <a href="subgroup">subgroup</a>s, <a href="quotient%20group">quotient group</a>s and <a href="simple%20group">simple group</a>s. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of <a href="representation%20theory">representation theory</a> (that is, through the <a href="group%20representation">representations of the group</a>) and of <a href="computational%20group%20theory">computational group theory</a>. A theory has been developed for <a href="finite%20group">finite group</a>s, which culminated with the <a href="classification%20of%20finite%20simple%20groups">classification of finite simple groups</a>, completed in 2004. Since the mid-1980s, <a href="geometric%20group%20theory">geometric group theory</a>, which studies <a href="finitely%20generated%20group">finitely generated group</a>s as geometric objects, has become an active area in group theory.

One of the most familiar groups is the set of <a href="integers">integers</a> formula_1 which consists of the numbers
The following properties of integer addition serve as a model for the group axioms given in the definition below.


The integers, together with the operation +, form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To appropriately understand these structures as a collective, the following <a href="definition">definition</a> is developed.

A group is a <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a>, "G", together with an <a href="Binary%20operation">operation</a> • (called the "group law" of "G") that combines any two <a href="element%20%28mathematics%29">elements</a> "a" and "b" to form another element, denoted or "ab". To qualify as a group, the set and operation, , must satisfy four requirements known as the "group axioms":


The result of an operation may depend on the order of the operands. In other words, the result of combining element "a" with element "b" need not yield the same result as combining element "b" with element "a"; the equation
may not always be true. This equation always holds in the group of integers under addition, because for any two integers (<a href="commutativity">commutativity</a> of addition). Groups for which the commutativity equation always holds are called "<a href="abelian%20group">abelian group</a>s" (in honor of <a href="Niels%20Henrik%20Abel">Niels Henrik Abel</a>). The symmetry group described in the following section is an example of a group that is not abelian.

The identity element of a group "G" is often written as 1 or 1, a notation inherited from the <a href="multiplicative%20identity">multiplicative identity</a>. If a group is abelian, then one may choose to denote the group operation by + and the identity element by 0; in that case, the group is called an additive group. The identity element can also be written as "id".

The set "G" is called the "underlying set" of the group . Often the group's underlying set "G" is used as a short name for the group . Along the same lines, shorthand expressions such as "a subset of the group "G"" or "an element of group "G"" are used when what is actually meant is "a subset of the underlying set "G" of the group " or "an element of the underlying set "G" of the group ". Usually, it is clear from the context whether a symbol like "G" refers to a group or to an underlying set.

An alternate (but equivalent) definition is to expand the structure of a group to define a group as a set equipped with three operations satisfying the same axioms as above, with the "there exists" part removed in the two last axioms, these operations being
the group law, as above, which is a <a href="binary%20operation">binary operation</a>,
the "inverse operation", which is a <a href="unary%20operation">unary operation</a> and maps to formula_2
and the identity element, which is viewed as a <a href="0-ary%20function">0-ary operation</a>.

As this formulation of the definition avoids <a href="existential%20quantifier">existential quantifier</a>s, it is generally preferred for <a href="computational%20group%20theory">computing with groups</a> and for <a href="computer-aided%20proof">computer-aided proof</a>s. This formulation exhibits groups as a variety of <a href="universal%20algebra">universal algebra</a>. It is also useful for talking of properties of the inverse operation, as needed for defining <a href="topological%20group">topological group</a>s and <a href="group%20object">group object</a>s.

Two figures in the plane are <a href="congruence%20%28geometry%29">congruent</a> if one can be changed into the other using a combination of <a href="rotation%20%28mathematics%29">rotation</a>s, <a href="reflection%20%28mathematics%29">reflection</a>s, and <a href="translation%20%28geometry%29">translation</a>s. Any figure is congruent to itself. However, some figures are congruent to themselves in more than one way, and these extra congruences are called <a href="symmetry">symmetries</a>. A square has eight symmetries. These are:

These symmetries are represented by functions. Each of these functions sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry. For example, r sends a point to its rotation 90° clockwise around the square's center, and f sends a point to its reflection across the square's vertical middle line. Composing two of these symmetry functions gives another symmetry function. These symmetries determine a group called the <a href="dihedral%20group">dihedral group</a> of degree 4 and denoted D. The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetry functions, and the group operation is <a href="function%20composition">function composition</a>. Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to the square, and the second one to the result of the first application. The result of performing first "a" and then "b" is written symbolically "from right to left" as
The right-to-left notation is the same notation that is used for composition of functions.

The <a href="group%20table">group table</a> on the right lists the results of all such compositions possible. For example, rotating by 270° clockwise (r) and then reflecting horizontally (f) is the same as performing a reflection along the diagonal (f). Using the above symbols, highlighted in blue in the group table:

Given this set of symmetries and the described operation, the group axioms can be understood as follows:
In contrast to the group of integers above, where the order of the operation is irrelevant, it does matter in D: but In other words, D is not abelian, which makes the group structure more difficult than the integers introduced first.

The modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics. The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of <a href="polynomial%20equation">polynomial equation</a>s of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician <a href="%C3%89variste%20Galois">Évariste Galois</a>, extending prior work of <a href="Paolo%20Ruffini">Paolo Ruffini</a> and <a href="Joseph-Louis%20Lagrange">Joseph-Louis Lagrange</a>, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the <a href="symmetry%20group">symmetry group</a> of its <a href="root%20of%20a%20function">roots</a> (solutions). The elements of such a <a href="Galois%20group">Galois group</a> correspond to certain <a href="permutation">permutation</a>s of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously. More general <a href="permutation%20group">permutation group</a>s were investigated in particular by <a href="Augustin%20Louis%20Cauchy">Augustin Louis Cauchy</a>. <a href="Arthur%20Cayley">Arthur Cayley</a>'s "On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θ = 1" (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a <a href="finite%20group">finite group</a>.

Geometry was a second field in which groups were used systematically, especially symmetry groups as part of <a href="Felix%20Klein">Felix Klein</a>'s 1872 <a href="Erlangen%20program">Erlangen program</a>. After novel geometries such as <a href="hyperbolic%20geometry">hyperbolic</a> and <a href="projective%20geometry">projective geometry</a> had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, <a href="Sophus%20Lie">Sophus Lie</a> founded the study of <a href="Lie%20group">Lie group</a>s in 1884.

The third field contributing to group theory was <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>. Certain <a href="abelian%20group">abelian group</a> structures had been used implicitly in <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>' number-theoretical work "<a href="Disquisitiones%20Arithmeticae">Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</a>" (1798), and more explicitly by <a href="Leopold%20Kronecker">Leopold Kronecker</a>. In 1847, <a href="Ernst%20Kummer">Ernst Kummer</a> made early attempts to prove <a href="Fermat%27s%20Last%20Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> by developing <a href="class%20group">groups describing factorization</a> into <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s.

The convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with <a href="Camille%20Jordan">Camille Jordan</a>'s "Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques" (1870). <a href="Walther%20von%20Dyck">Walther von Dyck</a> (1882) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations, and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an "abstract group", in the terminology of the time. As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of <a href="Ferdinand%20Georg%20Frobenius">Ferdinand Georg Frobenius</a> and <a href="William%20Burnside">William Burnside</a>, who worked on <a href="representation%20theory">representation theory</a> of finite groups, <a href="Richard%20Brauer">Richard Brauer</a>'s <a href="modular%20representation%20theory">modular representation theory</a> and <a href="Issai%20Schur">Issai Schur</a>'s papers. The theory of Lie groups, and more generally <a href="locally%20compact%20group">locally compact group</a>s was studied by <a href="Hermann%20Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a>, <a href="%C3%89lie%20Cartan">Élie Cartan</a> and many others. Its algebraic counterpart, the theory of <a href="algebraic%20group">algebraic group</a>s, was first shaped by <a href="Claude%20Chevalley">Claude Chevalley</a> (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of <a href="Armand%20Borel">Armand Borel</a> and <a href="Jacques%20Tits">Jacques Tits</a>.

The <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>'s 1960–61 Group Theory Year brought together group theorists such as <a href="Daniel%20Gorenstein">Daniel Gorenstein</a>, <a href="John%20G.%20Thompson">John G. Thompson</a> and <a href="Walter%20Feit">Walter Feit</a>, laying the foundation of a collaboration that, with input from numerous other mathematicians, led to the <a href="classification%20of%20finite%20simple%20groups">classification of finite simple groups</a>, with the final step taken by <a href="Michael%20Aschbacher">Aschbacher</a> and Smith in 2004. This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size, in both length of proof and number of researchers. Research is ongoing to simplify the proof of this classification. These days, group theory is still a highly active mathematical branch, impacting many other fields.

Basic facts about all groups that can be obtained directly from the group axioms are commonly subsumed under "elementary group theory". For example, <a href="Mathematical%20induction">repeated</a> applications of the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity of
generalizes to more than three factors. Because this implies that parentheses can be inserted anywhere within such a series of terms, parentheses are usually omitted.

The axioms may be weakened to assert only the existence of a <a href="left%20identity">left identity</a> and <a href="left%20inverse%20element">left inverse</a>s. Both can be shown to be actually two-sided, so the resulting definition is equivalent to the one given above.

Two important consequences of the group axioms are the uniqueness of the identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in a group, and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary to speak of "the" identity, and "the" inverse of an element.

To prove the uniqueness of an inverse element of "a", suppose that "a" has two inverses, denoted "b" and "c", in a group ("G", •). Then

The term "b" on the first line above and the "c" on the last are equal, since they are connected by a chain of equalities. In other words, there is only one inverse element of "a". Similarly, to prove that the identity element of a group is unique, assume "G" is a group with two identity elements "e" and "f". Then "e" = "e" • "f" = "f", hence "e" and "f" are equal.

In groups, the existence of inverse elements implies that <a href="division%20%28mathematics%29">division</a> is possible: given elements "a" and "b" of the group "G", there is exactly one solution "x" in "G" to the <a href="equation">equation</a> , namely . In fact, we have 
Uniqueness results by multiplying the two sides of the equation by . The element , often denoted , is called the "right quotient" of "b" by "a", or the result of the "right division" of "b" by "a".

Similarly there is exactly one solution "y" in "G" to the equation , namely . This solution is the "left quotient" of "b" by "a", and is sometimes denoted .

In general and may be different, but, if the group operation is <a href="commutative">commutative</a> (that is, if the group is <a href="abelian%20group">abelian</a>), they are equal. In this case, the group operation is often denoted as an <a href="addition">addition</a>, and one talks of "subtraction" and "difference" instead of division and quotient.

A consequence of this is that multiplication by a group element "g" is a <a href="bijection">bijection</a>. Specifically, if "g" is an element of the group "G", the <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">function (mathematics)</a> from "G" to itself that maps to is a bijection. This function is called the "left translation" by "g" . Similarly, the "right translation" by "g" is the bijection from "G" to itself, that maps "h" to . If "G" is abelian, the left and the right translation by a group element are the same.

To understand groups beyond the level of mere symbolic manipulations as above, more structural concepts have to be employed. There is a conceptual principle underlying all of the following notions: to take advantage of the structure offered by groups (which sets, being "structureless", do not have), constructions related to groups have to be "compatible" with the group operation. This compatibility manifests itself in the following notions in various ways. For example, groups can be related to each other via functions called group homomorphisms. By the mentioned principle, they are required to respect the group structures in a precise sense. The structure of groups can also be understood by breaking them into pieces called subgroups and quotient groups. The principle of "preserving structures"—a recurring topic in mathematics throughout—is an instance of working in a <a href="category%20%28mathematics%29">category</a>, in this case the <a href="category%20of%20groups">category of groups</a>.

"Group homomorphisms" are functions that preserve group structure. A function between two groups and is called a "homomorphism" if the equation
holds for all elements "g", "k" in "G". In other words, the result is the same when performing the group operation after or before applying the map "a". This requirement ensures that , and also for all "g" in "G". Thus a group homomorphism respects all the structure of "G" provided by the group axioms.

Two groups "G" and "H" are called "<a href="Group%20isomorphism">isomorphic</a>" if there exist group homomorphisms and , such that applying the two functions <a href="function%20composition">one after another</a> in each of the two possible orders gives the <a href="identity%20function">identity function</a>s of "G" and "H". That is, and for any "g" in "G" and "h" in "H". From an abstract point of view, isomorphic groups carry the same information. For example, proving that for some element "g" of "G" is <a href="Logical%20equivalence">equivalent</a> to proving that , because applying "a" to the first equality yields the second, and applying "b" to the second gives back the first.

Informally, a "subgroup" is a group "H" contained within a bigger one, "G". Concretely, the identity element of "G" is contained in "H", and whenever "h" and "h" are in "H", then so are and "h", so the elements of "H", equipped with the group operation on "G" restricted to "H", indeed form a group.

In the example above, the identity and the rotations constitute a subgroup highlighted in red in the group table above: any two rotations composed are still a rotation, and a rotation can be undone by (i.e., is inverse to) the complementary rotations 270° for 90°, 180° for 180°, and 90° for 270° (note that rotation in the opposite direction is not defined). The <a href="subgroup%20test">subgroup test</a> is a <a href="Necessary%20and%20sufficient%20conditions">necessary and sufficient condition</a> for a nonempty subset "H" of a group "G" to be a subgroup: it is sufficient to check that for all elements . Knowing <a href="lattice%20of%20subgroups">the subgroups</a> is important in understanding the group as a whole.

Given any subset "S" of a group "G", the subgroup generated by "S" consists of products of elements of "S" and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup of "G" containing "S". In the introductory example above, the subgroup generated by r and f consists of these two elements, the identity element id and . Again, this is a subgroup, because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses (which are, in this particular case, these same elements) yields an element of this subgroup.

In many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup. For example, in D above, once a reflection is performed, the square never gets back to the r configuration by just applying the rotation operations (and no further reflections), i.e., the rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been performed. Cosets are used to formalize this insight: a subgroup "H" defines left and right cosets, which can be thought of as translations of "H" by arbitrary group elements "g". In symbolic terms, the "left" and "right" cosets of "H" containing "g" are

The left cosets of any subgroup "H" form a <a href="Partition%20of%20a%20set">partition</a> of "G"; that is, the <a href="Union%20%28set%20theory%29">union</a> of all left cosets is equal to "G" and two left cosets are either equal or have an <a href="empty%20set">empty</a> <a href="Intersection%20%28set%20theory%29">intersection</a>. The first case happens <a href="if%20and%20only%20if">precisely when</a> , i.e., if the two elements differ by an element of "H". Similar considerations apply to the right cosets of "H". The left and right cosets of "H" may or may not be equal. If they are, i.e., for all "g" in "G", , then "H" is said to be a "<a href="normal%20subgroup">normal subgroup</a>".

In D, the introductory symmetry group, the left cosets "gR" of the subgroup "R" consisting of the rotations are either equal to "R", if "g" is an element of "R" itself, or otherwise equal to (highlighted in green). The subgroup "R" is also normal, because and similarly for any element other than f. (In fact, in the case of D, observe that all such cosets are equal, such that .)

In some situations the set of cosets of a subgroup can be endowed with a group law, giving a "quotient group" or "factor group". For this to be possible, the subgroup has to be <a href="normal%20subgroup">normal</a>. Given any normal subgroup "N", the quotient group is defined by

This set inherits a group operation (sometimes called coset multiplication, or coset addition) from the original group "G": for all "g" and "h" in "G". This definition is motivated by the idea (itself an instance of general structural considerations outlined above) that the map that associates to any element "g" its coset "gN" be a group homomorphism, or by general abstract considerations called <a href="universal%20property">universal properties</a>. The coset serves as the identity in this group, and the inverse of "gN" in the quotient group is .
The elements of the quotient group are "R" itself, which represents the identity, and . The group operation on the quotient is shown at the right. For example, . Both the subgroup as well as the corresponding quotient are abelian, whereas D is not abelian. Building bigger groups by smaller ones, such as D from its subgroup "R" and the quotient is abstracted by a notion called <a href="semidirect%20product">semidirect product</a>.

Quotient groups and subgroups together form a way of describing every group by its "<a href="presentation%20of%20a%20group">presentation</a>": any group is the quotient of the <a href="free%20group">free group</a> over the "<a href="Generating%20set%20of%20a%20group">generators</a>" of the group, quotiented by the subgroup of "relations". The dihedral group D, for example, can be generated by two elements "r" and "f" (for example, "r" = r, the right rotation and "f" = f the vertical (or any other) reflection), which means that every symmetry of the square is a finite composition of these two symmetries or their inverses. Together with the relations
the group is completely described. A presentation of a group can also be used to construct the <a href="Cayley%20graph">Cayley graph</a>, a device used to graphically capture <a href="discrete%20group">discrete group</a>s.

Sub- and quotient groups are related in the following way: a subset "H" of "G" can be seen as an <a href="injective">injective</a> map , i.e., any element of the target has at most one <a href="preimage">element that maps to it</a>. The counterpart to injective maps are <a href="surjective">surjective</a> maps (every element of the target is mapped onto), such as the canonical map . Interpreting subgroup and quotients in light of these homomorphisms emphasizes the structural concept inherent to these definitions alluded to in the introduction. In general, homomorphisms are neither injective nor surjective. <a href="Kernel%20%28algebra%29">Kernel</a> and <a href="Image%20%28mathematics%29">image</a> of group homomorphisms and the <a href="first%20isomorphism%20theorem">first isomorphism theorem</a> address this phenomenon.

Examples and applications of groups abound. A starting point is the group Z of integers with addition as group operation, introduced above. If instead of addition <a href="multiplication">multiplication</a> is considered, one obtains <a href="multiplicative%20group">multiplicative group</a>s. These groups are predecessors of important constructions in <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>.

Groups are also applied in many other mathematical areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by <a href="functor">associating</a> groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, <a href="Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a> founded what is now called <a href="algebraic%20topology">algebraic topology</a> by introducing the <a href="fundamental%20group">fundamental group</a>. By means of this connection, <a href="Glossary%20of%20topology">topological properties</a> such as <a href="Neighbourhood%20%28mathematics%29">proximity</a> and <a href="continuous%20function">continuity</a> translate into properties of groups. For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered <a href="null-homotopic">null-homotopic</a> (and thus irrelevant), because it can be <a href="homotopy">continuously shrunk</a> to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop <a href="winding%20number">winding once</a> around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.

In more recent applications, the influence has also been reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background. In a similar vein, <a href="geometric%20group%20theory">geometric group theory</a> employs geometric concepts, for example in the study of <a href="hyperbolic%20group">hyperbolic group</a>s. Further branches crucially applying groups include <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a> and <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>.

In addition to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. <a href="Cryptography">Cryptography</a> relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>ical knowledge obtained in <a href="computational%20group%20theory">computational group theory</a>, in particular when implemented for finite groups. Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as <a href="physics">physics</a>, <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> benefit from the concept.

Many number systems, such as the integers and the rationals enjoy a naturally given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">rings</a> and <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">fields</a>. Further <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>ic concepts such as <a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">module</a>s, <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a>s and <a href="algebra%20over%20a%20field">algebras</a> also form groups.

The group of integers formula_1 under addition, denoted formula_4, has been described above. The integers, with the operation of <a href="multiplication">multiplication</a> instead of addition, formula_5 do "not" form a group. The closure, associativity and identity axioms are satisfied, but inverses do not exist: for example, is an integer, but the only solution to the equation in this case is , which is a rational number, but not an integer. Hence not every element of formula_1 has a (multiplicative) inverse.

The desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses suggests considering <a href="fraction%20%28mathematics%29">fractions</a>
Fractions of integers (with "b" nonzero) are known as <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s. The set of all such irreducible fractions is commonly denoted formula_8. There is still a minor obstacle for formula_9, the rationals with multiplication, being a group: because the rational number <a href="0%20%28number%29">0</a> does not have a multiplicative inverse (i.e., there is no "x" such that ), formula_9 is still not a group.

However, the set of all "nonzero" rational numbers formula_11 does form an abelian group under multiplication, generally denoted formula_12. Associativity and identity element axioms follow from the properties of integers. The closure requirement still holds true after removing zero, because the product of two nonzero rationals is never zero. Finally, the inverse of "a"/"b" is "b"/"a", therefore the axiom of the inverse element is satisfied.

The rational numbers (including 0) also form a group under addition. Intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">rings</a> and—if division is possible, such as in formula_8—<a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">fields</a>, which occupy a central position in <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>. Group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts of the theory of those entities.

In <a href="modular%20arithmetic">modular arithmetic</a>, two integers are added and then the sum is divided by a positive integer called the "modulus." The result of modular addition is the <a href="remainder">remainder</a> of that division. For any modulus, "n", the set of integers from 0 to forms a group under modular addition: the inverse of any element "a" is , and 0 is the identity element. This is familiar from the addition of hours on the face of a <a href="12-hour%20clock">clock</a>: if the hour hand is on 9 and is advanced 4 hours, it ends up on 1, as shown at the right. This is expressed by saying that 9 + 4 equals 1 "modulo 12" or, in symbols,
The group of integers modulo "n" is written formula_14 or formula_15.

For any <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a> "p", there is also the <a href="multiplicative%20group%20of%20integers%20modulo%20n">multiplicative group of integers modulo "p"</a>. Its elements are the integers 1 to . The group operation is multiplication modulo "p". That is, the usual product is divided by "p" and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication. For example, if , there are four group elements 1, 2, 3, 4. In this group, , because the usual product 16 is equivalent to 1, which divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1. for 5 divides , denoted
The primality of "p" ensures that the product of two integers neither of which is divisible by "p" is not divisible by "p" either, hence the indicated set of classes is closed under multiplication. The identity element is 1, as usual for a multiplicative group, and the associativity follows from the corresponding property of integers. Finally, the inverse element axiom requires that given an integer "a" not divisible by "p", there exists an integer "b" such that
The inverse "b" can be found by using <a href="B%C3%A9zout%27s%20identity">Bézout's identity</a> and the fact that the <a href="greatest%20common%20divisor">greatest common divisor</a> equals 1. In the case above, the inverse of 4 is 4, and the inverse of 3 is 2, as . Hence all group axioms are fulfilled. Actually, this example is similar to formula_16 above: it consists of exactly those elements in formula_17 that have a multiplicative inverse. These groups are denoted F. They are crucial to <a href="public-key%20cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>.

A "cyclic group" is a group all of whose elements are <a href="power%20%28mathematics%29">powers</a> of a particular element "a". In multiplicative notation, the elements of the group are:
where "a" means "a" • "a", and "a" stands for "a" • "a" • "a" = ("a" • "a" • "a") etc. Such an element "a" is called a generator or a <a href="Primitive%20root%20modulo%20n">primitive element</a> of the group. In additive notation, the requirement for an element to be primitive is that each element of the group can be written as

In the groups Z/"n"Z introduced above, the element 1 is primitive, so these groups are cyclic. Indeed, each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are 1. Any cyclic group with "n" elements is isomorphic to this group. A second example for cyclic groups is the group of <a href="root%20of%20unity">"n"-th complex roots of unity</a>, given by <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s "z" satisfying . These numbers can be visualized as the vertices on a regular "n"-gon, as shown in blue at the right for . The group operation is multiplication of complex numbers. In the picture, multiplying with "z" corresponds to a <a href="clockwise">counter-clockwise</a> rotation by 60°. Using some <a href="field%20theory%20%28mathematics%29">field theory</a>, the group F can be shown to be cyclic: for example, if , 3 is a generator since , , , and .

Some cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements. In these groups, for every non-zero element "a", all the powers of "a" are distinct; despite the name "cyclic group", the powers of the elements do not cycle. An infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to , the group of integers under addition introduced above. As these two prototypes are both abelian, so is any cyclic group.

The study of finitely generated abelian groups is quite mature, including the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20finitely%20generated%20abelian%20groups">fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups</a>; and reflecting this state of affairs, many group-related notions, such as <a href="Center%20%28group%20theory%29">center</a> and <a href="commutator">commutator</a>, describe the extent to which a given group is not abelian.

"Symmetry groups" are groups consisting of <a href="symmetry">symmetries</a> of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, such as the introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as <a href="polynomial%20equation">polynomial equation</a>s and their solutions. Conceptually, group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry. <a href="Symmetry%20in%20mathematics">Symmetries in mathematics</a> greatly simplify the study of <a href="geometry">geometrical</a> or <a href="analysis">analytical objects</a>. A group is said to <a href="Group%20action%20%28mathematics%29">act</a> on another mathematical object "X" if every group element performs some operation on "X" compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the <a href="%282%2C3%2C7%29%20triangle%20group">(2,3,7) triangle group</a> acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.
In chemical fields, such as <a href="crystallography">crystallography</a>, <a href="space%20group">space group</a>s and <a href="point%20group">point group</a>s describe <a href="molecular%20symmetry">molecular symmetries</a> and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> analysis of these properties. For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because of the symmetry of the states involved.

Not only are groups useful to assess the implications of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry. The <a href="Jahn-Teller%20effect">Jahn-Teller effect</a> is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states that are related to each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.

Likewise, group theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a <a href="phase%20transition">phase transition</a>, for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is <a href="ferroelectric">ferroelectric</a> materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the <a href="Curie%20temperature">Curie temperature</a> and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft <a href="phonon">phonon</a> mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.

Such <a href="spontaneous%20symmetry%20breaking">spontaneous symmetry breaking</a> has found further application in elementary particle physics, where its occurrence is related to the appearance of <a href="Goldstone%20boson">Goldstone boson</a>s.

Finite symmetry groups such as the <a href="Mathieu%20group">Mathieu group</a>s are used in <a href="coding%20theory">coding theory</a>, which is in turn applied in <a href="forward%20error%20correction">error correction</a> of transmitted data, and in <a href="CD%20player">CD player</a>s. Another application is <a href="differential%20Galois%20theory">differential Galois theory</a>, which characterizes functions having <a href="antiderivative">antiderivative</a>s of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain <a href="differential%20equation">differential equation</a>s are well-behaved. Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in <a href="geometric%20invariant%20theory">(geometric)</a> <a href="invariant%20theory">invariant theory</a>.

<a href="Matrix%20group">Matrix group</a>s consist of <a href="Matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrices</a> together with <a href="matrix%20multiplication">matrix multiplication</a>. The "general linear group" consists of all <a href="invertible%20matrix">invertible</a> "n"-by-"n" matrices with <a href="real%20number">real</a> entries. Its subgroups are referred to as "matrix groups" or "<a href="linear%20group">linear group</a>s". The dihedral group example mentioned above can be viewed as a (very small) matrix group. Another important matrix group is the <a href="special%20orthogonal%20group">special orthogonal group</a> SO("n"). It describes all possible rotations in "n" dimensions. Via <a href="Euler%20angles">Euler angles</a>, <a href="Rotation%20matrix">rotation matrices</a> are used in <a href="computer%20graphics">computer graphics</a>.

"Representation theory" is both an application of the group concept and important for a deeper understanding of groups. It studies the group by its <a href="Group%20action%20%28mathematics%29">group action</a>s on other spaces. A broad class of <a href="group%20representation">group representation</a>s are linear representations, i.e., the group is acting on a <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a>, such as the three-dimensional <a href="Euclidean%20space">Euclidean space</a> R. A representation of "G" on an "n"-<a href="dimension">dimension</a>al real vector space is simply a group homomorphism
from the group to the general linear group. This way, the group operation, which may be abstractly given, translates to the multiplication of matrices making it accessible to explicit computations.

Given a group action, this gives further means to study the object being acted on. On the other hand, it also yields information about the group. Group representations are an organizing principle in the theory of finite groups, Lie groups, <a href="algebraic%20group">algebraic group</a>s and <a href="topological%20group">topological group</a>s, especially (locally) <a href="compact%20group">compact group</a>s.

"Galois groups" were developed to help solve <a href="polynomial%20equation">polynomial equation</a>s by capturing their symmetry features. For example, the solutions of the <a href="quadratic%20equation">quadratic equation</a> are given by
Exchanging "+" and "−" in the expression, i.e., permuting the two solutions of the equation can be viewed as a (very simple) group operation. Similar formulae are known for <a href="cubic%20equation">cubic</a> and <a href="quartic%20equation">quartic equation</a>s, but do "not" exist in general for <a href="quintic%20equation">degree 5</a> and higher. Abstract properties of Galois groups associated with polynomials (in particular their <a href="solvable%20group">solvability</a>) give a criterion for polynomials that have all their solutions expressible by radicals, i.e., solutions expressible using solely addition, multiplication, and <a href="Nth%20root">roots</a> similar to the formula above.

The problem can be dealt with by shifting to <a href="field%20theory%20%28mathematics%29">field theory</a> and considering the <a href="splitting%20field">splitting field</a> of a polynomial. Modern <a href="Galois%20theory">Galois theory</a> generalizes the above type of Galois groups to <a href="field%20extension">field extension</a>s and establishes—via the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20Galois%20theory">fundamental theorem of Galois theory</a>—a precise relationship between fields and groups, underlining once again the ubiquity of groups in mathematics.

A group is called "finite" if it has a <a href="finite%20set">finite number of elements</a>. The number of elements is called the <a href="order%20%28group%20theory%29">order</a> of the group. An important class is the "<a href="symmetric%20group">symmetric group</a>s" S, the groups of <a href="permutation">permutation</a>s of "N" letters. For example, the symmetric group on 3 letters <a href="dihedral%20group%20of%20order%206">S</a> is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters "ABC", i.e., contains the elements "ABC", "ACB", "BAC", "BCA", "CAB", "CBA", in total 6 (<a href="factorial">factorial</a> of 3) elements. This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group S for a suitable integer "N", according to <a href="Cayley%27s%20theorem">Cayley's theorem</a>. Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above, S can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an <a href="equilateral%20triangle">equilateral triangle</a>.

The order of an element "a" in a group "G" is the least positive integer "n" such that "a" = "e", where "a" represents

i.e., application of the operation • to "n" copies of "a". (If • represents multiplication, then "a" corresponds to the "n"th power of "a".) In infinite groups, such an "n" may not exist, in which case the order of "a" is said to be infinity. The order of an element equals the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by this element.

More sophisticated counting techniques, for example counting cosets, yield more precise statements about finite groups: <a href="Lagrange%27s%20theorem%20%28group%20theory%29">Lagrange's Theorem</a> states that for a finite group "G" the order of any finite subgroup "H" <a href="divisor">divides</a> the order of "G". The <a href="Sylow%20theorems">Sylow theorems</a> give a partial converse.

The <a href="dihedral%20group">dihedral group</a> (discussed above) is a finite group of order 8. The order of r is 4, as is the order of the subgroup "R" it generates (see above). The order of the reflection elements f etc. is 2. Both orders divide 8, as predicted by Lagrange's theorem. The groups F above have order .

Mathematicians often strive for a complete <a href="classification%20theorems">classification</a> (or list) of a mathematical notion. In the context of finite groups, this aim leads to difficult mathematics. According to Lagrange's theorem, finite groups of order "p", a prime number, are necessarily cyclic (abelian) groups Z. Groups of order "p" can also be shown to be abelian, a statement which does not generalize to order "p", as the non-abelian group D of order 8 = 2 above shows. <a href="Computer%20algebra%20system">Computer algebra system</a>s can be used to <a href="List%20of%20small%20groups">list small groups</a>, but there is no classification of all finite groups. An intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups. A nontrivial group is called "<a href="simple%20group">simple</a>" if its only normal subgroups are the <a href="trivial%20group">trivial group</a> and the group itself. The <a href="Jordan%E2%80%93H%C3%B6lder%20theorem">Jordan–Hölder theorem</a> exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups. <a href="List%20of%20finite%20simple%20groups">Listing all finite simple groups</a> was a major achievement in contemporary group theory. 1998 <a href="Fields%20Medal">Fields Medal</a> winner <a href="Richard%20Borcherds">Richard Borcherds</a> succeeded in proving the <a href="monstrous%20moonshine">monstrous moonshine</a> conjectures, a surprising and deep relation between the largest finite simple <a href="sporadic%20group">sporadic group</a>—the "<a href="monster%20group">monster group</a>"—and certain <a href="modular%20function">modular function</a>s, a piece of classical <a href="complex%20analysis">complex analysis</a>, and <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a>, a theory supposed to unify the description of many physical phenomena.

Many groups are simultaneously groups and examples of other mathematical structures. In the language of <a href="category%20theory">category theory</a>, they are <a href="group%20object">group object</a>s in a <a href="category%20%28mathematics%29">category</a>, meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called <a href="morphism">morphism</a>s) that mimic the group axioms. For example, every group (as defined above) is also a set, so a group is a group object in the <a href="category%20of%20sets">category of sets</a>.

Some <a href="topological%20space">topological space</a>s may be endowed with a group law. In order for the group law and the topology to interweave well, the group operations must be <a href="continuous%20function">continuous function</a>s, that is, , and "g" must not vary wildly if "g" and "h" vary only little. Such groups are called "topological groups," and they are the group objects in the <a href="category%20of%20topological%20spaces">category of topological spaces</a>. The most basic examples are the <a href="real%20number">reals</a> R under addition, , and similarly with any other <a href="topological%20field">topological field</a> such as the <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s or <a href="p-adic%20number">"p"-adic numbers</a>. All of these groups are <a href="locally%20compact%20topological%20group">locally compact</a>, so they have <a href="Haar%20measure">Haar measure</a>s and can be studied via <a href="harmonic%20analysis">harmonic analysis</a>. The former offer an abstract formalism of invariant <a href="integral">integral</a>s. <a href="Invariant%20%28mathematics%29">Invariance</a> means, in the case of real numbers for example:
for any constant "c". Matrix groups over these fields fall under this regime, as do <a href="adele%20ring">adele ring</a>s and <a href="adelic%20algebraic%20group">adelic algebraic group</a>s, which are basic to number theory. Galois groups of infinite field extensions such as the <a href="absolute%20Galois%20group">absolute Galois group</a> can also be equipped with a topology, the so-called <a href="Krull%20topology">Krull topology</a>, which in turn is central to generalize the above sketched connection of fields and groups to infinite field extensions. An advanced generalization of this idea, adapted to the needs of <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a>, is the <a href="%C3%A9tale%20fundamental%20group">étale fundamental group</a>.

"Lie groups" (in honor of <a href="Sophus%20Lie">Sophus Lie</a>) are groups which also have a <a href="manifold">manifold</a> structure, i.e., they are spaces <a href="diffeomorphism">looking locally like</a> some <a href="Euclidean%20space">Euclidean space</a> of the appropriate <a href="dimension">dimension</a>. Again, the additional structure, here the manifold structure, has to be compatible, i.e., the maps corresponding to multiplication and the inverse have to be <a href="smooth%20map">smooth</a>.

A standard example is the general linear group introduced above: it is an <a href="open%20subset">open subset</a> of the space of all "n"-by-"n" matrices, because it is given by the inequality
where "A" denotes an "n"-by-"n" matrix.

Lie groups are of fundamental importance in modern physics: <a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a> links continuous symmetries to <a href="conserved%20quantities">conserved quantities</a>. <a href="Rotation">Rotation</a>, as well as <a href="translation%20%28geometry%29">translations</a> in <a href="space">space</a> and <a href="time">time</a> are basic symmetries of the laws of <a href="mechanics">mechanics</a>. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example are the <a href="Lorentz%20transformation">Lorentz transformation</a>s, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of <a href="Minkowski%20space">Minkowski space</a>. The latter serves—in the absence of significant <a href="gravitation">gravitation</a>—as a model of <a href="space%20time">space time</a> in <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a>. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the <a href="Poincar%C3%A9%20group">Poincaré group</a>. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for <a href="quantum%20field%20theories">quantum field theories</a>. <a href="Local%20symmetry">Symmetries that vary with location</a> are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of <a href="gauge%20theory">gauge theory</a>.

In <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, more general structures are defined by relaxing some of the axioms defining a group. For example, if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated, the resulting algebraic structure is called a <a href="monoid">monoid</a>. The <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s N (including 0) under addition form a monoid, as do the nonzero integers under multiplication , see above. There is a general method to formally add inverses to elements to any (abelian) monoid, much the same way as is derived from , known as the <a href="Grothendieck%20group">Grothendieck group</a>.
<a href="Groupoid">Groupoid</a>s are similar to groups except that the composition need not be defined for all "a" and "b". They arise in the study of more complicated forms of symmetry, often in <a href="topology">topological</a> and <a href="mathematical%20analysis">analytical</a> structures, such as the <a href="fundamental%20groupoid">fundamental groupoid</a> or <a href="stack%20%28mathematics%29">stacks</a>. Finally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an arbitrary <a href="arity">"n"-ary</a> one (i.e., an operation taking "n" arguments). With the proper generalization of the group axioms this gives rise to an <a href="n-ary%20group">"n"-ary group</a>. The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups.

Minnesota

Minnesota () is a <a href="U.S.%20state">state</a> in the <a href="Upper%20Midwest">Upper Midwest</a> and <a href="Northern%20United%20States">northern</a> regions of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the <a href="Minnesota%20Territory">Minnesota Territory</a>. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan the "Land of 10,000 Lakes". Its official motto is "L'Étoile du Nord" (<a href="French%20language">French</a>: "Star of the North").

Minnesota is the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20area">12th largest in area</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20population">22nd most populous</a> of the U.S. states; nearly 60% of its residents live in the <a href="Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint%20Paul">Minneapolis–Saint Paul</a> metropolitan area (known as the "Twin Cities"). This area is the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government, while being home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western <a href="prairie">prairie</a>s now given over to intensive agriculture; <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed, and settled; and the less populated <a href="Laurentian%20Mixed%20Forest%20Province">North Woods</a>, used for mining, forestry, and recreation.

Minnesota was inhabited by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years prior to the arrival of Europeans. French explorers, missionaries, and fur traders began exploring the region in the 17th century, encountering the <a href="Dakota%20people">Dakota</a> and <a href="Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a>/<a href="Anishinaabe">Anishinaabe</a> tribes. Much of what is today Minnesota was part of the <a href="Louisiana%20Territory">vast French holding of Louisiana</a>, which was <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">purchased by the United States</a> in 1803. Following several territorial reorganizations, Minnesota in its current form was admitted as the country's 32nd state on May 11, 1858. Like many Midwestern states, it remained sparsely populated and centered on lumber and agriculture. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a large number of European immigrants, mainly from <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, began to settle the state, which remains a center of <a href="Scandinavian%20American">Scandinavian American</a> and <a href="German%20American">German American</a> culture.

In recent decades, immigration from <a href="Asian%20American">Asia</a>, the <a href="Horn%20of%20Africa">Horn of Africa</a>, the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, and <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Latin America</a> has broadened its demographic and cultural composition. The state's economy has heavily diversified, shifting from traditional activities such as agriculture and resource extraction to services and finance. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.

The word "Minnesota" comes from the <a href="Dakota%20language">Dakota</a> name for the <a href="Minnesota%20River">Minnesota River</a>: The river got its name from one of two words in the <a href="Dakota%20language">Dakota language</a>, 'Mní sóta' which means "clear blue water", or 'Mnißota', which means cloudy water. <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> demonstrated the name to early settlers by dropping milk into water and calling it "mnisota". Many places in the state have similar names, such as <a href="Minnehaha%20Falls">Minnehaha Falls</a> ("curling water" or waterfall), <a href="Minneiska%2C%20Minnesota">Minneiska</a> ("white water"), <a href="Minneota%2C%20Minnesota">Minneota</a> ("much water"), <a href="Lake%20Minnetonka">Minnetonka</a> ("big water"), <a href="Minnetrista%2C%20Minnesota">Minnetrista</a> ("crooked water"), and Minneapolis, a combination of "mni" and "polis", the Greek word for "city".

Minnesota is the second northernmost U.S. state (after <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>) and northernmost contiguous state. Its isolated <a href="Northwest%20Angle">Northwest Angle</a> in <a href="Lake%20of%20the%20Woods">Lake of the Woods</a> county is the only part of the 48 <a href="Contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous states</a> lying north of the <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49th parallel</a>. The state is part of the U.S. region known as the <a href="Upper%20Midwest">Upper Midwest</a> and part of North America's <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region%20%28North%20America%29">Great Lakes Region</a>. It shares a <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a> water border with <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> and a land and water border with <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> to the east. <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> is to the south, <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> and <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a> are to the west, and the <a href="Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">Canadian provinces</a> of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> and <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> are to the north. With , or approximately 2.25% of the United States, Minnesota is the 12th-largest state.

Minnesota has some of the earth's oldest rocks, <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a>es that are about 3.6 billion years old (80% as old as the planet). About 2.7 billion years ago, <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic <a href="lava">lava</a> poured out of cracks in the floor of the primordial <a href="ocean">ocean</a>; the remains of this <a href="volcano">volcanic</a> rock formed the <a href="Canadian%20Shield">Canadian Shield</a> in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> seas formed the <a href="Iron%20Range">Iron Range</a> of northern Minnesota. Following a period of <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a> 1.1 billion years ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>.

In <a href="Glacial%20history%20of%20Minnesota">more recent times</a>, massive ice sheets at least one kilometer thick ravaged the state's landscape and sculpted its terrain. The <a href="Wisconsin%20glaciation">Wisconsin glaciation</a> left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a>. This area is known as the <a href="Coulee%20Region">Driftless Zone</a> for its absence of glacial drift. Much of the remainder of the state outside the northeast has 50 feet (15 m) or more of <a href="glacial%20till">glacial till</a> left behind as the last glaciers retreated. Gigantic <a href="Lake%20Agassiz">Lake Agassiz</a> formed in the northwest 13,000 years ago. Its bed created the fertile <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20North">Red River</a> valley, and its outflow, <a href="glacial%20River%20Warren">glacial River Warren</a>, carved the valley of the <a href="Minnesota%20River">Minnesota River</a> and the Upper Mississippi downstream from <a href="Fort%20Snelling">Fort Snelling</a>. Minnesota is geologically quiet today; it experiences <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s infrequently, and most of them are minor.
The state's high point is <a href="Eagle%20Mountain%20%28Minnesota%29">Eagle Mountain</a> at 2,301 feet (701 m), which is only away from the low of 601 feet (183 m) at the shore of Lake Superior. Notwithstanding dramatic local differences in elevation, much of the state is a gently rolling <a href="peneplain">peneplain</a>.

Two major <a href="drainage%20divide">drainage divide</a>s meet in Minnesota's northeast in rural <a href="Hibbing%2C%20Minnesota">Hibbing</a>, forming a triple <a href="Drainage%20basin">watershed</a>. <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">Precipitation</a> can follow the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> south to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, the <a href="Saint%20Lawrence%20Seaway">Saint Lawrence Seaway</a> east to the Atlantic Ocean, or the <a href="Canada%20Hudson%20Bay%20drainage">Hudson Bay watershed</a> to the Arctic Ocean.

The state's nickname, "Land of 10,000 Lakes", is apt, as there are 11,842 <a href="Minnesota%20lakes">Minnesota lakes</a> over in size. Minnesota's portion of Lake Superior is the largest at and deepest (at ) body of water in the state. Minnesota has 6,564 natural rivers and streams that cumulatively flow for . The Mississippi River begins its journey from its <a href="headwaters">headwaters</a> at <a href="Lake%20Itasca">Lake Itasca</a> and crosses the Iowa border downstream. It is joined by the <a href="Minnesota%20River">Minnesota River</a> at Fort Snelling, by the <a href="St.%20Croix%20River%20%28Wisconsin-Minnesota%29">St. Croix River</a> near <a href="Hastings%2C%20Minnesota">Hastings</a>, by the <a href="Chippewa%20River%20%28Wisconsin%29">Chippewa River</a> at <a href="Wabasha%2C%20MN">Wabasha</a>, and by many smaller streams. The <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20North">Red River</a>, in the bed of glacial Lake Agassiz, drains the northwest part of the state northward toward Canada's Hudson Bay. Approximately of wetlands are within Minnesota's borders, the most of any state except Alaska.

Minnesota has four ecological provinces: <a href="prairie">Prairie Parkland</a>, in the southwestern and western parts of the state; the <a href="Temperate%20deciduous%20forest">Eastern Broadleaf Forest</a> (<a href="Big%20Woods">Big Woods</a>) in the southeast, extending in a narrowing strip to the state's northwestern part, where it transitions into <a href="Tallgrass%20Aspen%20Parkland">Tallgrass Aspen Parkland</a>; and the northern <a href="Laurentian%20Mixed%20Forest%20Province">Laurentian Mixed Forest</a>, a transitional forest between the northern <a href="Taiga">boreal forest</a> and the broadleaf forests to the south. These northern forests are a vast wilderness of <a href="pine">pine</a> and <a href="spruce">spruce</a> trees mixed with patchy stands of <a href="birch">birch</a> and <a href="Populus">poplar</a>.

Much of Minnesota's northern forest underwent logging at some time, leaving only a few patches of <a href="old%20growth%20forest">old growth forest</a> today in areas such as in the <a href="Chippewa%20National%20Forest">Chippewa National Forest</a> and the <a href="Superior%20National%20Forest">Superior National Forest</a>, where the <a href="Boundary%20Waters%20Canoe%20Area%20Wilderness">Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness</a> has some of unlogged land. Although logging continues, regrowth and replanting keep about one third of the state forested. Nearly all of Minnesota's prairies and <a href="oak%20savanna">oak savanna</a>s have been fragmented by farming, grazing, logging, and suburban development.

While loss of habitat has affected native animals such as the <a href="American%20marten">pine marten</a>, <a href="elk">elk</a>, <a href="Migratory%20Woodland%20Caribou">woodland caribou</a>, and <a href="American%20bison">bison</a>, others like <a href="whitetail%20deer">whitetail deer</a> and <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a> thrive. The state has the nation's largest population of <a href="wolf">timber wolves</a> outside Alaska, and supports healthy populations of <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bears</a>, <a href="moose">moose</a>, and <a href="gopher">gopher</a>s. Located on the <a href="Mississippi%20Flyway">Mississippi Flyway</a>, Minnesota hosts migratory waterfowl such as <a href="Goose">geese</a> and <a href="duck">duck</a>s, and game birds such as <a href="grouse">grouse</a>, <a href="pheasant">pheasant</a>s, and <a href="Turkey%20%28bird%29">turkeys</a>. It is home to <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, including the largest number of breeding pairs of <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>s in the lower 48 states, as of 2007, <a href="red-tailed%20Hawk">red-tailed hawks</a>, and <a href="snowy%20owl">snowy owl</a>s. The lakes teem with sport fish such as <a href="walleye">walleye</a>, <a href="bass%20%28fish%29">bass</a>, <a href="muskellunge">muskellunge</a>, and <a href="northern%20pike">northern pike</a>, and streams in the southeast and northeast are populated by <a href="brook%20trout">brook</a>, <a href="brown%20trout">brown</a>, and <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a>.

Minnesota experiences <a href="List%20of%20Minnesota%20weather%20records">temperature extremes</a> characteristic of its <a href="continental%20climate">continental climate</a>, with cold winters and hot summers. The lowest temperature recorded was at <a href="Tower%2C%20Minnesota">Tower</a> on February 2, 1996, whereas the highest was at <a href="Moorhead%2C%20Minnesota">Moorhead</a> on July 6, 1936. Meteorological events include <a href="rain">rain</a>, snow, blizzards, thunderstorms, hail, <a href="derecho">derecho</a>s, <a href="tornado">tornado</a>es, and high-velocity <a href="Downburst">straight-line winds</a>. The growing season varies from 90 days per year in the <a href="Iron%20Range">Iron Range</a> to 160 days in southeast Minnesota near the Mississippi River, and average temperatures range from . Average summer <a href="dew%20point">dew point</a>s range from about in the south to about in the north. Average annual precipitation ranges from , and droughts occur every 10 to 50 years.

Minnesota's first state park, <a href="Itasca%20State%20Park">Itasca State Park</a>, was established in 1891, and is the <a href="source%20%28river%20or%20stream%29">source</a> of the Mississippi River. Today, Minnesota has <a href="List%20of%20Minnesota%20state%20parks">72 state parks</a> and recreation areas, <a href="List%20of%20Minnesota%20state%20forests">58 state forests</a> covering about four million acres (16,000 km²), and numerous state wildlife preserves, all managed by the <a href="Minnesota%20Department%20of%20Natural%20Resources">Minnesota Department of Natural Resources</a>. There are in the <a href="Chippewa%20National%20Forest">Chippewa</a> and <a href="Superior%20National%20Forest">Superior national forests</a>. The Superior National Forest in the northeast contains the <a href="Boundary%20Waters%20Canoe%20Area%20Wilderness">Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness</a>, which encompasses over a million acres (4,000 km²) and a thousand lakes. To its west is <a href="Voyageurs%20National%20Park">Voyageurs National Park</a>. The <a href="Mississippi%20National%20River%20and%20Recreation%20Area">Mississippi National River and Recreation Area</a> (MNRRA), is a corridor along the Mississippi River through the Minneapolis–St. Paul Metropolitan Area connecting a variety of sites of historic, cultural, and geologic interest.

Before European settlement of North America, Minnesota was populated by a subculture of <a href="Sioux">Sioux</a> called the <a href="Dakota%20people">Dakota people</a>. As Europeans settled the east coast, Native Americans moved away from them causing migration of the <a href="Anishinaabe">Anishinaabe</a> (also known as <a href="Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a>) and other Native Americans into the Minnesota area. The first Europeans in the area were French <a href="voyageurs">voyageur</a> <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>rs who arrived in the 17th century and began using the <a href="Grand%20Portage%20National%20Monument">Grand Portage</a> to access trapping and trading areas further inland. Late that century, Anishinaabe migrated westward to Minnesota, causing tensions with the <a href="Dakota%20people">Dakota people</a>. Explorers such as <a href="Daniel%20Greysolon%2C%20Sieur%20du%20Lhut">Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut</a>, Father <a href="Louis%20Hennepin">Louis Hennepin</a>, <a href="Jonathan%20Carver">Jonathan Carver</a>, <a href="Henry%20Schoolcraft">Henry Schoolcraft</a>, and <a href="Joseph%20Nicollet">Joseph Nicollet</a> mapped out the state.

In 1762 the region became part of <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20Spain%29">Spanish Louisiana</a> until 1802. The portion of the state east of the Mississippi River became part of the United States at the end of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, when the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Second Treaty of Paris</a> was signed. Land west of the Mississippi River was acquired with the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a>, although a portion of the <a href="Red%20River%20Valley">Red River Valley</a> was disputed until the <a href="Treaty%20of%201818">Treaty of 1818</a>. By the late 1700s, the <a href="North%20West%20Company">North West Company</a> had established the post of Fort Charlotte at the Lake Superior end of the Grand Portage, until moving 50 miles northeast to <a href="Fort%20William%2C%20Ontario">Fort William</a> in 1803. In 1805, <a href="Zebulon%20Pike">Zebulon Pike</a> bargained with Native Americans to acquire land at the <a href="confluence">confluence</a> of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers. The construction of Fort Snelling followed between 1819 and 1825. Its soldiers built a <a href="grist%20mill">grist mill</a> and a <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a> at <a href="Saint%20Anthony%20Falls">Saint Anthony Falls</a>, the first of the water-powered industries around which the city of Minneapolis later grew. Meanwhile, squatters, government officials, and tourists had settled near the fort. In 1839, the army forced them to move downriver and they settled in the area that became St. Paul. <a href="Minnesota%20Territory">Minnesota Territory</a> was formed on March 3, 1849. The first territorial legislature (held September 2, 1849) was dominated by men from New England or of New England ancestry. Thousands of people had come to build farms and cut timber, and Minnesota became the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20by%20date%20of%20admission%20to%20the%20Union">32nd U.S. state</a> on May 11, 1858. The founding population was so overwhelmingly of New England origins that the state was dubbed "the New England of the West".
Treaties between European settlers and the Dakota and Ojibwe gradually forced the natives off their lands and on to smaller reservations. In 1861, residents of <a href="Mankato%2C%20Minnesota">Mankato</a> formed the <a href="Knights%20of%20the%20Forest">Knights of the Forest</a>, with a goal of eliminating all <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indians</a> from Minnesota. As conditions deteriorated for the Dakota, tensions rose, leading to the <a href="Dakota%20War%20of%201862">Dakota War of 1862</a>. The result of the six-week war was the execution of 38 Dakota and the exile of most of the rest of the Dakota to the <a href="Crow%20Creek%20Reservation">Crow Creek Reservation</a> in <a href="Dakota%20Territory">Dakota Territory</a>. As many as 800 white settlers died during the war.

Logging and farming were mainstays of Minnesota's early economy. The sawmills at Saint Anthony Falls, and logging centers like <a href="Pine%20City%2C%20Minnesota">Pine City</a>, <a href="Marine%20on%20St.%20Croix%2C%20Minnesota">Marine on St. Croix</a>, <a href="Stillwater%2C%20Minnesota">Stillwater</a>, and <a href="Winona%2C%20Minnesota">Winona</a>, processed high volumes of lumber. These cities were situated on rivers that were ideal for transportation. Later, Saint Anthony Falls was tapped to provide power for <a href="Gristmill">flour mills</a>. Innovations by Minneapolis millers led to the production of Minnesota "patent" flour, which commanded almost double the price of "bakers'" or "clear" flour, which it replaced. By 1900, Minnesota mills, led by <a href="Pillsbury%20Company">Pillsbury</a>, <a href="Northwestern%20Consolidated%20Milling%20Company">Northwestern</a> and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of <a href="General%20Mills">General Mills</a>), were grinding 14.1 percent of the nation's grain.
The state's iron-mining industry was established with the discovery of iron in the <a href="Vermilion%20Range%20%28Minnesota%29">Vermilion Range</a> and the <a href="Mesabi%20Range">Mesabi Range</a> in the 1880s, and in the <a href="Cuyuna%20Range">Cuyuna Range</a> in the early 20th century. The ore was shipped by rail to <a href="Duluth%2C%20Minnesota">Duluth</a> and <a href="Two%20Harbors%2C%20Minnesota">Two Harbors</a>, then loaded onto ships and transported eastward over the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>.

Industrial development and the rise of manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hard-hit by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> programs provided some economic turnaround. The <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the <a href="Indian%20Reorganization%20Act">Indian Reorganization Act</a> of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This provided natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and <a href="native%20language">native language</a>s were no longer suppressed.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, industrial development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of <a href="feedlot">feedlot</a>s for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a> of corn and wheat, and the use of farm machinery such as <a href="tractor">tractor</a>s and <a href="combine%20harvester">combines</a> became the norm. <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a> professor <a href="Norman%20Borlaug">Norman Borlaug</a> contributed to these developments as part of the <a href="Green%20Revolution">Green Revolution</a>. <a href="Suburb">Suburb</a>an development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.

Minnesota became a center of technology after World War II. <a href="Engineering%20Research%20Associates">Engineering Research Associates</a> was formed in 1946 to develop computers for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. It later merged with <a href="Remington%20Rand">Remington Rand</a>, and then became <a href="Sperry%20Rand">Sperry Rand</a>. <a href="William%20Norris%20%28CEO%29">William Norris</a> left Sperry in 1957 to form <a href="Control%20Data%20Corporation">Control Data Corporation</a> (CDC). <a href="Cray">Cray Research</a> was formed when <a href="Seymour%20Cray">Seymour Cray</a> left CDC to form his own company. Medical device maker <a href="Medtronic">Medtronic</a> also started business in the Twin Cities in 1949.

<a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul</a>, in east-central Minnesota along the banks of the Mississippi River, has been Minnesota's <a href="List%20of%20capitals%20in%20the%20United%20States">capital city</a> since 1849, first as capital of the <a href="Territory%20of%20Minnesota">Territory of Minnesota</a>, and then as the state capital since 1858.

Saint Paul is adjacent to Minnesota's most populous city, Minneapolis; they and their suburbs are known collectively as the <a href="Minneapolis%E2%80%93Saint%20Paul%23Combined%20Statistical%20Area">Twin Cities metropolitan area</a>, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, and home to about 54 percent of the state's population. The remainder of the state is known as "<a href="Regions%20of%20Minnesota">Greater Minnesota</a>" or <a href="pejoratively">pejoratively</a> "Outstate Minnesota".

The state has 17 cities with populations above 50,000 (as of the 2010 census). In descending order of population, they are <a href="Minneapolis%2C%20Minnesota">Minneapolis</a>, <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul</a>, <a href="Rochester%2C%20Minnesota">Rochester</a>, <a href="Duluth%2C%20Minnesota">Duluth</a>, <a href="Bloomington%2C%20Minnesota">Bloomington</a>, <a href="Brooklyn%20Park%2C%20Minnesota">Brooklyn Park</a>, <a href="Plymouth%2C%20Minnesota">Plymouth</a>, <a href="St.%20Cloud%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Cloud</a>, <a href="Woodbury%2C%20Minnesota">Woodbury</a>, <a href="Eagan%2C%20Minnesota">Eagan</a>, <a href="Maple%20Grove%2C%20Minnesota">Maple Grove</a>, <a href="Coon%20Rapids%2C%20Minnesota">Coon Rapids</a>, <a href="Eden%20Prairie%2C%20Minnesota">Eden Prairie</a>, <a href="Minnetonka%2C%20MN">Minnetonka</a>, <a href="Burnsville%2C%20Minnesota">Burnsville</a>, <a href="Apple%20Valley%2C%20Minnesota">Apple Valley</a>, <a href="Blaine%2C%20Minnesota">Blaine</a>, and <a href="Lakeville%2C%20Minnesota">Lakeville</a>.

Minnesota's population continues to grow, primarily in the urban centers. The populations of metropolitan <a href="Sherburne%20County%2C%20Minnesota">Sherburne</a> and <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Minnesota">Scott</a> counties doubled between 1980 and 2000, while 40 of the state's 87 counties lost residents over the same period.

From fewer than 6,120 white settlers in 1850, Minnesota's official population grew to over 1.7 million by 1900. Each of the next six decades saw a 15 percent increase in population, reaching 3.4 million in 1960. Growth then slowed, rising 11 percent to 3.8 million in 1970, and an average of 9 percent over the next three decades to 4.9 million in the <a href="2000%20United%20States%20Census">2000 Census</a>.

The <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a> estimates the population of Minnesota was 5,611,179 on July 1, 2018, a 5.79 percent increase since the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 United States Census</a>. The rate of population change, and age and gender distributions, approximate the national average. Minnesota's <a href="center%20of%20population">center of population</a> is in <a href="Hennepin%20County%2C%20Minnesota">Hennepin County</a>.

As of the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 Census</a>, the population of Minnesota was 5,303,925. The gender makeup of the state was 49.6% male and 50.4% female. 24.2% of the population were under the age of 18; 9.5% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.3% were from 25 to 44; 27.1% were from 45 to 64; and 12.9% were 65 years of age or older.

In 2011, non-Hispanic whites were involved in 72.3 percent of all the births. Minnesota's growing <a href="Race%20and%20ethnicity%20in%20the%20United%20States">minority groups</a>, however, still form a smaller percentage of the population than in the nation as a whole.

Minnesota has America's largest <a href="Somalis">Somali</a> population, with an estimated 57,000 people, the largest concentration outside of the <a href="Horn%20of%20Africa">Horn of Africa</a>.

The majority of Minnesotans are <a href="Protestants">Protestants</a>, including a <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> contingent, owing to the state's largely <a href="Northern%20European">Northern European</a> ethnic makeup. <a href="Roman%20Catholics">Roman Catholics</a> (of largely <a href="German%20Americans">German</a>, <a href="Irish%20Americans">Irish</a>, <a href="French%20Americans">French</a> and <a href="Slavs">Slavic</a> descent) make up the largest single <a href="Christian%20denomination">Christian denomination</a>.

This is broadly consistent with the results of the 2001 <a href="American%20Religious%20Identification%20Survey">American Religious Identification Survey</a>, which also gives detailed percentages for many individual denominations. Although <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> is dominant, Minnesota has a long history with non-Christian faiths. <a href="Ashkenazi">Ashkenazi</a> <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> pioneers set up Saint Paul's first <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> in 1856.

Minnesotans have low rates of premature death, infant mortality, cardiovascular disease, and occupational fatalities. They have long life expectancies, and high rates of health insurance and regular exercise. These and other measures have led two groups to rank Minnesota as the healthiest state in the nation; however, in one of these rankings, Minnesota descended from first to sixth in the nation between 2005 and 2009 because of low levels of public health funding and the prevalence of <a href="binge%20drinking">binge drinking</a>. While overall health indicators are strong, Minnesota does have significant health disparities in minority populations.

On October 1, 2007, Minnesota became the 17th state to enact the <a href="Freedom%20to%20Breathe%20Act">Freedom to Breathe Act</a>, a statewide smoking ban in restaurants and bars.

As with the federal government of the United States, power in Minnesota is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.

The executive branch is headed by the <a href="Governor%20%28United%20States%29">governor</a>. Governor <a href="Tim%20Walz">Tim Walz</a>, DFL (<a href="Minnesota%20Democratic%E2%80%93Farmer%E2%80%93Labor%20Party">Democratic Farmer Labor</a>), took office on January 7, 2019. The governor has a <a href="cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a> consisting of the leaders of various state government agencies, called commissioners. The other elected constitutional offices are <a href="List%20of%20secretaries%20of%20state%20of%20Minnesota">secretary of state</a>, <a href="Minnesota%20Attorney%20General">attorney general</a>, and <a href="Minnesota%20State%20Auditor">state auditor</a>.

Constitutional officeholders:

The <a href="Minnesota%20Legislature">Minnesota Legislature</a> is a <a href="bicameral">bicameral</a> body consisting of the <a href="Minnesota%20Senate">Senate</a> and the <a href="Minnesota%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>. The state has 67 districts, each with about 60,000 people. Each district has one senator and two representatives, each senatorial district being divided into "A" and "B" sections for members of the House. Senators serve for four years and representatives for two years. In the November 2010 election, the <a href="Minnesota%20Republican%20Party">Minnesota Republican Party</a> gained 25 house seats, giving them control of the House of Representatives by a 72–62 margin. The 2010 election also saw Minnesota voters elect a Republican majority in the Senate for the first time since 1972. In 2012, the Democrats regained the House of Representatives by a margin of 73–61, picking up 11 seats; the Democrats also regained the Minnesota Senate.

Minnesota's court system has three levels. Most cases start in the <a href="Minnesota%20District%20Courts">district courts</a>, which are courts of general jurisdiction. There are 279 district court judgeships in ten judicial districts. Appeals from the trial courts and challenges to certain governmental decisions are heard by the <a href="Minnesota%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Minnesota Court of Appeals</a>, consisting of 19 judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. The seven-justice <a href="Minnesota%20Supreme%20Court">Minnesota Supreme Court</a> hears all appeals from the tax court, the <a href="Minnesota%20Workers%27%20Compensation%20Court%20of%20Appeals">workers' compensation court of appeals</a>, first-degree murder convictions, and <a href="Certiorari%23State%20courts">discretionary appeals</a> from the court of appeals; it also has <a href="original%20jurisdiction">original jurisdiction</a> over election disputes.

Two specialized courts within administrative agencies have been established: the workers' compensation court of appeals, and the tax court, which deals with non-criminal tax cases.

Along with this <a href="Metropolitan%20Planning%20Organizations">Metropolitan Planning Organizations</a> (MPOs), such as the <a href="Metropolitan%20Council">Metropolitan Council</a>, provide planning and oversight of land use actions in metropolitan areas. Many lakes and rivers are overseen by <a href="Watershed%20district%20%28Minnesota%29">watershed districts</a> and <a href="soil%20and%20water%20conservation%20district">soil and water conservation district</a>s.

Minnesota's <a href="United%20States%20senator">United States senator</a>s are Democrat <a href="Amy%20Klobuchar">Amy Klobuchar</a> and Democrat <a href="Tina%20Smith">Tina Smith</a>. The outcome of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Minnesota%2C%202008">2008 U.S. Senate election in Minnesota</a> was contested until June 30, 2009; when the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in favor of Franken, Republican <a href="Norm%20Coleman">Norm Coleman</a> conceded defeat.

The State of Minnesota was created by the United States federal government in the traditional and cultural range of lands occupied by the <a href="Dakota%20people">Dakota</a> and <a href="Anishinaabe">Anishinaabe</a> peoples as well as other Native American groups. After many years of unequal treaties and forced resettlement by the state and federal government, the tribes re-organized into sovereign tribal governments. Today, the tribal governments are divided into 11 semi-autonomous <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservations</a> that negotiate with the US and the state on a bilateral basis:

Four Dakota <a href="Mdewakanton">Mdewakanton</a> communities:

Seven Anishinaabe reservations:

The first six of the Anishinaabe bands compose the <a href="Minnesota%20Chippewa%20Tribe">Minnesota Chippewa Tribe</a>, the collective federally recognized tribal government of the Bois Forte, Fond du Lac, Grand Portage, Leech Lake, Mille Lacs, and White Earth reservations.

Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and <a href="populism">populism</a> has been a long-standing force among the state's <a href="political%20party">political parties</a>. Minnesota has a consistently high <a href="voter%20turnout">voter turnout</a>. In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">2008 U.S. presidential election</a>, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on <a href="Election%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">election day</a> at their <a href="polling%20places">polling places</a> with evidence of residency.

<a href="Hubert%20Humphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a> brought national attention to the state with his address at the <a href="1948%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1948 Democratic National Convention</a>. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>.

Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level "Democratic" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the <a href="Minnesota%20Democratic-Farmer-Labor%20Party">Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party</a> (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and <a href="Minnesota%20Farmer-Labor%20Party">Farmer-Labor</a> parties.

The state has had active third-party movements. The <a href="Reform%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reform Party</a>, now the <a href="Independence%20Party%20of%20Minnesota">Independence Party</a>, was able to elect former mayor of <a href="Brooklyn%20Park%2C%20Minnesota">Brooklyn Park</a> and <a href="professional%20wrestler">professional wrestler</a> <a href="Jesse%20Ventura">Jesse Ventura</a> to the <a href="Minnesota%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201998">governorship in 1998</a>. The <a href="Independence%20Party%20of%20Minnesota">Independence Party</a> has received enough support to keep major-party status. The <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20Minnesota">Green Party</a>, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President).

The state's <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> seats have generally been split since the early 1990s, and in the <a href="108th%20United%20States%20Congress">108th</a> and <a href="109th%20United%20States%20Congress">109th</a> Congresses, Minnesota's congressional delegation was split, with four representatives and one senator from each party. In the 2006 mid-term election, Democrats were elected to all state offices, except governor and lieutenant governor, where Republicans <a href="Tim%20Pawlenty">Tim Pawlenty</a> and <a href="Carol%20Molnau">Carol Molnau</a> narrowly won re-election. The DFL posted double-digit gains in both houses of the legislature, elected Amy Klobuchar to the U.S. Senate, and increased the party's U.S. House caucus by one. Keith Ellison (DFL) was elected as the first <a href="African%20American">African American</a> U.S. Representative from Minnesota, as well as the first <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> elected to Congress nationwide. In 2008, DFLer and former comedian and radio talk show host <a href="Al%20Franken">Al Franken</a> beat incumbent Republican <a href="Norm%20Coleman">Norm Coleman</a> in the United States Senate race by 312 votes out of 3 million cast.

In the 2010 election, Republicans took control of both chambers of the Minnesota legislature for the first time in 38 years and, with Mark Dayton's election, the DFL party took the governor's office for the first time in 20 years. Two years later, the DFL regained control of both houses, and with Dayton in office, the party had same-party control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1990. Two years later, the Republicans regained control of the Minnesota House, and in 2016, the GOP also regained control of the State Senate.

In 2018, the DFL retook control of the Minnesota House, while electing DFLer <a href="Tim%20Walz">Tim Walz</a> as Governor.

Maniac Mansion

Maniac Mansion is a 1987 <a href="graphic%20adventure%20game">graphic adventure</a> video game developed and published by <a href="LucasArts">Lucasfilm Games</a>. It follows teenage protagonist Dave Miller as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend from a <a href="mad%20scientist">mad scientist</a>, whose mind has been enslaved by a sentient meteor. The player uses a <a href="point-and-click">point-and-click</a> interface to guide Dave and two of his six playable friends through the scientist's mansion while solving puzzles and avoiding dangers. Gameplay is <a href="Nonlinear%20gameplay">non-linear</a>, and the game must be completed in different ways based on the player's choice of characters. Initially released for the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> and <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a>, "Maniac Mansion" was Lucasfilm Games' first <a href="Self-publishing">self-published</a> product.

The game was conceived in 1985 by <a href="Ron%20Gilbert">Ron Gilbert</a> and <a href="Gary%20Winnick%20%28game%20developer%29">Gary Winnick</a>, who sought to tell a comedic story based on horror film and <a href="B-movie">B-movie</a> clichés. They mapped out the project as a <a href="paper-and-pencil%20game">paper-and-pencil game</a> before coding commenced. While earlier adventure titles had relied on <a href="Command-line%20interface">command lines</a>, Gilbert disliked such systems, and he developed "Maniac Mansion"s simpler point-and-click interface as a replacement. To speed up production, he created a <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> called <a href="SCUMM">SCUMM</a>, which was used in <a href="LucasArts%20adventure%20games">many later LucasArts titles</a>. After its release, "Maniac Mansion" was <a href="porting%20of%20video%20games">ported</a> to several platforms. A port for the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> had to be reworked heavily, in response to complaints by <a href="Nintendo%20of%20America">Nintendo of America</a> that the game was inappropriate for children.

"Maniac Mansion" was critically acclaimed: reviewers lauded its graphics, <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s, animation, and humor. Writer <a href="Orson%20Scott%20Card">Orson Scott Card</a> praised it as a step toward "computer games [becoming] a valid storytelling art". It influenced numerous graphic adventure titles, and its point-and-click interface became a standard feature in the genre. The game's success solidified Lucasfilm as a serious rival to adventure game studios such as <a href="Sierra%20Entertainment">Sierra On-Line</a>. In 1990, "Maniac Mansion" was adapted into a three-season <a href="Maniac%20Mansion%20%28TV%20series%29">television series of the same name</a>, written by <a href="Eugene%20Levy">Eugene Levy</a> and starring <a href="Joe%20Flaherty">Joe Flaherty</a>. A sequel to the game, entitled "<a href="Day%20of%20the%20Tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a>", was released in 1993.

"Maniac Mansion" is a <a href="graphic%20adventure%20game">graphic adventure game</a> in which the player uses a <a href="point-and-click">point-and-click</a> interface to guide characters through a <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">two-dimensional</a> game world and to solve puzzles. Fifteen action commands, such as "Walk To" and "Unlock", may be selected by the player from a menu on the screen's lower half. The player starts the game by choosing two out of six characters to accompany protagonist Dave Miller. Each character possesses unique abilities: for example, Syd and Razor can play musical instruments, while Bernard can repair appliances. The game may be completed with any combination of characters; but, since many puzzles are solvable only by certain characters, different paths must be taken based on the group's composition. "Maniac Mansion" features <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s, a word coined by <a href="Ron%20Gilbert">Ron Gilbert</a>, that interrupt gameplay to advance the story and inform the player about offscreen events.

The game takes place in the <a href="mansion">mansion</a> of the fictional Edison family: Dr. Fred, a <a href="mad%20scientist">mad scientist</a>; Nurse Edna, his wife; and their son Weird Ed. Living with the Edisons are two large, disembodied tentacles, one purple and the other green. The intro sequence shows that a sentient meteor crashed near the mansion twenty years earlier; it brainwashed the Edisons and directed Dr. Fred to obtain human brains for use in experiments. The game begins as Dave Miller prepares to enter the mansion to rescue his girlfriend, Sandy Pantz, who had been kidnapped by Dr. Fred. With the exception of the green tentacle, the mansion's inhabitants are hostile, and will throw the <a href="player%20character">player character</a>s into the dungeon—or, in some situations, kill them—if they see them. When a character dies, the player must choose a replacement from the unselected characters; and the <a href="game%20over">game ends</a> if all characters are killed. "Maniac Mansion" has five possible endings, based on which characters are chosen, which survive, and what the characters accomplish.

"Maniac Mansion" was conceived in 1985 when <a href="Lucasfilm%20Games">Lucasfilm Games</a> employees <a href="Ron%20Gilbert">Ron Gilbert</a> and <a href="Gary%20Winnick%20%28game%20developer%29">Gary Winnick</a> were assigned to create an original game. Gilbert had been hired the previous year as a programmer for the game "<a href="Koronis%20Rift">Koronis Rift</a>". He befriended Winnick over their similar tastes in humor, film, and television. Company management provided little oversight in the creation of "Maniac Mansion", a trend to which Gilbert credited the success of several of his games for Lucasfilm.

Gilbert and Winnick co-wrote and co-designed the project, but they worked separately as well: Gilbert on programming and Winnick on visuals. As both of them enjoyed <a href="B%20movie">B horror films</a>, they decided to make a comedy-horror game set in a haunted house. They drew inspiration from a film whose name Winnick could not recall. He described it as "a ridiculous teen horror movie", in which teenagers inside a building were killed one by one without any thought of leaving. This film, combined with clichés from popular horror movies such as "<a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20%281980%20film%29">Friday the 13th</a>" and "<a href="A%20Nightmare%20on%20Elm%20Street">A Nightmare on Elm Street</a>", became the basis for the game's setting. Early work on the game progressed organically: according to Gilbert, "Very little was written down. Gary and I just talked and laughed a lot, and out it came." Lucasfilm Games relocated to the Stable House at <a href="Skywalker%20Ranch">Skywalker Ranch</a> during "Maniac Mansion"s conception period, and the ranch's Main House was used as a model for the mansion. Several rooms from the Main House received exact reproductions in the game, such as a library with a spiral staircase and a media room with a large-screen TV and <a href="grand%20piano">grand piano</a>.

Story and characters were a primary concern for Gilbert and Winnick. The pair based the game's cast on friends, family members, acquaintances, and stereotypes. For example, Winnick's girlfriend Ray was the inspiration for Razor, while Dave and Wendy were based, respectively, on Gilbert and a fellow Lucasfilm employee named Wendy. According to Winnick, the Edison family was shaped after characters from <a href="EC%20Comics">EC Comics</a> and <a href="Warren%20Publishing">Warren Publishing</a> magazines. The sentient meteor that brainwashes Dr. Fred was inspired by a segment from the 1982 <a href="anthology%20film">anthology film</a> "<a href="Creepshow">Creepshow</a>". A man-eating plant, similar to that of "<a href="Little%20Shop%20of%20Horrors%20%28film%29">Little Shop of Horrors</a>", was included as well. The developers sought to strike a balance between tension and humor with the game's story.

Initially, Gilbert and Winnick struggled to choose a <a href="Video%20game%20genre">gameplay genre</a> for "Maniac Mansion". While visiting relatives over Christmas, Gilbert saw his cousin play "<a href="King%27s%20Quest%20I">King's Quest: Quest for the Crown</a>", an adventure game by <a href="Sierra%20Entertainment">Sierra On-Line</a>. Although he was a fan of text adventures, this was Gilbert's first experience with a graphic adventure, and he used the holiday to play the game and familiarize himself with the format. As a result, he decided to develop his and Winnick's ideas into a graphic adventure game.

"Maniac Mansion"s story and structure were designed before coding commenced. The project's earliest incarnation was a <a href="Paper-and-pencil%20game">paper-and-pencil board game</a>, in which the mansion's floor plan was used as a game board, and cards represented events and characters. Lines connected the rooms to illustrate pathways by which characters could travel. Strips of <a href="cellulose%20acetate">cellulose acetate</a> were used to map out the game's puzzles by tracking which items worked together when used by certain characters. Impressed by the map's complexity, Winnick included it in the final game as a poster hung on a wall. Because each character contributes different skills and resources, the pair spent months working on the event combinations that could occur. This extended the game's production time beyond that of previous Lucasfilm Games projects, which almost led to Gilbert's firing. The game's dialogue, written by <a href="David%20Fox%20%28game%20designer%29">David Fox</a>, was not created until after programming had begun.

Gilbert started programming "Maniac Mansion" in 6502 <a href="assembly%20language">assembly language</a>, but he quickly decided that the project was too large and complex for this method. He decided that a new <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> would have to be created. Its coding language was initially planned to be <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a>-inspired, but Gilbert opted for one similar to <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>. Lucasfilm employee <a href="Chip%20Morningstar">Chip Morningstar</a> contributed the base code for the engine, which Gilbert then built on. Gilbert hoped to create a "system that could be used on many adventure games, cutting down the time it took to make them". "Maniac Mansion"s first six-to-nine months of production were dedicated largely to engine development. The game was developed around the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a>, an 8-bit system with only 64 <a href="Kilobyte">KB</a> of memory. The team wanted to include <a href="scrolling">scrolling</a> screens, but as it was normally impossible to scroll bitmap graphics on the Commodore 64, they had to use lower-detail tile graphics. Winnick gave each character a large head made of three stacked sprites to make them recognizable.

Although Gilbert wrote much of the foundational code for "Maniac Mansion", the majority of the game's events were programmed by Lucasfilm employee <a href="David%20Fox%20%28game%20designer%29">David Fox</a>. Fox was between projects and planned to work on the game only for a month, but he remained with the team for six months. With Gilbert, he wrote the characters' dialog and choreographed the action. Winnick's concept art inspired him to add new elements to the game: for example, Fox allowed the player to place a hamster inside the kitchen's microwave.

The team wanted to avoid punishing the player for applying everyday logic in "Maniac Mansion". Fox noted that one Sierra game features a scene in which the player, without prior warning, may encounter a <a href="game%20over">game over</a> screen simply by picking up a shard of glass. He characterized such game design as "sadistic", and he commented, "I know that in the real world I can successfully pick up a broken piece of mirror without dying". Because of the project's <a href="Nonlinear%20gameplay">nonlinear puzzle design</a>, the team struggled to prevent <a href="No-win%20situation%23In%20video%20games">no-win scenarios</a>, in which the player unexpectedly became unable to complete the game. As a result of this problem, Gilbert later explained, "We were constantly fighting against the desire just to rip out all the endings and just go with three characters, or even sometimes just one character". Lucasfilm Games had only one <a href="playtest">playtest</a>er, and many dead-ends went undetected as a result. Further playtesting was provided by Gilbert's uncle, to whom Gilbert mailed a <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy disk</a> of the game's latest version each week.

The "Maniac Mansion" team wanted to retain the structure of a text-based adventure game, but without the standard <a href="command-line%20interface">command-line interface</a>. Gilbert and Winnick were frustrated by the genre's <a href="text%20parser">text parser</a>s and frequent game over screens. While in college, Gilbert had enjoyed "<a href="Colossal%20Cave%20Adventure">Colossal Cave Adventure</a>" and the games of <a href="Infocom">Infocom</a>, but he disliked their lack of visuals. He found the inclusion of graphics in Sierra On-Line games, such as "King's Quest", to be a step in the right direction, but these games still require the player to type, and to guess which commands must be input. In response, Gilbert programmed a point-and-click <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a> that displays every possible command. Fox had made a similar attempt to streamline Lucasfilm's earlier "" and he conceived the entirety of "Maniac Mansion"s interface, according to Gilbert. Forty input commands were planned at first, but the number was gradually reduced to 12. Gilbert finished the "Maniac Mansion" engine—which he later named "Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion" (<a href="SCUMM">SCUMM</a>)—after roughly one year of work. Although the game was designed for the Commodore 64, the SCUMM engine allowed it to be <a href="Porting%20of%20video%20games">ported</a> easily to other platforms.

After 18 to 24 months of development, "Maniac Mansion" debuted at the 1987 <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. The game was released for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in October 1987. While previous Lucasfilm Games products had been published by outside companies, "Maniac Mansion" was self-published. This became a trend at Lucasfilm. The company hired Ken Macklin, an acquaintance of Winnick's, to design the game's packaging artwork. Gilbert and Winnick collaborated with the marketing department to design the back cover. The two also created an insert that includes hints, a backstory, and jokes. An MS-DOS port was released in early 1988, developed in part by Lucasfilm employees Aric Wilmunder and Brad Taylor. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST and <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (NES) followed, with the Amiga and Atari ST ports in 1989 and the NES port in 1990. The 16-bit versions of Maniac Mansion featured a copy protection system requiring the user to enter graphical symbols out of a code book included with the game. This was not present in the Commodore 64 and Apple versions due to lack of disk space, so those instead used an on-disk copy protection.

There were two separate versions of the game developed for the NES. The first port was handled and published by <a href="Jaleco">Jaleco</a> only in Japan. Released on June 23, 1988, it featured characters redrawn in a cute art style and generally shrunken rooms. No scrolling is present, leading to rooms larger than a single screen to be displayed via flip-screens. Many of the background details are missing, and instead of a save feature a password, over 100 characters long, is required to save progress.
In September 1990 Jaleco released an American version of "Maniac Mansion" as the first NES title developed by Lucasfilm Games in cooperation with Realtime Associates. Generally, this port is regarded as being far closer to the original game than the Japanese effort.

Company management was occupied with other projects, and so the port received little attention until employee <a href="Douglas%20Crockford">Douglas Crockford</a> volunteered to direct it. The team used a modified version of the SCUMM engine called "NES SCUMM" for the port. According to Crockford, "[One] of the main differences between the NES and PCs is that the NES can do certain things much faster". The graphics had to be entirely redrawn to match the NES's <a href="display%20resolution">display resolution</a>. <a href="Tim%20Schafer">Tim Schafer</a>, who later designed "Maniac Mansion"s sequel "<a href="Day%20of%20the%20Tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a>", received his first professional credit as a playtester for the NES version of "Maniac Mansion".

During "Maniac Mansion"s development for the Commodore 64, Lucasfilm had censored profanity in the script: for instance, the early line of dialogue "Don't be a shit head" became "Don't be a tuna head". Additional content was removed from the NES version to make it suitable for a younger audience, and to conform with Nintendo's policies. Jaleco USA president Howie Rubin warned Crockford about content to which Nintendo might object, such as the word "kill". After reading the NES Game Standards Policy for himself, Crockford suspected that further elements of "Maniac Mansion" could be problematic, and he sent a list of questionable content to Jaleco. When the company replied that the content was reasonable, Lucasfilm Games submitted "Maniac Mansion" for approval.

One month later, Nintendo of America contacted Lucasfilm Games to request the removal of offensive text and nude graphics. Crockford censored this content but attempted to leave the game's essence intact. For example, Nintendo wanted graffiti in one room—which provided an important hint to players—removed from the game. Unable to comply without simultaneously removing the hint, the team simply shortened it. Sexually suggestive and otherwise "graphic" dialogue was edited, including a remark from Dr. Fred about "pretty brains [being] sucked out". The nudity described by Nintendo encompassed a swimsuit calendar, a <a href="classical%20sculpture">classical sculpture</a> and a poster of a mummy in a <a href="Playboy%20Playmate">Playmate</a> pose. After a brief fight to keep the sculpture, the team ultimately removed all three. The phrase "NES SCUMM" in the credits sequence was censored as well.

Lucasfilm Games re-submitted the edited version of "Maniac Mansion" to Nintendo, which then manufactured 250,000 cartridges. Each cartridge was fitted with a battery-powered back-up to save data. Nintendo announced the port through its <a href="Nintendo%20Power">official magazine</a> in early 1990, and it provided further coverage later that year. The ability to microwave a hamster remained in the game, which Crockford cited as an example of the censors' contradictory criteria. Nintendo later noticed it, and after the first batch of cartridges was sold, Jaleco was forced to remove the content from future shipments.

Late in development, Jaleco commissioned <a href="Realtime%20Associates">Realtime Associates</a> to provide background music, which no previous version of "Maniac Mansion" had featured. Realtime Associates' founder and president David Warhol noted that "video games at that time had to have 'wall to wall' music". He brought in <a href="George%20Sanger%20%28musician%29">George "The Fat Man" Sanger</a> and his band, along with <a href="David%20Hayes%20%28musician%29">David Hayes</a>, to compose the score. Their goal was to create songs that suited each character, such as a <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> theme for Razor, an <a href="electronic%20rock">electronic rock</a> theme for Bernard and a version of <a href="Thin%20Lizzy">Thin Lizzy</a>'s "<a href="The%20Boys%20Are%20Back%20in%20Town">The Boys Are Back in Town</a>" for Dave Miller. Warhol translated their work into NES <a href="chiptune">chiptune</a> music.

Keith Farrell of "<a href="Compute%21%27s%20Gazette">Compute!'s Gazette</a>" was struck by "Maniac Mansion"s similarity to film, particularly in its use of cutscenes to impart "information or urgency". He lauded the game's graphics, animation and high level of detail. "<a href="Commodore%20User">Commodore User</a>"s Bill Scolding and three reviewers from "<a href="Zzap%2164">Zzap!64</a>" compared the game to "<a href="The%20Rocky%20Horror%20Picture%20Show">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>". Further comparisons were drawn to "<a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">Psycho</a>", "<a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20%28franchise%29">Friday the 13th</a>", "<a href="The%20Texas%20Chain%20Saw%20Massacre">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>", "<a href="The%20Addams%20Family">The Addams Family</a>" and "<a href="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a>". Russ Ceccola of "Commodore Magazine" found the cutscenes to be creative and well made, and he commented that the "characters are distinctively Lucasfilm's, bringing facial expressions and personality to each individual character". In "Compute!", <a href="Orson%20Scott%20Card">Orson Scott Card</a> praised the game's humor, cinematic storytelling and lack of violence. He called it "compellingly good" and evidence of Lucasfilm's push "to make computer games a valid storytelling art".

German magazine "Happy-Computer" commended the point-and-click interface and likened it to that of "<a href="Uninvited%20%28video%20game%29">Uninvited</a>" by <a href="ICOM%20Simulations">ICOM Simulations</a>. The publication highlighted "Maniac Mansion"s graphics, originality, and overall enjoyability: one of the writers called it the best adventure title yet released. "Happy-Computer" later reported that "Maniac Mansion" was the highest-selling video game in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> for three consecutive months. The game's humor received praise from "Zzap!64", whose reviewers called the point-and-click controls "tremendous" and the total package "innovative and polished". Shay Addams of "Questbusters: The Adventurer's Newsletter" preferred "Maniac Mansion"s interface to that of "Labyrinth: The Computer Game". He considered the game to be Lucasfilm's best, and he recommended it to Commodore 64 and Apple II users unable to run titles with better visuals, such as those from Sierra On-Line. A writer for "<a href="ACE%20%28games%20magazine%29">ACE</a>" enjoyed the game's animation and depth, but he noted that fans of text-based adventures would dislike the game's simplicity. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" picked the game as the #20 greatest game available in 1991, saying: "The graphics are merely okay and the music is Nintendo at its tinniest, but Maniac Mansion's plot is enough to overcome these faults. In this command-driven game — adapted from the computer hit — three buddies venture into a sinister haunted mansion and wind up juggling a bunch of wacky story lines."

Reviewing the MS-DOS and <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari ST</a> ports, a critic from "<a href="The%20Games%20Machine">The Games Machine</a>" called "Maniac Mansion" "an enjoyable romp" that was structurally superior to later <a href="LucasArts%20adventure%20games">LucasArts adventure games</a>. The writer noticed poor <a href="pathfinding%23In%20video%20games">pathfinding</a> and disliked the limited audio. Reviewers for "<a href="Deseret%20News">The Deseret News</a>" lauded the audiovisuals and considered the product "wonderful fun". "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>"s <a href="Charles%20Ardai">Charles Ardai</a> praised the game for attaining "the necessary and precarious balance between laughs and suspense that so many comic horror films and novels lack". Although he faulted the control system's limited options, he hailed it as "one of the most comfortable ever devised". Writing for "<a href="VideoGames%20%26amp%3B%20Computer%20Entertainment">VideoGames & Computer Entertainment</a>", Bill Kunkel and Joyce Worley stated that the game's plot and premise were typical of the horror genre; but they praised the interface and execution.

Reviewing "Maniac Mansion"s Amiga version four years after its release, Simon Byron of "<a href="The%20One%20%28magazine%29">The One Amiga</a>" praised the game for retaining "charm and humour", but suggested that its art direction had become "tacky" compared to more recent titles. Stephen Bradly of "<a href="Amiga%20Format">Amiga Format</a>" found the game derivative, but he encountered "loads of visual humour" in it; and he added, "Strangely, it's quite compelling after a while." Michael Labiner of Germany's "Amiga Joker" considered "Maniac Mansion" to be one of the best adventure games for the system. He noted minor graphical flaws, such as a limited color palette, but he argued that the gameplay made up for such shortcomings. Writing for "Datormagazin" in Sweden, Ingela Palmér commented that the Amiga and Commodore 64 versions of "Maniac Mansion" were nearly identical. She criticized the graphics and gameplay of both releases but felt the game to be highly enjoyable regardless.

Reviewing the NES release, British magazine "<a href="Mean%20Machines">Mean Machines</a>" commended the game's presentation, playability, and replay value. The publication also noted undetailed graphics and "ear-bashing tunes". The magazine's Julian Rignall compared "Maniac Mansion" to the title "Shadowgate", but he preferred the former's controls and lack of "death-without-warning situations". Writers for Germany's "Video Games" referred to the NES version as a "classic". Co-reviewer Heinrich Lenhardt stated that "Maniac Mansion" was unlike any other NES adventure game, and that it was no less enjoyable than its home computer releases. Co-reviewer Winnie Forster found it to be "one of the most original representatives of the [adventure game] genre". In retrospective features, <a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">"Edge" magazine</a> called the NES version "somewhat neutered" and "<a href="GamesTM">GamesTM</a>" referred to it as "infamous" and "heavily censored".

Lucasfilm conceived the idea for a television adaptation of "Maniac Mansion", the rights to which were purchased by <a href="Television%20networks%20preceding%20ABC%20Family%23The%20Family%20Channel">The Family Channel</a> in 1990. The two companies collaborated with Atlantis Films to produce a <a href="Maniac%20Mansion%20%28TV%20series%29">sitcom named after the game</a>, which debuted in September of that year. It aired on <a href="YTV%20%28TV%20channel%29">YTV</a> in Canada and The Family Channel in the United States. Based in part on the video game, the series focuses on the Edison family's life and stars <a href="Joe%20Flaherty">Joe Flaherty</a> as Dr. Fred. Its writing staff was led by <a href="Eugene%20Levy">Eugene Levy</a>. Gilbert later said that the premise of the series changed during production until it differed heavily from the game's original plot. Upon its debut, the adaptation received positive reviews from "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>", "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" and the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>". "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" named it one of the year's best new series. <a href="Ken%20Tucker">Ken Tucker</a> of "Entertainment Weekly" questioned the decision to air the series on The Family Channel, given Flaherty's subversive humor. Discussing the series in retrospect, Richard Cobbett of "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" criticized its generic storylines and lack of relevance to the game. The series lasted for three seasons; sixty-six episodes were filmed.

In the early 1990s, LucasArts tasked Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer, both of whom had worked on the "Monkey Island" series, with designing a sequel to "Maniac Mansion". Gilbert and Winnick initially assisted with the project's writing. The team included voice acting and more detailed graphics, which Gilbert had originally envisioned for "Maniac Mansion". The first game's nonlinear design was discarded, and the team implemented a <a href="Chuck%20Jones">Chuck Jones</a>-inspired visual style, alongside numerous puzzles based on time travel. Bernard and the Edison family were retained. The sequel, entitled "<a href="Day%20of%20the%20Tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a>", was released in 1993, and came with a fully playable copy of "Maniac Mansion" hidden as an easter egg.

In 2010, the staff of "GamesTM" dubbed "Maniac Mansion" a "seminal" title that overhauled the gameplay of the graphic adventure genre. Removing the need to <a href="Syntax%20guessing">guess syntax</a> allowed players to concentrate on the story and puzzles, which created a smoother and more enjoyable experience, according to the magazine. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed agreed: he believed that the design was "infinitely more elegant and intuitive" than its predecessors and that it freed players from "guessing-game frustration". Designer <a href="Dave%20Grossman%20%28game%20developer%29">Dave Grossman</a>, who worked on Lucasfilm Games' later "Day of the Tentacle" and "<a href="The%20Secret%20of%20Monkey%20Island">The Secret of Monkey Island</a>", felt that "Maniac Mansion" had revolutionized the adventure game genre. Although 1985's "Uninvited" had featured a point-and-click interface, it was not influential. "Maniac Mansion"s implementation of the concept was widely imitated in other adventure titles. Writing in the <a href="game%20studies">game studies</a> journal "Kinephanos", Jonathan Lessard argued that "Maniac Mansion" led a "<a href="Casual%20game">Casual</a> Revolution" in the late 1980s, which opened the adventure genre to a wider audience. Similarly, Christopher Buecheler of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> called the game a contributor to its genre's subsequent critical adoration and commercial success.

Reed highlighted the "wonderfully ambitious" design of "Maniac Mansion", in reference to its writing, interface, and cast of characters. Game designer <a href="Sheri%20Graner%20Ray">Sheri Graner Ray</a> believed the game to challenge "<a href="damsel%20in%20distress">damsel in distress</a>" stereotypes through its inclusion of female protagonists. Conversely, writer <a href="Mark%20Dery">Mark Dery</a> argued that the goal of rescuing a kidnapped cheerleader reinforced negative <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a>s. The Lucasfilm team built on their experiences from "Maniac Mansion" and became increasingly ambitious in subsequent titles. Gilbert admitted to making mistakes—such as the inclusion of <a href="no-win%20situation">no-win situation</a>s—in "Maniac Mansion", and he applied these lessons to future projects. For example, the game relies on <a href="Time-driven%20programming">timers</a> rather than <a href="Event-driven%20programming">events</a> to trigger cutscenes, which occasionally results in awkward transitions: Gilbert worked to avoid this flaw with the <a href="Monkey%20Island%20%28series%29">"Monkey Island" series</a>. Because of "Maniac Mansion"s imperfections, Gilbert considers it his favorite of his games.

According to writers Mike and Sandie Morrison, Lucasfilm Games became "serious competition" in the adventure genre after the release of "Maniac Mansion". The game's success solidified Lucasfilm as one of the leading producers of adventure games: authors Rusel DeMaria and Johnny Wilson described it as a "landmark title" for the company. In their view, "Maniac Mansion"—along with "<a href="Space%20Quest%20I">Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter</a>" and "<a href="Leisure%20Suit%20Larry%20in%20the%20Land%20of%20the%20Lounge%20Lizards">Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards</a>"—inaugurated a "new era of humor-based adventure games". This belief was shared by Reed, who wrote that "Maniac Mansion" "set in motion a captivating chapter in the history of gaming" that encompassed wit, invention, and style. The SCUMM engine was reused by Lucasfilm in eleven later titles; improvements were made to its code with each game. Over time, rival adventure game developers adopted this paradigm in their own software. "GamesTM" attributed the change to a desire to streamline production and create enjoyable games. Following his 1992 departure from LucasArts—a conglomeration of Lucasfilm Games, <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">ILM</a> and <a href="Skywalker%20Sound">Skywalker Sound</a> formed in 1990—Gilbert used SCUMM to create adventure games and "<a href="Backyard%20Sports%20series">Backyard Sports</a>" titles for <a href="Humongous%20Entertainment">Humongous Entertainment</a>.

In 2011, Richard Cobbett summarized "Maniac Mansion" as "one of the most intricate and important adventure games ever made". "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" ranked it as one of the ten best Commodore 64 games in 2006, and <a href="IGN">IGN</a> later named it one of the ten best <a href="LucasArts%20adventure%20games">LucasArts adventure games</a>. Seven years after the NES version's debut, "Nintendo Power" named it the 61st best game ever. The publication dubbed it the 16th best NES title in 2008. The game's uniqueness and clever writing were praised by "Nintendo Power": in 2010, the magazine's Chris Hoffman stated that the game is "unlike anything else out there — a point-and-click adventure with an awesome sense of humor and multiple solutions to almost every puzzle." In its retrospective coverage, "Nintendo Power" several times noted the ability to microwave a hamster, which the staff considered to be an iconic scene. In March 2012, "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" listed the hamster incident as one of the "100 Classic Gaming Moments".

"Maniac Mansion" enthusiasts have drawn <a href="fan%20art">fan art</a> of its characters, participated in tentacle-themed <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a> and produced a <a href="Trailer%20%28film%29">trailer</a> for a fictitious film adaptation of the game. German fan Sascha Borisow created a <a href="fan%20game">fan game</a> remake, entitled "Maniac Mansion Deluxe", with enhanced audio and visuals. He used the <a href="Adventure%20Game%20Studio">Adventure Game Studio</a> engine to develop the project, which he distributed free of charge on the Internet. By the end of 2004, the remake had over 200,000 downloads. A remake with <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional graphics</a> called "<a href="Meteor%20Mess">Meteor Mess</a>" was created by the German developer Vampyr Games, and, as of 2011, another group in Germany is producing one with art direction similar to that of "Day of the Tentacle". Fans have created an <a href="Episodic%20video%20game">episodic series of games</a> based on "Maniac Mansion" as well. Gilbert has said that he would like to see an official remake, similar in its graphics and gameplay to "The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition" and "Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck's Revenge". He also expressed doubts about its potential quality, in light of <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a>'s enhanced remakes of the original "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" trilogy. In December 2017, <a href="Disney">Disney</a>, which gained rights to the LucasArts games following its acquisition of Lucasfilms, published "Maniac Mansion" running atop the <a href="ScummVM">ScummVM</a> virtual machine to various digital storefronts.

Mary Rose

The Mary Rose is a <a href="carrack">carrack</a>-type <a href="warship">warship</a> of the English <a href="Tudor%20navy">Tudor navy</a> of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">King Henry VIII</a>. After serving for 33 years in several wars against <a href="Early%20modern%20France">France</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a>, and <a href="History%20of%20Brittany">Brittany</a> and after being substantially rebuilt in 1536, she saw her last action on 1545. While leading the attack on the <a href="galley">galley</a>s of a French invasion fleet, she sank in the <a href="Solent">Solent</a>, the straits north of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>.

The wreck of the "Mary Rose" was rediscovered in 1971. It was raised on 11 October 1982 by the <a href="Mary%20Rose%20Trust">Mary Rose Trust</a>, in one of the most complex and expensive projects in the history of <a href="maritime%20archaeology">maritime archaeology</a>. The surviving section of the ship and thousands of recovered artefacts are of immeasurable value as a <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor-era</a> <a href="time%20capsule">time capsule</a>. The excavation and raising of the "Mary Rose" was a milestone in the field of maritime archaeology, comparable in complexity and cost only to the raising of the Swedish 17th-century warship "<a href="Vasa%20%28ship%29">Vasa</a>" in 1961.

The finds include weapons, sailing equipment, naval supplies and a wide array of objects used by the crew. Many of the artefacts are unique to the "Mary Rose" and have provided insights into topics ranging from <a href="naval%20warfare">naval warfare</a> to the history of musical instruments. Since the mid-1980s, while undergoing conservation, the remains of the hull have been on display at the <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">Portsmouth Historic Dockyard</a>. An extensive collection of well-preserved artefacts is on display at the <a href="Mary%20Rose%20Museum">Mary Rose Museum</a>, built to display the remains of the ship and its artefacts alongside each other.

The "Mary Rose" was one of the largest ships in the English navy through more than three decades of intermittent war and was one of the earliest examples of a purpose-built sailing warship. She was armed with new types of heavy guns that could fire through the recently invented <a href="gun-port">gun-port</a>s. After being substantially rebuilt in 1536, she was also one of the earliest ships that could fire a <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, although the <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a> tactics that employed it had not yet been developed. Several theories have sought to explain the demise of the "Mary Rose", based on historical records, knowledge of 16th-century shipbuilding, and modern experiments. The precise cause of her sinking is still unclear, because of conflicting testimonies and a lack of conclusive physical evidence.

In the late 15th century, England was a relatively insignificant state on the periphery of Europe. The great victories against <a href="Early%20modern%20France">France</a> in the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a> were in the past; only the small enclave of <a href="Calais">Calais</a> in northern France remained of the vast continental holdings of the English kings. The <a href="War%20of%20the%20Roses">War of the Roses</a>—the civil war between the houses of <a href="House%20of%20York">York</a> and <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">Lancaster</a>—had ended with <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a>'s establishment of the <a href="House%20of%20Tudor">House of Tudor</a>, the new ruling dynasty of England. The ambitious naval policies of <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V</a> were not continued by his successors, and from 1422 to 1509 only six ships were built for the crown. The marriage alliance between <a href="Anne%20of%20Brittany">Anne of Brittany</a> and <a href="Charles%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVIII%20of%20France">Charles VIII of France</a> in 1491, and his successor <a href="Louis%20XII%20of%20France">Louis XII</a> in 1499, left England with a weakened strategic position on its southern flank. Despite this, Henry VII managed to maintain a comparatively long period of peace and a small but powerful core of a navy.

At the onset of the <a href="early%20modern%20period">early modern period</a>, the great European powers were France, the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and <a href="Habsburg%20Spain">Spain</a>. All three became involved in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20League%20of%20Cambrai">War of the League of Cambrai</a> in 1508. The conflict was initially aimed at the <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Republic of Venice</a> but eventually turned against France. Through the Spanish possessions in the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>, England had close economic ties with the <a href="Habsburg%20Spain">Spanish Habsburgs</a>, and it was the young <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII's</a> ambition to repeat the glorious martial endeavours of his predecessors. In 1509, six weeks into his reign, Henry married the Spanish princess <a href="Catherine%20of%20Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a> and joined the League, intent on certifying his historical claim as king of both England and France. By 1511 Henry was part of an anti-French alliance that included <a href="Ferdinand%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20Aragon">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a>, <a href="Pope%20Julius%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Pope Julius II</a> and Holy Roman emperor <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian</a>.

The small navy that Henry VIII inherited from his father had only two sizeable ships, the <a href="carrack">carrack</a>s "Regent" and "Sovereign". Just months after his accession, two large ships were ordered: the "Mary Rose" and the "<a href="Peter%20Pomegranate">Peter Pomegranate</a>" (later known as "Peter" after being rebuilt in 1536) of about 500 and 450 tons respectively. Which king ordered the building of the "Mary Rose" is unclear; although construction began during Henry VIII's reign, the plans for naval expansion could have been in the making earlier. Henry VIII oversaw the project and he ordered additional large ships to be built, most notably the "<a href="Henry%20Grace%20%C3%A0%20Dieu">Henry Grace à Dieu</a>" ("Henry by the Grace of God"), or "Great Harry" at more than 1000 tons <a href="Builder%27s%20Old%20Measurement">burthen</a>. By the 1520s the English state had established a "de facto" permanent "Navy Royal", the organizational ancestor of the modern <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>.

The construction of the "Mary Rose" began in 1510 in <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and she was <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> in July 1511. She was then towed to London and fitted with <a href="rigging">rigging</a> and <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">decking</a>, and supplied with armaments. Other than the structural details needed to sail, stock and arm the "Mary Rose", she was also equipped with flags, banners and <a href="pennon">streamers</a> (extremely elongated flags that were flown from the top of the masts) that were either painted or gilded.

Constructing a warship of the size of the "Mary Rose" was a major undertaking, requiring vast quantities of high-quality material. In the case of building a state-of-the-art warship, these materials were primarily oak. The total amount of timber needed for the construction can only be roughly calculated since only about one third of the ship still exists. One estimate for the number of trees is around 600 mostly large <a href="oak">oak</a>s, representing about 16 hectares (40 acres) of woodland. The huge trees that had been common in Europe and the British Isles in previous centuries were by the 16th century quite rare, which meant that timbers were brought in from all over southern England. The largest timbers used in the construction were of roughly the same size as those used in the roofs of the largest cathedrals in the <a href="high%20Middle%20Ages">high Middle Ages</a>. An unworked hull plank would have weighed over 300 kg (660 lb), and one of the main deck <a href="beam%20%28structure%29">beams</a> would have weighed close to three-quarters of a tonne.

The common explanation for the ship's name was that it was inspired by Henry VIII's favourite sister, <a href="Mary%20Tudor%2C%20Queen%20of%20France">Mary Tudor</a>, and the rose as the emblem of the <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudors</a>. According to historians David Childs, <a href="David%20Loades">David Loades</a> and Peter Marsden, no direct evidence of naming the ship after the King's sister exists. It was far more common at the time to give ships pious Christian names, a long-standing tradition in Western Europe, or to associate them with their royal patrons. Names like "Grace Dieu" (<a href="Hallelujah">Thank God</a>) and "Holighost" (<a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>) had been common since the 15th century and other Tudor navy ships had names like the "Regent" and "Three Ostrich Feathers" (referring to the crest of the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>). The <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a> is a more likely candidate for a namesake, and she was also associated with the <a href="Rosa%20Mystica">Rosa Mystica</a> (mystic rose). The name of the sister ship of the "Mary Rose", the "Peter Pomegranate", is believed to have been named in honour of <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a>, and the badge of the Queen <a href="Catharine%20of%20Aragon">Catharine of Aragon</a>, a <a href="pomegranate">pomegranate</a>. According to Childs, Loades and Marsden, the two ships, which were built around the same time, were named in honour of the king and queen, respectively.

The "Mary Rose" was substantially rebuilt in 1536. The 1536 rebuilding turned a ship of 500 tons into one of 700 tons, and added an entire extra tier of broadside guns to the old <a href="carrack">carrack</a>-style structure. By consequence, modern research is based mostly on interpretations of the concrete physical evidence of this version of the "Mary Rose". The construction of the original design from 1509 is less known.

The "Mary Rose" was built according to the <a href="carrack">carrack</a>-style with high "castles" in the bow and stern with a low waist of open decking in the middle. The shape of the hull has a so-called <a href="tumblehome">tumblehome</a> form and reflected the use of the ship as a platform for heavy guns. Above the waterline, the hull gradually narrows to compensate for the weight of the guns and to make boarding more difficult. Since only part of the hull has survived, it is not possible to determine many of the basic dimensions with any great accuracy. The <a href="moulded%20breadth">moulded breadth</a>, the widest point of the ship roughly above the waterline, was about 12 metres (39 ft) and the keel about 32 metres (105 ft), although the ship's overall length is uncertain.

The hull had four levels separated by three <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">decks</a>. The terminology for these in the 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the <a href="Mary%20Rose%20Trust">Mary Rose Trust</a>. The "<a href="hold%20%28ship%29">hold</a>" lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or <a href="galley%20%28kitchen%29">galley</a>, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the mast step, a rebate in the centre-most timber of the <a href="keelson">keelson</a>, right above the <a href="keel">keel</a>, which supported the main mast, and next to it the main <a href="bilge%20pump">bilge pump</a>. To increase the stability of the ship, the hold was where the <a href="sailing%20ballast">ballast</a> was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the "<a href="orlop">orlop</a>", the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.
Above the orlop lay the "main deck" which housed the heaviest guns. The side of the hull on the main deck level had seven gunports on each side fitted with heavy lids that would have been watertight when closed. This was also the highest deck that was caulked and waterproof. Along the sides of the main deck there were cabins under the forecastle and sterncastle which have been identified as belonging to the carpenter, <a href="barber-surgeon">barber-surgeon</a>, pilot and possibly also the master gunner and some of the officers. The top deck in the hull structure was the "upper deck" (or <a href="weather%20deck">weather deck</a>) which was exposed to the elements in the waist. It was a dedicated fighting deck without any known partitions and a mix of heavy and light guns. Over the open waist the upper deck was entirely covered with a <a href="boarding%20net">boarding net</a>, a coarse netting that served as a defence measure against boarding. Though very little of the upper deck has survived, it has been suggested that it housed the main living quarters of the crew underneath the sterncastle. A drainage located in this area has been identified as a possible "piss-dale", a general urinal to complement the regular toilets that would probably have been located in the bow.

The castles of the "Mary Rose" had additional decks, but since virtually nothing of them survives, their design has had to be reconstructed from historical records. Contemporary ships of equal size were consistently listed as having three decks in both castles. Although speculative, this layout is supported by the illustration in the Anthony Roll and the gun inventories.

During the early stages of excavation of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with <a href="clinker%20%28boat%20building%29">clinker</a> (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting <a href="gunport">gunport</a>s into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with <a href="carvel%20%28boat%20building%29">carvel</a> edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.

Although only the lower fittings of the rigging survive, a 1514 inventory and the only known contemporary depiction of the ship from the <a href="Anthony%20Roll">Anthony Roll</a> have been used to determine how the propulsion system of the "Mary Rose" was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the <a href="foremast">foremast</a> and <a href="mainmast">mainmast</a> had two and three square sails respectively; the <a href="mizzen">mizzen</a> mast had a <a href="lateen">lateen</a> sail and a small square sail and the <a href="bonaventure%20mizzen">bonaventure mizzen</a> had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a> flew a small square <a href="spritsail%20%28square-rigged%29">spritsail</a>. According to the <a href="Anthony%20Roll">Anthony Roll</a> illustration (see top of this section), the <a href="yard%20%28sailing%29">yards</a> (the <a href="spar%20%28sailing%29">spars</a> from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.

The sailing capabilities of the "Mary Rose" were commented on by her contemporaries and were once even put to the test. In March 1513 a contest was arranged off <a href="The%20Downs%20%28ship%20anchorage%29">The Downs</a>, west of <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, in which she raced against nine other ships. She won the contest, and Admiral Edward Howard described her enthusiastically as "the noblest ship of sayle [of any] gret ship, at this howr, that I trow [believe] be in Cristendom". Several years later, while sailing between <a href="Dover">Dover</a> and The Downs, Vice-Admiral William Fitzwilliam noted that both the "Henry Grace à Dieu" and the "Mary Rose" performed very well, riding steadily in rough seas and that it would have been a "hard chose" between the two. Modern experts have been more sceptical to her sailing qualities, believing that ships at this time were almost incapable of sailing close against the wind, and describing the handling of the "Mary Rose" as being like "a wet haystack".

The "Mary Rose" represented a transitional ship design in naval warfare. Since ancient times, war at sea had been fought much like that on land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though the introduction of guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat. As guns became heavier and able to take more powerful gunpowder charges, they needed to be placed lower in the ship, closer to the water line. Gunports cut in the hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501, only about a decade before the "Mary Rose" was built. This made <a href="broadside">broadside</a>s, coordinated volleys from all the guns on one side of a ship, possible for the first time in history, at least in theory. Naval tactics throughout the 16th century and well into the 17th century focused on countering the oar-powered <a href="galley">galley</a>s that were armed with heavy guns in the bow, facing forwards, which were aimed by turning the entire ship against its target. Combined with inefficient gunpowder and the difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms, this meant that boarding remained the primary tactic for decisive victory throughout the 16th century.

As the "Mary Rose" was built and served during a period of rapid development of heavy artillery, her armament was a mix of old designs and innovations. The heavy armament was a mix of older-type wrought iron and cast bronze guns, which differed considerably in size, range and design. The large iron guns were made up of staves or bars welded into cylinders and then reinforced by shrinking iron hoops and <a href="breech%20loader">breech loaded</a>, from the back, and equipped with simpler <a href="gun-carriage">gun-carriage</a>s made from hollowed-out elm logs with only one pair of wheels, or without wheels entirely. The bronze guns were cast in one piece and rested on four-wheel carriages which were essentially the same as those used until the 19th century. The breech-loaders were cheaper to produce and both easier and faster to reload, but could take less powerful charges than cast bronze guns. Generally, the bronze guns used cast iron shot and were more suited to penetrate hull sides while the iron guns used stone shot that would shatter on impact and leave large, jagged holes, but both could also fire a variety of ammunition intended to destroy rigging and light structure or injure enemy personnel.

The majority of the guns were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by a single person. The two most common are the "bases", <a href="breech-loading%20swivel%20gun">breech-loading swivel gun</a>s, most likely placed in the castles, and "hailshot pieces", small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions that were used to support the guns against the railing and allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though the design is unknown, there were two "top pieces" in a <a href="Anthony%20Roll">1546 inventory</a> (finished after the sinking) which were probably similar to a base, but placed in one or more of the fighting tops.

The ship went through several changes in her armament throughout her career, most significantly accompanying her "rebuilding" in 1536 (see below), when the number of anti-personnel guns was reduced and a second tier of carriage-mounted long guns fitted. There are three inventories that list her guns, dating to 1514, 1540 and 1546. Together with records from the armoury at the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, these show how the configuration of guns changed as gun-making technology evolved and new classifications were invented. In 1514, the armament consisted mostly of anti-personnel guns like the larger breech-loading iron "murderers" and the small "serpentines", "demi-slings" and stone guns. Only a handful of guns in the first inventory were powerful enough to hole enemy ships, and most would have been supported by the ship's structure rather than resting on carriages. The inventories of both the "Mary Rose" and the Tower had changed radically by 1540. There were now the new cast bronze "cannons", "demi-cannons", "culverins" and "sakers" and the wrought iron "port pieces" (a name that indicated they fired through ports), all of which required carriages, had longer range and were capable of doing serious damage to other ships. The analysis of the 1514 inventory combined with hints of structural changes in the ship both indicate that the gunports on the main deck were indeed a later addition.

Various types of ammunition could be used for different purposes: plain spherical shot of stone or iron smashed hulls, spiked bar shot and shot linked with chains would tear sails or damage rigging, and <a href="canister%20shot">canister shot</a> packed with sharp flints produced a devastating <a href="shotgun">shotgun</a> effect. Trials made with replicas of culverins and port pieces showed that they could penetrate wood the same thickness of the "Mary Rose's" hull planking, indicating a stand-off range of at least 90 m (295 ft). The port pieces proved particularly efficient at smashing large holes in wood when firing stone shot and were a devastating anti-personnel weapon when loaded with flakes or pebbles.

To defend against being boarded, "Mary Rose" carried large stocks of melee weapons, including <a href="pike%20%28weapon%29">pikes</a> and <a href="bill%20%28weapon%29">bills</a>; 150 of each kind were stocked on the ship according to the <a href="Anthony%20Roll">Anthony Roll</a>, a figure confirmed roughly by the excavations. Swords and daggers were personal possessions and not listed in the inventories, but the remains of both have been found in great quantities, including the earliest dated example of a British <a href="basket-hilted%20sword">basket-hilted sword</a>.

A total of 250 <a href="longbow">longbow</a>s were carried on board, and 172 of these have so far been found, as well as almost 4,000 arrows, bracers (arm guards) and other archery-related equipment. Longbow archery in Tudor England was mandatory for all able adult men, and despite the introduction of field artillery and handguns, they were used alongside new missile weapons in great quantities. On the "Mary Rose", the longbows could only have been drawn and shot properly from behind protective panels in the open waist or from the top of the castles as the lower decks lacked sufficient headroom. There were several types of bows of various size and range. Lighter bows would have been used as "sniper" bows, while the heavier design could possibly have been used to shoot fire arrows.

The inventories of both 1514 and 1546 also list several hundred heavy darts and lime pots that were designed to be thrown onto the deck of enemy ships from the fighting tops, although no physical evidence of either of these weapon types has been identified. Of the 50 handguns listed in the Anthony Roll, the complete stocks of five <a href="matchlock">matchlock</a> <a href="musket">musket</a>s and fragments of another eleven have been found. They had been manufactured mainly in Italy, with some originating from Germany. Found in storage were several "gunshields", a rare type of firearm consisting of a wooden <a href="shield">shield</a> with a small gun fixed in the middle.

Throughout her 33-year career, the crew of the "Mary Rose" changed several times and varied considerably in size. It would have a minimal skeleton crew of 17 men or fewer in peacetime and when she was "<a href="laid%20up%20in%20ordinary">laid up in ordinary</a>" (in reserve). The average wartime manning would have been about 185 soldiers, 200 sailors, 20–30 gunners and an assortment of other specialists such as surgeons, trumpeters and members of the admiral's staff, for a total of 400–450 men. When taking part in land invasions or raids, such as in the summer of 1512, the number of soldiers could have swelled to just over 400 for a combined total of more than 700. Even with the normal crew size of around 400, the ship was quite crowded, and with additional soldiers would have been extremely cramped.
Little is known of the identities of the men who served on the "Mary Rose", even when it comes to the names of the officers, who would have belonged to the gentry. Two admirals and four captains (including <a href="Edward%20Howard%20%28admiral%29">Edward</a> and Thomas Howard, who served both positions) are known through records, as well as a few ship masters, <a href="purser">purser</a>s, master gunners and other specialists. Forensic science has been used by artists to create reconstructions of faces of eight crew members, and the results were publicised in May 2013. In addition, researchers have extracted DNA from remains in the hopes of identifying origins of crew, and potentially living descendants.

Of the vast majority of the crewmen, soldiers, sailors and gunners alike, nothing has been recorded. The only source of information for these men has been through <a href="osteology">osteological</a> analysis of the human bones found at the wrecksite. An approximate composition of some of the crew has been conjectured based on contemporary records. The "Mary Rose" would have carried a captain, a master responsible for navigation, and deck crew. There would also have been a purser responsible for handling payments, a <a href="boatswain">boatswain</a>, the captain's second in command, at least one carpenter, a pilot in charge of navigation, and a cook, all of whom had one or more assistants (mates). The ship was also staffed by a <a href="barber-surgeon">barber-surgeon</a> who tended to the sick and wounded, along with an apprentice or mate and possibly also a junior surgeon. The only positively identified person who went down with the ship was Vice-Admiral <a href="George%20Carew%20%28admiral%29">George Carew</a>. McKee, Stirland and several other authors have also named <a href="Roger%20Grenville">Roger Grenville</a>, father of <a href="Richard%20Grenville">Richard Grenville</a> of the Elizabethan-era "<a href="HMS%20Revenge%20%281577%29">Revenge</a>", captain during the final battle, although the accuracy of the sourcing for this has been disputed by maritime archaeologist Peter Marsden.

The bones of a total of 179 people were found during the excavations of the "Mary Rose", including 92 "fairly complete skeletons", more or less complete collections of bones associated with specific individuals. Analysis of these has shown that crew members were all male, most of them young adults. Some were no more than 11–13 years old, and the majority (81%) under 30. They were mainly of English origin and, according to archaeologist Julie Gardiner, they most likely came from the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a>; many following their aristocratic masters into maritime service. There were also a few people from continental Europe. An eyewitness testimony right after the sinking refers to a survivor who was a <a href="Flemish%20people">Fleming</a>, and the pilot may very well have been French. Analysis of oxygen <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s in teeth indicates that some were also of southern European origin. In general they were strong, well-fed men, but many of the bones also reveal tell-tale signs of childhood diseases and a life of grinding toil. The bones also showed traces of numerous healed fractures, probably the result of on-board accidents.

There are no extant written records of the make-up of the broader categories of soldiers and sailors, but since the "Mary Rose" carried some 300 longbows and several thousand arrows there had to be a considerable proportion of <a href="longbow">longbow</a> archers. Examination of the skeletal remains has found that there was a disproportionate number of men with a condition known as "<a href="os%20acromiale">os acromiale</a>", affecting their <a href="shoulder%20blade">shoulder blade</a>s. This condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable stress on the arm and shoulder muscles, particularly of the left arm that is used to hold the bow to brace against the pull on the bowstring. Among the men who died on the ship it was likely that some had practised using the longbow since childhood, and served on board as specialist archers.

A group of six skeletons was found grouped close to one of the 2-tonne bronze <a href="culverin">culverin</a>s on the main deck near the bow. Fusing of parts of the spine and <a href="ossification">ossification</a>, the growth of new bone, on several <a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a> evidenced all but one of these crewmen to have been strong, well-muscled men who had been engaged in heavy pulling and pushing, the exception possibly being a "<a href="powder%20monkey">powder monkey</a>" not involved in heavy work. These have been tentatively classified as members of a complete gun crew, all having died at their battle station.

The "Mary Rose" first saw battle in 1512, in a joint naval operation with the Spanish against the French. The English were to meet the French and Breton fleets in the English Channel while the Spanish attacked them in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a> and then attack <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a>. The 35-year-old Sir <a href="Edward%20Howard%20%28admiral%29">Edward Howard</a> was appointed Lord High Admiral in April and chose the "Mary Rose" as his <a href="flagship">flagship</a>. His first mission was to clear the seas of French naval forces between England to the northern coast of Spain to allow for the landing of supporting troops near the French border at <a href="Fuenterrabia">Fuenterrabia</a>. The fleet consisted of 18 ships, among them the large ships the "Regent" and the "Peter Pomegranate", carrying over 5,000 men. Howard's expedition led to the capture of twelve Breton ships and a four-day raiding tour of Brittany where English forces successfully fought against local forces and burned numerous settlements.

The fleet returned to Southampton in June where it was visited by King Henry. In August the fleet sailed for <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> where it encountered a joint, but ill-coordinated, French-Breton fleet at the <a href="battle%20of%20St.%20Mathieu">battle of St. Mathieu</a>. The English with one of the great ships in the lead (according to Marsden the "Mary Rose") battered the French ships with heavy gunfire and forced them to retreat. The Breton flagship "<a href="List%20of%20French%20early%20battleships">Cordelière</a>" put up a fight and was boarded by the 1,000-ton "Regent". By accident or through the unwillingness of the Breton crew to surrender, the powder magazine of the "Cordelière" caught fire and blew up in a violent explosion, setting fire to the "Regent" and eventually sinking her. About 180 English crew members saved themselves by throwing themselves into the sea and only a handful of Bretons survived, only to be captured. The captain of the "Regent", 600 soldiers and sailors, the High Admiral of France and the steward of the town of Morlaix were killed in the incident, making it the focal point of several contemporary chronicles and reports. On , the English burnt 27 French ships, captured another five and landed forces near Brest to raid and take prisoners, but storms forced the fleet back to <a href="Dartmouth%2C%20Devon">Dartmouth</a> in Devon and then to Southampton for repairs.
In the spring of 1513, the "Mary Rose" was once more chosen by Howard as the flagship for an expedition against the French. Before seeing action, she took part in a race against other ships where she was deemed to be one of the most nimble and the fastest of the great ships in the fleet (see details under "<a href="%23Sails%20and%20rigging">Sails and rigging</a>"). On , Howard's force arrived off Brest only to see a small enemy force join with the larger force in the safety of Brest harbour and its fortifications. The French had recently been reinforced by a force of galleys from the Mediterranean, which sank one English ship and seriously damaged another. Howard landed forces near Brest, but made no headway against the town and was by now getting low on supplies. Attempting to force a victory, he took a small force of small oared vessels on a daring frontal attack on the French galleys on . Howard himself managed to reach the ship of French admiral, <a href="Pr%C3%A9gent%20de%20Bidoux">Prégent de Bidoux</a>, and led a small party to board it. The French fought back fiercely and cut the cables that attached the two ships, separating Howard from his men. It left him at the mercy of the soldiers aboard the galley, who instantly killed him.

Demoralised by the loss of its admiral and seriously short of food, the fleet returned to <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>. <a href="Thomas%20Howard%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Thomas Howard</a>, elder brother of Edward, was assigned the new Lord Admiral, and was set to the task of arranging another attack on Brittany. The fleet was not able to mount the planned attack because of adverse winds and great difficulties in supplying the ships adequately and the "Mary Rose" took up winter quarters in Southampton. In August the Scots joined France in war against England, but were dealt a crushing defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Flodden">Battle of Flodden</a> on 1513. A follow-up attack in early 1514 was supported by a naval force that included the "Mary Rose", but without any known engagements. The French and English mounted raids on each other throughout that summer, but achieved little, and both sides were by then exhausted. By autumn the war was over and a peace treaty was sealed by the marriage of Henry's sister, <a href="Mary%20Tudor%20%28queen%20consort%20of%20France%29">Mary</a>, to French king <a href="Louis%20XII%20of%20France">Louis XII</a>.

After the peace "Mary Rose" was placed in the reserves, "in ordinary". She was laid up for maintenance along with her sister ship the "Peter Pomegranate" in July 1514. In 1518 she received a routine repair and <a href="caulking">caulking</a>, waterproofing with <a href="tar">tar</a> and <a href="oakum">oakum</a> (old rope fibres) and was then assigned a small skeleton crew who lived on board the ship until 1522. She served briefly on a mission with other warships to "scour the seas" in preparation for Henry VIII's journey across the <a href="English%20Channel">Channel</a> to the summit with the French king Francis I at the <a href="Field%20of%20the%20Cloth%20of%20Gold">Field of the Cloth of Gold</a> in June 1520.

In 1522, England was once again at war with France because of a treaty with the Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a>. The plan was for an attack on two fronts with an English thrust in northern France. The "Mary Rose" participated in the escort transport of troops in June 1522, and by the Breton port of <a href="Morlaix">Morlaix</a> was captured. The fleet sailed home and the "Mary Rose" berthed for the winter in Dartmouth. The war raged on until 1525 and saw the Scots join the French side. Though <a href="Charles%20Brandon%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Suffolk">Charles Brandon</a> came close to capturing Paris in 1523, there was little gained either against France or Scotland throughout the war. With the defeat of the French army and capture of Francis I by Charles V's forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pavia">Battle of Pavia</a> on 1525, the war was effectively over without any major gains or major victories for the English side.

The "Mary Rose" was kept in reserve from 1522 to 1545. She was once more caulked and repaired in 1527 in a newly dug dock at Portsmouth and her <a href="longboat">longboat</a> was repaired and trimmed. Little documentation about the "Mary Rose" between 1528 and 1539 exists. A document written by <a href="Thomas%20Cromwell">Thomas Cromwell</a> in 1536 specifies that the "Mary Rose" and six other ships were "made new" during his service under the king, though it is unclear which years he was referring to and what "made new" actually meant. A later document from January 1536 by an anonymous author states that the "Mary Rose" and other ships were "new made", and dating of timbers from the ship confirms some type of repair being done in 1535 or 1536. This would have coincided with the controversial <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries">dissolution of the monasteries</a> that resulted in a major influx of funds into the royal treasury. The nature and extent of this repair is unknown. Many experts, including <a href="Margaret%20Rule">Margaret Rule</a>, the project leader for the raising of the "Mary Rose", have assumed that it meant a complete rebuilding from clinker planking to carvel planking, and that it was only after 1536 that the ship took on the form that it had when it sank and that was eventually recovered in the 20th century. Marsden has speculated that it could even mean that the "Mary Rose" was originally built in a style that was closer to 15th-century ships, with a rounded, rather than square, stern and without the main deck gunports.

Henry's complicated marital situation and his high-handed dissolution of the monasteries angered the Pope and Catholic rulers throughout Europe, which increased England's diplomatic isolation. In 1544 Henry had agreed to attack France together with Emperor Charles V, and English forces captured <a href="Boulogne">Boulogne</a> at great cost in September, but soon England was left in the lurch after Charles had achieved his objectives and brokered a <a href="Italian%20War%20of%201542-1546%23Treaty%20of%20Cr%C3%A9py">separate peace</a>.

In May 1545, the French had assembled a large fleet in the estuary of the <a href="Seine">Seine</a> with the intent to <a href="French%20invasion%20of%20the%20Isle%20of%20Wight">land troops on English soil</a>. The estimates of the size of the fleet varied considerably; between 123 and 300 vessels according to French sources; and up to 226 sailing ships and galleys according to the chronicler <a href="Edward%20Hall">Edward Hall</a>. In addition to the massive fleet, 50,000 troops were assembled at Havre de Grâce (modern-day <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a>). An English force of 160 ships and 12,000 troops under <a href="John%20Dudley">Viscount Lisle</a> was ready at Portsmouth by early June, before the French were ready to set sail, and an ineffective pre-emptive strike was made in the middle of the month. In early July the huge French force under the command of Admiral <a href="Claude%20d%27Annebault">Claude d'Annebault</a> set sail for England and entered the Solent unopposed with 128 ships on . The English had around 80 ships with which to oppose the French, including the flagship "Mary Rose". But since they had virtually no heavy galleys, the vessels that were at their best in sheltered waters like the Solent, the English fleet promptly retreated into Portsmouth harbour.

The English were becalmed in port and unable to manoeuvre. On 1545, the French galleys advanced on the immobilised English fleet, and initially threatened to destroy a force of 13 small galleys, or "rowbarges", the only ships that were able to move against them without a wind. The wind picked up and the sailing ships were able to go on the offensive before the oared vessels were overwhelmed. Two of the largest ships, the "Henry Grace à Dieu" and the "Mary Rose", led the attack on the French galleys in the Solent.

Early in the battle something went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the "Mary Rose" suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports. The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble for the safety of the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the <a href="galley%20%28kitchen%29">galley</a> collapsed completely and the huge 360-litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above. Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.

For those who were not injured or killed outright by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The <a href="companionway">companionway</a>s that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.
Several accounts of the sinking have been preserved that describe the incident, but the only confirmed eyewitness account is the testimony of a surviving Flemish crewman written down by the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador <a href="Francis%20Van%20der%20Delft">François van der Delft</a> in a letter dated . According to the unnamed Fleming, the ship had fired all of its guns of one side and was turning to present the guns on the other side to the enemy ship, when she was caught in a strong gust of wind, heeled and took in water through the open gunports. In a letter to <a href="William%20Paget%2C%201st%20Baron%20Paget">William Paget</a> dated , former <a href="Admiralty">Lord High Admiral</a> <a href="John%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Bedford">John Russel</a> claimed that the ship had been lost because of "rechenes and great negligence". Three years after the sinking, the <a href="Edward%20Hall">Hall's Chronicle</a> gave the reason for the sinking as being caused by "to[o] much foly ... for she was laden with much ordinaunce, and the portes left open, which were low, & the great ordinaunce unbreached, so that when the ship should turne, the water entered, and sodainly she sanke."

Later accounts repeat the explanation that the ship heeled over while going about and that the ship was brought down because of the open gunports. A biography of <a href="Peter%20Carew">Peter Carew</a>, brother of George Carew, written by <a href="John%20Hooker%20%28English%20constitutionalist%29">John Hooker</a> sometime after 1575, gives the same reason for the sinking, but adds that insubordination among the crew was to blame. The biography claims that George Carew noted that the "Mary Rose" showed signs of instability as soon as her sails were raised. George's uncle <a href="Gawen%20Carew">Gawen Carew</a> had passed by with his own ship the "Matthew Gonson" during the battle to inquire about the situation of his nephew's ship. In reply he was told "that he had a sorte of knaves whom he could not rule". Contrary to all other accounts, <a href="Martin%20du%20Bellay">Martin du Bellay</a>, a French cavalry officer who was present at the battle, stated that the "Mary Rose" had been sunk by French guns.

The most common explanation for the sinking among modern historians is that the ship was unstable for a number of reasons. When a strong gust of wind hit the sails at a critical moment, the open gunports proved fatal, the ship flooded and quickly foundered. Coates offered a variant of this hypothesis, which explains why a ship which served for several decades without sinking, and which even fought in actions in the rough seas off Brittany, unexpectedly foundered: the ship had accumulated additional weight over the years in service and finally become unseaworthy. That the ship was turning after firing all the cannons on one side has been questioned by Marsden after examination of guns recovered in both the 19th and 20th centuries; guns from both sides were found still loaded. This has been interpreted to mean that something else could have gone wrong since it is assumed that an experienced crew would not have failed to secure the gunports before making a potentially risky turn.

The most recent surveys of the ship indicate that the ship was modified late in her career and have lent support to the idea that the "Mary Rose" was altered too much to be properly seaworthy. Marsden has suggested that the weight of additional heavy guns would have increased her <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> so much that the waterline was less than one metre (c. 3 feet) from the gunports on the main deck.

Peter Carew's claim of insubordination has been given support by James Watt, former Medical Director-General of the Royal Navy, based on records of an epidemic of <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> in Portsmouth which could have rendered the crew incapable of handling the ship properly, while historian Richard Barker has suggested that the crew actually knew that the ship was an accident waiting to happen, at which they balked and refused to follow orders. Marsden has noted that the Carew biography is in some details inconsistent with the sequence of events reported by both French and English eyewitnesses. It also reports that there were 700 men on board, an unusually high number. The distance in time to the event it describes may mean that it was embellished to add a dramatic touch. The report of French galleys sinking the "Mary Rose" as stated by Martin du Bellay has been described as "the account of a courtesan" by naval historian Maurice de Brossard. Du Bellay and his two brothers were close to king <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I</a> and du Bellay had much to gain from portraying the sinking as a French victory. English sources, even if biased, would have nothing to gain from portraying the sinking as the result of crew incompetence rather than conceding to a victory to the much-feared gun galleys.

Dominic Fontana, a geographer at the University of Portsmouth, has voiced support for du Bellay's version of the sinking based on the battle as it is depicted in the Cowdray Engraving, and modern <a href="GIS">GIS</a> analysis of the modern scene of the battle. By plotting the fleets and calculating the conjectured final manoeuvres of the "Mary Rose", Fontana reached the conclusion that the ship had been hit low in the hull by the galleys and was destabilised after taking in water. He has interpreted the final heading of the ship straight due north as a failed attempt to reach the shallows at <a href="Spitbank">Spitbank</a> only a few hundred metres away. This theory has been given partial support by Alexzandra Hildred, one of the experts who has worked with the "Mary Rose", though she has suggested that the close proximity to Spitbank could also indicate that the sinking occurred while trying to make a hard turn to avoid running aground.

In 2000, the <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> television programme "What Sank the Mary Rose?" attempted to investigate the causes suggested for her sinking by means of experiments with scale models of the ship and metal weights to simulate the presence of troops on the upper decks. Initial tests showed that the ship was able to make the turn described by eyewitnesses without capsizing. In later tests, a fan was used to create a breeze similar to the one reported to have suddenly sprung up on the day of the sinking as the "Mary Rose" went to make the turn. As the model made the turn, the breeze in the upper works forced it to heel more than at calm, forcing the main deck gun ports below the <a href="waterline">waterline</a> and foundering the model within a few seconds. The sequence of events closely followed what eyewitnesses had reported, particularly the suddenness with which the ship sank.

A salvage attempt was ordered by Secretary of State <a href="William%20Paget%2C%201st%20Baron%20Paget">William Paget</a> only days after the sinking, and <a href="Charles%20Brandon%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Suffolk">Charles Brandon</a>, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of practical details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two empty ships, or <a href="hulk%20%28ship%29">hulks</a>. At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with <a href="capstan%20%28nautical%29">capstans</a>. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.

A list of necessary equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, <a href="pulleys">pulleys</a>, and 40 pounds of <a href="tallow">tallow</a> for <a href="lubrication">lubrication</a>. The proposed salvage team comprised 30 Venetian mariners and a Venetian carpenter with 60 English sailors to serve them. The two ships to be used as hulks were "<a href="Jesus%20of%20L%C3%BCbeck">Jesus of Lübeck</a>" and "Samson", each of 700 tons burthen and similar in size to the "Mary Rose". Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the "Mary Rose". The optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60-degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.
The project was only successful in raising rigging, some guns and other items. At least two other salvage teams in 1547 and 1549 received payment for raising more guns from the wreck. Despite the failure of the first salvage operation, there was still lingering belief in the possibility of retrieving the "Mary Rose" at least until 1546, when she was presented as part of the illustrated list of English warships called the <a href="Anthony%20Roll">Anthony Roll</a>. When all hope of raising the complete ship was finally abandoned is not known. It could have been after Henry VIII's death in January 1547 or even as late as 1549, when the last guns were brought up. The "Mary Rose" was remembered well into the reign of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>, and according to one of the queen's admirals, <a href="William%20Monson%20%28admiral%29">William Monson</a> (1569–1643), the wreck was visible from the surface at low tide in the late 16th century.

After the sinking, the partially buried wreck created a barrier at a right angle against the currents of the Solent. Two scour pits, large underwater ditches, formed on either side of the wreck while silt and seaweed was deposited inside the ship. A deep but narrow pit formed on the upward tilting port side, while a shallower, broader pit formed on the starboard side, which had mostly been buried by the force of the impact. The abrasive actions of sand and silt carried by the currents and the activity of fungi, bacteria and wood-boring crustaceans and molluscs, such as the "<a href="Teredo%20navalis">teredo</a>" "shipworm", began to break down the structure of the ship. Eventually the exposed wooden structure was weakened and gradually collapsed. The timbers and contents of the port side were either deposited in the scour pits and remaining ship structure, or carried off by the currents. Following the collapse of the exposed parts of the ship, the site was levelled with the seabed and gradually covered by layers of sediment, concealing most of the remaining structure. During the 16th century, a hard layer of compacted clay and crushed shells formed over the ship, stabilising the site and sealing the Tudor-era deposits. Further layers of soft silt covered the site during the 18th and 19th centuries, but frequent changes in the tidal patterns and currents in the Solent occasionally exposed some of the timbers, leading to its accidental rediscovery in 1836 and aided in locating the wreck in 1971. After the ship had been raised it was determined that about 40% of the original structure had survived.

In the summer of 1836, a group of five fishermen caught their nets on timbers protruding from the bottom of the Solent. They contacted a diver to help them remove the hindrance, and on , <a href="Henry%20Abbinett">Henry Abbinett</a> became the first person to see the "Mary Rose" in almost 300 years. Later, two other professional divers, <a href="John%20Deane%20%28inventor%29">John Deane</a> and William Edwards, were employed. Using a recently invented rubber suit and metal diving helmet, Deane and Edwards began to examine the wreck and salvage items from it. Along with an assortment of timbers and wooden objects, including several longbows, they brought up several bronze and iron guns, which were sold to the <a href="Board%20of%20Ordnance">Board of Ordnance</a> for over £220. Initially, this caused a dispute between Deane (who had also brought in his brother Charles into the project), Abbinett and the fishermen who had hired them. The matter was eventually settled by allowing the fishermen a share of the proceeds from the sale of the first salvaged guns, while Deane received exclusive salvage rights at the expense of Abbinett. The wreck was soon identified as the "Mary Rose" from the inscriptions of one of the bronze guns manufactured in 1537.
The identification of the ship led to significant public interest in the salvage operation, and caused a great demand for the objects which were brought up. Though many of the objects could not be properly conserved at the time and subsequently deteriorated, many were documented with pencil sketches and watercolour drawings which survive to this day. John Deane ceased working on the wreck in 1836, but returned in 1840 with new, more destructive methods. With the help of condemned bomb shells filled with gunpowder acquired from the Ordnance Board, he blasted his way into parts of the wreck. Fragments of bombs and traces of blasting craters were found during the modern excavations, but there was no evidence that Deane managed to penetrate the hard layer that had sealed off the Tudor levels. Deane reported retrieving a <a href="bilge%20pump">bilge pump</a> and the lower part of the main mast, both of which would have been located inside the ship. The recovery of small wooden objects like longbows suggests that Deane did manage to penetrate the Tudor levels at some point, though this has been disputed by the excavation project leader <a href="Margaret%20Rule">Margaret Rule</a>. Newspaper reports on Deane's diving operations in October 1840 report that the ship was clinker built, but since the sterncastle is the only part of the ship with this feature, an alternative explanation has been suggested: Deane did not penetrate the hard shelly layer that covered most of the ship, but only managed to get into remains of the sterncastle that today no longer exist. Despite the rough handling by Deane, the "Mary Rose" escaped the wholesale destruction by giant rakes and explosives that was the fate of other wrecks in the Solent.

The modern search for the "Mary Rose" was initiated by the Southsea branch of the <a href="British%20Sub-Aqua%20Club">British Sub-Aqua Club</a> in 1965 as part of a project to locate shipwrecks in the Solent. The project was under the leadership of historian, journalist and amateur diver <a href="Alexander%20McKee%20%28author%29">Alexander McKee</a>. Another group led by Lieutenant-Commander <a href="Alan%20Bax">Alan Bax</a> of the Royal Navy, sponsored by the Committee for Nautical Archaeology in London, also formed a search team. Initially the two teams had differing views on where to find the wreck, but eventually joined forces. In February 1966 a chart from 1841 was found that marked the positions of the "Mary Rose" and several other wrecks. The charted position coincided with a trench (one of the scour pits) that had already been located by McKee's team, and a definite location was finally established at a position 3 km (1.9 mi) south of the entrance to <a href="Portsmouth%20Harbour">Portsmouth Harbour</a> () in water with a depth of (36 feet) at low tide. Diving on the site began in 1966 and a sonar scan by <a href="Harold%20Edgerton">Harold Edgerton</a> in 1967–68 revealed some type of buried feature. In 1970 a loose timber was located and on 1971, the first structural details of the buried hull were identified after they were partially uncovered by winter storms.

A major problem for the team from the start was that wreck sites in the UK lacked any legal protection from plunderers and treasure hunters. Sunken ships, once being moving objects, were legally treated as <a href="Personal%20property">chattel</a> and were awarded to those who could first raise them. The <a href="Merchant%20Shipping%20Act">Merchant Shipping Act</a> of 1894 also stipulated that any objects raised from a wreck should be auctioned off to finance the salvage operations, and there was nothing preventing anyone from "stealing" the wreck and making a profit. The problem was handled by forming an organisation, the Mary Rose Committee, aiming "to find, excavate, raise and preserve for all time such remains of the ship "Mary Rose" as may be of historical or archaeological interest".

To keep intruders at bay, the Committee arranged a lease of the seabed where the wreck lay from the Portsmouth authorities, thereby discouraging anyone from trespassing on the underwater property. In hindsight this was only a legalistic charade which had little chance of holding up in a court of law. In combination with secrecy as to the exact location of the wreck, it saved the project from interference. It was not until the passing of the <a href="Protection%20of%20Wrecks%20Act">Protection of Wrecks Act</a> on 1973 that the "Mary Rose" was declared to be of national historic interest that enjoyed full legal protection from any disturbance by commercial salvage teams. Despite this, years after the passing of the 1973 act and the excavation of the ship, lingering conflicts with salvage legislation remained a threat to the "Mary Rose" project as "personal" finds such as chests, clothing and cooking utensils risked being confiscated and auctioned off.

Following the discovery of the wreck in 1971, the project became known to the general public and received increasing media attention. This helped bring in more donations and equipment, primarily from private sources. By 1974 the Committee had representatives from the <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> and local organisations. In 1974 the project received royal patronage from <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a>, who participated in dives on the site. This attracted yet more publicity, and also more funding and assistance. The initial aims of the Mary Rose Committee were now more officially and definitely confirmed. The Committee had become a registered charity in 1974, which made it easier to raise funds, and the application for excavation and raising of the ship had been officially approved by the UK government.

By 1978 the initial excavation work had uncovered a complete and coherent site with an intact ship structure and the orientation of the hull had been positively identified as being on an almost straight northerly heading with a 60-degree heel to starboard and a slight downward tilt towards the bow. As no records of English shipbuilding techniques used in vessels like the "Mary Rose" survive, excavation of the ship would allow for a detailed survey of her design and shed new light on the construction of ships of the era. A full excavation also meant removing the protective layers of silt that prevented the remaining ship structure from being destroyed through biological decay and the scouring of the currents; the operation had to be completed within a predetermined timespan of a few years or it risked irreversible damage. It was also considered desirable to recover and preserve the remains of the hull if possible. For the first time, the project was faced with the practical difficulties of actually raising, conserving and preparing the hull for public display.

To handle this new, considerably more complex and expensive task, it was decided that a new organisation was needed. The <a href="Mary%20Rose%20Trust">Mary Rose Trust</a>, a <a href="charitable%20organization">limited charitable trust</a>, with representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12 m (40 ft) catamaran "Roger Greenville" which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel "Sleipner", the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the "Vasa". The project went from a team of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8-man-years.

Raising the "Mary Rose" meant overcoming a number of delicate problems that had never been encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship "<a href="Vasa%20%28ship%29">Vasa</a>" 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons on either side of the ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the "Mary Rose" was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a <a href="cofferdam">cofferdam</a> around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating <a href="sheerleg">sheerleg</a>s attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.

During the last year of the operation, the massive scope of full excavation and raising was beginning to take its toll on those closely involved in the project. In May 1981, <a href="Alexander%20McKee%20%28author%29">Alexander McKee</a> voiced concerns about the method chosen for raising the timbers and openly questioned <a href="Margaret%20Rule">Margaret Rule</a>'s position as excavation leader. McKee felt ignored in what he viewed as a project where he had always played a central role, both as the initiator of the search for the "Mary Rose" and other ships in the Solent, and as an active member throughout the diving operations. He had several supporters who all pointed to the risk of the project's turning into an embarrassing failure if the ship were damaged during raising operations. To address these concerns it was suggested that the hull should be placed on top of a supporting steel cradle underwater. This would avoid the inherent risks of damaging the wooden structure if it were lifted out of the water without appropriate support. The idea of using nylon strops was also discarded in favour of drilling holes through the hull at 170 points and passing iron bolts through them to allow the attachment of wires connected to a lifting frame.

In the spring of 1982, after three intense seasons of archaeological underwater work, preparations began for raising the ship. The operation soon ran into problems: early on there were difficulties with the custom-made lifting equipment; divers on the project belonging to the Royal Engineers had to be pulled because of the outbreak of the <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a>; and the method of lifting the hull had to be considerably altered as late as June. After the frame was properly attached to the hull it was slowly jacked up on four legs straddling the wreck site to pull the ship off the seabed. The massive crane of the barge "Tog Mor" was then used to lift the frame and hull on to the specially designed cradle which was padded with water-filled bags. On the morning of 1982, the final lift of the entire package of cradle, hull and lifting frame began. At 9:03 the first timbers of the "Mary Rose" broke the surface in the presence of the team, Prince Charles and curious spectators on boats circling the site. A second set of bags under the hull was inflated with air to cushion the waterlogged wood and finally the whole package was transferred to the barge that would take the hull ashore. Though eventually successful, the operation was close to floundering on two occasions; first when one of the supporting legs of the lifting frame was bent and had to be removed and later when a corner of the frame, with "an unforgettable crunch", slipped more than a metre (3 feet) and came close to crushing part of the hull.

As one of the most ambitious and expensive projects in the history of <a href="maritime%20archaeology">maritime archaeology</a>, the "Mary Rose" project broke new ground within this field in the UK. Besides becoming one of the first wrecks to be protected under the new <a href="Protection%20of%20Wrecks%20Act">Protection of Wrecks Act</a> in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It was the first time that a British privately funded project was able to apply modern scientific standards fully and without having to auction off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often had to settle for just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with the "Mary Rose" was recovered and recorded. The raising of the vessel made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of the "Mary Rose" wreck site proved that it was possible to achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable to those on dry land.

Throughout the 1970s, the "Mary Rose" was meticulously surveyed, excavated and recorded with the latest methods within the field of maritime archaeology. Working in an underwater environment meant that principles of land-based archaeology did not always apply. Mechanical excavators, <a href="Airlift%20%28dredging%20device%29">airlifts</a> and suction dredges were used in the process of locating the wreck, but as soon as it began to be uncovered in earnest, more delicate techniques were employed. Many objects from the "Mary Rose" had been well preserved in form and shape, but many were quite delicate, requiring careful handling. Artefacts of all sizes were supported with soft packing material, such as old plastic ice cream containers, and some of the arrows that were "soft like cream cheese" had to be brought up in special styrofoam containers. The airlifts that sucked up clay, sand and dirt off-site or to the surface were still used, but with much greater precision since they could potentially disrupt the site. The many layers of sediment that had accumulated on the site could be used to date artefacts in which they were found, and had to be recorded properly. The various types of accretions and remnants of chemicals with artefacts were essential clues to objects that had long since broken down and disappeared, and needed to be treated with considerable care.

The excavation and raising of the ship in the 1970s and early 1980s meant that diving operations ceased, even though modern scaffolding and part of the bow were left on the seabed. The pressure on conservators to treat tens of thousands of artefacts and the high costs of conserving, storing and displaying the finds and the ship meant that there were no funds available for diving. In 2002, the UK Ministry of Defence announced plans to build two new <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s. Because of the massive size of the new vessels, the outlet from Portsmouth needed to be surveyed to make sure that they could sail no matter the tide. The planned route for the underwater channel ran close to the "Mary Rose" wrecksite, which meant that funding was supplied to survey and excavate the site once more. Even though the planned carriers were down-sized enough to not require alteration of Portsmouth outlet, the excavations had already exposed timbers and were completed in 2005. Among the most important finds was the ten-metre (32 feet) <a href="stem%20%28ship%29">stem</a>, the forward continuation of the keel, which provided more exact details about the original profile of the ship.

Over 26,000 artefacts and pieces of timber were raised along with remains of about half the crew members, The faces of some crew members have been reconstructed. Analysis of the crew <a href="Human%20skeleton">skeletons</a> shows many had suffered <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a>, and had evidence of <a href="rickets">rickets</a>, <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>, and other deficiency diseases. Crew members also developed <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a> through the stresses on their joints from heavy lifting and maritime life generally, and suffered <a href="bone%20fracture">bone fracture</a>s.

As the ship was intended to function as a floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with <a href="victuals">victuals</a> (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The <a href="cask">cask</a>s used for storage on the "Mary Rose" have been compared with those from a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the <a href="Tudor%20navy">Tudor navy</a> were given high priority, and their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time.

As a miniature society at sea, the wreck of the "Mary Rose" held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing. The master <a href="carpenter">carpenter</a>'s chest, for example, contained a <a href="backgammon">backgammon</a> set, a book, three plates, a <a href="sundial">sundial</a>, and a <a href="tankard">tankard</a>, goods suggesting he was relatively wealthy.

The ship carried several skilled craftsmen and was equipped for handling both routine maintenance and repairing extensive battle damage. In and around one of the cabins on the main deck under the sterncastle, archaeologists found a "collection of woodworking tools ... unprecedented in its range and size", consisting of eight chests of carpentry tools. Along with loose mallets and tar pots used for caulking, this variety of tools belonged to one or several of the carpenters employed on the "Mary Rose".

Many of the cannons and other weapons from the "Mary Rose" have provided invaluable physical evidence about 16th-century weapon technology. The surviving gunshields are almost all from the "Mary Rose", and the four small cast iron hailshot pieces are the only known examples of this type of weapon.

Animal remains have been found in the wreck of the "Mary Rose". These include the <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>s of a rat, a frog and a dog. The dog, a mongrel between eighteen months and two years in age, was found near the hatch to the ship's carpenter's cabin and is thought to have been brought aboard as a ratter. Nine barrels have been found to contain bones of cattle, indicating that they contained pieces of beef butchered and stored as ship's rations. The bones of pigs and fish, stored in baskets, have also been found.

Two <a href="fiddle">fiddle</a>s, a bow, a still <a href="shawm">shawm</a> or "doucaine", three <a href="three-hole%20pipe">three-hole pipe</a>s, and a <a href="Tabor%20%28instrument%29">tabor drum</a> with a drumstick were found throughout the wreck. These would have been used for the personal enjoyment of the crew and to provide a rhythm to work on the rigging and turning the <a href="capstan%20%28nautical%29">capstans</a> on the upper decks. The tabor drum is the earliest known example of its kind and the drumstick of a previously unknown design. The tabor pipes are considerably longer than any known examples from the period. Their discovery proved that contemporary illustrations, previously viewed with some suspicion, were in fact accurate depictions of the instruments. Before the discovery of the "Mary Rose" shawm, an early predecessor to the <a href="oboe">oboe</a>, instrument historians had been puzzled by reference to "still shawms", or "soft" shawms, that were said to have a sound that was less shrill than earlier shawms. The still shawm disappeared from the musical scene some time in the 16th century, and the instrument found on the "Mary Rose" is the only surviving example. A reproduction has been made and played. Combined with a pipe and tabor, it provides a "very effective bass part" that would have produced "rich and full sound, which would have provided excellent music for dancing on board ship". Only a few other fiddle-type instruments from the 16th century exist, but none of them of the type found on the "Mary Rose". Reproductions of both fiddles have been made, though less is known of their design than the shawm since the neck and strings were missing.

In the remains of a small cabin in the bow of the ship and in a few other locations around the wreck was found the earliest dated set of navigation instruments in Europe found so far: compasses, <a href="divider%20caliper">divider caliper</a>s, a stick used for charting, <a href="protractor">protractor</a>s, <a href="sounding%20lead">sounding lead</a>s, tide calculators and a <a href="logreel">logreel</a>, an instrument for calculating speed. Several of these objects are not only unique in having such an early, definite dating, but also because they pre-date written records of their use; protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps, but sea charts are not known to have been used by English navigators during the first half of the 16th century, compasses were not depicted on English ships until the 1560s, and the first mention of a logreel is from 1574.

The cabin located on the main deck underneath the sterncastle is thought to have belonged to the <a href="barber-surgeon">barber-surgeon</a>. He was a trained professional who saw to the health and welfare of the crew and acted as the medical expert on board. The most important of these finds were found in an intact wooden chest which contained over 60 objects relating to the barber-surgeon's medical practice: the wooden handles of a complete set of surgical tools and several shaving razors (although none of the steel blades had survived), a copper syringe for wound irrigation and treatment of <a href="gonorrhoea">gonorrhoea</a>, and even a skilfully crafted feeding bottle for feeding incapacitated patients. More objects were found around the cabin, such as earscoops, shaving bowls and combs. With this wide selection of tools and medicaments the barber-surgeon, along with one or more assistants, could set bone fractures, perform amputations and deal with other acute injuries, treat a number of diseases and provide crew members with a minimal standard of personal hygiene.

Preservation of the "Mary Rose" and her contents was an essential part of the project from the start. Though many artefacts, especially those that were buried in silt, had been preserved, the long exposure to an underwater environment had rendered most of them sensitive to exposure to air after recovery. Archaeologists and conservators had to work in tandem from the start to prevent deterioration of the artefacts. After recovery, finds were placed in so-called passive storage, which would prevent any immediate deterioration before the active conservation which would allow them to be stored in an open-air environment. Passive storage depended on the type of material that the object was made of, and could vary considerably. Smaller objects from the most common material, wood, were sealed in polyethylene bags to preserve moisture. Timbers and other objects that were too large to be wrapped were stored in unsealed water tanks. Growth of fungi and microbes that could degrade wood were controlled by various techniques, including low-temperature storage, chemicals, and in the case of large objects, common <a href="pond%20snail">pond snail</a>s that consumed wood-degrading organisms but not the wood itself.

Other organic materials such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was <a href="desalinization">desalinated</a> to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a <a href="sodium%20sesquicarbonate">sodium sesquicarbonate</a> solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the <a href="chloride">chloride</a>s that had penetrated the surface. Alloys of lead and pewter are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.
Conserving the hull of the "Mary Rose" was the most complicated and expensive task for the project. In 2002 a donation of from the <a href="Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund">Heritage Lottery Fund</a> and equivalent monetary support from the Portsmouth City and Hampshire County Councils was needed to keep the work with conservation on schedule. During passive conservation, the ship structure could for practical reasons not be completely sealed, so instead it was regularly sprayed with filtered, recycled water that was kept at a temperature of 2 to 5 °C (35 to 41 °F) to keep it from drying out. Drying waterlogged wood that has been submerged for several centuries without appropriate conservation causes considerable shrinkage (20–50%) and leads to severe warping and cracking as water evaporates from the cellular structure of the wood. The substance <a href="polyethylene%20glycol">polyethylene glycol</a> (PEG) had been used before on archaeological wood, and was during the 1980s being used to conserve the "<a href="Vasa%20%28ship%29">Vasa</a>". After almost ten years of small-scale trials on timbers, an active three-phase conservation programme of the hull of the "Mary Rose" began in 1994. During the first phase, which lasted from 1994 to 2003, the wood was sprayed with low-molecular-weight PEG to replace the water in the cellular structure of the wood. From 2003 to 2010, a higher-molecular-weight PEG was used to strengthen the mechanical properties of the outer surface layers. The third phase consisted of a controlled air drying ending in 2016. Researchers are planning on using magnetic <a href="nanoparticle">nanoparticle</a>s to remove iron in the ship's wood to reduce the production of harmful <a href="sulphuric%20acid">sulphuric acid</a> that is causing deterioration.

After the decision to raise the "Mary Rose," discussions ensued as to where she would eventually go on permanent display. The east end of <a href="Portsea%20Island">Portsea Island</a> at <a href="Eastney">Eastney</a> emerged as an early alternative, but was rejected because of parking problems and the distance from the dockyard where she was originally built. Placing the ship next to the famous flagship of <a href="Horatio%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>, <a href="HMS%20Victory">HMS "Victory"</a>, at <a href="Portsmouth%20Historic%20Dockyard">Portsmouth Historic Dockyard</a> was proposed in July 1981. A group called the Maritime Preservation Society even suggested <a href="Southsea%20Castle">Southsea Castle</a>, where Henry VIII had witnessed the sinking, as a final resting place and there was widespread scepticism to the dockyard location. At one point a county councillor even threatened to withdraw promised funds if the dockyard site became more than an interim solution. As costs for the project mounted, there was a debate in the Council chamber and in the local paper "<a href="Portsmouth%20News">The News</a>" as to whether the money could be spent more appropriately. Although author David Childs writes that in the early 1980s "the debate was as a fiery one", the project was never seriously threatened because of the great symbolic importance of the "Mary Rose" to the naval history of both Portsmouth and England.

Since the mid-1980s, the hull of the "Mary Rose" has been kept in a covered dry dock while undergoing conservation. Although the hull has been open to the public for viewing, the need for keeping the ship saturated first with water and later a <a href="polyethylene%20glycol">polyethylene glycol</a> (PEG) solution meant that, before 2013, visitors were separated from the hull by a glass barrier. By 2007, the specially built ship hall had been visited by over seven million visitors since it first opened on 1983, just under a year after it was successfully raised.

A separate <a href="Mary%20Rose%20Museum">Mary Rose Museum</a> was housed in a structure called No. 5 Boathouse near the ship hall and was opened to the public on 1984. containing displays explaining the history of the ship and a small number of conserved artefacts, from entire bronze cannons to household items. In September 2009 the temporary "Mary Rose" display hall was closed to visitors to facilitate construction of the new museum building, which opened to the public on 31 May 2013.

The new <a href="Mary%20Rose%20Museum">Mary Rose Museum</a> was designed by architects Wilkinson Eyre, <a href="Perkins%20and%20Will">Perkins+Will</a> and built by construction firm Warings. The construction has been challenging because the museum has been built over the ship in the dry dock which is a listed monument. During construction of the museum, conservation of the hull continued inside a sealed "hotbox". In April 2013 the <a href="polyethylene%20glycol">polyethylene glycol</a> sprays were turned off and the process of controlled airdrying began. In 2016 the "hotbox" was removed and for the first time since 1545, the ship was revealed dry. This new museum displays most of the artefacts recovered from within the ship in context with the conserved hull. Since opening it has been visited by over 500,000 people.

Maple syrup

Maple syrup is a <a href="syrup">syrup</a> usually made from the <a href="xylem">xylem</a> <a href="sap">sap</a> of <a href="sugar%20maple">sugar maple</a>, <a href="red%20maple">red maple</a>, or <a href="black%20maple">black maple</a> trees, although it can also be made from other <a href="maple">maple</a> species. In cold climates, these trees store <a href="starch">starch</a> in their trunks and roots before winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.

Maple syrup was first collected and used by the <a href="indigenous%20peoples%20of%20North%20America">indigenous peoples of North America</a>, and the practice was adopted by European settlers, who gradually refined production methods. Technological improvements in the 1970s further refined syrup processing. The Canadian province of <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> is by far the largest producer, responsible for 70 percent of the world's output; Canadian exports of maple syrup in 2016 were <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a> 487 million (about <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a> 360 million), with Quebec accounting for some 90 percent of this total.

Maple syrup is graded according to the Canada, United States, or Vermont scales based on its density and translucency. <a href="Sucrose">Sucrose</a> is the most prevalent sugar in maple syrup. In Canada, syrups must be made exclusively from maple sap to qualify as maple syrup and must also be at least 66 percent sugar. In the United States, a syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap to be labelled as "maple", though states such as Vermont and <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> have more restrictive definitions.

Maple syrup is often used as a condiment for <a href="pancake">pancake</a>s, <a href="waffle">waffle</a>s, <a href="French%20toast">French toast</a>, <a href="oatmeal">oatmeal</a> or <a href="porridge">porridge</a>. It is also used as an ingredient in <a href="baking">baking</a> and as a sweetener or flavouring agent. Culinary experts have praised its unique flavour, although the chemistry responsible is not fully understood.

Three species of maple trees are predominantly used to produce maple syrup: the <a href="Acer%20saccharum">sugar maple ("Acer saccharum")</a>, the <a href="Acer%20nigrum">black maple ("A. nigrum")</a>, and the <a href="Acer%20rubrum">red maple ("A. rubrum")</a>, because of the high sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species. The black maple is included as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> or <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> in a more broadly viewed concept of "A. saccharum", the sugar maple, by some botanists. Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavour of the sap.

A few other (but not all) species of <a href="Acer%20%28genus%29">maple ("Acer")</a> are also sometimes used as sources of sap for producing maple syrup, including the <a href="Acer%20negundo">box elder or Manitoba maple ("Acer negundo")</a>, the <a href="Acer%20saccharinum">silver maple ("A. saccharinum")</a>, and the <a href="Acer%20macrophyllum">bigleaf maple ("A. macrophyllum")</a>. Similar syrups may also be produced from walnut, <a href="birch%20syrup">birch</a> or <a href="palm%20syrup">palm</a> trees, among other sources.

<a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indigenous peoples</a> living in northeastern North America were the first groups known to have produced maple syrup and maple sugar. According to aboriginal oral traditions, as well as archaeological evidence, maple tree sap was being processed into syrup long before Europeans arrived in the region. There are no authenticated accounts of how maple syrup production and consumption began, but various legends exist; one of the most popular involves maple sap being used in place of water to cook <a href="venison">venison</a> served to a chief. Other stories credit the development of maple syrup production to <a href="Nanabozho">Nanabozho</a>, <a href="Glooskap">Glooskap</a>, or the <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>. Aboriginal tribes developed rituals around sugar-making, celebrating the Sugar Moon (the first <a href="full%20moon">full moon</a> of <a href="spring%20%28season%29">spring</a>) with a Maple Dance. Many aboriginal dishes replaced the salt traditional in European cuisine with maple sugar or syrup.

The <a href="Algonquian%20peoples">Algonquian</a>s recognized maple sap as a source of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they used <a href="stone%20tool">stone tool</a>s to make V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into buckets, which were often made from birch bark. The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot <a href="Outdoor%20cooking">cooking stone</a>s into the buckets or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of <a href="fractional%20freezing">the layer of ice</a> that formed on top.

In the early stages of European colonization in northeastern North America, local Indigenous peoples showed the arriving colonists how to tap the trunks of certain types of maples during the spring thaw to harvest the sap. <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Thevet">André Thevet</a>, the "Royal Cosmographer of France", wrote about <a href="Jacques%20Cartier">Jacques Cartier</a> drinking maple sap during his Canadian voyages. By 1680, European settlers and <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>rs were involved in harvesting maple products. However, rather than making incisions in the bark, the Europeans used the method of drilling tapholes in the trunks with <a href="auger%20%28drill%29">auger</a>s. During the 17th and 18th centuries, processed maple sap was used primarily as a source of concentrated sugar, in both liquid and crystallized-solid form, as <a href="cane%20sugar">cane sugar</a> had to be imported from the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>.

Maple sugaring parties typically began to operate at the start of the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples. Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment's core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container. Sap filled the buckets, and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels (barrels, large pots, or hollowed-out wooden logs), often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by <a href="draft%20animal">draft animal</a>s, or carried in buckets or other convenient containers. The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees, and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained "sweet". The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the sugaring season. As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.

The boiling process was very time-consuming. The harvested sap was transported back to the party's base camp, where it was then poured into large vessels (usually made from metal) and boiled to achieve the desired consistency. The sap was usually transported using large barrels pulled by horses or oxen to a central collection point, where it was processed either over a fire built out in the open or inside a shelter built for that purpose (the "sugar shack").

Around the time of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> (1861-1865), syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more efficient for boiling than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased boiling time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of <a href="flue">flue</a>s, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased boiling time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.

Buckets began to be replaced with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>, <a href="propane">propane</a>, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.

A large number of technological changes took place during the 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since the early part of the century were perfected, and the sap came directly from the tree to the evaporator house. <a href="Vacuum%20pump">Vacuum pump</a>s were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed <a href="reverse-osmosis">reverse-osmosis</a> machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.

Improvements in tubing and vacuum pumps, new filtering techniques, "supercharged" preheaters, and better storage containers have since been developed. Research continues on pest control and improved woodlot management. In 2009, researchers at the <a href="University%20of%20Vermont">University of Vermont</a> unveiled a new type of tap that prevents backflow of sap into the tree, reducing <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>l contamination and preventing the tree from attempting to heal the bore hole. Experiments show that it may be possible to use saplings in a plantation instead of mature trees, dramatically boosting productivity per acre.

Open pan evaporation methods have been streamlined since colonial days, but remain basically unchanged. Sap must first be collected and boiled down to obtain pure syrup without chemical agents or preservatives. Maple syrup is made by boiling between 20 and 50 volumes of sap (depending on its concentration) over an open fire until 1 volume of syrup is obtained, usually at a temperature over the boiling point of water. As the boiling point of water varies with changes in air pressure the correct value for pure water is determined at the place where the syrup is being produced, each time evaporation is begun and periodically throughout the day. Syrup can be boiled entirely over one heat source or can be drawn off into smaller batches and boiled at a more controlled temperature.

Boiling the syrup is a tightly controlled process, which ensures appropriate sugar content. Syrup boiled too long will eventually crystallize, whereas under-boiled syrup will be watery, and will quickly spoil. The finished syrup has a <a href="density">density</a> of 66° on the <a href="Brix%23">Brix scale</a> (a <a href="hydrometer">hydrometric</a> scale used to measure sugar solutions). The syrup is then filtered to remove <a href="sugar%20sand">sugar sand</a>, crystals made up largely of sugar and <a href="calcium%20malate">calcium malate</a>. These crystals are not toxic, but create a "gritty" texture in the syrup if not filtered out.

In addition to open pan evaporation methods, many large producers use the more fuel efficient <a href="reverse%20osmosis">reverse osmosis</a> procedure to separate the water from the sap.

The higher the sugar content of the sap, the smaller the volume of sap is needed to obtain the same amount of syrup. 57 units of sap with 1.5 percent sugar content will yield 1 unit of syrup, but only 25 units of sap with a 3.5 percent sugar content are needed to obtain one unit of syrup. The sap's sugar content is highly variable and will fluctuate even within the same tree.

The filtered syrup is graded and packaged while still hot, usually at a temperature of or greater. The containers are turned over after being sealed to sterilize the cap with the hot syrup. Packages can be made of metal, glass, or coated plastic, depending on volume and target market. The syrup can also be heated longer and further processed to create a variety of other maple products, including <a href="maple%20sugar">maple sugar</a>, <a href="maple%20butter">maple butter or cream</a>, and <a href="maple%20taffy">maple candy or taffy</a>.

<a href="Off-flavours">Off-flavours</a> can sometimes develop during the production of maple syrup, resulting from contaminants in the boiling apparatus (such as <a href="disinfectant">disinfectant</a>s), <a href="microorganisms">microorganisms</a>, <a href="fermentation%20%28food%29">fermentation</a> products, <a href="metal">metal</a>lic can flavours, and "buddy sap", an off-flavour occurring late in the syrup season when tree <a href="budding">budding</a> has begun. In some circumstances, it is possible to remove off-flavours through processing.

Maple syrup production is centred in northeastern North America; however, given the correct weather conditions, it can be made wherever suitable species of maple trees grow.

A maple syrup production farm is called a "<a href="sugar%20bush">sugarbush</a>" or "sugarwood". Sap is often boiled in a "<a href="sugar%20house">sugar house</a>" (also known as a "sugar shack", "sugar shanty", or "cabane à sucre"), a building <a href="louver">louver</a>ed at the top to vent the steam from the boiling sap.

Maples are usually tapped beginning at 30 to 40 years of age. Each tree can support between one and three taps, depending on its trunk diameter. The average maple tree will produce of sap per season, up to per day. This is roughly equal to seven percent of its total sap. Seasons last for four to eight weeks, depending on the weather. During the day, starch stored in the roots for the winter rises through the trunk as sugary sap, allowing it to be tapped. Sap is not tapped at night because the temperature drop inhibits sap flow, although taps are typically left in place overnight. Some producers also tap in autumn, though this practice is less common than spring tapping. Maples can continue to be tapped for sap until they are over 100 years old.

Until the 1930s, the United States produced most of the world's maple syrup. Today, after rapid growth in the 1990s, <a href="Canada">Canada</a> produces more than 80 percent of the world's maple syrup, producing about in 2016. The vast majority of this comes from the province of <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, which is the world's largest producer, with about 70 percent of global production. Canada exported more than <a href="C%24">C$</a>362 million of maple syrup in 2016. In 2015, 64 percent of Canadian maple syrup exports went to the United States (a value of C$229 million), 8 percent to Germany (C$31 million), 6 percent to Japan (C$26 million), and 5 percent to the United Kingdom (C$16 million).

In 2015, Quebec accounts for 90.83 percent of maple syrup produced in Canada, followed by <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> at 4.83 percent, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> at 4.14 percent, and <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> at 0.2 percent. However, 94.28 percent of exported Canadian maple syrup originated from Quebec, whereas 4.91 percent of exported syrup originated from New Brunswick, and the remaining 0.81 percent from all other provinces. Ontario holds the most maple syrup farms in Canada outside of Quebec, with 2,240 maple syrup producers in 2011. This is followed by New Brunswick, with 191 maple syrup producers; and Nova Scotia, with 152 maple syrup producers.

As of 2016, Quebec had some 7,300 producers working with 13,500 farmers, collectively making over of syrup. Production in Quebec is controlled through a <a href="supply%20management%20%28Canada%29">supply management</a> system, with producers receiving quota allotments from the <a href="Federation%20of%20Quebec%20Maple%20Syrup%20Producers">Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers</a> ("Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec", FPAQ), which also maintains reserves of syrup, although there is a black-market trade in Quebec product. In 2017, the FPAQ mandated increased output of maple syrup production, attempting to establish Quebec's dominance in the world market. 

The Canadian provinces of <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> and <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> produce maple syrup using the sap of the <a href="Acer%20negundo">box elder or Manitoba maple ("Acer negundo")</a>. In 2011, there were 67 maple syrup producers in Manitoba, and 24 in Saskatchewan. A Manitoba maple tree's yield is usually less than half that of a similar sugar maple tree. Manitoba maple syrup has a slightly different flavour from sugar-maple syrup, because it contains less sugar and the tree's sap flows more slowly. <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> is home to a growing maple sugar industry using sap from the <a href="bigleaf%20maple">bigleaf maple</a>, which is native to the West Coast of the United States and Canada. In 2011, there were 82 maple syrup producers in British Columbia.

<a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> is the biggest US producer, with over during the 2013 season, followed by <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> with and <a href="Maine">Maine</a> with . <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> all produced marketable quantities of maple syrup of less than each in 2013. As of 2003, Vermont produced about 5.5 percent of the global syrup supply.

Maple syrup has been produced on a small scale in some other countries, notably Japan and South Korea. However, in South Korea in particular, it is traditional to consume maple sap, called "gorosoe", instead of processing it into syrup.

Under Canadian <a href="Maple">Maple Product</a> Regulations, containers of maple syrup must include the words "maple syrup", its grade name and net quantity in <a href="litre">litre</a>s or <a href="millilitres">millilitres</a>, on the main display panel with a minimum font size of 1.6 mm. If the maple syrup is of Canada Grade A level, the name of the colour class must appear on the label in both English and French. Also, the <a href="lot%20number">lot number</a> or <a href="production%20code">production code</a>, and either: (1) the name and address of the <a href="sugar%20bush">sugar bush</a> establishment, packing or shipper establishment, or (2) the first dealer and the registration number of the packing establishment, must be labeled on any display panel other than the bottom.

Following an effort from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup producer associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding the classification of maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been a work in progress for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The <a href="Canadian%20Food%20Inspection%20Agency">Canadian Food Inspection Agency</a> (CFIA) announced in the "<a href="Canada%20Gazette">Canada Gazette</a>" on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, at the request of the IMSI.

As of December 31, 2014, the CFIA and as of March 2, 2015, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) <a href="Agricultural%20Marketing%20Service">Agricultural Marketing Service</a> issued revised standards intended to harmonize Canada-United States regulations on the classification of maple syrup as follows:


As long as maple syrup does not have an off-flavour, is of a uniform colour, and is free from <a href="turbidity">turbidity</a> and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements, and then must be labelled as Processing Grade maple syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons. If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as Substandard.

This grading system was accepted and made law by most maple-producing states and provinces, and became compulsory in Canada as of 13 December 2016. Vermont, in an effort to "jump-start" the new grading regulations, adopted the new grading system as of January 1, 2014, after the grade changes passed the Senate and House in 2013. Maine passed a bill to take effect as soon as both Canada and the United States adopted the new grades. In New York, the new grade changes became law on January 1, 2015. New Hampshire did not require legislative approval and so the new grade laws became effective as of December 16, 2014, and producer compliance was required as of January 1, 2016.

Golden and Amber grades typically have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark and have an intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested earlier in the season tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal <a href="transmittance">transmittance</a> at 560 nm <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> through a 10 mm sample. Golden must have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber must have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark must have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product having less than 25.0 percent transmittance.

In Canada, maple syrup was classified prior to December 31, 2014, by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as one of three grades, each with several colour classes:

Producers in Ontario or Quebec may have followed either federal or provincial grading guidelines. Quebec's and Ontario's guidelines differed slightly from the federal:


A typical year's yield for a maple syrup producer will be about 25 to 30 percent of each of the #1 colours, 10 percent #2 Amber, and 2 percent #3 Dark.

The United States used (some states still do, as they await state regulation) different grading standards. Maple syrup was divided into two major grades: 

In Massachusetts, the Grade B was renamed as "Grade A Very Dark, Strong Taste."

The <a href="Vermont%20Agency%20of%20Agriculture%20Food%20and%20Markets">Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets</a> used a similar grading system of colour, and is roughly equivalent, especially for lighter syrups, but using letters: "AA", "A", etc. The Vermont grading system differed from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density (measured on the <a href="Baum%C3%A9%20scale">Baumé scale</a>). New Hampshire maintained a similar standard, but not a separate state grading scale. The Vermont-graded product had 0.9 percent more sugar and less water in its composition than US-graded. One grade of syrup not for table use, called commercial or Grade C, was also produced under the Vermont system.

In Canada, the packing of maple syrup must follow the "Packing" conditions stated in the Maple Products Regulations, or utilize the equivalent Canadian or imported grading system.

As stated in the Maple Products Regulations, Canadian maple syrup can be classified as "Canadian <a href="Food%20grading">Grade A</a>" and "Canadian Processing Grade". Any maple syrup container under these classifications should be filled to at least 90% of the bottle size while still containing the net quantity of syrup product as stated on the label. Every container of maple syrup must be new if it has a capacity of 5 <a href="litre">litre</a>s or less or is marked with a grade name. Every container of <a href="maple%20sugar">maple sugar</a> must also be new if it has a capacity of less than 5 kg or is either <a href="export">export</a>ed out of Canada or conveyed from one province to another.

Each maple syrup product must be verified clean if it follows a grade name or if it is exported out of the province in which it was originally manufactured.

The basic ingredient in maple syrup is the sap from the <a href="xylem">xylem</a> of sugar maple or various other species of maple trees. It consists primarily of <a href="sucrose">sucrose</a> and water, with small amounts of the monosaccharides <a href="glucose">glucose</a> and <a href="fructose">fructose</a> from the <a href="invert%20sugar">invert sugar</a> created in the boiling process.

In a 100g amount, maple syrup provides 260 <a href="calories">calories</a> and is composed of 32 percent water by weight, 67 percent <a href="carbohydrates">carbohydrates</a> (90 percent of which are sugars), and no appreciable protein or fat (table). Maple syrup is generally low in overall <a href="micronutrient">micronutrient</a> content, although <a href="manganese">manganese</a> and <a href="riboflavin">riboflavin</a> are at high levels along with moderate amounts of <a href="zinc">zinc</a> and <a href="calcium">calcium</a> (right table). It also contains trace amounts of <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s which increase in content as sap flow occurs.

Maple syrup contains a wide variety of volatile organic compounds, including <a href="vanillin">vanillin</a>, <a href="hydroxybutanone">hydroxybutanone</a>, and <a href="propionaldehyde">propionaldehyde</a>. It is not yet known exactly what compounds are responsible for maple syrup's distinctive flavour, however its primary flavour contributing compounds are maple <a href="furanone">furanone</a>, <a href="Furaneol">strawberry furanone</a>, and <a href="maltol">maltol</a>.

New compounds have been identified in maple syrup, one of which is <a href="quebecol">quebecol</a>, a <a href="natural%20phenol">natural phenol</a>ic compound created when the maple sap is boiled to create syrup.

One author described maple syrup as "a unique ingredient, smooth- and silky-textured, with a sweet, distinctive flavour – hints of caramel with overtones of toffee will not do – and a rare colour, amber set alight. Maple flavour is, well, maple flavour, uniquely different from any other." <a href="Agriculture%20Canada">Agriculture Canada</a> has developed a "flavour wheel" that details 91 unique flavours that can be present in maple syrup. These flavours are divided into 13 families: vanilla, empyreumatic (burnt), milky, fruity, floral, spicy, foreign (deterioration or fermentation), foreign (environment), maple, confectionery, plant (herbaceous), plant (forest, humus or cereals), and plant (ligneous). These flavours are evaluated using a procedure similar to <a href="wine%20tasting">wine tasting</a>. Other culinary experts praise its unique flavour.

Maple syrup and its various artificial imitations are widely used as toppings for <a href="pancake">pancake</a>s, <a href="waffle">waffle</a>s, and <a href="French%20toast">French toast</a> in North America. They can also be used to flavour a variety of foods, including <a href="fritter">fritter</a>s, <a href="ice%20cream">ice cream</a>, <a href="porridge">hot cereal</a>, fresh <a href="fruit">fruit</a>, and sausages. It is also used as sweetener for <a href="granola">granola</a>, <a href="applesauce">applesauce</a>, <a href="baked%20beans">baked beans</a>, candied <a href="sweet%20potato">sweet potato</a>es, winter <a href="Squash%20%28fruit%29">squash</a>, cakes, pies, breads, tea, coffee, and <a href="hot%20toddy">hot toddies</a>. Maple syrup can also be used as a replacement for honey in wine (<a href="mead">mead</a>).

In Canada, maple syrup must be made entirely from maple sap, and syrup must have a density of 66° on the <a href="Brix">Brix</a> scale to be marketed as maple syrup. In the United States, maple syrup must be made almost entirely from maple sap, although small amounts of substances such as salt may be added. Labeling laws prohibit imitation syrups from having "maple" in their names unless the finished product contains 10 percent or more of natural maple syrup.

"Maple-flavoured" syrups include maple syrup, but may contain additional ingredients. "Pancake syrup", "waffle syrup", "table syrup", and similarly named syrups are substitutes which are less expensive than maple syrup. In these syrups, the primary ingredient is most often <a href="high-fructose%20corn%20syrup">high-fructose corn syrup</a> flavoured with <a href="sotolon">sotolon</a>; they have little genuine maple content, and are usually thickened above the <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a> of maple syrup.

Imitation syrups are generally cheaper than maple syrup, with less natural flavour. In the United States, consumers generally prefer imitation syrups, likely because of the significantly lower cost and sweeter flavour; they typically cost about $8 per <a href="gallon">gallon</a> (), whereas authentic maple syrup costs $40 to $60 per gallon (2015 prices).

In 2016, maple syrup producers from nine US states petitioned the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) to regulate labeling of products containing maple syrup or using the word "maple" in manufactured products, indicating that imitation maple products contained insignificant amounts of natural maple syrup. In September 2016, the FDA published a consumer advisory to carefully inspect the ingredient list of products labeled as "maple".

Maple products are considered emblematic of Canada, and are frequently sold in tourist shops and airports as souvenirs from Canada. The sugar maple's leaf has come to symbolize Canada, and is depicted on the <a href="Flag%20of%20Canada">country's flag</a>. Several US states, including West Virginia, New York, Vermont and Wisconsin, have the sugar maple as their <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20trees">state tree</a>. A scene of sap collection is depicted on the Vermont <a href="50%20State%20Quarters">state quarter</a>, issued in 2001.

Maple syrup and maple sugar were used during the American Civil War and by <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionists</a> in the years before the war because most cane sugar and <a href="molasses">molasses</a> were produced by <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern</a> <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a>. Because of food rationing during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and maple sugar, and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.

Microscopium

Microscopium ("the Microscope") is a minor <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="southern%20celestial%20hemisphere">southern celestial hemisphere</a>, one of twelve created in the 18th century by French <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> and one of several depicting scientific instruments. The name is a <a href="Latin">Latin</a>ised form of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> word for <a href="microscope">microscope</a>. Its <a href="star">star</a>s are faint and hardly visible from most of the non-tropical <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>.

The constellation's brightest star is <a href="Gamma%20Microscopii">Gamma Microscopii</a> of <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 4.68, a yellow giant 2.5 times the Sun's mass located 223 ± 8 light-years distant. It passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly disturbing the outer Solar System. Two star systems—<a href="WASP-7">WASP-7</a> and <a href="HD%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B205739">HD 205739</a>—have been determined to have <a href="exoplanet">planets</a>, while two others—the young <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> star <a href="AU%20Microscopii">AU Microscopii</a> and the sunlike <a href="HD%20202628">HD 202628</a>—have <a href="debris%20disk">debris disk</a>s. AU Microscopii and the binary red dwarf system <a href="AT%20Microscopii">AT Microscopii</a> are probably a wide triple system and members of the <a href="Beta%20Pictoris%20moving%20group">Beta Pictoris moving group</a>. Nicknamed "Speedy Mic", <a href="BO%20Microscopii">BO Microscopii</a> is a star with an extremely fast rotation period of 9 hours, 7 minutes.

Microscopium is a small constellation bordered by <a href="Capricornus">Capricornus</a> to the north, <a href="Piscis%20Austrinus">Piscis Austrinus</a> and <a href="Grus%20%28constellation%29">Grus</a> to the east, <a href="Sagittarius%20%28constellation%29">Sagittarius</a> to the west, and <a href="Indus%20%28constellation%29">Indus</a> to the south, touching on <a href="Telescopium">Telescopium</a> to the southwest. The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Mic'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of four segments ("illustrated in infobox"). In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −27.45° and −45.09°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude <a href="45th%20parallel%20north">45°N</a>. Given that its brightest stars are of fifth magnitude, the constellation is invisible to the naked eye in areas with <a href="Light%20pollution">polluted</a> skies.

French astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> charted and designated ten stars with the <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s <a href="Alpha%20Microscopii">Alpha</a> through to <a href="Iota%20Microscopii">Iota</a> in 1756. A star in neighbouring Indus that Lacaille had labelled Nu Indi turned out to be in Microscopium, so Gould renamed it <a href="Nu%20Microscopii">Nu Microscopii</a>. <a href="Francis%20Baily">Francis Baily</a> considered Gamma and Epsilon Microscopii to belong to the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus, but subsequent cartographers did not follow this. In his 1725 "Catalogus Britannicus", John Flamsteed labelled the stars 1, 2, 3 and 4 Piscis Austrini, which became Gamma Microscopii, <a href="2%20Piscis%20Austrini">HR 8076</a>, <a href="3%20Piscis%20Austrini">HR 8110</a> and Epsilon Microscopii respectively. Within the constellation's borders, there are 43 stars brighter than or equal to <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 6.5.

Depicting the eyepiece of the microscope is <a href="Gamma%20Microscopii">Gamma Microscopii</a>, which—at magnitude of 4.68—is the brightest star in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> star, it has swollen and cooled to become a yellow <a href="giant%20star">giant</a> of <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Spectral%20types">spectral type</a> G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 223 ± 8 light years from Earth. At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a>. <a href="Alpha%20Microscopii">Alpha Microscopii</a> is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 400 ± 30 light-years away from Earth, it has swollen to 17.5 times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5 cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. <a href="Epsilon%20Microscopii">Epsilon Microscopii</a> lies 166 ± 5 light-years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. <a href="Theta1%20Microscopii">Theta</a> and <a href="Theta2%20Microscopii">Theta Microscopii</a> make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class <a href="Alpha%C2%B2%20Canum%20Venaticorum%20variable">magnetic spectrum variable stars</a> with strong metallic lines, similar to <a href="Cor%20Caroli">Cor Caroli</a>. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.

Many notable objects are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. AX Microscopii, better known as <a href="Lacaille%208760">Lacaille 8760</a>, is a <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> which lies only 12.9 light-years from the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>. At magnitude 6.68, it is the brightest red dwarf in the sky. <a href="BO%20Microscopii">BO Microscopii</a> is a rapidly rotating star that has 80% the diameter of the Sun. Nicknamed "Speedy Mic", it has a rotation period of 9 hours 7 minutes. An active star, it has prominent <a href="solar%20flare">stellar flares</a> that average 100 times stronger than those of the Sun, and are emitting energy mainly in the X-ray and ultraviolet bands of the spectrum. It lies 218 ± 4 light-years away from the Sun. <a href="AT%20Microscopii">AT Microscopii</a> is a binary star system, both members of which are flare star red dwarfs. The system lies close to and may form a very wide triple system with <a href="AU%20Microscopii">AU Microscopii</a>, a young star which appears to be a <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a> in the making with a <a href="debris%20disk">debris disk</a>. The three stars are candidate members of the <a href="Beta%20Pictoris%20moving%20group">Beta Pictoris moving group</a>, one of the nearest <a href="Stellar%20kinematics">associations of stars</a> that share a common motion through space.

The <a href="Astronomical%20Society%20of%20Southern%20Africa">Astronomical Society of Southern Africa</a> in 2003 reported that observations of four of the <a href="Mira%20variable">Mira variable</a>s in Microscopium were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete. Two of them—<a href="R%20Microscopii">R</a> and <a href="S%20Microscopii">S Microscopii</a>—are challenging stars for novice amateur astronomers, and the other two, <a href="U%20Microscopii">U</a> and <a href="RY%20Microscopii">RY Microscopii</a>, are more difficult still. Another red giant, <a href="T%20Microscopii">T Microscopii</a>, is a <a href="Semiregular%20variable%20star">semiregular variable</a> that ranges between magnitudes 7.7 and 9.6 over 344 days. Of apparent magnitude 11, <a href="DD%20Microscopii">DD Microscopii</a> is a <a href="symbiotic%20star">symbiotic star</a> system composed of an orange giant of spectral type K2III and <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> in close orbit, with the smaller star ionizing the stellar wind of the larger star. The system has a low <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a>. Combined with its high galactic latitude, this indicates that the star system has its origin in the <a href="galactic%20halo">galactic halo</a> of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>.

<a href="HD%20205739">HD 205739</a> is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F7V that is around 1.22 times as massive and 2.3 times as luminous as the Sun. It has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of 280 days that was discovered by the <a href="methods%20of%20detecting%20extrasolar%20planets%23Radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> method. <a href="WASP-7">WASP-7</a> is a star of spectral type F5V with an apparent magnitude of 9.54, about 1.28 times as massive as the Sun. Its <a href="hot%20Jupiter">hot Jupiter</a> planet—<a href="WASP-7b">WASP-7b</a>—was discovered by <a href="Methods%20of%20detecting%20extrasolar%20planets%23Transit%20method">transit method</a> and found to orbit the star every 4.95 days. <a href="HD%20202628">HD 202628</a> is a sunlike star of spectral type G2V with a debris disk that ranges from 158 to 220 AU distant. Its inner edge is sharply defined, indicating a probable planet orbiting between 86 and 158 AU from the star.

Describing Microscopium as "totally unremarkable", astronomer <a href="Patrick%20Moore">Patrick Moore</a> concluded there was nothing of interest for amateur observers. <a href="NGC%206925">NGC 6925</a> is a <a href="barred%20spiral%20galaxy">barred spiral galaxy</a> of apparent magnitude 11.3 which is lens-shaped, as it lies almost edge-on to observers on Earth, 3.7 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Microscopii. <a href="SN%202011ei">SN 2011ei</a>, a <a href="Supernova%23Type%20II">Type II Supernova</a> in NGC 6925, was discovered by Stu Parker in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> in July 2011. <a href="NGC%206923">NGC 6923</a> lies nearby and is a magnitude fainter still. The <a href="Microscopium%20Void">Microscopium Void</a> is a roughly rectangular region of relatively empty space, bounded by incomplete sheets of galaxies from other voids. The <a href="Microscopium%20Supercluster">Microscopium Supercluster</a> is an overdensity of galaxy clusters that was first noticed in the early 1990s. The component Abell clusters <a href="Abell%203695">3695</a> and <a href="Abell%203696">3696</a> are likely to be gravitationally bound, while the relations of Abell clusters <a href="Abell%203693">3693</a> and <a href="Abell%203705">3705</a> in the same field are unclear.

The <a href="Microscopids">Microscopids</a> are a minor <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a> that appear from June to mid-July.

The stars that comprise Microscopium are in a region previously considered the hind feet of Sagittarius, a neighbouring constellation. <a href="John%20Ellard%20Gore">John Ellard Gore</a> wrote that <a href="al-Sufi">al-Sufi</a> seems to have reported that <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> had seen the stars but he (Al Sufi) did not pinpoint their positions. Microscopium itself was introduced in 1751–52 by Lacaille with the French name "le Microscope", after he had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>. He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. Commemorating the <a href="Optical%20microscope%23compound%20microscope">compound microscope</a>, the Microscope's name had been Latinised by Lacaille to "Microscopium" by 1763.

Manchester United Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28district%29">Old Trafford</a>, Greater Manchester, <a href="England">England</a>, that competes in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, the top flight of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football</a>. Nicknamed "the Red Devils", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to its current stadium, <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>, in 1910.

Manchester United have won more trophies than any other club in English football, with a record 20 <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions%23Total%20titles%20won">League titles</a>, 12 <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s, 5 <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cups</a> and a record 21 <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a>s. United have also won three <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>s, one <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Europa League</a>, one <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>, one <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a>, one <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a> and one <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>. In <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1998–99</a>, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental European <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a>. By winning the UEFA Europa League in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">2016–17</a>, they became <a href="UEFA%20club%20competition%20records%20and%20statistics%23List%20of%20teams%20to%20have%20won%20the%20three%20main%20European%20club%20competitions">one of five clubs</a> to have won all three main <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> club competitions.

The 1958 <a href="Munich%20air%20disaster">Munich air disaster</a> claimed the lives of eight players. In 1968, under the management of <a href="Matt%20Busby">Matt Busby</a>, Manchester United became the first English football club to win the European Cup. <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a> won 38 trophies as manager, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and 2013, when he announced his retirement.

Manchester United was the <a href="Deloitte%20Football%20Money%20League">highest-earning</a> football club in the world for 2016–17, with an annual revenue of €676.3 million, and the world's <a href="Forbes%27%20list%20of%20the%20most%20valuable%20football%20clubs">most valuable</a> football club in 2018, valued at £3.1 billion. As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2 billion. After being floated on the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> in 1991, the club was purchased by <a href="Malcolm%20Glazer">Malcolm Glazer</a> in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800 million, after which the company was taken private again, before going public once more in August 2012, when they made an <a href="initial%20public%20offering">initial public offering</a> on the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a>. Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world, and has rivalries with <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">Liverpool</a>, <a href="Manchester%20derby">Manchester City</a>, <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">Arsenal</a>, and <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">Leeds United</a>.

Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the <a href="Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</a> (LYR) depot at <a href="Newton%20Heath">Newton Heath</a>. The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>' reserve team. By 1888, the club had become a founding member of <a href="The%20Combination">The Combination</a>, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed <a href="Football%20Alliance">Football Alliance</a>, which ran for three seasons before being merged with the Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a>, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the "LYR" from its name. After two seasons, the club was relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>.
In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £ in 2019 – the club was served with a <a href="liquidation">winding-up order</a>. Captain <a href="Harry%20Stafford">Harry Stafford</a> found four local businessmen, including <a href="John%20Henry%20Davies">John Henry Davies</a> (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name; on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born. Under <a href="Ernest%20Mangnall">Ernest Mangnall</a>, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">Charity Shield</a> and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911, but at the end of the following season, Mangnall left the club to join <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>.

In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a <a href="yo-yo%20club">yo-yo club</a>, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for <a href="James%20W.%20Gibson">James W. Gibson</a>, who, in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club. In the <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1938–39 season</a>, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.

In October 1945, the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of <a href="Matt%20Busby">Matt Busby</a>, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions. Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in <a href="1948%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1948</a>. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years. They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed "the Busby Babes" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players. In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> the same opportunity the previous season. En route to the semi-final, which they lost to <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, the team recorded a 10–0 victory over Belgian champions <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a>, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.
The following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a>, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The <a href="Munich%20air%20disaster">Munich air disaster</a> of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players – <a href="Geoff%20Bent">Geoff Bent</a>, <a href="Roger%20Byrne">Roger Byrne</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Colman">Eddie Colman</a>, <a href="Duncan%20Edwards">Duncan Edwards</a>, <a href="Mark%20Jones%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201933%29">Mark Jones</a>, <a href="David%20Pegg">David Pegg</a>, <a href="Tommy%20Taylor">Tommy Taylor</a> and <a href="Billy%20Whelan">Billy Whelan</a> – and injured several more.
Assistant manager <a href="Jimmy%20Murphy%20%28footballer%29">Jimmy Murphy</a> took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the <a href="1958%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup final</a>, which they lost to <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a>. In recognition of the team's tragedy, <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> invited the club to compete in the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20European%20Cup">1958–59 European Cup</a> alongside eventual League champions <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a>. Despite approval from the FA, the Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified. Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as <a href="Denis%20Law">Denis Law</a> and <a href="Pat%20Crerand">Pat Crerand</a>, who combined with the next generation of youth players – including <a href="George%20Best">George Best</a> – to win the FA Cup in <a href="1963%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1963</a>. The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English (and second British) club to win the European Cup, beating <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> 4–1 in the <a href="1968%20European%20Cup%20Final">final</a> with a team that contained three <a href="Ballon%20d%27Or%20%281956%E2%80%932009%29">European Footballers of the Year</a>: <a href="Bobby%20Charlton">Bobby Charlton</a>, Denis Law and George Best. They then represented Europe in the <a href="1968%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1968 Intercontinental Cup</a> against Estudiantes of Argentina, but lost the tie after losing the first leg in Buenos Aires, before a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford three weeks later. Busby resigned as manager in 1969 before being replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player <a href="Wilf%20McGuinness">Wilf McGuinness</a>.

Following an eighth-place finish in the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1969–70 season</a> and a poor start to the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1970–71 season</a>, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, <a href="Frank%20O%27Farrell">Frank O'Farrell</a> was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by <a href="Tommy%20Docherty">Tommy Docherty</a> in December 1972. Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club. The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in <a href="1976%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1976</a>, but were beaten by <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>. They reached the final again in <a href="1977%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1977</a>, beating <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> 2–1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.

<a href="Dave%20Sexton">Dave Sexton</a> replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including <a href="Joe%20Jordan%20%28footballer%29">Joe Jordan</a>, <a href="Gordon%20McQueen">Gordon McQueen</a>, <a href="Gary%20Bailey">Gary Bailey</a>, and <a href="Ray%20Wilkins">Ray Wilkins</a>, the team failed to achieve any significant results; they finished in the top two in 1979–80 and lost to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in the <a href="1979%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1979 FA Cup Final</a>. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction. He was replaced by <a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a>, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign <a href="Bryan%20Robson">Bryan Robson</a> from <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years – in <a href="1983%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1983</a> and <a href="1985%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1985</a>. In <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1985–86</a>, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league, but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.

<a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a> and his assistant <a href="Archie%20Knox">Archie Knox</a> arrived from <a href="Aberdeen%20F.C.">Aberdeen</a> on the day of Atkinson's dismissal, and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1987–88</a>, the club was back in 11th place the following season. Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, victory over <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> in the <a href="1990%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1990 FA Cup Final</a> replay (after a 3–3 draw) saved Ferguson's career. The following season, Manchester United claimed its first <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cup</a> title and competed in the <a href="1991%20European%20Super%20Cup">1991 UEFA Super Cup</a>, beating <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20European%20Cup">European Cup</a> holders <a href="Red%20Star%20Belgrade">Red Star Belgrade</a> 1–0 in the final at Old Trafford. A second consecutive League Cup final appearance followed in 1992, in which the team beat Nottingham Forest 1–0 at Wembley. In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first "<a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">Double</a>" in the club's history. United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995–96, before retaining the league title once more in 1996–97 with a game to spare.
In the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1998–99 season</a>, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League – "The Treble" – in the same season. Losing 1–0 going into <a href="injury%20time">injury time</a> in the <a href="1999%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">1999 UEFA Champions League Final</a>, <a href="Teddy%20Sheringham">Teddy Sheringham</a> and <a href="Ole%20Gunnar%20Solskj%C3%A6r">Ole Gunnar Solskjær</a> scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time. The club also won the Intercontinental Cup after beating <a href="Sociedade%20Esportiva%20Palmeiras">Palmeiras</a> 1–0 in Tokyo. Ferguson was subsequently knighted for his services to football.

Manchester United won the league again in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20FA%20Premier%20League">1999–2000</a> and <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Premier%20League">2000–01</a> seasons. The team finished third in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20FA%20Premier%20League">2001–02</a>, before regaining the title in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Premier%20League">2002–03</a>. They won the <a href="2004%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2003–04 FA Cup</a>, beating <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> 3–0 in the final at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> to lift the trophy for a record 11th time. In the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">2005–06 season</a>, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade, but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> in the <a href="2006%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2006 Football League Cup Final</a>. The club regained the Premier League in the 2006–07 season, before completing the <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29%23European%20Doubles">European double</a> in 2007–08 with a 6–5 penalty shoot-out victory over Chelsea in the <a href="2008%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2008 UEFA Champions League Final</a> in Moscow to go with their 17th English league title. <a href="Ryan%20Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> made a record 759th appearance for the club in that game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton. In December 2008, the club won the <a href="2008%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">2008 FIFA Club World Cup</a> and followed this with the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League%20Cup">2008–09 Football League Cup</a>, and its third successive Premier League title. That summer, <a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> was sold to Real Madrid for a world record £80 million. In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2–1 at Wembley to retain the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.

After finishing as runner-up to Chelsea in the 2009–10 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010–11, securing the championship with a 1–1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011. This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012–13, securing the championship with a 3–0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.

On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. The club announced the next day that <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> manager <a href="David%20Moyes">David Moyes</a> would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract. <a href="Ryan%20Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> for the first time since 1995–96. They also failed to qualify for the Europa League, meaning that it was the first time Manchester United hadn't qualified for a European competition since 1990. On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that <a href="Louis%20van%20Gaal">Louis van Gaal</a> would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant. <a href="Malcolm%20Glazer">Malcolm Glazer</a>, the patriarch of the Glazer family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.

Although Van Gaal's first season saw United once again qualify for the Champions League through a fourth-place finish in the Premier League, his second season saw United go out of the same tournament in the group stage. United also fell behind in the title race for the third consecutive season, finishing in 5th place, in spite of several expensive signings during Van Gaal's tenure. However, that same season, Manchester United won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for a 12th time, this being their first trophy won since 2013. Despite this victory, Van Gaal was sacked as manager just two days later, with <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mourinho">José Mourinho</a> appointed in his place on 27 May, signing a three-year contract. That season, United finished in sixth place while winning the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20EFL%20Cup">EFL Cup</a> for the fifth time and the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">Europa League</a> for the first time, as well as the <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a> for a record 21st time in Mourinho's first competitive match in charge. Despite not finishing in the top four, United qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> through their Europa League win. <a href="Wayne%20Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> scored his 250th goal with United, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as United's all-time top scorer, before leaving the club at the end of the season to return to Everton. Mourinho was sacked on 18 December 2018 with United in sixth place, 19 points behind league leaders Liverpool and 11 points outside the Champions League places. Former United player and manager of the Norwegian side <a href="Molde%20FK">Molde</a> <a href="Ole%20Gunnar%20Solskj%C3%A6r">Ole Gunnar Solskjær</a> was appointed caretaker manager the next day.

The club crest is derived from the <a href="Manchester%20City%20Council%23Coat%20of%20arms">Manchester City Council coat of arms</a>, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail. The devil stems from the club's nickname "The Red Devils"; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971.

Newton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'. A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue <a href="knickerbockers%20%28clothing%29">knickerbockers</a>. Between 1894–96, the players wore distinctive green and gold jerseys which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.

After the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit. Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red "V" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the <a href="1909%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1909 FA Cup Final</a>. They remained part of their home kits until 1927. For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change. The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and/or white socks were sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. For 2018–19, black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit. Since 1997–98, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility. The current home kit is a red shirt with black stripes gradually getting thicker towards the base and the trademark Adidas <a href="three%20stripes">three stripes</a> in black on the shoulders, black shorts, and red socks with black tops and gradual stripes in between.

The Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999–2000 season, and the 2011–12 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks. An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995–96 season was dropped after just five games, most notoriously against Southampton where Alex Ferguson forced the team to change into the third kit during half-time of its final outing. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit. In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as "Manchester United", a reversible white/gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.

The club's third kit is often all-blue, this was most recently the case during the 2014–15 season. Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons and once in 1996–97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998–99 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003–04 and 2005–06. From 2006–07 to 2013–14, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006–07 and 2010–11, apart from 2008–09 when an all-blue kit was launch to mark the 40th anniversary of the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20European%20Cup">1967–68 European Cup</a> success.


Newton Heath initially played on a field on <a href="North%20Road%20%28football%20ground%29">North Road</a>, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League. Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators. Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> on 4 March 1893. A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.

In June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary <a href="A.%20H.%20Albut">A. H. Albut</a> procured the use of the <a href="Bank%20Street%20%28football%20ground%29">Bank Street ground</a> in <a href="Clayton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Clayton</a>. It initially had no stands, by the start of the <a href="1893%E2%80%9394%20Newton%20Heath%20F.C.%20season">1893–94 season</a>, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the "Bradford end". At the opposite end, the "Clayton end", the ground had been "built up, thousands thus being provided for". Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw <a href="Alf%20Farman">Alf Farman</a> score a <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a>, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3–2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> three weeks later. In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the <a href="Broughton%20Rangers">Broughton Rangers</a> <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> club, and put up another stand on the "reserved side" (as distinct from the "popular side"). However, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.

When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at <a href="Harpurhey">Harpurhey</a> for the next reserves game against Padiham. Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street. Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.

Following Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition; in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000. Architect <a href="Archibald%20Leitch">Archibald Leitch</a> was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000. The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> semi-final between <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and <a href="Grimsby%20Town%20F.C.">Grimsby Town</a> drew 76,962 spectators.

Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the <a href="War%20Damage%20Commission">War Damage Commission</a> in the amount of £22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its "home" games at Manchester City's <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a> ground; Manchester United was charged £5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts. Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a>ed structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20season">1993–94 season</a>. First used on 25 March 1957 and costing £40,000, four pylons were erected, each housing 54 individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.

The <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>'s requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998–99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record. The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> 4–1, with just 114 seats (0.15 per cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied. In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957. Manchester United has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind <a href="Borussia%20Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>.

Manchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendance in Europe. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries. The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants <a href="Deloitte">Deloitte</a> estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide, while other estimates put this figure closer to 333 million. The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>), with over 71 million Facebook fans as of September 2016. A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.

Supporters are represented by two independent bodies; the <a href="Independent%20Manchester%20United%20Supporters%27%20Association">Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association</a> (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum, and the <a href="Manchester%20United%20Supporters%27%20Trust">Manchester United Supporters' Trust</a> (MUST). After the Glazer family's takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, <a href="F.C.%20United%20of%20Manchester">F.C. United of Manchester</a>. The West Stand of Old Trafford – the "<a href="Stretford%20End">Stretford End</a>" – is the home end and the traditional source of the club's most vocal support.

Manchester United has rivalries with <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>, <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>, <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>, and <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>, against whom they contest the <a href="Manchester%20derby">Manchester derby</a>.

The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> was a major port. The two clubs are the most successful English teams in both domestic and European competitions; and between them they have won <a href="List%20of%20English%20football%20champions">38 league titles</a>, 8 <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cups</a>, 4 <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cups</a>, 4 <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a>s, 19 <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s, 13 <a href="EFL%20Cup">League Cups</a>, 1 <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>, 1 <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a> and 36 <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">FA Community Shield</a>s. It is considered to be one of the biggest rivalries in the association football world and is considered the most famous fixture in English football.

The "Roses Rivalry" with Leeds stems from the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>, fought between the <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">House of Lancaster</a> and the <a href="House%20of%20York">House of York</a>, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.

The rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams, as well as managers <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a> and <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a>, have battled for the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> title. With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match-ups in history.

Manchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by <a href="Brand%20Finance">Brand Finance</a>, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £412 million – an increase of £39 million on the previous year, valuing it at £11 million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid – and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong). In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23 billion. The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona). In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3 billion. Forbes Magazine valued the club at $3.3 billion – $1.2 billion higher than the next most valuable sports team. They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689 billion.

The core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim. The "iconic" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded "<a href="catenaccio">catenaccio</a>" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) "captured the imagination of the English footballing public". Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the "<a href="Fifth%20Beatle">Fifth Beatle</a>" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.

As the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses. The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure. During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.

Because higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the <a href="BSkyB">BSkyB</a> broadcasting deal. Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51 million, compared to £42.5 million at Chelsea, £39.3 million at Liverpool, £34 million at Arsenal and £27.9 million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303 million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, <a href="MUTV%20%28Manchester%20United%20F.C.%29">MUTV</a> – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.

In an initial five-year deal worth £500,000, <a href="Sharp%20Corporation">Sharp Electronics</a> became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982–83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season, when <a href="Vodafone">Vodafone</a> agreed a four-year, £30 million deal. Vodafone agreed to pay £36 million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.

To commence at the start of the 2006–07 season, American insurance corporation <a href="American%20International%20Group">AIG</a> agreed a four-year £56.5 million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world. At the beginning of the 2010–11 season, American reinsurance company <a href="Aon%20plc">Aon</a> became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately £80 million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history. Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with <a href="DHL%20Express">DHL</a> reported to be worth £40 million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football. The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club's official logistics partner. The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth £180 million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the <a href="Trafford%20Training%20Centre">Trafford Training Centre</a>.

The club's first kit manufacturer was <a href="Umbro">Umbro</a>, until a five-year deal was agreed with <a href="Admiral%20Sportswear">Admiral Sportswear</a> in 1975. <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> received the contract in 1980, before Umbro started a second spell in 1992. Umbro's sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>'s record-breaking £302.9 million deal that lasted until 2015; 3.8 million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company. In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level "platinum" sponsors, including Aon and <a href="Budweiser">Budweiser</a>.

On 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a>, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014–15 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a>. Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014–15 season, citing rising costs. Since the start of the 2015–16 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of £750 million. Plumbing products manufacturer <a href="Kohler%20Co.">Kohler</a> became the club's first sleeve sponsor ahead of the 2018–19 season.

Originally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for £1 via an application form. In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies. After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000. Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948, but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian, but the position of chairman passed to former player <a href="Harold%20Hardman">Harold Hardman</a>.

Promoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately £40,000, he accumulated a 54 per cent shareholding and took control in January 1964. When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; <a href="Martin%20Edwards">Martin Edwards</a> went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980. Media tycoon <a href="Robert%20Maxwell">Robert Maxwell</a> attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price. In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to <a href="Michael%20Knighton">Michael Knighton</a> for £20 million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.

Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising £6.7 million), and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from <a href="Rupert%20Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>'s <a href="BSkyB">British Sky Broadcasting</a> Corporation. This resulted in the formation of "Shareholders United Against Murdoch" – now the "Manchester United Supporters' Trust" – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any <a href="hostile%20takeover">hostile takeover</a>. The Manchester United board accepted a £623 million offer, but the takeover was blocked by the <a href="Competition%20Commission%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Monopolies and Mergers Commission</a> at the final hurdle in April 1999. A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, <a href="John%20Magnier">John Magnier</a> and <a href="J.%20P.%20McManus">J. P. McManus</a>, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse <a href="Rock%20of%20Gibraltar%20%28horse%29">Rock of Gibraltar</a>, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.

In May 2005, <a href="Malcolm%20Glazer">Malcolm Glazer</a> purchased the 28.7 per cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £800 million (then approx. $1.5 billion). Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange. In July 2006, the club announced a £660 million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30 per cent reduction in annual interest payments to £62 million a year. In January 2010, with debts of £716.5 million ($1.17 billion), Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth £504 million, enabling them to pay off most of the £509 million owed to international banks. The annual interest payable on the bonds – which were to mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £45 million per annum. Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's <a href="Trafford%20Training%20Centre">Trafford Training Centre</a>. Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the "Red Knights", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest.

In August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached <a href="Credit%20Suisse">Credit Suisse</a> in preparation for a $1 billion (approx. £600 million) <a href="initial%20public%20offering">initial public offering</a> (IPO) on the <a href="Singapore%20Exchange">Singapore stock exchange</a> that would value the club at more than £2 billion. However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a> instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>'s disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3 billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.


Manchester United are one of the most successful clubs in Europe in terms of trophies won. The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which it won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886. In 1908, the club won its first league title, and won the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time the following year. Manchester United won the most trophies in the 1990s; five league titles, four FA Cups, one <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>, five <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">Charity Shields</a> (one shared), one <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, one <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>, one <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> and one <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a>.

The club holds the record for most top-division titles (20) – including a record 13 Premier League titles – and FA Community Shields (21). It was also the first English club to win the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> in <a href="1968%20European%20Cup%20Final">1968</a>, and, , is the only British club to have won the Club World Cup, in <a href="2008%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">2008</a>. United also became the sole British club to win the Intercontinental Cup, in <a href="1999%20Intercontinental%20Cup">1999</a>. The club's most recent trophy came in May 2017, with the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2016–17 UEFA Europa League</a>.

In winning the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, United became the fifth club in history to have won the "<a href="UEFA%20club%20competition%20records%20and%20statistics%23List%20of%20teams%20to%20have%20won%20the%20three%20main%20European%20club%20competitions">European Treble</a>" of <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup/UEFA Champions League</a>, <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">European Cup Winners' Cup/UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>, and <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League</a> after <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a>, <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> and <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>.






Especially short competitions such as the <a href="FA%20Community%20Shield">Charity/Community Shield</a>, <a href="Intercontinental%20Cup%20%28football%29">Intercontinental Cup</a> (now defunct), <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a> or <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.

Manchester United formed a <a href="Manchester%20United%20W.F.C.">women's football team</a> in 2018.

Morihei Ueshiba

The son of a landowner from <a href="Tanabe">Tanabe</a>, Ueshiba studied a number of martial arts in his youth, and served in the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Japanese Army</a> during the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a>. After being discharged in 1907, he moved to <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a> as the head of a pioneer settlement; here he met and studied with <a href="Takeda%20S%C5%8Dkaku">Takeda Sōkaku</a>, the founder of <a href="Dait%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB%20Aiki-j%C5%ABjutsu">Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu</a>. On leaving Hokkaido in 1919, Ueshiba joined the <a href="%C5%8Cmoto-ky%C5%8D">Ōmoto-kyō</a> movement, a <a href="Shinto">Shinto</a> sect, in <a href="Ayabe">Ayabe</a>, where he served as a martial arts instructor and opened his first <a href="dojo">dojo</a>. He accompanied the head of the Ōmoto-kyō group, <a href="Onisaburo%20Deguchi">Onisaburo Deguchi</a>, on an expedition to Mongolia in 1924, where they were captured by Chinese troops and returned to Japan. The following year, he had a profound spiritual experience, stating that, "a golden spirit sprang up from the ground, veiled my body, and changed my body into a golden one." After this experience, his martial arts skill appeared to be greatly increased.

Ueshiba moved to <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> in 1926, where he set up the <a href="Aikikai%20Hombu%20Dojo">Aikikai Hombu Dojo</a>. By now he was comparatively famous in martial arts circles, and taught at this dojo and others around Japan, including in several military academies. In the aftermath of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> the Hombu dojo was temporarily closed, but Ueshiba had by this point left Tokyo and retired to <a href="Iwama%2C%20Ibaraki">Iwama</a>, and he continued training at the dojo he had set up there. From the end of the war until the 1960s, he worked to promote aikido throughout Japan and abroad. He died from liver cancer in 1969.

After Ueshiba's death, aikido continued to be promulgated by his students (many of whom became noted martial artists in their own right). It is now practiced around the world.

Morihei Ueshiba was born in Nishinotani village (now part of the city of <a href="Tanabe%2C%20Wakayama">Tanabe</a>), <a href="Wakayama%20Prefecture">Wakayama Prefecture</a>, Japan, on December 14, 1883, the fourth child (and only son) born to Yoroku Ueshiba and his wife Yuki.

The young Ueshiba was raised in a somewhat privileged setting. His father Yoroku was a wealthy <a href="gentleman%20farmer">gentleman farmer</a> and minor politician, being an elected member of the Nishinotani village council for 22 consecutive years. His mother Yuki was from the Itokawa clan, a prominent local family who could trace their lineage back to the <a href="Heian%20period">Heian period</a>. Ueshiba was a rather weak, sickly child and bookish in his inclinations. At a young age his father encouraged him to take up <a href="sumo">sumo</a> wrestling and swimming and entertained him with stories of his great-grandfather Kichiemon, who was considered a very strong <a href="samurai">samurai</a> in his era. The need for such strength was further emphasized when the young Ueshiba witnessed his father being attacked by followers of a competing politician.

A major influence on Ueshiba's early education was his elementary schoolteacher Tasaburo Nasu, who was a <a href="Shinto">Shinto</a> priest and who introduced Ueshiba to the religion. At the age of six Ueshiba was sent to study at the Jizōderu Temple, but had little interest in the rote learning of <a href="Confucian">Confucian</a> education. However, his schoolmaster Mitsujo Fujimoto was also a priest of <a href="Shingon%20Buddhism">Shingon Buddhism</a>, and taught the young Ueshiba some of the esoteric chants and ritual observances of the sect, which Ueshiba found intriguing. His interest in Buddhism was sufficiently great that his mother considered enrolling him in the priesthood, but his father Yoroku vetoed the idea. Ueshiba went to Tanage Higher Elementary School and then to Tanabe Prefectural Middle School, but left formal education in his early teens, enrolling instead at a private <a href="abacus">abacus</a> academy, the Yoshida Institute, to study accountancy. On graduating from the academy, he worked at a local tax office for a few months, but the job did not suit him and in 1901 he left for Tokyo, funded by his father. Ueshiba Trading, the stationery business which he opened there, was short-lived; unhappy with life in the capital, he returned to Tanabe less than a year later after suffering a bout of <a href="beri-beri">beri-beri</a>. Shortly thereafter he married his childhood acquaintance Hatsu Itokawa.

In 1903, Ueshiba was called up for military service. He failed the initial physical examination, being shorter than the regulation . To overcome this, he stretched his spine by attaching heavy weights to his legs and suspending himself from tree branches; when he re-took the physical exam he had increased his height by the necessary half-inch to pass. He was assigned to the Osaka Fourth Division, 37th Regiment, and was promoted to corporal of the 61st Wakayama regiment by the following year; after serving on the front lines during the Russo-Japanese War he was promoted to sergeant. He was discharged in 1907, and again returned to his father's farm in Tanabe. Here he befriended the writer and philosopher <a href="Minakata%20Kumagusu">Minakata Kumagusu</a>, becoming involved with Minakata's opposition to the <a href="Government%20of%20Meiji%20Japan">Meiji government</a>'s <a href="Shrine%20Consolidation%20Policy">Shrine Consolidation Policy</a>. He and his wife had their first child, a daughter named Matsuko, in 1911.

Ueshiba studied several martial arts during his early life, and was renowned for his physical strength during his youth. During his sojourn in Tokyo he studied <a href="Kit%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB">Kitō-ryū</a> <a href="jujutsu">jujutsu</a> under Takisaburo Tobari, and briefly enrolled in a school teaching <a href="Shinkage-ry%C5%AB">Shinkage-ryū</a>. His training in <a href="Yagy%C5%AB%20Shingan-ry%C5%AB">Gotō-ha Yagyū-ryu</a> under Masakatsu Nakai was sporadic due to his military service, although he was granted a diploma in the art within a few years. In 1901 he received some instruction from Tozawa Tokusaburōin in <a href="Tenjin%20Shin%27y%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB">Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū</a> jujutsu and he studied <a href="judo">judo</a> with Kiyoichi Takagi in Tanabe in 1911, after his father had a dojo built on the family compound to encourage his son's training. In 1907, after his return from the war, he was also presented with a certificate of enlightenment ("shingon inkyo") by his childhood teacher Mitsujo Fujimoto.

In the early part of the 20th century, the prefectural government of <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a>, Japan's northernmost island, were offering various grants and incentives for mainland Japanese groups willing to relocate there. At the time, Hokkaidō was still largely unsettled by the Japanese, being occupied primarily by the indigenous <a href="Ainu%20people">Ainu</a>. In 1910, Ueshiba travelled to Hokkaidō in the company of his acquaintance Denzaburo Kurahashi, who had lived on the northern island before. His intent was to scout out a propitious location for a new settlement, and he found the site at <a href="Shirataki%2C%20Hokkaido">Shirataki</a> suitable for his plans. Despite the hardships he suffered on this journey (which included getting lost in snowstorms several times and an incident in which he nearly drowned in a freezing river), Ueshiba returned to Tanabe filled with enthusiasm for the project, and began recruiting families to join him. He became the leader of the Kishū Settlement Group, a collective of eighty-five pioneers who intended to settle in the Shirataki district and live as farmers; the group founded the village of Yubetsu (later Shirataki village) in August, 1912. Much of the funding for this project came from Ueshiba's father and his brothers-in-law Zenzo and Koshiro Inoue. Zenzo's son <a href="Noriaki%20Inoue">Noriaki</a> was also a member of the settlement group.

Poor soil conditions and bad weather led to crop failures during the first three years of the project, but the group still managed to cultivate <a href="Mentha">mint</a> and farm livestock. The burgeoning timber industry provided a boost to the settlement's economy, and by 1918 there were over 500 families residing there. A fire in 1917 razed the entire village, leading to the departure of around twenty families. Ueshiba was attending a meeting over railway construction around 50 miles away, but on learning of the fire travelled back the entire distance on foot. He was elected to the village council that year, and took a prominent role in leading the reconstruction efforts. In the summer of 1918, Hatsu gave birth to their first son, Takemori.

The young Ueshiba met <a href="Takeda%20S%C5%8Dkaku">Takeda Sōkaku</a>, the founder of <a href="Dait%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB%20Aiki-j%C5%ABjutsu">Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu</a>, at the Hisada Inn in <a href="Engaru%2C%20Hokkaido">Engaru</a>, in March 1915. Ueshiba was deeply impressed with Takeda's martial art, and despite being on an important mission for his village at the time, abandoned his journey to spend the next month studying with Takeda. He requested formal instruction and began studying Takeda's style of <a href="j%C5%ABjutsu">jūjutsu</a> in earnest, going so far as to construct a dojo at his home and inviting his new teacher to be a permanent house guest. He received a "<a href="ky%C5%8Dju%20dairi">kyōju dairi</a>" certificate, a teaching license, for the system from Takeda in 1922, when Takeda visited him in <a href="Ayabe">Ayabe</a>. Takeda also gave him a <a href="Yagy%C5%AB%20Shinkage-ry%C5%AB">Yagyū Shinkage-ryū</a> sword transmission scroll. Ueshiba then became a representative of Daitō-ryū, toured with Takeda as a teaching assistant and taught the system to others. The relationship between Ueshiba and Takeda was a complicated one. Ueshiba was an extremely dedicated student, dutifully attending to his teacher's needs and displaying great respect. However, Takeda overshadowed him throughout his early martial arts career, and Ueshiba's own students recorded the need to address what they referred to as "the Takeda problem".

In November 1919, Ueshiba learned that his father Yoroku was ill, and was not expected to survive. Leaving most of his possessions to Takeda, Ueshiba left Shirataki with the apparent intention of returning to Tanabe to visit his ailing parent. En route he made a detour to <a href="Ayabe%2C%20Kyoto">Ayabe</a>, near <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, intending to visit <a href="Onisaburo%20Deguchi">Onisaburo Deguchi</a>, the spiritual leader of the <a href="%C5%8Cmoto-ky%C5%8D">Ōmoto-kyō</a> religion (Ueshiba's nephew Noriaki Inoue had already joined the religion and may have recommended it to his uncle). Ueshiba stayed at the Ōmoto-kyō headquarters for several days, and met with Deguchi, who told him that, "There is nothing to worry about with your father". On his return to Tanabe, Ueshiba found that Yoroku had died. Criticised by family and friends for arriving too late to see his father, Ueshiba went into the mountains with a sword and practised solo sword exercises for several days; this almost led to his arrest when the police were informed of a sword-wielding madman on the loose.

Within a few months, Ueshiba was back in Ayabe, having decided to become a full-time student of Ōmoto-kyō. In 1920 he moved his entire family, including his mother, to the Ōmoto compound; at the same time he also purchased enough rice to feed himself and his family for several years. That same year, Deguchi asked Ueshiba to become the group's martial arts instructor, and a dojo—the first of several that Ueshiba was to lead—was constructed on the centre's grounds. Ueshiba also taught Takeda's Daitō-ryū in neighbouring <a href="Hy%C5%8Dgo%20Prefecture">Hyōgo Prefecture</a> during this period. His second son, Kuniharu, was born in 1920 in Ayabe, but died from illness the same year, along with three-year-old Takemori.

Takeda visited Ueshiba in Ayabe to provide instruction, although he was not a follower of Ōmoto and did not get along with Deguchi, which led to a cooling of the relationship between him and Ueshiba. Ueshiba continued to teach his martial art under the name "Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu", at the behest of his teacher. However, Deguchi encouraged Ueshiba to create his own style of martial arts, "Ueshiba-ryū", and sent many Ōmoto followers to study at the dojo. He also brought Ueshiba into the highest levels of the group's bureaucracy, making Ueshiba his executive assistant and putting him in charge of the Showa Seinenkai (Ōmoto-kyō's national youth organisation) and the Ōmoto Shobotai, a <a href="Volunteer%20fire%20department">volunteer fire service</a>.

His close relationship with Deguchi introduced Ueshiba to various members of Japan's far-right; members of the <a href="ultranationalist">ultranationalist</a> group the <a href="Sakurakai">Sakurakai</a> would hold meetings at Ueshiba's dojo, and he developed a friendship with the philosopher <a href="Sh%C5%ABmei%20%C5%8Ckawa">Shūmei Ōkawa</a> during this period, as well as meeting with <a href="Nissh%C5%8D%20Inoue">Nisshō Inoue</a> and <a href="Kozabur%C5%8D%20Tachibana">Kozaburō Tachibana</a>. Deguchi also offered Ueshiba's services as a bodyguard to <a href="Kingoro%20Hashimoto">Kingoro Hashimoto</a>, the Sakurakai's founder. Ueshiba's commitment to the goal of <a href="world%20peace">world peace</a>, stressed by many biographers, must be viewed in the light of these relationships and his Ōmoto-kyō beliefs. His association with the extreme right-wing is understandable when one considers that Ōmoto-kyō's view of world peace was of a <a href="benevolent%20dictatorship">benevolent dictatorship</a> by the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor of Japan</a>, with other nations being subjugated under Japanese rule.

In 1921, in an event known as the , the Japanese authorities raided the compound, destroying the main buildings on the site and arresting Deguchi on charges of <a href="l%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9">lèse-majesté</a>. Ueshiba's dojo was undamaged and over the following two years he worked closely with Deguchi to reconstruct the group's centre, becoming heavily involved in farming work and serving as the group's "Caretaker of Forms", a role which placed him in charge of overseeing Ōmoto's move towards self-sufficiency. His son <a href="Kisshomaru%20Ueshiba">Kisshomaru</a> was born in the summer of 1921.

Three years later, in 1924, Deguchi led a small group of Ōmoto-kyō disciples, including Ueshiba, on a journey to <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> at the invitation of retired naval captain Yutaro Yano and his associates within the ultra-nationalist <a href="Black%20Dragon%20Society">Black Dragon Society</a>. Deguchi's intent was to establish a new religious kingdom in Mongolia, and to this end he had distributed propaganda suggesting that he was the reincarnation of <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a>. Allied with the Mongolian bandit <a href="Lu%20Zhankui">Lu Zhankui</a>, Deguchi's group were arrested in <a href="Tongliao">Tongliao</a> by the Chinese authorities—fortunately for Ueshiba, whilst Lu and his men were executed by firing squad, the Japanese group were released into the custody of the Japanese consul. They were returned under guard to Japan, where Deguchi was imprisoned for breaking the terms of his bail. During this expedition Ueshiba was given the Chinese alias Wang Shou-gao, rendered in Japanese as "Moritaka" – he was reportedly very taken with this name and continued to use it intermittently for the rest of his life.

After returning to Ayabe, Ueshiba began a regimen of spiritual training, regularly retreating to the mountains or performing "<a href="misogi">misogi</a>" in the <a href="Nachi%20Falls">Nachi Falls</a>. As his prowess as a martial artist increased, his fame began to spread. He was challenged by many established martial artists, some of whom later became his students after being defeated by him. In the autumn of 1925 he was asked to give a demonstration of his art in Tokyo, at the behest of Admiral <a href="Isamu%20Takeshita">Isamu Takeshita</a>; one of the spectators was <a href="Yamamoto%20Gonnohy%C5%8De">Yamamoto Gonnohyōe</a>, who requested that Ueshiba stay in the capital to instruct the <a href="Imperial%20Guard%20%28Japan%29">Imperial Guard</a> in his martial art. After a couple of weeks, however, Ueshiba took issue with several government officials who voiced concerns about his connections to Deguchi; he cancelled the training and returned to Ayabe.

In 1926 Takeshita invited Ueshiba to visit Tokyo again. Ueshiba relented and returned to the capital, but while residing there was stricken with a serious illness. Deguchi visited his ailing student and, concerned for his health, commanded Ueshiba to return to Ayabe. The appeal of returning increased after Ueshiba was questioned by the police following his meeting with Deguchi; the authorities were keeping the Ōmoto-kyō leader under close surveillance. Angered at the treatment he had received, Ueshiba went back to Ayabe again. Six months later, this time with Deguchi's blessing, he and his family moved permanently to Tokyo. This move allowed Ueshiba to teach politicians, high-ranking military personnel, and members of the <a href="Imperial%20House%20of%20Japan">Imperial household</a>; suddenly he was no longer an obscure provincial martial artist, but a <a href="sensei">sensei</a> to some of Japan's most important citizens. Arriving in October 1927, the Ueshiba family set up home in the <a href="Shirokane">Shirokane</a> district. The building proved too small to house the growing number of aikido students, and so the Ueshibas moved to larger premises, first in <a href="Mita%2C%20Minato%2C%20Tokyo">Mita district</a>, then in <a href="Takanawa">Takanawa</a>, and finally to a purpose-built hall in <a href="Shinjuku%2C%20Tokyo">Shinjuku</a>. This last location, originally named the Kobukan (), would eventually become the <a href="Aikikai%23Hombu_D%C5%8Dj%C5%8D">Aikikai Hombu Dojo</a>. During its construction, Ueshiba rented a property nearby, where he was visited by <a href="Kan%C5%8D%20Jigor%C5%8D">Kanō Jigorō</a>, the founder of <a href="judo">judo</a>.

During this period, Ueshiba was invited to teach at a number of military institutes, due to his close personal relationships with key figures in the military (among them <a href="Sadao%20Araki">Sadao Araki</a>, the Japanese <a href="Ministry%20of%20War%20of%20Japan">Minister of War</a>). He accepted an invitation from Admiral <a href="Sankichi%20Takahashi">Sankichi Takahashi</a> to be the martial arts instructor at the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Naval%20Academy">Imperial Japanese Naval Academy</a>, and also taught at the <a href="Nakano%20School">Nakano Spy School</a>, although aikido was later judged to be too technical for the students there and <a href="karate">karate</a> was adopted instead. He also became a visiting instructor at the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%20Academy">Imperial Japanese Army Academy</a> after being challenged by (and defeating) General Makoto Miura, another student of Takeda Sōkaku's Daitō-ryū. Takeda himself met Ueshiba for the last time around 1935, while Ueshiba was teaching at the <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a> headquarters of the "<a href="Asahi%20Shimbun">Asahi Shimbun</a>" newspaper. Frustrated by the appearance of his teacher, who was openly critical of Ueshiba's martial arts and who appeared intent on taking over the classes there, Ueshiba left Osaka during the night, bowing to the residence in which Takeda was staying and thereafter avoiding all contact with him. Between 1940 and 1942 he made several visits to <a href="Manchukuo">Manchukuo</a> (Japanese occupied Manchuria) where he was the principal martial arts instructor at <a href="Kenkoku%20University">Kenkoku University</a>. Whilst in Manchuria, he met and defeated the sumo wrestler <a href="Tenry%C5%AB%20Sabur%C5%8D">Tenryū Saburō</a> during a demonstration.

The "Second Ōmoto Incident" in 1935 saw another government crackdown on Deguchi's sect, in which the Ayabe compound was destroyed and most of the group's leaders imprisoned. Although he had relocated to Tokyo, Ueshiba had retained links with the Ōmoto-kyō group (he had in fact helped Deguchi to establish a paramilitary branch of the sect only three years earlier) and expected to be arrested as one of its senior members. However, he had a good relationship with the local <a href="police%20commissioner">police commissioner</a> Kenji Tomita and the <a href="chief%20of%20police">chief of police</a> Gīchi Morita, both of whom had been his students. As a result, although he was taken in for interrogation, he was released without charge on Morita's authority.

In 1932, Ueshiba's daughter Matsuko was married to the swordsman <a href="Kiyoshi%20Nakakura">Kiyoshi Nakakura</a>, who was adopted as Ueshiba's heir under the name Morihiro Ueshiba. The marriage ended after a few years, and Nakakura left the family in 1937. Ueshiba later designated his son Kisshomaru as the heir to his martial art.

The 1930s saw Japan's invasion of mainland Asia and increased military activity in Europe. Ueshiba was concerned about the prospect of war, and became involved in a number of efforts to try and forestall the conflict that would eventually become <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He was part of a group, along with Shūmei Ōkawa and several wealthy Japanese backers, that tried to broker a deal with <a href="Harry%20Chandler">Harry Chandler</a> to export aviation fuel from the United States to Japan (in contravention of the ), although this effort ultimately failed. In 1941 Ueshiba also undertook a secret diplomatic mission to China at the behest of Prince <a href="Fumimaro%20Konoe">Fumimaro Konoe</a>. The intended goal was a meeting with <a href="Chiang%20Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> to establish peace talks, but Ueshiba was unable to meet with the Chinese leader, arriving too late to fulfil his mission.

From 1935 onwards, Ueshiba had been purchasing land in <a href="Iwama%2C%20Ibaraki">Iwama</a> in <a href="Ibaraki%20Prefecture">Ibaraki Prefecture</a>, and by the early 1940s had acquired around of farmland there. In 1942, disenchanted with the war-mongering and political manoeuvring in the capital, he left Tokyo and moved to Iwama permanently, settling in a small farmer's cottage. Here he founded the Aiki Shuren Dojo, also known as the <a href="Iwama%20dojo">Iwama dojo</a>, and the Aiki Shrine, a devotional shrine to the "Great Spirit of Aiki". During this time he travelled extensively in Japan, particularly in the <a href="Kansai%20region">Kansai region</a>, teaching his aikido. Despite the prohibition on the teaching of martial arts after World War II, Ueshiba and his students continued to practice in secret at the Iwama dojo; the Hombu dojo in Tokyo was in any case being used as a refugee centre for citizens displaced by the <a href="Bombing%20of%20Tokyo">severe firebombing</a>. It was during this period that Ueshiba met and befriended Koun Nakanishi, an expert in <a href="kotodama">kotodama</a>. The study of kotodama was to become one of Ueshiba's passions in later life, and Nakanishi's work inspired Ueshiba's concept of "<a href="Takemusu">takemusu aiki</a>".

The rural nature of his new home in Iwama allowed Ueshiba to concentrate on the second great passion of his life: farming. He had been born into a farming family and spent much of his life cultivating the land, from his settlement days in Hokkaidō to his work in Ayabe trying to make the Ōmoto-kyō compound self-sufficient. He viewed farming as a logical complement to martial arts; both were physically demanding and required single-minded dedication. Not only did his farming activities provide a useful cover for martial arts training under the government's restrictions, it also provided food for Ueshiba, his students and other local families at a time when food shortages were commonplace.

The government prohibition (on aikido, at least) was lifted in 1948 with the creation of the Aiki Foundation, established by the Japanese Ministry of Education with permission from the Occupation forces. The Hombu dojo re-opened the following year. After the war Ueshiba effectively retired from aikido. He delegated most of the work of running the Hombu dojo and the Aiki Federation to his son Kisshomaru, and instead chose to spend much of his time in prayer, meditation, calligraphy and farming. He still travelled extensively to promote aikido, even visiting <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> in 1961. He also appeared in a television documentary on aikido: NTV's "The Master of Aikido", broadcast in January 1960. Ueshiba maintained links with the <a href="Japanese%20nationalism">Japanese nationalist movement</a> even in later life; his student <a href="Kanshu%20Sunadomari">Kanshu Sunadomari</a> reported that Ueshiba temporarily sheltered <a href="Mikami%20Taku">Mikami Taku</a>, one of the naval officers involved in the <a href="May%2015%20Incident">May 15 Incident</a>, at Iwama.

In 1969, Ueshiba became ill. He led his last training session on March 10, and was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with cancer of the liver. He died suddenly on April 26, 1969. His body was buried at <a href="K%C5%8Dzan-ji">Kōzan-ji</a>, and he was given the <a href="Posthumous%20name">posthumous Buddhist title</a> "Aiki-in Moritake En'yū Daidōshi" (); parts of his hair were enshrined at Ayabe, Iwama and Kumano. Two months later, his wife Hatsu ( "Ueshiba Hatsu", née "Itokawa Hatsu"; 1881–1969) also died.

Aikido—usually translated as the "Way of Unifying Spirit" or the "Way of Spiritual Harmony"—is a fighting system that focuses on throws, pins and joint locks together with some striking techniques. It emphasises protecting the opponent and promotes spiritual and social development.

The technical curriculum of aikido was derived from the teachings of Takeda Sōkaku; the basic techniques of aikido stem from his Daitō-ryū system. In the earlier years of his teaching, from the 1920s to the mid-1930s, Ueshiba taught the Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu system; his early students' documents bear the term Daitō-ryū. Indeed, Ueshiba trained one of the future highest grade earners in Daitō-ryū, <a href="Takuma%20Hisa">Takuma Hisa</a>, in the art before Takeda took charge of Hisa's training.

The early form of training under Ueshiba was noticeably different from later forms of aikido. It had a larger curriculum, increased use of strikes to vital points ("<a href="atemi">atemi</a>") and a greater use of weapons. The schools of aikido developed by Ueshiba's students from the pre-war period tend to reflect the harder style of the early training. These students included <a href="Kenji%20Tomiki">Kenji Tomiki</a> (who founded the <a href="Shodokan%20Aikido">Shodokan Aikido</a> sometimes called Tomiki-ryū), <a href="Noriaki%20Inoue">Noriaki Inoue</a> (who founded Shin'ei Taidō), <a href="Minoru%20Mochizuki">Minoru Mochizuki</a> (who founded <a href="Yoseikan%20Budo">Yoseikan Budo</a>) and <a href="Gozo%20Shioda">Gozo Shioda</a> (who founded <a href="Yoshinkan%20Aikido">Yoshinkan Aikido</a>). Many of these styles are therefore considered "pre-war styles", although some of these teachers continued to train with Ueshiba in the years after World War II.
During his lifetime, Ueshiba had three spiritual experiences that impacted greatly on his understanding of the martial arts. The first occurred in 1925, after Ueshiba had defeated a naval officer's "<a href="bokken">bokken</a>" (wooden <a href="katana">katana</a>) attacks unarmed and without hurting the officer. Ueshiba then walked to his garden, where he had the following realisation:
His second experience occurred in 1940 when engaged in the ritual purification process of "misogi".
His third experience was in 1942 during the worst fighting of World War II, when Ueshiba had a vision of the "Great Spirit of Peace".
After these events, Ueshiba seemed to slowly grow away from Takeda, and he began to change his art. These changes are reflected in the differing names with which he referred to his system, first as "aiki-jūjutsu", then Ueshiba-ryū, Asahi-ryū, and "aiki budō". In 1942, when Ueshiba's group joined the <a href="Dai%20Nippon%20Butoku%20Kai">Dai Nippon Butoku Kai</a>, the martial art that Ueshiba developed finally came to be known as aikido.

As Ueshiba grew older, more skilled, and more spiritual in his outlook, his art also changed and became softer and more gentle. Martial techniques became less important, and more focus was given to the control of <a href="Qi">ki</a>. In his own expression of the art there was a greater emphasis on what is referred to as "kokyū-nage", or "breath throws" which are soft and blending, utilizing the opponent's movement in order to throw them. Ueshiba regularly practiced cold water "misogi", as well as other spiritual and religious rites, and viewed his studies of aikido as part of this spiritual training.
Over the years, Ueshiba trained <a href="List%20of%20aikidoka">a large number of students</a>, many of whom later became famous teachers in their own right and developed their own styles of aikido. Some of them were "<a href="uchi-deshi">uchi-deshi</a>", live-in students. Ueshiba placed many demands on his "uchi-deshi", expecting them to attend him at all times, act as training partners (even in the middle of the night), arrange his travel plans, massage and bathe him, and assist with household chores.

There were roughly four generations of students, comprising the pre-war students (training 1921–1935), students who trained during the Second World War (c.1936–1945), the post-war students in Iwama (c.1946–1955) and the students who trained with Ueshiba during his final years (c.1956–c.1969). As a result of Ueshiba's martial development throughout his life, students from each of these generations tend to have markedly different approaches to aikido. These variations are compounded by the fact that few students trained with Ueshiba for a protracted period; only Yoichiro Inoue, Kenji Tomiki, Gozo Shioda, Morihiro Saito, <a href="Tsutomu%20Yukawa">Tsutomu Yukawa</a> and <a href="Mitsugi%20Saotome">Mitsugi Saotome</a> studied directly under Ueshiba for more than five or six years. After the war, Ueshiba and the Hombu Dojo dispatched some of their students to various other countries, resulting in aikido spreading around the world.

Margaret Murray

Margaret Alice Murray (13 July 1863 – 13 November 1963) was an <a href="Anglo-Indian">Anglo-Indian</a> <a href="Egyptology">Egyptologist</a>, <a href="archaeology">archaeologist</a>, <a href="anthropology">anthropologist</a>, <a href="history">historian</a>, and <a href="folkloristics">folklorist</a>. The first woman to be appointed as a lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom, she worked at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> (UCL) from 1898 to 1935. She served as President of the <a href="Folklore%20Society">Folklore Society</a> from 1953 to 1955, and published widely over the course of her career.

Born to a wealthy middle-class English family in <a href="Kolkata">Calcutta</a>, <a href="British%20India">British India</a>, Murray divided her youth between India, Britain, and Germany, training as both a nurse and a social worker. Moving to London, in 1894 she began studying Egyptology at UCL, developing a friendship with department head <a href="Flinders%20Petrie">Flinders Petrie</a>, who encouraged her early academic publications and appointed her Junior Professor in 1898. In 1902–03 she took part in Petrie's <a href="Excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavations</a> at <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos, Egypt</a>, there discovering the <a href="Osireion">Osireion</a> temple and the following season investigated the <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a> cemetery, both of which established her reputation in Egyptology. Supplementing her UCL wage by giving public classes and lectures at the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> and <a href="Manchester%20Museum">Manchester Museum</a>, it was at the latter in 1908 that she led the unwrapping of Khnum-nakht, one of the <a href="mummy">mummies</a> recovered from the <a href="Tomb%20of%20two%20Brothers">Tomb of the Two Brothers</a> – the first time that a woman had publicly unwrapped a mummy. Recognising that British <a href="Egyptomania">Egyptomania</a> reflected the existence of a widespread public interest in <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, Murray wrote several books on Egyptology targeted at a general audience.

Murray also became closely involved in the <a href="first-wave%20feminism">first-wave feminist</a> movement, joining the <a href="Women%27s%20Social%20and%20Political%20Union">Women's Social and Political Union</a> and devoting much time to improving women's status at UCL. Unable to return to Egypt due to the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, she focused her research on the <a href="witch-cult%20hypothesis">witch-cult hypothesis</a>, the theory that the <a href="witch%20trials%20in%20the%20Early%20Modern%20period">witch trials of Early Modern Christendom</a> were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian, <a href="paganism">pagan</a> religion devoted to a <a href="Horned%20God">Horned God</a>. Although later academically discredited, the theory gained widespread attention and proved a significant influence on the emerging <a href="new%20religious%20movement">new religious movement</a> of <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>. From 1921 to 1931 Murray undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on <a href="Malta">Malta</a> and <a href="Menorca">Menorca</a> and developed her interest in folkloristics. Awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927, she was appointed Assistant Professor in 1928 and retired from UCL in 1935. That year she visited Palestine to aid Petrie's excavation of <a href="Tall%20al-Ajjul">Tall al-Ajjul</a> and in 1937 she led a small excavation at <a href="Petra">Petra</a> in Jordan. Taking on the presidency of the Folklore Society in later life, she lectured at such institutions as the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> and <a href="City%20Literary%20Institute">City Literary Institute</a>, and continued to publish in an independent capacity until her death.

Murray's work in Egyptology and archaeology was widely acclaimed and earned her the moniker of "The Grand Old Woman of Egyptology", although after her death many of her contributions to the field were overshadowed by those of Petrie. Conversely, Murray's work in folkloristics and the history of witchcraft has been academically discredited and her methods in these areas heavily criticised. The influence of her witch-cult theory in both religion and literature has been examined by various scholars, and she herself has been dubbed the "Grandmother of Wicca".

Margaret Murray was born on 13 July 1863 in <a href="Kolkata">Calcutta</a>, <a href="Bengal%20Presidency">Bengal Presidency</a>, then a major military city in <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a>. A member of the <a href="Anglo-Indian">wealthy British imperial elite</a>, she lived in the city with her family: parents James and Margaret Murray, an older sister named Mary, and her paternal grandmother and great-grandmother. James Murray, born in India of English descent, was a businessman and manager of the <a href="Serampore">Serampore</a> paper mills who was thrice elected President of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce. His wife, Margaret (née Carr), had moved to India from Britain in 1857 to work as a <a href="missionary">missionary</a>, preaching <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> and educating Indian women. She continued with this work after marrying James and giving birth to her two daughters.
Although most of their lives were spent in the European area of Calcutta, which was walled off from the indigenous sectors of the city, Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family's employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to <a href="Mussoorie">Mussoorie</a>. The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride in the fact that she had never had to sit an exam before entering university.

In 1870, Margaret and her sister Mary were sent to Britain, there moving in with their uncle John, a vicar, and his wife Harriet at their home in <a href="Lambourn">Lambourn</a>, <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>. Although John provided them with a strongly Christian education and a belief in <a href="Misogyny">the inferiority of women</a>, both of which she would reject, he awakened Murray's interest in archaeology through taking her to see local monuments. In 1873, the girls' mother arrived in Europe and took them with her to <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a> in Germany, where they both became fluent in <a href="German%20language">German</a>. In 1875 they returned to Calcutta, staying there till 1877. They then moved with their parents back to England, where they settled in <a href="Sydenham">Sydenham</a>, <a href="South%20London">South London</a>. There, they spent much time visiting <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">The Crystal Palace</a>, while their father worked at his firm's London office. In 1880, they returned to Calcutta, where Margaret remained for the next seven years. She became a nurse at the Calcutta General Hospital, which was run by the Sisters of the Anglican Sisterhood of Clower, and there was involved with the hospital's attempts to deal with a <a href="1881%E2%80%9396%20cholera%20pandemic">cholera outbreak</a>. In 1887, she returned to England, moving to <a href="Rugby%2C%20Warwickshire">Rugby</a>, <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, where her uncle John had moved, now widowed. Here she took up employment as a social worker dealing with local underprivileged people. When her father retired and moved to England, she moved into his house in <a href="Bushey">Bushey Heath</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, living with him until his death in 1891. In 1893 she then travelled to <a href="Chennai">Madras</a>, <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, where her sister had moved to with her new husband.

Encouraged by her mother and sister, Murray decided to enroll at the newly opened department of Egyptology at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> (UCL) in <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>, <a href="Central%20London">Central London</a>. Having been founded by an endowment from <a href="Amelia%20Blanford%20Edwards">Amelia Blanford Edwards</a>, one of the co-founders of the <a href="Egypt%20Exploration%20Society">Egypt Exploration Fund</a> (EEF), the department was run by the pioneering early archaeologist <a href="Flinders%20Petrie">Sir William Flinders Petrie</a>, and based in the Edwards Library of <a href="UCL%20Main%20Building">UCL's South Cloisters</a>. Murray began her studies at UCL at age 30 in January 1894, as part of a class composed largely of other women and older men. There, she took courses in the <a href="Egyptian%20language">Ancient Egyptian</a> and <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a> languages which were taught by <a href="Francis%20Llewellyn%20Griffith">Francis Llewellyn Griffith</a> and <a href="Walter%20Ewing%20Crum">Walter Ewing Crum</a> respectively.

Murray soon got to know Petrie, becoming his copyist and illustrator and producing the drawings for the published report on his excavations at <a href="Qift">Qift</a>, "Koptos". In turn, he aided and encouraged her to write her first research paper, "The Descent of Property in the Early Periods of Egyptian History", which was published in the "Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology" in 1895. Becoming Petrie's "de facto" though unofficial assistant, Murray began to give some of the linguistic lessons in Griffith's absence. In 1898 she was appointed to the position of Junior Lecturer, responsible for teaching the linguistic courses at the Egyptology department; this made her the first female lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom. In this capacity, she spent two days a week at UCL, devoting the other days to caring for her ailing mother. As time went on, she came to teach courses on Ancient Egyptian history, religion, and language. Among Murray's students – to whom she referred as "the Gang" – were several who went on to produce noted contributions to Egyptology, including <a href="Reginald%20Engelbach">Reginald Engelbach</a>, <a href="Georgina%20Aitken">Georgina Aitken</a>, <a href="Guy%20Brunton">Guy Brunton</a>, and <a href="Myrtle%20Broome">Myrtle Broome</a>. She supplemented her UCL salary by teaching evening classes in Egyptology at the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>.

At this point, Murray had no experience in field archaeology, and so during the 1902–03 field season, she travelled to Egypt to join Petrie's excavations at <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a>. Petrie and his wife, <a href="Hilda%20Petrie">Hilda Petrie</a>, had been excavating at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar <a href="%C3%89mile%20Am%C3%A9lineau">Émile Amélineau</a>. Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position. This led to some issues with some of the male excavators, who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman. This experience, coupled with discussions with other female excavators (some of whom were active in the feminist movement) led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints. While excavating at Abydos, Murray uncovered the <a href="Osireion">Osireion</a>, a temple devoted to the god <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a> during the period of the <a href="New%20Kingdom">New Kingdom</a>. She published her site report as "The Osireion at Abydos" in 1904; in the report, she examined the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building.

During the 1903–04 field season, Murray returned to Egypt, and at Petrie's instruction began her investigations at the <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a> cemetery near to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, which dated from the period of the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a>. Murray did not have legal permission to excavate the site, and instead spent her time transcribing the inscriptions from ten of the tombs that had been excavated during the 1860s by <a href="Auguste%20Mariette">Auguste Mariette</a>. She published her findings in 1905 as "Saqqara Mastabas I", although would not publish translations of the inscriptions until 1937 as "Saqqara Mastabas II". Both "The Osireion at Abydos" and "Saqqara Mastabas I" proved to be very influential in the Egyptological community, with Petrie recognising Murray's contribution to his own career.

On returning to London, Murray took an active role in the feminist movement, volunteering and financially donating to the cause and taking part in feminist demonstrations, protests, and marches. Joining the <a href="Women%27s%20Social%20and%20Political%20Union">Women's Social and Political Union</a>, she was present at large marches like the <a href="Mud%20March%20%28Suffragists%29">Mud March</a> of 1907 and the <a href="Women%27s%20Coronation%20Procession">Women's Coronation Procession</a> of June 1911. She concealed the militancy of her actions in order to retain the image of respectability within academia. Murray also pushed the <a href="professional%20boundaries">professional boundaries</a> for women throughout her own career, and mentored other women in archaeology and throughout academia. As women could not use the men's common room, she successfully campaigned for UCL to open a common room for women, and later ensured that a larger, better-equipped room was converted for the purpose; it was later renamed the Margaret Murray Room. At UCL, she became a friend of fellow female lecturer <a href="Winifred%20Smith">Winifred Smith</a>, and together they campaigned to improve the status and recognition of women in the university, with Murray becoming particularly annoyed at female staff who were afraid of upsetting or offending the male university establishment with their demands. Feeling that students should get nutritious yet affordable lunches, for many years she sat on the UCL Refectory Committee.

Various museums around the United Kingdom invited Murray to advise them on their Egyptological collections, resulting in her cataloguing the Egyptian artefacts owned by the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Ireland%20%E2%80%93%20Archaeology">Dublin National Museum</a>, the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Antiquities%20%28Scotland%29">National Museum of Antiquities</a> in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, and the <a href="Society%20of%20Antiquaries%20of%20Scotland">Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</a>, being elected a Fellow of the latter in thanks.
Petrie had established connections with the Egyptological wing of <a href="Manchester%20Museum">Manchester Museum</a> in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, and it was there that many of his finds had been housed. Murray thus often travelled to the museum to catalogue these artefacts, and during the 1906–07 school year regularly lectured there. In 1907, Petrie excavated the <a href="Tomb%20of%20two%20Brothers">Tomb of the Two Brothers</a>, a Middle Kingdom burial of two Egyptian priests, Nakht-ankh and Khnum-nakht, and it was decided that Murray would carry out the public unwrapping of the latter's mummified body. Taking place at the museum in May 1908, it represented the first time that a woman had led a public mummy unwrapping and was attended by over 500 onlookers, attracting press attention. Murray was particularly keen to emphasise the importance that the unwrapping would have for the scholarly understanding of the Middle Kingdom and its burial practices, and lashed out against members of the public who saw it as immoral; she declared that "every vestige of ancient remains must be carefully studied and recorded without sentimentality and without fear of the outcry of the ignorant". She subsequently published a book about her analysis of the two bodies, "The Tomb of the Two Brothers", which remained a key publication on Middle Kingdom mummification practices into the 21st century.
Murray was dedicated to public education, hoping to infuse <a href="Egyptomania">Egyptomania</a> with solid scholarship about Ancient Egypt, and to this end authored a series of books aimed at a general audience. In 1905 she published "Elementary Egyptian Grammar" which was followed in 1911 by "Elementary Coptic (Sahidic) Grammar". In 1913, she published "Ancient Egyptian Legends" for <a href="John%20Murray%20%28publisher%29">John Murray</a>'s "The Wisdom of the East" series. She was particularly pleased with the increased public interest in Egyptology that followed <a href="Howard%20Carter">Howard Carter</a>'s discovery of the tomb of Pharaoh <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a> in 1922. From at least 1911 until his death in 1940, Murray was a close friend of the anthropologist <a href="Charles%20Gabriel%20Seligman">Charles Gabriel Seligman</a> of the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a>, and together they co-authored a variety of papers on Egyptology that were aimed at an anthropological audience. Many of these dealt with subjects that Egyptological journals would not publish, such as the "Sa" sign for the <a href="uterus">uterus</a>, and thus were published in "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20Royal%20Anthropological%20Institute">Man</a>", the journal of the <a href="Royal%20Anthropological%20Institute">Royal Anthropological Institute</a>. It was at Seligman's recommendation that she was invited to become a member of the Institute in 1916.

In 1914, Petrie launched the academic journal "Ancient Egypt", published through his own <a href="British%20School%20of%20Archaeology%20in%20Egypt">British School of Archaeology in Egypt</a> (BSAE), which was based at UCL. Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt, Murray was left to operate as "de facto" editor much of the time. She also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews, particularly of the German-language publications which Petrie could not read.

The outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in 1914, in which the United Kingdom went to war against Germany and the Ottoman Empire, meant that Petrie and other staff members were unable to return to Egypt for excavation. Instead, Petrie and Murray spent much of the time reorganising the artefact collections that they had attained over the past decades. To aid Britain's war effort, Murray enrolled as a volunteer nurse in the Volunteer Air Detachment of the College Women's Union Society, and for several weeks was posted to <a href="Saint-Malo">Saint-Malo</a> in France. After being taken ill herself, she was sent to recuperate in <a href="Glastonbury">Glastonbury</a>, <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, where she became interested in <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury Abbey</a> and the folklore surrounding it which connected it to the legendary figure of <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a> and to the idea that the <a href="Holy%20Grail">Holy Grail</a> had been brought there by <a href="Joseph%20of%20Aramathea">Joseph of Aramathea</a>. Pursuing this interest, she published the paper "Egyptian Elements in the Grail Romance" in the journal "Ancient Egypt", although few agreed with her conclusions and it was criticised for making unsubstantiated leaps with the evidence by the likes of <a href="Jessie%20Weston">Jessie Weston</a>.

Murray's interest in folklore led her to develop an interest in the witch trials of Early Modern Europe. In 1917, she published a paper in "Folklore", the journal of the <a href="Folklore%20Society">Folklore Society</a>, in which she first articulated her version of the witch-cult theory, arguing that the witches persecuted in European history were actually followers of "a definite religion with beliefs, ritual, and organization as highly developed as that of any cult in the end". She followed this up with papers on the subject in the journals "Man" and the "<a href="Scottish%20Historical%20Review">Scottish Historical Review</a>". She articulated these views more fully in her 1921 book "<a href="The%20Witch-Cult%20in%20Western%20Europe">The Witch-Cult in Western Europe</a>", published by Oxford University Press after receiving a positive peer review by <a href="Henry%20Balfour">Henry Balfour</a>, and which received both criticism and support on publication. Many reviews in academic journals were critical, with historians claiming that she had distorted and misinterpreted the contemporary records that she was using, but the book was nevertheless influential.
As a result of her work in this area, she was invited to provide the entry on "witchcraft" for the fourteenth edition of the "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>" in 1929. She used the opportunity to propagate her own witch-cult theory, failing to mention the alternate theories proposed by other academics. Her entry would be included in the encyclopedia until 1969, becoming readily accessible to the public, and it was for this reason that her ideas on the subject had such a significant impact. It received a particularly enthusiastic reception by <a href="occultism">occultists</a> such as <a href="Dion%20Fortune">Dion Fortune</a>, <a href="Lewis%20Spence">Lewis Spence</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Shirley">Ralph Shirley</a>, and <a href="J.%20W.%20Brodie%20Innes">J. W. Brodie Innes</a>, perhaps because its claims regarding an ancient secret society chimed with similar claims common among various occult groups. Murray joined the Folklore Society in February 1927, and was elected to the society's council a month later, although she stood down in 1929. Murray reiterated her witch-cult theory in her 1933 book, "The God of the Witches", which was aimed at a wider, non-academic audience. In this book, she cut out or toned down what she saw as the more unpleasant aspects of the witch-cult, such as <a href="animal%20sacrifice">animal</a> and <a href="child%20sacrifice">child</a> sacrifice, and began describing the religion in more positive terms as "the Old Religion".

From 1921 to 1927, Murray led archaeological excavations on Malta, assisted by Edith Guest and <a href="Gertrude%20Caton%20Thompson">Gertrude Caton Thompson</a>. She excavated the Bronze Age <a href="megalithic">megalithic</a> monuments of <a href="Santa%20Sofia%20%28pre-historic%20site%29">Santa Sofia</a>, <a href="Santa%20Maria%20tal-Bakkari">Santa Maria tal-Bakkari</a>, <a href="G%C4%A7ar%20Dalam">Għar Dalam</a>, and <a href="Bor%C4%A1%20in-Nadur">Borġ in-Nadur</a>, all of which were threatened by the construction of a new aerodrome. In this she was funded by the <a href="Percy%20Sladen%20Memorial%20Trust">Percy Sladen Memorial Fund</a>. Her resulting three-volume excavation report came to be seen as an important publication within the field of Maltese archaeology. During the excavations, she had taken an interest in the island's folklore, resulting in the 1932 publication of her book "Maltese Folktales", much of which was a translation of earlier stories collected by Father Magri and her friend Liza Galea. In 1932 Murray returned to Malta to aid in the cataloguing of the Bronze Age pottery collection held in <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Archaeology%2C%20Malta">Malta Museum</a>, resulting in another publication, "Corpus of the Bronze Age Pottery of Malta".

On the basis of her work in Malta, <a href="L.%20C.%20G.%20Clarke">Louis C. G. Clarke</a>, the curator of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Archaeology%20and%20Anthropology%2C%20University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology</a>, invited her to lead excavations on the island of <a href="Menorca">Menorca</a> from 1930 to 1931. With the aid of Guest, she excavated the <a href="talaiotic%20culture">talaiotic</a> sites of <a href="Trepuc%C3%B3">Trepucó</a> and <a href="Sa%20Torreta%20de%20Tramuntana">Sa Torreta de Tramuntana</a>, resulting in the publication of "Cambridge Excavations in Minorca". Murray also continued to publish works on Egyptology for a general audience, such as "Egyptian Sculpture" (1930) and "Egyptian Temples" (1931), which received largely positive reviews. In the summer of 1925 she led a team of volunteers to excavate Homestead Moat in <a href="Whomerle%20Wood">Whomerle Wood</a> near to <a href="Stevenage">Stevenage</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>; she did not publish an excavation report and did not mention the event in her autobiography, with her motives for carrying out the excavation remaining unclear.

In 1924, UCL promoted Murray to the position of assistant professor, and in 1927 she was awarded an <a href="honorary%20doctorate">honorary doctorate</a> for her career in Egyptology. That year, Murray was tasked with guiding <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Mary of Teck</a>, the Queen consort, around the Egyptology department during the latter's visit to UCL. The pressures of teaching had eased by this point, allowing Murray to spend more time travelling internationally; in 1920 she returned to Egypt and in 1929 visited South Africa, where she attended the meeting of the <a href="British%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a>, whose theme was the prehistory of southern Africa. In the early 1930s she travelled to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, where she visited museums in <a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a>, <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, <a href="Kharkiv">Kharkiv</a>, and <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, and then in late 1935 she undertook a lecture tour of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Estonia.
Although having reached legal retirement age in 1927, and thus unable to be offered another five-year contract, Murray was reappointed on an annual basis each year until 1935. At this point, she retired, expressing the opinion that she was glad to leave UCL, for reasons that she did not make clear. In 1933, Petrie had retired from UCL and moved to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Mandatory Palestine</a> with his wife; Murray therefore took over as editor of the "Ancient Egypt" journal, renaming it "Ancient Egypt and the East" to reflect its increasing research interest in the ancient societies that surrounded and interacted with Egypt. The journal folded in 1935, perhaps due to Murray's retirement. Murray then spent some time in Jerusalem, where she aided the Petries in their excavation at <a href="Tall%20al-Ajjul">Tall al-Ajjul</a>, a Bronze Age mound south of <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a>.

During Murray's 1935 trip to Palestine, she had taken the opportunity to visit <a href="Petra">Petra</a> in neighbouring Jordan. Intrigued by the site, in March and April 1937 she returned in order to carry out a small excavation in several cave dwellings at the site, subsequently writing both an excavation report and a guidebook on Petra. Back in England, from 1934 to 1940, Murray aided the cataloguing of Egyptian antiquities at <a href="Girton%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Girton College, Cambridge</a>, and also gave lectures in Egyptology at the university until 1942.
During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Murray evaded <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a> of London by moving to Cambridge, where she volunteered for a group (probably the <a href="Army%20Bureau%20of%20Current%20Affairs">Army Bureau of Current Affairs</a> or <a href="Royal%20Army%20Educational%20Corps">The British Way and Purpose</a>) who educated military personnel to prepare them for post-war life. Based in the city, she embarked on research into the town's Early Modern history, examining documents stored in local parish churches, <a href="Downing%20College">Downing College</a>, and <a href="Ely%20Cathedral">Ely Cathedral</a>; she never published her findings. In 1945, she briefly became involved in the "<a href="Who%20put%20Bella%20in%20the%20Wych%20Elm%3F">Who put Bella in the Wych Elm?</a>" murder case.

After the war ended she returned to London, settling into a <a href="bedsit">bedsit</a> room in Endsleigh Street, which was close to University College London (UCL) and the <a href="UCL%20Institute%20of%20Archaeology">Institute of Archaeology</a> (then an independent institution, now part of UCL); she continued her involvement with the former and made use of the latter's library. On most days she visited the British Museum in order to consult their library, and twice a week she taught adult education classes on Ancient Egyptian history and religion at the <a href="City%20Literary%20Institute">City Literary Institute</a>; upon her retirement from this position she nominated her former pupil, <a href="Veronica%20Seton-Williams">Veronica Seton-Williams</a>, to replace her.

Murray's interest in popularising Egyptology among the wider public continued; in 1949 she published "Ancient Egyptian Religious Poetry", her second work for John Murray's "The Wisdom of the East" series. That same year she also published "The Splendour That Was Egypt", in which she collated many of her UCL lectures. The book adopted a <a href="Trans-cultural%20diffusion">diffusionist perspective</a> that argued that Egypt influenced Greco-Roman society and thus modern Western society. This was seen as a compromise between Petrie's belief that other societies influenced the emergence of Egyptian civilisation and <a href="Grafton%20Elliot%20Smith">Grafton Elliot Smith</a>'s highly unorthodox and heavily criticised <a href="Hyperdiffusionism%20in%20archaeology">hyperdiffusionist</a> view that Egypt was the source of all global civilisation. The book received a mixed reception from the archaeological community.

In 1953, Murray was appointed to the presidency of the Folklore Society following the resignation of former president Allan Gomme. The Society had initially approached <a href="John%20Mavrogordato">John Mavrogordato</a> for the post, but he had declined, with Murray accepting the nomination several months later. Murray remained President for two terms, until 1955. In her 1954 presidential address, "England as a Field for Folklore Research", she lamented what she saw as the English people's disinterest in their own folklore in favour of that from other nations. For the autumn 1961 issue of "Folklore", the society published a "<a href="festschrift">festschrift</a>" to Murray to commemorate her 98th birthday. The issue contained contributions from various scholars paying tribute to her – with papers dealing with archaeology, fairies, Near Eastern religious symbols, Greek folk songs – but notably not about witchcraft, potentially because no other folklorists were willing to defend her witch-cult theory.

In May 1957, Murray had championed the archaeologist <a href="T.%20C.%20Lethbridge">T. C. Lethbridge</a>'s controversial claims that he had discovered three pre-Christian chalk <a href="hill%20figure">hill figure</a>s on <a href="Wandlebury%20Hill">Wandlebury Hill</a> in the <a href="Gog%20Magog%20Hills">Gog Magog Hills</a>, Cambridgeshire. Privately she expressed concern about the reality of the figures. Lethbridge subsequently authored a book championing her witch-cult theory in which he sought the cult's origins in pre-Christian culture. In 1960, she donated her collection of papers – including correspondences with a wide range of individuals across the country – to the Folklore Society Archive, where it is now known as "the Murray Collection".

Crippled with <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a>, Murray had moved into a home in <a href="North%20Finchley">North Finchley</a>, north London, where she was cared for by a retired couple who were trained nurses; from here she occasionally took taxis into central London to visit the UCL library.
Amid failing health, in 1962 Murray moved into the <a href="Queen%20Victoria%20Memorial%20Hospital">Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital</a> in <a href="Welwyn">Welwyn</a>, <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>, where she could receive 24-hour care; she lived here for the final 18 months of her life. To mark her hundredth birthday, on 13 July 1963 a group of her friends, former students, and doctors gathered for a party at nearby <a href="Ayot%20St.%20Lawrence">Ayot St. Lawrence</a>. Two days later, her doctor drove her to UCL for a second birthday party, again attended by many of her friends, colleagues, and former students; it was the last time that she visited the university. In "Man", the journal of the <a href="Royal%20Anthropological%20Institute">Royal Anthropological Institute</a>, it was noted that Murray was "the only Fellow of the Institute to [reach their centenary] within living memory, if not in its whole history". That year she published two books; one was "The Genesis of Religion", in which she argued that humanity's first deities had been goddesses rather than male gods. The second was her autobiography, "My First Hundred Years", which received predominantly positive reviews. She died on 13 November 1963, and her body was cremated.

The later folklorists Caroline Oates and Juliette Wood have suggested that Murray was best known for her witch-cult theory, with biographer Margaret S. Drower expressing the view that it was her work on this subject which "perhaps more than any other, made her known to the general public". It has been claimed that Murray's was the "first feminist study of the witch trials", as well as being the first to have actually "empowered the witches" by giving the (largely female) accused both <a href="free%20will">free will</a> and a voice distinct from that of their interrogators. The theory was faulty, in part because all of her academic training was in Egyptology, with no background knowledge in European history, but also because she exhibited a "tendency to generalize wildly on the basis of very slender evidence". Oates and Wood, however, noted that Murray's interpretations of the evidence fitted within wider perspectives on the past that existed at the time, stating that "Murray was far from isolated in her method of reading ancient ritual origins into later myths". In particular, her approach was influenced by the work of the anthropologist <a href="James%20Frazer">James Frazer</a>, who had argued for the existence of a pervasive <a href="Dying-and-rising%20god">dying-and-resurrecting god myth</a>, and she was also influenced by the interpretative approaches of E. O. James, <a href="Karl%20Pearson">Karl Pearson</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Fleure">Herbert Fleure</a>, and <a href="Harold%20Peake">Harold Peake</a>.

In "The Witch-Cult in Western Europe", Murray stated that she had restricted her research to Great Britain, although made some recourse to sources from France, Flanders, and <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. She drew a division between what she termed "Operative Witchcraft", which referred to the performance of charms and spells with any purpose, and "Ritual Witchcraft", by which she meant "the ancient religion of Western Europe", a fertility-based faith that she also termed "the Dianic cult". She claimed that the cult had "very probably" once been devoted to the worship of both a male deity and a "Mother Goddess" but that "at the time when the cult is recorded the worship of the male deity appears to have superseded that of the female". In her argument, Murray claimed that the figure referred to as the Devil in the trial accounts was the witches' god, "manifest and incarnate", to whom the witches offered their prayers. She claimed that at the witches' meetings, the god would be personified, usually by a man or at times by a woman or an animal; when a human personified this entity, Murray claimed that they were usually dressed plainly, though they appeared in full costume for the witches' Sabbaths.

Members joined the cult either as children or adults through what Murray called "admission ceremonies"; Murray asserted that applicants had to agree to join of their own free will, and agree to devote themselves to the service of their deity. She also claimed that in some cases, these individuals had to sign a covenant or were baptised into the faith. At the same time, she claimed that the religion was largely passed down hereditary lines. Murray described the religion as being divided into <a href="coven">coven</a>s containing thirteen members, led by a coven officer who was often termed the "Devil" in the trial accounts, but who was accountable to a "Grand Master". According to Murray, the records of the coven were kept in a secret book, with the coven also disciplining its members, to the extent of executing those deemed traitors.

Describing this witch-cult as "a joyous religion", she claimed that the two primary festivals that it celebrated were on May Eve and November Eve, although that other dates of religious observation were 1 February and 1 August, the winter and summer solstices, and Easter. She asserted that the "General Meeting of all members of the religion" were known as Sabbaths, while the more private ritual meetings were known as Esbats. The Esbats, Murray claimed, were nocturnal rites that began at midnight, and were "primarily for business, whereas the Sabbath was purely religious". At the former, magical rites were performed both for malevolent and benevolent ends. She also asserted that the Sabbath ceremonies involved the witches paying homage to the deity, renewing their "vows of fidelity and obedience" to him, and providing him with accounts of all the magical actions that they had conducted since the previous Sabbath. Once this business had been concluded, admissions to the cult or marriages were conducted, ceremonies and fertility rites took place, and then the Sabbath ended with feasting and dancing.
Deeming Ritual Witchcraft to be "a fertility cult", she asserted that many of its rites were designed to ensure fertility and rain-making. She claimed that there were four types of sacrifice performed by the witches: blood-sacrifice, in which the neophyte writes their name in blood; the sacrifice of animals; the sacrifice of a non-Christian child to procure magical powers; and the sacrifice of the witches' god by fire to ensure fertility.
She interpreted accounts of witches shapeshifting into various animals as being representative of a rite in which the witches dressed as specific animals which they took to be sacred. She asserted that accounts of <a href="familiar">familiar</a>s were based on the witches' use of animals, which she divided into "divining familiars" used in <a href="divination">divination</a> and "domestic familiars" used in other magic rites.

Murray asserted that a pre-Christian fertility-based religion had survived the Christianization process in Britain, although that it came to be "practised only in certain places and among certain classes of the community". She believed that folkloric stories of fairies in Britain were based on a surviving race of dwarfs, who continued to live on the island up until the Early Modern period. She asserted that this race followed the same pagan religion as the witches, thus explaining the folkloric connection between the two. In the appendices to the book, she also alleged that <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a> and <a href="Gilles%20de%20Rais">Gilles de Rais</a> were members of the witch-cult and were executed for it, a claim which has been refuted by historians, especially in the case of Joan of Arc.

The later historian <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> commented that "The Witch-Cult in Western Europe" "rested upon a small amount of archival research, with extensive use of printed trial records in 19th-century editions, plus early modern pamphlets and works of demonology". He also noted that the book's tone was generally "dry and clinical, and every assertion was meticulously footnoted to a source, with lavish quotation". It was not a bestseller; in its first thirty years, only 2,020 copies were sold. However, it led many people to treat Murray as an authority on the subject; in 1929, she was invited to provide the entry on "Witchcraft" for the "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>", and used it to present her interpretation of the subject as if it were universally accepted in scholarship. It remained in the encyclopedia until being replaced in 1969.

Murray followed "The Witch-Cult in Western Europe" with "The God of the Witches", published by the popular press <a href="Sampson%20Low">Sampson Low</a> in 1931; although similar in content, unlike her previous volume it was aimed at a mass market audience. The tone of the book also differed strongly from its predecessor, containing "emotionally inflated [language] and coloured with religious phraseology" and repeatedly referring to the witch-cult as "the Old Religion". In this book she also "cut out or toned down" many of the claims made in her previous volume which would have painted the cult in a bad light, such as those which discussed sex and the sacrifice of animals and children.

In this book she began to refer to the witches' deity as the <a href="Horned%20God">Horned God</a>, and asserted that it was an entity who had been worshipped in Europe since the <a href="Palaeolithic">Palaeolithic</a>.
She further asserted that in the Bronze Age, the worship of the deity could be found throughout Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, claiming that the depiction of various horned figures from these societies proved that. Among the evidence cited were the horned figures found at <a href="Mohenjo-Daro">Mohenjo-Daro</a>, which are often interpreted as depictions of <a href="Pashupati">Pashupati</a>, as well as the deities <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> and <a href="Amun">Amon</a> in Egypt and the <a href="Minotaur">Minotaur</a> of <a href="Minoan%20Crete">Minoan Crete</a>. Within continental Europe, she claimed that the Horned God was represented by <a href="Pan%20%28mythology%29">Pan</a> in Greece, <a href="Cernunnos">Cernunnos</a> in Gaul, and in various Scandinavian rock carvings. Claiming that this divinity had been declared the Devil by the Christian authorities, she nevertheless asserted that his worship was testified in officially Christian societies right through to the Modern period, citing folkloric practices such as the <a href="Dorset%20Ooser">Dorset Ooser</a> and the <a href="Puck%20Fair">Puck Fair</a> as evidence of his veneration.

In 1954, she published "The Divine King in England", in which she greatly extended on the theory, taking influence from Frazer's "<a href="The%20Golden%20Bough">The Golden Bough</a>", an anthropological book that made the claim that societies all over the world sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature. In her book, she claimed that this practice had continued into medieval England, and that, for instance, the death of <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William II</a> was really a ritual sacrifice.
No academic took the book seriously, and it was ignored by many of her supporters.

Upon initial publication, Murray's thesis gained a favourable reception from many readers, including some significant scholars, albeit none who were experts in the witch trials. Historians of Early Modern Britain like <a href="George%20Norman%20Clark">George Norman Clark</a> and <a href="Christopher%20Hill%20%28historian%29">Christopher Hill</a> incorporated her theories into their work, although the latter subsequently distanced himself from the theory. For the 1961 reprint of "The Witch-Cult in Western Europe", the Medieval historian <a href="Steven%20Runciman">Steven Runciman</a> provided a foreword in which he accepted that some of Murray's "minor details may be open to criticism", but in which he was otherwise supportive of her thesis. Her theories were recapitulated by <a href="Arno%20Runeberg">Arno Runeberg</a> in his 1947 book "Witches, Demons and Fertility Magic" as well as <a href="Pennethorne%20Hughes">Pennethorne Hughes</a> in his 1952 book "Witches". As a result, the Canadian historian Elliot Rose, writing in 1962, claimed that the Murrayite interpretations of the witch trials "seem to hold, at the time of writing, an almost undisputed sway at the higher intellectual levels", being widely accepted among "educated people".

Rose suggested that the reason that Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her "imposing credentials" as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers. He further suggested that the Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed "the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or <a href="Robert%20Graves">[Robert] Graves</a> would be familiar with". Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory's popularity was because it "appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age", including "the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets", the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals. At the same time, Hutton suggested, it seemed more plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion. Related to this, the folklorist <a href="Jacqueline%20Simpson">Jacqueline Simpson</a> suggested that part of the Murrayite theory's appeal was that it appeared to give a "sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument" between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like <a href="Montague%20Summers">Montague Summers</a>, who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers. "How refreshing", noted the historian <a href="Hilda%20Ellis%20Davidson">Hilda Ellis Davidson</a>, "and exciting her first book was "at that period". A new approach, and such a surprising one."

Murray's theories never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials, and from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her "factual errors and methodological failings". Indeed, the majority of scholarly reviews of her work produced during the 1920s and 1930s were largely critical. George L. Burr reviewed both of her initial books on the witch-cult for the "<a href="American%20Historical%20Review">American Historical Review</a>". He stated that she was not acquainted with the "careful general histories by modern scholars" and criticised her for assuming that the trial accounts accurately reflected the accused witches' genuine experiences of witchcraft, regardless of whether those confessions had been obtained through torture and coercion. He also charged her with selectively using the evidence to serve her interpretation, for instance by omitting any supernatural or miraculous events that appear in the trial accounts. W. R. Halliday was highly critical in his review for "Folklore", as was E. M. Loeb in his review for "<a href="American%20Anthropologist">American Anthropologist</a>".

Soon after, one of the foremost specialists of the trial records, L'Estrange Ewen, brought out a series of books which rejected Murray's interpretation.
Rose suggested that Murray's books on the witch-cult "contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning". He accepted that her case "could, perhaps, still be proved by somebody else, though I very much doubt it". Highlighting that there is a gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he argues that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period. He further criticises Murray for treating pre-Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality, it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. He also challenges Murray's claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as "a view grounded on ignorance alone".

Murray did not respond directly to the criticisms of her work, but reacted to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work, and believed that her critics were simply acting out of their own Christian prejudices to non-Christian religion.
Simpson noted that despite these critical reviews, within the field of British <a href="folkloristics">folkloristics</a> Murray's theories were permitted "to pass unapproved but unchallenged, either out of politeness or because nobody was really interested enough to research the topic". As evidence, she noted that no substantial research articles on the subject of witchcraft were published in "Folklore" between Murray's in 1917 and <a href="Rossell%20Hope%20Robbins">Rossell Hope Robbins</a>' in 1963. She also highlighted that when regional studies of British folklore were published in this period by folklorists like <a href="Theo%20Brown">Theo Brown</a>, <a href="Ruth%20Tongue">Ruth Tongue</a>, or <a href="Enid%20Porter">Enid Porter</a>, none adopted the Murrayite framework for interpreting witchcraft beliefs, thus evidencing her claim that Murray's theories were widely ignored by scholars of folkloristics.

Murray's work was increasingly criticised following her death in 1963, with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch-cult theory occurring during the 1970s. During these decades, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America – such as <a href="Alan%20Macfarlane">Alan Macfarlane</a>, Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo – published in-depth studies of the archival records from the witch trials, leaving no doubt that those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre-Christian religion.
In 1971, the English historian <a href="Keith%20Thomas%20%28historian%29">Keith Thomas</a> stated that on the basis of this research, there was "very little evidence to suggest that the accused witches were either devil-worshippers or members of a pagan fertility cult". He stated that Murray's conclusions were "almost totally groundless" because she ignored the systematic study of the trial accounts provided by Ewen and instead used sources very selectively to argue her point.

In 1975, the historian <a href="Norman%20Cohn">Norman Cohn</a> commented that Murray's "knowledge of European history, even of English history, was superficial and her grasp of <a href="historical%20method">historical method</a> was non-existent", adding that her ideas were "firmly set in an exaggerated and distorted version of the Frazerian mould". That same year, the historian of religion <a href="Mircea%20Eliade">Mircea Eliade</a> described Murray's work as "hopelessly inadequate", containing "numberless and appalling errors". In 1996, the feminist historian <a href="Diane%20Purkiss">Diane Purkiss</a> stated that although Murray's thesis was "intrinsically improbable" and commanded "little or no allegiance within the modern academy", she felt that male scholars like Thomas, Cohn, and Macfarlane had unfairly adopted an androcentric approach by which they contrasted their own, male and methodologically sound interpretation against Murray's "feminised belief" about the witch-cult.

Hutton stated that Murray had treated her source material with "reckless abandon", in that she had taken "vivid details of alleged witch practices" from "sources scattered across a great extent of space and time" and then declared them to be normative of the cult as a whole. Simpson outlined how Murray had selected her use of evidence very specifically, particularly by ignoring and/or rationalising any accounts of supernatural or miraculous events in the trial records, thereby distorting the events that she was describing. Thus, Simpson pointed out, Murray rationalised claims that the cloven-hoofed Devil appeared at the witches' Sabbath by stating that he was a man with a special kind of shoe, and similarly asserted that witches' claims to have flown through the air on broomsticks were actually based on their practice of either hopping along on broomsticks or smearing hallucinogenic salves onto themselves. Concurring with this assessment, the historian <a href="Jeffrey%20Burton%20Russell">Jeffrey Burton Russell</a>, writing with the independent author Brooks Alexander, stated that "Murray's use of sources, in general, is appalling". The pair went on to claim that "today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong – she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises".

The Italian historian <a href="Carlo%20Ginzburg">Carlo Ginzburg</a> has been cited as being willing to give "some slight support" to Murray's theory. Ginzburg stated that although her thesis had been "formulated in a wholly uncritical way" and contained "serious defects", it did contain "a kernel of truth". He stated his opinion that she was right in claiming that European witchcraft had "roots in an ancient fertility cult", something that he argued was vindicated by his work researching the "<a href="benandanti">benandanti</a>", an agrarian visionary tradition recorded in the <a href="Friuli">Friuli</a> district of Northeastern Italy during the 16th and 17th centuries. Several historians and folklorists have pointed out that Ginzburg's arguments are very different to Murray's: whereas Murray argued for the existence of a pre-Christian witches' cult whose members physically met during the witches' Sabbaths, Ginzburg argued that some of the European visionary traditions that were conflated with witchcraft in the Early Modern period had their origins in pre-Christian fertility religions. Moreover, other historians have expressed criticism of Ginzburg's interpretation of the "benandanti"; Cohn stated that there was "nothing whatsoever" in the source material to justify the idea that the "benandanti" were the "survival of an age-old fertility cult". Echoing these views, Hutton commented that Ginzburg's claim that the "benandanti" visionary traditions were a survival from pre-Christian practices was an idea resting on "imperfect material and conceptual foundations". He added that Ginzburg's "assumption" that "what was being dreamed about in the sixteenth century had in fact been acted out in religious ceremonies" dating to "pagan times", was entirely "an inference of his own" and not one supported by the documentary evidence.

On researching the history of UCL's Egyptology department, the historian Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was "remembered with gratitude and immense affection by all her former students. A wise and witty teacher, two generations of Egyptologists have forever been in her debt." Alongside teaching them, Murray was known to socialise with her UCL students outside of class hours. The archaeologist <a href="Ralph%20Merrifield">Ralph Merrifield</a>, who knew Murray through the Folklore Society, described her as a "diminutive and kindly scholar, who radiated intelligence and strength of character into extreme old age". Davidson, who also knew Murray through the Society, noted that at their meetings "she would sit near the front, a bent and seemingly guileless old lady dozing peacefully, and then in the middle of a discussion would suddenly intervene with a relevant and penetrating comment which showed that she had missed not one word of the argument". The later folklorist Juliette Wood noted that many members of the Folklore Society "remember her fondly", adding that Murray had been "especially keen to encourage younger researchers, even those who disagreed with her ideas".

One of Murray's friends in the Society, <a href="E.%20O.%20James">E. O. James</a>, described her as a "mine of information and a perpetual inspiration ever ready to impart her vast and varied stores of specialised knowledge without reserve, or, be it said, much if any regard for the generally accepted opinions and conclusions of the experts!" Davidson described her as being "not at all assertive ... [she] never thrust her ideas on anyone. [In relation to her witch-cult theory,] she behaved in fact rather like someone who was a fully convinced member of some unusual religious sect, or perhaps, of the <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasons</a>, but never on any account got into arguments about it in public." The archaeologist <a href="Glyn%20Daniel">Glyn Daniel</a> observed that Murray remained mentally alert into her old age, commenting that "her vigour and forthrightness and ruthless energy never deserted her".

Murray never married, instead devoting her life to her work, and for this reason, Hutton drew comparisons between her and two other prominent female British scholars of the period, <a href="Jane%20Ellen%20Harrison">Jane Harrison</a> and <a href="Jessie%20Weston">Jessie Weston</a>. Murray's biographer Kathleen L. Sheppard stated that she was deeply committed to public outreach, particularly when it came to Egyptology, and that as such she "wanted to change the means by which the public obtained knowledge about Egypt's history: she wished to throw open the doors to the scientific laboratory and invite the public in". She considered travel to be one of her favourite activities, although due to restraints on her time and finances she was unable to do this regularly; her salary remained small and the revenue from her books was meagre.

Raised a devout Christian by her mother, Murray had initially become a <a href="Sunday%20School">Sunday School</a> teacher to preach the faith, but after entering the academic profession she rejected religion, gaining a reputation among other members of the Folklore Society as a noted <a href="scepticism">sceptic</a> and a <a href="rationalism">rationalist</a>. She was openly critical of organised religion, although continued to maintain a personal belief in a <a href="God">God</a> of some sort, relating in her autobiography that she believed in "an unseen over-ruling Power", "which science calls Nature and religion calls God".
She was also a believer and a practitioner of <a href="Magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a>, performing <a href="curse">curse</a>s against those she felt deserved it; in one case she cursed a fellow academic, <a href="Jaroslav%20%C4%8Cern%C3%BD%20%28Egyptologist%29">Jaroslav Černý</a>, when she felt that his promotion to the position of Professor of Egyptology over her friend <a href="Walter%20Bryan%20Emery">Walter Bryan Emery</a> was unworthy. Her curse entailed mixing up ingredients in a frying pan, and was undertaken in the presence of two colleagues. In another instance, she was claimed to have created a wax image of <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> and then melted it during the First World War.

Hutton noted that Murray was one of the earliest women to "make a serious impact upon the world of professional scholarship", and the archaeologist Niall Finneran described her as "one of the greatest characters of post-war British archaeology". Upon her death, Daniel referred to her as "the Grand Old Woman of Egyptology", with Hutton noting that Egyptology represented "the core of her academic career". In 2014, Thornton referred to her as "one of Britain's most famous Egyptologists". However, according to the archaeologist Ruth Whitehouse, Murray's contributions to archaeology and Egyptology were often overlooked as her work was overshadowed by that of Petrie, to the extent that she was often thought of primarily as one of Petrie's assistants rather than as a scholar in her own right. By her retirement she had come to be highly regarded within the discipline, although, according to Whitehouse, Murray's reputation declined following her death, something that Whitehouse attributed to the rejection of her witch-cult theory and the general erasure of women archaeologists from the discipline's male-dominated history.

In his obituary for Murray in "Folklore", James noted that her death was "an event of unusual interest and importance in the annals of the Folk-Lore Society in particular as well as in the wider sphere in which her influence was felt in so many directions and
disciplines". However, later academic folklorists, such as Simpson and Wood, have cited Murray and her witch-cult theory as an embarrassment to their field, and to the Folklore Society specifically. Simpson suggested that Murray's position as President of the Society was a causal factor in the mistrustful attitude that many historians held toward folkloristics as an academic discipline, as they erroneously came to believe that all folklorists endorsed Murray's ideas. Similarly, Catherine Noble stated that "Murray caused considerable damage to the study of witchcraft".

In 1935, UCL introduced the Margaret Murray Prize, awarded to the student who is deemed to have produced the best dissertation in Egyptology; it continued to be presented annually into the 21st century. In 1969, UCL named one of their common rooms in her honour, but it was converted into an office in 1989. In June 1983, <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother</a> visited the room and there was gifted a copy of Murray's "My First Hundred Years". UCL also hold two busts of Murray, one kept in the <a href="Petrie%20Museum">Petrie Museum</a> and the other in the library of the UCL Institute of Archaeology. This sculpture was commissioned by one of her students, <a href="Violet%20MacDermot">Violet MacDermot</a>, and produced by the artist <a href="Stephen%20Rickard">Stephen Rickard</a>. UCL also possess a watercolour painting of Murray by <a href="Winifred%20Brunton">Winifred Brunton</a>; formerly exhibited in the Petrie Gallery, it was later placed into the Art Collection stores.
In 2013, on the 150th anniversary of Murray's birth and the 50th of her death, the UCL Institute of Archaeology's Ruth Whitehouse described Murray as "a remarkable woman" whose life was "well worth celebrating, both in the archaeological world at large and especially in UCL".

The historian of archaeology Rosalind M. Janssen titled her study of Egyptology at UCL "The First Hundred Years" "as a tribute" to Murray. Murray's friend <a href="Margaret%20Stefana%20Drower">Margaret Stefana Drower</a> authored a short biography of her, which was included as a chapter in the 2004 edited volume on "Breaking Ground: Pioneering Women Archaeologists". In 2013, <a href="Lexington%20Books">Lexington Books</a> published "The Life of Margaret Alice Murray: A Woman's Work in Archaeology", a biography of Murray authored by Kathleen L. Sheppard, then an assistant professor at <a href="Missouri%20University%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology">Missouri University of Science and Technology</a>; the book was based upon Sheppard's doctoral dissertation produced at the <a href="University%20of%20Oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</a>. Although characterising it as being "written in a clear and engaging manner", one reviewer noted that Sheppard's book focuses on Murray the "scientist" and as such neglects to discuss Murray's involvement in magical practices and her relationship with Wicca.

Murray's witch-cult theories provided the blueprint for the <a href="Paganism%20%28contemporary%29">contemporary Pagan</a> religion of <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>, with Murray being referred to as the "Grandmother of Wicca". The <a href="Pagan%20studies">Pagan studies</a> scholar Ethan Doyle White stated that it was the theory which "formed the historical narrative around which Wicca built itself", for on its emergence in England during the 1940s and 1950s, Wicca claimed to be the survival of this witch-cult. Wicca's theological structure, revolving around a Horned God and Mother Goddess, was adopted from Murray's ideas about the ancient witch-cult, and Wiccan groups were named "covens" and their meetings termed "esbats", both words that Murray had popularised. As with Murray's witch-cult, Wicca's practitioners entered via an initiation ceremony; Murray's claims that witches wrote down their spells in a book may have been an influence on Wicca's <a href="Book%20of%20Shadows">Book of Shadows</a>. Wicca's early <a href="Wheel%20of%20the%20Year">system of seasonal festivities</a> were also based on Murray's framework.

Noting that there is no evidence of Wicca existing before the publication of Murray's books, Merrifield commented that for those in 20th century Britain who wished to form their own witches' covens, "Murray may have seemed the ideal fairy godmother, and her theory became the pumpkin coach that could transport them into the realm of fantasy for which they longed". The historian <a href="Philip%20Heselton">Philip Heselton</a> suggested that the <a href="New%20Forest%20coven">New Forest coven</a> – the oldest alleged Wiccan group – was founded "circa" 1935 by esotericists aware of Murray's theory and who may have believed themselves to be reincarnated witch-cult members. It was <a href="Gerald%20Gardner%20%28Wiccan%29">Gerald Gardner</a>, who claimed to be an initiate of the New Forest coven, who established the tradition of <a href="Gardnerian%20Wicca">Gardnerian Wicca</a> and popularised the religion; according to Simpson, Gardner was the only member of the Folklore Society to "wholeheartedly" accept Murray's witch-cult hypothesis. The duo knew each other, with Murray writing the foreword to Gardner's 1954 book "<a href="Witchcraft%20Today">Witchcraft Today</a>", although in that foreword she did not explicitly specify whether she believed Gardner's claim that he had discovered a survival of her witch-cult. In 2005, Noble suggested that "Murray's name might be all but forgotten today if it were not for Gerald Gardner".

Murray's witch-cult theories were likely also a core influence on the non-Gardnerian Wiccan traditions that were established in Britain and Australia between 1930 and 1970 by the likes of <a href="Bob%20Clay-Egerton">Bob Clay-Egerton</a>, <a href="Robert%20Cochrane%20%28witch%29">Robert Cochrane</a>, <a href="Charles%20Cardell">Charles Cardell</a>, and <a href="Rosaleen%20Norton">Rosaleen Norton</a>.
The prominent Wiccan <a href="Doreen%20Valiente">Doreen Valiente</a> eagerly searched for what she believed were other surviving remnants of the Murrayite witch-cult around Britain. Valiente remained committed to a belief in Murray's witch-cult after its academic rejection, and she described Murray as "a remarkable woman". In <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> during the late 1960s, Murray's writings were among the sources used by <a href="Aidan%20A.%20Kelly">Aidan A. Kelly</a> in the creation of his Wiccan tradition, the <a href="New%20Reformed%20Orthodox%20Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Dawn">New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn</a>. In <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> during the early 1970s, they were used by <a href="Zsuzsanna%20Budapest">Zsuzsanna Budapest</a> when she was establishing her feminist-oriented tradition of <a href="Dianic%20Wicca">Dianic Wicca</a>. The Murrayite witch-cult theory also provided the basis for the ideas espoused in "Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture", a 1978 book written by the American <a href="gay%20liberation">gay liberation</a> activist <a href="Arthur%20Evans%20%28author%29">Arthur Evans</a>.

Members of the Wiccan community gradually became aware of academia's rejection of the witch-cult theory. Accordingly, belief in its literal truth declined during the 1980s and 1990s, with many Wiccans instead coming to view it as a myth that conveyed metaphorical or symbolic truths. Others insisted that the historical origins of the religion did not matter and that instead Wicca was legitimated by the spiritual experiences it gave to its participants. In response, Hutton authored "<a href="The%20Triumph%20of%20the%20Moon">The Triumph of the Moon</a>", a historical study exploring Wicca's early development; on publication in 1999 the book exerted a strong impact on the British Pagan community, further eroding belief in the Murrayite theory among Wiccans. Conversely, other practitioners clung on to the theory, treating it as an important <a href="article%20of%20faith">article of faith</a> and rejecting post-Murrayite scholarship on European witchcraft. Several prominent practitioners continued to insist that Wicca was a religion with origins stretching back to the Palaeolithic, but others rejected the validity of historical scholarship and emphasised intuition and emotion as the arbiter of truth. A few "counter-revisionist" Wiccans – among them <a href="Donald%20H.%20Frew">Donald H. Frew</a>, Jani Farrell-Roberts, and Ben Whitmore – published critiques in which they attacked post-Murrayite scholarship on matters of detail, but none defended Murray's original hypothesis completely.

Simpson noted that the publication of the Murray thesis in the "Encyclopædia Britannica" made it accessible to "journalists, film-makers popular novelists and thriller writers", who adopted it "enthusiastically". It influenced the work of <a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> and <a href="Robert%20Graves">Robert Graves</a>. It was also an influence on the American horror author <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>, who cited "The Witch-Cult in Western Europe" in his writings about the fictional cult of <a href="Cthulhu">Cthulhu</a>.

The author <a href="Sylvia%20Townsend%20Warner">Sylvia Townsend Warner</a> cited Murray's work on the witch-cult as an influence on her 1926 novel "<a href="Lolly%20Willowes">Lolly Willowes</a>", and sent a copy of her book to Murray in appreciation, with the two meeting for lunch shortly after. There was nevertheless some difference in their depictions of the witch-cult; whereas Murray had depicted an organised pre-Christian cult, Warner depicted a vague family tradition that was explicitly Satanic.
In 1927, Warner lectured on the subject of witchcraft, exhibiting a strong influence from Murray's work. Analysing the relationship between Murray and Warner, the English literature scholar Mimi Winick characterised both as being "engaged in imagining new possibilities for women in modernity".

A bibliography of Murray's published work was published in "Folklore" by <a href="Wilfrid%20Bonser">Wilfrid Bonser</a> in 1961, and her friend Drower produced a posthumous limited bibliography in 2004, and another limited bibliography appeared in Kathleen L. Sheppard's 2013 biography of her.

Metabolism

Metabolism (, from "metabolē", "change") is the set of <a href="life">life</a>-sustaining <a href="chemical%20reactions">chemical reactions</a> in <a href="organisms">organisms</a>. The three main purposes of metabolism are: the conversion of food to <a href="energy">energy</a> to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to building blocks for <a href="protein">protein</a>s, <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s, <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s, and some <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s; and the elimination of <a href="Metabolic%20waste%23Nitrogen%20wastes">nitrogenous wastes</a>. These <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. (The word metabolism can also refer to the sum of all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including <a href="digestion">digestion</a> and the transport of substances into and between different cells, in which case the above described set of reactions within the cells is called intermediary metabolism or intermediate metabolism).

Metabolic reactions may be categorized as "<a href="catabolic">catabolic</a>" - the "breaking down" of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by <a href="cellular%20respiration">cellular respiration</a>); or "<a href="anabolic">anabolic</a>" - the "building up" (<a href="biosynthesis">synthesis</a>) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy.

The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a>s, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require <a href="energy">energy</a> that will not occur by themselves, by <a href="Coupling%20%28physics%29">coupling</a> them to <a href="spontaneous%20process">spontaneous reactions</a> that release energy. Enzymes act as <a href="Catalysis">catalysts</a> - they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly - and they also allow the <a href="Metabolic%20pathway%23Regulation">regulation</a> of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cell's</a> environment or to <a href="cell%20signaling">signals</a> from other cells.

The metabolic system of a particular organism determines which substances it will find <a href="nutrition">nutritious</a> and which <a href="poison">poison</a>ous. For example, some <a href="prokaryote">prokaryote</a>s use <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals. The <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a> of an organism is the measure of the amount of energy consumed by all of these chemical reactions. 

A striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic pathways among vastly different species. For example, the set of <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s that are best known as the intermediates in the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a> are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the <a href="Unicellular%20organism">unicellular</a> bacterium "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>" and huge <a href="multicellular%20organism">multicellular organism</a>s like <a href="elephant">elephant</a>s. These similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in <a href="evolutionary%20history%20of%20life">evolutionary history</a>, and their retention because of their <a href="efficacy">efficacy</a>.

Most of the structures that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of <a href="molecule">molecule</a>: <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s and <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s (often called <a href="fat">fat</a>s). As these molecules are vital for life, metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or by breaking them down and using them as a source of energy, by their digestion. These biochemicals can be joined together to make <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s such as <a href="DNA">DNA</a> and <a href="protein">protein</a>s, essential <a href="macromolecules">macromolecules</a> of life.
<a href="Protein">Protein</a>s are made of <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s arranged in a linear chain joined together by <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>s. Many proteins are <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s that <a href="catalysis">catalyze</a> the chemical reactions in metabolism. Other proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as those that form the <a href="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a>, a system of <a href="scaffolding">scaffolding</a> that maintains the cell shape. Proteins are also important in <a href="cell%20signaling">cell signaling</a>, <a href="antibody">immune responses</a>, <a href="cell%20adhesion">cell adhesion</a>, <a href="active%20transport">active transport</a> across membranes, and the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a>. Amino acids also contribute to cellular energy metabolism by providing a carbon source for entry into the citric acid cycle (<a href="tricarboxylic%20acid%20cycle">tricarboxylic acid cycle</a>), especially when a primary source of energy, such as <a href="glucose">glucose</a>, is scarce, or when cells undergo metabolic stress.

<a href="Lipid">Lipid</a>s are the most diverse group of biochemicals. Their main structural uses are as part of <a href="biological%20membrane">biological membrane</a>s both internal and external, such as the <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>, or as a source of energy. Lipids are usually defined as <a href="hydrophobe">hydrophobic</a> or <a href="amphiphiles">amphipathic</a> biological molecules but will dissolve in <a href="organic%20solvent">organic solvent</a>s such as <a href="benzene">benzene</a> or <a href="chloroform">chloroform</a>. The <a href="fat">fat</a>s are a large group of compounds that contain <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s and <a href="glycerol">glycerol</a>; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid <a href="ester">ester</a>s is called a <a href="triglyceride">triacylglyceride</a>. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as <a href="sphingosine">sphingosine</a> in the <a href="sphingolipid">sphingolipid</a>s, and <a href="hydrophile">hydrophilic</a> groups such as <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> as in <a href="phospholipid">phospholipid</a>s. <a href="Steroid">Steroid</a>s such as <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> are another major class of lipids.

<a href="Carbohydrate">Carbohydrate</a>s are <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a>s or <a href="ketone">ketone</a>s, with many <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates are the most abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the storage and transport of <a href="energy">energy</a> (<a href="starch">starch</a>, <a href="glycogen">glycogen</a>) and structural components (<a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> in plants, <a href="chitin">chitin</a> in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called <a href="monosaccharide">monosaccharide</a>s and include <a href="galactose">galactose</a>, <a href="fructose">fructose</a>, and most importantly <a href="glucose">glucose</a>. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s in almost limitless ways.

The two nucleic acids, DNA and <a href="RNA">RNA</a>, are polymers of <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a>s. Each nucleotide is composed of a phosphate attached to a <a href="ribose">ribose</a> or <a href="deoxyribose">deoxyribose</a> sugar group which is attached to a <a href="nitrogenous%20base">nitrogenous base</a>. Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of <a href="transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a> and <a href="protein%20biosynthesis">protein biosynthesis</a>. This information is protected by <a href="DNA%20repair">DNA repair</a> mechanisms and propagated through <a href="DNA%20replication">DNA replication</a>. Many <a href="virus">virus</a>es have an <a href="RNA%20virus">RNA genome</a>, such as <a href="HIV">HIV</a>, which uses <a href="reverse%20transcription">reverse transcription</a> to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in <a href="ribozyme">ribozyme</a>s such as <a href="spliceosome">spliceosome</a>s and <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual <a href="nucleoside">nucleoside</a>s are made by attaching a <a href="nucleobase">nucleobase</a> to a <a href="ribose">ribose</a> sugar. These bases are <a href="heterocyclic">heterocyclic</a> rings containing nitrogen, classified as <a href="purine">purine</a>s or <a href="pyrimidine">pyrimidine</a>s. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.

Metabolism involves a vast array of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a>s of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called <a href="coenzyme">coenzyme</a>s. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the <a href="substrate%20%28biochemistry%29">substrate</a> for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.

One central coenzyme is <a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate</a> (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide is used to transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There is only a small amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between <a href="catabolism">catabolism</a> and <a href="anabolism">anabolism</a>. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and anabolic reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> reactions.

A <a href="vitamin">vitamin</a> is an organic compound needed in small quantities that cannot be made in cells. In human <a href="nutrition">nutrition</a>, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. <a href="Nicotinamide%20adenine%20dinucleotide">Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide</a> (NAD), a derivative of vitamin B (<a href="niacin">niacin</a>), is an important coenzyme that acts as a hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of <a href="dehydrogenase">dehydrogenase</a>s remove electrons from their substrates and <a href="redox">reduce</a> NAD into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the <a href="reductase">reductase</a>s in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.

Inorganic elements play critical roles in metabolism; some are abundant (e.g. <a href="sodium">sodium</a> and <a href="potassium">potassium</a>) while others function at minute concentrations. About 99% of a mammal's mass is made up of the elements <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> and <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>. <a href="Organic%20compound">Organic compound</a>s (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen; most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.

The abundant inorganic elements act as <a href="ion">ion</a>ic <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a>s. The most important ions are <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="chloride">chloride</a>, <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> and the organic ion <a href="bicarbonate">bicarbonate</a>. The maintenance of precise <a href="ion%20gradient">ion gradient</a>s across <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>s maintains <a href="osmotic%20pressure">osmotic pressure</a> and <a href="pH">pH</a>. Ions are also critical for <a href="nerve">nerve</a> and <a href="muscle">muscle</a> function, as <a href="action%20potential">action potential</a>s in these tissues are produced by the exchange of electrolytes between the <a href="extracellular%20fluid">extracellular fluid</a> and the cell's fluid, the <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a>. Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called <a href="ion%20channel">ion channel</a>s. For example, <a href="muscle%20contraction">muscle contraction</a> depends upon the movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and <a href="T-tubule">T-tubule</a>s.

<a href="Transition%20metal">Transition metal</a>s are usually present as <a href="trace%20element">trace element</a>s in organisms, with <a href="zinc">zinc</a> and <a href="iron">iron</a> being most abundant of those. These metals are used in some proteins as <a href="Cofactor%20%28biochemistry%29">cofactors</a> and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as <a href="catalase">catalase</a> and oxygen-carrier proteins such as <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>. Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis, they always return to their original state by the end of the reaction catalyzed. Metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bind to storage proteins such as <a href="ferritin">ferritin</a> or <a href="metallothionein">metallothionein</a> when not in use.

<a href="Catabolism">Catabolism</a> is the set of metabolic processes that break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their <a href="primary%20nutritional%20groups">primary nutritional groups</a>), as shown in the table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by <a href="organotroph">organotroph</a>s, while <a href="lithotroph">lithotroph</a>s use inorganic substrates, and <a href="phototroph">phototroph</a>s capture sunlight as <a href="Potential%20energy%23Chemical%20potential%20energy">chemical energy</a>. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on <a href="redox">redox</a> reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as <a href="organic%20molecule">organic molecule</a>s, water, <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>, <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> or <a href="Ferrous">ferrous ions</a> to acceptor molecules such as <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a> or <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a>. In animals, these reactions involve complex <a href="organic%20molecule">organic molecule</a>s that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and water. In <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> organisms, such as plants and <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.

The most common set of catabolic reactions in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as <a href="protein">protein</a>s, <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s or <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually <a href="acetyl-CoA">acetyl coenzyme A</a> (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and carbon dioxide in the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a> and <a href="electron%20transport%20chain">electron transport chain</a>, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme <a href="nicotinamide%20adenine%20dinucleotide">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide</a> (NAD) into NADH.

Macromolecules such as starch, cellulose or proteins cannot be rapidly taken up by cells and must be broken into their smaller units before they can be used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These <a href="digestive%20enzyme">digestive enzyme</a>s include <a href="protease">protease</a>s that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as <a href="glycoside%20hydrolase">glycoside hydrolase</a>s that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as <a href="monosaccharides">monosaccharides</a>.

Microbes simply secrete digestive enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their <a href="Gastrointestinal%20tract">guts</a>, including the <a href="stomach">stomach</a> and <a href="pancreas">pancreas</a>, and <a href="salivary%20gland">salivary gland</a>s. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by <a href="active%20transport">active transport</a> proteins.
Carbohydrate catabolism is the breakdown of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into <a href="monosaccharide">monosaccharide</a>s. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a>, where sugars such as <a href="glucose">glucose</a> and <a href="fructose">fructose</a> are converted into <a href="pyruvic%20acid">pyruvate</a> and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to <a href="acetyl-CoA">acetyl-CoA</a> through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a>. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces <a href="lactic%20acid">lactate</a>, through the enzyme <a href="lactate%20dehydrogenase">lactate dehydrogenase</a> re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the <a href="pentose%20phosphate%20pathway">pentose phosphate pathway</a>, which reduces the coenzyme <a href="NADPH">NADPH</a> and produces <a href="pentose">pentose</a> sugars such as <a href="ribose">ribose</a>, the sugar component of <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s.

Fats are catabolised by <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> to free fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by <a href="beta%20oxidation">beta oxidation</a> to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all be used by the cell for energy. "M. tuberculosis" can also grow on the lipid <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of "M. tuberculosis".

<a href="Amino%20acid">Amino acid</a>s are either used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to <a href="urea">urea</a> and carbon dioxide as a source of energy. The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a <a href="transaminase">transaminase</a>. The amino group is fed into the <a href="urea%20cycle">urea cycle</a>, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton in the form of a <a href="keto%20acid">keto acid</a>. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a> forms α-<a href="alpha-Ketoglutaric%20acid">ketoglutarate</a>. The <a href="glucogenic%20amino%20acid">glucogenic amino acid</a>s can also be converted into glucose, through <a href="gluconeogenesis">gluconeogenesis</a> (discussed below).

In oxidative phosphorylation, the electrons removed from organic molecules in areas such as the protagon acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released is used to make ATP. This is done in <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s by a series of proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the <a href="electron%20transport%20chain">electron transport chain</a>. In <a href="prokaryote">prokaryote</a>s, these proteins are found in the cell's <a href="bacterial%20cell%20structure">inner membrane</a>. These proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from <a href="reducing%20agent">reduced</a> molecules like NADH onto <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> to pump <a href="proton">proton</a>s across a membrane.

Pumping protons out of the mitochondria creates a proton <a href="diffusion">concentration difference</a> across the membrane and generates an <a href="electrochemical%20gradient">electrochemical gradient</a>. This force drives protons back into the mitochondrion through the base of an enzyme called <a href="ATP%20synthase">ATP synthase</a>. The flow of protons makes the stalk subunit rotate, causing the <a href="active%20site">active site</a> of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate <a href="adenosine%20diphosphate">adenosine diphosphate</a> – turning it into ATP.

<a href="Chemolithotroph">Chemolithotroph</a>y is a type of metabolism found in <a href="prokaryote">prokaryote</a>s where energy is obtained from the oxidation of <a href="inorganic%20compound">inorganic compound</a>s. These organisms can use <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, reduced <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> compounds (such as <a href="sulfide">sulfide</a>, <a href="hydrogen%20sulfide">hydrogen sulfide</a> and <a href="thiosulfate">thiosulfate</a>), <a href="Iron%28II%29%20oxide">ferrous iron (FeII)</a> or <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> or <a href="nitrite">nitrite</a>. These microbial processes are important in global <a href="biogeochemical%20cycle">biogeochemical cycle</a>s such as <a href="acetogenesis">acetogenesis</a>, <a href="nitrification">nitrification</a> and <a href="denitrification">denitrification</a> and are critical for <a href="fertility%20%28soil%29">soil fertility</a>.

The energy in sunlight is captured by <a href="plant">plant</a>s, <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, <a href="purple%20bacteria">purple bacteria</a>, <a href="green%20sulfur%20bacteria">green sulfur bacteria</a> and some <a href="protist">protist</a>s. This process is often coupled to the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight as a source of energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.

In many organisms the capture of solar energy is similar in principle to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called <a href="photosynthetic%20reaction%20centre">photosynthetic reaction centre</a>s or <a href="rhodopsin">rhodopsin</a>s. Reaction centers are classed into two types depending on the type of <a href="photosynthetic%20pigment">photosynthetic pigment</a> present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.

In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, <a href="photosystem">photosystem II</a> uses light energy to remove electrons from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then flow to the <a href="cytochrome%20b6f%20complex">cytochrome b6f complex</a>, which uses their energy to pump protons across the <a href="thylakoid">thylakoid</a> membrane in the <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>. These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through <a href="photosystem">photosystem I</a> and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP, for use in the <a href="Calvin%20cycle">Calvin cycle</a>, which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.

Anabolism is the set of constructive metabolic processes where the energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of precursors such as <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, <a href="monosaccharide">monosaccharide</a>s, <a href="Terpenoid">isoprenoids</a> and <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a>s, secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as <a href="protein">protein</a>s, <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s, <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s and <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s.

Organisms differ according to the number of constructed molecules in their cells. <a href="Autotroph">Autotroph</a>s such as plants can construct the complex organic molecules in cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and water. <a href="Heterotroph">Heterotroph</a>s, on the other hand, require a source of more complex substances, such as monosaccharides and amino acids, to produce these complex molecules. Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy: photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light, whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions.

Photosynthesis is the synthesis of carbohydrates from sunlight and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the <a href="photosynthetic%20reaction%20centre">photosynthetic reaction centre</a>s, as described above, to convert CO into <a href="glycerate%203-phosphate">glycerate 3-phosphate</a>, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is carried out by the enzyme <a href="RuBisCO">RuBisCO</a> as part of the <a href="Calvin%20cycle">Calvin – Benson cycle</a>. Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, <a href="C3%20carbon%20fixation">C3 carbon fixation</a>, <a href="C4%20carbon%20fixation">C4 carbon fixation</a> and <a href="Crassulacean%20acid%20metabolism">CAM photosynthesis</a>. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.

In photosynthetic <a href="prokaryote">prokaryote</a>s the mechanisms of carbon fixation are more diverse. Here, carbon dioxide can be fixed by the Calvin – Benson cycle, a <a href="Reverse%20Krebs%20cycle">reversed citric acid</a> cycle, or the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. Prokaryotic <a href="Chemotroph">chemoautotrophs</a> also fix CO through the Calvin – Benson cycle, but use energy from inorganic compounds to drive the reaction.

In carbohydrate anabolism, simple organic acids can be converted into <a href="monosaccharide">monosaccharide</a>s such as <a href="glucose">glucose</a> and then used to assemble <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s such as <a href="starch">starch</a>. The generation of <a href="glucose">glucose</a> from compounds like <a href="pyruvate">pyruvate</a>, <a href="lactic%20acid">lactate</a>, <a href="glycerol">glycerol</a>, <a href="glycerate%203-phosphate">glycerate 3-phosphate</a> and <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s is called <a href="gluconeogenesis">gluconeogenesis</a>. Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to <a href="glucose-6-phosphate">glucose-6-phosphate</a> through a series of intermediates, many of which are shared with <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a>. However, this pathway is not simply <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a> run in reverse, as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes. This is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately, and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a <a href="futile%20cycle">futile cycle</a>.

Although fat is a common way of storing energy, in <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s such as humans the <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through <a href="gluconeogenesis">gluconeogenesis</a> as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into <a href="pyruvate">pyruvate</a>; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce <a href="Ketone%20body">ketone bodies</a> from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty acids. In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the <a href="glyoxylate%20cycle">glyoxylate cycle</a>, which bypasses the <a href="decarboxylation">decarboxylation</a> step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to <a href="oxaloacetate">oxaloacetate</a>, where it can be used for the production of glucose.

Polysaccharides and <a href="glycan">glycan</a>s are made by the sequential addition of monosaccharides by <a href="glycosyltransferase">glycosyltransferase</a> from a reactive sugar-phosphate donor such as <a href="uridine%20diphosphate%20glucose">uridine diphosphate glucose</a> (UDP-glucose) to an acceptor <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> group on the growing polysaccharide. As any of the <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> groups on the ring of the substrate can be acceptors, the polysaccharides produced can have straight or branched structures. The polysaccharides produced can have structural or metabolic functions themselves, or be transferred to lipids and proteins by enzymes called <a href="oligosaccharyltransferase">oligosaccharyltransferase</a>s.

Fatty acids are made by <a href="fatty%20acid%20synthase">fatty acid synthase</a>s that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, <a href="dehydration%20reaction">dehydrate</a> it to an <a href="alkene">alkene</a> group and then reduce it again to an <a href="alkane">alkane</a> group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while in plant <a href="plastid">plastid</a>s and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.

<a href="Terpene">Terpene</a>s and <a href="terpenoid">isoprenoids</a> are a large class of lipids that include the <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a>s and form the largest class of plant <a href="natural%20product">natural product</a>s. These compounds are made by the assembly and modification of <a href="isoprene">isoprene</a> units donated from the reactive precursors <a href="isopentenyl%20pyrophosphate">isopentenyl pyrophosphate</a> and <a href="dimethylallyl%20pyrophosphate">dimethylallyl pyrophosphate</a>. These precursors can be made in different ways. In animals and archaea, the <a href="mevalonate%20pathway">mevalonate pathway</a> produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the <a href="non-mevalonate%20pathway">non-mevalonate pathway</a> uses pyruvate and <a href="glyceraldehyde%203-phosphate">glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate</a> as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is <a href="steroid%20biosynthesis">steroid biosynthesis</a>. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make <a href="squalene">squalene</a> and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make <a href="lanosterol">lanosterol</a>. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> and <a href="ergosterol">ergosterol</a>.

Organisms vary in their ability to synthesize the 20 common amino acids. Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty, but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids, so nine <a href="essential%20amino%20acid">essential amino acid</a>s must be obtained from food. Some simple <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s, such as the bacteria "<a href="Mycoplasma%20pneumoniae">Mycoplasma pneumoniae</a>", lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts. All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate pathway. Nitrogen is provided by <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a> and <a href="glutamine">glutamine</a>. Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha-keto acid, which is then <a href="Transaminase">transaminated</a> to form an amino acid.

Amino acids are made into proteins by being joined together in a chain of <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>s. Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues: this is its <a href="primary%20structure">primary structure</a>. Just as the letters of the alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words, amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins. Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a <a href="transfer%20RNA">transfer RNA</a> molecule through an <a href="ester">ester</a> bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA precursor is produced in an <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a>-dependent reaction carried out by an <a href="aminoacyl%20tRNA%20synthetase">aminoacyl tRNA synthetase</a>. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>, which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain, using the sequence information in a <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a>.

Nucleotides are made from amino acids, carbon dioxide and <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a> in pathways that require large amounts of metabolic energy. Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides. <a href="Purine">Purine</a>s are synthesized as <a href="nucleoside">nucleoside</a>s (bases attached to <a href="ribose">ribose</a>). Both <a href="adenine">adenine</a> and <a href="guanine">guanine</a> are made from the precursor nucleoside <a href="inosine">inosine</a> monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids <a href="glycine">glycine</a>, <a href="glutamine">glutamine</a>, and <a href="aspartic%20acid">aspartic acid</a>, as well as <a href="formate">formate</a> transferred from the <a href="coenzyme">coenzyme</a> <a href="folic%20acid">tetrahydrofolate</a>. <a href="Pyrimidine">Pyrimidine</a>s, on the other hand, are synthesized from the base <a href="Pyrimidinecarboxylic%20acid">orotate</a>, which is formed from glutamine and aspartate.

All organisms are constantly exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods and would be harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called <a href="xenobiotic">xenobiotic</a>s. Xenobiotics such as <a href="drug">synthetic drugs</a>, <a href="poison">natural poisons</a> and <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s are detoxified by a set of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include <a href="cytochrome%20P450">cytochrome P450 oxidases</a>, <a href="Glucuronosyltransferase">UDP-glucuronosyltransferases</a>, and <a href="glutathione%20S-transferase">glutathione "S"-transferases</a>. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In <a href="ecology">ecology</a>, these reactions are particularly important in microbial <a href="biodegradation">biodegradation</a> of pollutants and the <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a> of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even <a href="persistent%20organic%20pollutant">persistent organic pollutant</a>s such as <a href="organochloride">organochloride</a> compounds.

A related problem for <a href="aerobic%20organism">aerobic organism</a>s is <a href="oxidative%20stress">oxidative stress</a>. Here, processes including <a href="oxidative%20phosphorylation">oxidative phosphorylation</a> and the formation of <a href="disulfide%20bond">disulfide bond</a>s during <a href="protein%20folding">protein folding</a> produce <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen species</a> such as <a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a>. These damaging oxidants are removed by <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> metabolites such as <a href="glutathione">glutathione</a> and enzymes such as <a href="catalase">catalase</a>s and <a href="peroxidase">peroxidase</a>s.

Living organisms must obey the <a href="laws%20of%20thermodynamics">laws of thermodynamics</a>, which describe the transfer of heat and <a href="work%20%28thermodynamics%29">work</a>. The <a href="second%20law%20of%20thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics</a> states that in any <a href="closed%20system">closed system</a>, the amount of <a href="entropy">entropy</a> (disorder) cannot decrease. Although living organisms' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law, life is possible as all organisms are <a href="open%20system%20%28systems%20theory%29">open systems</a> that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. Thus living systems are not in <a href="Thermodynamic%20equilibrium">equilibrium</a>, but instead are <a href="dissipative%20system">dissipative system</a>s that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments. The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the <a href="spontaneous%20process">spontaneous process</a>es of catabolism to the non-spontaneous processes of anabolism. In <a href="non-equilibrium%20thermodynamics">thermodynamic</a> terms, metabolism maintains order by creating disorder.

As the environments of most organisms are constantly changing, the reactions of metabolism must be finely <a href="Control%20theory">regulated</a> to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called <a href="homeostasis">homeostasis</a>. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the "regulation" of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the "control" exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the <a href="flux">flux</a> through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity ("i.e." it is highly regulated) but if these changes have little effect on the flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.
There are multiple levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates to respond to changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the <a href="flux">flux</a> through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves <a href="allosteric%20regulation">allosteric regulation</a> of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as <a href="hormone">hormone</a>s and <a href="growth%20factor">growth factor</a>s and are detected by specific <a href="receptor%20%28biochemistry%29">receptors</a> on the cell surface. These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by <a href="second%20messenger%20system">second messenger system</a>s that often involved the <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> of proteins.

A very well understood example of extrinsic control is the regulation of glucose metabolism by the hormone <a href="insulin">insulin</a>. Insulin is produced in response to rises in <a href="blood%20sugar">blood glucose levels</a>. Binding of the hormone to <a href="insulin%20receptor">insulin receptor</a>s on cells then activates a cascade of <a href="protein%20kinase">protein kinase</a>s that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and <a href="glycogen">glycogen</a>. The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of <a href="phosphorylase">phosphorylase</a>, the enzyme that breaks down glycogen, and <a href="glycogen%20synthase">glycogen synthase</a>, the enzyme that makes it. These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion, with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase, but activating phosphorylase. Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating <a href="phosphatase">protein phosphatases</a> and producing a decrease in the phosphorylation of these enzymes.

The central pathways of metabolism described above, such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, are present in all <a href="Three-domain%20system">three domains</a> of living things and were present in the <a href="last%20universal%20common%20ancestor">last universal common ancestor</a>. This universal ancestral cell was <a href="prokaryote">prokaryotic</a> and probably a <a href="methanogen">methanogen</a> that had extensive amino acid, nucleotide, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The retention of these ancient pathways during later <a href="evolution">evolution</a> may be the result of these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems, with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps. The first pathways of enzyme-based metabolism may have been parts of <a href="purine">purine</a> nucleotide metabolism, while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient <a href="RNA%20world%20hypothesis">RNA world</a>.

Many models have been proposed to describe the mechanisms by which novel metabolic pathways evolve. These include the sequential addition of novel enzymes to a short ancestral pathway, the duplication and then divergence of entire pathways as well as the recruitment of pre-existing enzymes and their assembly into a novel reaction pathway. The relative importance of these mechanisms is unclear, but genomic studies have shown that enzymes in a pathway are likely to have a shared ancestry, suggesting that many pathways have evolved in a step-by-step fashion with novel functions created from pre-existing steps in the pathway. An alternative model comes from studies that trace the evolution of proteins' structures in metabolic networks, this has suggested that enzymes are pervasively recruited, borrowing enzymes to perform similar functions in different metabolic pathways (evident in the <a href="MANET%20database">MANET database</a>) These recruitment processes result in an evolutionary enzymatic mosaic. A third possibility is that some parts of metabolism might exist as "modules" that can be reused in different pathways and perform similar functions on different molecules.

As well as the evolution of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a>. Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in <a href="endosymbiont">endosymbiotic</a> organisms.

Classically, metabolism is studied by a <a href="reductionism">reductionist</a> approach that focuses on a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable is the use of <a href="radioactive%20tracer">radioactive tracer</a>s at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be <a href="protein%20purification">purified</a> and their <a href="enzyme%20kinetics">kinetics</a> and responses to <a href="enzyme%20inhibitor">inhibitors</a> investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the <a href="metabolome">metabolome</a>. Overall, these studies give a good view of the structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.

An idea of the complexity of the <a href="metabolic%20network">metabolic network</a>s in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more <a href="Holism">holistic</a> mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a> from <a href="proteomics">proteomic</a> and <a href="DNA%20microarray">DNA microarray</a> studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in <a href="Network%20theory">network analysis</a>, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.

Bacterial metabolic networks are a striking example of <a href="Bow%20tie%20%28biology%29">bow-tie</a> organization, an architecture able to input a wide range of nutrients and produce a large variety of products and complex macromolecules using a relatively few intermediate common currencies.

A major technological application of this information is <a href="metabolic%20engineering">metabolic engineering</a>. Here, organisms such as <a href="yeast">yeast</a>, plants or <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> are genetically modified to make them more useful in <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a> and aid the production of <a href="drug">drug</a>s such as <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s or industrial chemicals such as <a href="1%2C3-Propanediol">1,3-propanediol</a> and <a href="shikimic%20acid">shikimic acid</a>. These genetic modifications usually aim to reduce the amount of energy used to produce the product, increase yields and reduce the production of wastes.

The term "metabolism" is derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> Μεταβολισμός – "Metabolismos" for "change", or "overthrow".

<a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s "<a href="The%20Parts%20of%20Animals">The Parts of Animals</a>" sets out enough details of <a href="Aristotle%27s%20biology">his views on metabolism</a> for an open flow model to be made. He believed that at each stage of the process, materials from food were transformed, with heat being released as the <a href="classical%20element">classical element</a> of fire, and residual materials being excreted as urine, bile, or faeces.

<a href="Ibn%20al-Nafis">Ibn al-Nafis</a> described metabolism in his 1260 AD work titled <a href="Al-Risalah%20al-Kamiliyyah%20fil%20Siera%20al-Nabawiyyah">Al-Risalah al-Kamiliyyah fil Siera al-Nabawiyyah</a> (The Treatise of Kamil on the Prophet's Biography) which included the following phrase "Both the body and its parts are in a continuous state of dissolution and nourishment, so they are inevitably undergoing permanent change."

The history of the scientific study of metabolism spans several centuries and has moved from examining whole animals in early studies, to examining individual metabolic reactions in modern biochemistry. The first controlled <a href="experiment">experiment</a>s in human metabolism were published by <a href="Santorio%20Santorio">Santorio Santorio</a> in 1614 in his book "Ars de statica medicina". He described how he weighed himself before and after eating, <a href="sleeping">sleep</a>, working, sex, fasting, drinking, and excreting. He found that most of the food he took in was lost through what he called "insensible perspiration".

In these early studies, the mechanisms of these metabolic processes had not been identified and a <a href="vitalism">vital force</a> was thought to animate living tissue. In the 19th century, when studying the <a href="fermentation%20%28food%29">fermentation</a> of sugar to <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a> by <a href="yeast">yeast</a>, <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> concluded that fermentation was catalyzed by substances within the yeast cells he called "ferments". He wrote that "alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells, not with the death or putrefaction of the cells." This discovery, along with the publication by <a href="Friedrich%20Woehler">Friedrich Wöhler</a> in 1828 of a paper on the chemical synthesis of <a href="urea">urea</a>, and is notable for being the first organic compound prepared from wholly inorganic precursors. This proved that the organic compounds and chemical reactions found in cells were no different in principle than any other part of chemistry.

It was the discovery of <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s at the beginning of the 20th century by <a href="Eduard%20Buchner">Eduard Buchner</a> that separated the study of the chemical reactions of metabolism from the biological study of cells, and marked the beginnings of <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>. The mass of biochemical knowledge grew rapidly throughout the early 20th century. One of the most prolific of these modern biochemists was <a href="Hans%20Adolf%20Krebs">Hans Krebs</a> who made huge contributions to the study of metabolism. He discovered the urea cycle and later, working with <a href="Hans%20Kornberg">Hans Kornberg</a>, the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle. Modern biochemical research has been greatly aided by the development of new techniques such as <a href="chromatography">chromatography</a>, <a href="X-ray%20diffraction">X-ray diffraction</a>, <a href="NMR%20spectroscopy">NMR spectroscopy</a>, <a href="radioisotopic%20labelling">radioisotopic labelling</a>, <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscopy</a> and <a href="molecular%20dynamics">molecular dynamics</a> simulations. These techniques have allowed the discovery and detailed analysis of the many molecules and metabolic pathways in cells.

M-theory

M-theory is a theory in <a href="physics">physics</a> that unifies all consistent versions of <a href="superstring%20theory">superstring theory</a>. The existence of such a theory was first conjectured by <a href="Edward%20Witten">Edward Witten</a> at a <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a> conference at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> in the spring of 1995. Witten's announcement initiated a flurry of research activity known as the <a href="second%20superstring%20revolution">second superstring revolution</a>.

Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had identified five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, to be very different, work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in intricate and nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called <a href="S-duality">S-duality</a> and <a href="T-duality">T-duality</a>. Witten's conjecture was based in part on the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string theories to a <a href="field%20theory%20%28physics%29">field theory</a> called eleven-dimensional <a href="supergravity">supergravity</a>.

Although a complete formulation of M-theory is not known, the theory should describe two- and five-dimensional objects called <a href="branes">branes</a> and should be approximated by eleven-dimensional supergravity at low <a href="energy">energies</a>. Modern attempts to formulate M-theory are typically based on <a href="matrix%20theory%20%28physics%29">matrix theory</a> or the <a href="AdS/CFT%20correspondence">AdS/CFT correspondence</a>.

According to Witten, M should stand for “magic”, “mystery”, or “membrane” according to taste, and the true meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known.

Investigations of the mathematical structure of M-theory have spawned important theoretical results in physics and mathematics. More speculatively, M-theory may provide a framework for developing a <a href="theory%20of%20everything">unified theory</a> of all of the <a href="fundamental%20force">fundamental force</a>s of nature. Attempts to connect M-theory to experiment typically focus on <a href="compactification%20%28physics%29">compactifying</a> its <a href="extra%20dimension">extra dimension</a>s to construct candidate models of our four-dimensional world, although so far none has been verified to give rise to physics as observed in high energy physics experiments.

One of the deepest problems in modern physics is the problem of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravity</a>. The current understanding of <a href="gravity">gravity</a> is based on <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s <a href="general%20theory%20of%20relativity">general theory of relativity</a>, which is formulated within the framework of <a href="classical%20physics">classical physics</a>. However, <a href="fundamental%20interaction">nongravitational forces</a> are described within the framework of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on <a href="probability">probability</a>. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity.

<a href="String%20theory">String theory</a> is a <a href="mathematical%20theory">theoretical framework</a> that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the <a href="point%20particle">point-like particles</a> of <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a> are replaced by <a href="one-dimensional">one-dimensional</a> objects called <a href="string%20%28physics%29">strings</a>. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, there is only one kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its <a href="mass">mass</a>, <a href="charge%20%28physics%29">charge</a>, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the <a href="graviton">graviton</a>, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.

There are several versions of string theory: <a href="type%20I%20string">type I</a>, <a href="type%20IIA%20string">type IIA</a>, <a href="type%20IIB%20string">type IIB</a>, and two flavors of <a href="heterotic%20string">heterotic string</a> theory (<a href="special%20orthogonal%20group"></a> and <a href="E8%20%28mathematics%29"></a>). The different theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different <a href="symmetry%20%28physics%29">symmetries</a>. For example, the type I theory includes both open strings (which are segments with endpoints) and closed strings (which form closed loops), while types IIA and IIB include only closed strings. Each of these five string theories arises as a special limiting case of M-theory. This theory, like its string theory predecessors, is an example of a quantum theory of gravity. It describes a <a href="force%20%28physics%29">force</a> just like the familiar gravitational force subject to the rules of quantum mechanics.

In everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's general theory of relativity treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a>, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed as a consequence of the geometry of spacetime.

In spite of the fact that the universe is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in <a href="condensed%20matter%20physics">condensed matter physics</a>. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.

One notable feature of string theory and M-theory is that these theories require <a href="extra%20dimensions">extra dimensions</a> of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In string theory, spacetime is "ten-dimensional" (nine spatial dimensions, and one time dimension), while in M-theory it is "eleven-dimensional" (ten spatial dimensions, and one time dimension). In order to describe real physical phenomena using these theories, one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments.

<a href="Compactification%20%28physics%29">Compactification</a> is one way of modifying the number of dimensions in a physical theory. In compactification, some of the extra dimensions are assumed to "close up" on themselves to form circles. In the limit where these curled up dimensions become very small, one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions. A standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling on the surface of the hose would move in two dimensions.

Theories that arise as different limits of M-theory turn out to be related in highly nontrivial ways. One of the relationships that can exist between these different physical theories is called <a href="S-duality">S-duality</a>. This is a relationship which says that a collection of strongly interacting particles in one theory can, in some cases, be viewed as a collection of weakly interacting particles in a completely different theory. Roughly speaking, a collection of particles is said to be strongly interacting if they combine and decay often and weakly interacting if they do so infrequently. Type I string theory turns out to be equivalent by S-duality to the heterotic string theory. Similarly, type IIB string theory is related to itself in a nontrivial way by S-duality.

Another relationship between different string theories is <a href="T-duality">T-duality</a>. Here one considers strings propagating around a circular extra dimension. T-duality states that a string propagating around a circle of radius is equivalent to a string propagating around a circle of radius in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, a string has <a href="momentum">momentum</a> as it propagates around a circle, and it can also wind around the circle one or more times. The number of times the string winds around a circle is called the <a href="winding%20number">winding number</a>. If a string has momentum and winding number in one description, it will have momentum and winding number in the dual description. For example, type IIA string theory is equivalent to type IIB string theory via T-duality, and the two versions of heterotic string theory are also related by T-duality.

In general, the term "duality" refers to a situation where two seemingly different <a href="physical%20system">physical system</a>s turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be "dual" to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.

Another important theoretical idea that plays a role in M-theory is <a href="supersymmetry">supersymmetry</a>. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called <a href="bosons">bosons</a> and a class of particles called <a href="fermions">fermions</a>. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. When supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical theory that includes gravity. Such a theory is called a <a href="supergravity%20theory">supergravity theory</a>.

A theory of strings that incorporates the idea of supersymmetry is called a <a href="superstring%20theory">superstring theory</a>. There are several different versions of superstring theory which are all subsumed within the M-theory framework. At low <a href="energy">energies</a>, the superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime dimensions. Similarly, M-theory is approximated at low energies by supergravity in eleven dimensions.

In string theory and related theories such as supergravity theories, a <a href="brane">brane</a> is a physical object that generalizes the notion of a point particle to higher dimensions. For example, a point particle can be viewed as a brane of dimension zero, while a string can be viewed as a brane of dimension one. It is also possible to consider higher-dimensional branes. In dimension , these are called -branes. Branes are dynamical objects which can propagate through spacetime according to the rules of quantum mechanics. They can have mass and other attributes such as charge. A -brane sweeps out a -dimensional volume in spacetime called its "worldvolume". Physicists often study <a href="field%20%28physics%29">fields</a> analogous to the <a href="electromagnetic%20field">electromagnetic field</a> which live on the worldvolume of a brane. The word brane comes from the word "membrane" which refers to a two-dimensional brane.

In string theory, the fundamental objects that give rise to elementary particles are the one-dimensional strings. Although the physical phenomena described by M-theory are still poorly understood, physicists know that the theory describes two- and five-dimensional branes. Much of the current research in M-theory attempts to better understand the properties of these branes.

In the early 20th century, physicists and mathematicians including Albert Einstein and <a href="Hermann%20Minkowski">Hermann Minkowski</a> pioneered the use of four-dimensional geometry for describing the physical world. These efforts culminated in the formulation of Einstein's general theory of relativity, which relates gravity to the geometry of four-dimensional spacetime.

The success of general relativity led to efforts to apply higher dimensional geometry to explain other forces. In 1919, work by <a href="Theodor%20Kaluza">Theodor Kaluza</a> showed that by passing to five-dimensional spacetime, one can unify gravity and <a href="electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a> into a single force. This idea was improved by physicist <a href="Oskar%20Klein">Oskar Klein</a>, who suggested that the additional dimension proposed by Kaluza could take the form of a circle with radius around cm.

The <a href="Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein%20theory">Kaluza–Klein theory</a> and subsequent attempts by Einstein to develop <a href="unified%20field%20theory">unified field theory</a> were never completely successful. In part this was because Kaluza–Klein theory predicted a particle that has never been shown to exist, and in part because it was unable to correctly predict the ratio of an electron's mass to its charge. In addition, these theories were being developed just as other physicists were beginning to discover quantum mechanics, which would ultimately prove successful in describing known forces such as electromagnetism, as well as new <a href="nuclear%20force">nuclear force</a>s that were being discovered throughout the middle part of the century. Thus it would take almost fifty years for the idea of new dimensions to be taken seriously again.

New concepts and mathematical tools provided fresh insights into general relativity, giving rise to a period in the 1960s–70s now known as the <a href="history%20of%20general%20relativity">golden age of general relativity</a>. In the mid-1970s, physicists began studying higher-dimensional theories combining general relativity with supersymmetry, the so-called supergravity theories.

General relativity does not place any limits on the possible dimensions of spacetime. Although the theory is typically formulated in four dimensions, one can write down the same equations for the gravitational field in any number of dimensions. Supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on the number of dimensions. In 1978, work by <a href="Werner%20Nahm">Werner Nahm</a> showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven. In the same year, <a href="Eugene%20Cremmer">Eugene Cremmer</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Julia">Bernard Julia</a>, and <a href="Joel%20Scherk">Joel Scherk</a> of the <a href="%C3%89cole%20Normale%20Sup%C3%A9rieure">École Normale Supérieure</a> showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.

Initially, many physicists hoped that by compactifying eleven-dimensional supergravity, it might be possible to construct realistic models of our four-dimensional world. The hope was that such models would provide a unified description of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the <a href="strong%20nuclear%20force">strong</a> and <a href="weak%20nuclear%20force">weak nuclear force</a>s, and gravity. Interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity soon waned as various flaws in this scheme were discovered. One of the problems was that the laws of physics appear to distinguish between clockwise and counterclockwise, a phenomenon known as <a href="chirality%20%28physics%29">chirality</a>. <a href="Edward%20Witten">Edward Witten</a> and others observed this chirality property cannot be readily derived by compactifying from eleven dimensions.

In the <a href="first%20superstring%20revolution">first superstring revolution</a> in 1984, many physicists turned to string theory as a unified theory of particle physics and quantum gravity. Unlike supergravity theory, string theory was able to accommodate the chirality of the standard model, and it provided a theory of gravity consistent with quantum effects. Another feature of string theory that many physicists were drawn to in the 1980s and 1990s was its high degree of uniqueness. In ordinary particle theories, one can consider any collection of elementary particles whose classical behavior is described by an arbitrary <a href="Lagrangian%20%28field%20theory%29">Lagrangian</a>. In string theory, the possibilities are much more constrained: by the 1990s, physicists had argued that there were only five consistent supersymmetric versions of the theory.

Although there were only a handful of consistent superstring theories, it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation. However, as physicists began to examine string theory more closely, they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways.

In the late 1970s, Claus Montonen and <a href="David%20Olive">David Olive</a> had conjectured a special property of certain physical theories. A sharpened version of their conjecture concerns a theory called <a href="N%20%3D%204%20supersymmetric%20Yang%E2%80%93Mills%20theory">supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory</a>, which describes theoretical particles formally similar to the <a href="quark">quark</a>s and <a href="gluon">gluon</a>s that make up <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nuclei</a>. The strength with which the particles of this theory interact is measured by a number called the <a href="coupling%20constant">coupling constant</a>. The result of Montonen and Olive, now known as <a href="Montonen%E2%80%93Olive%20duality">Montonen–Olive duality</a>, states that supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory with coupling constant is equivalent to the same theory with coupling constant . In other words, a system of strongly interacting particles (large coupling constant) has an equivalent description as a system of weakly interacting particles (small coupling constant) and vice versa by spin-moment.

In the 1990s, several theorists generalized Montonen–Olive duality to the S-duality relationship, which connects different string theories. Ashoke Sen studied S-duality in the context of heterotic strings in four dimensions. <a href="Chris%20Hull">Chris Hull</a> and <a href="Paul%20Townsend">Paul Townsend</a> showed that type IIB string theory with a large coupling constant is equivalent via S-duality to the same theory with small coupling constant. Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T-duality. This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.

String theory extends ordinary particle physics by replacing zero-dimensional point particles by one-dimensional objects called strings. In the late 1980s, it was natural for theorists to attempt to formulate other extensions in which particles are replaced by two-dimensional <a href="supermembranes">supermembranes</a> or by higher-dimensional objects called branes. Such objects had been considered as early as 1962 by <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>, and they were reconsidered by a small but enthusiastic group of physicists in the 1980s.

Supersymmetry severely restricts the possible number of dimensions of a brane. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes. Intuitively, these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime. Shortly after this discovery, <a href="Michael%20Duff%20%28physicist%29">Michael Duff</a>, Paul Howe, Takeo Inami, and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity with one of the dimensions curled up into a circle. In this setting, one can imagine the membrane wrapping around the circular dimension. If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small, then this membrane looks just like a string in ten-dimensional spacetime. In fact, Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory.

In 1990, <a href="Andrew%20Strominger">Andrew Strominger</a> published a similar result which suggested that strongly interacting strings in ten dimensions might have an equivalent description in terms of weakly interacting five-dimensional branes. Initially, physicists were unable to prove this relationship for two important reasons. On the one hand, the Montonen–Olive duality was still unproven, and so Strominger's conjecture was even more tenuous. On the other hand, there were many technical issues related to the quantum properties of five-dimensional branes. The first of these problems was solved in 1993 when <a href="Ashoke%20Sen">Ashoke Sen</a> established that certain physical theories require the existence of objects with both <a href="electric%20charge">electric</a> and <a href="magnetic%20monopole">magnetic</a> charge which were predicted by the work of Montonen and Olive.

In spite of this progress, the relationship between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, a team of researchers including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.

Speaking at the string theory conference at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> in 1995, Edward Witten of the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> made the surprising suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality and the appearance of two- and five-dimensional branes in string theory. In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in an important way. Today this flurry of work is known as the <a href="second%20superstring%20revolution">second superstring revolution</a>.

One of the important developments following Witten's announcement was Witten's work in 1996 with string theorist <a href="Petr%20Ho%C5%99ava%20%28theorist%29">Petr Hořava</a>. Witten and Hořava studied M-theory on a special spacetime geometry with two ten-dimensional boundary components. Their work shed light on the mathematical structure of M-theory and suggested possible ways of connecting M-theory to real world physics.

Initially, some physicists suggested that the new theory was a fundamental theory of membranes, but Witten was skeptical of the role of membranes in the theory. In a paper from 1996, Hořava and Witten wrote

In the absence of an understanding of the true meaning and structure of M-theory, Witten has suggested that the "M" should stand for "magic", "mystery", or "membrane" according to taste, and the true meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known.

In mathematics, a <a href="matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrix</a> is a rectangular array of numbers or other data. In physics, a <a href="matrix%20theory%20%28physics%29">matrix model</a> is a particular kind of physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves the notion of a matrix in an important way. A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics.

One important example of a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by <a href="Tom%20Banks%20%28physicist%29">Tom Banks</a>, <a href="Willy%20Fischler">Willy Fischler</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Shenker">Stephen Shenker</a>, and <a href="Leonard%20Susskind">Leonard Susskind</a> in 1997. This theory describes the behavior of a set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting.

In geometry, it is often useful to introduce <a href="coordinate%20system">coordinates</a>. For example, in order to study the geometry of the <a href="Euclidean%20plane">Euclidean plane</a>, one defines the coordinates and as the distances between any point in the plane and a pair of <a href="axis%20%28mathematics%29">axes</a>. In ordinary geometry, the coordinates of a point are numbers, so they can be multiplied, and the product of two coordinates does not depend on the order of multiplication. That is, . This property of multiplication is known as the <a href="commutative%20law">commutative law</a>, and this relationship between geometry and the <a href="commutative%20algebra">commutative algebra</a> of coordinates is the starting point for much of modern geometry.

<a href="Noncommutative%20geometry">Noncommutative geometry</a> is a branch of mathematics that attempts to generalize this situation. Rather than working with ordinary numbers, one considers some similar objects, such as matrices, whose multiplication does not satisfy the commutative law (that is, objects for which is not necessarily equal to ). One imagines that these noncommuting objects are coordinates on some more general notion of "space" and proves theorems about these generalized spaces by exploiting the analogy with ordinary geometry.

In a paper from 1998, <a href="Alain%20Connes">Alain Connes</a>, <a href="Michael%20R.%20Douglas">Michael R. Douglas</a>, and <a href="Albert%20Schwarz">Albert Schwarz</a> showed that some aspects of matrix models and M-theory are described by a <a href="noncommutative%20quantum%20field%20theory">noncommutative quantum field theory</a>, a special kind of physical theory in which the coordinates on spacetime do not satisfy the commutativity property. This established a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories.

The application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as the electromagnetic field, which are extended in space and time, is known as <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a>. In particle physics, quantum field theories form the basis for our understanding of elementary particles, which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental fields. Quantum field theories are also used throughout condensed matter physics to model particle-like objects called <a href="quasiparticle">quasiparticle</a>s.

One approach to formulating M-theory and studying its properties is provided by the <a href="AdS/CFT%20correspondence">anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence</a>. Proposed by <a href="Juan%20Maldacena">Juan Maldacena</a> in late 1997, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a theoretical result which implies that M-theory is in some cases equivalent to a quantum field theory. In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure of string and M-theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective.

In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the geometry of spacetime is described in terms of a certain <a href="vacuum%20solution">vacuum solution</a> of <a href="Einstein%27s%20equation">Einstein's equation</a> called <a href="anti-de%20Sitter%20space">anti-de Sitter space</a>. In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the <a href="metric%20tensor">metric</a>) is different from the notion of distance in ordinary <a href="Euclidean%20geometry">Euclidean geometry</a>. It is closely related to <a href="hyperbolic%20space">hyperbolic space</a>, which can be viewed as a <a href="Poincar%C3%A9%20disk%20model">disk</a> as illustrated on the left. This image shows a <a href="tessellation">tessellation</a> of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.

Now imagine a stack of hyperbolic disks where each disk represents the state of the <a href="universe">universe</a> at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. It looks like a solid <a href="cylinder%20%28geometry%29">cylinder</a> in which any <a href="cross%20section%20%28geometry%29">cross section</a> is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder plays an important role in the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is <a href="curvature">curved</a> in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.

This construction describes a hypothetical universe with only two space dimensions and one time dimension, but it can be generalized to any number of dimensions. Indeed, hyperbolic space can have more than two dimensions and one can "stack up" copies of hyperbolic space to get higher-dimensional models of anti-de Sitter space.

An important feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder in the case of three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, within a small region on the surface around any given point, it looks just like <a href="Minkowski%20space">Minkowski space</a>, the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics. One can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which "spacetime" is given by the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. This observation is the starting point for AdS/CFT correspondence, which states that the boundary of anti-de Sitter space can be regarded as the "spacetime" for a quantum field theory. The claim is that this quantum field theory is equivalent to the gravitational theory on the bulk anti-de Sitter space in the sense that there is a "dictionary" for translating entities and calculations in one theory into their counterparts in the other theory. For example, a single particle in the gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in the boundary theory. In addition, the predictions in the two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in the gravitational theory, then the corresponding collections in the boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding.

One particular realization of the AdS/CFT correspondence states that M-theory on the <a href="product%20space">product space</a> is equivalent to the so-called <a href="6D%20%282%2C0%29%20superconformal%20field%20theory">(2,0)-theory</a> on the six-dimensional boundary. Here "(2,0)" refers to the particular type of supersymmetry that appears in the theory. In this example, the spacetime of the gravitational theory is effectively seven-dimensional (hence the notation ), and there are four additional "<a href="compact%20space">compact</a>" dimensions (encoded by the <a href="n-sphere"></a> factor). In the real world, spacetime is four-dimensional, at least macroscopically, so this version of the correspondence does not provide a realistic model of gravity. Likewise, the dual theory is not a viable model of any real-world system since it describes a world with six spacetime dimensions.

Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory has proven to be important for studying the general properties of quantum field theories. Indeed, this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting <a href="effective%20field%20theory">effective quantum field theories</a> and points to new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a <a href="Surface%20%28topology%29">surface</a>, one obtains a four-dimensional quantum field theory, and there is a duality known as the <a href="AGT%20correspondence">AGT correspondence</a> which relates the physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, theorists have extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions.

In addition to its applications in quantum field theory, the (2,0)-theory has spawned important results in <a href="pure%20mathematics">pure mathematics</a>. For example, the existence of the (2,0)-theory was used by Witten to give a "physical" explanation for a conjectural relationship in mathematics called the <a href="geometric%20Langlands%20correspondence">geometric Langlands correspondence</a>. In subsequent work, Witten showed that the (2,0)-theory could be used to understand a concept in mathematics called <a href="Khovanov%20homology">Khovanov homology</a>. Developed by <a href="Mikhail%20Khovanov">Mikhail Khovanov</a> around 2000, Khovanov homology provides a tool in <a href="knot%20theory">knot theory</a>, the branch of mathematics that studies and classifies the different shapes of knots. Another application of the (2,0)-theory in mathematics is the work of Davide Gaiotto, <a href="Greg%20Moore%20%28physicist%29">Greg Moore</a>, and Andrew Neitzke, which used physical ideas to derive new results in <a href="hyperk%C3%A4hler%20manifold">hyperkähler geometry</a>.

Another realization of the AdS/CFT correspondence states that M-theory on is equivalent to a quantum field theory called the <a href="ABJM%20superconformal%20field%20theory">ABJM theory</a> in three dimensions. In this version of the correspondence, seven of the dimensions of M-theory are curled up, leaving four non-compact dimensions. Since the spacetime of our universe is four-dimensional, this version of the correspondence provides a somewhat more realistic description of gravity.

The ABJM theory appearing in this version of the correspondence is also interesting for a variety of reasons. Introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena, it is closely related to another quantum field theory called <a href="Chern%E2%80%93Simons%20theory">Chern–Simons theory</a>. The latter theory was popularized by Witten in the late 1980s because of its applications to knot theory. In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics.

In addition to being an idea of considerable theoretical interest, M-theory provides a framework for constructing models of real world physics that combine general relativity with the <a href="standard%20model%20of%20particle%20physics">standard model of particle physics</a>. <a href="Phenomenology%20%28particle%20physics%29">Phenomenology</a> is the branch of theoretical physics in which physicists construct realistic models of nature from more abstract theoretical ideas. <a href="String%20phenomenology">String phenomenology</a> is the part of string theory that attempts to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string and M-theory.

Typically, such models are based on the idea of compactification. Starting with the ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime of string or M-theory, physicists postulate a shape for the extra dimensions. By choosing this shape appropriately, they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics, together with additional undiscovered particles, usually <a href="supersymmetry">supersymmetric</a> partners to analogues of known particles. One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with the heterotic theory in ten dimensions and assume that the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six-dimensional <a href="Calabi%E2%80%93Yau%20manifold">Calabi–Yau manifold</a>. This is a special kind of geometric object named after mathematicians <a href="Eugenio%20Calabi">Eugenio Calabi</a> and <a href="Shing-Tung%20Yau">Shing-Tung Yau</a>. Calabi–Yau manifolds offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory. Other similar methods can be used to construct models with physics resembling to some extent that of our four-dimensional world based on M-theory.

Partly because of theoretical and mathematical difficulties and partly because of the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically possible for the foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature. This has led some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.

In one approach to M-theory phenomenology, theorists assume that the seven extra dimensions of M-theory are shaped like a <a href="G2%20manifold">manifold</a>. This is a special kind of seven-dimensional shape constructed by mathematician <a href="Dominic%20Joyce">Dominic Joyce</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>. These manifolds are still poorly understood mathematically, and this fact has made it difficult for physicists to fully develop this approach to phenomenology.

For example, physicists and mathematicians often assume that space has a mathematical property called <a href="smooth%20manifold">smoothness</a>, but this property cannot be assumed in the case of a manifold if one wishes to recover the physics of our four-dimensional world. Another problem is that manifolds are not <a href="complex%20manifold">complex manifold</a>s, so theorists are unable to use tools from the branch of mathematics known as <a href="complex%20analysis">complex analysis</a>. Finally, there are many open questions about the existence, uniqueness, and other mathematical properties of manifolds, and mathematicians lack a systematic way of searching for these manifolds.

Because of the difficulties with manifolds, most attempts to construct realistic theories of physics based on M-theory have taken a more indirect approach to compactifying eleven-dimensional spacetime. One approach, pioneered by Witten, Hořava, <a href="Burt%20Ovrut">Burt Ovrut</a>, and others, is known as heterotic M-theory. In this approach, one imagines that one of the eleven dimensions of M-theory is shaped like a circle. If this circle is very small, then the spacetime becomes effectively ten-dimensional. One then assumes that six of the ten dimensions form a Calabi–Yau manifold. If this Calabi–Yau manifold is also taken to be small, one is left with a theory in four-dimensions.

Heterotic M-theory has been used to construct models of <a href="brane%20cosmology">brane cosmology</a> in which the observable universe is thought to exist on a brane in a higher dimensional ambient space. It has also spawned alternative theories of the early universe that do not rely on the theory of <a href="cosmic%20inflation">cosmic inflation</a>.

Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the beginning of the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20NBA%20season">1993–94 NBA season</a>, and started a new career in <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">Minor League Baseball</a>, he returned to the Bulls in <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NBA%20season">March 1995</a> and led them to three additional championships in <a href="1996%20NBA%20Finals">1996</a>, <a href="1997%20NBA%20Finals">1997</a>, and <a href="1998%20NBA%20Finals">1998</a>, as well as a then-record <a href="List%20of%20NBA%20teams%20by%20single%20season%20win%20percentage">72 regular-season wins</a> in the 1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NBA%20season">January 1999</a>, but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Wizards.

Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six <a href="Bill%20Russell%20NBA%20Finals%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards</a>, ten <a href="List%20of%20National%20Basketball%20Association%20annual%20scoring%20leaders">scoring titles</a> (both all-time records), five <a href="NBA%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">MVP Awards</a>, ten <a href="All-NBA%20Team">All-NBA</a> First Team designations, nine <a href="NBA%20All-Defensive%20Team">All-Defensive</a> First Team honors, fourteen <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Game">NBA All-Star Game</a> selections, three <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Game%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">All-Star Game MVP Awards</a>, three <a href="steal%20%28basketball%29">steals</a> titles, and the 1988 <a href="NBA%20Defensive%20Player%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award</a>. He holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, and was second to <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> on the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>' list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into the <a href="Naismith%20Memorial%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame</a>, having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the <a href="1992%20United%20States%20men%27s%20Olympic%20basketball%20team">1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team</a> ("The Dream Team"). He became a member of the <a href="FIBA%20Hall%20of%20Fame">FIBA Hall of Fame</a> in 2015.

Jordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike's</a> <a href="Air%20Jordan">Air Jordan</a> sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today. Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 film "<a href="Space%20Jam">Space Jam</a>". In 2006, he became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets), and bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2014, Jordan became the first <a href="billionaire">billionaire</a> player in NBA history. He is the third-richest African-American, behind <a href="Robert%20F.%20Smith%20%28investor%29">Robert F. Smith</a> and <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>.

Jordan was born in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, to Deloris (née Peoples), who worked in banking, and <a href="James%20R.%20Jordan%20Sr.">James R. Jordan Sr.</a>, an equipment supervisor. His family moved to <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>, when he was a toddler.

Jordan is the fourth of five children. He has two older brothers, Larry Jordan and James R. Jordan, Jr., one older sister, Deloris, and one younger sister, Roslyn. Jordan's brother James retired in 2006 as the <a href="Sergeant%20major">Command Sergeant Major</a> of the <a href="35th%20Signal%20Brigade%20%28United%20States%29">35th Signal Brigade</a> of the <a href="XVIII%20Airborne%20Corps">XVIII Airborne Corps</a> in the U.S. Army.

Jordan attended <a href="Emsley%20A.%20Laney%20High%20School">Emsley A. Laney High School</a> in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the <a href="varsity%20team">varsity</a> basketball team during his <a href="Tenth%20grade">sophomore year</a>, but at 5'11" (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend, <a href="Harvest%20Smith">Harvest Leroy Smith</a>, was the only sophomore to make the team.

Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's <a href="junior%20varsity%20team">junior varsity team</a>, and tallied several 40-point games. The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged more than 25 <a href="points%20per%20game">points per game</a> (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play. As a <a href="Twelfth%20grade">senior</a>, he was selected to play in the <a href="1981%20McDonald%27s%20All-American%20Boys%20Game">1981 McDonald's All-American Game</a> and scored 30 points, after averaging 27 points, 12 <a href="rebound%20%28basketball%29">rebounds</a> and 6 <a href="assist%20%28basketball%29">assists</a> per game for the season.

Jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including <a href="Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20men%27s%20basketball">Duke</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20men%27s%20basketball">North Carolina</a>, <a href="South%20Carolina%20Gamecocks%20men%27s%20basketball">South Carolina</a>, <a href="Syracuse%20Orange%20men%27s%20basketball">Syracuse</a>, and <a href="Virginia%20Cavaliers%20men%27s%20basketball">Virginia</a>. In 1981, Jordan accepted a basketball scholarship to North Carolina, where he <a href="Major%20%28academic%29">majored</a> in <a href="cultural%20geography">cultural geography</a>.

As a freshman in coach <a href="Dean%20Smith">Dean Smith</a>'s team-oriented system, he was named <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">ACC</a> Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (<a href="field%20goal%20percentage">field goal percentage</a>). He made the game-winning jump shot in the <a href="1982%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Championship%20Game">1982 NCAA Championship game</a> against <a href="Georgetown%20Hoyas%20men%27s%20basketball">Georgetown</a>, which was led by future NBA rival <a href="Patrick%20Ewing">Patrick Ewing</a>. Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. During his three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 rpg. He was selected by consensus to the <a href="1983%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20All-Americans">NCAA All-American First Team</a> in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the <a href="Naismith%20College%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Naismith</a> and the <a href="John%20R.%20Wooden%20Award">Wooden</a> College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the <a href="1984%20NBA%20draft">1984 NBA draft</a>. The <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Chicago%20Bulls%20season">Chicago Bulls</a> selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after <a href="Hakeem%20Olajuwon">Hakeem Olajuwon</a> (<a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Houston%20Rockets%20season">Houston Rockets</a>) and <a href="Sam%20Bowie">Sam Bowie</a> (<a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Portland%20Trail%20Blazers%20season">Portland Trail Blazers</a>). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a <a href="center%20%28basketball%29">center</a>. However, Trail Blazers general manager <a href="Stu%20Inman">Stu Inman</a> contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center, but more a matter of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had <a href="Clyde%20Drexler">Clyde Drexler</a>, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan. <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986. He graduated the same year with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in geography.

During <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20NBA%20season">his rookie season</a> with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting, and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas, Roy S. Johnson of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described him as "the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls" in November, and Jordan appeared on the cover of "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" with the heading "A Star Is Born" in December. The fans also voted in Jordan as an <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> starter during his rookie season. Controversy arose before the All-Star game when word surfaced that several veteran players—led by <a href="Isiah%20Thomas">Isiah Thomas</a>—were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving. This led to a so-called "freeze-out" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him throughout the game. The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted Rookie of the Year. The Bulls finished the season 38–44 and lost to the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Milwaukee%20Bucks%20season">Milwaukee Bucks</a> in four games in the <a href="1985%20NBA%20Playoffs">first round of the playoffs</a>.

Jordan's <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20NBA%20season">second season</a> was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games. Despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record (at the time it was fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history), the Bulls made the <a href="1986%20NBA%20Playoffs">playoffs</a>. Jordan recovered in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Boston%20Celtics%20season">1985–86 Boston Celtics team</a> that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history, Jordan set the still-unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in Game 2. The Celtics, however, managed to sweep the series.

Jordan had completely recovered in time for the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20NBA%20season">1986–87 season</a>, and he had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history. He became the only player other than <a href="Wilt%20Chamberlain">Wilt Chamberlain</a> to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting. In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 <a href="block%20%28basketball%29">blocked shots</a> in a season. Despite Jordan's success, <a href="Magic%20Johnson">Magic Johnson</a> won the league's <a href="NBA%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Most Valuable Player Award</a>. The Bulls reached 40 wins, and advanced to <a href="1987%20NBA%20Playoffs">the playoffs</a> for the third consecutive year. However, they were again swept by the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Boston%20Celtics%20season">Celtics</a>.

Jordan again led the league in scoring during the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20NBA%20season">1987–88 season</a>, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting and won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the <a href="NBA%20Defensive%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Defensive Player of the Year</a>, as he had averaged 1.6 blocks and a league high 3.16 steals per game. The Bulls finished 50–32, and made it out of the first round of <a href="1988%20NBA%20Playoffs">the playoffs</a> for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Cleveland%20Cavaliers%20season">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> in five games. However, the Bulls then lost in five games to the more experienced <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20Detroit%20Pistons%20season">Detroit Pistons</a>, who were led by <a href="Isiah%20Thomas">Isiah Thomas</a> and a group of physical players known as the "".

In the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20NBA%20season">1988–89 season</a>, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 apg. The Bulls finished with a 47–35 record, and advanced to the <a href="Eastern%20Conference%20%28NBA%29">Eastern Conference</a> Finals, defeating the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Cleveland%20Cavaliers%20season">Cavaliers</a> and <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20New%20York%20Knicks%20season">New York Knicks</a> along the way. The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit "<a href="The%20Shot">The Shot</a>" over <a href="Craig%20Ehlo">Craig Ehlo</a> at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series. However, the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Detroit%20Pistons%20season">Pistons</a> again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games, by utilizing their "<a href="Jordan%20Rules">Jordan Rules</a>" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of <a href="double%20team">double and triple teaming</a> him every time he touched the ball.

The Bulls entered the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20NBA%20season">1989–90 season</a> as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like <a href="Scottie%20Pippen">Scottie Pippen</a> and <a href="Horace%20Grant">Horace Grant</a>, and under the guidance of new coach <a href="Phil%20Jackson">Phil Jackson</a>. Jordan averaged a league leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record. They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Milwaukee%20Bucks%20season">Bucks</a> and <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Philadelphia%2076ers%20season">Philadelphia 76ers</a>. However, despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Detroit%20Pistons%20season">Pistons</a> for the third consecutive season.

In the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NBA%20season">1990–91 season</a>, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season. The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in 16 years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season. With <a href="Scottie%20Pippen">Scottie Pippen</a> developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20New%20York%20Knicks%20season">New York Knicks</a> and the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Philadelphia%2076ers%20season">Philadelphia 76ers</a> in the opening two rounds of <a href="1991%20NBA%20Playoffs">the playoffs</a>. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Detroit%20Pistons%20season">Detroit Pistons</a>, awaited them. However, this time the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.

The Bulls advanced to <a href="1991%20NBA%20Finals">the NBA Finals</a> for the first time in franchise history to face the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Los%20Angeles%20Lakers%20season">Los Angeles Lakers</a>, who had <a href="Magic%20Johnson">Magic Johnson</a> and <a href="James%20Worthy">James Worthy</a>, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled a 15–2 playoff record along the way. Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential <a href="Sam%20Perkins">Sam Perkins</a> block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. In his first Finals appearance, Jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. Jordan won his first <a href="Bill%20Russell%20NBA%20Finals%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">NBA Finals MVP</a> award, and he cried while holding the NBA Finals trophy.

Jordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20NBA%20season">1991–92 season</a>, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from 1990–91. Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game on 52% shooting. After winning a physical 7-game series over the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20New%20York%20Knicks%20season">New York Knicks</a> in the second round of <a href="1992%20NBA%20Playoffs">the playoffs</a> and finishing off the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Cleveland%20Cavaliers%20season">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> in the Conference Finals in 6 games, the Bulls met <a href="Clyde%20Drexler">Clyde Drexler</a> and the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Portland%20Trail%20Blazers%20season">Portland Trail Blazers</a> in <a href="1992%20NBA%20Finals">the Finals</a>. The media, hoping to recreate a <a href="Celtics%E2%80%93Lakers%20rivalry">Magic–Bird rivalry</a>, highlighted the similarities between "Air" Jordan and Clyde "The Glide" during the pre-Finals hype. In the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six <a href="three-point%20field%20goal">three-point field goal</a>s. After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. <a href="Marv%20Albert">Marv Albert</a>, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying, "I can't believe I'm doing this." The Bulls went on to win Game 1, and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 53% from the floor.

In the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20NBA%20season">1992–93 season</a>, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign and a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting, Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended as he lost the award to his friend <a href="Charles%20Barkley">Charles Barkley</a>. Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Phoenix%20Suns%20season">Phoenix Suns</a> in the <a href="1993%20NBA%20Finals">1993 NBA Finals</a>. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by <a href="John%20Paxson">John Paxson</a> and a last-second block by <a href="Horace%20Grant">Horace Grant</a>, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series, and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards. He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in 4 consecutive games. With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.

During the Bulls' <a href="1993%20NBA%20Playoffs">playoff run in 1993</a>, Jordan was seen gambling in <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>, the night before a game against the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20New%20York%20Knicks%20season">New York Knicks</a>. In that same year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course. <a href="NBA%20Commissioner">NBA Commissioner</a> <a href="David%20Stern">David Stern</a> denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling, but the rumor spread widely. In 2005, Jordan talked to <a href="Ed%20Bradley">Ed Bradley</a> of the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> evening show "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" about his gambling and admitted that he made some reckless decisions. Jordan stated, "Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah." When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied, "No." In 2010 <a href="Ron%20Shelton">Ron Shelton</a>, director of "<a href="Jordan%20Rides%20the%20Bus">Jordan Rides the Bus</a>", said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research "convinced [him it] was nonsense".

On October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, citing a loss of desire to play the game. Jordan later stated that the death of his father three months earlier also shaped his decision. Jordan's father was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in <a href="Lumberton%2C%20North%20Carolina">Lumberton, North Carolina</a>, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his luxury <a href="Lexus">Lexus</a> bearing the license plate "UNC 0023". His body was dumped in a South Carolina swamp and was not discovered until August 3. The assailants were traced from calls that they made on James Jordan's cell phone. The two criminals were caught, convicted at trial, and sentenced to life in prison. Jordan was close to his father; as a child he had imitated his father's proclivity to stick out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, displaying it each time he drove to the basket. In 1996, he founded a Chicago area <a href="Boys%20%26amp%3B%20Girls%20Clubs%20of%20America">Boys & Girls Club</a> and dedicated it to his father.

In his 1998 autobiography "For the Love of the Game", Jordan wrote that he had been preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992. The added exhaustion due to the <a href="1992%20United%20States%20men%27s%20Olympic%20basketball%20team">Dream Team</a> run in the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992 Olympics</a> solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.

Jordan then further surprised the sports world by signing a <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">Minor League Baseball</a> contract with the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> on February 7, 1994. He reported to <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> in <a href="Sarasota%2C%20Florida">Sarasota, Florida</a>, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31, 1994. Jordan has stated this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who had always envisioned his son as a <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> player. The White Sox were another team owned by Bulls owner <a href="Jerry%20Reinsdorf">Jerry Reinsdorf</a>, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.

In 1994, Jordan played for the <a href="Birmingham%20Barons">Birmingham Barons</a>, a <a href="Double-A%20%28baseball%29">Double-A</a> minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, <a href="batting%20average">batting</a> .202 with three <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s, 51 <a href="runs%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a>, 30 <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a>s, 114 <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a>s, 51 <a href="base%20on%20balls">base on balls</a>, and 11 <a href="error%20%28baseball%29">errors</a>. He also appeared for the <a href="Scottsdale%20Scorpions">Scottsdale Scorpions</a> in the 1994 <a href="Arizona%20Fall%20League">Arizona Fall League</a>, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball. On November 1, 1994, his number 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as "<a href="Michael%20Jordan%20statue">The Spirit</a>" outside the new <a href="United%20Center">United Center</a>.

In the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20NBA%20season">1993–94 season</a>, the Bulls achieved a 55–27 record without Jordan in the lineup, and lost to the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20New%20York%20Knicks%20season">New York Knicks</a> in the second round of <a href="1994%20NBA%20Playoffs">the playoffs</a>. The <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Chicago%20Bulls%20season">1994–95 Bulls</a> were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one point in mid-March. The team received help, however, when Jordan decided to return to the Bulls.

In March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball due to the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">ongoing Major League Baseball strike</a>, as he wanted to avoid becoming a potential <a href="replacement%20player">replacement player</a>. On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA through a two-word press release: "I'm back." The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Indiana%20Pacers%20season">Indiana Pacers</a> in <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, scoring 19 points. The game had the highest <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of a regular season NBA game since 1975. Although he could have opted to wear his normal number in spite of the Bulls having retired it, Jordan instead wore number 45, as he had while playing baseball.

Although he had not played an NBA game in a year and a half, Jordan played well upon his return, making a game-winning jump shot against <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Atlanta%20Hawks%20season">Atlanta</a> in his fourth game back. He then scored 55 points in the next game against the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20New%20York%20Knicks%20season">Knicks</a> at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> on March 28, 1995. Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 <a href="1995%20NBA%20Playoffs">to make the playoffs</a> and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Orlando%20Magic%20season">Orlando Magic</a>. At the end of Game 1, Orlando's <a href="Nick%20Anderson">Nick Anderson</a> stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he would later comment that Jordan "didn't look like the old Michael Jordan" and that "No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to."

Jordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former number, 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA. Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black. He averaged 31 points per game in the series, but Orlando won the series in six games.

Jordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20NBA%20season">1995–96 season</a>. The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist <a href="Dennis%20Rodman">Dennis Rodman</a>, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3. The Bulls eventually finished with the <a href="List%20of%20NBA%20teams%20by%20single%20season%20win%20percentage">then-best regular season record</a> in NBA history, 72–10; this record was later surpassed by the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Golden%20State%20Warriors%20season">2015–16 Golden State Warriors</a>. Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg and won the league's regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.

In <a href="1996%20NBA%20Playoffs">the playoffs</a>, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (<a href="Miami%20Heat">Miami Heat</a> 3–0, <a href="New%20York%20Knicks">New York Knicks</a> 4–1, <a href="Orlando%20Magic">Orlando Magic</a> 4–0). They defeated the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Seattle%20SuperSonics%20season">Seattle SuperSonics</a> 4–2 in the <a href="1996%20NBA%20Finals">NBA Finals</a> to win their fourth championship. Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing <a href="Magic%20Johnson">Magic Johnson</a>'s three Finals MVP awards. He also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP Awards in the All-Star Game, regular season and NBA Finals, <a href="Willis%20Reed">Willis Reed</a> having achieved the first, during the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20NBA%20season">1969–70 season</a>. Because this was Jordan's first championship since his father's murder, and it was won on <a href="Father%27s%20Day">Father's Day</a>, Jordan reacted very emotionally upon winning the title, including a memorable scene of him crying on the locker room floor with the game ball.

In the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NBA%20season">1996–97 season</a>, the Bulls started out 69–11, but missed out on a second consecutive 70-win season by losing their final two games to finish 69–13. However, this year Jordan was beaten for the NBA MVP Award by <a href="Karl%20Malone">Karl Malone</a>. The Bulls again advanced to <a href="1997%20NBA%20Finals">the Finals</a>, where they faced Malone and the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Utah%20Jazz%20season">Utah Jazz</a>. The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan's career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a <a href="buzzer%20beater">buzzer-beating</a> jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as the "<a href="Flu%20game">Flu Game</a>", Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-deciding 3-pointer with 25 seconds remaining. The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six games. For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the <a href="Bill%20Russell%20NBA%20Finals%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Finals MVP award</a>. During the <a href="1997%20NBA%20All-Star%20Game">1997 NBA All-Star Game</a>, Jordan posted the first <a href="triple%20double">triple double</a> in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort; however, he did not receive the MVP award.

Jordan and the Bulls compiled a 62–20 record in the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NBA%20season">1997–98 season</a>. Jordan led the league with 28.7 points per game, securing his fifth regular-season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team and the All-Star Game MVP. The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Indiana%20Pacers%20season">Indiana Pacers</a> in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20New%20York%20Knicks%20season">Knicks</a>. After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Utah%20Jazz%20season">Jazz</a> in <a href="1998%20NBA%20Finals">the Finals</a>.

The Bulls returned to the <a href="Delta%20Center">Delta Center</a> for <a href="Game%206%20of%20the%201998%20NBA%20Finals">Game 6</a> on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history. With the Bulls trailing 86–83 with 41.9 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and hit a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting the Utah lead to 86–85. The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to forward Karl Malone, who was set up in the <a href="low%20post">low post</a> and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and took the ball out of his hands for a steal. Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard <a href="Bryon%20Russell">Bryon Russell</a>. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a <a href="Personal%20foul%20%28basketball%29">foul</a>. With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan gave Chicago an 87–86 lead with a game-winning jumper, the climactic shot of his Bulls career. Afterwards, John Stockton missed a game-winning three-pointer. Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship and second three-peat. Once again, Jordan was voted the Finals MVP, having led all scorers averaging 33.5 points per game, including 45 in the deciding Game 6. Jordan's six Finals MVPs is a record; <a href="Shaquille%20O%27Neal">Shaquille O'Neal</a>, <a href="Magic%20Johnson">Magic Johnson</a>, <a href="LeBron%20James">LeBron James</a> and <a href="Tim%20Duncan">Tim Duncan</a> are tied for second place with three apiece. The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history. Game 6 also holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.

With <a href="Phil%20Jackson">Phil Jackson</a>'s contract expiring, the pending departures of <a href="Scottie%20Pippen">Scottie Pippen</a> and <a href="Dennis%20Rodman">Dennis Rodman</a> looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NBA%20lockout">lockout</a> of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999. On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player, but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the <a href="Washington%20Wizards">Washington Wizards</a>. Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive. He controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters. Opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed. He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (such as forward <a href="Juwan%20Howard">Juwan Howard</a> and point guard <a href="Rod%20Strickland">Rod Strickland</a>), but used the first pick in the <a href="2001%20NBA%20draft">2001 NBA draft</a> to select high schooler <a href="Kwame%20Brown">Kwame Brown</a>, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.

Despite his January 1999 claim that he was "99.9% certain" that he would never play another NBA game, in the summer of 2001 Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback, this time with his new team. Inspired by the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">NHL</a> comeback of his friend <a href="Mario%20Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a> the previous winter, Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago. In addition, Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, <a href="Doug%20Collins%20%28basketball%29">Doug Collins</a>, as Washington's coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.

On September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>. In an injury-plagued <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NBA%20season">2001–02 season</a>, he led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.42 spg). However, torn <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> in his right knee ended Jordan's season after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NBA%20season">1994–95 season</a>. Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 points, 5.4 assists, and 6.0 rebounds, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.

Playing in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed <a href="Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history (a record since broken by <a href="Kobe%20Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>). That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them. He averaged 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game. He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free throw line. Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times. On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game. During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the <a href="MCI%20Center">MCI Center</a> were sold out, and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road. However, neither of Jordan's final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and Jordan was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him. At several points he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of the <a href="List%20of%20first%20overall%20NBA%20draft%20picks">number one draft pick</a> in the <a href="2001%20NBA%20draft">2001 NBA draft</a>, <a href="Kwame%20Brown">Kwame Brown</a>.

With the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the <a href="United%20Center">United Center</a> in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation. The <a href="Miami%20Heat">Miami Heat</a> retired the number 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team. At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from <a href="Tracy%20McGrady">Tracy McGrady</a> and <a href="Allen%20Iverson">Allen Iverson</a>, but refused both. In the end, he accepted the spot of <a href="Vince%20Carter">Vince Carter</a>, who decided to give it up under great public pressure.

Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. After scoring only 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and his team trailing the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Philadelphia%2076ers%20season">Philadelphia 76ers</a>, 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the <a href="First%20Union%20Center">First Union Center</a> crowd began chanting "We want Mike!" After much encouragement from coach <a href="Doug%20Collins%20%28basketball%29">Doug Collins</a>, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing <a href="Larry%20Hughes">Larry Hughes</a> with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' <a href="Eric%20Snow">Eric Snow</a>, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie <a href="John%20Salmons">John Salmons</a>, who in turn was intentionally fouled by <a href="Bobby%20Simmons">Bobby Simmons</a> one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.

Jordan played on two Olympic <a href="gold%20medal">gold medal</a>-winning American basketball teams. He won a gold medal as a college player in the <a href="1984%20Summer%20Olympics">1984 Summer Olympics</a>. The <a href="1984%20United%20States%20men%27s%20Olympic%20basketball%20team">team</a> was coached by <a href="Bob%20Knight">Bob Knight</a> and featured players such as <a href="Patrick%20Ewing">Patrick Ewing</a>, <a href="Sam%20Perkins">Sam Perkins</a>, <a href="Chris%20Mullin%20%28basketball%29">Chris Mullin</a>, <a href="Steve%20Alford">Steve Alford</a>, and <a href="Wayman%20Tisdale">Wayman Tisdale</a>. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.

In the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992 Summer Olympics</a>, he was a member of the star-studded squad that included <a href="Magic%20Johnson">Magic Johnson</a>, <a href="Larry%20Bird">Larry Bird</a>, and <a href="David%20Robinson%20%28basketball%29">David Robinson</a> and was dubbed the "<a href="1992%20United%20States%20men%27s%20Olympic%20basketball%20team">Dream Team</a>". Jordan was the only player to start all 8 games in the Olympics. Playing limited minutes due to the frequent <a href="Blowout%20%28sports%29">blowouts</a>, Jordan averaged 14.9 ppg, finishing second on the team in scoring. Jordan and fellow Dream Team members <a href="Patrick%20Ewing">Patrick Ewing</a> and <a href="Chris%20Mullin%20%28basketball%29">Chris Mullin</a> are the only American men's basketball players to win Olympic gold medals as amateurs and professionals.

After his third retirement, Jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office position as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards. However, his previous tenure in the Wizards' front office had produced the aforementioned mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of <a href="Richard%20Hamilton%20%28basketball%29">Richard "Rip" Hamilton</a> for <a href="Jerry%20Stackhouse">Jerry Stackhouse</a> (although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002). On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner <a href="Abe%20Pollin">Abe Pollin</a> fired Jordan as the team's president of basketball operations. Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he would be fired upon retiring he never would have come back to play for the Wizards.

Jordan kept busy over the next few years. He stayed in shape, played golf in celebrity charity tournaments, and spent time with his family in Chicago. He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles. Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two <a href="Suzuki">Suzuki</a>s in the <a href="AMA%20Superbike%20Championship">premier Superbike championship</a> sanctioned by the <a href="American%20Motorcyclist%20Association">American Motorcyclist Association</a> (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season. In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago's <a href="Hales%20Franciscan%20High%20School">Hales Franciscan High School</a>. The Jordan Brand has made donations to <a href="Habitat%20for%20Humanity">Habitat for Humanity</a> and a <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> branch of the <a href="Boys%20%26amp%3B%20Girls%20Clubs%20of%20America">Boys & Girls Clubs of America</a>.

On June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the <a href="Charlotte%20Bobcats">Charlotte Bobcats</a>, becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner <a href="Robert%20L.%20Johnson">Robert L. Johnson</a>. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title "Managing Member of Basketball Operations." Despite Jordan's previous success as an endorser, he has made an effort not to be included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns. A decade earlier, Jordan had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte's original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner <a href="George%20Shinn">George Shinn</a> refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.

In February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats, who changed their nickname to the Hornets in 2014. As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former <a href="Houston%20Rockets">Houston Rockets</a> president <a href="George%20Postolos">George Postolos</a> were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team pending NBA approval. On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team. It also made him the league's only African-American majority owner of an NBA team.

During the <a href="2011%20NBA%20lockout">2011 NBA lockout</a>, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NBA%20lockout">labor dispute in 1998</a>, Jordan had told <a href="Washington%20Wizards">Washington Wizards</a> then-owner <a href="Abe%20Pollin">Abe Pollin</a>, "If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team." <a href="Jason%20Whitlock">Jason Whitlock</a> of "<a href="FoxSports.com">FoxSports.com</a>" called Jordan a "sellout" wanting "current players to pay for his incompetence." He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players <a href="Kwame%20Brown">Kwame Brown</a> and <a href="Adam%20Morrison">Adam Morrison</a>.

During the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20NBA%20season">2011–12 NBA season</a> that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59 record. Their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history. "I'm not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It's very, very frustrating", Jordan said later that year.

Jordan was a <a href="shooting%20guard">shooting guard</a> who was also capable of playing as a <a href="small%20forward">small forward</a> (the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the <a href="Washington%20Wizards">Washington Wizards</a>), and as a <a href="point%20guard">point guard</a>. Jordan was known throughout his career for being a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests. His competitiveness was visible in his prolific <a href="trash-talk">trash-talk</a> and well-known work ethic. As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not "tough enough" to compete with him in practice. To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvisation at game time. Noted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee. He played all 82 games nine times. Jordan has frequently cited <a href="David%20Thompson%20%28basketball%29">David Thompson</a>, <a href="Walter%20Davis%20%28basketball%29">Walter Davis</a>, and <a href="Jerry%20West">Jerry West</a> as influences. Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special "Love of the Game Clause" written into his contract (unusual at the time) which allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.

Jordan had a versatile offensive game. He was capable of aggressively <a href="Penetration%20%28basketball%29">driving</a> to the basket, as well as drawing <a href="Personal%20foul%20%28basketball%29">fouls</a> from his opponents at a high rate; his 8,772 <a href="free%20throw">free throw</a> attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history. As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to <a href="post%20up">post up</a> his opponents and score with his trademark <a href="fadeaway">fadeaway</a> <a href="jump%20shot%20%28basketball%29">jump shot</a>, using his leaping ability to "fade away" from block attempts. According to <a href="Hubie%20Brown">Hubie Brown</a>, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable. Despite media criticism as a "selfish" player early in his career, Jordan's 5.3 assists per game also indicate his willingness to defer to his teammates. After shooting under 30% from <a href="Three-point%20field%20goal">three-point</a> range in his first five seasons in the NBA, including a career-low 13% in the season, Jordan improved to a career-high 50% in the season. The three-point shot became more of a focus of his game from 1994–95 to 1996–97, when the NBA shortened its three-point line to (from ). His three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which he attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989–90 and 1996–97. For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder (6.2 per game).

In 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award and became the first NBA player to win both the Defensive Player of the Year and MVP awards in a career (since equaled by <a href="Hakeem%20Olajuwon">Hakeem Olajuwon</a>, <a href="David%20Robinson%20%28basketball%29">David Robinson</a>, and <a href="Kevin%20Garnett">Kevin Garnett</a>; Olajuwon is the only player other than Jordan to win both during the same season). In addition, he set both seasonal and career records for <a href="block%20%28basketball%29">blocked shots</a> by a guard, and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. He ranks third in NBA history in total <a href="steal%20%28basketball%29">steals</a> with 2,514, trailing <a href="John%20Stockton">John Stockton</a> and <a href="Jason%20Kidd">Jason Kidd</a>. <a href="Jerry%20West">Jerry West</a> often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones. He was also known to have strong eyesight; broadcaster <a href="Al%20Michaels">Al Michaels</a> said that he was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69 cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15 m) away.

Jordan's talent was clear from his first NBA season; by November he was being compared to <a href="Julius%20Erving">Julius Erving</a>. Larry Bird said that he had "Never seen anyone like him", that Jordan was "One of a kind" and the best player he had ever seen, and comparable to <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> as an athlete. In his first game in <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a standing ovation of almost one minute. After he scored a playoff record 63 points against the <a href="Boston%20Celtics">Boston Celtics</a> on April 20, 1986, Bird described him as "God disguised as Michael Jordan".

Jordan <a href="List%20of%20National%20Basketball%20Association%20annual%20scoring%20leaders">led the NBA in scoring</a> in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied <a href="Wilt%20Chamberlain">Wilt Chamberlain</a>'s record of seven consecutive scoring titles. He was also a fixture on the <a href="NBA%20All-Defensive%20Team">NBA All-Defensive First Team</a>, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with <a href="Gary%20Payton">Gary Payton</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Garnett">Kevin Garnett</a> and <a href="Kobe%20Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>). Jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game, respectively. By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer. In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time. Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the <a href="List%20of%20National%20Basketball%20Association%20career%20playoff%20scoring%20leaders">second-highest in NBA history</a>. He retired with 32,292 points in regular season play, placing him fourth on the <a href="List%20of%20National%20Basketball%20Association%20career%20scoring%20leaders">NBA's all-time scoring list</a> behind <a href="Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>, <a href="Karl%20Malone">Karl Malone</a>, and <a href="Kobe%20Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>.

With five regular-season MVPs (tied for second place with <a href="Bill%20Russell">Bill Russell</a>—only <a href="Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Game%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">All-Star Game MVPs</a>, Jordan is the most decorated player in NBA history. Jordan finished among the top three in regular-season MVP voting 10 times, and was named one of the <a href="50%20Greatest%20Players%20in%20NBA%20History">50 Greatest Players in NBA History</a> in 1996. He is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams). Since 1976, the year of the NBA's <a href="American%20Basketball%20Association%E2%80%93National%20Basketball%20Association%20merger">merger</a> with the <a href="American%20Basketball%20Association">American Basketball Association</a>, Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team. In the <a href="List%20of%20NBA%20All-Star%20vote%20leaders">All-Star Game fan ballot</a>, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.
Many of Jordan's contemporaries have said that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. In 1999, an <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, above such luminaries as <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> and <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>. Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes. In addition, the Associated Press voted him the greatest basketball player of the 20th century. Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" a record 50 times. In the September 1996 issue of "<a href="Sport%20%28US%20magazine%29">Sport</a>", which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.

Jordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back <a href="Slam%20Dunk%20Contest">Slam Dunk Contest</a> championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players. Several current NBA players—including <a href="LeBron%20James">LeBron James</a> and <a href="Dwyane%20Wade">Dwyane Wade</a>—have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while they were growing up. In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players "the next Michael Jordan" upon their entry to the NBA, including <a href="Penny%20Hardaway">Penny Hardaway</a>, <a href="Grant%20Hill%20%28basketball%29">Grant Hill</a>, <a href="Allen%20Iverson">Allen Iverson</a>, <a href="Kobe%20Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>, LeBron James, <a href="Vince%20Carter">Vince Carter</a>, and Dwyane Wade. Although Jordan was a well-rounded player, his "Air Jordan" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players, a fact Jordan himself has lamented. 

During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game. Television ratings increased only during his time in the league. The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title. As late as 2015, Finals ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.
In August 2009, the <a href="Naismith%20Memorial%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame</a> in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield, Massachusetts</a>, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers, as well as from the <a href="1992%20United%20States%20men%27s%20Olympic%20basketball%20team">1992 "Dream Team"</a>. The exhibit also has a <a href="Baseball%20glove">batting glove</a> to signify Jordan's short career in Minor League Baseball. After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member <a href="David%20Thompson%20%28basketball%29">David Thompson</a> to present him. As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, when he was growing up in North Carolina, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels and greatly admired Thompson, who played at rival <a href="NC%20State%20Wolfpack%20men%27s%20basketball">North Carolina State</a>. In September, he was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including <a href="Scottie%20Pippen">Scottie Pippen</a>, <a href="Dennis%20Rodman">Dennis Rodman</a>, <a href="Charles%20Oakley">Charles Oakley</a>, <a href="Ron%20Harper">Ron Harper</a>, <a href="Steve%20Kerr">Steve Kerr</a>, and <a href="Toni%20Kuko%C4%8D">Toni Kukoč</a>. Two of Jordan's former coaches, Dean Smith and Doug Collins, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech—when he began to cry—was captured by <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> photographer <a href="Stephan%20Savoia">Stephan Savoia</a> and would later go viral on social media as the <a href="Crying%20Jordan">Crying Jordan</a> Internet meme. In 2016, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> honored Jordan with the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>.

Jordan married Juanita Vanoy in September 1989, and they had two sons, <a href="Jeffrey%20Jordan">Jeffrey Michael</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Jordan">Marcus James</a>, and a daughter, Jasmine Mickael. Jordan and Vanoy filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made "mutually and amicably". It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $ million in ), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.

In 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in <a href="Highland%20Park%2C%20Illinois">Highland Park, Illinois</a>, to build a 56,000 square-foot (5,200 m) mansion, which was completed four years later. Jordan listed his Highland Park mansion for sale in 2012. His two sons attended <a href="Loyola%20Academy">Loyola Academy</a>, a private <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> high school located in <a href="Wilmette%2C%20Illinois">Wilmette, Illinois</a>. Jeffrey graduated as a member of the 2007 graduating class and played his first collegiate basketball game on November 11, 2007, for the <a href="Illinois%20Fighting%20Illini%20men%27s%20basketball">University of Illinois</a>. After two seasons, Jeffrey left the <a href="Illinois%20Fighting%20Illini%20men%27s%20basketball">Illinois</a> basketball team in 2009. He later rejoined the team for a third season, then received a release to transfer to the <a href="UCF%20Knights%20men%27s%20basketball">University of Central Florida</a>, where Marcus was attending. Marcus transferred to <a href="Whitney%20M.%20Young%20Magnet%20High%20School">Whitney Young High School</a> after his sophomore year at Loyola Academy and graduated in 2009. He began attending UCF in the fall of 2009, and played three seasons of basketball for the school. Jordan's nephew through his brother Larry, Justin Jordan, played <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I">Division I</a> basketball at <a href="UNC%20Greensboro%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball">UNC Greensboro</a>.

On July 21, 2006, a judge in <a href="Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois">Cook County, Illinois</a>, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim. Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret. Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a <a href="Paternity%20law">paternity suit</a> after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991. A <a href="Genealogical%20DNA%20test">DNA test</a> showed Jordan was not the father of the child.

He proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model <a href="Yvette%20Prieto">Yvette Prieto</a>, on Christmas 2011, and they were married on April 27, 2013, at <a href="Bethesda-by-the-Sea">Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church</a>. It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together. On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.

Jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>, <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>, <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a>, <a href="Gatorade">Gatorade</a>, <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a>, <a href="Ball%20Park%20Franks">Ball Park Franks</a>, <a href="Spectrum%20Brands">Rayovac</a>, <a href="Wheaties">Wheaties</a>, <a href="Hanes">Hanes</a>, and <a href="MCI%20Communications">MCI</a>. Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the "<a href="Be%20Like%20Mike">Be Like Mike</a>" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.

Nike created a signature shoe for him, called the "<a href="Air%20Jordan">Air Jordan</a>", in 1984. One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved <a href="Spike%20Lee">Spike Lee</a> playing the part of <a href="Mars%20Blackmon">Mars Blackmon</a>. In the commercials Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that "it's gotta be the shoes". The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of "shoe-jackings" where people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the "Jordan Brand". The company features an impressive list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers. The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of <a href="North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels">North Carolina</a>, <a href="California%20Golden%20Bears">California</a>, <a href="Georgetown%20Hoyas">Georgetown</a>, and <a href="Marquette%20Golden%20Eagles">Marquette</a>.

Jordan also has been associated with the <a href="Looney%20Tunes">Looney Tunes</a> cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992's <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXVI">Super Bowl XXVI</a> featured Jordan and <a href="Bugs%20Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a> playing basketball. The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 <a href="Films%20with%20live%20action%20and%20animation">live action/animated</a> film "<a href="Space%20Jam">Space Jam</a>", which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball. They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI. Jordan also made an appearance in the music video of <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s "<a href="Jam%20%28song%29">Jam</a>" (1992).

Jordan's yearly income from the endorsements is estimated to be over forty million dollars. In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games. Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US $30 million per season. An academic study found that Jordan's first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.

Most of Jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, <a href="David%20Falk">David Falk</a>. Jordan has described Falk as "the best at what he does" and that "marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan.'"

In June 2010, Jordan was ranked by "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" magazine as the 20th-most powerful celebrity in the world with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to the Forbes article, Jordan Brand generates $1 billion in sales for Nike. In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%. On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the "Charlotte Business Journal"'s Business Person of the Year for 2014. In 2017, he became a part owner of the <a href="Miami%20Marlins">Miami Marlins</a> of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>.

"Forbes" designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017. From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements, Jordan's 2015 income was an estimated $110 million, the most of any retired athlete. , his current net worth is estimated at $1.9 billion by "Forbes". Jordan is the third-richest African-American as of 2018, behind <a href="Robert%20F.%20Smith%20%28investor%29">Robert F. Smith</a> and <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>.

Jordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name. The company has a <a href="Nissan">Nissan</a> dealership in <a href="Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina">Durham, North Carolina</a>, acquired in 1990, and formerly had a <a href="Lincoln%20Motor%20Company">Lincoln</a>–<a href="Mercury%20%28automobile%29">Mercury</a> dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009. The company also owned a Nissan franchise in <a href="Glen%20Burnie%2C%20Maryland">Glen Burnie, Maryland</a>. The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordan's. His restaurants include a <a href="Michael%20Jordan%27s%20Steakhouse">steakhouse</a> in New York City's <a href="Grand%20Central%20Terminal">Grand Central Terminal</a>, among others.

Jordan has authored several books focusing on his life, basketball career, and world view.
