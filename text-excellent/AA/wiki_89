Cardinal-nephew

A cardinal-nephew (; ; ; ) was a <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">cardinal</a> elevated by a <a href="pope">pope</a> who was that cardinal's relative. The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries. The last cardinal-nephew was named in 1689 and the practice was extinguished in 1692. The word "<a href="nepotism">nepotism</a>" originally referred specifically to this practice, when it appeared in the <a href="English%20language">English language</a> about 1669. From the middle of the <a href="Avignon%20Papacy">Avignon Papacy</a> (1309–1377) until <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20XII">Pope Innocent XII</a>'s anti-nepotism <a href="papal%20bull">bull</a> (a papal charter), "<a href="Romanum%20decet%20pontificem">Romanum decet pontificem</a>" (1692), a pope without a cardinal-nephew was the exception to the rule. Every <a href="Renaissance%20Papacy">Renaissance pope</a> who created cardinals appointed a relative to the <a href="College%20of%20Cardinals">College of Cardinals</a>, and the nephew was the most common choice, although one of <a href="Alexander%20VI">Alexander VI</a>'s creations was his own son.

The institution of the cardinal-nephew evolved over seven centuries, tracking developments in the <a href="history%20of%20the%20papacy">history of the papacy</a> and the styles of individual Popes. From 1566 until 1692, a cardinal-nephew held the <a href="Roman%20Curia">curial office</a> of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State, known as the Cardinal Nephew, and thus the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. The curial office of the Cardinal Nephew as well as the institution of the cardinal-nephew declined as the power of the <a href="Cardinal%20Secretary%20of%20State">Cardinal Secretary of State</a> increased and the <a href="Temporal%20power%20%28papal%29">temporal power</a> of popes decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries.

The <a href="list%20of%20cardinal-nephews">list of cardinal-nephews</a> includes at least fifteen, and possibly as many as nineteen popes (<a href="Gregory%20IX">Gregory IX</a>, <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20IV">Alexander IV</a>, <a href="Adrian%20V">Adrian V</a>, <a href="Gregory%20XI">Gregory XI</a>, <a href="Boniface%20IX">Boniface IX</a>, <a href="Innocent%20VII">Innocent VII</a>, <a href="Eugene%20IV">Eugene IV</a>, <a href="Pope%20Paul%20II">Paul II</a>, <a href="Alexander%20VI">Alexander VI</a>, <a href="Pius%20III">Pius III</a>, <a href="Julius%20II">Julius II</a>, <a href="Leo%20X">Leo X</a>, <a href="Clement%20VII">Clement VII</a>, <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XIII">Benedict XIII</a>, and <a href="Pius%20VII">Pius VII</a>; perhaps also <a href="John%20XIX">John XIX</a> and <a href="Benedict%20IX">Benedict IX</a>, if they were really promoted cardinals; as well as <a href="Innocent%20III">Innocent III</a> and <a href="Benedict%20XII">Benedict XII</a>, if in fact they were related to their elevators); one antipope (<a href="Antipope%20John%20XXIII">John XXIII</a>); and two or three saints (<a href="Charles%20Borromeo">Charles Borromeo</a>, <a href="Guarinus%20of%20Palestrina">Guarinus of Palestrina</a>, and perhaps <a href="Anselm%20of%20Lucca">Anselm of Lucca</a>, if he was really a cardinal).

The creation of cardinal-nephews predates the hierarchical preeminence of cardinals within the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, which grew out of the 1059 decree of <a href="Pope%20Nicholas%20II">Pope Nicholas II</a>, "<a href="In%20nomine%20Domini">In nomine Domini</a>", which established <a href="cardinal%20bishop">cardinal bishop</a>s as the sole electors of the Pope, with the consent of <a href="cardinal%20deacon">cardinal deacon</a>s and <a href="cardinal%20priest">cardinal priest</a>s. The first known cardinal-nephew is Lottario (), seniore, cousin of <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20VIII">Pope Benedict VIII</a> (1012–1024), elected circa 1015. Benedict VIII also elevated his brother <a href="Pope%20John%20XIX">Giovanni</a> (the future Pope John XIX) and his cousin <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20IX">Teofilatto</a> (the future Pope Benedict IX) as cardinal-deacons. The first known cardinal-nephew after 1059 is <a href="Anselm%20of%20Lucca">Anselm of Lucca</a>, the nephew or brother of <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20II">Pope Alexander II</a> (1061–1073), although until the end of 12th the majority of the alleged cases of such appointments are dubious, either because the relationship between the Pope and cardinal is not proven, or because the cardinalate of the papal kinsman is uncertain. However, it is beyond doubt that the promotions of papal relatives to the College of Cardinals were <a href="List%20of%20cardinal-nephews%2313th%20century">common in 13th century</a>.

According to historian John Bargrave, "by the <a href="Council%20of%20Florence">Council of Bazill</a>, Session 21, the number of cardinals was not to be above 24, and not any nephew of the Pope or of any cardinal was to be of that number. ("Session" 23.)"
<a href="Pope%20Clement%20VI">Pope Clement VI</a> (1342–1352) created more cardinal-nephews than any other pontiff, including six on September 20, 1342, the greatest number of cardinal-nephews elevated at one time. The <a href="conclave%20capitulation">capitulation</a> of the <a href="Papal%20conclave%2C%201464">1464 papal conclave</a> limited the Pope it elected (<a href="Pope%20Paul%20II">Pope Paul II</a>) to appointing one cardinal-nephew, along with other conditions designed to increase the power of the <a href="College%20of%20Cardinals">College of Cardinals</a> and reduce the Pope's ability to dilute that power.

The <a href="Fifth%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">Fifth Council of the Lateran</a> declared in 1514 that the care of relatives was to be commended, and the creation of cardinal-nephews was often recommended or justified based on the need to care for indigent family members. A cardinal-nephew could usually expect profitable appointments; for example, <a href="Alessandro%20Farnese%20%28cardinal%29">Alessandro Farnese</a>, cardinal-nephew of <a href="Pope%20Paul%20III">Pope Paul III</a> (1534–1549) held 64 <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s simultaneously in addition to the vice-chancellorship.

<a href="Pope%20Paul%20IV">Pope Paul IV</a> (1555–1559), in his old age, was said to have "fallen almost completely under the cardinal-nephew's influence"; Paul IV's cardinal-nephew, <a href="Carlo%20Carafa">Carlo Carafa</a>, was accused in August 1558 by a <a href="Theatines">Theatine</a> of seducing a Roman noble woman, Plautila de' Massimi, who had come into possession of an inordinate amount of money and jewelry, but the accusations were dismissed by the pontiff. Saint <a href="Charles%20Borromeo">Charles Borromeo</a>, cardinal-nephew of <a href="Pope%20Pius%20IV">Pope Pius IV</a> (1559–1565), had ensured the subordination of the "<a href="secretarius%20intimus">secretarius intimus</a>" to the Cardinal Nephew, which came to be sometimes known as the "secretarius maior". Pius IV was notorious for nepotism: between 1561 and 1565 he transferred more than 350,000 "<a href="scudi">scudi</a>" to his relatives.

Following the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a> (1563), <a href="Pope%20Pius%20V">Pope Pius V</a> (1566–1572) drew up the terms for the office of the Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State, who was to handle the temporal affairs of the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a> and the foreign relations of the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>. After abortively attempting to divide the duties of the Superintendent between four non-familial cardinals, Pius V acceded to the urgings of the College of Cardinals and his Spanish ambassador, and appointed his grandnephew, <a href="Michele%20Bonelli">Michele Bonelli</a>, as Superintendent, demarcating his duties with a <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a> of March 14, 1566. However, Pius V relentlessly avoided delegating any real autonomous power to Bonelli.

The Cardinal Nephew (also called "cardinale padrone" or "Secretarius Papae et superintendens status ecclesiasticæ": "Superintendent of the Ecclesiastical State", ) was an official <a href="Papal%20legate">legate</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Roman Curia</a>, approximately equivalent to the <a href="Cardinal%20Secretary%20of%20State">Cardinal Secretary of State</a>, which absorbed its functions after the office of Cardinal Nephew was abolished in 1692. The office has been likened by historians to a "<a href="prime%20minister">prime minister</a>", ""<a href="alter%20ego">alter ego</a>"", or "vice-pope". The Cardinal Nephew was generally among a Pope's first cardinal creations, and his "creature" was traditionally accompanied by a <a href="salute">salute</a> from the guns of <a href="Castel%20Sant%27Angelo">Castel Sant'Angelo</a>.

Following the <a href="Avignon%20Papacy">Avignon Papacy</a>, the Cardinal Nephew was responsible for the spiritual and temporal governance of the <a href="Comtat%20Venaissin">Comtat Venaissin</a>, where the Avignon Popes had resided; in 1475, <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20IV">Pope Sixtus IV</a> raised the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Avignon">Diocese of Avignon</a> to the rank of an archbishopric, to the benefit of his nephew <a href="Giuliano%20della%20Rovere">Giuliano della Rovere</a>.

The terms of the office of Cardinal Nephew were established by a <a href="papal%20brief">papal brief</a> developed and refined by Pius V's successors to <a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Paul V</a> (1605–1621). The Cardinal Nephew was also the correspondence liaison for all <a href="papal%20nuncio">papal nuncio</a>s and <a href="Papal%20legate">gubernatorial legates</a>, and the prefect for two congregations: the <a href="Consulta">Consulta</a> and the <a href="Congregazione%20del%20Buon%20Governo">Congregazione del Buon Governo</a>. The Cardinal Nephew was also the captain-general of the papal army and a "channel through which flowed benefices one way and gold the other".

However, these formal functions only came into force during the pontificates of unusually weak Popes; most Cardinal Nephews were the "de facto" <a href="Rubber%20stamp%20%28politics%29">rubber stamp</a> of the pontiff himself.

Although <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XI">Pope Leo XI</a> (1605) died before he was able to elevate his nephew, <a href="Roberto%20Ubaldini">Roberto Ubaldini</a>, Ubaldini was elevated by Leo XI's successor, <a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Pope Paul V</a> in 1615.

Some historians consider <a href="Scipione%20Borghese">Scipione Borghese</a>, cardinal-nephew to <a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Pope Paul V</a>, to be the "prototypical representative" of a cardinal-nephew, unlike those before him, created to "provide for and oversee the permanent social and economic ascent of the reigning papal family into the ranks of the high Roman aristocracy". For example, in 1616, 24 of the 30 abbeys belonging to Borghese were rented out, a practice the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a> had attempted to eliminate. A thorough financial analysis of Borghese's cardinalate by Reinhard Volcker (based on a series of extant account books) examines the strategies Borghese used to build up wealth during his uncle's pontificate and non-ecclesiastical assets before his uncle's death, which Volcker considers to be exemplary of <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> papal families. It is estimated that Paul V Borghese had transferred to his family approximately 4% of the total income of the Holy See during his pontificate. Borghese's personal revenues in 1610 were 153,000 "scudi" compared to the mere 4,900 "scudi" that constituted his entire family's income in 1592.

<a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XIV">Pope Gregory XIV</a> (1590–1591) began the practice of creating cardinal-nephews whose formal appointment coincided "de facto" with their nomination, and was thus separate from the ordinal process for creating cardinals, and, when he fell ill, he authorized his cardinal-nephew, <a href="Paolo%20Emilio%20Sfondrato">Paolo Emilio Sfondrato</a>, to use the "<a href="Fiat%20ut%20petitur">Fiat ut petitur</a>", a power which was later diminished at the urging of the College. Paul V issued a "<a href="motu%20proprio">motu proprio</a>" on April 30, 1618, formally bestowing on his cardinal-nephew the same authority <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VIII">Pope Clement VIII</a> had given to <a href="Pietro%20Aldobrandini">Pietro Aldobrandini</a>, beginning what historian Laurain-Portemer calls "l'age classique'" of <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a>.

<a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XV">Pope Gregory XV</a>'s (1621–1623) cardinal-nephew, <a href="Ludovico%20Ludovisi">Ludovico Ludovisi</a>, the first cardinal-nephew known as "il cardinale padrone" ("the Cardinal boss") accumulated a vast array of benefices: the bishopric of <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, 23 <a href="abbey">abbey</a>s, the directorship of the <a href="Apostolic%20Signatura">Apostolic Signatura</a>, as well as the offices of the vice-chancellor and high-chamberlain, and was able to have most of them redistributed among 17 of his kinsmen upon his death. These benefices and offices netted Ludovisi more than 200,000 <a href="scudi">scudi</a> annually, and he is considered to have exercised "more unlimited authority" than any previous cardinal-nephew. Notably, cardinal-nephews were allowed to create "<a href="facultas%20testandi">facultas testandi</a>" to will the rewards of their benefices to secular family members. Gregory XV's successor, <a href="Pope%20Urban%20VIII">Urban VIII</a> (1623–1644) convened two special committees of theologians, both of whom endorsed this practice.

Not all Cardinal Nephews were cardinal-nephews in the strictest sense. In fact, papal historian Valérie Pirie considers not having a nephew a "tremendous asset for a would-be Pope" as it left the position open for an ally cardinal. For example, <a href="Pope%20Clement%20X">Pope Clement X</a> gave the office to Cardinal Paoluzzi-Altieri, whose nephew had recently married Laura Caterina Altieri, the sole heiress of Clement X's family. Many historians consider <a href="Olimpia%20Maidalchini">Olimpia Maidalchini</a>, the sister-in-law of <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20X">Pope Innocent X</a> (1644–1655), to have been a "de facto" Cardinal Nephew; the position was formally held by her son, <a href="Camillo%20Francesco%20Maria%20Pamphili">Camillo Pamphili</a>, then her nephew, <a href="Francesco%20Maidalchini">Francesco Maidalchini</a> (after Pamphili renounced his cardinalate in order to wed), and (after Francesco proved incompetent) <a href="Camillo%20Astalli">Camillo Astalli</a>, her cousin.

Popes often had only a few choices for the creation of a Cardinal Nephew. According to papal historian Frederic Baumgartner, <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20V">Pope Sixtus V</a>'s (1585–1590) reign "started badly" because <a href="Alessandro%20Peretti%20di%20Montalto">Alessandro Peretti di Montalto</a> was "his only nephew eligible for the office, but he could hardly serve the Pope as a trustworthy confidant", causing several cardinals to refuse to attend his investiture. Another papal historian <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Pastor">Ludwig von Pastor</a> notes that "the misfortune of Pope Pamphilj was that the only person in his family who would have had the qualities necessary to fill such a position was a woman".

<a href="Pope%20Innocent%20XI">Pope Innocent XI</a> (1676–1689) despised the practice and only accepted his election as Pope after the <a href="College%20of%20Cardinals">College of Cardinals</a> consented to his plans for reform, which included a ban on nepotism. However, Innocent XI backed down after thrice failing to achieve the support of the majority of his cardinals for a bull banning nepotism, which had been tediously composed between 1677 and 1686. Innocent XI refused entreaties from within the papal court to bring his only nephew, <a href="Livio%20Odescalchi">Livio Odescalchi</a>, the prince of <a href="Sirmio">Sirmio</a>, to Rome, although he did elevate Carlo Stefano Anastasio Ciceri, a distant relative, cardinal on September 2, 1686. Innocent XI's successor, <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20VIII">Pope Alexander VIII</a> (1689–1691), was the last Pope to create a Cardinal Nephew. Alexander VIII also undid another reform of Innocent XI by restoring the revenues of the former <a href="Chancery%20of%20Apostolic%20Briefs">Chancery</a> to the <a href="Vice-Chancellor">Vice-Chancellor</a>, who was, at the time, his cardinal-nephew, <a href="Pietro%20Ottoboni%20%28cardinal%29">Pietro Ottoboni</a>. Edith Standen, a consultant to the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, calls Ottoboni the "last and certainly not least magnificent example" of the "splendor of an extinct species, the Cardinal-Nephew".

Until 1692 (and sometimes thereafter), the cardinal-nephew (or a lay nephew) would be the chief <a href="archive">archivist</a> of the Pope, usually removing the archives to a family archive upon the death of the pontiff. In particular, the archival collections of the <a href="Barberini">Barberini</a>, <a href="House%20of%20Farnese">Farnese</a>, <a href="Chigi-Albani">Chigi</a>, and <a href="House%20of%20Borghese">Borghese</a> families contain important papal documents.

<a href="Pope%20Innocent%20XII">Pope Innocent XII</a> (1691–1700) issued a <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a> on June 22, 1692, "<a href="Romanum%20decet%20pontificem">Romanum decet pontificem</a>", banning the office of Cardinal Nephew, limiting his successors to elevating only one cardinal relative, eliminating various "<a href="sinecure">sinecure</a>s" traditionally reserved for cardinal-nephews, and capping the <a href="stipend">stipend</a> or <a href="Financial%20endowment">endowment</a> the nephew of a Pope could receive to 12,000 <a href="scudi">scudi</a>. "Romanum decet pontificem" was later incorporated into the <a href="Code%20of%20Canon%20Law%20of%201917">Code of Canon Law of 1917</a> in canons 240, 2; 1414, 4; and 1432, 1. In 1694, Innocent XII's series of reforms was concluded with an expensive campaign to eliminate the "<a href="venality">venality</a>" of offices while reimbursing their current holders. These reforms are viewed by some scholars as a delayed reaction to the financial crisis created by the nepotism of <a href="Pope%20Urban%20VIII">Pope Urban VIII</a> (1623–1644).

However, even following "Romanum decet pontificem", only three of the eight Popes of the 18th century failed to make a nephew or brother cardinal. The <a href="College%20of%20Cardinals">College of Cardinals</a> apparently preferred rule by nephews than by favorites, which they perceived as the alternative; for example, the College urged <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XIII">Pope Benedict XIII</a> (1724–1730) to appoint a cardinal-nephew, who they hoped would replace Benedict XIII's notorious lieutenant <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Coscia">Niccolò Coscia</a>. <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XIII">Pope Gregory XIII</a> (1572–1585) also had to be urged by key figures in the College to appoint his cardinal-nephew: Filippo Boncompagni.

The cardinal-nephews of the 18th century declined in influence as the power of the <a href="Cardinal%20Secretary%20of%20State">Cardinal Secretary of State</a> increased. The church of <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XIII">Pope Benedict XIII</a> (1724–1730) is described by historian Eamon Duffy as "all the evils of nepotism without the nephew".
<a href="Neri%20Maria%20Corsini">Neri Maria Corsini</a>, cardinal-nephew of <a href="Pope%20Clement%20XII">Pope Clement XII</a> (1730–1740) was by far the most powerful cardinal-nephew of the 18th century, on account of his uncle's advanced age and <a href="blindness">blindness</a>. However, Clement XII's successor, <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XIV">Pope Benedict XIV</a> (1740–1758) was described by <a href="Hugh%20Walpole">Hugh Walpole</a> as "a priest without indolence or interest, a prince without favorites, a Pope without nephews".

<a href="Romualdo%20Braschi-Onesti">Romualdo Braschi-Onesti</a>, cardinal-nephew of <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VI">Pius VI</a> (1775–1799), was the penultimate cardinal-nephew. Despite Pius VI's lineage to a noble <a href="Cesena">Cesena</a> family, his only sister had married a man from the poor Onesti family. Therefore, he commissioned a <a href="genealogy">genealogist</a> to discover (and inflate) some trace of nobility in the Onesti lineage, an endeavor which yielded only a circuitous connection to Saint Romualdo.

After the turbulent <a href="papal%20conclave%2C%201800">1800 papal conclave</a>, <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VII">Pope Pius VII</a> (1800–1823) shunned the institution of the cardinal-nephew and instead relied on his <a href="Cardinal%20Secretary%20of%20State">Cardinal Secretary of State</a>, <a href="Ercole%20Consalvi">Ercole Consalvi</a>. During the 19th century, the only nephew of a Pope created cardinal was <a href="Gabriele%20della%20Genga%20Sermattei">Gabriele della Genga Sermattei</a>, nephew of <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XII">Pope Leo XII</a>, created cardinal by <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XVI">Pope Gregory XVI</a> on February 1, 1836. Although the institutionalization of nepotism disappeared in the 18th century, "<a href="pietas">pietas</a>" (duty to family) remained a theme of papal administration into the 20th century, although rarely with the overt intervention of a papal uncle. Following the example of Pius VI, Popes <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Leo XIII</a> (who elevated his brother, <a href="Giuseppe%20Pecci">Giuseppe Pecci</a>, cardinal on May 12, 1879) and <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pius XII</a> (1939–1958) weakened the formal curial bureaucracy in favor of a parallel government, in which family members often figured prominently. The loss of <a href="Temporal%20power%20%28papal%29">temporal power</a> over the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a> ("de facto" in 1870 with the "<a href="Roman%20Question">Roman Question</a>" and "de jure" in 1929 with the <a href="Lateran%20Treaty">Lateran Treaty</a>) also eliminated the structural conditions which had figured prominently in the family politics of earlier Popes.

Even into the 18th century, the cardinal-nephew was a natural <a href="Power%20broker%20%28term%29">power broker</a> at the <a href="papal%20conclave">conclave</a> following his uncle's death, as a figure whom cardinals desirous of continuing the "<a href="status%20quo">status quo</a>" could rally around. In particular, the cardinal-nephew often commanded the loyalty of his uncle's "creatures", whom he generally had a role in naming. For example, <a href="Alessandro%20Peretti%20di%20Montalto">Alessandro Peretti di Montalto</a> led his uncle's creatures in the papal conclave of 1590 despite being only 21. According to conclave historian Frederic Baumgartner, "the purpose of such appointments was ensuring that the Pope's family would have power and influence for a much longer time than the brief period that a Pope could expect to reign". A notable exception is <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XV">Pope Gregory XV</a> (1621–1623) who declined on his death bed the request of <a href="Ludovico%20Ludovisi">Ludovico Ludovisi</a> to name more relatives to the College, saying he had "enough to account to God for the unworthy ones he had appointed".

However, cardinal-nephews were not guaranteed the leadership of their uncle's "creatures"; for example, in the <a href="papal%20conclave%2C%201621">papal conclave, 1621</a>, <a href="Scipione%20Borghese">Scipione Borghese</a> could count only twenty-nine votes (a fraction of his uncle's fifty-six cardinals), <a href="Pietro%20Aldobrandini">Pietro Aldobrandini</a> controlled only nine (of his uncle's thirteen remaining cardinals), and Montalto only five of his uncle's remaining cardinals. In fact, international rivalries sometimes overwhelmed family loyalties when cardinal-nephews were relatively "poorly organized". As <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20X">Pope Innocent X</a> (1644–1655) died with the office of Cardinal Nephew vacant his faction proved divided and leaderless in the conclave, although his sister-in-law <a href="Olimpia%20Maidalchini">Olimpia Maidalchini</a> was invited to address the cardinals from within the enclosure, the only woman ever so honored.

"Instruzione al cardinal Padrone circa il modo come si deve procurare una fazione di cardinali con tutti i requisiti che deve avere per lo stabilimento della sua grandezza" ("Instructions to the chief cardinal on how to create a faction of cardinals with all the requisites for the establishment of his grandeur"), discovered in the archive of the <a href="Santa%20Maria%20in%20Monserrato%20degli%20Spagnoli">Santa Maria de Monserrato</a> offers advice to cardinal-nephews for consolidating power within the College of Cardinals. Another text, the "Ricordi dati da Gregorio XV al cardinale Lodovisio suo nipote" ("Memoir addressed by <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XV">Gregory XV</a> to his Nephew Cardinal Lodovisio") offers advice for how to rise within the Curia.

An analysis of the five papal conclaves between 1605 and 1644 shows that cardinal-nephews were generally unsuccessful in electing their chosen candidates, although the victor was usually a cardinal created by the deceased Pope. <a href="Crown-cardinal">Crown-cardinal</a>s in particular, when they deigned to travel to Rome for the conclave, tended to oppose the election of cardinal-nephews, although they equally opposed the election of crown-cardinals of other monarchs. In general, a cardinal-nephew had to outlive one or more successors of his uncle to become regarded as "<a href="papabile">papabile</a>", both because of their youth and their tendency to be blamed for any unpopular papal policies of their uncles.

A papal election could bring a dramatic change of fortune for a cardinal-nephew, often bringing the former favorites into conflict with the new Pope. For example, <a href="Prospero%20Colonna%20%28cardinal%29">Prospero Colonna</a> and <a href="Francisco%20de%20Borja">Francisco de Borja</a> were <a href="excommunication">excommunicated</a>, and <a href="Carlo%20Carafa">Carlo Carafa</a> was <a href="List%20of%20people%20executed%20by%20the%20Holy%20See">executed</a>. The <a href="papal%20conclave%2C%20May%201605">papal conclave, May 1605</a>, is one example of a conclave where a candidate (<a href="Antonmaria%20Sauli">Antonmaria Sauli</a>) was defeated because enough other cardinals were convinced of the need for "a Pope willing to punish the cardinal-nephews for robbing the papacy". A cardinal-nephew was also a potential threat to any future pontiff; for example, Ludovisi came to lead the opposition against <a href="Pope%20Urban%20VIII">Pope Urban VIII</a> (1623–1644), even talking about calling a council against the Pope (which never occurred as Ludovisi died in 1632) because "no one else had the standing to confront Urban's titanic temper".

<a href="Nepotism">Nepotism</a> is a common feature in the history of governance, particularly in cultures where identity and loyalty are determined more at the level of the family than that of the <a href="nation-state">nation-state</a>. The use of nephews, rather than direct descendants, is a product of the tradition of <a href="clerical%20celibacy%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">clerical celibacy within the Catholic Church</a>, although <a href="heredity">hereditary descent</a> from uncles to nephews is also seen in the <a href="List%20of%20Patriarchs%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20the%20East">patriarchate</a> of the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a>.

The creation of relatives and known-allies as cardinals was only one way in which medieval and Renaissance Popes attempted to dilute the power of the <a href="College%20of%20Cardinals">College of Cardinals</a> as an "ecclesiastical rival" and perpetuate their influence within the church after their death. The institution of the cardinal-nephew had the effect both of enriching the Pope's family with desirable <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s and of modernizing the administration of the papacy, by allowing the pontiff to rule through a proxy which was more easily deemed <a href="Papal%20infallibility">fallible</a> when necessary and provided a formal distance between the person of the pontiff and the everydayness of pontifical affairs.

<a href="Gregorio%20Leti">Gregorio Leti</a>'s "Papal Nepotism, or the True Relation of the Reasons Which Impel the Popes to make their Nephews Powerful" (1667) is one example of contemporary criticism of the institution of the cardinal-nephew; Leti holds the rare distinction of having "all" of his publications on the "<a href="Index%20Librorum%20Prohibitorum">Index Librorum Prohibitorum</a>" ("List of Prohibited Books"). The "<a href="Catholic%20Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a>" of 1913 defended the institution of the cardinal-nephew as a necessary countermeasure to the intrigue of the old Church. According to Francis A. Burkle-Young, 15th century Popes in particular found it necessary to elevate their relatives to the College of Cardinals due to their distrust of the <a href="crown-cardinal">crown-cardinal</a>s, Roman baronial families, and Italian princely families who also populated the college.
According to <a href="Thomas%20Adolphus%20Trollope">Thomas Adolphus Trollope</a>, a famed papal historian, "the evil wrought by them in and to the church has been well nigh fatal to it; and it continued to increase until increasing danger warned the Pontiffs to abstain. The worst cardinals, providing, of course, the material for the worst Popes, have been for the most part cardinal nephews, the temptation to the creation of such having been rendered too great to be resisted by the exorbitant greatness of the power, dignity, and wealth attributed to the members of the Sacred College. The value of these great "prizes" was so enormous, that the "hat" became an object of ambition to princes, and it was the primary object with a long series of Popes to bestow it on their kinsmen."

The curial office of <a href="Cardinal%20Secretary%20of%20State">Cardinal Secretary of State</a> in many ways evolved from the roles formerly filled by cardinal-nephews. From 1644 to 1692, the power of the Cardinal Secretary of State was essentially inversely proportional to that of the Cardinal Nephew, to whom the Secretariat was subordinate. During some pontificates, for example that of <a href="Pope%20Pius%20V">Pope Pius V</a> (1566–1572) and his nephew <a href="Michele%20Bonelli">Michele Bonelli</a>, the cardinal-nephew and secretary of state were one and the same.

According to Baumgartner, "the rise of a centralized administration with professional bureaucrats with careers in the papal service" proved more effective than nepotism for future Popes and thus "greatly reduced the need for papal nephews". The rise of the Cardinal Secretary of State was the "most obvious element of this new approach".

Go Man Go

Go Man Go (1953–1983) was an <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse">American Quarter Horse</a> <a href="stallion">stallion</a> and <a href="Horse%20racing">race horse</a>. He was named World Champion Quarter Running Horse three times in a row, one of only two horses to achieve that distinction. Go Man Go was considered to be of difficult temperament. While waiting in the <a href="starting%20gate">starting gate</a> for his very first race, he threw his jockey, broke down the gate, and ran alone around the track; he was eventually caught and went on to win the race. During his five years of competition until his retirement from racing in 1960 he had 27 wins, earning more than $86,000 (approximately $ as of 2019).

Neither of Go Man Go's parents raced. His sire (father), the <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> stallion <a href="Top%20Deck%20%28horse%29">Top Deck</a>, was bred by the <a href="King%20Ranch">King Ranch</a>. His <a href="mare">dam</a> (mother) hailed from Louisiana; Go Man Go is thought to have gained his swiftness on the track from her. For the first years of Go Man Go's racing career, his owner faced difficulty in registering him with the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association">American Quarter Horse Association</a> (AQHA), a matter that remained unresolved until 1958.

Go Man Go went on to sire two <a href="All%20American%20Futurity">All American Futurity</a> winners and seven Champion Quarter Running Horses. He was inducted into the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Hall%20of%20Fame">American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame</a>, as were two of his offspring. His daughters also produced, or were the mothers of, a number of race winners, including the Hall of Fame members <a href="Kaweah%20Bar">Kaweah Bar</a> and <a href="Rocket%20Wrangler">Rocket Wrangler</a>. The director of racing for the AQHA once compared his impact on Quarter Horse racing and breeding to that of <a href="Man%20o%27%20War">Man o' War</a> in <a href="Thoroughbred%20horse%20race">Thoroughbred racing</a>, or that of human athletes such as <a href="Ben%20Hogan">Ben Hogan</a> and <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>.

Go Man Go was <a href="foal">foal</a>ed in <a href="Wharton%2C%20Texas">Wharton, Texas</a> in 1953, as a result of the second breeding between the Thoroughbred stallion Top Deck and the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Registration">Appendix Quarter Horse</a> <a href="Mare%20%28horse%29">mare</a> Lightfoot Sis. Top Deck was bred by the King Ranch, and was unraced. J. B. Ferguson had purchased Lightfoot Sis when her then-owner, Octave Fontenot of Prairie Ronde, Louisiana, decided to get out of the <a href="horse%20breeding">horse breeding</a> business. Ferguson paid $350 for her (approximately $ as of 2019) and bred her in 1952 to Top Deck (TB), resulting in Go Man Go's birth the next year. Ferguson also purchased Top Deck, after the stallion injured himself as a yearling.

Lightfoot Sis showed classic short speed in her pedigree, although she was unraced due to an injury as a <a href="filly">filly</a> that left her blind in one eye. Her sire was the Thoroughbred stallion Very Wise, and her dam was a Quarter Horse mare named Clear Track.

Scott Wells, a racing correspondent, wrote in "The Speedhorse Magazine" that Go Man Go "grew up lean and hard-boned, long-bodied and long-hipped, but not the best looking horse in the world. Not the best looking, just the best." Go Man Go had a reputation for being difficult to handle. His trainer once told Walt Wiggins, Sr. that Go Man Go was "jes plain mean as a bear most of the time". Throughout his racing career, Go Man Go stayed mean. One of his jockeys, Robert Strauss, recalled later that Go Man Go "was ornery from the day I met him, but he was the greatest horse I ever rode".

In his five-year racing career, Go Man Go competed in 47 races. He appeared to take naturally to racing; during his training he ran off with his rider—his eventual jockey Robert Strauss—before he was supposed to run. As Strauss said, "When we were breaking him, he ran off with me before we ever wanted him to run. I mean, just flat ran off with me." Robert's brother Eldridge, who was the trainer, once worked the colt minus half a shoe and Go Man Go still managed a time of 18.9 seconds for a distance.

In the moments before his very first race began, Go Man Go flipped over in the starting gate, unseated his rider, crashed through the front, and ran around the whole track. He finally allowed himself to be caught and reloaded into the starting gate and went on to win that race. He won his next five races with a total lead of nine <a href="Length%20%28horse%20racing%29">horse-lengths</a>. He faced Vandy's Flash, himself a World Champion Quarter Racing Horse, twelve times. Their last meeting, on September 6, 1959 at <a href="Ruidoso%20Downs%20%28track%29">Ruidoso Downs</a>, was also Go Man Go's final race, and was the only one of their races won by Vandy's Flash.

Go Man Go won 27 times, placed second 9 times and was third 3 times. Because he placed so regularly, by the end of his racing career tracks had difficulty filling races if other racing stables knew he was entered. His race earnings were $86,151 (approximately $ as of 2019) with 88 AQHA racing points, which earned him a Superior Race Horse award as well as a Race Register of Merit from the AQHA. The best <a href="Speed%20index">speed rating</a>, or racing grade, he achieved was AAAT, the highest grade awarded at the time. Go Man Go was named World Champion Quarter Running Horse for three years running, from 1955 to 1957. He was the first two-year-old to win the title. He was a multiple <a href="Graded%20stakes%20race">stakes</a> winner, and his wins included the Pacific Coast Quarter Racing Association Futurity, LA Autumn Championship, and the Clabbertown G Stakes, which he won three times in a row. At his retirement, he held the world records at and , as well as age and sex records at . Go Man Go is still the only stallion who has been World Champion Quarter Running Horse three times, and, along with the mare Woven Web (TB), is one of only two horses to be three-time winners of the award.

In 1955, when Go Man Go was a two-year-old, A.B. Green bragged that he intended to buy the horse from Ferguson. Although Ferguson did not want to sell, he felt he had to at least set a price. After hearing rumors that Green was prepared with a <a href="cashier%27s%20check">cashier's check</a> for $40,000 (approximately $ as of 2019), Ferguson set the price at $42,000 cash (approximately $ as of 2019) and twenty-one breedings to the stallion. To Ferguson's surprise, Green had that much cash available; Ferguson felt compelled to sell Go Man Go. Two years later, at a <a href="Los%20Alamitos%20Race%20Course">Los Alamitos</a> race meet, Green claimed that his newest horse, Double Bid, could outrace Go Man Go. This incensed Ferguson, who had just entered Go Man Go's full brother Mr Mackay in a race with Double Bid. Ferguson bet Green $42,000 (approximately $ as of 2019) against Go Man Go that Mr Mackay would beat Double Bid in the upcoming race. Mr Mackay won the race, and Ferguson regained ownership of Go Man Go. Later in 1960, because he also owned Go Man Go's full brother, father, and mother, he sold Go Man Go to Frank Vessels Sr. and Bill and Harriet Peckham for $125,000 (approximately $ as of 2019). Later, however, all three horses retained by Ferguson died prematurely.

Green ran into problems with Go Man Go's registration. At that time, the AQHA had two types of registration, the Appendix and the Tentative. Appendix-registered horses were the offspring of Thoroughbreds and either Tentative-registered Quarter Horses or Appendix-registered Quarter Horses. Go Man Go was originally registered in the Appendix, as his dam was an Appendix-registered mare. The way to advance out of the Appendix into the Tentative registry was to qualify on performance grounds and pass a <a href="equine%20conformation">conformation</a> examination conducted by the AQHA. Go Man Go certainly qualified under the performance criteria, but his conformation was such that he resembled a Thoroughbred more than he resembled a Quarter Horse. Green knew that in order to increase his <a href="stud%20fee">stud fee</a>s—the price paid for the right to breed a mare to a stallion—Go Man Go needed to acquire a regular registration number instead of his Appendix number. So Green appealed to the Executive Committee of the AQHA, which had the authority to award Tentative numbers to horses regardless of conformation exam results. In both 1956 and 1957, the committee declined to take action, waiting to evaluate the quality of Go Man Go's first foals before making a decision. Finally, in 1958, they awarded Go Man Go number 82,000 in the Tentative registry.

Retired to the breeding shed, Go Man Go early on proved his worth as a <a href="Stallion%20%28horse%29">stallion</a>. Of his first foal crop, born in 1958, three reached the finals of the All American Futurity: Mr Meyers, Dynago Miss and Angie Miss. His stud fee in 1960 was $500 (approximately $ as of 2019), but by 1963 it had risen to $2,500 (approximately $ as of 2019). He sired 942 foals, of which 552 earned their Race Register of Merit. Seventy-two of his offspring were awarded a Superior Race Horse award. Among his <a href="get%20%28animal%29">get</a>, or offspring, were Go Josie Go, Dynago Miss, Duplicate Copy, Story Man, and Hustling Man. His daughter <a href="Goetta">Goetta</a> won the All American Futurity and was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame. Another daughter, <a href="Ought%20To%20Go">Ought To Go</a> was also inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame. Two grandget were also inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame: Kaweah Bar and Rocket Wrangler. Eight of his offspring won Champion Quarter Running Horse awards. His entry listing his offspring who won Race Register of Merits in the "Quarter Racing Digest" covers five full pages plus part of another. As a broodmare sire, or maternal grandsire, his daughters have produced Rocket Wrangler, Mr Kid Charge, Kaweah Bar, and Go Together. As of April 2008, his offspring had earned over $7,000,000 on the racetrack.

As a breeding stallion, Go Man Go continued to have a reputation as a scoundrel, although Kathlyn Green, wife of A. B. Green, disputed that image. She said that he liked to have his lip tugged, and would lean over the stall door waiting for people to come along and tug on it for him. However, she said of him "he absolutely hated getting his feet dirty". Go Man Go passed through a number of hands after Green owned him, including Les Gosselin, Frank Vessels, and Harriett Peckham, who was his owner by 1972. In 1967, when Vessels sold his half-interest in Go Man Go to Briarwood Farms, the deal was said to be a record price for a Quarter Horse. Go Man Go died in 1983 and was buried near the headquarters of the Buena Suerte Ranch in <a href="Roswell%2C%20New%20Mexico">Roswell, New Mexico</a>. His crown-shaped granite headstone is engraved: "Go Man Go, The King."

Go Man Go was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1990. A further honor was the naming of a stakes race after him, the <a href="Graded%20stakes%20race">Grade I</a> Go Man Go Handicap run in September at Los Alamitos. Walt Wiggins, a racing commentator and author, said of Go Man Go: "He was a brilliant speedhorse, some say the fastest ever. He was wild and reckless, a rogue at first, and often a clown who seldom saw the uniqueness of his talents or the seriousness of his commission. He had intrinsic greatness and couldn't care less." Dan Essary, who was Director of Racing for the AQHA for many years, described Go Man Go's impact on the Quarter Horse breed as "He was to Quarter Horse racing what Babe Ruth was to baseball, what Ben Hogan was to Golf and what Man o'War was to Thoroughbred racing. Horses may have run faster and horses have earned more money, but the fame of Go Man Go lingers."

God of War: Betrayal

God of War: Betrayal is a <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">two-dimensional</a> (2D) <a href="Side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> <a href="mobile%20game">mobile game</a> developed by <a href="Javaground">Javaground</a> and <a href="Sony%20Online%20Entertainment">Sony Online Entertainment</a>'s (SOE) Los Angeles division, and published by <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Digital">Sony Pictures Digital</a>. Released for <a href="mobile%20phone">mobile phone</a>s supporting the <a href="Java%20Platform%2C%20Micro%20Edition">Java Platform, Micro Edition</a> (Java ME) on June 20, 2007, it is the third installment in the <a href="God%20of%20War%20%28franchise%29">"God of War" series</a>, and the fifth chronologically. Loosely based on <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, "Betrayal" is set in <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls the protagonist <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a>, who became the new God of War after killing the former, <a href="Ares">Ares</a>. Kratos is framed for the murder of <a href="Argus%20Panoptes">Argos</a> and pursues the true assassin across Greece, resulting in a confrontation with <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian</a> messenger <a href="Ceryx">Ceryx</a>.

"Betrayal" is the only installment in the series to be released on a non-<a href="PlayStation">PlayStation</a> platform and presented as a 2D side-scrolling game. Despite the limitations of the mobile platform, in comparison to its <a href="Video%20game%20console">home console</a> counterparts, it retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the same combination of <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo-based combat</a>, <a href="Platform%20game">platforming</a>, and <a href="Puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle game</a> elements. Although "God of War" is primarily a home console series, "Betrayal" was praised for its fidelity to the series in terms of gameplay, art style, and graphics: "the real deal third game in the killer franchise". It received awards for "Wireless Game of the Month" (June 2007) and "Best Platform Game" (wireless) of 2007.

Although presented in <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">two-dimensional</a> <a href="Side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> format, the game retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the player controlling the character Kratos in the same combination of <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combat</a>, <a href="Platform%20game">platforming</a>, and <a href="Puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle game</a> elements. Platforming elements include jumping across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos to move a box on top of a switch (thus activating it), or moving a box to use it as a jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable with normal jumping. Game length is approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.

Kratos retains his main weapon of the previous installments, the Blades of Athena: a pair of <a href="blade">blade</a>s attached to <a href="Chain%20weapon">chains</a> that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. Kratos utilizes the <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">magical</a> abilities <a href="Medusa">Medusa</a>'s Gaze and Army of <a href="Hades">Hades</a> acquired in the original "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29">God of War</a>", as well as the secondary weapon, the Blade of <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>, with each offering alternative combat options, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies (e.g., Medusa's Gaze briefly turns enemies to stone). Foes encountered in "Betrayal" primarily stem from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, including Gorgons, <a href="minotaur">minotaur</a>s, and <a href="cerberus">cerberus</a>es, as well as those created for the game, such as the humanoid minions of the god Hades, including dead riders and undead legionnaires. In addition to the main gameplay, "Betrayal" includes a bonus "Arena Mode" where players must kill a certain number of enemies without dying before gaining access to the Arena's upper levels.

As with the previous games in the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%28franchise%29">God of War</a>" franchise, "God of War: Betrayal" is set in an alternate version of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>, populated by the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian Gods</a> and other beings of Greek mythology. Events are set between those of the games "" (2010) and "<a href="God%20of%20War%20II">God of War II</a>" (2007). The protagonist is <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a>, a former Captain of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>'s army who became the new God of War after killing his predecessor, <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, the previous God of War. Other characters include <a href="Argus%20Panoptes">Argos</a>, the giant pet of the goddess <a href="Hera">Hera</a>; an unknown assassin; and the Olympian messenger <a href="Ceryx">Ceryx</a>, the son of <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> and main antagonist. <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>, the King of the Gods, is an <a href="unseen%20character">unseen character</a>.

Kratos is leading the Spartan army in a rampage across Greece. During the campaign, he is attacked by a number of beasts led by Argos, who was sent by the gods to stop Kratos. After a series of skirmishes, Argos is killed by an unknown assassin, who frames Kratos in an attempt to turn the gods against him. The Spartan pursues his foe across Greece to discover the identity of the assassin, but is slowed by constant attacks from the minions of Hades, the God of the Underworld. Zeus sends Ceryx to deliver a message to Kratos: stop the relentless pursuit and take heed of the destruction already caused. Kratos, however, battles and kills Ceryx, which inadvertently allows the assassin to escape. Kratos then realizes his actions have further alienated the gods, and Zeus will soon act in response to his defiance.

"God of War: Betrayal" was announced by <a href="Sony%20Online%20Entertainment">Sony Online Entertainment</a> at a press conference in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three dimensional</a> (3D) graphics. The character art and animation were done by <a href="WayForward%20Technologies">WayForward Technologies</a>. The only audio components are an orchestral score in the main menu and background sounds (e.g., clashing weapons). In August 2007, Phil Cohen, producer, designer, and game director for "Betrayal", spoke of the difficulties in developing a "God of War" game for a mobile device. Cohen said that although enjoyable, the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred <a href="kilobytes">kilobytes</a>, and that met series creator <a href="SCE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">Santa Monica Studio</a>'s high standards. He wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end handsets were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end handsets completed by June 2007. The <a href="porting">porting</a> team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks.

Cohen stated that one challenge was capturing the feel of "God of War"s visual look and gameplay design, given the limited processing power and memory on most handsets—complicating puzzle design, traps, environment interaction, and enemy behavior. He noted that both <a href="David%20Jaffe">David Jaffe</a> and <a href="Cory%20Barlog">Cory Barlog</a> (game directors of "God of War" and "God of War II", respectively) ensured the "Betrayal" development team captured the feel of the combat and visual style, and were "helpful with feedback and positive support". The team also worked closely with Eric Williams, the console game's lead combat designer. In keeping the "look and feel" true to the franchise, the development team played "God of War" extensively to study the pacing and tricks in the console releases. The development team also worked closely with <a href="Marianne%20Krawczyk">Marianne Krawczyk</a>, the writer of the "God of War" console games. Krawczyk used "Betrayal" to bridge the events between "God of War" and "God of War II", include additional backstory, and to explain why the relationship between the gods and Kratos had changed.

"Betrayal" received mixed-to-positive reception, including praise for its fidelity to the series in terms of gameplay, art style, and graphics. Levi Buchanan of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> called it "the real deal third game in the killer franchise". Similarly, Matt Paprocki of <a href="Blogcritics">Blogcritics</a> wrote, ""Betrayal" is a full-fledged extension of the "God of War" franchise, and it earns its title". He said it is "one of the best mobile games you’ll ever play, and has truly made the format a relevant part of the current video game scene." In regards to violence, Chris Antista of <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> stated that it is "quite possibly the goriest thing your mobile's ever seen". Although not a "revolutionary experience", "<a href="Pocket%20Gamer">Pocket Gamer</a>"s Will Freeman said "it is a thoroughly impressive, utterly solid release that mobile platform fans will relish." Modojo's Justin Davis said that while "Betrayal" is compelling enough to play all the way to the end, "[it did not] feel like I was having fun."

The context-sensitive attacks received praise and criticism. Antista said, "[the thing] fans will be thankful for is the triumphant return of the contextual attacks", but added that the control limitations were the "only real problem", as the sensitivity of the cursor button can result in a failed combo, "And the jump button sends you forward in the direction you're facing automatically." Buchanan noted that the contextual attacks "can prove frustratingly tricky as you have a brief amount of time to input the commands, but the controls on most handsets are quite small".

Commenting on the combat, Paprocki said that despite the simplified combo system, the developers have "managed to infuse the sheer brutality and force "God of War" is known for within the confines of the [mobile] platform." Because of the simplified system, situations which call for Kratos' magical abilities are rare. However, if players do choose to use these abilities, selecting them is a "burden in the haste of a battle", requiring players to cycle through their entire inventory. Paprocki also criticized the lack of an <a href="autosave">autosave</a> feature, as the game does not save the player's position when receiving a phone call, which "can lead to unbearable frustration." Freeman said that the combination of the weapons and <a href="quick%20time%20event">quick time event</a>s make the combat "a convincing interpretation of the action in the original console games". Davis said that although there are puzzle and platforming elements, the focus is "clearly on the combat" and felt that the combat system was "a little shallow". He said it seems as if the abundance of enemies "exist solely to act as punching (or slicing, as it were) bags for Kratos".

IGN named "Betrayal" "Wireless Game of the Month" for June 2007. In their Best of 2007 – Wireless Awards, they named it the "Best Platform Game".

William Cooley (1783–1863) was one of the first American <a href="settler">settler</a>s, and a regional leader, in what is now known as <a href="Broward%20County%2C%20Florida">Broward County</a> in the state of <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. His family was killed by <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a>s in 1836, during the <a href="Second%20Seminole%20War">Second Seminole War</a>. The attack, known as the "New River Massacre", caused immediate abandonment of the area by whites.

Cooley was born in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, but little else is known about his life prior to 1813, when he arrived in <a href="East%20Florida">East Florida</a>, a province of <a href="Spanish%20Florida">Spanish Florida</a>, as part of a military expedition. He established himself as a farmer in the northern part of the province before moving south, where he traded with local <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indians</a> and continued to farm. During the period in which the region was transferred from Spanish to <a href="Florida%20Territory">U.S. governance</a>, he sided with natives in a land dispute against a merchant who had received a large grant from the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Spain%23Bourbon%20Monarchy">King of Spain</a> and was evicting the Indians from their lands. Unhappy with the actions of the Spanish, he moved to the <a href="New%20River%20%28Broward%20County%2C%20Florida%29">New River</a> area in 1826 to get as far as possible from the Spanish influence.

In New River, Cooley sustained himself as a salvager and farmer, cultivating and milling <a href="Zamia%20integrifolia">arrowroot</a>. His fortune and influence grew: he became the first lawman and judge in the settlement, besides being a land appraiser. Local Indians held him responsible for what they saw as a misjudgment involving the murder of one of their chiefs, and attacked the settlement in revenge on January 4, 1836.

Cooley survived the attack and lived for a further . He held administrative positions in <a href="Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Dade County</a>, moved to <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a> in 1837, and had a short stint working for the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> as a guide and courier. He moved to the <a href="Homosassa%20Springs%20Wildlife%20State%20Park">Homosassa River</a> area in 1840, where he became the first postmaster and was a <a href="Hernando%20County%2C%20Florida">Hernando County</a> candidate for the <a href="Florida%20House%20of%20Representatives">Florida House of Representatives</a>. Returning to Tampa in 1847, he was one of the first city councilors, serving before he died in 1863.

Cooley was born in Maryland in 1783; little else is known about him prior to 1813. Cooley has been referred to as William Cooley Jr., William Coolie, William Colee and William Cooly.

Cooley arrived in <a href="East%20Florida">East Florida</a> in 1813, during a joint campaign of <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> and <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> forces. Some sources give credit to the hypothesis that Cooley fought with the Tennessee Volunteers under <a href="John%20Williams%20%28Tennessee%29">Colonel John Williams</a>; other sources say he was a lieutenant in the <a href="Georgia%20Militia">Georgia Militia</a>, fighting under Colonel Samuel Alexander from Georgia. Cooley acquired property in Girt's Landing on the <a href="St.%20Marys%20River%20%28Florida/Georgia%29">St. Marys River</a>, close to where the military units crossed East Florida that same year. Later, he went to the west bank of the <a href="St.%20Johns%20River">St. Johns River</a>, settling in an area south of modern <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville</a>.

Cooley later moved to Alligator Pond (near present-day <a href="Lake%20City%2C%20Florida">Lake City</a>), where he set up a farm and traded with the local <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a> tribe led by Chief <a href="Micanopy">Micanopy</a>. The territory of East Florida was formally transferred from Spain to the United States in 1821, under the terms of the 1819 <a href="Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs%20Treaty">Adams–Onís Treaty</a>. In 1820, Spanish merchant Don Fernando de la Maza Arredondo began settlement of a claim in the <a href="Alachua%20County%2C%20Florida">Alachua territory</a>, which had been granted to him by <a href="Ferdinand%20VII%20of%20Spain">King Ferdinand VII of Spain</a>. Cooley negotiated with Don Fernando on behalf of the displaced Indians but was unsuccessful. Cooley moved away in 1823—possibly to escape the Spanish influence—to the north bank of the <a href="New%20River%20%28Broward%20County%2C%20Florida%29">New River</a>.

Like the other New River settlers, Cooley did not buy land; he simply occupied the land in hope that the United States would eventually survey the area and grant ownership to the present settlers. The settlement was primarily populated by <a href="Bahamas">Bahamians</a>, who survived by <a href="turtling%20%28hunting%29">turtling</a>, fishing, <a href="shipbuilding">shipbuilding</a> and <a href="wrecking%20%28shipwreck%29">wrecking</a>.

In 1830, Bahamian Frankee Lewis, who in 1788 had been one of the area's first settlers, sold her business interests to Richard Fitzpatrick. After Fitzpatrick's arrival, the settlement of approximately prospered with the introduction of a <a href="plantation%20%28settlement%20or%20colony%29">plantation</a> regimen based on <a href="Slavery%20in%20Colonial%20America%23The%20first%20African%20slaves">black slavery</a>.

Cooley's main occupation was gathering, processing and shipping <a href="Florida%20arrowroot">Florida arrowroot</a>, a starch made from the root of the <a href="Zamia%20integrifolia">coontie</a> plant. Arrowroot was used to make bread dough, wafers and biscuits; its resistance to spoilage made it especially favored for use on ships. Pulp remaining after processing was used as a fertilizer or for animal feed. Favorable conditions for arrowroot cultivation contributed to the presence of several hundred Indians in the area—arrowroot being a staple of their diet. The market price for the starch was (between 17¢ and 35¢ per kg), and the geography of the river and the good performance of his machinery—the output was close to —brought Cooley great prosperity. His good fortune allowed him to dedicate much of his time to exploration of the area as far north as <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a> and brought him increasing political influence. It is likely that he married Nancy Dayton, a former Indian captive, on December 2, 1830.
Richard Fitzpatrick, by that time the owner of a successful plantation with coconut and lime trees, <a href="plantain%20%28cooking%29">plantain</a>s, and <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a>, pressed for the appointment of Cooley as <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> in 1831, making Cooley responsible for adjudicating disputes of persons and property, punishment of minor offenders by fines and whippings, and oversight of the activities of wreckers. Serious offenders were jailed in <a href="Key%20West">Key West</a>. By that time, Cooley owned a <a href="schooner">schooner</a> and took trips not only to take prisoners but to trade coontie, sugarcane, and tropical fruit with <a href="Cape%20Florida%20Light">Cape Florida</a>, <a href="Indian%20Key">Indian Key</a>, Key West and <a href="Havana">Havana</a>.

While trade and farming activities were prominent, wrecking was the most important economic activity in the settlement. Northern newspapers started a campaign against wrecking in 1832, claiming that the activity was just a disguise for piracy; the underscored their claim. Cooley, already in charge of overseeing wrecking, received a territorial appointment as <a href="appraiser">appraiser</a> of the sunk vessels and their cargoes. The strength of <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">hurricane seasons</a> affected the activity, and the especially active <a href="1830-1839%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20seasons%231835%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1835 season</a> brought even bigger profits.

By 1835, Cooley had two sons and one daughter. The boys were named Almonock and Montezuma, after two local Indian chiefs. His ten-year-old daughter and his nine-year-old son were tutored by the couple Mary E. Rigby and Joseph Flinton.

Cooley was appointed as an appraiser of property and <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a> for Union Bank of Florida. His ally, Richard Fitzpatrick, purchased his coontie and <a href="citrus">citrus</a> plantation on the Miami River for $2,500. Subsequently, Fitzpatrick was elected as representative for <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Florida">Monroe County</a> to the <a href="Florida%20Legislature">Territorial Legislative Council</a>. The unanimous vote for Fitzpatrick in New River was questioned by the "Key West Inquirer". Cooley's conduct was implicitly questioned as well, since as Justice of the Peace, Cooley conducted the non-secret balloting. In Key West, Fitzpatrick lost to William Hackley.

The Cooley property in New River had a house that was "twenty feet by fifty feet [6 by 15 m], one story high, built of <a href="cypress">cypress</a> logs, sealed and floored with 1-1/2 inch [4 cm] planks". At least three black slaves and several Indians cultivated sugar cane, corn, potatoes, pumpkins and other vegetables on the twenty-acre (eight-hectare) property, which also had a pen with eighty <a href="pig%20farming">hogs</a>. The coontie <a href="watermill">watermill</a> was twenty-seven by fourteen feet . Cooley's Key West holdings included a factory, two storage houses, kitchen and slave quarters; <a href="coconut">coconut</a>, <a href="lime%20%28fruit%29">lime</a> and orange trees; and domesticated and wild fowl.

Cooley maintained friendly relations and trade with the Seminole Indians in the area. In the early nineteenth century, <a href="Creek%20people">Creek Indians</a> had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after a hearing at the <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Florida">Monroe County</a> Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.

<a href="Francis%20L.%20Dade">Major Francis L. Dade</a>, military commandant at Key West, received intelligence that <a href="Captaincy%20General%20of%20Cuba">Cuba</a> and Spain were arming the Indians; investigations did not confirm the rumor. Reports coming from <a href="Fort%20Brooke">Fort Brooke</a>, near present-day <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a>, noted that Indians in the area were resisting orders from the federal government to emigrate to <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, contradicting the assertions made by the federal authorities that the Indians had agreed to emigrate peacefully. Dade, two companies of soldiers, and all of the available arms were sent to Fort Brooke at <a href="Tampa%20Bay">Tampa Bay</a>, the port designated for the commencement of the Indians' emigration. The Indians answered by concentrating all of their forces in the New River region. On December 28, 1835, Dade and 107 soldiers were ambushed en route from Tampa Bay to <a href="Fort%20King">Fort King</a>, near present-day <a href="Ocala%2C%20Florida">Ocala</a>. Only three soldiers survived; the attackers lost only three men.

Six days later, Cooley led a large expedition to free the "Gil Blas", a ship that had beached the previous year. The scale of the operation required all of the settlement's able men. On the next day, January 4, 1836, the Indians attacked the settlement.

Between fifteen and twenty Indians invaded the Cooley house, overpowering the tutor and <a href="scalping">scalping</a> him. Cooley's wife grabbed their infant son and tried to run to the river, but was shot about from the house. The shot killed her and the baby. Cooley's nine-year-old son died from a fractured skull, and his daughter was shot. Two of Cooley's black slaves disappeared.

The tutor's son heard the screams by the river and came back to retrieve his mother and two younger sisters. He managed to escape, going south by boat to the <a href="Cape%20Florida%20Light">Cape Florida Light</a>house. Along the way, he warned the people at <a href="Arch%20Creek%2C%20Florida">Arch Creek</a> and <a href="Miami%20River%20%28Florida%29">Miami River</a> of the attack, prompting them to flee as well.

After the attack, the Indians torched the house and left without attacking other dwellings. The next day, Cooley came back to bury the dead; it is unclear who alerted the salvager's team to the attack. After staying at the settlement for three days, Cooley went to the <a href="Cape%20Florida%20Light">Cape Florida Light</a>house. One of the missing slaves appeared, reporting that he recognized the assailants as having been acquaintances of the Cooley family. The slave had heard the Indians ascribing the massacre to an act of revenge for Cooley's having failed to obtain the conviction of Chief Alibama's murderers.

Cooley took charge of the lighthouse encampment. Richard Fitzpatrick sent sixty slaves from his Miami plantation to the lighthouse. Fearing more attacks and aware of the precarious safety of the lighthouse, the settlers and slaves boarded Cooley's schooner and smaller boats and escaped to <a href="Indian%20Key">Indian Key</a>, north of Key West. Judge Marvin, a Key West justice, accused Seminole (or <a href="Calusa">Calusa</a>, depending on the source) chief Chakaika of leading the New River Settlement raiding group. This was not proved, but it is known that Chakaika was an important leader who coordinated the devastating attack on Indian Key in 1840.

When Cooley arrived at Indian Key, he was informed that Indians had attempted to acquire arms and munition but had been repelled by the garrison in the island's fort. Meanwhile, more than from nearby sought refuge in the fort. Cannons were salvaged from the "Gil Blas"; the ship was later burned to deny the Indians a chance to recover anything from it. Difficult sea conditions and fear of imminent attacks terrorized the islanders. Cooley asked for construction of forts at New River and <a href="Cape%20Sable">Cape Sable</a>, but news soon came from the <a href="Miami%20River%20%28Florida%29">Miami River</a> reporting the total destruction of all white property, stalling all new initiatives.

Cooley went back to New River and discovered the Indians had returned to loot the settlement and had burned several other houses and plantations. A claim for restitution of his losses was denied in 1840 by the <a href="26th%20United%20States%20Congress">United States House of Representatives</a>. Arriving at Key West on January 16, 1836, aboard the steamboat "Champion", he was appointed temporary lighthouse keeper, staying until April of that year.

Cooley resumed his life as a wrecker. Later that same year, he worked again as justice of the peace and assumed a position as a legislatively-appointed auctioneer.

Constant attacks and rumor-spreading amplified the demands of Floridian community leaders, forcing the Navy to send Lieutenant Levin M. Powell to Key West. Lieutenant Powell built a small force of , , and , reinforced by and the United States Revenue Cutter
"<a href="USRC%20Washington%20%281833%29">Washington</a>", commanded by Captain Day. Powell called Cooley to be his guide in the enterprise because of his knowledge of Indian leaders and customs. Powell had mixed success, although by December 1836 the situation was under control at the coasts. Cooley went back to his usual duties in Indian Key (<a href="Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Dade County</a> Seat); not long after, he moved to Tampa but still worked occasionally as a guide.

General <a href="Thomas%20Jesup">Thomas Jesup</a>, headquartered in Fort Dade, made Cooley an express rider in early 1837 to deliver messages between Tampa Bay and <a href="Middleburg%2C%20Florida%23History">Fort Heilman</a>, a corridor of . That same year, reports circulated that Cooley was spreading rumors about a Seminole chief leading a rebellion involving black slaves and Indians. Afraid that Cooley could be directly involved, the general had him interrogated. Afterwards, a disgusted Cooley resigned his position.

Cooley befriended Captain William Bunce, a retailer striving to keep Indians in the area, as they represented a source of cheap labor. He became involved again in local politics, this time against General Jesup, who wanted to remove all Indians from Florida. Judge Steele, a newcomer from Connecticut, was Cooley's ally in this fight.

By 1840, he lived in <a href="Leon%20County%2C%20Florida">Leon County</a>, with a single slave. Cooley was living near the <a href="Homosassa%20Springs%20Wildlife%20State%20Park">Homosassa River</a>, where the <a href="Armed%20Occupation%20Act">Armed Occupation Act</a> of 1842 allowed the distribution of land grants. His leadership enabled him to get not only his own permit but permits for . A lengthy correspondence with the <a href="General%20Land%20Office">General Land Office</a> was eventually concluded satisfactorily for him and the other settlers. In 1843, he was a candidate for a seat in the <a href="Florida%20House%20of%20Representatives">Florida House of Representatives</a> for the newly created <a href="Hernando%20County%2C%20Florida">Hernando County</a>, but he lost to James Gibbons. Two years later, he became the first postmaster in Homosassa and County Commissioner of Fisheries. He sold his land grant to Senator <a href="David%20Levy%20Yulee">David Levy Yulee</a> sequentially between 1846 and 1847 and moved back to Tampa.

From 1848 to 1860, Cooley acquired several properties in the Tampa region, including one at <a href="Safety%20Harbor%2C%20Florida%23Early%20history">Worth's Harbor</a>. By 1850, he lived with seven slaves and was a <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">Captain</a> of the "Silver Grays"—a <a href="militia">militia</a> for the home defense of Tampa in the 1850s. He owned a <a href="general%20store">general store</a> in the city, eventually sold to a member of the <a href="Masonic%20Temple%20No.%2025">Tampa Masonic Lodge</a>. He was nominated Port Warden of Tampa in 1853. By 1855, Cooley had become a leader in local politics; he was the chairman at a meeting of the <a href="Florida%20Democratic%20Party">Democratic Party</a> in Tampa, with members enrolled, on August 4, 1855. He was brought in as an alternate councilman for two months in the first Tampa council, served a full-year term beginning in February 1857, and returned in 1861 for another full term. Cooley estimated his personal wealth at $10,060 in 1860.

Cooley died in 1863 in <a href="Hillsborough%20County%2C%20Florida">Hillsborough County, Florida</a>. His <a href="will%20%28law%29">will</a> was written in 1862 but recorded only after Cooley's death, filed by Francis Matthews, who identified himself as his son-in-law. In the document, Cooley is referred to as William "Cooly". Cooley left his estate to friends, charities, a woman called Fanny Anne listed as his daughter (wife of Francis Matthews), and three grandsons and four granddaughters, but there is no evidence that they were his blood relatives. Colee Hammock Park in Fort Lauderdale is located near the site of his old home in the New River Settlement.

SMS "Kaiser Friedrich III" ("His Majesty's Ship "Emperor Frederick III"") was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of the of <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s. She was laid down at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> in March 1895, <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> in July 1896, and finished in October 1898. The ship was armed with a main battery of four guns in two twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s supported by a <a href="secondary%20battery">secondary battery</a> of eighteen guns.

<a href="Sea%20trials">Sea trials</a> and modifications lasted more than a year, and once she entered active service in October 1899, the ship became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281862-1929%29">Prince Heinrich</a> in the I Squadron of the German "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet). The I Squadron was primarily occupied with training exercises throughout each year, and also made numerous trips to other European countries, particularly Great Britain and <a href="Sweden%E2%80%93Norway">Sweden–Norway</a>. In 1901, the ship was severely damaged after striking submerged rocks in the Baltic; the incident contributed to design changes in later German battleships to make them more resistant to underwater damage.

"Kaiser Friedrich III" was extensively modernized in 1908; her secondary guns were reorganized and her <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> was cut down to reduce top-heaviness. After returning to service in 1910, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was placed in the Reserve Formation; she spent the next two years <a href="%3Awikt%3Alaid%20up">laid up</a>, being activated only for the annual fleet maneuvers. The years 1913 and 1914 passed without any active service until the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in July 1914. Though obsolete, "Kaiser Friedrich III" and her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s served in a limited capacity as <a href="Coastal%20defence%20ship">coastal defense ships</a> in the V Battle Squadron in the early months of the war, tasked with defending Germany's <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> coastline. The ships conducted two operations in the Baltic but did not encounter any hostile warships. By February 1915, "Kaiser Friedrich" was withdrawn from service and eventually decommissioned in November, thereafter being employed as a <a href="prison%20ship">prison ship</a> and later as a <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a>. She was scrapped in 1920.

After the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The former Secretary of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office), <a href="Leo%20von%20Caprivi">Leo von Caprivi</a> became the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor of Germany</a> in 1890, and "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hollmann">Friedrich von Hollmann</a> became the new Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt". Hollmann requested a new battleship in 1892 to replace the elderly <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad turret-ship</a> , built twenty years earlier, but the <a href="Franco-Russian%20Alliance">Franco-Russian Alliance</a>, signed the year before, put the government's attention on expanding the Army's budget. Parliamentary opposition forced Hollmann to delay until the following year, when Caprivi spoke in favor of the project, noting that Russia's recent naval expansion threatened Germany's <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> coastline. In late 1893, Hollmann presented the Navy's estimates for the 1894–1895 budget year, again with a request for a replacement for "Preussen", which was approved. The new ship abandoned the six-gun arrangement of the "Brandenburg"s for four large-caliber pieces, the standard arrangement of other navies at the time.

"Kaiser Friedrich III" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward and aft. She displaced normally and up to at full load. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple-expansion%20engine">triple-expansion</a> <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a>s that drove three screw propellers. Steam was provided by four Marine-type and eight <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">cylindrical boilers</a>, all of which burned coal. "Kaiser Friedrich III"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . The ship had a crew that ranged from 658 to 687 officers and enlisted men.

The ship's armament consisted of a main battery of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40 guns</a> and twelve <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns</a>. She also carried twelve 1-pounder <a href="3.7%20cm%20Maxim%20machine%20cannon">machine guns</a>, but these were later removed. The armament suite was rounded out with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all in above-water swivel mounts. The ship's <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was thick, and the deck was thick. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> and main battery turrets were protected with of armor plating, and the secondary casemates received 150 mm of armor protection.

"Kaiser Friedrich III"s <a href="keel">keel</a> was <a href="keel%20laying">laid</a> on 5 March 1895, at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> (Imperial Shipyard) in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>, under <a href="yard%20number">construction number</a> 22. <a href="German%20Emperor">Kaiser</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a>, the son of <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor">the ship's namesake</a>, hammered the first <a href="rivet">rivet</a> into the keel. She was ordered under the contract name "Ersatz Preussen", to replace the elderly <a href="armored%20frigate">armored frigate</a> "Preussen". "Kaiser Friedrich III" was <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 1 July 1896 and Wilhelm II was again present, this time to give the launching speech. The ship was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 7 October 1898 and began <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a> in the Baltic Sea. Of major concern was how the three-shaft arrangement would perform on a ship the size of "Kaiser Friedrich III"; the preceding "Brandenburg" class had used two shafts. After the trials were completed in mid-February 1899, "Kaiser Friedrich" returned to Wilhelmshaven and was decommissioned so defects identified during the trials could be remedied. The work lasted longer than originally planned, and the ship remained out of service for much of the year.

Upon recommissioning on 21 October, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was assigned to the II Division of the I Squadron of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet), which was commanded by "Vizeadmiral" <a href="Paul%20Hoffmann%20%28naval%20officer%29">Paul Hoffmann</a>. She took the place of the ironclad , which had been decommissioned the previous day. "Kaiser Friedrich III" became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the II Division, commanded by "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" (Rear Admiral) <a href="Wilhelm%20B%C3%BCchsel">Wilhelm Büchsel</a>. Before she could actually join her division, "Kaiser Friedrich III" and the <a href="aviso">aviso</a> were sent to escort the Kaiser's yacht <a href="SMY%20Hohenzollern">"Hohenzollern</a> on a trip to Britain for the Kaiser to visit his grandmother, <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. The ships left Germany on 17 November and stayed in <a href="Dover">Dover</a> from 18 to 20 November, before proceeding to <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> on the 20th, remaining there for three days. On their return they stopped in <a href="Vlissingen">Vlissingen</a> in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, from 24 to 29 November, before continuing on to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>, where they arrived on 1 December.

"Kaiser Friedrich II" finally assumed her role as the II Division flagship on 24 January 1900, when Büchsel transferred his flag to the ship. On 2 April, the I Squadron steamed to <a href="Danzig%20Bay">Danzig Bay</a>, where they stayed for four days. The next month, they began a cruise into the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> on 7 May; during the trip, the ships made stops in <a href="Lerwick">Lerwick</a> in the Shetland Islands from 12 to 15 May and <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a>, Norway, from 18 to 22 May. They arrived back in Kiel four days after leaving Bergen. In early July, the four "Brandenburg"-class battleships were sent to Asia to suppress the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>, prompting a reorganization of the "Heimatflotte". "Kaiser Friedrich III" and were the only battleships available for the annual fleet maneuvers, which were conducted from 15 August to 15 September. They were joined by the armored frigates and and six and s. Throughout the maneuvers, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was assigned to the "German" force, which had to combat a hostile "Yellow" <a href="Squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a>. Thereafter, Büchsel became the deputy commander of the I Squadron, but he remained aboard "Kaiser Friedrich III" only briefly before transferring his flag to the ironclad "Württemberg". "Konteradmiral" <a href="Max%20von%20Fischel">Max von Fischel</a> replaced him on 30 September, but "Kaiser Friedrich III" went into <a href="drydock">drydock</a> for her annual overhaul shortly thereafter.

On 1 November, "Vizeadmiral" <a href="Prince%20Heinrich">Prince Heinrich</a>, who had replaced Hoffmann as the I Squadron commander, raised his flag aboard "Kaiser Friedrich III"; the ship held the role as squadron flagship for the next three years, interrupted only during the annual fleet exercises conducted in August and September, when Admiral <a href="Hans%20von%20Koester">Hans von Koester</a>, the "<a href="Generalinspekteur%20der%20Marine">Generalinspekteur der Marine</a>" (Inspector-General of the Navy), commanded the fleet from "Kaiser Wilhelm II". Through November, the ships of the squadron were occupied with individual training. On 17 November 1900, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was steaming to Kiel after conducting training exercises. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" attempted to pass "Kaiser Friedrich III", so the latter stopped and allowed the former to pass to port. However, the order to resume steaming was given too quickly, and the ship accidentally <a href="ramming">rammed</a> "Kaiser Wilhelm II". "Kaiser Friedrich III" suffered minor damage to her bow, while her sister was slightly damaged in the compartment that housed the steering engines. Repairs were completed within three days, without the need for either vessel to enter drydock. On 4 December, the ships began a winter training cruise, during which they stopped in <a href="Larvik">Larvik</a>, Norway, from 10 to 12 December. The squadron returned to Germany three days later.

In early 1901 the ships underwent periodic maintenance. The repairs were completed by mid-March, at which time the members of the squadron reunited in Kiel. They then began a training cruise into the Baltic Sea, stopping in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> on 1 April. There, Koester informed Prince Heinrich about upcoming joint Army-Navy maneuvers. While returning to Kiel on the night of 1–2 April, "Kaiser Friedrich III" struck an uncharted rock off <a href="Kap%20Arkona">Kap Arkona</a> just north of the <a href="Adlergrund">Adlergrund</a> at around 01:27. The rock tore a gaping hole in the starboard side of the hull and damaged four of the ship's <a href="watertight%20compartment">watertight compartment</a>s, which filled with water and caused the ship to list to port. Eventually, some of water entered the ship. The shock from the collision damaged the ship's boilers and started a fire in the coal bunkers, which spread to the starboard aft <a href="boiler%20room%20%28ship%29">boiler room</a>, forcing the crew to shut down the ship's engines. All of the ship's ammunition magazines, engine rooms, and storage compartments had to be flooded to prevent the fire from spreading. Three men were seriously injured while fighting the fire, one of which died of his injuries.

The crew were able to suppress the fire and contain the flooding. "Kaiser Wilhelm II", which had also had a slight <a href="Ship%20grounding">grounding</a> (without damage), came alongside to take off the crew if it became necessary to abandon the ship and, once the fires were controlled, attempted to take "Kaiser Friedrich III" under tow, but the cables snapped. By this time, the crew got steam up in the remaining boilers, and the ship proceeded at a speed of . to Kiel, which she reached on 3 April. There, the ship was thoroughly examined. The dockyard workers found that eight of the ship's boilers had been badly damaged, and many bulkheads had been bent from the pressure of the water. The keel was extensively damaged, with large holes torn in several places. All three of the ship's propellers were damaged as well. Temporary repairs were effected in Kiel, which included sealing the holes with cement and wood. On 23 April, this work was completed and she left for Wilhelmshaven, where she was decommissioned for permanent repairs on 4 May.

A subsequent investigation found that the nearby <a href="Lightvessel">lightship</a>—which was used to navigate the channel at night—was from its assigned location, and there were several uncharted rocks in the area of the accident. Therefore, the investigation concluded that the ship's command staff was not at fault in the accident. The investigators also recommended design changes to the s, then still being designed.

While "Kaiser Friedrich III" was decommissioned for repairs, her crew was transferred to her new sister . The work was completed by early November, and on the 11th, the ship was recommissioned. Both her crew and Prince Heinrich returned from "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse". Divisional exercises followed through the rest of November, and on 2 December, the I Squadron began another winter training cruise into the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> and <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a>. From 7 to 12 December, the ships stopped in <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, Norway, where <a href="Oscar%20II%20of%20Sweden">Oscar II</a> visited "Kaiser Friedrich III". The ships returned to Kiel on 15 December.

The year 1902 began with the same routine of training operations as in previous years for the ships of the I Squadron. The last ironclad finally left the squadron in February, having been replaced by "Kaiser Friedrich III"s newly commissioned sister ship . The squadron began a major training cruise on 25 April; that day, while the ships were passing through the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a>, a serious boiler accident occurred aboard "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse", forcing her to turn back for repairs. "Kaiser Friedrich III" and the rest of the squadron continued into the North Sea, toward Scotland. They passed through the <a href="Pentland%20Firth">Pentland Firth</a> on 29 April before turning south toward Ireland. The ships stopped briefly in <a href="Lough%20Swilly">Lough Swilly</a> on 1 May before proceeding to <a href="Bantry%20Bay">Bantry Bay</a>, where they anchored off <a href="Berehaven">Berehaven</a> five days later. There, Prince Heinrich visited his British cousin, <a href="Prince%20Arthur%2C%20Duke%20of%20Connaught%20and%20Strathearn">Prince Arthur</a>, and the ships were received by the British <a href="Channel%20Squadron">Channel Squadron</a>. The German vessels then steamed to <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, and then to the <a href="Isles%20of%20Scilly">Isles of Scilly</a>, where "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" rejoined the squadron. They returned to Dublin, where they were visited by <a href="Gerald%20Cadogan%2C%206th%20Earl%20Cadogan">Gerald Cadogan</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland">Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</a>. The ships finally began their return voyage to Germany on 24 May, and reached Kiel four days later.

For most of June, the ships of the squadron conducted individual training. "Vizeadmiral" <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>, the State Secretary of the <a href="German%20Imperial%20Naval%20Office">Imperial Naval Office</a>, brought the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> budget committee to view the I Squadron in an attempt to convince them of the value of continued naval expansion. Toward the end of the month, "Kaiser Friedrich III" departed for Britain with Prince Heinrich to represent Germany during the coronation of King <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>. The ceremony was delayed, however, and "Kaiser Friedrich III" returned to Kiel on 30 June. The I Squadron began a training cruise to Norwegian waters on 8 July that ended on 20 July. During the annual gunnery training held after the ships' return to Kiel, "Kaiser Friedrich III" won the Kaiser's "Schießpreis" (Shooting Prize) for excellence in gunnery. On 17 August, the fleet assembled in Kiel for the annual training maneuvers. Assigned to the "hostile" force, "Kaiser Friedrich III" patrolled the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a> in the Baltic to prevent the "German" squadron from passing through. "Kaiser Friedrich III" and several other battleships then forced an entry into the mouth of the <a href="Elbe%20River">Elbe River</a>, where the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a> and <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> could be seized. The "hostile" flotilla accomplished these tasks within three days.

Starting in November, the I Squadron—less the "Wittelsbach"-class ships, which were still occupied with trials—conducted a number of short cruises, culminating in the annual winter cruise that began on 1 December. The ships steamed into the Kattegat and stopped in <a href="Frederikshavn">Frederikshavn</a>, Denmark, before continuing on to Bergen, where they stayed from 6 to 10 December. "Kaiser Friedrich III" and the rest of the squadron returned to Kiel, arriving two days later. On 2 April 1903, the squadron went to sea again, and began gunnery training two days later. These exercises continued for the rest of the month, interrupted only by heavy storms. A major training cruise followed the next month; on 10 May the ships departed the <a href="Elbe%20river">Elbe river</a> and made their way into the <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a>. They cruised south to Spain, passing <a href="Ushant">Ushant</a> on 14 May and reaching the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> five days later. There, they conducted a reconnaissance exercise off <a href="Pontevedra">Pontevedra</a> before anchoring in <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a> on 20 May. Prince Heinrich left "Kaiser Friedrich III" for a visit to <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>. After he returned, the squadron departed Spain on 30 May. The ships passed through the <a href="Strait%20of%20Dover">Strait of Dover</a> on 3 June and continued into the Kattegat. There, they rendezvoused with the <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s of the I "Torpedobootsflotille" (Torpedo Boat Flotilla)—commanded by "<a href="Korvettenkapit%C3%A4n">Korvettenkapitän</a>" (Lieutenant Commander) <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>—for a mock attack on the fortifications at Kiel.

Later in June, the ships took part in additional gunnery training and were present at the <a href="Kiel%20Week">Kiel Week</a> sailing <a href="regatta">regatta</a>. During Kiel Week, an American squadron that included the battleship and four cruisers visited. Following the end of Kiel Week, the I Squadron, which had been strengthened with the new cruiser , and the I "Torpedobootsflotille" went to sea for more tactical and gunnery exercises in the North Sea, which lasted from 6 to 28 July. During the maneuvers, "Kaiser Friedrich III" collided with the torpedo boat . One man aboard "G112" was killed in the accident, but the boat remained afloat and was towed to Wilhelmshaven. "Kaiser Friedrich III" sustained only minor damage. At the conclusion of the exercises, the I Squadron stopped in <a href="Arendal">Arendal</a> from 24 to 27 July, while the smaller vessels went to <a href="Stavanger">Stavanger</a>. The ships returned to Kiel on 28 July, where preparations for the annual fleet maneuvers began, which started on 15 August. After the conclusion of the exercises, the "Heimatflotte" was reorganized as the "Aktive Schlachtflotte" (Active Battle Fleet), and Koester replaced Prince Heinrich as the fleet commander; he transferred his flag from "Kaiser Friedrich III" to "Kaiser Wilhelm II".

For "Kaiser Friedrich III", 1904 continued in the same pattern as previous years. The ship took part in a training cruise to Britain that included squadron exercises in the northern North Sea and along the Norwegian coast. During the cruise, the ship stopped in <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, Vlissingen, Lerwick, and <a href="Molde">Molde</a>. The annual autumn fleet maneuvers, conducted from 29 August to 15 September, passed uneventfully for "Kaiser Friedrich III". On 1 October, she was transferred to the II Squadron, where she served as the flagship. She had informally served in this role since 17 September, as the previous flagship, the coastal defense ship , had been decommissioned. Fischel, by now promoted to "Vizeadmiral", raised his flag aboard the ship during her formal transfer to the squadron. The two squadrons of the fleet ended the year with the usual training cruise into the Baltic, which took place uneventfully. The first half of 1905 similarly passed without incident for "Kaiser Friedrich III". On 12 July, the fleet began its annual summer cruise to northern waters; the ships stopped in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a> from 20 to 24 July and <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> from 2 to 7 August. The trip ended two days later, and was followed by the autumn fleet maneuvers later that month. On 1 October, the position for the deputy commander of I Squadron was recreated, and "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" (Captain) <a href="Hugo%20von%20Pohl">Hugo von Pohl</a> was assigned to the role. "Kaiser Friedrich III" was transferred to serve as Pohl's flagship. In December, the fleet took its usual training cruise in the Baltic.
"Kaiser Friedrich III" followed the same routine of training exercises through 1906. During gunnery training that year, the ship won the "Schießpreis" for a second time. The summer cruise went to Norway, including stops in Molde from 20 to 26 July and Bergen from 27 July to 2 August. That year, the autumn fleet maneuvers lasted only a week, from 7 to 15 September. After the maneuvers ended, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" replaced "Kaiser Friedrich III" as the deputy commander's flagship, though she remained in the I Squadron. In December, the fleet took its winter cruise into the North Sea instead of the Baltic. The year 1907 was similarly uneventful; the ship took part in three major training exercises, the first from 8 May to 7 June, the second from 13 July to 10 August, and the third, the annual fleet maneuvers, from 26 August to 14 September. Directly after the end of the fleet maneuvers, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was decommissioned in the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> in Kiel, being replaced by her sister . While she was decommissioned, the ship underwent an extensive modernization that lasted until 1909. Four of her 15 cm guns were removed, though two 8.8 cm guns were added. All twelve machine guns were removed, as was the ship's stern-mounted torpedo tube. "Kaiser Friedrich III"s superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship's tendency to roll excessively, and her funnels were lengthened.

After completing the reconstruction, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was assigned to the Reserve Formation of the Baltic, spending most of the year out of service. She was reactivated for the annual fleet maneuvers in August and September 1910 with what had since been reorganized as the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">"Hochseeflotte"</a> (High Seas Fleet). The ship was recommissioned on 2 August and assigned to the <a href="III%20Battle%20Squadron">III Battle Squadron</a>, serving as the flagship of "Vizeadmiral" <a href="Max%20Rollmann">Max Rollmann</a>, who came aboard four days later. The squadron was disbanded after the maneuvers on 8 September, and "Kaiser Friedrich III" was decommissioned again on 15 September. The ship spent most of 1911 in reserve as well, being activated only for the annual fleet maneuvers. After recommissioning on 31 July, she briefly served as the flagship of the deputy commander of the III Squadron, "Konteradmiral" <a href="Heinrich%20Sa%C3%9F">Heinrich Saß</a>. The ships initially trained individually before joining the rest of the fleet on 17 August. The maneuvers lasted until 11 September, after which "Kaiser Friedrich III" was decommissioned yet again. This proved to be the last time the ship would be activated before the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in July 1914. She and her sister ships were removed from the Reserve Formation in May 1912, having been replaced by the "Wittelsbach"-class vessels.

At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, "Kaiser Friedrich III" and her sisters were brought back to active service and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron. "Kaiser Friedrich III" was commanded by "Käpitan zur See" <a href="Alfred%20Begas">Alfred Begas</a>. The V Squadron was tasked with providing coastal defense in the North Sea. The ships were deployed to the Baltic twice, from 19 to 26 September and 26 to 30 December 1914. For the first operation, the commander of naval forces in the Baltic, Prince Heinrich, initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on <a href="Windau">Windau</a>, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, the V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Kaiser Friedrich III" and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, where the landing force disembarked. The ships then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. For their second deployment to the Baltic, Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a> to attack Russian warships that might be in the area. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Pomerania">Bay of Pomerania</a> and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December, having failed to locate any Russian vessels.

The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from front-line service shortly thereafter in February 1915. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of "Kaiser Friedrich III" and her sisters. The ship had her crew reduced on 6 March in Kiel, where she was assigned as a harbor defense ship. The V Squadron staff came aboard the ship on 25 April, until Begas, by now promoted to "Konteradmiral", left for . On 20 November, "Kaiser Friedrich III" was decommissioned for the last time. "Kaiser Friedrich III" was disarmed and used as a floating prison stationed in Kiel after 1916. The guns taken from "Kaiser Friedrich III" and the rest of the ships of her class were emplaced in coastal batteries; eight guns were placed on the <a href="Mole%20%28architecture%29">mole</a> outside <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a> and four each were placed on the islands of <a href="Norderney">Norderney</a> and <a href="Sylt">Sylt</a>. The following year, the ship was moved to <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>, where she was used as a barracks; later that year she was again moved to <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>. "Kaiser Friedrich III" was stricken from the navy list on 6 December 1919 and subsequently sold to a <a href="ship%20breaking">ship breaking</a> firm based in Berlin. The ship was ultimately broken up at Kiel-Nordmole in 1920. Her bow ornament ("bugzier") is on display at the <a href="Military%20History%20Museum%20of%20the%20Bundeswehr">Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr</a> in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>.

Religious debates over the Harry Potter series

Religious debates over the "Harry Potter" series of books by <a href="J.%20K.%20Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> are based on claims that the novels contain <a href="occult">occult</a> or <a href="Satanism">Satanic</a> subtexts. A number of <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a>, <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>, and <a href="Orthodox%20Christianity">Orthodox</a> <a href="Christianity">Christians</a> have argued against the series, as have some <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia</a> and <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a> Muslims. Supporters of the series have said that the magic in "<a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a>" bears little resemblance to occultism, being more in the vein of <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>s such as "<a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a>" and "<a href="Snow%20White">Snow White</a>", or to the works of <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> and <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue, the "Harry Potter" novels go out of their way to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Deathly%20Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a>".

In the United States, calls for the books to be banned from schools have led to legal challenges often on the grounds that <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a> is a government-recognised religion and that to allow the books to be held in public schools violates the <a href="Separation%20of%20church%20and%20state%20in%20the%20United%20States">separation of church and state</a>. The Orthodox churches of <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> have also campaigned against the series, and some Catholic writers and officials have voiced a critical stance. The books have been banned from all schools in the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>. Religious responses to "Harry Potter" have not all been negative. "At least as much as they've been attacked from a theological point of view," notes Rowling, "[the books] have been lauded and taken into pulpit, and most interesting and satisfying for me, it's been by several different faiths."

Most of the criticism of "Harry Potter" is from fundamentalist <a href="evangelism">evangelical Christian</a> groups, who believe the series' depiction of witchcraft is dangerous to children. Paul Hetrick, spokesman for <a href="Focus%20on%20the%20Family">Focus on the Family</a>, an American Evangelical Christian group based in <a href="Colorado%20Springs%2C%20Colorado">Colorado Springs, Colorado</a>, outlined the reasons for his opposition to them: "[They contain] some powerful and valuable lessons about love and courage and the ultimate victory of good over evil; however, the positive messages are packaged in a medium – witchcraft – that is directly denounced in <a href="Bible">Scripture</a>." "Harry Potter" has been the subject of at least six <a href="book%20burning">book burning</a>s in the U.S. In 2002, <a href="Chick%20Publications%20Inc.">Chick Publications</a> produced a comic book tract titled "The Nervous Witch" that declared "the Potter books open a doorway that will put untold millions of kids into hell." In 2007 Jacqui Komschlies wrote an article in "<a href="Christianity%20Today">Christianity Today</a>" comparing "Harry Potter" to "<a href="rodenticide">rat poison</a> mixed with <a href="Orange%20soft%20drink">orange soda</a>," and said, "We're taking something deadly from our world and turning it into what some are calling 'merely a literary device.

A common belief among fundamentalist Christians is that "Harry Potter" promotes the religion of <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>, and so keeping the books in <a href="state%20school">public schools</a> violates the <a href="separation%20of%20church%20and%20state%20in%20the%20United%20States">separation of church and state in the United States</a>. In her response to <a href="Laura%20Mallory">Laura Mallory</a>'s court case, education attorney Victoria Sweeny said that if schools were to remove all books containing reference to <a href="witchcraft">witches</a>, they would have to ban "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>" and "<a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a>". <a href="Jeremiah%20Films">Jeremiah Films</a>, a Christian video company largely known for its "<a href="The%20Clinton%20Chronicles">Clinton Chronicles</a>" release, also released a <a href="DVD">DVD</a> entitled "Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged", which stated that "Harry's world says that drinking dead animal blood gives power, a satanic human sacrifice and Harry's powerful blood brings new life, <a href="spirit%20possession">demon possession</a> is not spiritually dangerous, and that passing through fire, contacting the dead, and conversing with ghosts, others in the spirit world, and more, is normal and acceptable."

In 2001, Evangelical journalist <a href="Richard%20Abanes">Richard Abanes</a>, who has written several books arguing against new religions and <a href="Mormonism">Mormonism</a>, published a <a href="polemic">polemic</a>al text that made similar allegations to the video: "Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick". Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between "Harry Potter" and the more overtly Christian works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question, 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that will enable them to replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' If you go to "<a href="The%20Chronicles%20of%20Narnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>" and "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" what you see in, story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can't replicate it. But if you go to something like "Harry Potter", you can find references to <a href="astrology">astrology</a>, <a href="clairvoyance">clairvoyance</a>, and <a href="numerology">numerology</a>. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it."

Abanes writes: "The classic passage dealing with divination, along with several other forms of occultism, is Deuteronomy 18:10-12:

There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these thing are an abomination unto the LORD.
"If this were the only passage dealing with occultism, it would be enough to forbid all of the practices found in the Harry Potter series. But there are numerous other verses to consider..."
The debate has inspired at least two satirical Internet <a href="urban%20legend">urban legend</a>s. In 2001, "<a href="The%20Onion">The Onion</a>", an American <a href="news%20satire">satirical newspaper</a>, published an article entitled "Harry Potter Sparks Rise in Satanism Among Children," which said that the "High Priest of Satanism" had described Harry Potter as "an absolute godsend to our cause." This article was copied into a chain letter and circulated among Christians as "proof" of their views. The following year the Canadian daily the "<a href="National%20Post">National Post</a>" released a similar spoof article in its satirical column "Post Morten", saying that "Rowling—or, as she shall henceforth be referred to and credited as, Mrs. J. K. Satan—said that as she sat in a coffee shop one grey day, wondering what to do with her empty, aimless life, it hit her, 'I'll give myself, body and soul, to the Dark Master. And in return, he will give me absurd wealth and power over the weak and pitiful of the world. And he did!'" This article was also copied into a chain letter and released as "truth" onto the web.

In 2009, Matt Latimer, a former speechwriter for US President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, claimed that during the Bush administration, "people in the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>" had denied Rowling the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> because the books "encourage witchcraft."

While some evangelical Christians consider "Harry Potter" related to Satanism, a poll in 2000 indicated that this position remains a minority view. Seven percent of Americans who have heard of the books have a negative view of them, with 52 percent having a positive opinion and the remaining 41 percent unsure. This compares with 33 percent of Americans who identify themselves as Evangelical and 39 percent who take the Bible literally.
In 2001 the Alamogordo Christ Community Church in New Mexico burned hundreds of copies of the Harry Potter books. Jack Brock, leader of the church, said the books were an abomination because they inspired children to study the occult. He and his followers admitted they have never read any of the books, and tossed in some <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> novels. Venezuelan scholar Fernando Baez, in a study of the history of censorship and book destruction commented, "There is more than one way to destroy a book, upon being denied a city permit to burn books, the Rev. Douglas Taylor in Lewiston, Maine, has held several annual gatherings at which he cuts the Potter books up with scissors."

Some evangelicals have supported the Potter books: evangelical author Connie Neal, in her books, "What's a Christian to Do with Harry Potter?", "The Gospel According to Harry Potter", and "Wizards, Wardrobes, and Wookiees: Navigating Good and Evil in Harry Potter, Narnia, and Star Wars", wrote that the books preach Christian values and can be used to educate children in Christian tenets. Mike Hertenstein of "<a href="Cornerstone%20%28magazine%29">Cornerstone</a>" magazine, in his article "Harry Potter vs the Muggles, Myth, Magic & Joy," uses the term '<a href="Muggle">Muggle</a>s,' used in the books to describe non-magical humans, to describe Christians without imagination. "<a href="Christianity%20Today">Christianity Today</a>" published an editorial in favour of the books in January 2000, calling the series a "Book of Virtues" and averring that although "<nowiki>m</nowiki>odern witchcraft is indeed an ensnaring, seductive false religion that we must protect our children from," this does not represent the Potter books, which have "wonderful examples of compassion, loyalty, courage, friendship, and even self-sacrifice." <a href="Methodism%23Italy">Italian Methodist</a> minister Peter Ciaccio analysed the relationship between J. K. Rowling's work and Christian theology, stating that the Harry Potter series is the positive outcome of the encounter of the Jewish-Christian tradition with other important features of the Western cultural heritage (namely Celtic, Nordic and Classical).

The <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> has taken no official position on the books, but various Catholics, including officials of the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Roman Curia</a>, the <a href="Catholic%20Church%20hierarchy">hierarchy</a>, and other official bodies have presented mixed views on the subject.

Beginning in 2001, Cardinal <a href="George%20Pell">George Pell</a>, <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Sydney">Archbishop of Sydney</a>, has occasionally written on the "Harry Potter" series in his regular <a href="column%20%28newspaper%29">column</a> in "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Telegraph%20%28Sydney%29">The Sunday Telegraph</a>". In his columns, he praised the books for displaying values that are "deeply compatible with Christianity." In his book "Be Not Afraid", Pell praised the books as having a "good dose of moral truth" and for being "a good yarn."

In 2003, Peter Fleetwood, a priest <a href="incardination%20and%20excardination">incardinated</a> in the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Liverpool">Archdiocese of Liverpool</a> at the time serving as an official of the <a href="Pontifical%20Council%20for%20Culture">Pontifical Council for Culture</a>, made comments supportive of the novels during a press conference announcing the release of "Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of Life—A Christian reflection on the "New Age"". In response to a question asking if the magic presented in the "Harry Potter" series should be considered in the same light as some <a href="New%20Age">New Age</a> practices warned against in the document, Fleetwood stated, "If I have understood well the intentions of Harry Potter's author, they help children to see the difference between good and evil. And she is very clear on this." He added that Rowling is "Christian by conviction, is Christian in her mode of living, even in her way of writing." This comment was seized on by the media as an endorsement of the novels from the Catholic Church, and by extension, the Pope at that time, <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">John Paul II</a>, though there is no evidence that the Pope officially approved of the novels.

Also in 2003, the Prefect of the <a href="Congregation%20for%20the%20Doctrine%20of%20the%20Faith">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith</a>, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger – who later became <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> – received a manuscript of a book critical of the novels from a German author. He stated in a private letter expressing gratitude for the receipt of the book, "It is good that you enlighten people about Harry Potter, because those are subtle seductions, which act unnoticed and by this deeply distort Christianity in the <a href="soul">soul</a>, before it can grow properly." He also recommended she send a copy of her book to Fleetwood at the Council for Culture. In a second letter, the cardinal gave the author permission to make his first letter public. These letters from Ratzinger prior to his elevation to the papacy have been used to suggest that the pontiff was officially opposed to the novels.
Criticism against the books also comes from one of the official <a href="exorcist">exorcist</a>s of the Archdiocese of Rome, <a href="Gabriele%20Amorth">Gabriele Amorth</a>, who believes that, "Behind Harry Potter hides the signature of the king of the darkness, <a href="Satan">the devil</a>." He further told the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" that the books make a false distinction between black and white magic, while, in reality, the distinction "does not exist, because magic is always a turn to the devil." Amorth believes that the books can be a bad influence on children by getting them interested in the occult.

Before the release of "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Half-Blood%20Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a>" in 2005, Fleetwood, then serving with the <a href="Council%20of%20European%20Episcopal%20Conferences">Council of European Episcopal Conferences</a>, gave an interview with <a href="Vatican%20Radio">Vatican Radio</a>. In the interview, Fleetwood reaffirmed his positive opinion of the books, and remarked that then-Cardinal Ratzinger's letters may have been written by a member of the congregation's staff and simply signed by the prefect. He also stated that his and Amorth's opinions are just that, conflicting personal opinions of priests.

For the film adaptations, the <a href="United%20States%20Conference%20of%20Catholic%20Bishops%27%20Office%20for%20Film%20and%20Broadcasting">Office for Film and Broadcasting</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Conference%20of%20Catholic%20Bishops">United States Conference of Catholic Bishops</a> has rated each film either "A-II" or "A-III", meaning the content was not found to be morally offensive. The <a href="Episcopal%20Conference">Episcopal Conference</a> named the <a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Prisoner%20of%20Azkaban%20%28film%29">film adaptation of "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"</a> as one of the ten best family films of 2004, and "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Deathly%20Hallows%20-%20Part%201">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1</a>" as one of the best movies of 2010.

The Vatican newspaper, "<a href="L%27Osservatore%20Romano">L'Osservatore Romano</a>", dedicated a full page to the debate in its 14–15 January 2008 issue. Essayist Paolo Gulisano said the "Harry Potter" novels offer lessons in the importance of love and self-giving, but Professor Edoardo Rialti described Harry Potter as "the wrong kind of hero" and said that, "Despite several positive values that can be found in the story, at the foundations of this tale is the proposal that of witchcraft as positive, the violent manipulation of things and people thanks to the knowledge of the occult, an advantage of a select few: the ends justify the means because the knowledgeable, the chosen ones, the intellectuals know how to control the dark powers and turn them into good… This is a grave and deep lie, because it is the old Gnostic temptation of confusing salvation and truth with a secret knowledge." However, in July 2009, "L'Osservatore Romano" praised the moral stance of the sixth "Harry Potter" film, "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Half-Blood%20Prince%20%28film%29">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a>", saying, "There is a clear line of demarcation between good and evil and [the film] makes clear that good is right. One understands as well that sometimes this requires hard work and sacrifice." It also noted that the film made clear that "the search for immortality epitomised by Lord Voldemort" was morally wrong.

A French <a href="Traditionalist%20Catholic">Traditionalist Catholic</a> circle has published a thorough critical study of the Harry Potter series along the lines of <a href="demonology">demonology</a>, with the title – in English translation – "Harry Potter and the Order of Darkness".

In 2002, the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox Church</a> authorities in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> released a statement denouncing the "Harry Potter" books as Satanic, saying that they "acquaint people with evil, wizardry, the occult and <a href="demonology">demonology</a>." The statement also criticised the purported similarities between Harry Potter and <a href="Jesus">Jesus Christ</a>, saying, "It is beyond doubt that Harry was made to resemble a young savior. Upon his birth people try to kill him, he is forever subjected to injustice but always supernaturally manages to prevail and save others. Let us reflect, who else … is held to be the unjustly treated God?"

In June 2004, soon after a <a href="Bulgarians">native Bulgarian</a>, <a href="Stanislav%20Ianevski">Stanislav Ianevski</a>, had been cast to portray the character <a href="Viktor%20Krum">Viktor Krum</a> in <a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Goblet%20of%20Fire%20%28film%29">the film adaptation of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"</a>, the <a href="Bulgarian%20Orthodox%20Church">Bulgarian Orthodox Church</a> printed a front-page article in their official newspaper, claiming that "magic is not a children's game," and that the holy Synod had advised that a church in <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a> hold special <a href="Divine%20Liturgy">liturgies</a> every Thursday to cure those afflicted by spells or possessed by evil spirits. Pamphlets were posted throughout the city, claiming that reciting a "Harry Potter" spell "is as if you are praying to <a href="evil">evil</a>", and that "God hates magic."

However, the Russian Orthodox <a href="apologetics">apologist</a> deacon Andrei Kuraev argued in his 2003 book "Harry Potter in the Church: Between an Anathema and a Smile" that the Harry Potter books are not dangerous. His arguments include the books' similarity with traditional fairy tales and literary classics such as the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" which no-one calls "Satanic"; the difference between the books' magic and real occult practices; the presence of Christian values such as humility, love, sacrifice and choosing the right over the easy. He quotes other notable Orthodox priests and church officials such as M. Kozlov and S. Pravdoliubov as supporting his position.
The American academic and Orthodox Christian writer <a href="John%20Granger">John Granger</a> has analyzed the literature in a positive light. Granger, a Christian <a href="classicism">classicist</a>, has defended the books in his book, "Looking for God in Harry Potter". Granger argues that the books do not promote the occult because none of the magic is based on summoning any sort of demon or spirit; he contrasts occult "invocational" magic (calling up spirit beings to do your bidding) with literature's common "incantational" magic (saying a set phrase to use power from an unspecified source). Indeed, says Granger, the themes of love triumphing over death and choosing what is right instead of what is easy are very compatible with Christianity.

In 2000, the Dean of <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a> refused to allow his church to be filmed as part of <a href="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a> in the "Harry Potter" film series, saying that it was unfitting for a Christian church to be used to promote pagan imagery. <a href="Gloucester%20Cathedral">Gloucester Cathedral</a> agreed to take its place; the Dean of Gloucester, the Very Reverend Nicholas Bury, admitted to being a fan of the books; "I think the book is a marvellous traditional children's story and excellently written. It is also amusing, exciting and wholesome, and is just the sort of story families should be encouraged to read." The decision still resulted in many angry letters to the local paper, the "Gloucester Citizen". Said one honorary chaplain, "Oh yes, there was quite a to-do. There was one particular man, very evangelical, writing in and complaining that it wasn't right for such things to be going on. I don't think it was so much the film's subject matter but the fact that filming was happening at all." Similarly, <a href="Durham%20Cathedral">Durham Cathedral</a> also allowed its use for two of the films.

Then-<a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> <a href="George%20Carey">George Carey</a> gave positive remarks about the <a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Philosopher%27s%20Stone%20%28film%29">"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" film</a> in his New Year Message for 2002, calling it "great fun," and a film that "asks some very real questions" on moral issues.

In June 2007, the Anglican Church published "Mixing it up with Harry Potter", a 48-page book designed to use parallels from the novels to teach the faith to 9–13-year-olds. The author of the book, <a href="Kent">Kent</a> youth worker Owen Smith, argued that, "These sessions draw parallels between events in the world of Harry and his friends, and the world in which we are seeking to proclaim the gospel to young people [...] To say, as some have, that these books draw younger readers towards the occult seems to me both to malign J. K. Rowling and to vastly underestimate the ability of children and young people to separate the real from the imaginary."

<a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church) has expressed no official or unofficial reservations or cautions about the Harry Potter books and movies, all of which are freely sold at the <a href="Brigham%20Young%20University">Brigham Young University</a> campus bookstore. At least two prominent leaders of the church have even recommended the series and spoke of being fans because they teach morality and show good victorious over evil.

A large number of Islamic scholars have argued that the books' magical themes conflict with <a href="Islam">Islam</a>ic teachings. A series of online <a href="fat%C4%81wa">fatāwa</a> have been logged by <a href="imam">imam</a>s against "Harry Potter", decrying it as un-Islamic.

The Harry Potter books are banned in schools across the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> (UAE). According to a spokesman from the education ministry of the UAE government, the books' <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> and <a href="Magic%20in%20fiction">magic</a> elements were contrary to Islamic values. Despite being banned from schools in the Emirates, there are no plans to ban them from bookshops within the country.

In August 2007, police in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> discovered and defused a <a href="car%20bomb">car bomb</a> located outside a shopping centre where, hours later, the final "Harry Potter" novel was scheduled to go on sale. The book launch was postponed in response. A local police superintendent commented that, "We are not sure so far whether the target of the bombing was the book launch, but the connection cannot be ruled out."

<a href="Feiz%20Mohammad">Feiz Mohammad</a>, the Australian radical Islamic preacher believed to have inspired <a href="Tamerlan%20Tsarnaev">Tamerlan</a> and <a href="Dzhokhar%20Tsarnaev">Dzhokhar Tsarnaev</a>, the perpetrators of the <a href="Boston%20Marathon%20bombing">Boston Marathon bombing</a>, decried "Harry Potter" for "paganism, evil, magic and the drinking of unicorn blood".

Many prominent <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>s have described the "Harry Potter" books as, in the words of one, "a force for good". In 2005, a conference at the <a href="University%20of%20Reading">University of Reading</a> debated whether Harry Potter had a ""yiddishe <a href="Soul%23Judaism">neshama</a>"" (Jewish soul). <a href="Jonathan%20Sacks">Sir Jonathan Sacks</a>, the former chief Rabbi of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, claims that, in "a society in which adolescents are precociously adult, and adults are permanently adolescent", "Harry Potter" has "reclaimed the kingdom of childhood, proving that you don’t have to betray to enchant".

The decision to release the final volume of the "Harry Potter" series, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", in <a href="Israel">Israel</a> at 2 AM on a Saturday morning briefly angered many of Israel's rabbis, since it fell during the <a href="Shabbat">Jewish Sabbath</a>, a time when business dealings are forbidden.

The books' inclusion in public and school libraries has been frequently <a href="Challenge%20%28literature%29">challenged</a> for their focus on magic, particularly in the United States, where it was ranked seventh on the list of the most challenged books in American libraries between 1990 and 2000 despite having been first published in the United States in 1998. In 1999, the "Harry Potter" books were challenged 23 times in 13 states. According to the <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a>, they are now the most challenged books of the 21st century.

However, the ALA notes that overall, opposition to "Harry Potter" in the US appears to be waning; having topped the list of the most challenged books in American schools in many previous years, they have to date failed to reappear in the top ten since 2003. Humanist commentator <a href="Austin%20Cline">Austin Cline</a> attributes this decline to school libraries employing "opt-out" policies which allow parents to prohibit their children from reading books they do not wish them exposed to.

A selection follows of the more notable challenges to the books:

In 1999, in response to complaints from three local parents, <a href="Zeeland%2C%20Michigan">Zeeland, Michigan</a> school superintendent Gary Feenstra restricted access to the "Harry Potter" books to those pupils whose parents gave written permission. Later reports claimed that the parents were concerned about the books' magical and witchcraft-related themes. In response, children began a letter-writing campaign, forming clubs and organising petitions, which ultimately merged into an internet site called Muggles for Harry Potter. Eventually the site took on a broader remit as kidSPEAK!, a forum for children to tackle <a href="censorship">censorship</a> in general.

In 2000, The Public Library system of <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a> was faced with a lawsuit from <a href="conservatism">conservative</a> Christian group Liberty Counsel of Orlando after they began awarding "Hogwarts’ Certificate of Accomplishment" to young readers who completed the fourth "Harry Potter" novel, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire". One parent complained that "If they are going to pass out witchcraft certificates they should also promote the Bible and pass out certificates of righteousness". The lawsuit was averted after the Library agreed to stop awarding the certificate. That same year, Carol Rookwood, headmistress of <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Island%2C%20Medway">St Mary's Island</a> <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> Aided School in <a href="Chatham%2C%20Kent">Chatham, Kent</a>, England, banned the books from school grounds, saying that, "The Bible is very clear and consistent in its teachings that wizards, devils and demons exist and are very real, powerful and dangerous, and God's people are told to have nothing to do with them". In response, the chairman of the Church of England's doctrine commission, Stephen Sykes, said, "The Church's position is that magic and sorcery are contrary to the Christian religion, Mrs Rookwood is absolutely right. [But] children who are capable of reading Harry Potter could be told not to take witchcraft seriously, or might even realise that for themselves". In July 2000, Birkenhead Primary School in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, New Zealand placed a ban on the "Harry Potter" novels being read aloud by teachers in class after parental complaints regarding the books' supposedly occult content. However, the ban was lifted after a number of students and parents complained. Also in 2000, Christian parents complained to the <a href="Durham%20District%20School%20Board">school board</a> in <a href="Regional%20Municipality%20of%20Durham">Durham Region, Ontario</a> about "Harry Potter", and managed to get the books removed from school library shelves. The books were reinstated after a public outcry.

In 2002, in <a href="York%2C%20Pennsylvania">York, Pennsylvania</a>, local parent Deb DiEugenio, along with her pastor, attempted to have the books banned from her daughter's school. DuEugenio said that "It's against my daughter's constitution, it's evil, it's witchcraft ... I'm not paying taxes to teach my child witchcraft". The school board eventually voted 7–2 to keep the books, with an opt-out for concerned parents.

In 2003, Billy Ray and Mary Nell Counts, a couple in <a href="Cedarville%2C%20Arkansas">Cedarville, Arkansas</a>, brought suit against the local school board on behalf of their daughter to contest a rule requiring parents' written consent to read the "Harry Potter" books. A parent, Angie Haney, had requested such a rule on the grounds that they were "not based on fiction," at the prompting of Pastor Mark Hodges, who was also a member of the school board. A <a href="Jimm%20Larry%20Hendren">district court judge</a> decided the rule was unconstitutional. The decision was cited as precedent in subsequent censorship cases. Also in 2003, a <a href="Russians">Russian</a> woman filed charges against Rosman Publishing, responsible for "Harry Potter"s Russian translation, saying that the books "instilled religious extremism and prompted students to join religious organizations of Satanist followers". A probe found that there were no grounds for a criminal prosecution.

In September 2005, Laura Mallory, a mother of four children in <a href="Loganville%2C%20Georgia">Loganville, Georgia</a>, attempted to have the "Harry Potter" books banned from her children's school library on the grounds that they promoted a religion, <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>, and thus for a public school library to hold them would violate the separation of church and state. On her website, she states, "Harry Potter is being used to teach and promote witchcraft, Wicca, a U.S. [Government] recognised religion, in our schools, classrooms, and to this entire generation." Mallory said the books carry "evil themes, witchcraft, demonic activity, murder, evil blood sacrifice, spells and teaching children all of this." Mallory, who is a <a href="Mission%20%28Christian%29">Christian missionary</a>, said that she believed the books encouraged children to practice religious witchcraft or become Wiccans. Mallory also commented that she has not read the entire book series because "they're really very long and I have four kids. I've put a lot of work into what I've studied and read. I think it would be hypocritical for me to read all the books, honestly". Following her case's rejection by the school, Mallory then took her case to the school appeals committee, but was rejected again. On 20 April 2006, Mallory took her case to the <a href="Gwinnett%20County%2C%20Georgia">Gwinnett County</a> School Board, but on 11 May, the board voted unanimously against her. In June 2006, Mallory launched an appeal against the County Board's decision with the Georgia State Board of Education; that appeal was rejected the following December. In January 2007, she <a href="appeal">appeal</a>ed to the Gwinnett Superior Court; that appeal too was rejected three months later. She considered taking the case to federal court, but spent the following summer with her husband and four children. She is now an ordained <a href="Minister%20%28Christianity%29">minister</a> for children and young adults, claiming that her case against "Harry Potter" has inspired her to a new calling.

In July 2006, Sariya Allan, a teaching assistant at Durand Primary School in <a href="Stockwell">Stockwell</a>, <a href="South%20London">South London</a>, quit her job after she was suspended for refusing to listen to a seven-year-old pupil read a "Harry Potter" book in class. A practising <a href="Pentecostalism">Pentecostal</a>, she told the girl that "I don't do witchcraft in any form," and that she would be "cursed" if she heard the novel recited. Allan took her dispute with the school to an <a href="Employment%20Tribunal">Employment Tribunal</a>, citing religious discrimination and claiming for damages. The school's lawyer claimed that, "her suspension was due to her obstructive conduct over time. It was not down to that day alone." The case was heard in June 2007 and the tribunal found in favour of the school.

In September 2007, Pastor Ron Barker of St. Joseph Church in <a href="Wakefield%2C%20Massachusetts">Wakefield, Massachusetts</a> received international attention after pulling the books from the shelves of the parish's K-8 school. According to the ALA, this was the first time the books were banned in Massachusetts. The <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Boston">Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston</a> claimed this was an independent action in which the Church played no role. "It may be a great series, but for some it is a vehicle for entering into some occult practices," he said. "Sorcery and witchcraft are not appropriate subjects for a Catholic school and I do not want parents or children thinking we approve of them in our library." He claimed his actions were no different from protecting children with a <a href="peanut%20allergy">peanut allergy</a>; "What I did is start a spiritual peanut butter ban on Harry Potter," he said.

In response to the criticism that the books promote <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>, a number of Wiccans and other commenters have argued that the critics' definition of Wicca tends to lump together many and various spiritualist practices that actually have little in common. They have also highlighted the differences between magic within Wicca, which is <a href="invocation">invocation</a>al and derives from the divine powers, and that depicted by the "Harry Potter" books, which is a purely mechanical application of spells without invoking any deities. A Wiccan review of "Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged" pointed out that "communing with the dead and spirit world, sorcery, curses, occult symbology, black magic [and] demon possession"—all cited by the book as evidence of "Harry Potter" promoting Wicca—are not part of Wiccan belief.

Divinatory practices such as <a href="scrying">scrying</a> and <a href="astrology">astrology</a>, although occasionally employed by characters in the books are neither unique nor central to the Wiccan religion and are treated in the novels in a condescending, tongue-in-cheek manner; the school divination teacher is, according to writer Christine Schoeffer, "a misty, dreamy, dewy charlatan," who is ridiculed by the students and staff alike. In the "Harry Potter" universe, Schoeffer claims, "the entire intuitive tradition of fortune-telling … is discredited."

The website <a href="religioustolerance.org">religioustolerance.org</a> says, in their analysis of Chick's "The Nervous Witch", that the comic's heroine cries that 'she got into "The Craft" (i.e. Wicca) "Through the Harry Potter books! We wanted his powers … so we called for spirit guides. Then they came into us." In reality, <a href="spirit%20guide">spirit guide</a>s are unrelated to the Witchcraft in the "Harry Potter" books and are not sought by Wiccans. They are a <a href="New%20Age">New Age</a> phenomenon.'

Regardless, statements such as those in "Witchcraft Repackaged" that the books depict actual <a href="occult">occult</a>ist practices of any kind have been roundly criticised. Christian writer Stephen D. Greydanus writes that the magic of the "Harry Potter" novels is not the ritualistic, invocative magic of Wicca or occultism but the same "fantasy" magic practised in the works of <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> and <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>; "If anything, the magic in Rowling's world is even more emphatically imaginary, even further removed from real-world practices, than that of Tolkien or Lewis; and, like theirs, presents no appreciable risk of direct imitative behaviour." "Christianity Today" columnist <a href="Charles%20Colson">Charles Colson</a> asserts that the magic in "Harry Potter" is "purely mechanical, as opposed to occultic. That is, Harry and his friends cast spells, read crystal balls, and turn themselves into animals—but they don't make contact with a supernatural world. [It's not] the kind of real-life witchcraft the Bible condemns." Austin Cline notes that, "The Harry Potter books simply aren't about Wicca as it is currently practiced. J.K. Rowling researched Wiccan practices and incorporated a few elements in order to give her books a bit more of an air of reality, but she and Wicca are drawing upon the same corpus of ancient traditions and stories so similarities are inevitable. They certainly aren't a sign that the books work to "indoctrinate" people into Wicca as a religion."

In his book, John Granger makes a critical distinction between what he calls the dangerous "invocational" magic (calling a spirit) and Rowling's "incantational" magic, in which the formula one speaks gets the job done, and says that her presentation to the materialistic world that there is more out there than is visible is doing a service for the cause of Christian evangelism.

Connie Neal has commented that, "there are 64 real references to witchcraft in the first four "Harry Potter" books, but you have to see them in context to know they are not teaching witchcraft or sorcery. Many of the detractors who have actually read the books already have made up their mind that "Harry Potter" is evil before they read. They have taken a magnifying glass and picked at the books, using literary <a href="reductionism">reductionism</a> to find what they want to find. You can pick up <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Dickens</a>' "<a href="A%20Christmas%20Carol">A Christmas Carol</a>" and do the same thing that these people have done with "Harry Potter"; it is ridiculous."

In 2001, <a href="Massimo%20Introvigne">Massimo Introvigne</a>, an Italian expert in emerging religious movements, criticised the Fundamentalist impulse to distrust fantasy. "Fundamentalists reject, or even burn, all products of contemporary popular culture, because their modes of production, languages and styles are not intrinsically Christian [...] Most children understand that magic is used in fairy tales and juvenile supernatural fiction as a century-old language, and that this is fiction, not reality. If we dismiss the use of magic as a language, we should at least be fundamentalist to the bitter end, and go against "Mary Poppins," "Peter Pan," and "Sleeping Beauty," and insist that Cinderella puts a <a href="burqa">burkha</a> on."

Another response to the claim that the books promote the religion of witchcraft, which has been raised as much by Christians critical of the books as those who support them, is that, far from promoting religion, the books do not promote religion in any way. Apart from celebrating <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> and <a href="Easter">Easter</a> and a non-denominational clergyman presiding at both Dumbledore's funeral and the Weasleys' wedding, religious practices are largely absent from the books. In her critical editorial on the books, <a href="Focus%20on%20the%20Family">Focus on the Family</a>'s Lindy Beam comments, "The spiritual fault of "Harry Potter" is not so much that Rowling is playing to dark supernatural powers, but that she doesn't acknowledge any supernatural powers at all. These stories are not fueled by witchcraft, but by secularism." The "Harry Potter" books have been lauded by <a href="atheism">atheists</a> and <a href="secularism">secularists</a> for their determinedly non-religious outlook. Mika LaVaque-Manty of the liberal website Left2Right notes, "Religion plays no role in the books. There are no churches, no other religious institutions, nobody prays or meditates, and even funerals are non-religious affairs." When considering the role of religion within "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", <a href="Christopher%20Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens</a> observed the apparent secularism in the novel, stating that the characters of Harry and Hermione possess certain moral virtues while also expressing an ignorance of Christian ideas. In an article written for "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine before the publication of the seventh and final book in the series entitled "Who Dies in Harry Potter? God," <a href="Lev%20Grossman">Lev Grossman</a> argues that, "Harry Potter lives in a world free of any religion or spirituality of any kind. He lives surrounded by ghosts but has no one to pray to, even if he were so inclined, which he isn't." Grossman goes on to contrast "<a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a>" with other, more explicitly religious fantasies, such as <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>' "<a href="The%20Chronicles%20of%20Narnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>" and <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>".

J. K. Rowling has repeatedly denied that her books lead children into witchcraft. In an interview with <a href="CNN">CNN</a> in 1999, she said,

I absolutely did not start writing these books to encourage any child into witchcraft. I'm laughing slightly because to me, the idea is absurd. I have met thousands of children and not even one time has a child come up to me and said, "Ms Rowling, I'm so glad I've read these books because now I want to be a witch."
In an interview on the "<a href="Donny%20%26amp%3B%20Marie%20%281998%20TV%20series%29">Donny & Marie Show</a>" in 1999, Rowling said that "You have a perfect right, of course, as every parent does, and I'm a parent, to decide what your child is exposed to. You do not have the right to decide what everyone else's children are exposed to. So that's how I feel about it".

"Practicing Wiccans think I'm also a witch", Rowling told "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" in 2000. "I'm not."

"People underestimate children so hugely", Rowling said when asked about the controversy in the 2001 documentary "Harry Potter and Me", "They know it's fiction. When people are arguing from that kind of standpoint, I don't think reason works tremendously well. But I would be surprised if some of them had read the books at all."

In a conversation on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> in December 2014, Rowling tweeted, "To everyone asking whether their religion/belief/non-belief system is represented at Hogwarts: the only people I never imagined there are wiccans ... it's a different concept of magic to the one laid out in the books, so I don't really see how they can co-exist."

While many describe the books as secular or Satanic, many writers, including Rowling herself, have gone to great lengths to demonstrate that the books actively promote Christian values.

Rowling attended a <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> congregation while writing "Harry Potter" and her eldest daughter, Jessica, was baptised into that faith. "I go to church myself", she told MTV in 2007, "I don't take any responsibility for the lunatic fringes of my own religion". In 2000, when asked if she was a Christian by journalist Max Wyman of "<a href="The%20Vancouver%20Sun">The Vancouver Sun</a>", she replied:

Yes, I am, which seems to offend the religious right far worse than if I said I thought there was no God. Every time I've been asked if I believe in God, I've said yes, because I do, but no one ever really has gone any more deeply into it than that, and I have to say that does suit me, because if I talk too freely about that I think the intelligent reader, whether 10 or 60, will be able to guess what's coming in the books.
"Personally", she said of her religious faith, "I think you can see that in the books. Of course, Hogwarts is a multifaith school." Rowling claims to have been very careful not to colour her novels in an overtly religious way, lest one faith be given prominence over any other. Rowling said that to her, the moral significance of the tales seems "blindingly obvious". The key for her was the choice between what is right and what is easy, "because that, that is how tyranny is started, with people being apathetic and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble." In an interview with <a href="MTV">MTV</a> after the publication of the last book, she is quoted as saying, "To me [the religious parallels have] always been obvious, but I never wanted to talk too openly about it because I thought it might show people who just wanted the story where we were going."

In 2007, Rowling described her religious background in an interview with the <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> newspaper "<a href="De%20Volkskrant">De Volkskrant</a>":

I was officially raised in the Church of England, but I was actually more of a freak in my family. We didn't talk about religion in our home. My father didn't believe in anything, neither did my sister. My mother would incidentally visit the church, but mostly during Christmas. And I was immensely curious. From when I was 13, 14 I went to church alone. I found it very interesting what was being said there, and I believed in it. When I went to university, I became more critical. I got more annoyed with the smugness of religious people and I went to church less and less. Now I'm at the point where I started: yes, I believe. And yes, I go to the church. A protestant church here in Edinburgh. My husband is also raised protestant, but he comes from a very strict Scottish group. One where they couldn't sing and talk.
Rowling has occasionally expressed ambivalence about her religious faith. In a 2006 interview with "<a href="Tatler%20%281901%29">Tatler</a>" magazine, Rowling noted that, "like <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a>, my faith is sometimes about if my faith will return. It's important to me." In a British documentary, "JK Rowling: A Year in the Life", when asked if she believed in God, she said, "Yes. I do struggle with it; I couldn't pretend that I'm not doubt-ridden about a lot of things and that would be one of them but I would say yes." When asked if she believed in an afterlife, she said, "Yes; I think I do." In a 2008 interview with the Spanish newspaper "<a href="El%20Pa%C3%ADs">El País</a>", Rowling said, "I feel very drawn to religion, but at the same time I feel a lot of uncertainty. I live in a state of spiritual flux. I believe in the permanence of the soul."

Several Christian writers have compared Rowling to the <a href="Inklings">Inklings</a>, a group that included <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>, <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Williams%20%28British%20writer%29">Charles Williams</a>, who explored Christian themes and morality in a fantasy context. Dave Kopel, citing John Granger's book, draws comparisons between Rowling's and Lewis's common usage of Christian symbols, such as lions, unicorns and stags. He compares the work to Lewis's Christian allegory: "In the climax of "Chamber of Secrets", Harry descends to a deep underworld, is confronted by two satanic minions (Voldemort and a giant serpent), is saved from certain death by his faith in Dumbledore (the bearded God the Father/Ancient of Days), rescues the virgin (Virginia Weasley), and ascends in triumph. It's "<a href="The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Progress">Pilgrim's Progress</a>" for a new audience." (This quotation predates Rowling's revelation that <a href="Ginny%20Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>'s full name is Ginevra, not Virginia.)

Other Christian writers find Rowling's treatment of magic less acceptable than Lewis's and Tolkien's. In his essay "Harry Potter vs. Gandalf," Steven D. Greydanus notes that in the works of Tolkien and Lewis, magic is confined to alien realms with their own laws, whereas Rowling's world coexists with our own; he thinks this is wrong: "Lewis goes to great lengths to make clear just how dangerous and wrong, how incompatible with Christianity, is any form of attempted magic in our world." John Andrew Murray similarly observes that Rowling's work portrays magic as a natural force to be manipulated, while Lewis and Tolkien portray magic as a gift bestowed by a higher power: "Despite superficial similarities, Rowling's and Lewis' worlds are as far apart as east is from west. Rowling's work invites children to a world where witchcraft is 'neutral' and where authority is determined solely by one's cleverness. Lewis invites readers to a world where God's authority is not only recognised, but celebrated — a world that resounds with His goodness and care."

Rowling's attitude toward the Inklings, and to Lewis in particular, has undergone change. In 1998, in one of her earliest interviews, she said that she had a lifelong love of C. S. Lewis. "Even now, if I was in a room with one of the Narnia books I would pick it up like a shot and re-read it." However, in later interviews she expressed a different opinion. "I adored [Lewis' books] when I was a child," she told "The Sydney Morning Herald" in 2001, "I got so caught up I didn't think C. S. Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal." In an interview with Lev Grossman in 2005, she said, "There comes a point [in Lewis' "<a href="The%20Last%20Battle">The Last Battle</a>"] where Susan, who was the older girl, is lost to Narnia because she becomes interested in lipstick. She's become irreligious basically because she found sex. I have a big problem with that."

"I did not set out to convert anyone to Christianity," she told "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" in 2007; "I wasn't trying to do what C. S. Lewis did. It is perfectly possible to live a very moral life without a belief in God, and I think it's perfectly possible to live a life peppered with ill-doing and believe in God."

As regards Tolkien, Rowling said in 2000 that "I didn't read "<a href="The%20Hobbit">The Hobbit</a>" until after the first Harry book was written, though I read "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">Lord of the Rings</a>" when I was nineteen. I think, setting aside the obvious fact that we both use myth and legend, that the similarities are fairly superficial. Tolkien created a whole new mythology, which I would never claim to have done. On the other hand, I think I have better jokes."

A number of commentators have drawn attention to the Biblical themes and references in her final "Harry Potter" novel, "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Deathly%20Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a>". In an August 2007 issue of "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>", Lisa Miller commented that Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. She points out the title of the chapter in which this occurs—"King's Cross"—a possible allusion to Christ's cross. Also, she outlines the scene in which Harry is temporarily dead, pointing out that it places Harry in a very heaven-like setting where he talks to a father figure "whose supernatural powers are accompanied by a profound message of love". Miller argues that these parallels make it difficult to believe that the basis of the stories is Satanic. There is also speculation from <a href="The%20Leaky%20Cauldron%20%28website%29">The Leaky Cauldron's</a> <a href="podcast">podcast</a>, <a href="PotterCast">PotterCast</a>, episode 115 entitled "Those Deathly Hallows," in the Canon Conclusion segment with <a href="Steve%20Vander%20Ark">Steve Vander Ark</a>, that the Hallows act as a parallel to the Holy Trinity; Harry accepts death as did Jesus, they both come back from death, and defeat the Devil/Voldemort. Jeffrey Weiss adds, in "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>", that the biblical quotation "And the last enemy that shall be defeated is death," featured on the tombstones of Harry's parents, refers to Christ's victory over death at the end of the world. The quotation on Dumbledore's family tomb, "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also", is from Matthew 6:21, and refers to knowing which things in life are of true value. "They're very British books," Rowling revealed to an Open Book conference in October 2007, "So on a very practical note Harry was going to find biblical quotations on tombstones, [but] I think those two particular quotations he finds on the tombstones at Godric's Hollow, … almost epitomise the whole series." Tom Willow stated that "Harry Potter going knowingly to his death at the hands of Voldemort, willing to sacrifice himself to save his friends, is reminiscent of <a href="Aslan">Aslan</a> similarly sacrificing himself in <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>' "<a href="The%20Lion%2C%20the%20Witch%20and%20the%20Wardrobe">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>". There is no doubt that Aslan's sacrifice was modeled by Lewis on <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a> going to <a href="Golgotha">Golgotha</a>. It is logical to assume that, directly or indirectly, that was also the model for Harry Potter's sacrifice." 

"Deathly Hallows" begins with a pair of epigraphs, one by <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Quaker</a> leader <a href="William%20Penn">William Penn</a> and one from <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>' "<a href="Oresteia%23The%20Libation%20Bearers">The Libation Bearers</a>". "I really enjoyed choosing those two quotations because one is pagan, of course, and one is from a Christian tradition", Rowling said. "I'd known it was going to be those two passages since 'Chamber' was published. I always knew [that] if I could use them at the beginning of book seven then I'd cued up the ending perfectly. If they were relevant, then I went where I needed to go. They just say it all to me, they really do."

Raymond Keating also outlines several Christian themes of the last book in an article in "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>", concluding that "It's possible to read "Lord of the Rings" and "Narnia" without recognizing the religious aspects. That's even more so the case with "Harry Potter". But Christian themes are there nonetheless". Christian commentator Jerry Bowyer says of Rowling's "fundamentalist bashers", "So much of the religious right failed to see the Christianity in the "Potter" novels because it knows so little Christianity itself [...] The gospel stories themselves, the various metaphors and figures of the Law and the Prophets, and their echoes down through the past two millennia of Christian literature and art are largely unknown to vast swaths of American Christendom." As regards Rowling's belief that discussing her faith would spoil the books, Bowyer says, "For once, I disagree with her: I don't think [the bashers] would have guessed the ending. Most of them can't recognise the ending of the story even after it's been told."

In her appraisal of the series, "The Mystery of Harry Potter: A Catholic Family Guide", author Nancy Carpentier Brown writes:

After burying the remains of Mad-Eye Moody, Harry "marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand." Now, if they were true Wiccans, wouldn’t he have gouged a pentagram? When Harry finally has the chance to face Voldemort (Tom Riddle) and possibly kill him, Harry pauses and offers Voldemort a chance, saying, "Show some remorse." ... Giving a person a chance to redeem themselves, to begin to realise your own sins, by showing remorse, shows a Christian theme to the story.
On 19 October 2007, Rowling spoke at <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>'s <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>. When asked by a fan whether <a href="Albus%20Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, the books' wise mentor-figure, "who believed in the prevailing power of love, ever [fell] in love himself", Rowling replied:

My truthful answer to you … I always thought of Dumbledore as gay. … Dumbledore fell in love with <a href="Gellert%20Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a>, and that added to his horror when Grindelwald showed himself to be what he was … falling in love can blind us to an extent … he was very drawn to this brilliant person, and horribly, terribly let down by him.

The statement was met with an ovation from the audience. "If I'd known it would make you so happy, I would have announced it years ago!" Rowling said. In an appearance three days later in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, she responded to questions about Dumbledore's "outing" by saying that she had decided his sexuality "from very early on. Probably before the first book was published."

Christians critical of both "Harry Potter" and homosexuality responded pointedly to the revelation. Christian author Berit Kjos wrote:

My first response was, "Thank you, Lord," because this helps us show others that these books should not be used in the churches to illustrate Christianity. Because Dumbledore has been revealed as a homosexual, it helps me communicate my message. It helps Christians who are concerned about the use of Harry Potter books in churches, because it makes it very clear that these books are not intended to be Christian, that Rowling isn't speaking as a Christian. She has introduced values that are contrary to the Biblical message.
Laura Mallory responded to Rowling's statement by telling U.S. network ABC, "My prayer is that parents would wake up, that the subtle way this is presented as harmless fantasy would be exposed for what it really is: a subtle indoctrination into anti-Christian values … A homosexual lifestyle is a harmful one. That's proven, medically."

John Granger, in his blog, riposted the negative reactions of many Christians:

The media presentation of the event as Ms. Rowling’s endorsement of homosexuality and an anti-faith agenda was straight from <a href="Rita%20Skeeter">Rita Skeeter</a>'s notebook and part of their endless campaign to convince the public that Ms. Rowling is the enemy of their enemy, namely, the Church; the anguished and disappointed response of many Christian readers to these reports was also according to Culture War formula and in keeping with a hyper-extended understanding of the word "gay." "Dumbledore is gay" no more makes the books an invitation to homosexuality or contrary to orthodox Christian belief than "Sorcerer’s Stone" made them a "gateway to the occult."

Rowling commented on the dispute in an interview with the BBC. "Do I think a gay person can be a moral compass? I think it's ludicrous that we are asking that question in the 21st century. The Christian fundamentalists were never my base."

Catholic fantasy author Regina Doman wrote an essay titled "In Defense of Dumbledore", in which she argued that the books actually support <a href="Homosexuality%20and%20Roman%20Catholicism">Catholic teaching on homosexuality</a> because Dumbledore's relationship with the dark wizard Grindelwald leads to obviously terrible results, as he becomes interested in dark magic himself, neglects his responsibilities towards his younger sister and ultimately causes her death.

SMS Kaiser Wilhelm II

SMS "Kaiser Wilhelm II" ("His Majesty's Ship Emperor William II") was the second ship of the of <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s. She was built at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">Imperial Dockyard</a> in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> and launched on 14 September 1897. The ship was commissioned into the fleet as its <a href="flagship">flagship</a> on 13 February 1900. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was armed with a main battery of four guns in two twin turrets. She was powered by <a href="triple%20expansion%20engine">triple expansion engine</a>s that delivered a top speed of .

"Kaiser Wilhelm II" served as the flagship of the Active Battle Fleet until 1906, participating in numerous fleet training exercises and visits to foreign ports. She was replaced as flagship by the new battleship . After the new <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s began entering service in 1908, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was decommissioned and put into reserve. She was reactivated in 1910 for training ship duties in the Baltic, but was again taken out of service in 1912.

With the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August 1914, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and her sisters were brought back into active duty as coastal defense ships in the V Battle Squadron. Her age, coupled with shortages of ship crews, led to her withdrawal from this role in February 1915, after which she served as a command ship for the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, based in Wilhelmshaven. Following the end of the war in November 1918, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was stricken from the navy list and sold for scrap in the early 1920s. Her bow ornament is preserved at the <a href="Military%20History%20Museum%20of%20the%20Bundeswehr">Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr</a> in Dresden.

After the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The former Secretary of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office), <a href="Leo%20von%20Caprivi">Leo von Caprivi</a> became the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor of Germany</a> in 1890, and "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hollmann">Friedrich von Hollmann</a> became the new Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt". Hollmann requested the first in 1892, but the <a href="Franco-Russian%20Alliance">Franco-Russian Alliance</a>, signed the year before, put the government's attention on expanding the Army's budget. Parliamentary opposition forced Hollmann to delay until the following year, when Caprivi spoke in favor of the project, noting that Russia's recent naval expansion threatened Germany's <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> coastline. In late 1893, Hollmann presented the Navy's estimates for the 1894–1895 budget year, and now the "Reichstag" approved the new ship. A second member of the class, "Kaiser Wilhelm II", was delayed until early 1896, when the "Reichstag" approved the ship for the 1896–1897 budget.

"Kaiser Wilhelm II" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of . Her <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> was forward and aft. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple-expansion%20engine">triple-expansion</a> <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a>s that drove three screw propellers. Steam was provided by four marine-type and eight cylindrical <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, all of which burned coal. "Kaiser Wilhelm II"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She had a normal crew of 39 officers and 612 enlisted men; while serving as the fleet flagship, she carried an additional admiral's staff of 12 officers and 51–63 enlisted men.

The ship's armament consisted of a main battery of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">24 cm (9.45 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">15 cm (5.91 inch) SK L/40 guns</a> and twelve <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.46 in) SK L/30</a> quick-firing guns mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s. She also carried twelve <a href="3.7%20cm%20Maxim%20machine%20cannon">37mm machine cannon</a>, but these were later removed. The armament suite was rounded out with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one of which was placed in an above-water swivel mount at the stern, with four submerged on the broadside and one submerged in the bow. The ship's <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was thick, and the deck was thick. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> and main battery turrets were protected with of armor plating, and the secondary casemates received of armor protection.

"Kaiser Wilhelm II"s keel was laid on 26 October 1896, at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">Kaiserliche Werft</a> in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>, under <a href="yard%20number">construction number</a> 24. Ordered under the contract name "Ersatz Friedrich der Grosse", to replace the elderly <a href="armored%20frigate">armored frigate</a> , she was launched on 14 September 1897. During the launching ceremony, "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" (Rear Admiral) <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281862%E2%80%931929%29">Prince Heinrich</a> christened the ship for his brother, <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>. She was commissioned on 13 February 1900, assuming the position of fleet <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, which she held until 1906. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was the first battleship of the German Navy specifically built to serve as a fleet flagship. After completing her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s in June 1900, she was assigned to the II Division of the I Squadron, where she replaced the old armored <a href="corvette">corvette</a> in the division and the battleship as flagship of the Active Battle Fleet.

In early July 1900, "Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm" and the other three "Brandenburg"-class battleships, which were assigned to the I Division of the I Squadron, were ordered to East Asian waters to assist in the suppression of the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a>. As a result, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and the other ships of the II Division were transferred to the I Division on 8 July, under the command of "Konteradmiral" <a href="Paul%20Hoffmann%20%28naval%20officer%29">Paul Hoffmann</a>. On 15 August the annual autumn maneuvers began; initially, the fleet practiced tactical maneuvers in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>. A cruise in battle formation through the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> followed, and the maneuvers concluded in the western Baltic on 21 September. During these exercises, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" served as the umpire ship, and so Hoffmann temporarily transferred his flag to her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> . He returned to "Kaiser Wilhelm II" on 29 September after the conclusion of the exercises in Kiel.
On 1 November 1900, "Kaiser Friedrich III" replaced "Kaiser Wilhelm II" as the I Squadron flagship; the latter, as the fleet flagship, remained assigned to the squadron for tactical purposes. From 4 to 15 December, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and the I Squadron went on a winter training cruise to Norway; the ships anchored at <a href="Larvik">Larvik</a> from 10 to 12 December. At 01:30 on 2 January 1901, she was steaming from <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> with "Kaiser Friedrich III" when the latter struck an underwater obstacle. The shock from the collision damaged the ship's boilers and started a fire in the coal bunkers. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" took her sister in tow, although the engines on "Kaiser Friedrich III" were restarted along the way. The ships eventually reached Kiel, where temporary repairs were conducted. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" went into drydock in January 1901 for overhaul and some modernization work. This included the reconstruction of a larger <a href="Bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> and the removal of some of her searchlights. While the ship was laid up, "<a href="Admiral">Admiral</a>" <a href="Hans%20von%20Koester">Hans von Koester</a> replaced Hoffmann as the fleet commander, a position he would hold until the end of 1906.

The annual training routine began at the end of March 1901 with squadron exercises in the Baltic. On the night of 1–2 April, "Kaiser Friedrich III" ran hard aground on the <a href="Adlergrund">Adlergrund</a>, a shoal to the east of <a href="Cape%20Arkona">Cape Arkona</a>, and "Kaiser Wilhelm II" lightly brushed the bottom. After a short inspection, it was determined that "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was undamaged, and so Prince Heinrich transferred his flag to the ship on 23 April, while "Kaiser Friedrich III" went into drydock for repairs. In the meantime, on 18 April, Wilhelm II commissioned his son <a href="Prince%20Adalbert%20of%20Prussia%20%281884%E2%80%931948%29">Prince Adalbert</a> aboard "Kaiser Wilhelm II". On 27 April, the I Squadron conducted gunnery drills and a landing exercise off <a href="Apenrade">Apenrade</a>. By 17 June, "Kaiser Wilhelm II"s sister ship had entered service, and so she took over flagship duties for the squadron, while "Kaiser Wilhelm II" returned to serving as only the fleet flagship. The squadron then went on a cruise to Spain, and while docked in <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>, rendezvoused with the "Brandenburg"-class battleships returning from East Asian waters. The I Squadron was back in Kiel by 11 August, though the late arrival of the "Brandenburg"s delayed the participation of the I Squadron in the annual autumn fleet training. The maneuvers began with exercises in the German Bight, followed by a mock attack on the fortifications in the lower <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>. Gunnery drills took place in <a href="Kiel%20Bay">Kiel Bay</a> before the fleet steamed to <a href="Danzig%20Bay">Danzig Bay</a>; there, during the maneuvers, Wilhelm II and Czar <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a> visited the fleet and came aboard "Kaiser Wilhelm II". The autumn maneuvers concluded on 15 September. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and the rest of I Squadron went on their normal winter cruise to Norway in December, which included a stop at <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> from 7 to 12 December, when the ship was visited by King <a href="Oscar%20II%20of%20Sweden">Oscar II</a>.

In January 1902, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" went into dock at Wilhelmshaven for her annual overhaul. In mid-March, Wilhelm II and his wife, <a href="Augusta%20Victoria%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein">Augusta Victoria</a>, came aboard the ship and waited in the mouth of the Elbe for Wilhelm's brother Prince Heinrich, who was returning from the United States. The I Squadron then went on a short cruise in the western Baltic before embarking on a major cruise around the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, which lasted from 25 April to 28 May. Individual and squadron maneuvers took place from June to August, interrupted only by a cruise to Norway in July. During these maneuvers, three of "Kaiser Wilhelm II"s boiler tubes burst, but the damage was repaired by the start of the autumn maneuvers in August. These exercises began in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade</a>. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" took no active part in the exercises; she instead served as an observation ship for the commander of the fleet, as well as her namesake, Kaiser Wilhelm II. The regular winter cruise followed during 1–12 December.

The first quarter of 1903 followed the usual pattern of training exercises. The squadron went on a training cruise in the Baltic, followed by a voyage to Spain that lasted from 7 May to 10 June. After returning to Germany, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" participated in the <a href="Kiel%20Week">Kiel Week</a> sailing <a href="regatta">regatta</a>. In July, she joined the I Squadron for the annual cruise to Norway. The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea, a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September, and finally a mock attack on Kiel. The exercises concluded on 12 September. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" finished the year's training schedule with a cruise into the eastern Baltic that started on 23 November and a cruise into the Skagerrak that began on 1 December. During the latter, the ship stopped in the Danish port of <a href="Frederikshavn">Frederikshavn</a>.
"Kaiser Wilhelm II" participated in an exercise in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904, after which she returned to Kiel. She then went to the Norwegian city of <a href="%C3%85lesund">Ålesund</a> to assist with <a href="%C3%85lesund%20Fire">the major fire</a> that devastated the largely wooden city on 23 January. Squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March. A major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May, and "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was again present at Kiel Week in June, where she was visited by Britain's King <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>, Lord <a href="William%20Palmer%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Selborne">William Palmer</a>, and <a href="Prince%20Louis%20of%20Battenberg">Prince Louis of Battenberg</a>. In June, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" won the Kaiser's "Schießpreis" (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery. The following month, the I Squadron and the <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> visited Britain, including a stop at <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 10 July. The German fleet departed on 13 July, bound for the Netherlands; the I Squadron anchored in <a href="Vlissingen">Vlissingen</a> the following day. There, the ships were visited by Queen <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Wilhelmina</a>. The I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July, when they departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet. The squadron stopped in <a href="Molde">Molde</a>, Norway, on 29 July, while the other units went to other ports.

The fleet reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August. During its cruise in the North Sea, the fleet experimented with <a href="wireless%20telegraphy">wireless telegraphy</a> on a large scale and searchlights at night for communication and recognition signals. Immediately after returning to Kiel, the fleet began preparations for the autumn maneuvers, which began on 29 August in the Baltic. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September, where it took part in a major <a href="amphibious%20warfare">landing operation</a>, after which the ships took the ground troops from the <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">IX Corps</a> that participated in the exercises to <a href="Altona%2C%20Hamburg">Altona</a> for a parade for Wilhelm II. The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> on 6 September. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a>, where it participated in further landing operations with the IX Corps and the <a href="Guards%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">Guards Corps</a>. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end. The I Squadron went on its winter training cruise, this time to the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.

"Kaiser Wilhelm II" took part in a pair of training cruises with the I Squadron during 9–19 January and 27 February – 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. The fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, where "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was visited by the Danish King <a href="Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark">Christian IX</a>. The fleet then stopped in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, where "Kaiser Wilhelm II", the battleship , and the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> all ran aground, though only "Friedrich Carl" was seriously damaged. The summer cruise ended on 9 August, though the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> that month. The British fleet stopped in Danzig, <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>, and <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and the main German fleet was anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit was strained by the <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">Anglo-German naval arms race</a>.

As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. During October, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" conducted individual training and, in November, joined the rest of the I Squadron for a cruise in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. While on the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.

"Kaiser Wilhelm II" and the rest of the fleet undertook a heavier training schedule in 1906 than in previous years. The ships were occupied with individual, division and squadron exercises throughout April. Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a> into the Baltic. The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and the I Squadron anchored in Molde, where they were joined on 21 July by Wilhelm II aboard the steamer <a href="USS%20Powhatan%20%28ID-3013%29">SS "Hamburg"</a>. The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">Haakon VII</a> on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland, to join exercises being conducted there. The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22–24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde%20Bay">Eckernförde Bay</a> outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days.

On 26 September 1906, now-"<a href="Gro%C3%9Fadmiral">Großadmiral</a>" (Grand Admiral) von Koester lowered his flag aboard "Kaiser Wilhelm II", ending her tenure as the fleet flagship; the new battleship replaced her in this role. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was now assigned to the I Squadron, where she served as the second command flagship, under "Konteradmiral" <a href="Max%20Rollmann">Max Rollmann</a>. The ship participated in the uneventful winter cruise into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December. The first quarter of 1907 followed the previous pattern and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-designated the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. From the end of May to early June the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea, returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat. This was followed by the regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August, during which "Kaiser Wilhelm II" anchored in <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>. During the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 26 August to 6 September, the fleet conducted landing exercises in northern <a href="Schleswig">Schleswig</a> with the IX Corps. The winter training cruise went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November.
In May 1908, the fleet went on a major cruise into the Atlantic instead of its normal voyage in the North Sea. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" stopped in <a href="Horta%2C%20Azores">Horta</a> in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>. The fleet returned to Kiel on 13 August to prepare for the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 27 August to 7 September. Division exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September. At the conclusion of these maneuvers, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was taken out of service. In 1909–1910, she underwent a major reconstruction in Wilhelmshaven. The superstructure amidships was cut down to reduce top-heaviness, new circular funnels were installed, and the conning tower was enlarged. The <a href="fighting%20top">fighting top</a>s from the masts were removed, and the secondary battery was significantly revised. Four of the 15 cm guns were removed and two 8.8 cm guns were added; most of the 8.8 cm guns were moved from the upper decks into casemates in the <a href="main%20deck">main deck</a>. On 14 October 1910, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was recommissioned for service in the Baltic reserve division. She underwent short sea trials from 21 to 23 October before proceeding to Kiel, where she was based with her four sister ships.

From 3 to 29 April 1911, the ship participated in maneuvers off <a href="R%C3%BCgen">Rügen</a>. Together with the North Sea reserve division, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and her sister ships went on a training cruise to Norway, starting on 8 June. During the visit, she stopped in <a href="Arendal">Arendal</a>, <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a>, and <a href="Odda">Odda</a>. In July, the ship conducted gunnery training near the northern coast of <a href="Holstein">Holstein</a>, followed by training cruises off the coast of <a href="Mecklenburg">Mecklenburg</a>. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" served as the flagship of the III Squadron, which was organized for the autumn maneuvers in August. The III Squadron was attached to the High Seas Fleet for the maneuvers, which lasted from 28 August to 11 September. The following day, the III Squadron was disbanded and "Kaiser Wilhelm II" returned to service with the Baltic reserve division. In February 1912, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was sent to the <a href="Fehmarn%20Belt">Fehmarn Belt</a> to assist in freeing several freighters that were stuck in ice. She and her sisters were again decommissioned on 9 May, and remained out of service until 1914.

As a result of the outbreak of World War I, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914; "Kaiser Wilhelm II" served as the flagship of the squadron. The ships were readied for war very slowly, and they were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August. They were initially tasked with coastal defense, though they served in this capacity for a very short time. In mid-September, the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic, under the command of Prince Heinrich. He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on <a href="Windau">Windau</a>, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, the V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. Before the end of the year, the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic.

Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Pomerania">Bay of Pomerania</a> and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December. The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from front-line service in February 1915. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and her sisters. During this period, her sister briefly served as the squadron flagship, but "Kaiser Wilhelm II" resumed the post starting on 24 February. The following month, on 5 March, her crew was reduced and she steamed to Wilhelmshaven, where she was converted into the headquarters ship for the commander of the High Seas Fleet, commencing on 26 April. The ship had its wireless equipment modernized for use by the commander when the fleet was in port.

After the end of the war, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" continued in her role as headquarters ship for the fleet commander and his staff, along with the commander of the minesweeping operation in the North Sea. She was decommissioned for the last time on 10 September 1920. The naval clauses of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which ended the war, limited the <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a> strength of the re-formed "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>" to eight pre-dreadnought battleships of the and es, of which only six could be operational at any given time. As a result, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" was stricken from the navy list on 17 March 1921 and sold to shipbreakers. By 1922, "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and her sisters had been broken up for scrap metal. The ship's bow ornament ("bugzier") is preserved at the <a href="Military%20History%20Museum%20of%20the%20Bundeswehr">Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr</a> in Dresden.

Chicado V

Chicado V (1950 – ) was a Champion <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse">Quarter Horse</a> race horse foaled (born) in 1950, and considered one of the outstanding <a href="broodmare">broodmare</a>s of her breed. She was bred by <a href="Frank%20%26quot%3BScoop%26quot%3B%20Vessels">Frank Vessels</a> of <a href="Los%20Alamitos%2C%20California">Los Alamitos</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, and trained by Earl Holmes.

Chicado V started only six times because knee problems cut short her racing career. However, she won her first two starts while breaking or equaling track records, and was given the title of co-Champion Quarter Running Two-Year-Old Filly by the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association">American Quarter Horse Association</a> (AQHA) in 1952. The next year she ran her last four races, winning once and setting one more speed record. After her last race, in , she was retired from the track to become a broodmare, and had nine <a href="foal">foal</a>s. Two of her offspring were named Champion Quarter Running Horses, and all her foals had a total of seven <a href="Graded%20stakes%20race">stakes race</a> wins. One of her daughters, Table Tennis, went on to become a noted broodmare herself, as did Table Tennis' daughter Rapid Volley and granddaughter Perks. However, three of Chicado V's sons—Triple Chick, Three Chicks, and The Ole Man—were her best known offspring; all three became leading sires and are the main cause of her fame. She was inducted into the AQHA's <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Hall%20of%20Fame">American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame</a> in 2006.

Chicado V was bred by Frank Vessels of Los Alamitos, California and foaled in 1950. She was a member of the Quarter Horse breed, and the AQHA registered her in their <a href="stud%20book">stud book</a> as number 29,689. She was a daughter of Chicaro Bill out of the broodmare <a href="Do%20Good">Do Good</a>, herself a member of the AQHA Hall of Fame. Chicado V was a full sister to Senor Bill, an outstanding racehorse and breeding stallion, as well as a half-sister to Clabber II and Do Win, two other outstanding racehorses. Chicaro Bill's <a href="Mare">dam</a>, or mother, was a <a href="Mare%20%28horse%29">mare</a> named Verna Grace, who was known as Fair Chance when she raced. Through Chicaro Bill, Chicado V was a descendent of the AQHA Hall of Fame member <a href="Traveler%20%28horse%29">Traveler</a> as well as the <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Racing%20and%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> member <a href="Peter%20Pan%20I">Peter Pan</a>. On her dam's side, she traced to Louisiana Quarter Horse bloodlines as well as to the AQHA Hall of Famer <a href="Peter%20McCue%20%28horse%29">Peter McCue</a>.

When mature, Chicado V stood tall. She was a <a href="Brown%20%28color%29">brown</a> mare, with a connected <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">star, stripe, and snip</a> on her face as her only <a href="Horse%20markings">markings</a>, or identifying marks. Earl Holmes, a longtime trainer who started his racing career as a groom for Vessels, had the care of Chicado V after she was born, and said of her that she "was gentle, real gentle—in everything. She was born broke[n]." When she stood in a <a href="starting%20gate">starting gate</a> for a race, Holmes said she looked like a rabbit, because "she had big ears and that's all you could see, she was so little". She also had a body defect, or <a href="Equine%20conformation">conformation</a> fault, in that she had calf-knees.

Chicado V was sent out for race training as a two-year-old, at first to her owner's trainer, Farrell Jones, who liked neither her calf-knees nor her habit of running poorly in training. She consistently hung behind the other horses in group training runs, and Jones sent her back to Vessels, who then sent her to trainer Eddie Moreno. Moreno finished her training and sent her to the track for her first race, a contest that she won while setting a new track record for a two-year-old of 18.1 seconds. Her performance persuaded Jones to relent, and he took her back to his training barn. Her knees would not allow her to be raced often, and she only started once more as a two-year-old, a race at <a href="Bay%20Meadows%20Racetrack">Bay Meadows Racetrack</a> that she won while equaling the track record of 17.2 seconds for the distance.

After an 11-month break, Chicado V returned to the track as a three-year-old, but her legs continued to create problems. She started four times during her three-year-old year, winning once, with one second and one third place. In her win at Pomona, the site of her first win, she lowered the track record for the distance from 18.1 to 17.9 seconds. Her knees continued to be a problem, and although she never broke down, or became unable to run, she was retired in December 1953.

As a racehorse, Chicado V ran up a record of three wins, one second, and one third, in six starts over two years. She earned a Race Register of Merit in 1952 from the AQHA, the lowest level racing award given by the AQHA, as well as the highest possible <a href="Speed%20index">speed rating</a> of AAAT, a measure of how fast she was able to run. She was a stakes race winner, or winner of a race run by the higher quality horses, and was given the title of co-Champion Quarter Running Two-Year-Old Filly by the AQHA in 1952. Her race earnings were $5,215 (approximately $ as of 2019), although the official race record from the AQHA does not list any stakes wins. Many of the early racing records did not make it into the AQHA's computers, so the lack of stakes wins on the record does not mean that other records recording them are incorrect.

As a broodmare, Chicado V gave birth to nine foals, or babies, between 1955 and 1968, seven <a href="stallion">stallion</a>s and two mares. Seven earned their Race Register of Merit with the AQHA. Four of her foals—Triple Chick, Three Chicks, The Ole Man, and Chicado Chick—were sired by <a href="Three%20Bars">Three Bars (TB)</a>, a member of the AQHA Hall of Fame. Her other five foals were sired by five different stallions, respectively War Bam, Spotted Bull, Anchor Watch, Double Bid, and fellow Hall of Famer <a href="Go%20Man%20Go">Go Man Go</a>. In a 1959 interview, Vessels felt that Chicado V was the best broodmare he owned. Vessels further stated that he "wouldn't part with her" and that he "would be crazy to sell her".

Chicado V's first foal was Triple Chick, who was fathered by Three Bars, a 1955 brown stallion. Triple Chick was unraced, but he remains number 48 on the AQHA's All Time Leading Broodmares Sire List By Winners, a listing of maternal grandsires of race horses arranged by the number of wins their grandget, or grandchildren, have won as of the end of 2007. Her next foal was War Chic, a 1956 <a href="Sorrel%20%28horse%29">sorrel</a> stallion, who was rated AAAT on the racetrack. He was also a <a href="Stakes%20race">stakes winner</a>, and won 12 out of 21 starts with earnings of $35,453 (approximately $ as of 2019). War Chic was named Champion Two-Year Old Colt in 1958. Chicado V's next foal was a mare, named Table Tennis, who won two stakes races, as well as eight other races, out of 35 starts, with an AAAT rating and $35,197 (approximately $ as of 2019). She was named Champion Three Year Old Filly in 1960. Chicado V's fourth foal was Three Chicks, a 1959 brown stallion, and a full sibling to Triple Chick. Three Chicks won two stakes races, along with one other race in ten starts. He was rated AAAT on the track as well as earning an <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Horse%20shows%20and%20rodeos">AQHA Champion award</a> in the show ring after his racing career was over. His total race earnings were $22,625 (approximately $ as of 2019). Three Chicks remains number 42 on the AQHA's All Time Leading Broodmare Sires By Winners.

In 1960, Chicado V foaled Chicado Chick, a <a href="Bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> stallion, another full sibling to Three Chicks and Triple Chick. Chicado Chick started 11 times on the track, winning twice for $1,752 (approximately $ as of 2019) in race earnings along with an AAA speed rating, the second highest speed rating possible at the time. He also earned a Performance Register of Merit and an AQHA Championship from the AQHA as a <a href="Horse%20show">show horse</a> after his racing career was over. The 1961 foal was Anchor Chic, a bay stallion. Anchor Chic started 16 times, with three wins for total earnings of $2,126 (approximately $ as of 2019) and an AAAT speed rating. Chicado V had no foal in 1962, but in 1963, she foaled The Ole Man, a sorrel stallion and another full sibling to Triple Chick, Three Chicks and Chicado Chick. The Ole Man won two stakes races as well as 6 other races in 33 starts. He earned an AAAT speed rating and $20,657 (approximately $ as of 2019) total race winnings. The Ole Man remains number 55 on the All Time Leading Broodmare Sires By Winners. Chicado V's penultimate foal was Successor, a bay stallion who started seven times, but never won a race; he was rated AA on the track. Chicado V's last foal, Alisal, was a 1968 bay mare who never raced.

Chicado V's foals won seven stakes races for a total prize money of $118,107 (approximately $ as of 2019), and two earned AQHA Championships. Table Tennis went on to become an outstanding broodmare herself, foaling Rapid Volley by Three Bars (TB), among others. Rapid Volley produced Perks by <a href="Easy%20Jet%20%28horse%29">Easy Jet</a>. Perks was another outstanding broodmare who continued the maternal family success, but it was as a dam of stallions that Chicado V is best known; three of her sons—Triple Chick, Three Chicks, and The Ole Man—became leading race sires. Triple Chick not only sired race horses, but show horses as well, including Boston Mac and Triple's Image. Three Chicks sired the <a href="All%20American%20Futurity">All American Futurity</a> winner <a href="Three%20Oh%27s">Three Oh's</a> and the racehorse stallion Azure Three. The Ole Man sired 1,876 foals, including 15 stakes winners and 10 AQHA Champions.

Chicado V died in February 1972, while in foal to Alamitos Bar. A stakes race at <a href="Los%20Alamitos%20Race%20Course">Los Alamitos Race Course</a> was named in her honor, starting in 1960. In 2006 she was inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame.

Bobby Gibbes

Robert Henry Maxwell (Bobby) Gibbes, (6 May 1916 – 11 April 2007) was a leading Australian <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> of World War II, and the longest-serving wartime commanding officer of <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron RAAF</a>. He was officially credited with 10¼ aerial victories, although his score is often reported as 12, including two shared. Gibbes was also credited with five aircraft probably destroyed, and a further 16 damaged. He commanded No. 3 Squadron in North Africa from February 1942 to April 1943, apart from a brief period when he was injured.

Born in rural <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, Gibbes worked as a <a href="Jackaroo%20%28trainee%29">jackaroo</a> and salesman before joining the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> in February 1940. Posted to the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20Theatre">Middle East</a> in April 1941, he flew with No. 3 Squadron in the <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria–Lebanon Campaign</a>, and became commanding officer during the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert Campaign</a>, where his leadership and fighting skills earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar</a>. Subsequently posted to the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>, he served with <a href="No.%2080%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 80 Wing</a> of the <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a>, and took part in the "<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>" of April 1945. After the war he spent many years in New Guinea developing local industry, for which he was awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Medal of the Order of Australia</a> in 2004. He continued to fly until the age of 85, and died five years later in 2007.

The only son of Henry and Cora Gibbes, Robert Henry Maxwell (Bobby) Gibbes was born on 6 May 1916 in <a href="Young%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Young</a>, New South Wales. He came from a family that had long been active in the government and military. His great-grandfather, Colonel <a href="John%20George%20Nathaniel%20Gibbes">John George Nathaniel Gibbes</a>, built his residence "Wotonga" at <a href="Kirribilli%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kirribilli</a>; the property was later refurbished to become Sydney's <a href="Admiralty%20House%2C%20Sydney">Admiralty House</a>. Gibbes' grandfather, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes, owned <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Canberra">Yarralumla</a> station, subsequently the official residence of Australia's <a href="Governor-General">Governor-General</a>. His father was a <a href="Station%20%28Australian%20agriculture%29">grazier</a> and his uncle Fred a <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a> pilot in World War I who was killed in action. Gibbes attended <a href="All%20Saints%20College%2C%20Bathurst">All Saints College</a> in <a href="Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bathurst</a>, and various schools in <a href="Manly%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Manly</a>, before earning a living as a <a href="Jackaroo%20%28trainee%29">jackaroo</a>.

Gibbes was working as a salesman when he joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) on 2 February 1940. He exaggerated his height, which was below the minimum requirement, to gain entrance. In a 1990 interview, he related that he had undertaken flying lessons at his own expense prior to enlisting, but "when war was declared, I thought I'd wait for <a href="George%20VI">King George</a> to pay for the rest". He further recalled that he applied to join the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> at the same time, but was still waiting for a response. After completing flying training at <a href="Sydney%20Airport">Mascot</a> and <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">Richmond</a>, New South Wales, and <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, Gibbes was commissioned a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> on 28 June 1940. His initial posting was to <a href="No.%2023%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 23 Squadron</a>, which operated <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s and <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s out of <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Archerfield">Archerfield</a>, Queensland. He was promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> on 26 December 1940.

Two of Gibbes' cousins—both born in 1915 and, like Bobby, only sons—were also pilots in the RAAF. Rodney Gibbes joined the Air Force in July 1936. Peter Gibbes, an airline pilot before the war, enlisted in December 1940. Each earned the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>, Rodney in 1940 for his part in a <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Wellington</a> bomber raid in Europe while serving with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, and Peter in 1942 for his actions flying a Hudson bomber with <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B1%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron RAAF</a> during the <a href="Malayan%20Campaign">Malayan Campaign</a>. Rodney died in action over Italy on 16 May 1943.

In April 1941, Gibbes was posted to the Middle East as <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> of <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B450%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 450 Squadron</a>. The following month he transferred to <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a>, which was flying <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>s. In June, after converting to <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20variants">P-40 Tomahawks</a>, the squadron commenced operations in the <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria–Lebanon Campaign</a>. Gibbes was credited with a probable victory over a <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B88">Junkers Ju 88</a> near <a href="Bierut">Bierut</a> on 13 June. On 11 July he claimed his first "kill", a <a href="Dewoitine%20D.520">Dewoitine D.520</a> fighter of the <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> air force, over <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>. He shared in its destruction with <a href="John%20Francis%20Jackson">John Jackson</a>, after which the pair tossed a coin to take full credit for it, and Gibbes won. In September, No. 3 Squadron transferred to the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert Campaign</a>, where it saw action against German and Italian forces. On 20 November, during <a href="Operation%20Crusader">Operation Crusader</a>, Gibbes took part in the destruction of a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a> with three other pilots, crash landing back at base with damage to his own aircraft. He had a particularly successful day on 25 November, when he shot down two <a href="Fiat%20G.50">Fiat G.50</a>s and damaged three more, as well as a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a>. Five days later he destroyed a G.50 over <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a>. On 22 January 1942, he brought down a <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B87">Junkers Ju 87</a> and damaged two G.50s. He was promoted to acting <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> the same month.

Raised to acting <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, Gibbes was appointed commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron on 26 February 1942. The unit's Tomahawks had by this time been replaced by Kittyhawks, and Gibbes emblazoned his with a cartoon depicting a <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a> kicking a <a href="dachshund">dachshund</a> in the rear. He claimed a Bf 109 (possibly a misidentified <a href="Macchi%20C.202">Macchi C.202</a>) during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">Siege of Tobruk</a> on 7 May. On 26 May, he was shot down while leading an attack on a heavily escorted force of "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" bombers near <a href="Gamal%20Abdul%20El%20Nasser%20Air%20Base">El Adem</a>. After firing at and probably destroying a Bf 109, Gibbes was hit by fire from a Ju 88 and had to <a href="parachute">bail out</a>. Part of his parachute became entangled with the tailplane of his stricken aircraft and he struggled to escape. He broke his ankle in the landing but within six weeks was flying again, his leg still in a cast. Due to his enforced absence, fellow ace <a href="Nicky%20Barr">Nicky Barr</a> was given command of No. 3 Squadron until he himself was shot down and taken prisoner on 26 June, at which point Gibbes again took charge of the unit. Barr later said that although Gibbes was not a brilliant shot, he had the keenest eyesight of any pilot he knew when it came to locating enemy aircraft and alerting his fellows for the attack. Another No. 3 Squadron pilot, Tom Russell, also recalled that Gibbes was particularly adept at finding targets, and that "if we got scattered in a dogfight he had the uncanny ability to get us back into formation in a very short space of time".
Gibbes was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 28 July 1942 for his actions on 26 May, the citation noting his "exceptional skill and gallantry". On 1 September, he destroyed a Bf 109 and damaged two others during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alam%20el%20Halfa">Battle of Alam el Halfa</a>, east of <a href="El%20Alamein">El Alamein</a>. He claimed No. 3 Squadron's 200th victim, a Bf 109F, during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">Battle of El Alamein</a> on 28 October. Air Marshal <a href="Peter%20Roy%20Maxwell%20Drummond">Sir Peter Drummond</a>, Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East</a>, sent him a signal reading "Heartiest congratulations to you and all ranks in the squadron on the achievement of your <a href="Century%20%28cricket%29">double century</a>—<a href="not%20out">not out</a>". Around this time Gibbes also managed to fly Bf 109F and G fighters captured from the Germans, and came away impressed. He was credited with another Bf 109 on 17 November. On 21 December, he landed his Kittyhawk in rugged terrain near <a href="Hun%2C%20Libya">Hun</a>, Libya, to rescue a fellow pilot who had been forced down. Gibbes threw out his own parachute to make room in the <a href="cockpit">cockpit</a> for his passenger and lost part of his <a href="Landing%20gear">undercarriage</a> taking off, necessitating a one-wheeled landing back at base. Recommended for the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for this action, he was instead awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>, which was promulgated on 15 January 1943 and cited his "outstanding qualities of leadership and enthusiasm". Gibbes himself crash landed behind enemy lines on 14 January 1943, walking in the desert before being picked up by a British Army patrol. He was awarded a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his DFC for this feat, and for his "exceptional leadership, skill and courage, contributing in a large measure to the success of the squadron he commands". The award made him the most highly decorated pilot in the RAAF.

On 22 January 1943, Gibbes claimed his last kill, a C.202. He was officially credited with a total of 10¼ victories, though other estimates gave him a score of 12, including two shared. He was also credited with five "probables", and another 16 damaged. During his tour of duty in the Middle East, he flew 274 <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s and became No. 3 Squadron's longest-serving wartime commanding officer. Squadron member Bob Smith recalled him as lacking somewhat in administrative ability, but an "<a href="Errol%20Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>" in the air. Gibbes, for his part, later admitted to being in "an absolute state of terror" before missions, only to "sort of become mechanical" once the shooting started. He described his post-combat feelings thus:

Gibbes handed over command of No. 3 Squadron to Squadron Leader <a href="Brian%20Eaton">Brian Eaton</a> on 19 April 1943. With his rank of squadron leader confirmed the same month, Gibbes departed North Africa to serve at <a href="RAAF%20Overseas%20Headquarters">RAAF Overseas Headquarters</a>, London, until October. While in England he converted to <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a> night fighters and was slated to command <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B464%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 464 Squadron RAAF</a>, but was instead posted back to Australia, via Canada. There, according to Gibbes, he gave a series of morale-building lectures on air combat to <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> students: "So I, you know, went round and lied like hell. I said that it was all a <a href="wikt%3Apiece%20of%20cake%23Noun">piece of cake</a>." In January 1944, he joined <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Training Unit</a> (OTU) at <a href="Mildura%2C%20Victoria">Mildura</a>, Victoria, becoming chief flying instructor in March. He worked with <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a>, Australia's top-scoring ace, to improve the success rate at No. 2 OTU by personally selecting the most promising pilots from local service flying training schools. Gibbes was promoted to temporary <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> on 1 July. In October he was posted to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> in the Northern Territory, flying <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s as <a href="wing%20leader">wing leader</a> of <a href="No.%2080%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 80 Wing</a>. The role made him deputy to Group Captain Caldwell, the wing's commanding officer. Gibbes later suffered burns in a crash landing following engine failure. In December he met, in his own words, "a little dark-haired popsy" named Jeannine Ince, a volunteer with the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> who had nursed him in hospital. They married on 23 January 1945.

No. 80 Wing had begun transferring to the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> in December 1944, and the main body followed in January 1945. Gibbes' injuries prevented him from joining the formation at its base on <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a>, where it came under the control of the <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a> (No. 1 TAF), until 9 March. Once there, he took over as temporary commanding officer for a few days when Caldwell was called to <a href="Manila">Manila</a>. In April, Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots, including Caldwell and fellow aces <a href="Wilfred%20Arthur">Wilf Arthur</a> and <a href="John%20Lloyd%20Waddy">John Waddy</a>, who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground-attack missions. The incident became known as the "<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>". Gibbes later declared that "... after I myself had been operating for a week or so and had a really good look around and seen the futility of the operations which had been given, I could not see any point in carrying on. I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service." As a former jackaroo, he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle: "I felt horrible about it, being an ex <a href="The%20bush">bushy</a> ... at about lunch time I went out and darned if I didn't have to turn butcher. And Heavens, it was butchering too, in every sense of the word. No—not the Japs. Cattle ... If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives, starvation will be our main weapon ... God, I hated doing it but could do nothing else. Felt as sick as hell." No action was taken against the "mutineers" for their attempted resignations; a subsequent government inquiry found that their protest was justified. In the meantime, Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai. Both were reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant; the <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> No. 1 TAF, Air Commodore <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a>, himself shortly to be dismissed over the "mutiny", restored Gibbes to squadron leader effective 23 April.

In July 1945, Gibbes was assigned to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. Following his discharge from the Air Force on 11 January 1946, he was initially employed as a stock and station agent in <a href="Coonamble%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Coonamble</a>, New South Wales. He flew a Butler Bat twin-engined aircraft to facilitate his work, reportedly the only New South Welshman in his profession to do so at the time. Gibbes spent much of the next 30 years in New Guinea, pioneering the island's transport, coffee and hospitality industries. In January 1948, he formed Gibbes Sepik Airways using, among other types, three German <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B52">Junkers Ju 52</a>s, one of which was said to have been the personal transport of senior "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" commander <a href="Albert%20Kesselring">Albert Kesselring</a>. He was joined briefly in this venture, headquartered at <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a>, by Nicky Barr. Gibbes also established a tea and coffee plantation at <a href="Mount%20Hagen">Mount Hagen</a>, New Guinea, in 1950, and served as a member of the RAAF Active Reserve, based in <a href="Townsville%2C%20Queensland">Townsville</a>, Queensland, from 1952 until 1957. In 1958, he sold his share in Gibbes Sepik Airways to Mandated Airlines, which was later bought out by <a href="Ansett%20Australia">Ansett Australia</a>. He continued to develop coffee plantations in New Guinea, and built a large chain of hotels beginning with the Bird of Paradise in <a href="Goroka">Goroka</a>.

Gibbes sold his interests in New Guinea in 1972. He spent most of the remainder of the decade in the Mediterranean, aboard his <a href="catamaran">catamaran</a> "Billabong". In his 60s, he sailed "Billabong" from England to Australia by himself, braving heavy seas and Malaysian pirates along the way. By 1979 he was living in Sydney and had begun building his own twin-engined plane, which he eventually took to the air in 1990. In 1994, Gibbes published his autobiography, "You Live But Once". He continued to fly until forced to give up his <a href="civil%20aviation">civil aviation</a> licence at the age of 85. In 2002, he appeared in an episode of the television series "<a href="Australian%20Story">Australian Story</a>" dedicated to Nicky Barr. Gibbes was awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Medal of the Order of Australia</a> on <a href="Australia%20Day">26 January</a> 2004 for "service to aviation and to tourism, particularly in Papua New Guinea". He died of a stroke at <a href="Mona%20Vale%20Hospital">Mona Vale Hospital</a> in Sydney on 11 April 2007, aged 90, and was survived by his wife and two daughters. His funeral service at St Thomas' Church, <a href="North%20Sydney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">North Sydney</a>, was attended by 350 mourners, including the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of Air Force</a>, Air Marshal <a href="Geoff%20Shepherd">Geoff Shepherd</a>, and 40 members of No. 3 Squadron led by the commanding officer. A Spitfire in the "<a href="Grey%20nurse%20shark">Grey Nurse</a>" <a href="livery">livery</a> of one of Gibbes' World War II aircraft overflew the church, along with four <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a> jet fighters from No. 3 Squadron in a "<a href="Missing%20man%20formation">missing man</a>" formation.

Carlson's patrol

Carlson's patrol, also known as The Long Patrol or Carlson's long patrol, was an operation by the <a href="Marine%20Raiders">2nd Marine Raider Battalion</a> under the command of <a href="Evans%20Carlson">Evans Carlson</a> during the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a> against the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> from 6 November to 4 December 1942. In the operation, the 2nd Raiders attacked forces under the command of <a href="Toshinari%20Sh%C5%8Dji">Toshinari Shōji</a>, which were <a href="Koli%20Point%20action">escaping</a> from an attempted encirclement in the <a href="Koli%20Point">Koli Point</a> area on <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> and attempting to rejoin other Japanese army units on the opposite side of the U.S. Lunga perimeter.

In a series of small unit engagements over 29 days, the 2nd Raiders killed almost 500 Japanese soldiers while suffering only 16 killed, although many were afflicted by disease. The raiders also captured a Japanese field gun that was delivering harassing fire on <a href="Henderson%20Field%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Henderson Field</a>, the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> airfield at <a href="Lunga%20Point">Lunga Point</a> on Guadalcanal.

On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily <a href="United%20States">U.S.</a> <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marines</a>) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida%20Islands">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. Their mission was to deny the Japanese use of the islands as <a href="Military%20base">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="materiel">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, and to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="Military%20campaign">campaign</a> to isolate the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings initiated the six-month-long <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a>.

The Japanese were taken by surprise, and by nightfall on 8 August the 11,000 Allied troops—under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Alexander%20Vandegrift">Alexander Vandegrift</a>—<a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">secured Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands as well as an airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal. The Allies later renamed the airfield Henderson Field. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months later increased the number of U.S. troops at Lunga Point to more than 20,000.

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's 17th Army—a <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant-General <a href="Harukichi%20Hyakutake">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>—with the task of retaking Guadalcanal. Units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal on 19 August to drive Allied forces from the island.
The first Japanese attempt to recapture Henderson Field failed when a 917-man force was defeated on 21 August in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Tenaru">Battle of the Tenaru</a>. The next attempt took place from 12–14 September, ending in the defeat of the <a href="Kawaguchi%20Detachment">6,000 soldiers</a> under the command of Major General <a href="Kiyotake%20Kawaguchi">Kiyotake Kawaguchi</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edson%27s%20Ridge">Battle of Edson's Ridge</a>. Kawaguchi and the surviving Japanese troops then regrouped west of the <a href="Matanikau%20River">Matanikau River</a> on Guadalcanal.

Between 1 and 17 October, the Japanese delivered 15,000 troops to Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive. After his staff officers observed the American defenses around Lunga Point, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field. His 2nd Division (augmented by troops from the <a href="38th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">38th Division</a>), under Lieutenant General <a href="Masao%20Maruyama%20%28Japanese%20Army%20officer%29">Masao Maruyama</a> was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defenses from the south near the east bank of the <a href="Lunga%20River%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Lunga River</a>. The 7000-member 2nd Division was split into three units; the Left Wing Unit under Major General <a href="Yumio%20Nasu">Yumio Nasu</a> containing the 29th Infantry Regiment, the Right Wing Unit under Kawaguchi consisting of troops from the 230th Infantry Regiment (from the 38th Infantry Division), and the division reserve led by Maruyama comprising the 16th Infantry Regiment.
On 23 October, Maruyama's forces struggled through the jungle to reach the American lines. Kawaguchi—on his own initiative—began to shift his right wing unit to the east, believing that the American defenses were weaker in that area. Maruyama, through one of his staff officers, ordered Kawaguchi to keep to the original attack plan. When he refused, Kawaguchi was relieved of command and replaced by Colonel <a href="Toshinari%20Sh%C5%8Dji">Toshinari Shōji</a>, commander of the 230th Infantry Regiment. That evening, after learning that the left and right wing forces were still struggling to reach the American lines, Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19:00 on 24 October. The Americans remained completely unaware of the approach of Maruyama's forces.

Finally, late on 24 October, Maruyama's forces reached the U.S. Lunga perimeter. Over two consecutive nights Maruyama's forces conducted numerous unsuccessful frontal assaults on positions defended by troops of the <a href="1st%20Battalion%207th%20Marines">1st Battalion, 7th Marines</a> (1/7) under Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Chesty%20Puller">Chesty Puller</a> and the U.S. Army's 3rd Battalion, <a href="164th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">164th Infantry Regiment</a>, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall. U.S. Marine and Army rifle, machine gun, mortar, artillery and direct canister fire from anti-tank guns "wrought terrible carnage" on the Japanese. More than 1,500 of Maruyama's troops were killed in the attacks while the Americans lost about 60 killed. Shōji's right wing units did not participate in the attacks, choosing to remain in place to cover Nasu's right flank against a possible attack in that area by U.S. forces that never materialized.

At 08:00 on 26 October, Hyakutake called off further attacks and ordered his forces to retreat. Maruyama's left wing and division reserve survivors were ordered to retreat back to the Matanikau River area while the right wing unit under Shōji was told to head for Koli Point, east of the Lunga River. Shōji and his troops began arriving at Koli Point on November 3.

At 05:30 on 4 November, two companies from the <a href="Marine%20Raiders">2nd Marine Raider</a> Battalion—commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Evans%20Carlson">Evans Carlson</a>, landed by boat at Aola Bay, east of Lunga Point. Carlson's raiders—along with troops from the U.S. Army's 147th Infantry Regiment—were to provide security for 500 <a href="Seabee%20%28US%20Navy%29">Seabees</a> as they attempted to construct an airfield. The Aola Bay airfield construction effort had been approved by <a href="William%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William Halsey, Jr.</a>—commander of Allied forces in the south Pacific area—acting on a recommendation by Rear Admiral <a href="Richmond%20K.%20Turner">Richmond K. Turner</a>, U.S. naval commander of amphibious forces for the south Pacific.

The 2nd Marine Raider Battalion was a unique unit in the Marine Corps. The battalion's original organization and tactics were based around <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20China">Communist Chinese</a> precepts Carlson had witnessed while serving as an observer with the Communists during the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> in 1937-1938. These precepts included promoting equality between officers and enlisted men and making decisions through collective consensus. Unlike the 1st Marine Raider Battalion, which focused on <a href="commando">commando</a> tactics, the 2nd Battalion trained to operate as a <a href="Guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla</a> force. The training included an emphasis on infiltration tactics and often involved tactical exercises conducted at night. The battalion was organized into six self-contained rifle companies and a headquarters company. Before landing at Guadalcanal elements of the battalion had seen action as part of the garrison of <a href="Midway%20Atoll">Midway Atoll</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> in May 1942 and the near disastrous <a href="Makin%20Island%20raid">Makin Island raid</a> in August.

In early November, Vandegrift, fearing that the Japanese were planning an assault on the Lunga perimeter from the east using Shōji's forces plus additional reinforcements, launched an operation against the Japanese units at Koli Point. Beginning on 4 November, two battalions of U.S. Marines and two battalions of U.S. Army troops <a href="Koli%20Point%20action">attacked and attempted to encircle</a> Shōji's men at Gavaga Creek near the village of Tetere in the Koli Point area.

As the American troops were attempting to destroy Shōji's force, Vandegrift ordered Carlson's raiders to march overland from Aola Bay toward Koli Point to cut off any of Shōji's forces that escaped the encirclement attempt. On 5 November, two transport ships headed for <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a> to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies already on Guadalcanal to march overland towards Koli Point. Carlson arranged for rear echelon personnel at Aola to resupply his patrol with rations every four days at a prearranged point on the coast. A patrol with native carriers would meet the boat and manpack the supplies inland to Carlson's patrol base.

At first light on 6 November, Carlson and his command group, two of his companies, and a group of native scouts and carriers commanded by <a href="Major">Major</a> John Mather of the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> and Sergeant Major <a href="Jacob%20C.%20Vouza">Jacob C. Vouza</a> of the Solomon Islands Police Force set out from Aola on the patrol. The group marched along a jungle trail northwest to the Reko River, arriving on 7 November. At the Reko, Carlson learned that the local Christian mission had recently been raided by Japanese troops who had killed two of the missionaries before moving west. Pushing across the river with one platoon of troops, Carlson encountered a small group of Japanese who shot and severely wounded the native scout leading the Marine column. Returning fire, the Marines killed two Japanese soldiers and drove off another three or four. Carlson's main body then arrived and the column bivouacked for the night.

On 8 November, the column continued through the jungle to the northwest, striking the coast at the Kena River, and made camp at the village of Tasimboko, from Aola Bay. The next day they crossed the Berande and Balasuna rivers and reached the village of Binu— southwest of Tasimboko—in the afternoon. At Binu, about southeast of Koli Point, Carlson established his base camp and prepared to block the movement of any Japanese forces from Koli to the east and south.

The other three raider companies arrived at Aola on 8 November. On 9 November, they moved by landing craft to Tasimboko and, on 10 November marched overland—guided by native scouts—toward Binu. On the way, the raiders encountered a small group of Japanese soldiers and killed three of them before arriving at Binu in the afternoon of the same day.

In the meantime, Hyakutake ordered Shōji to abandon his positions at Koli and rejoin Japanese forces at Kokumbona in the Matanikau area. Although American forces had almost completely encircled Shōji's troops along Gavaga Creek at Koli, a gap existed by way of a swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines. Taking advantage of this route, Shōji's men began to escape. The Americans closed the gap in their lines on 11 November, but by then Shōji and between 2,000 and 3,000 of his men had escaped into the jungle to the south.

On 11 November, Carlson sent four of his battalion's companies—"C", "D", "E", and "F"—to fan out and patrol the area to the north and west of Binu. The remaining company, "B", stayed behind to provide security for the Binu base camp. At 10:00, Company C, which had marched directly west toward the village of Asamana, encountered a large body of Shōji's troops camped near the Metapona River and were quickly pinned down by rifle, machinegun, and mortar fire. Carlson responded by directing Companies D and E to come to C's aid, attacking the Japanese forces from two different directions.
As Companies D and E moved in C's direction, both encountered large concentrations of Shōji's soldiers and, by 12:30, were involved in intense firefights. At 15:00, Company D commander Captain Charles McAuliffe—with nine of his men—unexpectedly marched into the Binu base camp. McAuliffe reported to Carlson that soon after he had made contact with the Japanese forces, he and one of his squads had become cut off from the rest of his company. After extricating themselves with difficulty, McAuliffe and the men with him had decided to retreat back to the base camp. McAuliffe reported that, as far as he knew, the rest of his company had been annihilated. A short time later, however, the rest of D Company arrived at the base camp, led by Gunnery Sergeant George Schrier, after successfully disengaging from the firefight. Carlson summarily relieved McAuliffe for what he later described as "total ineptitude for leadership in battle" and placed Captain Joe Griffith in command of Company D.

Along with Company F, which had returned to the base camp, Carlson proceeded to the area where Company C was engaged, arriving at 16:30. Carlson ordered Company F to attack the Japanese positions facing Company C at 17:15. In the meantime, the Japanese troops departed the area, which Company F soon confirmed. Leaving Company F at the scene, Carlson returned to Binu with Company C, arriving at 22:00. Company E arrived at Binu about the same time and reported that they had caught a Japanese company crossing a river in the open and killed many of them before withdrawing. Carlson then took Company B and returned to the area that Company F was guarding, arriving at daybreak on 12 November. The Marines had suffered 10 killed in the day's actions and estimated that they had killed 120 Japanese soldiers.

Carlson and the two companies, with Company B leading, marched west towards the village of Asamana on the Metapona River. While crossing the river, the Marines captured two Japanese soldiers and killed a third who happened by in a native boat, then attacked and occupied Asamana, surprising and killing several Japanese soldiers in the village. Signs in Japanese in the village indicated that it was being used as a rallying location for Shōji's forces. Occupying defensive positions around the village and river crossing, the raiders killed 25 Japanese soldiers that approached the village during the remainder of the day.
The next day, when a company-sized column of Japanese soldiers approached Asamana, the raiders called in <a href="M116%20howitzer"></a> artillery fire from the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2010th%20Marines">1st Battalion, 10th Marine Regiment</a>, killing many of the Japanese and causing the rest to scatter and retreat away from the village. Carlson and the Marines with him returned to Binu on 14 November to rest and reprovision. In the same day, a patrol from the raiders Company F wiped out a 15-man Japanese encampment discovered by the native scouts.

On 15 November, Carlson's battalion changed their base camp from Binu to Asamana. By this time, however, Shōji's units were no longer in the area, having continued their march deep into the interior of Guadalcanal en route to the Matanikau. Raider patrols around Asamana over the next two days found and killed a few scattered Japanese stragglers.

Carlson's battalion was ordered to move to the upper <a href="Tenaru%20River">Tenaru River</a> and patrol around the Lunga River—south of the Lunga perimeter—to locate the trail the Japanese had used to position their men and materiel for their assaults during the Battle for Henderson Field. Carlson's raiders were also to seek out and destroy several Japanese artillery pieces that had been delivering harassing fire against Henderson Field for several weeks. The raiders set up the new base camp about southeast of the Lunga perimeter on 20 November and rested and replenished until 24 November.

On 25 November, Carlson's Company A arrived from Espiritu Santo and joined the raiders. On 27 November, the battalion relocated further up the Tenaru River and established two auxiliary patrol bases upstream and downstream, respectively.
On 28 November, Companies B and D patrolled across the Lunga River and bivouacked in the Mount Austen area, southwest of the Lunga perimeter. The same day, Companies A and F patrolled further south between the Lunga and the Tenaru. On 30 November, the raiders found a Japanese <a href="Type%2041%2075%20mm%20Mountain%20Gun">75 mm mountain gun</a> and <a href="Type%201%2037%20mm%20Anti-Tank%20Gun">anti-tank gun</a> emplaced on a ridge about south of the Lunga perimeter. As one squad of six Marines from Company F patrolled near where the guns were discovered, they entered a hidden Japanese camp and found themselves among about 100 Japanese soldiers resting under shelters with their weapons stacked around trees in the center of the camp. In the resulting melee, the raider squad killed about 75 of the Japanese. The rest escaped.

The raiders rested on 1 December and received some provisions by airdrop. On 2 December, Carlson fanned out his patrols around the Lunga River. Company B discovered 10 Japanese camped by the river and killed all of them. None of the other companies encountered any Japanese, but one discovered another 75 mm mountain gun. Late in the day, Carlson received orders to terminate the patrol and take his troops into the Lunga perimeter the next day.

On 3 December, Carlson sent Companies C, D, and E east towards the Tenaru river while Companies A, B, and F headed west towards Mount Austen. Companies C, D, and E reached the lower Tenaru and entered friendly lines at Lunga Point without incident. Companies A, B, and F, however, encountered a Japanese patrol near the summit of Mount Austen. In a close-quarters fight in the jungle, 25 Japanese were killed and four Marines were seriously wounded, one of whom died later.

The next day, Companies A, B, and F set out with the intention of entering the Lunga perimeter near the Matanikau River. Along the way, the Marine column was ambushed by a Japanese machinegun team that killed four raiders. Seven Japanese were killed in this skirmish. The patrol encountered no further opposition and entered friendly lines at Lunga Point by mid-afternoon.

As Carlson's battalion was ending its patrol, Shōji and his surviving troops were reaching friendly positions west of the Matanikau. In addition to the losses sustained from attacks by Carlson's raiders, a lack of food and tropical diseases felled many more of Shōji's men. By the time Shōji's forces reached the Lunga River in mid-November, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300 men remained with the main body. When Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700-800 survivors were still with him. Survivors from Shōji's force later participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mount%20Austen%2C%20the%20Galloping%20Horse%2C%20and%20the%20Sea%20Horse">Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse</a> in December 1942 and January 1943.

During the 29 days of the patrol, Carlson's raiders hiked approximately to cover a straight-line distance of about from Aola Bay to the Matanikau River. Carlson claimed that his troops killed 488 Japanese soldiers and captured or destroyed large amounts of equipment, including two howitzers and various small arms and ammunition.

The 2nd Raiders suffered 16 killed and 17 wounded (plus 2 wounded native guides). Non-battle casualties totaled 225, of which 125 suffered from <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, 29 from <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, and 71 from <a href="ringworm">ringworm</a> or <a href="Tropical%20ulcer">jungle rot</a>. Most of the remaining raiders were also suffering some type of physical ailment. On 17 December, the raiders departed Guadalcanal by ship and arrived back at their home camp on Espiritu Santo on 20 December. At Espiritu Santo, the unit continued to be affected by the lingering tropical diseases many had contracted during the Guadalcanal patrol. In the second week of March 1943, the 2nd Raiders were declared unfit for combat duty, although this finding was never announced in an official document. The 2nd Marine Raiders did not participate as a unit in a combat operation until the <a href="Bougainville%20campaign%20%281943%E2%80%9345%29">Bougainville campaign</a> beginning on 1 November 1943. In spite of the high fallout from disease, Carlson's troops generally felt that they had performed well as a unit during the patrol and had accomplished their mission. Cleland E. Early—a lieutenant in Carlson's Company E—described the long Guadalcanal patrol and the effect on his unit: "Enduring the living conditions was worse than the combat. My platoon went in with 30 men, one corpsman and one officer. When we came out we had one officer, one corpsman, and 18 enlisted, all of whom had malaria, worms, diarrhea, jungle rot and high morale.

SMS "Kaiser Barbarossa" (His Majesty's Ship "<a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Barbarossa</a>") was a <a href="German%20Empire">German</a> <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a> of the . The ship was built for the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Imperial Navy</a>, which had begun a program of expansion at the direction of <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>. Construction took place at <a href="Schichau-Werke">Schichau</a>, in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>. "Kaiser Barbarossa" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> in August 1898, <a href="ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> on 21 April 1900, and commissioned in June 1901, at the cost of 20,301,000 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">marks</a>. The ship was armed with a main battery of four guns inside of two twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s.

"Kaiser Barbarossa" served with the German navy from her commissioning in 1901, though her active career was limited by two lengthy stays in dry dock. The first was for repairs following damage to her <a href="rudder">rudder</a> in 1903, which lasted until early 1905, and the second for a major modernization, which began immediately after the conclusion of repair work in 1905 and lasted until late 1907. She returned to service for another two years, before being decommissioned in 1909 and placed in the Reserve Division. She continued to participate in fleet training exercises for the next three years.

Following the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August 1914, "Kaiser Barbarossa" and her <a href="sister%20ship">sisters</a> were mobilized as <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a>s in the V Battle Squadron and assigned to the <a href="North%20Sea">North</a> and <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>s. She saw no combat during the war and, due to a shortage of crews, the ships were withdrawn from active duty in February 1915 and relegated to secondary duties. "Kaiser Barbarossa" was briefly used as a torpedo <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a> for most of 1915 and thereafter spent the remainder of the war as a <a href="prison%20ship">prison ship</a> in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>. Following the end of the war in 1918, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was decommissioned and sold for scrap metal. The ship was <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> in 1919–20.

After the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The Secretary of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office), "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hollmann">Friedrich von Hollmann</a> struggled throughout the early- and mid-1890s to secure parliamentary approval for the s, but in June 1897, Hollmann was replaced by "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" (Rear Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>, who quickly proposed and secured approval for the first <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Naval Law</a> in early 1898. The law authorized the last two ships of the class, "Kaiser Barbarossa" and .

"Kaiser Barbarossa" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward and aft. She displaced up to at full load. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple-expansion%20engine">triple-expansion</a> <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a>s, each driving one <a href="Propeller%23Screw%20propellers">screw propeller</a>. Steam was provided by four <a href="Thornycroft%20boiler">Thornycroft boiler</a>s and eight cylindrical boilers, all of which burned coal. "Kaiser Barbarossa"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . The ship had a cruising radius of at a speed of . She had a normal crew of 39 officers and 612 enlisted men.

The ship's armament consisted of a main battery of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40 guns</a>, <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">twelve 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns</a> all mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s, and twelve <a href="3.7%20cm%20Maxim%20machine%20cannon">machine cannon</a> in single mounts. The armament suite was rounded out with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all in above-water swivel mounts. The ship's <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was thick, and the deck was thick. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> and main battery turrets were protected with of armor plating, and the secondary casemates received of armor protection.

<a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>, the Emperor of Germany, believed that a strong navy was necessary for the country to expand its influence outside continental Europe. As a result, he initiated a program of naval expansion in the late 1880s; the first battleships built under this program were the four "Brandenburg"-class ships. These were immediately followed by the five "Kaiser Friedrich III"-class battleships, of which "Kaiser Barbarossa" was a member. "Kaiser Barbarossa"s keel was laid down on 3 August 1898, at the <a href="Schichau-Werke">Schichau-Werke</a> in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>, under construction number 640. She was ordered under the contract name "A" as an addition to the fleet. "Kaiser Barbarossa" was launched on 21 April 1900. The then-"Vizeadmiral" Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt", gave the launching speech, and the new battleship was christened by Princess <a href="Princess%20Louise%20Sophie%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg">Luise Sofie of Prussia</a>, Wilhelm II's sister-in-law. <a href="Sea%20trials">Sea trials</a> began on 4 May 1901, during which two tests were recorded: a 50-hour endurance test and a 6-hour speed test. The former produced a sustained speed of , while the latter saw a maximum speed of , and on 10 June she was commissioned into the fleet in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. The final cost of the vessel was 20,301,000 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">marks</a>.

Following her commissioning, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was assigned to the I Squadron of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet), which shortly thereafter went on a cruise to Spain. While moored in <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>, the ships met the four "Brandenburg"-class ships, which were returning from their expedition to suppress the <a href="Boxer%20Rebellion">Boxer Rebellion</a> in China. From 22 August to 21 September, "Kaiser Barbarossa" participated in the annual autumn maneuvers of the entire fleet. While in the <a href="Danzig%20Bay">Danzig Bay</a>, the fleet conducted a naval review for the visiting Tsar <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a>, whose wife <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Alexandra</a> was Wilhelm's cousin. The winter cruise in December went to southern Norway. In April and May 1902, the squadron went on a training cruise to Britain, followed by a tour of the <a href="Kiel%20Week">Kiel Week</a> sailing <a href="regatta">regatta</a> in late June. The ships then took part in another training cruise to Norway in July and then the autumn maneuvers, which began in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the <a href="Jade%20Bay">Jade</a>. During the exercise, which lasted from 17 August to 18 September, "Kaiser Barbarossa" and the rest of I Squadron were assigned to play the roles of both the German fleet and <a href="opfor">hostile forces</a>. The usual winter cruise went to <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a>, Norway, that year.

In 1903 the fleet, which was composed of only one squadron of modern battleships, was reorganized as the "Active Battle Fleet". "Kaiser Barbarossa" remained in the I Squadron along with her sister ships and the newest s, while the older "Brandenburg"-class ships were placed in reserve in order to be rebuilt. The first quarter of 1903 followed the usual pattern of training exercises. The squadron went on a training cruise in the Baltic, followed by a voyage to Spain that lasted from 7 May to 10 June. The ship suffered some damage to her rudder, which necessitated temporary repairs at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel from the end of July to 21 August. She thereafter took part in the autumn maneuvers and the winter cruise in the eastern Baltic and the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a>. The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea, a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September, and finally a mock attack on Kiel. The exercises concluded on 12 September. The winter training cruise began on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and continued into the Skagerrak in early December. On 15 December, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was decommissioned for permanent repairs to her rudder, which lasted until January 1905. When the repairs were finished, she did not return to service, however, and instead began a major reconstruction.

During the modernization, four of her 15 cm guns were removed and two 8.8 cm guns were added. All twelve 1-pounder guns were removed, as was the ship's stern-mounted torpedo tube. "Kaiser Barbarossa"s superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship's tendency to roll excessively and her military masts were replaced with lighter pole masts. The ship's funnels were also lengthened. "Kaiser Barbarossa"s modernization was completed by 1 October 1907, when she was recommissioned for service. By that time, the newest s were coming into service; along with the s, these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons. Consequently, the "Heimatflotte" was renamed the "Hochseeflotte" (<a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>). "Kaiser Barbarossa" returned to her place in the I Squadron and she participated in the normal routine of divisional, squadron, and fleet maneuvers and cruises without incident over the next year. The summer fleet cruise in May that year went to the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> and returned to Kiel on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers lasted from 27 August to 7 September. Divisional exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September.

On 17 September 1909, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was decommissioned and assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic Sea. By that time, the new <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s, which rendered "Kaiser Barbarossa" and her sister ships thoroughly obsolete, were beginning to come into service with the fleet. In early 1910, "Kaiser Barbarossa" was assigned to the Training Squadron, which operated in the Baltic in April. She was reactivated to participate in the autumn maneuvers that year in the provisional III Squadron; after the conclusion of the exercises on 10 September, she was placed back in reserve. More modernization work was done at the "Kaiserliche Werft" in Kiel. From 31 July to 15 September, she was reactivated again to take part in the autumn maneuvers in the III Squadron. She thereafter returned to the Reserve Division in early 1912.

As a result of the outbreak of World War I, "Kaiser Barbarossa" and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914. The ships were prepared for war very slowly, and they were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August. They were initially tasked with coastal defense, though they served in this capacity for a very short time. In mid-September, the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic, under the command of <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281862%E2%80%931929%29">Prince Heinrich</a>. He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on <a href="Windau">Windau</a>, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, the V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Kaiser Barbarossa" and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. Before the end of the year, the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic.

After returning to the Baltic, Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Pomerania">Bay of Pomerania</a> and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December. The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from frontline service in February 1915. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of "Kaiser Barbarossa" and her sisters. Her crew was reduced on 5 March, only to be replaced on 11 April so the ship could be used as a torpedo <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a>; this service lasted until 9 November. Ten days later, she was decommissioned for the last time, and in 1916 she was disarmed. "Kaiser Barbarossa" was thereafter employed as a floating prison for <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> in Wilhelmshaven. In November 1918, Germany sought an end to the war and signed the <a href="First%20Armistice%20at%20Compi%C3%A8gne">First Armistice at Compiègne</a>, which temporarily ended hostilities so a peace treaty could be negotiated. Under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which formally ended the war and was signed on 28 June 1919, Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the ""Deutschland" or types". Accordingly, the ship was struck from the naval list on 6 December 1919 and sold to <a href="ship%20breaking">ship breakers</a>. "Kaiser Barbarossa" was broken up for scrap metal in <a href="R%C3%BCstringen">Rüstringen</a> in 1919 and 1920.

Operation Passage to Freedom

Operation Passage to Freedom was a term used by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> to describe its assistance in transporting in 1954–55 310,000 <a href="Vietnamese%20people">Vietnamese</a> civilians, soldiers and non-Vietnamese members of the French Army from communist <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> (the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Democratic Republic of Vietnam</a>) to <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> (the <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a>, later to become the <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Republic of Vietnam</a>). The French and other countries may have transported a further 500,000. In the wake of the French defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu">Battle of Dien Bien Phu</a>, the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">Geneva Accords of 1954</a> decided the fate of <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a> after <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">eight years of war</a> between <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a> forces and the <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a>, which sought <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>ese independence. The accords resulted in the <a href="partition%20of%20Vietnam">partition of Vietnam</a> at the <a href="17th%20parallel%20north">17th parallel north</a>, with <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a>'s communist Viet Minh in control of the north and the French-backed State of Vietnam in the south. The agreements allowed a 300-day period of grace, ending on May 18, 1955, in which people could move freely between the two Vietnams before the border was sealed. The partition was intended to be temporary, pending elections in 1956 to reunify the country under a national government. Between 600,000 and one million northerners moved south, including more than 200,000 French citizens and soldiers in the French army while between 14,000 - 45,000 civilians and approximately 100,000 Viet Minh fighters moved in the opposite direction.

The mass emigration of northerners was facilitated primarily by the <a href="French%20Air%20Force">French Air Force</a> and <a href="French%20Navy">Navy</a>. American naval vessels supplemented the French in evacuating northerners to <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>, the southern capital. The operation was accompanied by a large humanitarian relief effort, bankrolled in the main by the United States government in an attempt to absorb a large tent city of refugees that had sprung up outside Saigon. For the US, the migration was a public relations coup, generating wide coverage of the flight of Vietnamese from the perceived oppression of communism to the "free world" in the south. The period was marked by a <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>-backed propaganda campaign on behalf of South Vietnam's <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Prime Minister <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Diem">Ngo Dinh Diem</a>. The campaign exhorted Catholics to flee impending religious persecution under communism, and around 60% of the north's 1 million Catholics obliged.

At the end of World War II, the <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> had <a href="Vietnamese%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">proclaimed independence</a> under the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Democratic Republic of Vietnam</a> (DRV) in September 1945. This occurred after the withdrawal of <a href="Imperial%20Japan">Imperial Japan</a>, which had seized control of the French colony during World War II. The military struggle started in November 1946 when France attempted to reassert control over <a href="French%20Indochina">Indochina</a> with an attack on the northern port city of <a href="Haiphong">Haiphong</a>. The DRV was recognised by the Soviet Union and the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> (PRC). On the other hand, the western powers recognised the French-backed <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a>, nominally led by Emperor <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bảo Đại</a>, but with a French-trained <a href="Vietnamese%20National%20Army">Vietnamese National Army</a> (VNA) which was loyal to the <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a> forces. In May 1954, after eight years of fighting, the French were surrounded and defeated in a mountainous northern fortress at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu">Battle of Dien Bien Phu</a>. France's withdrawal from Indochina was finalised in the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">Geneva Accords</a> of July 1954, after two months of negotiations between Ho's DRV, France, the PRC and the Soviet Union. Under the terms of the agreement, Vietnam was temporarily divided at the <a href="17th%20parallel%20north">17th parallel north</a> pending elections in 1956 to choose a national government that would administer a reunified country. The communist Viet Minh were left in control of North Vietnam, while the State of Vietnam controlled the south. French Union forces would gradually withdraw from Vietnam as the situation stabilised. Both Vietnamese sides were unsatisfied with the outcome at Geneva; <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Diem">Ngo Dinh Diem</a>, Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam, denounced France's agreement and ordered his delegation not to sign. He stated "We cannot recognise the seizure by Soviet China . . . of over half of our national territory" and that "We can neither concur in the brutal enslavement of millions of compatriots". North Vietnamese Prime Minister <a href="Ph%E1%BA%A1m%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng">Phạm Văn Đồng</a> expressed bitterness after his Soviet and Chinese backers threatened to cut support if he did not agree to the peace terms; Dong had wanted to press home the Viet Minh's military advantage so they could lay claim to more territory at the negotiating table.

Under the accords, there was to be a 300-day period in which free civilian movement was allowed between the two zones, whereas military forces were compelled to relocate to their respective sides. All <a href="French%20Far%20East%20Expeditionary%20Corps">French Far East Expeditionary Corps</a> and VNA forces in the north were to be evacuated south of the 17th parallel, while all Viet Minh fighters had to relocate to the north. The accords stipulated that civilians were to be given the opportunity to move to their preferred half of Vietnam. Article 14(d) of the accords stated that:

Article 14(d) allowed for a 300-day period of free movement between the two Vietnams, ending on May 18, 1955. The parties had given little thought to the logistics of the population resettlement during the negotiations at Geneva, and assumed the matter would be minor. Despite claiming that his northern compatriots had been "enslaved", Diem expected no more than 10,000 refugees. General <a href="Paul%20Ely">Paul Ely</a>, the French Commissioner-General of Indochina, expected that around 30,000 landlords and business executives would move south and proclaimed that he would take responsibility for transporting any Vietnamese who wanted to move to territory controlled by the French Union, such as South Vietnam. <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20France">French Prime Minister</a> <a href="Pierre%20Mend%C3%A8s%20France">Pierre Mendès France</a> and his government had planned to provide aid for around 50,000 displaced persons. Mendes-France was sure that the FFEEC would be able to handle the work all by itself. The Americans saw the period as an opportunity to weaken the communist north.

The predictions made by Diem and Ely were extremely inaccurate. There had been heavy fighting in northern Vietnam, where the Vietminh were at their strongest, and many people had been forced to abandon their homes. Although French charities had been operating in the north, the refugee camps were disorganised and were able to provide little more than shelter. As a result, there was a great number of northerners who wanted to leave and start a new life in the south.

The French started their evacuation with their pre-conceived notion that few would want to head south. As knowledge of the migration program spread through the communist-controlled north, thousands of predominantly northern Catholic asylum-seekers descended on the capital <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> and the port of <a href="Haiphong">Haiphong</a>, both of which were still in French control. This led to anarchy and confusion as the emigrants fought over limited shelter, food, medicine and places on the ships and planes that were bound for the south. By early August, there were over 200,000 evacuees waiting in Hanoi and Haiphong. Initially the ad hoc camps had insufficient sanitation and water quality control, leading to the possibility of outbreaks of disease. Some American representatives said that they were the worst conditions they had seen. The conditions continued to be poor and chaotic after the evacuation got into full swing, and did not improve significantly for a month. There was no organization infrastructure as far as registration or medical records and immunisation of the waiting evacuees. The communists thus sent their propaganda activists through the camps and said that the lack of organisation proved that life for prospective refugees would be even worse in the south, where they would be completely under the control of South Vietnam.

The <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> and <a href="French%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a> had been depleted during World War II. They were unable to deal with the unexpectedly large number of refugees. This was exacerbated by their unwillingness to allow civilian evacuees to travel on trains from outlying districts to Hanoi and Haiphong, as their priority was evacuating their military personnel and equipment. France asked Washington for assistance, so the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">US Department of Defense</a> ordered the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">US Navy</a> to mobilise an evacuation task force.

The American government saw the evacuation as an opportunity to weaken the communists by providing for and thereby winning the loyalty of the refugees to the anti-communist cause. The <a href="United%20States%20Operation%20Mission">United States Operation Mission</a> proposed that aside from helping to evacuate refugees to the south and thereby draining the communist population base, the Americans should provide healthcare, shelter, food and clothing in order to help the anti-communists win the fidelity of their compatriots. Another benefit of participating in the evacuation was that American personnel would be on the ground in North Vietnam, allowing them to gather intelligence on communist activities.

Accordingly, <a href="Task%20Force%2090">Task Force 90</a> (CTF-90) was inaugurated under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Lorenzo%20Sabin">Lorenzo Sabin</a>. US servicemen renovated and transformed cargo vessels and tank carriers to house the thousands of Vietnamese who would be evacuated in them. The repairs were frequently done en route to Haiphong from their bases at <a href="Subic%20Bay">Subic Bay</a> in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. Sabin had no prior involvement in humanitarian matters, and he and his staff prepared Operation Order 2–54—the 114-page policy framework for the operation—in the space of a week during their sea voyage from Japan to Vietnam.

The first US vessel to participate in the mass evacuation was the , which left Haiphong on August 17. It carried 1,924 refugees for a 1,600 kilometre, three-day journey to the southern capital. By this time, there were already 132,000 people registered at the waiting areas, although very few had any identification. As a result, there would be more work to be done in identifying their needs once they arrived in the south. The followed on the next day, with 2,100 passengers. Both were originally built as attack transport vessels. In August, the US policy was liberalised so that Vietnamese and French military personnel could also be evacuated at the discretion of CTF-90 and the <a href="Chief%20Military%20Assistance%20Advisory%20Group">Chief Military Assistance Advisory Group</a> (CHMAAG). To cope with the rising volume of southbound sea transport, CHMAAG established a refugee debarkation site at <a href="V%C5%A9ng%20T%C3%A0u">Vũng Tàu</a>, a coastal port at the entrance of the <a href="Saigon%20River">Saigon River</a>. This site relieved congestion in the Saigon refugee camps and decreased the traffic bottlenecks along the river. A setback occurred when a <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a> struck the Haiphong area, destroying almost half of the refugee staging area. Despite the problems, by September 3, the US Navy had evacuated 47,000 northerners after only two weeks of operations. The high rate of evacuation caused the South Vietnamese government to order that only one shipment of at most 2,500 passengers was to arrive in Saigon or Vũng Tàu per day, until September 25. The population pressure in the south was eased as incoming numbers fell due to Viet Minh propaganda campaigns and forcible detention, combined with the rice harvesting season, which had prompted some to delay their departure. Some were even waiting to finish all their business deals before moving in the Lunar New Year. On October 10, the Viet Minh were given full control of Hanoi, closing off one point of evacuation for those who wanted out. Some also decided to stay behind and see how the Viet Minh would treat the inhabitants of Hanoi before making a decision on whether to leave their ancestral lands. On October 20, the French authorities that were still in control of the ports decided to waive docking fees on US vessels engaged in the evacuation. Because of the high demand, the naval vessels had to travel quickly; one ship completed one round trip in a record of only six days. The record for the most passengers taken in one journey was set by the USS "General Black", which sailed on October 29 with 5,224 Vietnamese aboard. In November, the evacuation was further hampered by another typhoon, while the entire crew of one American vessel were struck down by a <a href="scabies">scabies</a> outbreak. In December, because of Viet Minh obstruction, which prevented people from rural and regional areas from travelling to Hanoi and Haiphong to emigrate, the French Navy sent ships to hover just off the coast near the regional town of <a href="Vinh">Vinh</a> to evacuate refugees.
According to COMIGAL, the South Vietnamese government agency responsible for the migration, French aircraft made 4,280 trips, carrying a total of 213,635 refugees. A total of 555,037 passengers were recorded on 505 sea trips. The French Navy accounted for the vast majority of the naval evacuees, with 388 voyages, while the US Navy made 109. British, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>ese and <a href="Poland">Polish</a> ships made two, two and four journeys respectively. The official figures reported that a total of 768,672 people had migrated under military supervision. Of this number around 190,000 were French and Saigon soldiers and returned prisoners; some 43,000 were military dependents, "15,000–25,000 Nung tribesmen who were military auxiliaries, between 25,000 and 40,000 French citizens, and about 45,000 Chinese residents." It also included several thousand people who had worked for the French and Vietnamese administrations in the North. The official figures recorded that more than 109,000 people journeyed into the south by their own means, some arriving outside the 300-day period. These people typically crossed the river that divided the zones on makeshift rafts, sailed on improvised watercraft into a southern port, or trekked through Laos. As of 1957, the South Vietnamese government claimed a total of 928,152 refugees, of whom 98.3% were ethnic Vietnamese. The 1957 report said that 85% were engaged in farming or fishing for their livelihood and 85% were <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholics</a>, while the remainder were Buddhists or <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>s. However, an October 1955 government report claimed that 76.3% were Catholics, 23.5% were Buddhists and 0.2% Protestants. In 1959, however, the head of COMIGAL, Bui Van Luong, admitted that the actual number of refugees could have been as low as 600,000. The official data excluded approximately 120,000 anti-communist military personnel and claimed that only 4,358 people moved north, though no historians consider this number credible. The northward migration was attributed to itinerant workers from <a href="Plantation%23Rubber">rubber plantations</a> who returned north for family reasons.

An independent study by the French historian <a href="Bernard%20B.%20Fall">Bernard B. Fall</a> determined that the US Navy transported around 310,000 refugees. The French were credited with around 214,000 airlifted refugees, 270,000 seaborne refugees and 120,000 and 80,000 Vietnamese and French military evacuees respectively. During the US Navy voyages, 54 people died on board, and 111 babies were born. Fall believed that of the 109,000 refugees who went south by their own means, a large number hitchhiked on southbound French transport vessels that were not related to the migration operation. Fall felt that the figures were likely to have been overestimated, due to immigration fraud. Some refugees would travel south and register themselves, before smuggling themselves onto vessels returning north for another shipment of humans. They would then return south and re-register to claim another aid package. Likewise, with instances of entire villages moving south, the authorities frequently did not explicitly count the number of villagers, but simply took the word of the village leaders. The chiefs would often inflate the population figures to claim more aid rations. The mass exodus did not disrupt the north largely because whole villages often emigrated, instead of half a village moving and leaving the remainder of the community in disarray. Fall estimated that around 120,000 Viet Minh troops and their dependents went north. Most of these evacuations were attributed to Viet Minh military strategy, with some being ordered to stay behind in readiness for future guerrilla activities. The northward movement was facilitated by vessels leaving from assembly areas at <a href="Qui%20Nh%C6%A1n">Qui Nhơn</a> and <a href="C%C3%A0%20Mau">Cà Mau</a> at the southernmost extremity of Vietnam. The voyages to North Vietnam were provided by empty French ships heading back north to fetch more southbound anti-communists, as well vessels from communist nations such as Poland. The Viet Minh also actively cultivated the <a href="Montagnard%20%28Vietnam%29">Montagnard</a> indigenous people of Vietnam, whose land in the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Vietnam%29">Central Highlands</a> was encroached upon by incoming northern settlers. The communists spread propaganda through broadcasts in tribal languages and infiltrated the highland areas. According to a study by the <a href="Michigan%20State%20University%20Vietnam%20Advisory%20Group">Michigan State University Group</a>, some 6,000 tribespeople went north with the communists, accompanied by some Viet Minh who had adopted the indigenous culture.
The largest numbers of Catholic refugees came from the two northern dioceses with the highest percentage of Catholics in Vietnam. These were <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Phat%20Diem">Phát Diêm</a> and <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20B%C3%B9i%20Chu">Bùi Chu</a>, mainly located in modern-day <a href="Ninh%20B%C3%ACnh%20Province">Ninh Bình</a> and <a href="Nam%20%C4%90%E1%BB%8Bnh%20Province">Nam Định Province</a>s respectively. The bishops of the dioceses had been strident opponents of the communists, and both had organised Catholic paramilitary groups that fought against the Viet Minh, which had long identified Catholics with colonial collaborationism. When the communists had gained the upper hand in the north, many Catholics had already begun making preparations to move to the south, where the communists were less influential, and large movements began immediately when news of the partition came through. After the defeat of French Union forces at Dien Bien Phu, French officers had evacuated their troops from Bui Chu and Phat Diem to reinforce the area between Hanoi and Haiphong which they still controlled, making it very easy for the communists to progress through the Catholic strongholds.
The French withdrawal was not announced and was supposed to be secret, but the local church leadership found out quickly and the local Catholic community had already begun to move to the ports before end of talks in Geneva. By the time the accords were signed, 45,000 Catholic refugees were already waiting in Hanoi, Haiphong or <a href="H%E1%BA%A3i%20D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng">Hải Dương</a>. According to the records of the Catholic Church, over 70% of Catholics in Bui Chu and Phat Diem left, compared to around 50% in most other areas. The Catholic records claim that only a third of Hanoi Catholics left, and that around 80% of all clergy left. In all areas, a higher proportion of priests left than laypeople, which has been attributed to the communists inflicting heavier punishments on more prominent opposition figures, such as clerics. The departure rate was also lower in areas further removed from the coastal areas and departure ports; in <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20H%C6%B0ng%20H%C3%B3a">Hưng Hóa</a>, only 11.8% of Catholics were recorded by their diocese as have migrated. It has been speculated that the low rate of Hanoi residents choosing to depart may have been because the city was relatively untouched by the decade of fighting, and that the varying and high rate of departures among rural Catholics was due to the influence of the local clergy; priests in northern Vietnam were noted to be more theocratic and involved in civic decision-making. They used a variety of ways to persuade their disciples to migrate; some explained their belief that circumstances would be difficult for people who did not immigrate, some simply gave dogmatic reasons such as "God is not here any more", while others gave no reason at all and made declarations such as "We are leaving tomorrow" in the expectation that their followers would obey without question. Surveys on the immigrants suggested they were largely content to follow the recommendation of the local priest. In some areas, the bishop in charge of the diocese told Catholics to stay, but laypeople were more likely to leave or stay depending on the stance of the local priest with whom they had regular contact; in many cases, such as in Hanoi, a majority of priests ignored their bishop and left anyway.

In many cases, families left some members behind in the hope that they would retain land for the family, while there were reports that a minority of Catholics with links to the communists decided to stay willingly.

The US provided emergency food, medical care, clothing and shelter at reception centres in Saigon and elsewhere in the south. American sources donating through the <a href="Agency%20for%20International%20Development">United States Operations Mission</a> (USOM) were responsible for 97% of the aid. The USOM sent public health professionals to help with sanitation in an attempt to prevent the spread of disease. Doctors and nurses were sent to help train local workers in healthcare procedures, so that they would eventually be able to take care of the medical needs refugees. In order of contributions to the aid efforts, the US were followed by France, United Kingdom, Australia, West Germany, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Australian sent farming equipment and accompanying technical instructors under the <a href="Colombo%20Plan">Colombo Plan</a>.

With most of the refugees being Catholic, the voluntary agencies most prominent in helping the US and French governments with humanitarian relief efforts were Catholic. The <a href="National%20Catholic%20Welfare%20Conference">National Catholic Welfare Conference</a> and <a href="Catholic%20Relief%20Services">Catholic Relief Services</a> contributed over US$35 million ($ as of 2019) and sent hundreds of aid workers to South Vietnam. US clerics such as <a href="Joseph%20Harnett">Joseph Harnett</a> spent more than a year supervising the establishment of humanitarian and religious projects in Saigon. These included the establishment and maintenance of orphanages, hospitals, schools and churches. Harnett's volunteers fed rice and warm milk to 100,000 refugees on a daily basis. Tens of thousands of blankets donated by the American Catholic organisations served as beds, makeshift roofs against monsoonal downpours and as temporary walls in mass housing facilities. The <a href="United%20Nations%20Children%27s%20Fund">United Nations Children's Fund</a> contributed technical assistance and helped to distribute merchandise, foodstuffs and various other gifts.

The US ran a propaganda campaign through the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) to enhance the size of the southward exodus. The program was directed by Colonel <a href="Edward%20Lansdale">Edward Lansdale</a>, who masqueraded as the assistant US air attaché in Saigon while leading a covert group that specialised in psychological warfare. Lansdale had advised Diem that it was imperative to maximise the population in the south in preparation for the national reunification elections. When Diem noted the limited ability of the south to absorb refugees, Lansdale assured him that the US would bear the burden. Diem thus authorised Lansdale to launch the propaganda campaign. According to the historian Seth Jacobs, the campaign "ranked with the most audacious enterprises in the history of covert action". Lansdale recollected that "U.S. officials wanted to make sure that as many persons as possible, particularly the strongly anti-communist Catholics, relocated in the South". While many Diem supporters claimed that the mass exodus was proof of the popularity of Diem and the people's hatred of communism, the CIA operative Chester Cooper said "the vast movement of Catholics to South Vietnam was not spontaneous". However, while Lansdale is often credited by historians—usually those critical of his influence—with the large exodus of refugees due to superstition, he rejected the notion that his campaign had much effect on popular sentiment, saying in later years: "People don’t just pull up their roots and transplant themselves because of slogans. They honestly feared what might happen to them, and their emotion was strong enough to overcome their attachment to their land, their homes, and their ancestral graves. So the initiative was very much theirs—and we mainly made the transportation possible." Some northerners who stayed behind and were interviewed half a century later said that they had not come across any pro-migration propaganda and said that their decisions were based on discussions with fellow locals. They said that concerns over the possible effects of communist rule were discussed among themselves independent of outside information.

Lansdale employed a variety of stunts to encourage more northerners to move south. South Vietnamese soldiers in civilian clothing infiltrated the north, spreading rumours of impending doom. One story was that the communists had a deal with Vietnam's traditional enemy China, allowing two communist Chinese divisions to invade the north. The story reported that the Chinese were raping and pillaging with the tacit approval of the communists. Lansdale hired counterfeiters to produce bogus Viet Minh leaflets on how to behave under communist rule, advising them to create a list of their material possessions so that the communists would be able to confiscate them more easily, thereby fomenting peasant discontent.

Lansdale's men forged documents allegedly issued by the Vietminh that promised to seize all private property. He claimed that "The day following distribution of these leatlets, refugee registration tripled". The Central Evacuation Committee in Haiphong, an American-funded group, issued pamphlets claiming that in South Vietnam, "the cost of living is three times less", and that there would be welfare payments and free ricelands, the latter two of which were false. It said that "By remaining in the North you will experience famine and will damn your souls. Set out now, brothers and sisters!"

The most inflammatory rumour was that Washington would launch an attack to liberate the north when all anti-communists had fled south. It claimed that the Americans would use <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>s and that the only way of avoiding death in a nuclear holocaust was to move south. Lansdale's team disseminated pamphlets that depicted Hanoi with three circles of nuclear destruction superimposed on it. Lansdale's saboteurs also poured sugar into the petrol tanks of Viet Minh vehicles. Soothsayers were bribed to predict disaster under communism, and prosperity for those who went south.

Lansdale's campaign focused on northern Catholics, who were known for their strongly anti-communist tendencies. His staff printed tens of thousands of pamphlets with slogans such as "Christ has gone south" and "the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a> has departed from the North", alleging anti-Catholic persecution under <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a>. Posters depicting communists closing a cathedral and forcing the congregation to pray in front of Ho, adorned with a caption "make your choice", were pasted around Hanoi and Haiphong. Diem himself went to Hanoi several times in 1954 while the French were still garrisoned there to encourage Catholics to move, portraying himself as a savior of Catholics. The campaign resonated with northern Catholic priests, who told their disciples that Ho would end freedom of worship, that sacraments would no longer be given and that anyone who stayed behind would endanger their souls. A survey of refugees some five decades later confirmed that they felt their interests would be best served under a Catholic leader and that Diem had substantial personal appeal due to his religion. Some have argued that the Catholics would have left regardless of Lansdale's activities, as they had first-hand experiences of their priests and co-religionists being captured and executed for resisting the communist revolution.

Regardless of the impact of the propaganda campaigns, the Catholic immigrants helped to strengthen Diem's support base. Before the partition, most of Vietnam's Catholic population lived in the north. After the borders were sealed, the majority were now under Diem's rule. The Catholics implicitly trusted Diem due to their common faith and were a source of loyal political support. One of Diem's main objections to the Geneva Accords—which the State of Vietnam refused to sign—was that it deprived him of the Catholic regions of North Vietnam, and he had unsuccessfully called for Bui Chu and Phat Diem to be omitted from the communist zone. With entire Catholic provinces moving south en masse, in 1956 the Diocese of Saigon had more Catholics than Paris and Rome. Of Vietnam's 1.45 million Catholics, over a million lived in the south, 55% of whom were northern refugees. Prior to this, only 520,000 Catholics lived in the Dioceses of Saigon and Huế combined. Lansdale employed the refugee movements as a cover for paramilitary activities from his Saigon Military Mission.

Apart from anti-communist campaigning, economics was another factor in moving south. The US gave handouts of US$89 ($ as of 2019) for each refugee who moved; the per capita income in Vietnam at the time was only $85 per year ($ per year as of 2019). Others have pointed to natural geographic factors unrelated to and uncontrollable by political regimes. They point to the fact that the land in the south was seen as being more productive, and memories of the <a href="Great%20Vietnamese%20Famine%20of%201945">Great Vietnamese Famine of 1945</a>, which killed millions in the north, as reasons independent of politics that motivated migrants. In the mid-1950s, northern Vietnam again suffered food shortages, and some migrants have cited food security as motive for relocation. Adding to this was a general perception that Saigon was a more modern city with more economic vibrancy. Earlier in the 20th century, there had also been instances of campaigns by Catholics to encourage southerly migration to exploit underdeveloped land in the south, so it was not a new concept for them.

The Viet Minh engaged in counter-propaganda campaigns in an attempt to deter the exodus from the north. They moved through the neighbourhoods of Hanoi and Haiphong on a daily basis, passing out their pamphlets. Evacuees reported being ridiculed by the Viet Minh, who claimed that they would be sadistically tortured before being killed by the French and American authorities in Haiphong. The communists depicted the personnel of <a href="Task%20Force%2090">Task Force 90</a> as cannibals who would eat their babies, predicting disaster in the jungles, beaches and mountains of South Vietnam. They further said that the Americans would throw them overboard to drown in the ocean. The Viet Minh boasted to the emigrants that it was a high and futile risk, asserting that the 1956 reunification elections would result in a decisive communist victory. The communist efforts were helped by the fact that many French or State of Vietnam offices in the north evacuated their personnel and sold or otherwise left behind their printing facilities, many of which fell into Viet Minh hands.

Along with counter-propaganda, the Viet Minh also sought to detain or otherwise prevent would-be refugees from leaving. As the American and French military personnel were only present in the major cities and at air bases and on the waterfront, the communists tried to stop people from trying to leave through a military presence in the ruralside to interdict the flow of would-be refugees. The communists were most effective in <a href="Ngh%E1%BB%87%20An%20Province">Nghệ An</a> and <a href="Thanh%20H%C3%B3a%20Province">Thanh Hóa Province</a>s, which they had long controlled; only 20% of Catholics in Thanh Hóa migrated. In parts of the Red River Delta, ferry services and other water traffic were shut down so that refugees would not be able to travel to Haiphong. In some cases there were reports of thousands-strong groups of refugees being forced back by similar numbers of armed communist cadres. The most notorious took place at Tra Ly and Ba Lang. At Tra Ly, Viet Minh troops forcibly dispersed most of a group of about 10,000 refugees. Some villagers who fled to sandbars offshore hoping for sanctuary were trapped by rising tides. The French asked the International Control Commission to dispatch mobile teams to Tra Ly, but the Viet Minh hindered ICC movement and had finished their job before the team arrived. French naval officers on the scene reported that the Viet Minh fired upon villagers in the dunes. At Ba Lang in December, the Viet Minh arrested refugee leaders who had contacted a French ship. This prompted villagers to clash with soldiers, killing one and capturing three, before barricading themselves inside a church. Troops forced their way into the church and dispersed the Vietnamese peasants, arresting several hundred. The village leader and a priest were tried by a kangaroo "People’s Court" and sentenced to prison. As a result, many refugees headed directly for the nearest coastal point to wait for passing vessels. In one sweep of the coast near the Catholic stronghold of <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Phat%20Diem">Phát Diêm</a>, the French Navy picked up 42,000 stranded refugees in two days. The VNA also swept the area in late 1954 for two days, picking up several thousand refugees, but increasing communist attacks forced them to stop. In some rural coastal areas where it was common for refugees to converge before boarding vessels to connect to the long-distance naval vessels taking them south, the Viet Minh installed mortars on the beaches to deter prospective immigrants.

They prohibited mass gatherings in an attempt to stop entire villages or other large groups of people from emigrating together, and also isolated people who sold their water buffalo and other belongings, as this was a clear sign that they intended to end their farming. Both the Americans and the South Vietnamese lodged complaints to the <a href="International%20Control%20Commission">International Control Commission</a> about the violations of the Geneva Accords, but little action was taken. According to B. S. M. Murti, the Indian representative on the ICC, the communists did not try to stop the refugees at first, but increased their efforts over time as it became clearer that large proportions of the population wanted to emigrate.

The United States reaped substantial public relations benefits from the mass exodus, which was used to depict the allure of the "free world". This was enhanced by the comparatively negligible number of people who voluntarily moved into the communist north. The event generated unprecedented press coverage of Vietnam. Initially however, the press coverage was scant, and Admiral Sabin bemoaned the lack of promotional work done by the US Navy to publicise the evacuation among the American media. At one point, a journalist from the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> travelled from <a href="Manila">Manila</a> to Haiphong, but was ordered back by superiors on the grounds that Americans were not interested in the subject.

However, over time, the media interest grew. Many prominent news agencies sent highly decorated reporters to cover the event. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" dispatched <a href="F.%20Tillman%20Durdin">Tillman</a> and <a href="Peggy%20Durdin">Peggy</a> Durdin, while the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>" sent the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning war reporters <a href="Marguerite%20Higgins">Marguerite Higgins</a> and <a href="Homer%20Bigart">Homer Bigart</a>. Future US embassy official <a href="John%20Mecklin">John Mecklin</a> covered the event for "<a href="Time%20Life">Time Life</a>". The press reports presented highly laudatory and emotional accounts of the mass exodus of Vietnamese away from the communist north. "Time Life" called the mass migration "a tragedy of almost nightmarish proportions ... Many [refugees] went without food or water or medicine for days, sustained only by the faith in their heart."

In the American Catholic press, the migration was given front-page coverage in diocesan newspapers. The accounts were often sensationalist, demonizing the communist Viet Minh as religious persecutors who committed barbaric atrocities against Catholics. "<a href="Our%20Sunday%20Visitor">Our Sunday Visitor</a>" called the "persecution" in Vietnam "the worst in history", alleging that the Viet Minh engaged in "child murder and cannibalism". San Francisco's "Monitor" told of a priest whom the Viet Minh "beat with guns until insensible and then buried alive in a ditch". <a href="Newark%2C%20Ohio">Newark, Ohio</a>'s "<a href="The%20Advocate%20%28Newark%29">The Advocate</a>" posted an editorial cartoon titled "Let Our People Go!", depicting mobs of Vietnamese refugees attempting to break through a blood-laced fence of barbed wire. <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>'s "Catholic Herald Citizen" described two priests who had been chained together and "suffered atrocious and endless agony". Other papers depicted the Viet Minh blowing up churches, torturing children and gunning down elderly Catholics. One paper proclaimed that "the people of Vietnam became a crucified people and their homeland a national Golgotha". The Catholic media also ran stories about Buddhist refugees who converted, hailing it as proof of their religion's superiority.

The mass influx of refugees presented various social issues for South Vietnam. The new arrivals needed to be integrated into society with jobs and housing, as long periods in tents and temporary housing would sap morale and possibly foster pro-communist sympathies. Diem had to devise programs to ease his new citizens into the economic system.

Diem appointed <a href="Bui%20Van%20Luong">Bui Van Luong</a>—a family friend and devout Catholic—as the head of COMIGAL, the government resettlement agency. COMIGAL worked in cooperation with the United States Operations Mission, the non-military wing of the American presence and the <a href="Military%20Assistance%20Advisory%20Group">Military Assistance Advisory Group</a>. Although COMIGAL was purely dedicated to refugee issues, there was a constant turnover of public servants through their staff, and the benefits of continuity did not materialize. After only a few months in the job, Luong was replaced by Pham Van Huyen on December 7, 1954. COMIGAL were supplemented by American Catholic aid agencies and an <a href="Michigan%20State%20University%20Vietnam%20Advisory%20Group">advisory group from Michigan State University</a>, where Diem had stayed while in self-imposed exile in the early 1950s. There were three phases in the resettlement program. With more than 4,000 new arrivals per day, the northerners were housed in Saigon and Vũng Tàu in 42 makeshift reception centers. These consisted of existing schools, vacated French barracks, churches and tent cities on the grounds of <a href="Tan%20Son%20Nhut%20Air%20Base">Tan Son Nhut Air Base</a> and <a href="Ph%C3%BA%20Th%E1%BB%8D%20Racecourse">Phú Thọ Racecourse</a>. These could not be used indefinitely as the grounds needed to be used for their preexisting purpose, and furthermore, such ad hoc areas were vulnerable to outbreaks of fire and disease.

The refugees needed buildings such as schools, hospitals, warehouses, places of worship were built for them. As part of the second phase, temporary villages were built and by mid-1955, most of the one million refugees were living in rows of temporary housing settlements, mostly near highways leading out of Saigon, in provinces adjacent to the capital. The largest concentration of housing in this second stage was located to the north of the capital. Only a minority could be sent to the fertile <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>, as the area was already overcrowded. It was also restive due to the presence of militant religious sects, so the most of the military evacuees were sent there.

Overcrowding was a serious problem in many of the ad hoc secondary camps set up in the Saigon region, and led to public health issues. The <a href="Bi%C3%AAn%20H%C3%B2a">Biên Hòa</a> region on the northeastern outskirts of Saigon was scheduled to have a capacity of 100,000 refugees, but this was soon exceeded. In the Ho Nai camp near Bien Hoa, which was supposed to hold only 10,000 refugees, more than 41,000 were present by the end of 1954. The area surrounding <a href="Th%E1%BB%A7%20D%E1%BA%A7u%20M%E1%BB%99t">Thủ Dầu Một</a> north of the southern capital had initially been allocated a quota of 20,000 even though there was no rice paddies in the area. The area near <a href="T%C3%A2y%20Ninh">Tây Ninh</a> was to accommodate 30,000 people, although the locals thought that 100,000 could fit in. Some large Catholic settlements such as <a href="Th%E1%BB%A7%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c%20District">Thủ Đức</a>, <a href="B%C3%ACnh%20Th%E1%BA%A1nh%20District">Bình Thạnh</a> and <a href="G%C3%B2%20V%E1%BA%A5p%20District">Gò Vấp</a> on the outskirts of Saigon have now been subsumed by urban sprawl and are now districts of the city. Because of the excessive number of inhabitants, the infrastructure at many camps could not cope and the promises made to the refugees were not kept. American military doctors travelled around the south in groups of three, and because of the paucity of health professionals, saw around 150–450 patients per day. They were also hampered by customs law, which only allowed charities to bring medicine into the country without taxation. This forced them to turn to charitable organisations as a conduit, creating another layer of bureaucracy. This was exacerbated by the fact that some corrupt Vietnamese officials pocketed the medical aid.

The organisational ability of the government agencies charged with overseeing the integration of the refugees into society was frequently criticised by American officials. In many cases, the individual officials simply made their own decisions and the goal of resettling the northerners without disruption to the existing local economy or social structure was not achieved. In other cases, the northern Catholics formed their own committees and settled and built on areas as they saw fit. By the end of September, the shortage of funds and equipment had eased, but their distribution was not organised or coordinated effectively. At the same time, some Viet Minh cadres who stayed in the south after the partition pretended to be refugees and stirred up trouble inside the camps. Aside from disruption by communists, other non-communist movements such as the <a href="Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Nam%20Qu%E1%BB%91c%20D%C3%A2n%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A3ng">Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng</a> were strong in areas of central Vietnam, were opponents of Diem and some of them were military personnel. This sometimes caused hindrance in civilian-military cooperation in the resettlement program, as some of Diem's public servants were suspicious of the military's reliability as a working partner.

At the time, much of the rural ricelands had been abandoned due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and to allow them to start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.

The next objective was to integrate the refugees into South Vietnamese society. At the time, there was a lack of arable land in secure areas. In early 1955, the Viet Minh still controlled much of the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>, while other parts were controlled by the private armies of the <a href="Cao%20%C4%90%C3%A0i">Cao Đài</a> and <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a> religious sects. The <a href="B%C3%ACnh%20Xuy%C3%AAn">Bình Xuyên</a> organised crime gang controlled the streets of Saigon, having purchased the operating license for the national police from Emperor <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bảo Đại</a>. The new arrivals could not be safely sent to the countryside until the Viet Minh had moved north and Diem had dispersed the sects and gangs. The urban areas were secured when the VNA defeated the Bình Xuyên in the <a href="Battle%20for%20Saigon">Battle for Saigon</a> in late April and early May. Lansdale managed to bribe many of the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài military commanders to integrate into Diem's VNA, but some commanders fought on. It was not until early 1956 that the last Hoa Hao commander, <a href="Ba%20C%E1%BB%A5t">Ba Cụt</a>, was captured in an <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> campaign by General <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Minh">Dương Văn Minh</a>. This allowed COMIGAL to send expeditions to survey the rural land for settlement.

The third phase of the resettlement involved the dispersal of the new arrivals from the temporary villages in regions surrounding the capital and other large cities. The areas where the refugees had initially were over settled, notably Biên Hòa, where the population had doubled during the migration period. In contrast, two thirds of South Vietnamese provinces had taken less than 10,000 refugees, and some of these less than 1,000. In the crowded provinces there were fears of social unrest due to a shortage of work.

COMIGAL dispatched inspection teams throughout South Vietnam to identify areas that were suitable for accommodating the new arrivals according to their professional skills. This required a search for arable land for farmers, favourable coastal areas for fishing and areas near large population centres for industrially oriented arrivals. Having identified the relevant areas, COMIGAL would set up plans for settlement subprojects, sending proposals to the USOM or the <a href="French%20Technical%20and%20Economic%20Cooperation%20Bureau">French Technical and Economic Cooperation Bureau</a> to gain approval and funding. The bureaucracy was relatively low, with most applications taking less than a fortnight for finalising paperwork and receiving approval. Each subproject was given a nine-month deadline for completion.

When suitable areas were found, groups of refugees usually numbering between one and three thousand were trucked to the site and began creating the new settlement. This involved digging wells, building roads and bridges, clearing forests, bushes and swamps and constructing fishing vessels. Village elections were held to select members for committees that would liaise with COMIGAL on behalf of the new settlement.

COMIGAL provided the settlers with agrarian implements, fertilisers and farm animals. By mid-1957, 319 villages had been built. Of these, 288 were for farmers and 26 for fishermen. The refugees settled predominantly in the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>, where 207 villages were built. The most notable scheme in the area was the Cai San Agricultural Resettlement Project, based along a system of canals near <a href="Long%20Xuy%C3%AAn">Long Xuyên</a>. Another 50 villages were created further north near the border with North Vietnam, while 62 were built in the central highlands. A 1955 government report claimed that only 2% of the land in the central highlands, mostly inhabited by indigenous tribes were being used for economic purposes, and it was seen as a key area for exploitation and building settlements to block the advance of communism. The area was seen as an important means of alleviating overcrowding, fuelling rapid economic development, and the government hoped that the presence of ethnic Vietnamese development would prompt the indigenous tribespeople to abandon their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, thus "guiding them on the path to civilization and progress, so that they might join the ranks of the State's founders and liberators". In the Central Highlands town of <a href="Bu%C3%B4n%20Ma%20Thu%E1%BB%99t">Buôn Ma Thuột</a>, the local sawmill was inundated with lumber to build houses and much of the surrounding forest was cleared for settlements. In total, 92,443 housing units were constructed, serviced by 317 and 18 elementary and secondary schools respectively. 38,192 hectares of land were cleared and some 2.4 million tons of <a href="potassium%20sulfate">potassium sulfate</a> fertiliser were distributed. At the end of 1957, Diem dissolved COMIGAL, declaring that its mission had been accomplished.

The program had some loose ends that manifested themselves later. Many refugees were not economically integrated and lived from government handouts. Critics noted that the refugees had become a special interest group that fostered resentment. The COMIGAL officials often decided not to split up refugees belonging to the same village, hoping to maintain social continuity. In some cases, Catholic priests refused to obey government directives to settle in certain areas. Many of the refugees also refused to relocate from the camps on the outskirts of the capital, wanting to live an urban lifestyle, and objecting to Diem's desire that they help developed inhospitable frontier territory where disease was more common and the economy less developed. On occasions, the reluctance to disperse away from Saigon resulted in protests outside Diem's residence. Many Catholic villages were effectively transplanted into southern territory. This was efficient in the short run but meant that they would never assimilate into southern society. They had little contact with the Buddhist majority and often held them in contempt, sometimes flying the Vatican flag instead of the national flag. Peter Hansen, an Australian Catholic priest and academic scholar of religion, has added that tensions between northern and southern Catholics were also present, due to issues of regionalism and local traditions. Hansen also said that northern Catholics took a more defensive attitude towards other religions than their southern co-religionists, and were more likely to see non-Catholics as a threat. He further noted that northern Catholics had a more theocratic outlook in that they were more willing to listen to the advice of priests on a wide range of issues, not only spiritual and ecclesiastical matters. These differences and the sense of segregation persist to the current day.

Diem, who had a reputation for heavily favouring Catholics, granted his new constituents a disproportionately high number of government and military posts on religious grounds rather than merit. The disproportionate number of northerners who occupied leadership posts also raised tensions among some regional-minded southerners who regarded them as intruders. He continued the French practice of defining Catholicism as a "religion" and Buddhism as an "association", which restricted their activities. This fostered a social divide between the new arrivals and their compatriots. While on a visit to Saigon in 1955, the British journalist and novelist <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a> reported that Diem's religious favouritism "may well leave his tolerant country a legacy of anti-Catholicism". In 1963, simmering discontent over Diem's religious bias exploded into mass civil unrest during the <a href="Buddhist%20crisis">Buddhist crisis</a>. After the <a href="Buddhist%20flag">Buddhist flag</a> was prohibited from public display for the <a href="Vesak">Vesak</a> celebrations commemorating the birth of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>, Diem's forces opened fire and killed nine protesters. As demonstrations continued through the summer, the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Special%20Forces">Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces</a> ransacked pagodas across the country, killing hundreds and jailing thousands of Buddhists. The tension culminated in Diem being overthrown and <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">assassinated</a> in a <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">November coup</a>.

The indigenous population in the central highlands complained bitterly about the settlement of ethnic Vietnamese Catholics in their regions. As a result of their discontent with the southern government, communist propagandists in the highlands found it easier to win them over.

Barbara L

Barbara L (1947–1977) was an <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse">American Quarter Horse</a> that raced during the early 1950s and often defeated some of the best racehorses of the time. She earned $32,836 (about $ as of 2019) on the race track in 81 starts and 21 wins, including six wins in <a href="stakes%20race">stakes race</a>s. She set two track records during her racing career. After retiring from racing in 1955, she went on to become a <a href="broodmare">broodmare</a> and had 14 foals, including 11 who earned their <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Racing">Race Register of Merit</a> with the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association">American Quarter Horse Association</a> (AQHA). Her offspring earned more than $200,000 in race money. She died in 1977 and was inducted into the AQHA's <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Hall%20of%20Fame">American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame</a> in 2007.

Barbara L was foaled in 1947, a <a href="Bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> daughter of a <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> stallion named Patriotic and a Quarter Horse broodmare named Big Bess. She was registered with the AQHA as number 146,954. Her sire, or father, was a grandson of <a href="Man%20o%27%20War%20%28horse%29">Man o' War</a>, while her dam, or mother, descended from the Quarter Horse <a href="Peter%20McCue%20%28horse%29">Peter McCue</a>. Barbara L was registered as bred by James Hunt of <a href="Sonora%2C%20Texas">Sonora, Texas</a>, and her owner at the time of registration was A. B. Green, of <a href="Purcell%2C%20Oklahoma">Purcell, Oklahoma</a>.

As a yearling, Barbara L was sold at auction for $140 (approximately $ as of 2019) to a Mr. Lumpkin, who sold <a href="horse%20trailer">horse trailer</a>s for a living. She spent the next period of her life demonstrating trailers across Texas before someone suggested that Lumpkin race her. Lumpkin changed her name from "Anthem" to "Barbara L" in honor of his daughter Barbara, who was the filly's first trainer.

Barbara L's first race was in 1949 at <a href="Del%20Rio%2C%20Texas">Del Rio, Texas</a>, where she came in fourth and only rated a B <a href="speed%20index">speed index</a> (a measure of how fast a horse ran in a race). She did not win a race until her third start that year, completing a course in 23.4 seconds. In the following years, she raced at <a href="Centennial%20Race%20Track">Centennial Race Track</a> in Colorado; at Raton in New Mexico; at Albuquerque, New Mexico; at Phoenix, Arizona; at <a href="Los%20Alamitos%20Race%20Course">Los Alamitos Race Track</a> in California; and at <a href="Bay%20Meadows%20Racetrack">Bay Meadows Race Track</a>. She raced for Lumpkin until 1952, when she was sold to A. B. Green. Green raced her until May 1955, when her last start was recorded with the AQHA.

Barbara L raced for seven years, starting 81 times. She ended her career on the track with 21 victories, 23 seconds and nine third-place finishes. During her racing career, she beat a number of the top racehorses of her time: Stella Moore, Blob Jr, Bart BS, Johnny Dial, and Monita. She won six stakes races, placed second in four, and came in third in three. Her earnings on the racetrack were $32,836 (approximately $ as of 2019). The stakes wins were the Speedwell Handicap, the Del Rio Feature, the Bart BS Stakes, the Miss Princess Invitational Handicap, Maddon's Bright Eyes Handicap, and the Pima County Fair Premier Stakes. She set two track records—one at Centennial for with 20.2 seconds, the other at Los Alamitos for with 20.5 seconds—and equaled the track record at Los Alamitos with an 18.5 second run. The AQHA awarded her a <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Racing">Race Register of Merit</a> and a <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Racing">Superior Race Horse</a> award.

As a broodmare, Barbara L produced eleven <a href="foal">foal</a>s who earned their Race Register of Merit with the AQHA. Four of her foals earned speed ratings of AAAT, which would translate to speed indexes of 100 or better in current usage. She had 14 foals; collectively, they started 230 times on the racetrack, winning 52 races and earning $262,042 (approximately $ as of 2019) in races. Two of her foals won Superior Race Horse Awards: Cuter Yet, and Mr Walt. Her leading money earner was Barbara 3, who earned more than $100,000.

Barbara L's first foal was Mr. Bruce, a chestnut stallion foaled in 1956 and sired by the Thoroughbred stallion <a href="Three%20Bars">Three Bars</a>. He started 25 races, of which he won six, earning $8,283 (approximately $ as of 2019) on the track. He earned an AAA speed index and placed second once and third once in stakes races. Barbara L's next foal was Miss Olene, a bay mare sired by <a href="Leo%20%28horse%29">Leo</a> and foaled in 1957. She started 33 races and won 11 times, including one stakes race. She earned an AAAT speed index and finished third in the 1959 <a href="All%20American%20Futurity">All American Futurity</a> while earning $31,022 (approximately $ as of 2019) in total racing earnings. Polly Jane, a bay mare sired by <a href="Go%20Man%20Go">Go Man Go</a>, was Barbara L's 1958 foal. Polly Jane started 21 times, winning four races, achieving an AAA speed index, and earning $3,961 (approximately $ as of 2019). In 1959, Barbara L's foal was Mr. Walt, a bay stallion by Vandy. Mr. Walt started 55 times and had a AAAT speed index. He won nine races, including one stakes race, earning him $9,417 (approximately $ as of 2019). In 1960, Barbara L produced Barbara 2, a sorrel mare by Leo. Barbara 2 raced 11 times, winning 2 races with $2,847 (approximately $ as of 2019) in earnings and a AAAT speed index.

Barbara L's next two foals, Go Doctor and Barbara 1, did not race, but the foal born in 1963, Barbara L's Boy, started 12 times and won twice. He was sired by Depth Bars and won $1,312 (approximately $ as of 2019) and earned a AAA speed index. In 1964, Barbara L had Barbara 3, a sorrel mare sired by the Thoroughbred <a href="Top%20Deck%20%28horse%29">Top Deck</a>. Barbara 3 started 19 races and won seven times, including one stakes race. Her best speed index was AAAT and she earned $100,692 (approximately $ as of 2019). Barbara L's next foal, in 1965, was Top Decker, a brown stallion also by Top Deck. He started five times and earned a AAA speed index and $98 (approximately $ as of 2019). Barbara L did not have a foal in 1966, but in 1967 she had a bay mare named Cuter Yet by <a href="Jet%20Deck">Jet Deck</a>. Cuter Yet started 27 races and won 5 times, including 2 stakes races. Cuter Yet's race earnings were $98,806 (approximately $ as of 2019), and her highest speed index was 98. In 1968, Barbara L had Barbara Meyers, a bay mare by Kid Meyers. Barbara Meyers started six times and earned an 89 speed index and $1,082 (approximately $ as of 2019). Barbara L's 1969 foal, Peggy Rollins, did not race, but her last foal, Barbara El, a bay mare also by Kid Meyers, started 16 times and won 3 races. Barbara El won $4,522 (approximately $ as of 2019) and an 80 speed index.

Barbara L died in 1977. A stakes race was named in her honor and run at <a href="Ruidoso%20Downs%2C%20New%20Mexico">Ruidoso Downs, New Mexico</a>, in 1956. In 2006, she earned a Dam of Distinction award from the AQHA; she was inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 2007.

Greece runestones

The Greece runestones (<a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a>: "Greklandsstenarna", <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>: "Ρουνικές λίθοι Ελλάδας") are about 30 <a href="runestone">runestone</a>s containing information related to voyages made by <a href="Norsemen">Norsemen</a> to the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. They were made during the <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a> until about 1100 and were engraved in the <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> language with <a href="Younger%20Futhark">Scandinavian runes</a>. All the stones have been found in modern-day <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, the majority in <a href="Uppland">Uppland</a> (18 runestones) and <a href="S%C3%B6dermanland">Södermanland</a> (7 runestones). Most were inscribed in memory of members of the <a href="Varangian%20Guard">Varangian Guard</a> who never returned home, but a few inscriptions mention men who returned with wealth, and a <a href="%23U%20112">boulder in Ed</a> was engraved on the orders of a former officer of the Guard.

On these runestones the word "Grikkland" ("<a href="Greece">Greece</a>") appears in three inscriptions, the word "Grikk(j)ar" ("<a href="Greeks">Greeks</a>") appears in 25 inscriptions, two stones refer to men as "grikkfari" ("traveller to Greece") and one stone refers to "Grikkhafnir" ("Greek harbours"). Among other runestones which refer to expeditions abroad, the only groups which are comparable in number are the so-called "<a href="England%20runestones">England runestones</a>" that mention expeditions to England and the 26 <a href="Ingvar%20runestones">Ingvar runestones</a> that refer to a Viking expedition to the Middle East.

The stones vary in size from the small <a href="%23G%20216">whetstone from Timans</a> which measures  ×  ×  to the boulder in Ed which is in circumference. Most of them are adorned with various <a href="runestone%20styles">runestone styles</a> that were in use during the 11th century, and especially styles that were part of the <a href="Ringerike%20style">Ringerike style</a> (eight or nine stones) and the <a href="Urnes%20style">Urnes style</a> (eight stones).

Since the first discoveries by <a href="Johannes%20Bureus">Johannes Bureus</a> in the late 16th century, these runestones have been frequently identified by scholars, with many stones discovered during a national search for historic monuments in the late 17th century. Several stones were documented by <a href="Richard%20Dybeck">Richard Dybeck</a> in the 19th century. The <a href="%23S%C3%B6%20Fv1954%3B20">latest stone to be found</a> was in Nolinge, near Stockholm, in 1952.
Scandinavians had served as mercenaries in the Roman army many centuries before the Viking Age, but during the time when the stones were made, there were more contacts between Scandinavia and Byzantium than at any other time. Swedish Viking ships were common on the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>, the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a> and on the wider <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. Greece was home to the <a href="Varangian%20Guard">Varangian Guard</a>, the elite bodyguard of the <a href="Byzantine%20Emperor">Byzantine Emperor</a>, and until the <a href="Komnenos%20dynasty">Komnenos dynasty</a> in the late 11th century, most members of the Varangian Guard were <a href="Swedes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29">Swedes</a>. As late as 1195, Emperor <a href="Alexios%20III%20Angelos">Alexios Angelos</a> sent emissaries to <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a> and Sweden requesting 1,000 warriors from each of the three kingdoms. Stationed in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, which the Scandinavians referred to as "Miklagarðr" (the "Great City"), the Guard attracted young Scandinavians of the sort that had composed it since its creation in the late 10th century.

The large number of men who departed for the Byzantine Empire is indicated by the fact that the <a href="medieval%20Scandinavian%20laws">medieval Scandinavian laws</a> still contained laws concerning voyages to Greece when they were written down after the Viking Age. The older version of the "<a href="Westrogothic%20law">Westrogothic law</a>", which was written down by <a href="Eskil%20Magnusson">Eskil Magnusson</a>, the <a href="lawspeaker">lawspeaker</a> of <a href="V%C3%A4sterg%C3%B6tland">Västergötland</a> 1219–1225, stated that "no man may receive an inheritance (in Sweden) while he dwells in Greece". The later version, which was written down from 1250 to 1300, adds that "no one may inherit from such a person as was not a living heir when he went away". Also the old Norwegian "<a href="Gulating">Gulaþingslög</a>" contains a similar law: "but if (a man) goes to Greece, then he who is next in line to inherit shall hold his property".

About 3,000 runestones from the Viking Age have been discovered in Scandinavia of which c. 2,700 were raised within what today is Sweden. As many as 1,277 of them were raised in the province of Uppland alone. The Viking Age coincided with the <a href="Christianization%20of%20Scandinavia">Christianisation of Scandinavia</a>, and in many districts c. 50% of the stone inscriptions have traces of <a href="Germanic%20Christianity">Christianity</a>. In Uppland, c. 70% of the inscriptions are explicitly Christian, which is shown by engraved crosses or added Christian prayers, while only a few runestones are explicitly <a href="norse%20paganism">pagan</a>. The runestone tradition probably died out before 1100, and at the latest by 1125.

Among the runestones of the Viking Age, 9.1–10% report that they were raised in memory of people who went abroad, and the runestones that mention Greece constitute the largest group of them. In addition, there is a group of <a href="Italy%20runestones">three or four runestones</a> that commemorate men who died in southern Italy, and who were probably members of the Varangian Guard. The only group of stones comparable in number to the Greece runestones are <a href="England%20runestones">those that mention England</a>, followed by the c. 26 <a href="Ingvar%20runestones">Ingvar runestones</a> raised in the wake of the fateful <a href="Ingvar%20the%20Far-Travelled">Ingvar expedition</a> to <a href="Persia">Persia</a>.

Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) note that most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it to the fact that it was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most <a href="Rus%27%20%28people%29">Rus'</a> originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact that most of these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not necessarily mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.

Not all those who are commemorated on the Greece runestones were necessarily members of the Varangian Guard, and some may have gone to Greece as merchants or died there while passing by on a <a href="Christian%20pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>. The fact that a voyage to Greece was associated with great danger is testified by the fact that a woman had a runestone made in memory of herself "before" she departed on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem: "Ingirún Harðardóttir had runes graven for herself; she would go East and out to Jerusalem. <a href="Fot">Fótr</a> carved the runes." However, Blöndal and Benedikz (2007) state that although there were other reasons for going to Greece, it is certain that most of the runestones were made in memory of members of the Varangian Guard who died there. Still, some runestones tell of men who returned with increased wealth, and an inscription on a <a href="%23U%20112">boulder in Ed</a> was commissioned by a former captain of the Guard, <a href="Ragnvald%20Ingvarsson">Ragnvaldr</a>.

The reasons for the runestone tradition are a matter of debate but they include inheritance issues, status and the honouring of the deceased. Several runestones explicitly commemorate inheritance such as the <a href="%23U%20792">Ulunda stone</a> and the <a href="%23U%2073">Hansta stone</a>, but the vast majority of the runestones only tell who raised the stone and in memory of whom.

A view held by scholars such as <a href="Erik%20Moltke">Erik Moltke</a> and Sven B. F. Jansson holds that the runestones were primarily the result of the many Viking expeditions from Scandinavia, or to cite Jansson (1987):

When the great expeditions were over, the old trade routes closed, and the Viking ships no longer made ready each spring for voyages to east and west, then that meant the end of the carving and setting up of rune stones in the proper sense of the term. They may be called the monuments of the Viking voyages, and the sensitive reader may catch in many of their inscriptions the Viking's love of adventure and exploits of boisterous daring.
Sawyer (2000), on the other hand, reacts against this commonly held view and comments that the vast majority of the runestones were raised in memory of people who are not reported to have died abroad. She argues that few men who went abroad were honoured with memorials and the reason is that the runestones were mainly raised because of concerns at home, such as inheritance issues. Such concerns would have arisen when a family knew that a relative would not return from abroad.

Below follows a presentation of the Greece runestones based on information collected from the <a href="Rundata">Rundata</a> project, organised according to location. The <a href="Runic%20transliteration%20and%20transcription">transcriptions</a> from runic inscriptions into standardised <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> are in Old East Norse (OEN), the Swedish and Danish dialect, to facilitate comparison with the inscriptions, while the English translation provided by Rundata give the names in the standard dialect, Old West Norse (OWN), the Icelandic and Norwegian dialect.

There is a long-standing practice of writing <a href="transliteration">transliteration</a>s of the runes in Latin characters in <a href="boldface">boldface</a> and transcribing the text into a normalized form of the language with <a href="italic%20type">italic type</a>. This practice exists because the two forms of rendering a runic text have to be kept distinct. By not only showing the original inscription but also transliterating, transcribing and translating, scholars present the analysis in a way that allows the reader to follow their interpretation of the runes. Every step presents challenges, but most <a href="Younger%20Futhark">Younger Futhark</a> inscriptions are considered easy to interpret.

In transliterations, *, :, ×, and + represent common <a href="word%20divider">word divider</a>s, while ÷ represents less common ones. Parentheses, ( ), represent damaged runes that cannot be identified with certainty, and square brackets, [ ], represent sequences of runes that have been lost, but can be identified thanks to early descriptions by scholars. A short hyphen, -, indicates that there is a rune or other sign that cannot be identified. A series of three full stops ... shows that runes are assumed to have existed in the position, but have disappeared. The two dividing signs | | divide a rune into two Latin letters, because <a href="runemaster">runemaster</a>s often carved a single rune instead of two consecutive ones. §P and §Q introduce two alternative readings of an inscription that concern multiple words, while §A, §B and §C introduce the different parts of an inscription as they may appear on different sides of a runestone.

Angle brackets, , indicate that there is a sequence of runes that cannot be interpreted with certainty. Other special signs are "þ" and "ð", where the first one is the <a href="Thorn%20%28letter%29">thorn</a> letter which represents a <a href="voiceless%20dental%20fricative">voiceless dental fricative</a> as "th" in English "thing". The second letter is <a href="eth">eth</a> which stands for a <a href="voiced%20dental%20fricative">voiced dental fricative</a> as "th" in English "them". The "ʀ" sign represents the <a href="Ur%20%28rune%29">yr rune</a>, and "ô" is the same as the Icelandic <a href="O%20caudata">O caudata</a> "ǫ".

Every runic inscription is shown with its ID code that is used in scholarly literature to refer to the inscription, and it is only obligatory to give the first two parts of it. The first part is one or two letters that represent the area where the runic inscription appears, e.g. U for <a href="Uppland">Uppland</a>, Sö for <a href="S%C3%B6dermanland">Södermanland</a> and DR for <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>. The second part represents the order in which the inscription is presented in official national publications (e.g. "<a href="Sveriges%20runinskrifter">Sveriges runinskrifter</a>"). Thus <a href="%23U%2073">U 73</a> means that the runestone was the 73rd runic inscription in Uppland that was documented in "Sveriges runinskrifter". If the inscription was documented later than the official publication, it is listed according to the publication where it was first described, e.g. <a href="%23S%C3%B6%20Fv1954%3B20">Sö Fv1954;20</a>, where "Sö" represents Södermanland, "Fv" stands for the annual publication "<a href="Fornv%C3%A4nnen">Fornvännen</a>", 1954 is the year of the issue of "Fornvännen" and 20 is the page in the publication.

There are as many as 18 runestones in <a href="Uppland">Uppland</a> that relate information about men who travelled to <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Greece</a>, most of whom died there.

Runestone U 73 (<a href="http%3A//www.fmis.raa.se/cocoon/fornsok/search.html%3Fobjektid%3D10304701460001%26amp%3Btab%3D3">location</a>) was probably erected to explain the order of inheritance from two men who died as Varangians. It is in the style <a href="Runestone%20styles%23Pr3%20%28Urnes%20style%29">Pr3</a> which is part of the more general <a href="Urnes%20style">Urnes style</a>. The stone, which is of greyish <a href="granite">granite</a> measuring in height and in width, is raised on a slope some north of Hägerstalund farm, formerly Hansta(lund). The stone was discovered by <a href="Johan%20Peringski%C3%B6ld">Johan Peringskiöld</a> during the national search for historic monuments in the late 17th century. The stone shares the same message as U 72, together with which it once formed a monument, but U 72 was moved to <a href="Skansen">Skansen</a> in 1896. The latter stone relates that "these stones" were raised by Gerðarr and Jörundr in memory of Ernmundr and Ingimundr. Consequently, U 73's phrase "Inga's sons" and "they died in Greece" refer to Ernmundr and Ingimundr. Ernmundr and Ingimundr had inherited from their father, but they departed for the Byzantine Empire and died there as Varangians. As they had not fathered any children, their mother Inga inherited their property, and when she died, her brothers Gerðarr and Jörundr inherited from her. These two brothers then raised the two memorials in honour of their nephews, which was probably due to the nephews having distinguished themselves in the South. However, it may have also been in gratitude for wealth gathered by the nephews overseas. At the same time, the monument served to document how the property had passed from one <a href="Norse%20clans">clan</a> to another. Sawyer (2000), on the other hand, suggests that because the two inscriptions do not mention who commissioned them, the only eventual claimant to the fortune, and the one that had the stones made, may have been the church. The <a href="runemaster">runemaster</a> has been identified as <a href="Vis%C3%A4te">Visäte</a>.

It was first documented by Johannes Bureus in 1594. It was donated as one of a pair (the other is U 1160 ) to the <a href="Ashmolean%20Museum">Ashmolean Museum</a> in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> in 1687 upon the request of king <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II of England</a> to king <a href="Charles%20XI%20of%20Sweden">Charles XI of Sweden</a> asking for two runestones to add to the <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> collection.

It was raised by Þorsteinn in memory of his father Sveinn and his brother Þórir, both of whom went to Greece, and lastly in memory of his mother. The stone is signed by the <a href="runemaster">runemaster</a> <a href="%C3%96pir">Öpir</a> whose Old Norse is notable for its unorthodox use of the <a href="haglaz">haglaz</a> rune (ᚼ), as in hut for Old Norse "út" ("out"). The erratic use of the h-phoneme is a dialect trait that has survived and is still characteristic for the modern <a href="Swedish%20dialects">Swedish dialect</a> of <a href="Roslagen">Roslagen</a>, one of the regions where Öpir was active.

Runestone U 112 (<a href="http%3A//www.fmis.raa.se/cocoon/fornsok/search.html%3Fobjektid%3D10001200730001%26amp%3Btab%3D3">location</a>), a large boulder measuring in circumference, is beside a wooded path named Kyrkstigen ("church path") in Ed. It has been known to scholars since Johannes Bureus' first <a href="runology">runological</a> expedition in 1594, and it dates to the mid-11th century.

The boulder bears runic inscriptions on two of its sides, referred to as U 112 A and B. The linguistic significance of the inscriptions lies in the use of the <a href="haglaz">haglaz</a> (ᚼ) rune to denote the <a href="velar%20approximant">velar approximant</a> (as in "Ragnvaldr"), something that would become common after the close of the Viking Age. The inscription also includes some dotted runes, and the <a href="ansuz%20rune">ansuz</a> () rune is used for the phoneme.

The inscriptions are in the <a href="runestone%20styles%23Pr4%20%28Urnes%20style%29">Urnes style (Pr4)</a>, and they were commissioned by a former captain of the <a href="Varangian%20Guard">Varangian Guard</a> named <a href="Ragnvald%20Ingvarsson">Ragnvaldr</a> in memory of his mother as well as in his own honour. Very few could boast of returning home with the honour of having been the captain of the Varangian Guard. Moreover, the name "Ragnvaldr" shows that he belonged to the higher echelons of Old Norse society, and that he may have been a relative of <a href="House%20of%20Muns%C3%B6">the ruling dynasty</a>.

Ragnvald's maternal grandfather, Ónæmr, is mentioned on two additional runestones in <a href="Uppland">Uppland</a>, <a href="Uppland%20Runic%20Inscription%20328">U 328</a> and <a href="Orkesta%20Runestones%23U%20336">U 336</a>. Runestone U 328 relates that Ragnvaldr had two aunts, Gyríðr and Guðlaug. Additionally, runestone U 336 adds that <a href="Ulf%20of%20Borresta">Ulf of Borresta</a>, who received three <a href="Danegeld">Danegeld</a>s in England, was Ónæm's paternal nephew and thus Ragnvald's first cousin. He was probably the same Ragnvaldr whose death is related in the <a href="Hargs%20bro%20runic%20inscriptions">Hargs bro runic inscriptions</a>, which would also connect him to <a href="Estrid">Estrid</a> and the wealthy <a href="Jarlabanke%20clan">Jarlabanke clan</a>.

Considering Ragnvald's background, it is not surprising that he rose to become an officer of the Varangian Guard: he was a wealthy chieftain who brought many ambitious soldiers to Greece.

Runestone U 136 (<a href="http%3A//www.fmis.raa.se/cocoon/fornsok/search.html%3Fobjektid%3D10010400420006%26amp%3Btab%3D3">location</a>) is in the <a href="runestone%20styles%23Pr2%20%28Ringerike%20style%29">Pr2 (Ringerike) style</a>, and it once formed a monument together with <a href="Broby%20bro%20Runestones%23U%20135">U 135</a>. It is a dark greyish stone that is tall and wide. In 1857, <a href="Richard%20Dybeck">Richard Dybeck</a> noted that it had been discovered in the soil five years earlier. A small part of it had stuck up above the soil and when the landowner was tilling the land and discovered it, he had it raised again on the same spot. Some pieces were accidentally chipped away by the landowner and the upper parts of some runes were lost.

The stone was originally raised by a wealthy lady named <a href="Estrid">Ástríðr</a> in memory of her husband Eysteinn, and Sawyer (2000) suggests it to have been one of several stones made in a tug-of-war over inheritance. There is uncertainty as to why Eysteinn went to Greece and <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, because of the interpretation of the word "sœkja" (attested as "sotti" in the past tense). It means "seek" but it can mean "attack" as on the stones <a href="England%20runestones%23S%C3%B6%20166">Sö 166</a> and <a href="England%20runestones%23N%20184">N 184</a>, but also "visit" or "travel". Consequently, Eysteinn has been identified as one of the first Swedes to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but Jesch (2001) notes that judging from the other runic examples, the "attack" sense is more likely. The translation of "sœkja" as "attack" is also chosen by the Rundata project (see below). It is one of two <a href="Jarlabanke%20Runestones">Jarlabanke Runestones</a> that mention travellers abroad, the other being <a href="%23U%20140">U140, below</a>.

The granite fragment is in Ringerike style (Pr 2). It was discovered by Richard Dybeck among the foundations of a small building. Dybeck searched without success for the remaining parts. Initially, the fragment was moved to a slope near the road between Hagby and Täby church, but in 1930, it was moved next to the road. It is one of the <a href="Jarlabanke%20Runestones">Jarlabanke Runestones</a> and it mentions a man who travelled abroad (compare <a href="%23U%20136">U 136, above</a>).

Two of the men who are mentioned on the stone have names that are otherwise unknown and they are reconstructed as "Gautdjarfr" and "Sunnhvatr" based on elements known from other Norse names.

Richard Dybeck noted in 1867 that he had seen the runestone intact three years previously, but that it had been used for the construction of a basement in 1866.

The documentation from the court case shows that it had been standing at the homestead and that it had been blown up three times into small pieces that could be used for the construction of the basement. Reconstruction of the runestone was deemed impossible. The stone was tall and wide, and it was raised in memory of a father who appears to have travelled to Greece.

The parishioners did not allow him to uncover the inscription completely, and they later hid the stone under a thick layer of soil. It was not until 1942 that it was removed from the belfry and was raised anew a few paces away. The stone is in light greyish granite. It is tall above the ground and wide. The contractor of the runestone was named "Folkmarr" and it is a name that is otherwise unknown from Viking Age Scandinavia, although it is known to have existed after the close of the Viking Age. It was on the other hand a common name in <a href="West%20Germanic%20languages">West Germanic languages</a> and especially among the <a href="Franks">Franks</a>.

In 1673, during the national search for historic monuments, Abraham Winge reported that there were two runestones standing at Örby. In 1684, Peringskiöld went to Örby in order to document and depict the stones, but he found only one standing (). Instead he discovered the second, or a third runestone, U 374, as the bottom part of a fire stove. The use of the stone as a fireplace was , and the last time someone wrote about having seen it was in 1728.

As the stone was lying with the inscription side downwards, it was blown up and it was not until the shards were picked up that the runes were discovered. The runestone was mended with concrete and moved to the atrium of the church of Norrsunda. The stone is in bluish grey <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a>, and it measures in height and in width. The surfaces are unusually smooth. It is in the Ringerike (Pr2) style, and it is attributed to the runemaster Åsmund Kåresson. It was raised by a father and mother, Tófa and Hemingr, in memory of their son, Gunnarr, who died "among the Greeks", and it is very unusual that the mother is mentioned before the father.

The stone was made known by Richard Dybeck in several publications in the 1860s, and at the time it had recently been destroyed and was in several pieces of which the bottom part was still in the ground. In 1942, the stone was mended and raised anew at the original spot. The stone consists of grey and coarse granite.

The runestone was made in memory of three men, of whom two died in Greece, while a third one, <a href="Freygeirr">Freygeirr</a>, died at a debated location written as i silu × nur. Richard Dybeck suggested that it might either refer to the nearby estate of Skällnora or lake <a href="Siljan%20%28lake%29">Siljan</a>, and <a href="Sophus%20Bugge">Sophus Bugge</a> identified the location as "<a href="Saaremaa">Saaremaa</a> north" ("Øysilu nor"), whereas <a href="Erik%20Brate">Erik Brate</a> considered the location to have been <a href="Salo%2C%20Finland">Salo</a> in present-day <a href="Finland">Finland</a>.

It is mounted with iron to the northern wall of the church of Husby-Sjuhundra, but when the stone was first documented by Johannes Bureus in 1638 he noted that it was used as a threshold in the atrium of the church. It was still used as a threshold when Richard Dybeck visited it in 1871, and he arranged so that the entire inscription was made visible in order to make a cast copy. In 1887, the parishioners decided to extract both U 540 and <a href="Uppland%20Runic%20Inscription%20541">U 541</a> from the church and with financial help from the <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Letters%2C%20History%20and%20Antiquities">Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities</a> the stones were removed and attached outside the northern wall. The stone is of red sandstone and it is high and wide. Several parts of the stone and its inscription have been lost, and it is worn down due to its former use as a threshold.

A theory, proposed by <a href="German%20studies">Germanist</a> F. A. Braun (1910), which is based on the runestones runestone , U 540, <a href="Ingvar%20Runestones%23S%C3%B6%20179">Sö 179</a> and <a href="Ingvar%20Runestones%23S%C3%B6%20279">Sö 279</a>, holds the grieving Ingvar to be the same person as <a href="Ingvar%20the%20Far-Travelled">Ingvar the Far-Travelled</a>, the son of the Swedish king <a href="Emund%20the%20Old">Emund the Old</a>. Braun notes that the stones were raised at a <a href="Husby%20%28estate%29">Husby</a>, a royal residence, and the names "Eiríkr" (Eric) and "Hákon" were rather rare in Sweden, but known from the <a href="House%20of%20Muns%C3%B6">royal dynasty</a>. Önundr would be <a href="Anund%20G%C3%A5rdske">Anund Gårdske</a>, who was raised in Russia, while Eiríkr would be one of the two <a href="Eric%20Stenkilsson">pretenders named Eric</a>, and Hákon would be <a href="H%C3%A5kan%20the%20Red">Håkan the Red</a>. These identifications of the three men Eiríkr, Hákon and Ingvarr also appear in the reference work "Nordiskt runnamnslexikon" (2002), where it adds that Eiríkr is also considered to appear on the <a href="Hillersj%C3%B6%20stone">Hillersjö stone</a> and runestone <a href="F%C3%A4rentuna%20Runestones%23U%2020/U%2021">U 20</a>.

It was originally raised together with a second runestone, with one on each side of the <a href="Eriksgata">Eriksgata</a> where the road passed a ford, c. west of where the farm Ulunda is today. The Eriksgata was the path that newly elected Swedish kings passed when they toured the country in order to be accepted by the local <a href="thing%20%28assembly%29">assemblies</a>. The stone was first documented by Johannes Bureus in the 17th century, and later in the same century by <a href="Johan%20Peringski%C3%B6ld">Johan Peringskiöld</a>, who considered it to be a remarkable stone raised in memory of a <a href="petty%20king">petty king</a>, or war chief, in pagan times.

It is hidden inside the floor in <a href="Uppsala%20Cathedral">Uppsala Cathedral</a>, next to the tomb of king <a href="Gustav%20I%20of%20Sweden">Gustav Vasa</a> of Sweden. Its existence was first documented by Johannes Bureus in 1594, and in 1666, Johannes Schefferus commented on the stone as one of many runestones that had been perceived as heathen and which had therefore been used as construction material for the cathedral. Schefferus considered U 922 to be the most notable one of these stones and he regretted that parts were under the pillar and that it could thus not be read entirely. In 1675, <a href="Olof%20Verelius">Olof Verelius</a> discovered that it had been made in memory of a traveller to Greece, but still the French traveller Aubrey de la Motraye wrote home, in 1712, that he had been informed that it had been made in memory of a traveller to Jerusalem. The last scholar to report that the inscription was visible was <a href="Olof%20Celsius">Olof Celsius</a> in 1729, and it appears that it was soon covered by a new layer of floor. In 1950, professor <a href="Elias%20Wess%C3%A9n">Elias Wessén</a> and the county custodian of antiquities requested that it be removed for better analysis together with three other runestones, but the request was rejected by the Royal Board of Construction (KBS) because of safety concerns.

Ígulbjörn also appears on a second runestone in Uppsala Cathedral, U 925, made by Ígulbjörn in memory of his son Gagʀ who died "in the South", with "South" likely referring to the Byzantine Empire.

It is one of two surviving inscriptions that indicate Åsmund's <a href="patronym">patronym</a>, the other being GS 11 in Järvsta. This stone is raised at Vedyxa near <a href="Uppsala">Uppsala</a>, about east of the crossroads of the road to Lövsta and the country road between Uppsala and Funbo. The stone is in grey granite and it has an unusual shape with two flat surfaces and an obtuse angle between them. The inscription is high, of which the upper part is and the lower part , and the width is .

U 956 was first documented by Johannes Haquini Rhezelius (d. 1666), and later by <a href="Johan%20Peringski%C3%B6ld">Johan Peringskiöld</a> (1710), who commented that the inscription was legible in spite of the stone having been split in two parts.

The stone stands in a wooded field west of the road to the village <a href="Fjuckby">Fjuckby</a>, of the crossroads, and about south-south-east of the farm Fjuckby. The first scholar to comment on the stone was Johannes Bureus, who visited the stone on June 19, 1638. Several other scholars would visit the stone during the following centuries, such as Rhezelius in 1667, Peringskiöld in 1694, and Olof Celsius in 1726 and in 1738. In 1864, Richard Dybeck noted that the runestone was one of several in the vicinity that had been raised anew during the summer.

Parts of the ornamentation have been lost due to flaking, which probably happened during the 17th century, but the inscription is intact. The art on the runestone has tentatively been classified under style Pr2, but Wessén & Jansson (1953–1958) comment that the ornamentation is considered unusual and it is different from that on most other runestones in the district. Other stones in <a href="Ringerike%20style">the same style</a> are the <a href="Vang%20stone">Vang stone</a> and the <a href="Alstad%20stone">Alstad stone</a> in Norway, and and <a href="Uppland%20Runic%20Inscription%201146">U 1146</a> in Sweden. The style was better suited for wood and metal and it is likely that only few runemasters ever tried to apply it on stone.

Similar the inscription on <a href="Uppland%20Runic%20Inscription%201011">U 1011</a>, this runic inscription uses the term "stýrimaðr" as a title that is translated as "captain". Other runestones use this term apparently to describe working as a steersman on a ship. There have been several different interpretations of parts of the inscription, but the following two interpretations appear in "<a href="Rundata">Rundata</a>" (2008):

Before it was lost, it was studied and described by several scholars such as Bureus, Rhezelius, Peringskiöld and lastly by Olof Celsius in 1726.

Peringskiöld commented that the stone was reclining backwards in a <a href="Hops">hop</a>-garden at the eastern farm of Lövsta, which was later confirmed by Celius in 1726. Stolpe tried to find it, but noted in 1869 that the landowner knew of the runestone, but that the latter had reported it to be completely covered in soil, and in 1951, a runologist tried to locate the runestone but failed.

The inscription had an unusual dotted k-rune in girkium ("Greece") which it had in common with <a href="%23U%20922">U 922, above</a>, but the only difficulty that has arisen in the interpretation of the runes is the sequence onar. Rhezelius read it as a name, "Onarius", which would have belonged to a third son, whereas Verelius, Peringskiöld, Dijkman and Celsius interpreted it as the pronoun "annarr" meaning "the other" and referring to Ótryggr, an interpretation supported by Wessén and Jansson (1953–1958), and by Rundata (see below).

It was formerly under a wooden threshold inside Tumbo church, and the upper part was hidden under the wall of the atrium. Most of the inscription and the artwork have been destroyed, but what remains is classified as either style Fp or Pr1 (Ringerike style).

The stone was raised by Vésteinn in memory of his brother Freysteinn who died in Greece, and according to <a href="Omeljan%20Pritsak">Omeljan Pritsak</a>, Freysteinn was the commander of a retinue. The wolf-beast image in the center of Sö 82 touches the inscription at the name Freysteinn and has its jaws at the word for "was dead" or "died." Since one known <a href="kenning">kenning</a> in <a href="Old%20Norse%20poetry">Old Norse poetry</a> for being killed in battle was that the "wolf was fed," the combination of the text and imagery would lead to the conclusion that Freysteinn had died in battle in Greece.

The runestone was first documented during the national search for historic monuments in 1667–84 and Peringskiöld noted that it was near the village of Snesta between Ryckesta and the highway. In 1820, the stone was reported to be severely damaged and mostly hidden in the ground due to its being on the side of a local road. <a href="George%20Stephens%20%28philologist%29">George Stephens</a> reported in 1857 that its former position had been on a barrow at a small path near Ryckesta, but that it had been moved in 1830 to the avenue of the manor Täckhammar and reerected on a wooded slope some 14 paces from the entrance to the highway.

The man who raised the stone is named with the runes þruʀikr and the name was identified as "Þrýríkr" by <a href="Sophus%20Bugge">Sophus Bugge</a> who identified the first element of the name as the noun "þrýð-" that would be derived from a "*þrūði-" and correspond to Old English "þrýðu" ("power", "force"). The Old English form is cognate with the Old Icelandic element "<a href="%C3%BEr%C3%BA%C3%B0">þrúð</a>-" ("force") which appears in several Old Norse words in connection with the Norse god <a href="Thor">Thor</a>. This analysis was accepted by Brate & Wessén although they noted that the name contains ʀ instead of the expected r, whereas the <a href="Rundata">Rundata</a> corpus gives the slightly different form "Þryðríkr".

The stone was raised in memory of two sons, one of whom went to Greece where he "divided up gold", an expression that also appears on runestone <a href="%23S%C3%B6%20165">Sö 165, below</a>. It can either mean that he was responsible for distributing payment to the members of the Varangian Guard or that he took part in the division of loot. Düwel has suggested that the expression is the eastern route equivalent of "gjaldi skifti" ("divided payment") which appears in the nearby stone <a href="England%20runestones%23S%C3%B6%20166">Sö 166</a> that talks of payments to Vikings in England (see also <a href="England%20runestones%23U%20194">U 194</a>, <a href="England%20runestones%23U%20241">U 241</a> and <a href="England%20runestones%23U%20344">U 344</a>).

It is of grey granite and is tall and wide. The runestone was first documented during the national search for historic monuments (1667–81) and then it was raised near a number of raised stones. Later the runestone was moved and raised beside <a href="England%20runestones%23S%C3%B6%20166">Sö 166</a> at a ditch southwest of Grinda farm.

It was raised by a mother, Guðrun, in memory of her son, Heðinn. Like runestone Sö 163, it also reports that the man concerned went to Greece and "divided up gold" which may refer to distributing payment to members of the Varangian guard, the division of loot or having received payment (compare <a href="%23S%C3%B6%20163">Sö 163, above</a>). The inscription itself is a poem in <a href="fornyr%C3%B0islag">fornyrðislag</a>.

Runestone Sö 170 in grey granite is raised north of the former road in Nälberga (<a href="http%3A//www.fmis.raa.se/cocoon/fornsok/search.html%3Fobjektid%3D10037200800001%26amp%3Btab%3D3">location</a>), and the stone is tall and wide. Its style is tentatively given as RAK and some of the runes are <a href="cipher%20runes">cipher runes</a> in the form of branch runes. The runic text tells that a man named Báulfr died with the Greeks at a location that has not been clearly identified through several analyses of the cipher runes. Läffler (1907) suggested that the location is to be read "<a href="Ithome">Ίϑὡμη</a>" which was the name of a town in <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> and a stronghold in <a href="Messenia">Messenia</a>, also called "Θὡμη". Báulfr is described as being "þróttar þegn" or a <a href="thegn">thegn</a> of strength. The term thegn describes a class of retainer. The phrase "þróttar þegn" is used on six other runestones, Sö 90 in Lövhulta, Sö 112 in Kolunda, Sö 151 in Lövsund, and <a href="S%C3%B6dermanland%20Runic%20Inscription%20158">Sö 158</a> in Österberga, and, in its plural form at <a href="S%C3%B6dermanland%20Runic%20Inscription%20367">Sö 367</a> in Släbro and <a href="S%C3%B6dermanland%20Runic%20Inscription%20Fv1948%3B295">Sö Fv1948;295</a> in Prästgården.

It had probably been used for this purpose during a considerable period of time, because according to a drawing that was made a few years later, it was very worn down. In 1830 a church revision noted that it was in a ruined state and so worn that only a few runes remained discernible, and when Hermelin later depicted the stone, he noted that the stone had been cracked in two pieces. In 1896, the runologist Erik Brate visited the stone and discovered that one of the pieces had disappeared and that the only remaining part was reclining on the church wall. The remaining piece measured and . The stone has since then been reassembled and raised on the cemetery.

In <a href="%C3%96sterg%C3%B6tland">Östergötland</a>, there are two runestones that mention Greece. One, the notable <a href="H%C3%B6gby%20Runestone">Högby Runestone</a>, describes the deaths of several brothers in different parts of Europe.

The Högby runestone (<a href="http%3A//www.fmis.raa.se/cocoon/fornsok/search.html%3Fobjektid%3D10044000100002%26amp%3Btab%3D3">location</a>) is in Ringerike (Pr1) style, and the reddish granite stone measures in height and in width. It was formerly inserted into the outer wall of Högby church with the cross side (A) outwards. The church was demolished in 1874, and then side B of the inscription was discovered. The stone was raised anew on the cemetery of the former church.

The runestone commemorates Özurr, one of the first Varangians who is known to have died in the service of the Byzantine Emperor, and he is estimated to have died around 1010, or in the late 10th century. He was one of the sons of the "good man" Gulli, and the runestone describes a situation that may have been common for Scandinavian families at this time: the stone was made on the orders of Özur's niece, Þorgerðr, in memory of her uncles who were all dead.

Þorgerðr probably had the stone made as soon as she had learnt that Özurr, the last of her uncles, had died in Greece, and she likely did this to ensure her right of inheritance. The inscription on the reverse side of the stone, relating how her other uncles died, is in <a href="fornyr%C3%B0islag">fornyrðislag</a>.

Her uncle Ásmundr probably died in the <a href="Battle%20of%20F%C3%BDrisvellir">Battle of Fýrisvellir</a>, in the 980s, and it was probably at the side of king <a href="Eric%20the%20Victorious">Eric the Victorious</a>. Özurr had entered into the service of a more powerful liege and died for the <a href="Byzantine%20Emperor">Byzantine Emperor</a>. Halfdan may have died either on <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> or in a <a href="holmgang">holmgang</a>, whereas where Kári died remains uncertain. The most likely interpretation may be that he died on Od, the old name for the <a href="Odsherred">north-western cape of Zealand</a>, but it is also possible that it was at <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a> in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Búi's location of death is not given, but Larsson (2002) comments that it was probably in a way that was not considered as glorious as those of his brothers.

The stone is high and wide at its base. The toponym "Haðistaðir", which is mentioned in the inscription, refers to modern Haddestad in the vicinity, and it also appears to mention Greece as the location where the deceased died, and it was probably as a member of the Varangian guard. Additionally, the last part of the inscription that mentions the location of his death is probably a poem in fornyrðislag.

The stone consists of flaking gneiss measuring in height and in width.

The oldest annotation of the stone is in a church inventory from 1829, and it says that the stone was illegible. Ljungström documented in 1861 that it was in the rock fence with the inscription facing the cemetery. When Djurklou visited the stone in 1869, it was still in the same spot. Djurklou considered its placement to be unhelpful because a part of the runic band was buried in the soil, so he commanded an honourable farmer to select a group of men and remove the stone from the wall. The next time Djurklou visited the location, he found the stone raised in the cemetery.

The stone was already in a ruined state when Rogberg depicted the stone in 1763. Rogberg noted that it had been used as a bridge across a brook and because of this the runes had been worn down so much that most of them were virtually illegible, a statement that is contradicted by later depictions. Since the runestone had passed unnoticed by the runologists of the 17th century, it is likely that it was used as a bridge. In a traveller's journal written in 1792 by Hilfeling, the bottom part of the stone is depicted for the first time, though the artist does not appear to have realised that the two parts belonged together. In 1822, Liljegren arrived to depict it. A surviving yet unsigned drawing is attributed to Liljegren ("see illustration"). In 1922, the runologist Kinander learnt from a local farmer that some 40 years earlier, the runestone had been seen walled into a bridge that was part of the country road, and the inscription had been upwards. Someone had decided to remove the runestone from the bridge and put it beside the road. Kinander wanted to see the stone and was shown a large worn down stone in the garden of Eriksstad. However, according to Kinander it was not possible to find any remaining runes on what was supposed to be the runestone.

Only one runestone mentioning the Byzantine Empire has been found on <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>.

It has been dated to the late 11th century, and although the interpretation of its message is uncertain, scholars have generally accepted von Friesen's analysis that it commemorates the travels of two Gotlanders to Greece, Jerusalem, Iceland and the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> world ("<a href="Serkland">Serkland</a>").

The inscription created a sensation as it mentions four distant countries that were the targets of adventurous Scandinavian expeditions during the Viking Age, but it also stirred some doubts as to its authenticity. However, thorough geological and runological analyses dispelled any doubts as to its genuine nature. The stone had the same <a href="patina">patina</a> as other Viking Age stones on all its surfaces and carvings, and in addition it has the normal <a href="Raido">r-rune</a> with an open side stroke, something which is usually overlooked by forgerers. Moreover, v Friesen commented that there could be no expert on Old Swedish that made a forgery while he correctly wrote krikiaʀ as all reference books of the time incorrectly told that the form was "grikir".

Jansson, Wessén & Svärdström (1978) comment that the personal name that is considered most interesting by scholars is "Ormika", which is otherwise only known from the "<a href="Gutasaga">Gutasaga</a>", where it was the name of a free farmer who was baptised by the Norwegian king <a href="Olaf%20II%20of%20Norway">Saint Olaf</a> in 1029.

The runologists appreciate the appearance of the nominative form "Grikkiaʀ" ("Greece") as it is otherwise unattested while other case forms are found on a number of runestones. The place name <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> appears in the <a href="Old%20Gutnish">Old Gutnish</a> form iaursaliʀ while the western-most dialect of Old Norse, Old Icelandic, has "Jórsalir", and both represent a Scandinavian <a href="Folk%20etymology">folk etymological</a> rendering where the first element is interpreted as the name element "jór-" (from an older *"eburaz" meaning "boar"). The inscription also shows the only runic appearance of the name of <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, while there are five other runic inscriptions in Sweden that mention Serkland.

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and The Five

In mid- to late-19th-century Russia, <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a> and a group of <a href="composer">composer</a>s known as <a href="The%20Five%20%28composers%29">The Five</a> had differing opinions as to whether should be composed following Western or native practices. Tchaikovsky wanted to write professional compositions of such quality that they would stand up to Western scrutiny and thus transcend national barriers, yet remain distinctively Russian in melody, rhythm and other compositional characteristics. The Five, made up of composers <a href="Mily%20Balakirev">Mily Balakirev</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Borodin">Alexander Borodin</a>, <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Cui">César Cui</a>, <a href="Modest%20Mussorgsky">Modest Mussorgsky</a>, and <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov</a>, sought to produce a specifically Russian kind of art music, rather than one that imitated older European music or relied on European-style conservatory training. While Tchaikovsky himself used folk songs in some of his works, for the most part he tried to follow Western practices of composition, especially in terms of tonality and tonal progression. Also, unlike Tchaikovsky, none of The Five were academically trained in composition; in fact, their leader, Balakirev, considered academicism a threat to musical imagination. Along with critic <a href="Vladimir%20Stasov">Vladimir Stasov</a>, who supported The Five, Balakirev attacked relentlessly both the <a href="Saint%20Petersburg%20Conservatory">Saint Petersburg Conservatory</a>, from which Tchaikovsky had graduated, and its founder <a href="Anton%20Rubinstein">Anton Rubinstein</a>, orally and in print.

As Tchaikovsky had become Rubinstein's best-known student, he was initially considered by association as a natural target for attack, especially as fodder for Cui's printed critical reviews. This attitude changed slightly when Rubinstein left the Saint Petersburg musical scene in 1867. In 1869 Tchaikovsky entered into a working relationship with Balakirev; the result was Tchaikovsky's first recognized masterpiece, the fantasy-overture "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">Romeo and Juliet</a>", a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced. When Tchaikovsky wrote a positive review of Rimsky-Korsakov's "<a href="Fantasy%20on%20Serbian%20Themes">Fantasy on Serbian Themes</a>" he was welcomed into the circle, despite concerns about the academic nature of his musical background. The finale of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">Second Symphony</a>, nicknamed the "Little Russian", was also received enthusiastically by the group on its first performance in 1872.

Tchaikovsky remained friendly but never intimate with most of The Five, ambivalent about their music; their goals and aesthetics did not match his. He took pains to ensure his musical independence from them as well as from the conservative faction at the Conservatory—an outcome facilitated by his acceptance of a professorship at the <a href="Moscow%20Conservatory">Moscow Conservatory</a> offered to him by <a href="Nikolai%20Rubinstein">Nikolai Rubinstein</a>, Anton's brother. When Rimsky-Korsakov was offered a professorship at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, it was to Tchaikovsky that he turned for advice and guidance. Later, when Rimsky-Korsakov was under pressure from his fellow nationalists for his change in attitude on music education and his own intensive studies in music, Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, told him that he fully applauded what he was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. In the 1880s, long after the members of The Five had gone their separate ways, another group called the <a href="Belyayev%20circle">Belyayev circle</a> took up where they left off. Tchaikovsky enjoyed close relations with the leading members of this group—<a href="Alexander%20Glazunov">Alexander Glazunov</a>, <a href="Anatoly%20Lyadov">Anatoly Lyadov</a> and, by then, Rimsky-Korsakov.

With the exception of <a href="Mikhail%20Glinka">Mikhail Glinka</a>, who became the first "truly Russian" composer, the only music indigenous to Russia before Tchaikovsky's birthday in 1840 were <a href="Folk%20music">folk</a> and sacred music; the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>'s proscription of secular music had effectively stifled its development. Beginning in the 1830s, Russian <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a> debated the issue of whether artists negated their Russianness when they borrowed from European culture or took vital steps toward renewing and developing Russian culture. Two groups sought to answer this question. <a href="Slavophile">Slavophile</a>s idealized Russian history before Peter the Great and claimed the country possessed a distinct culture, rooted in <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> and spread by the Russian Orthodox Church. The "Zapadniki" ("Westernizers"), on the other hand, lauded Peter as a patriot who wanted to reform his country and bring it on a par with Europe. Looking forward instead of backward, they saw Russia as a youthful and inexperienced but with the potential of becoming the most advanced European civilization by borrowing from Europe and turning its liabilities into assets.

In 1836, Glinka's opera "<a href="A%20Life%20for%20the%20Tsar">A Life for the Tsar</a>" was premiered in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. This was an event long-awaited by the intelligentsia. The opera was the first conceived by a Russian composer on a grand scale, set to a Russian text and patriotic in its appeal. Its plot fit neatly into the doctrine of <a href="Orthodoxy%2C%20Autocracy%2C%20and%20Nationality">Official Nationality</a> being promulgated by <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Nicholas I</a>, thus assuring Imperial approval. In formal and stylistic terms, "A Life" was very much an Italian opera but also showed a sophisticated thematic structure and a boldness in <a href="Orchestration">orchestral scoring</a>. It was the first tragic opera to enter the Russian repertoire, with <a href="Ivan%20Susanin">Ivan Susanin</a>'s death at the end underlining and adding gravitas to the patriotism running through the whole opera. (In Cavos's version, Ivan is spared at the last minute.) It was also the first Russian opera where the music continued throughout, uninterrupted by spoken dialogue. Moreover—and this is what amazed contemporaries about the work—the music included folk songs and Russian national idioms, incorporating them into the drama. Glinka meant his use of folk songs to reflect the presence of popular characters in the opera, rather than an overt attempt at nationalism. Nor do they play a major part in the opera. Nevertheless, despite a few derogatory comments about Glinka's use of "coachman's music," "A Life" became popular enough to earn obtain permanent repertory status, the first Russian opera to do so in that country.

Ironically, the success of <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Rossini</a>'s "<a href="Semiramide">Semiramide</a>" earlier the same season was what allowed "A Life" to be staged at all, with virtually all the cast from "Semiramide" retained for "A Life". Despite "A Life's" success, the furor over "Semiramide" aroused an overwhelming demand for Italian opera. This proved a setback for Russian opera in general and particularly for Glinka's next opera, "<a href="Ruslan%20and%20Lyudmila%20%28opera%29">Ruslan and Lyudmila</a>" when it was produced in 1842. Its failure prompted Glinka to leave Russia; he died in exile.

Despite Glinka's international attention, which included the admiration of <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a> and <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a> for his music and his heralding by the latter as "among the outstanding composers of his time", Russian aristocrats remained focused exclusively on foreign music. Music itself was bound by class structure, and except for a modest role in public life was still considered a privilege of the aristocracy. Nobles spent enormous sums on musical performances for their exclusive enjoyment and hosted visiting artists such as <a href="Clara%20Schumann">Clara Schumann</a> and Franz Liszt but there were no ongoing concert societies, no critical press and no public eagerly anticipating new works. No competent level of music education existed. Private tutors were available in some cities but tended to be badly trained. Anyone desiring a quality education had to travel abroad. Composer and pianist <a href="Anton%20Rubinstein">Anton Rubinstein</a>'s founding of the <a href="Russian%20Musical%20Society">Russian Musical Society</a> in 1859 and the <a href="Saint%20Petersburg%20Conservatory">Saint Petersburg Conservatory</a> three years later were giant steps toward remedying this situation but also proved highly controversial ones. Among this group was a young legal clerk named Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in <a href="Votkinsk">Votkinsk</a>, a small town in present-day <a href="Udmurtia">Udmurtia</a>, formerly the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Imperial Russian</a> province of <a href="Kirov%20Oblast">Vyatka</a>. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, from his family home in <a href="Alapayevsk">Alapayevsk</a>. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.

Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, <a href="Vincenzo%20Bellini">Bellini</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a> and <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.

Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.

In 1861, Tchaikovsky attended classes in <a href="music%20theory">music theory</a> organized by the Russian Musical Society and taught by <a href="Nikolai%20Zaremba">Nikolai Zaremba</a>. A year later he followed Zaremba to the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Tchaikovsky would not give up his Ministry post "until I am quite certain that I am destined to be a musician rather than a civil servant." From 1862 to 1865 he studied <a href="harmony">harmony</a>, <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> and <a href="fugue">fugue</a> with Zaremba, while Rubinstein taught him instrumentation and composition. In 1863 he abandoned his civil service career and studied music full-time, graduating in December 1865.

Around Christmas 1855, Glinka was visited by <a href="Alexander%20Ulybyshev">Alexander Ulybyshev</a>, a rich Russian amateur critic, and his 18-year-old protégé Mily Balakirev, who was reportedly on his way to becoming a great pianist. Balakirev played his fantasy based on themes from "A Life for the Tsar" for Glinka. Glinka, pleasantly surprised, praised Balakirev as a musician with a bright future.

In 1856, Balakirev and critic Vladimir Stasov, who publicly espoused a nationalist agenda for Russian arts, started gathering young composers through whom to spread ideas and gain a following. First to meet with them that year was César Cui, an army officer who specialized in the science of fortifications. Modest Mussorgsky, a <a href="Preobrazhensky%20Regiment">Preobrazhensky Lifeguard</a> officer, joined them in 1857; Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, a naval cadet, in 1861; and Alexander Borodin, a chemist, in 1862. Balakirev, Borodin, Cui, Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov composed in their spare time, and all five of them were young men in 1862, with Rimsky-Korsakov at just 18 the youngest and Borodin the oldest at 28. All five were essentially self-taught and eschewed conservative and "routine" musical techniques. They became known as the "kuchka", variously translated as The Five, The Russian Five and The Mighty Handful after a review written by Stasov about their music. Stasov wrote, "May God grant that [the audience retains] for ever a memory of how much poetry, feeling, talent and ability is possessed by the small but already mighty handful ["moguchaya kuchka"] of Russian musicians". The term "moguchaya kuchka", which literally means "mighty little heap", stuck, although Stasov referred to them in print generally as the "New Russian School."

The aim of this group was to create an independent Russian school of music in the footsteps of Glinka. They were to strive for "national character," gravitate toward "Oriental" (by that they meant near-Eastern) melodies and favor program music over <a href="Absolute%20music">absolute</a>—in other words, <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a>s and related music over symphonies, concertos and chamber music. To create this Russian style of classical music, Stasov wrote that the group incorporated four characteristics. The first was a rejection of academicism and fixed Western forms of composition. The second was the incorporation of musical elements from eastern nations inside the Russian empire; this was a quality that would later become known as musical orientalism. The third was a progressive and anti-academic approach to music. The fourth was the incorporation of compositional devices linked with folk music. These four points would distinguish the Five from its contemporaries in the cosmopolitan camp of composition.

Anton Rubinstein was a famous Russian pianist who had lived, performed and composed in Western and Central Europe before he returned to Russia in 1858. He saw Russia as a musical desert compared to <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> and <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, whose music conservatories he had visited. Musical life flourished in those places; composers were held in high regard, and musicians were wholeheartedly devoted to their art. With a similar ideal in mind for Russia, he had conceived an idea for a conservatory in Russia years before his 1858 return, and had finally aroused the interest of influential people to help him realize the idea.

Rubinstein's first step was to found the <a href="Russian%20Musical%20Society">Russian Musical Society</a> (RMS) in 1859. Its objectives were to educate people in music, cultivate their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives. The first priority of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers. In addition to a considerable amount of Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the <a href="Saint%20Petersburg%20Conservatory">Saint Petersburg Conservatory</a> in 1862.

According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein could not be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and progress in musical life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservative—from <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>, Mozart and <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a> to the early <a href="Romantic%20music">Romantics</a> up to <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a>. Liszt and <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a> were not included. Neither did he welcome many ideas then new about music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music existed only in folk song and folk dance. There was no place for national music in larger works, especially not in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction to the attacks was simply not to react. His classes and concerts were well attended, so he felt no reply was actually necessary. He even forbade his students to take sides.

As The Five's campaign against Rubinstein continued in the press, Tchaikovsky found himself almost as much a target as his former teacher. Cui reviewed the performance of Tchaikovsky's graduation <a href="cantata">cantata</a> and lambasted the composer as "utterly feeble... If he had any talent at all ... it would surely at some point in the piece have broken free of the chains imposed by the Conservatory." The review's effect on the sensitive composer was devastating. Eventually, an uneasy truce developed as Tchaikovsky became friendly with Balakirev and eventually with the other four composers of the group. A working relationship between Balakirev and Tchaikovsky resulted in "Romeo and Juliet". The Five's approval of this work was further followed by their enthusiasm for Tchaikovsky's <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">Second Symphony</a>. Subtitled the "Little Russian" (Little Russia was the term at that time for what is now called the <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>) for its use of Ukrainian folk songs, the symphony in its initial version also used several compositional devices similar to those used by the Five in their work. Stasov suggested the subject of Shakespeare's "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>" to Tchaikovsky, who wrote a <a href="The%20Tempest%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">tone poem</a> based on this subject. After a lapse of several years, Balakirev reentered Tchaikovsky's creative life; the result was Tchaikovsky's <a href="Manfred%20Symphony">"Manfred" Symphony</a>, composed to a program after <a href="George%20Gordon%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron">Lord Byron</a> originally written by Stasov and supplied by Balakirev. Overall, however, Tchaikovsky continued down an independent creative path, traveling a middle course between those of his nationalistic peers and the traditionalists.

In 1867, Rubinstein handed over the directorship of the Conservatory to Zaremba. Later that year he resigned his conductorship of the Russian Music Society orchestra, to be replaced by Balakirev. Tchaikovsky had already promised his "Characteristic Dances" (then called "Dances of the Hay Maidens") from his opera "<a href="The%20Voyevoda%20%28opera%29">The Voyevoda</a>" to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word of encouragement should the "Dances" not be performed.

At this point The Five as a unit was dispersing. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov wanted to remove themselves from Balakirev's influence, which they now found stifling, and go in their individual directions as composers. Balakirev might have sensed a potential new disciple in Tchaikovsky. He explained in his reply from Saint Petersburg that while he preferred to give his opinions in person and at length to press his points home, he was couching his reply "with complete frankness", adding, with a deft touch of flattery, that he felt that Tchaikovsky was "a fully fledged artist" and that he looked forward to discussing the piece with him on an upcoming trip to Moscow.

These letters set the tone for Tchaikovsky's relationship with Balakirev over the next two years. At the end of this period, in 1869, Tchaikovsky was a 28-year-old professor at the <a href="Moscow%20Conservatory">Moscow Conservatory</a>. Having written his <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">first symphony</a> and an opera, he next composed a <a href="symphonic%20poem">symphonic poem</a> entitled "<a href="Fatum%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">Fatum</a>". Initially pleased with the piece when <a href="Nikolai%20Rubinstein">Nikolai Rubinstein</a> conducted it in Moscow, Tchaikovsky dedicated it to Balakirev and sent it to him to conduct in Saint Petersburg. "Fatum" received only a lukewarm reception there. Balakirev wrote a detailed letter to Tchaikovsky in which he explained what he felt were defects in "Fatum" but also gave some encouragement. He added that he considered the dedication of the music to him as "precious to me as a sign of your sympathy towards me—and I feel a great weakness for you". Tchaikovsky was too self-critical not to see the truth behind these comments. He accepted Balakirev's criticism, and the two continued to correspond. Tchaikovsky would later destroy the score of "Fatum". (The score would be reconstructed posthumously by using the orchestral parts.)

Balakirev's despotism strained the relationship between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">Romeo and Juliet</a>". At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's "King Lear", a tragic overture in <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a> after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the <a href="binary%20form">binary structure</a> of <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a>. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

Tchaikovsky allowed the first version to be premiered by Nikolai Rubinstein on March 16, 1870, after the composer had incorporated only some of Balakirev's suggestions. The premiere was a disaster. Stung by this rejection, Tchaikovsky took Balakirev's strictures to heart. He forced himself to reach beyond his musical training and rewrote much of the music into the form we know it today. "Romeo" would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the "kuchka" lauded unconditionally. On hearing the love theme from "Romeo", Stasov told the group, "There were five of you; now there are six". Such was the enthusiasm of the Five for "Romeo" that at their gatherings Balakirev was always asked to play it through at the piano. He did this so many times that he learned to perform it from memory.

Some critics, among them Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have wondered what would have happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write "Romeo". How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at <a href="orchestration">orchestration</a>, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might not have been able to write what would become his greatest works.

In 1871, <a href="Nikolai%20Zaremba">Nikolai Zaremba</a> resigned from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His successor, <a href="Mikhail%20Azanchevsky">Mikhaíl Azanchevsky</a>, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood to freshen up teaching in the Conservatory. He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration), as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism with tremendous vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having one of his own in the midst of the enemy camp.
Nevertheless, by the time of his appointment, Rimsky-Korsakov had become painfully aware of his technical shortcomings as a composer; he later wrote, "I was a dilettante and knew nothing". Moreover, he had come to a creative dead-end upon completing his opera "<a href="The%20Maid%20of%20Pskov">The Maid of Pskov</a>" and realized that developing a solid musical technique was the only way he could continue composing. He turned to Tchaikovsky for advice and guidance. When Rimsky-Korsakov underwent a change in attitude on music education and began his own intensive studies privately, his fellow nationalists accused him of throwing away his Russian heritage to compose fugues and sonatas. Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally. He told Rimsky-Korsakov that he fully applauded what he was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character.

Before Rimsky-Korsakov went to the Conservatory, in March 1868, Tchaikovsky wrote a review of his "<a href="Fantasy%20on%20Serbian%20Themes">Fantasy on Serbian Themes</a>". In discussing this work, Tchaikovsky compared it to the only other Rimsky-Korsakov piece he had heard so far, the <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">First Symphony</a>, mentioning "its charming orchestration ... its structural novelty, and most of all ... the freshness of its purely Russian harmonic turns ... immediately [showing] Mr. Rimsky-Korsakov to be a remarkable symphonic talent". Tchaikovsky's notice, worded in precisely a way to find favor within the Balakirev circle, did exactly that. He met the rest of The Five on a visit to Balakirev's house in Saint Petersburg the following month. The meeting went well. Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote,

As a product of the Conservatory, Tchaikovsky was viewed rather negligently if not haughtily by our circle, and, owing to his being away from St. Petersburg, personal acquaintanceship was impossible... [Tchaikovsky] proved to be a pleasing and sympathetic man to talk with, one who knew how to be simple of manner and always speak with evident sincerity and heartiness. The evening of our first meeting [Tchaikovsky] played for us, at Balakirev's request, the first movement of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">Symphony in G minor [Tchaikovsky's First Symphony</a>]; it proved quite to our liking; and our former opinion of him changed and gave way to a more sympathetic one, although Tchaikovsky's Conservatory training still constituted a considerable barrier between him and us.

Rimsky-Korsakov added that "during the following years, when visiting St. Petersburg, [Tchaikovsky] usually came to Balakirev's, and we saw him." Nevertheless, as much as Tchaikovsky may have desired acceptance from both The Five and the traditionalists, he needed the independence that Moscow afforded to find his own direction, away from both parties. This was especially true in light of Rimsky-Korsakov's comment about the "considerable barrier" of Tchaikovsky's Conservatory training, as well as Anton Rubinstein's opinion that Tchaikovsky had strayed too far from the examples of the great Western masters. Tchaikovsky was ready for the nourishment of new attitudes and styles so he could continue growing as a composer, and his brother <a href="Modest%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Modest</a> writes that he was impressed by the "force and vitality" in some of the Five's work. However, he was too balanced an individual to totally reject the best in the music and values that Zaremba and Rubinstein had cherished. In his brother Modest's opinion, Tchaikovsky's relations with the Saint Petersburg group resembled "those between two friendly neighboring states ... cautiously prepared to meet on common ground, but jealously guarding their separate interests".

Tchaikovsky played the finale of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">Second Symphony</a>, subtitled the "Little Russian", at a gathering at Rimsky-Korsakov's house in Saint Petersburg on January 7, 1873, before the official premiere of the entire work. To his brother Modest, he wrote, "[T]he whole company almost tore me to pieces with rapture—and <a href="Nadezhda%20Rimskaya-Korsakova">Madame Rimskaya-Korsakova</a> begged me in tears to let her arrange it for piano duet". Rimskaya-Korsakova was a noted pianist, composer and arranger in her own right, transcribing works by other members of the "kuchka" as well as those of her husband and Tchaikovsky's "Romeo and Juliet". Borodin was present and may have approved of the work himself. Also present was Vladimir Stasov. Impressed by what he had heard, Stasov asked Tchaikovsky what he would consider writing next, and would soon influence the composer in writing the symphonic poem "<a href="The%20Tempest%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">The Tempest</a>".

What endeared the "Little Russian" to the "kuchka" was not simply that Tchaikovsky had used Ukrainian folk songs as melodic material. It was how, especially in the outer movements, he allowed the unique characteristics of <a href="Ethnic%20Russian%20music">Russian folk song</a> to dictate <a href="Symphony">symphonic form</a>. This was a goal toward which the "kuchka" strived, both collectively and individually. Tchaikovsky, with his Conservatory grounding, could sustain such development longer and more cohesively than his colleagues in the "kuchka". (Though the comparison may seem unfair, Tchaikovsky authority <a href="David%20Brown%20%28musicologist%29">David Brown</a> has pointed out that, because of their similar time-frames, the finale of the "Little Russian" shows what Mussorgsky could have done with "The Great Gate of Kiev" from "<a href="Pictures%20at%20an%20Exhibition">Pictures at an Exhibition</a>" had he possessed academic training comparable to that of Tchaikovsky.)

The Five was among the myriad of subjects Tchaikovsky discussed with his benefactress, <a href="Nadezhda%20von%20Meck">Nadezhda von Meck</a>. By January 1878, when he wrote to Mrs. von Meck about its members, he had drifted far from their musical world and ideals. In addition, The Five's finest days had long passed. Despite considerable effort in writing operas and songs, Cui had become better known as a critic than as a composer, and even his critical efforts competed for time with his career as an army engineer and expert in the science of <a href="fortification">fortification</a>. Balakirev had withdrawn completely from the musical scene, Mussorgsky was sinking ever deeper into alcoholism, and Borodin's creative activities increasingly took a back seat to his official duties as a professor of chemistry.

Only Rimsky-Korsakov actively pursued a full-time musical career, and he was under increasing fire from his fellow nationalists for much the same reason as Tchaikovsky had been. Like Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov had found that, for his own artistic growth to continue unabated, he had to study and master Western classical forms and techniques. Borodin called it "<a href="apostasy">apostasy</a>", adding, "Many are grieved at present by the fact that Korsakov has turned back, has thrown himself into a study of musical antiquity. I do not bemoan it. It is understandable..." Mussorgsky was harsher: "[T]he mighty "kuchka" had degenerated into soulless traitors."

Tchaikovsky's analysis of each of The Five was unsparing. While at least some of his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions some details which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not appreciate the forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping "Romeo and Juliet".

Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that all of the "kuchka" were talented but also "infected to the core" with conceit and "a purely dilettantish confidence in their superiority." He went into some detail about Rimsky-Korsakov's epiphany and turnaround regarding musical training, and his efforts to remedy this situation for himself. Tchaikovsky then called Cui "a talented dilettante" whose music "has no originality, but is clever and graceful"; Borodin a man who "has talent, even a strong one, but it has perished through neglect ... and his technique is so weak that he cannot write a single line [of music] without outside help"; Mussorgsky "a hopeless case", superior in talent but "narrow-minded, devoid of any urge towards self-perfection"; and Balakirev as one with "enormous talent" yet who had also "done much harm" as "the general inventor of all the theories of this strange group".

Tchaikovsky finished his final revision of "Romeo and Juliet" in 1880, and felt it a courtesy to send a copy of the score to Balakirev. Balakirev, however, had dropped out of the music scene in the early 1870s and Tchaikovsky had lost touch with him. He asked the publisher <a href="V.%20Bessel%20and%20Co.">Bessel</a> to forward a copy to Balakirev. A year later Balakirev replied. In the same letter that he thanked Tchaikovsky profusely for the score, Balakirev suggested "the programme for a symphony which you would handle wonderfully well", a detailed plan for a symphony based on <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>'s "<a href="Manfred">Manfred</a>". Originally drafted by Stasov in 1868 for <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a> as a sequel to that composer's "<a href="Harold%20en%20Italie">Harold en Italie</a>", the program had since been in Balakirev's care.
Tchaikovsky declined the project at first, saying the subject left him cold. Balakirev persisted. "You must, of course, "make an effort"", Balakirev exhorted, "take a more self-critical approach, don't hurry things". Tchaikovsky's mind was changed two years later, in the Swiss Alps, while tending to his friend <a href="Iosif%20Kotek">Iosif Kotek</a> and after he had re-read "Manfred" in the milieu in which the poem is set. Once he returned home, Tchaikovsky revised the draft Balakirev had made from Stasov's program and began sketching the first movement.

The "Manfred" Symphony would cost Tchaikovsky more time, effort and soul-searching than anything else he would write, even the <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">"Pathetique" Symphony</a>. It also became the longest, most complex work he had written up to that point, and though it owes an obvious debt to Berlioz due to its program, Tchaikovsky was still able to make the theme of "Manfred" his own. Near the end of seven months of intensive effort, in late September 1885, he wrote Balakirev, "Never in my life, believe me, have I labored so long and hard, and felt so drained by my efforts. The Symphony is written in four movements, as per your program, although—forgive me—as much as I wanted to, I have not been able to keep all the keys and modulations you suggested ... It is of course dedicated to you".

Once he had finished the symphony, Tchaikovsky was reluctant to further tolerate Balakirev's interference, and severed all contact; he told his publisher <a href="P.%20Jurgenson">P. Jurgenson</a> that he considered Balakirev a "madman". Tchaikovsky and Balakirev exchanged only a few formal, not overly friendly letters after this breach.

In November 1887, Tchaikovsky arrived in Saint Petersburg in time to hear several of the <a href="Russian%20Symphony%20Concerts">Russian Symphony Concerts</a>, one of which included the first complete performance of the final version of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">First Symphony</a> and another the premiere of the revised version of Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony. Before this visit he had spent much time keeping in touch with Rimsky-Korsakov and those around him. Rimsky-Korsakov, along with <a href="Alexander%20Glazunov">Alexander Glazunov</a>, <a href="Anatoly%20Lyadov">Anatol Lyadov</a> and several other nationalistically-minded composers and musicians, had formed a group called the <a href="Belyayev%20circle">Belyayev circle</a>. This group was named after timber merchant <a href="Mitrofan%20Belyayev">Mitrofan Belyayev</a>, an amateur musician who became an influential music patron and publisher after he had taken an interest in Glazunov's work. During Tchaikovsky's visit, he spent much time in the company of these men, and his somewhat fraught relationship with The Five would meld into a more harmonious one with the Belyayev circle. This relationship would last until his death in late 1893.

As for The Five, the group had long since dispersed, Mussorgsky had died in 1881 and Borodin had followed in 1887. Cui continued to write negative reviews of Tchaikovsky's music but was seen by the composer as merely a critical irritant. Balakirev lived in isolation and was confined to the musical sidelines. Only Rimsky-Korsakov remained fully active as a composer.

A side benefit of Tchaikovsky's friendship with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov was an increased confidence in his own abilities as a composer, along with a willingness to let his musical works stand alongside those of his contemporaries. Tchaikovsky wrote to von Meck in January 1889, after being once again well represented in Belyayev's concerts, that he had "always tried to place myself "outside" all parties and to show in every way possible that I love and respect every honorable and gifted public figure in music, whatever his tendency", and that he considered himself "flattered to appear on the concert platform" beside composers in the Belyayev circle. This was an acknowledgment of wholehearted readiness for his music to be heard with that of these composers, delivered in a tone of implicit confidence that there were no comparisons from which to fear.

The initial hostility of The Five against Tchaikovsky was mitigated by Tchaikovsky's improved relationships, first with Balakirev and then with Rimsky-Korsakov. The latter substantially embraced the cosmopolitan conservatory-based approach, as distinct from pure Russian nationalism. The Five dispersed as a unit, but were replaced by the Belyayev circle of younger composers that grew around Rimsky-Korsakov. This group, while writing in a nationalistic style pioneered by Rimsky-Korsakov and Balakirev, was much more accommodating of Western compositional practices as personified by the music of Tchaikovsky. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote about this tendency:

At this time [approximately 1892] there begins to be noticeable a considerable cooling off and even somewhat inimical attitude toward the memory of the "mighty "kuchka"" of Balakirev's period. On the contrary a worship of Tchaikovsky and a tendency toward <a href="eclecticism">eclecticism</a> grow even stronger. Nor could one help noticing the predilection (that sprang up then in our circle) for Italian-French music of the time of wig and <a href="farthingale">farthingale</a> [that is, the eighteenth century], music introduced by Tchaikovsky in his "<a href="The%20Queen%20of%20Spades%20%28opera%29">Queen of Spades</a>" and "<a href="Iolanta">Iolanthe</a>". By this time quite an accretion of new elements and young blood had accumulated in Belyayev's circle. New times, new birds, new songs.

As a result of this influence plus their academic training from Rimsky-Korsakov, especially in the cases of <a href="Anton%20Arensky">Anton Arensky</a> and Glazunov, these composers combined the best compositional techniques of The Five and Tchaikovsky in their music. Often, however, composers in this group fell back on two sources—musical clichés and mannerisms handed down from The Five, and academic compositional techniques learned at the Conservatory. Also, the eclecticism about which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote tended to overpower originality in many works, including those of Glazunov. Nevertheless, the Belyayev circle continued to influence the development of Russian music well into the 20th century.

SMS "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was a German <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a> of the , built around the turn of the 20th century for the "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy). Named for the <a href="Charlemagne">Emperor Charlemagne</a>, "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was built in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, at the <a href="Blohm%20%2B%20Voss">Blohm and Voss</a> shipyard. She was laid down in September 1898 and launched in October 1899. A shipyard <a href="Strike%20action">strike</a> and an accidental grounding delayed her completion until February 1902; she was therefore the last member of her class to enter service. The ship was armed with four guns in two twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s and had a top speed of .

"Kaiser Karl der Grosse" served with the active fleet until 1908, participating in the normal peacetime routine of training cruises and fleet maneuvers. By 1908, the new "all-big-gun" <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s were entering service. As these rendered her obsolete, "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was withdrawn from active service and placed in the Reserve Division. At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August 1914, the ship was placed back in active duty as a <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> in the <a href="V%20Battle%20Squadron">V Battle Squadron</a>, though by February 1915 she was again placed in reserve. "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was briefly used as a training ship and ended her career as a prison ship for <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>. After the German defeat in November 1918, she was sold to <a href="ship-breaker">ship-breaker</a>s and scrapped in 1920.

After the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The Secretary of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office), "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hollmann">Friedrich von Hollmann</a> struggled throughout the early- and mid-1890s to secure parliamentary approval for the s, but in June 1897, Hollmann was replaced by "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" (Rear Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>, who quickly proposed and secured approval for the first <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Naval Law</a> in early 1898. The law authorized the last two ships of the class, "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" and .

"Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward and aft. She displaced up to at full load. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple-expansion%20engine">triple-expansion</a> <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a>s, each driving one screw propeller. Steam was provided by four Marine-type and eight cylindrical boilers, all of which burned coal. "Kaiser Karl der Grosse"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She had a normal complement of 39 officers and 612 enlisted men.

The ship's armament consisted of a <a href="Artillery%20battery%23Naval%20usage">main battery</a> of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40</a> guns and twelve <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30</a> quick-firing guns mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s. The armament suite was rounded out with six 45 cm <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all in above-water swivel mounts. The ship's <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was thick, and the <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was thick. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> and main battery turrets were protected with of armor plating, and the secondary casemates received of armor protection.

German Emperor ("Kaiser") <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm II</a> believed that a strong navy was necessary for the country to expand its influence outside continental Europe. As a result, he initiated a program of naval expansion in the late 1880s; the first battleships built under this program were the four "Brandenburg"-class ships. These were immediately followed by the five "Kaiser Friedrich III"-class battleships, of which "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was a member. She was ordered under the contract name "B" as a new ship of the fleet. The ship's keel was laid on 17 September 1898 at the <a href="Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss">Blohm & Voss</a> in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> under <a href="yard%20number">yard number</a> 136. She was the first <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a> to be built by the yard and the second warship of any type. The new battleship was launched on 18 October 1899 and named for <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> (Karl der Grosse in German); Wilhelm II gave the launching speech and <a href="Johann%20Georg%20M%C3%B6nckeberg">Johann Georg Mönckeberg</a>, the "<a href="Government%20of%20Hamburg%23Executive">Erster Bürgermeister</a>" (First Mayor) of Hamburg, christened the ship. A major strike by shipyard workers in late 1900 significantly delayed completion of the ship. In October 1901, a shipyard crew took the ship to the naval base at <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>, though while en route she ran aground in the lower <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> river. The hull was damaged in the incident and the necessary repairs further delayed her entry into service; she was not commissioned until 4 February 1902.

"Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was assigned to the II Division of the I Squadron on 19 February, the last member of her class to enter active service. With the assignment of "Kaiser Karl der Grosse", the I Squadron was now fully composed of modern battleships. The squadron went on a training cruise to Britain in April and May, followed by a tour of the <a href="Kiel%20Week">Kiel Week</a> sailing <a href="regatta">regatta</a> in late June. The ships then took part in another training cruise to Norway in July and then the autumn maneuvers, which began in the Baltic on 31 August. During the exercises, "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was assigned to the "<a href="Opfor">hostile</a>" force, as were several of her sister ships. The "hostile" force was first tasked with preventing the "German" squadron from passing through the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a> in the Baltic. "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" and several other battleships were then tasked with forcing an entry into the mouth of the <a href="Elbe%20River">Elbe River</a>, where the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a> and Hamburg could be seized. The "hostile" flotilla accomplished these tasks within three days. The maneuvers concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade Bight</a>. From 1 to 12 December, the squadron went on its normal winter cruise to Norway.

In 1903, the fleet, which was composed of only one squadron of battleships (along with its attendant scouting vessels and <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s), was reorganized as the "Active Battle Fleet." "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" remained in the I Squadron along with her sister ships and the newest s, while the older "Brandenburg"-class ships were placed in <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> in order to be rebuilt. The first quarter of 1903 followed the usual pattern of training exercises. The squadron went on a training cruise in the Baltic, followed by a voyage to Spain that lasted from 7 May to 10 June. In July, she joined the I Squadron for the annual cruise to Norway. The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea, a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> in early September, and finally a mock attack on Kiel. The exercises concluded on 12 September. The winter training cruise began on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and continued into the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> in early December.

"Kaiser Karl der Grosse" participated in exercises in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904, with her squadron from 8 to 17 March, and with the fleet in the North Sea in May. In July, the I Squadron and the <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> visited Britain, including a stop at <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 10 July. The German fleet departed on 13 July, bound for the Netherlands; the I Squadron anchored in <a href="Vlissingen">Vlissingen</a> the following day, where the ships were visited by Queen <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Wilhelmina</a>. Departing on 20 July for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet, the squadron stopped in <a href="Molde">Molde</a>, Norway, nine days later while the other units went to other ports. The fleet reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August. Immediately after returning to Kiel, the fleet began preparations for the autumn maneuvers, which began on 29 August in the Baltic. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September, where it took part in a major <a href="amphibious%20warfare">landing operation</a>, after which the ships took the ground troops from the <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">IX Corps</a> that participated in the exercises to <a href="Altona%2C%20Hamburg">Altona</a> for a parade for Wilhelm II. The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> on 6 September. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it participated in further landing operations with the IX Corps and the <a href="Guards%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">Guards Corps</a>. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end. The I Squadron went on its winter training cruise, this time to the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.

In January and February 1905, "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" served briefly as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the squadron. During this period, she took part in a pair of training cruises with the I Squadron during 9–19 January and 27 February – 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. While on the cruise on 18 July, "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was detached to visit <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> to represent Germany during the celebrations for the 75th anniversary of the <a href="Belgian%20Revolution">Belgian Revolution</a>. The rest of the fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>; "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" rejoined them on 3 August in <a href="Karlskrona">Karlskrona</a>. The summer cruise ended on 9 August, though the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> that month.

The British fleet stopped in Danzig, <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>, and <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" and the main German fleet was anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit was strained by the growing <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">Anglo-German naval arms race</a>. As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers (6 to 13 September) were shortened considerably, consisting only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. In November, the I Squadron cruised in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. While on the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.

The fleet undertook a heavier training schedule in 1906 than in previous years. The ships were occupied with individual, division and squadron exercises throughout April. Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a> into the Baltic. The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July. "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" and the I Squadron anchored in Molde, where they were joined on 21 July by Wilhelm II aboard the steamer <a href="USS%20Powhatan%20%28ID-3013%29">SS "Hamburg"</a>. The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian king <a href="Haakon%20VII">Haakon VII</a> on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland to join exercises being conducted there, arriving back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22–24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde%20Bay">Eckernförde Bay</a> outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when Kiel hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days. The ship participated in the uneventful winter cruise into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December.

The first quarter of 1907 followed the previous pattern and, on 16 February, the Active Battlefleet was re-designated the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. From the end of May to early June the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea, returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat. This was followed by the regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August. During the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 26 August to 6 September, the fleet conducted landing exercises in northern <a href="Schleswig">Schleswig</a> with the IX Corps. The winter training cruise went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November. In May 1908, the fleet went on a major cruise into the Atlantic instead of its normal voyage in the North Sea. The fleet returned to Kiel on 13 August to prepare for the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 27 August to 7 September. Division exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September. Following the conclusion of these maneuvers, "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was decommissioned in Kiel on 18 September and assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic. During this period, her sister ships were rebuilt, though "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" did not receive this treatment. By this time, the new <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">"all-big-gun" battleships</a>, which rendered pre-dreadnoughts like "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" obsolete, began to enter service. In June and July 1911, the ship underwent a major <a href="%3Awikt%3Aoverhaul">overhaul</a>. By 1914, the ship had been assigned to the V Squadron of the Reserve Fleet, alongside her four sister ships and the battleship .

As a result of the outbreak of World War I, "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914. The ships were prepared for war very slowly, and they were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August. They were initially tasked with coastal defense, though they served in this capacity for a short time. In mid-September, the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic, under the command of <a href="Prince%20Heinrich">Prince Heinrich</a>. He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on <a href="Windau">Windau</a>, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, the V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed guard ship duties. Before the end of the year, the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic.

Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Pomerania">Bay of Pomerania</a> and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to <a href="%3Awikt%3Ashow%20the%20flag">show the German flag</a> and was back in Kiel by 30 December. "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" briefly replaced her sister as the squadron flagship, from 23 January 1915 to 23 February. The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from front-line service by February. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of "Kaiser der Grosse" and her sisters. Starting in October, she served briefly as a training ship for engine room personnel, though on 19 November she was decommissioned in Kiel and disarmed. She was thereafter employed as a prison ship for prisoners of war in Wilhelmshaven. In November 1918, Germany capitulated and signed the <a href="First%20Armistice%20at%20Compi%C3%A8gne">First Armistice at Compiègne</a>, which ended hostilities so a peace treaty could be negotiated. According to of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, signed on 28 June 1919, Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the " or <a href="Braunschweig-class%20battleship">"Lothringen"</a> types". On 6 December 1919, the ship was struck from the naval list and sold to ship-breakers. The following year, "Kaiser Karl der Grosse" was broken up for scrap metal in <a href="R%C3%B6nnebeck">Rönnebeck</a>.

History of Stoke City F.C.

<a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City Football Club</a> was formed in 1863 as Stoke Ramblers Football Club by former pupils of the <a href="Charterhouse%20School">Charterhouse School</a> whilst they were apprentices at the <a href="North%20Staffordshire%20Railway">North Staffordshire Railway</a>. The club dropped the Ramblers from their name in 1878, and in 1888 they were founding members of <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>. In 1925, the club's name was changed for the final time to Stoke City Football Club when <a href="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent</a> was granted <a href="City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">city status</a>.

The club moved in 1997 to the <a href="Britannia%20Stadium">Britannia Stadium</a>, a 28,383 <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a>; having spent 119 years at the <a href="Victoria%20Ground">Victoria Ground</a>. In the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a>, Stoke won promotion from the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Football League Championship</a>, the second tier of <a href="Football%20in%20England">English football</a>, and as of <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2008–09</a> are playing in the top flight (currently <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>) for the first time since the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1984–85 season</a>, when they were relegated with a total of 17 points, a record low unsurpassed for 21 years. Stoke's only major trophy was the 1972 <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a>, won when they beat <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> 2–1 in the <a href="1972%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> before a crowd of 97,852. The club have also won the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> twice, in <a href="1992%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">1992</a> and <a href="2000%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">2000</a>. In terms of league achievement the closest Stoke have come to winning the title was in the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1946–47 season</a> where a final day defeat cost Stoke top spot.

It is claimed that Stoke Ramblers was formed in 1863 when former pupils of <a href="Charterhouse%20School">Charterhouse School</a> formed a football club while they were apprentices at the <a href="North%20Staffordshire%20Railway">North Staffordshire Railway</a> works in <a href="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent</a>. However, Stoke Ramblers' first documented match was five years later, on 17 October 1868, at the club's original home, the Victoria Cricket Club ground against E.W May's XV, the 15-a-side match ended in a 1–1 draw. In the game, the club's first goal was scored by <a href="Henry%20John%20Almond">Henry Almond</a>, Stoke's founder and <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a>. Stoke played four further fixtures in 1868, recording their first victory with a 2–0 win against Newcastle-under-Lyme. In 1875, to cope with rising attendances, the club switched to a ground at Sweetings Field, not far from the Victoria Cricket Ground. At this time, the only fixtures were friendly matches; this changed in 1877 when the Staffordshire Football Association was formed and created a new competition, the County Cup, which Stoke won in the inaugural season, beating Talke Rangers 1–0 in the final. In an earlier round, Stoke had recorded what is still the club's record victory, a 26–0 triumph over Mow Cop. Stoke retained the County Cup in the following season with a 2–1 win over Cobridge and established themselves as the largest club in the area.
In 1878, the club merged with Stoke Victoria Athletic Club and became known as Stoke Football Club. They moved from Sweetings Field to the Athletic Club ground, which soon became known as the <a href="Victoria%20Ground">Victoria Ground</a>. It was around this time that the club adopted their red and white striped kit. Stoke entered the newly formed Birmingham Association Cup in 1881, although they were beaten 8–0 by <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> in the first round. In the <a href="1882%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football">1882–1883</a> season, Stoke reached the final of the <a href="Staffordshire%20Senior%20Cup">Staffordshire Senior Cup</a> but were beaten 3–2 by <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. The club decided to enter the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time in the <a href="1883%E2%80%9384%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1883–84</a> season; the competition itself had been founded 12 years earlier. The threat of a rival football association, the <a href="British%20Football%20Association">British FA</a>, forced <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> to legalise professionalism in 1885; Stoke subsequently turned professional in August of that year. The club were defeated again in the FA Cup in <a href="1885%E2%80%9386%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1885–86</a> after a replay defeat to <a href="Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.">Crewe Alexandra</a>. The club's first victory in the competition came in the <a href="1886%E2%80%9387%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1886–87 season</a> with a 10–0 win over Caernarfon Wanderers at the Victoria Ground.

Stoke became one of the twelve founding members of <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a> in 1888. Stoke's manager, Harry Lockett, represented the club at a meeting in London, where the league's formation was discussed. Lockett played an instrumental role in its inception and became the league's first secretary; however he resigned from his role of manager in August 1890, in order to concentrate on his league responsibilities. Stoke struggled in their first two seasons in the league, <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1888–89</a> and <a href="1889%E2%80%9390%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1889–90</a>, finishing in last place on both occasions. The club failed to secure re-election to the league at the end of its second season, instead being replaced by <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>. As a consequence, Stoke started <a href="1890%E2%80%9391%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1890–91</a> in the <a href="Football%20Alliance">Football Alliance</a>; they finished the season as champions. The Football League was expanded to include fourteen clubs in <a href="1891%E2%80%9392%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1891–92</a>, which ensured Stoke were re-elected to the league, where they remained for the rest of the decade.
In 1897, Stoke appointed <a href="Horace%20Austerberry">Horace Austerberry</a>, who in <a href="1898%E2%80%9399%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1898–99</a> became the first manager to lead the club to the semi-final of the FA Cup.

Stoke suffered financial problems around 1900, which ultimately led to the loss of the club's Football League status in 1908. "Historical Football Kits" says that, "In 1908, having finished in mid-table, Stoke went into liquidation and resigned from the League. Ironically this galvanised local businessmen, the clergy (the Victoria Ground was owned by the Church of England) and supporters to form a new limited company and purchase the old club's assets." The club moved to the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League%23Birmingham%20%26amp%3B%20District%20League">Birmingham & District League</a> after its demotion. In 1909, the club opted to field teams in two league competitions, one in the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28Regional%29%20League%23Birmingham%20%26amp%3B%20District%20League">Birmingham & District League</a> and the other in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>; Stoke won the latter in their first year in the competition. Stoke continued to participate in both leagues until 1915, when their application for election back into the Football League was approved. However, the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> meant the league was suspended for four years; it recommenced in August 1919. During this time, Stoke entered the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28football%29%23Lancashire%20League%20.281939%20to%20date.29">Lancashire Primary and Secondary leagues</a>.

The club became owners of the <a href="Victoria%20Ground%20%28Stoke%29">Victoria Ground</a> in 1919. The Butler Street stand was constructed shortly afterward, increasing the overall capacity of the ground to 50,000. Following the restart of the Football League, Stoke achieved promotion from the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in the <a href="1921%E2%80%9322%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1921–22 season</a> under the stewardship of Arthur Shallcross, although this was followed by relegation in the <a href="1922%E2%80%9323%20Stoke%20F.C.%20season">1922–23 season</a>. Unable to prevent the club's bad form, Shallcross resigned in March 1923. <a href="Tom%20Mather">Tom Mather</a> was appointed manager later in 1923, although Stoke were unable to mount another promotion challenge. They were instead relegated from the Second Division four years later in the <a href="1925%E2%80%9326%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1925–26 season</a>. The club's stay in <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20North">Third Division North</a> was brief, as Stoke won the championship during their first season in that league. In 1925, <a href="Stoke-on-Trent">Stoke-on-Trent</a> was granted <a href="City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">city status</a>, and this led the club to change its name to Stoke City Football Club.

The 1930s saw the début of the club's most celebrated player, <a href="Stanley%20Matthews">Stanley Matthews</a>. Matthews, who grew up in <a href="Hanley%2C%20Staffordshire">Hanley</a>, was an apprentice at the club and made his first appearance, aged 17, in March 1932 against <a href="Bury%20F.C.">Bury</a>. By end of the decade, Matthews had established himself as an <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England international</a> and one of the best footballers of his generation. Matthews won his first England cap in 1934, making him the first Stoke player in 30 years to play for England. Stoke achieved promotion from the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in the <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1932–33</a> season as champions, but Matthews only featured in 15 games, although he did score his first goal for the club in a 3–1 win against local rivals <a href="Port%20Vale%20F.C.">Port Vale</a>.

By 1934, the club's average attendance had risen to over 23,000, which allowed the club manager, Tom Mather, more transfer funds. Despite this, the core of the side consisted of young local players, such as Matthews, <a href="Tommy%20Sale">Tommy Sale</a> and <a href="Freddie%20Steele%20%28footballer%29">Freddie Steele</a>. Mathers resigned from his post in May 1935 to take the managerial job at <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>, ending his 12-year tenure. <a href="Bob%20McGrory">Bob McGrory</a> was appointed as the club's manager shortly afterward; he had previously played for the club for 14 years. In the <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1935–36</a> season, the club finished fourth in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Football League First Division</a>, nine points adrift of champions Sunderland. This was followed by two successive mid-table finishes, in <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1936–37</a> and <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1937–38</a>. The club recorded its record league win, 10–3, over <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> in February 1937, in which Steele scored five goals. In April of that year, the club achieved its largest league crowd—51,373 against <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>. Steele's 33 league goals in the <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1936–37 season</a> remains a club record in 2007.

By 1938, rumours purported that Stanley Matthews wanted to leave Stoke to further his career. This led to a meeting at Kings Hall, attended by three thousand people with a further thousand outside. Matthews opted to stay with Stoke and helped the club to finish in seventh place in the <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1938–39 season</a>. The outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> prevented further progress as the league was suspended for six years. After resumption of the FA Cup, 33 fans died and 520 were injured during a sixth round away game against <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> when the crush barriers gave way on the terraces.

At this time, the side was predominantly composed of local players who had come through the club's youth system, including Matthews, Sale, Steele and <a href="John%20McCue">John McCue</a>, all in their prime, as well as the newly discovered <a href="Neil%20Franklin">Neil Franklin</a>, regarded as the country's best <a href="centre-half">centre-half</a>. In the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1946–47 season</a>, Stoke mounted a serious title challenge: the club needed a win in their final game of the season to win the First Division title, but a 2–1 defeat to <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> gave the title to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Stanley Matthews left the club three games before the end of the 1946–47 season to join <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> at the age of 32 for a fee of £11,500. The team subsequently failed to mount a title challenge in the following two seasons, <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1947–48</a> and <a href="1948%E2%80%9349%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1948–49</a>, finishing 15th and 11th respectively.

The 1950s did not start well for the club; having avoided relegation in the <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1950–51</a> and <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1951–52</a> seasons, Stoke succumbed in <a href="1952%E2%80%9353%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1952–53</a>, finishing second from bottom. Bob McGrory resigned as the club's manager in February 1952 after 17 years in the role. His successor, Frank Taylor, consolidated the club's position in the Second Division but was unable to mount a sustained challenge for promotion, although Stoke came close in the <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1954–55 season</a>, missing by two points. Taylor's failure to deliver promotion led to his dismissal in June 1960, after a 17th-place finish in the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1959–60 season</a>.

By 1960 Stoke were struggling to attract supporters to the Victoria Ground, with the average attendance dropping below 10,000 for the first time in 40 years. <a href="Tony%20Waddington">Tony Waddington</a> was appointed as the club's manager in June 1960. He joined the club in 1952 as a coach, before being promoted to assistant manager in 1957. In his first season in charge, <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1960–61</a>, Stoke finished 18th in the Second Division. Crowds were still low; a match against <a href="Preston%20North%20End">Preston North End</a> attracted 8,409 in 1961. However, Waddington pulled off a significant coup by enticing Stanley Matthews—now 46 years old—back to the club, 14 years after he had left. A crowd of 35,974 witnessed Matthews' return to the club, only a fortnight after the poor crowd against Preston. The return of Matthews helped Stoke to rise to eighth position in <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1961–62</a>. Promotion was achieved in the next season, when Stoke finished as champions. In their first season back in the First Division, <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1963–64</a>, Waddington guided Stoke to a mid-table finish. Matthews remained influential, as he helped the club to the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a> <a href="1964%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">final in 1964</a>, although this ended in a 4–3 defeat to <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester</a> over <a href="two-legged%20match">two legs</a>.

Waddington relied upon experience; <a href="Dennis%20Viollet">Dennis Viollet</a>, <a href="Jackie%20Mudie">Jackie Mudie</a>, <a href="Roy%20Vernon">Roy Vernon</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Setters">Maurice Setters</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20McIlroy">Jimmy McIlroy</a> were players signed in the later stages of their careers. Matthews was awarded a <a href="knight">knight</a>hood for services to football in the 1965 New Year's Honours list. This was followed by his final, league appearance for the club against <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> in February 1965, shortly after his 50th birthday. It ended a career spanning 33 years, including 19 years' service to his home town club. <a href="Gordon%20Banks">Gordon Banks</a>, <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England's</a> <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966 World Cup</a> winning <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28football%29">goalkeeper</a>, joined Stoke from Leicester in 1967 for <a href="%C2%A3">£</a>52,000. Regarded as the best goalkeeper in the world, Banks proved to be a shrewd signing for Waddington as he helped the club maintain stability in the First Division. However, Banks was forced to quit top-level football in 1972, after losing an eye in a road accident.

The club won its first significant trophy on 4 March 1972, in the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> Final. Stoke beat favourites <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> <a href="1972%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2–1 in the final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> before a crowd of 97,852 spectators. Before this victory, Stoke had progressed through 11 games to reach the final. This included four games with <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> in the <a href="semi-final">semi-final</a>; the <a href="two-legged%20match">two-legged match</a> was <a href="Replay%20%28sports%29">played</a> twice. Stoke fared well in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>; the club progressed to the semi-final stage in both the <a href="1970-71%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1970–71</a> and <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1971–72</a> seasons. However, on both occasions Stoke lost to Arsenal in a <a href="Replay%20%28sports%29">replay</a>.

Waddington was presented with a dilemma as both <a href="George%20Eastham">George Eastham</a> and <a href="Peter%20Dobing">Peter Dobing</a> retired not long after the club's League Cup win. Waddington responded by paying £240,000 to Chelsea for the services of <a href="Alan%20Hudson">Alan Hudson</a> in early 1974. This was followed by Geoff Salmons' arrival from Sheffield United for £160,000, in the same year. Waddington later paid a world record fee for a goalkeeper, £325,000, to sign <a href="Peter%20Shilton">Peter Shilton</a> from Leicester City. The new personnel brought added impetus to Waddington's side, and Stoke were close to winning the League title in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1974–75</a>, but an end of season slump led to a fifth-place finish, four points off the champions, <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby</a>.

The 1970s also saw Stoke compete at European Level for the first time in its history. Stoke qualified for the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20UEFA%20Cup">1972–73</a> as a result of their League Cup triumph. In the first round, Stoke played <a href="1.%20FC%20Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a> of Germany: Stoke won the first leg 3–1 at the Victoria Ground, with a crowd of over 22,000. However, the club lost the second leg 4–0, therefore losing 5–3 on <a href="Two-legged%20match">aggregate</a>. Stoke qualified for the UEFA Cup two years later, due to their fifth-place finish in the First Division in the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1973–74</a> season. In the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20UEFA%20Cup">1974–75 competition</a>, Stoke were again knocked out at the first stage. Stoke drew both legs against Dutch side <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a>, 1–1 and 0–0 respectively, but went out due to the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>.

The Butler Stand roof was blown off in a storm in January 1976. The ground damage meant the club's next home game against <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> had to be played at <a href="Vale%20Park">Vale Park</a>, the home of local rivals Port Vale. The repair bill, in the region of £250,000, put the club in financial trouble, which was eased by the sale of <a href="Alan%20Hudson">Alan Hudson</a>, <a href="Mike%20Pejic">Mike Pejic</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Greenhoff">Jimmy Greenhoff</a> for a combined sum of £440,000. With the team depleted, relegation proved inevitable in the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1976–77</a> season. Waddington, after a spell of 17 years in charge, left the club after a 1–0 home defeat in March 1977.

<a href="George%20Eastham">George Eastham</a>, who had previously been Waddington's assistant, was appointed as manager in March 1977, but the club's slide into the Second Division in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1976–77 season</a> proved unstoppable. Eastham did not last long, leaving in January 1978 after only 10 months in charge. The club's misery was compounded by a defeat to <a href="Non-League%20football">non-league</a> <a href="Blyth%20Spartans%20A.F.C.">Blyth Spartans</a> in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> shortly afterwards. <a href="Alan%20Durban">Alan Durban</a>, arriving from <a href="Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.">Shrewsbury Town</a>, was selected as the club's new manager in February 1978. Durban achieved promotion to the First Division in his first full season, <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1978–79</a>, with a third-place finish. After consolidating the club's position in the First Division, Durban left for Sunderland in 1981.

Richie Barker, Durban's successor, was appointed manager in 1981. He signed <a href="Mickey%20Thomas%20%28footballer%29">Mickey Thomas</a> from <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton and Hove Albion</a> and <a href="Mark%20Chamberlain">Mark Chamberlain</a> from Port Vale, as he set about building a side for the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1982–83 season</a>. Thomas was signed for £200,000 and made over 60 appearances for the club, but was sold to Chelsea for £75,000 in 1984. <a href="Midfielder%23Winger">Winger</a> Chamberlain, a £135,00 signing, proved successful as he made eight appearances for England during his stay at Stoke. Barker's spell in charge was short-lived; he was sacked in his second season, <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1983–84</a>. The club's new manager, <a href="Bill%20Asprey">Bill Asprey</a>, decided to bring back veteran <a href="Alan%20Hudson">Alan Hudson</a>, and the decision paid off as Stoke improved during the second half of the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1983–84 season</a> and avoided relegation on the final day.

The <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">next season</a>, referred to as "The Holocaust Season" by fans, proved to be disastrous. Stoke finished the season with only 17 points and just three wins, which would be the lowest points total in the top flight of English football (under the "three points for a win" system) for 21 years until the record was broken by Sunderland in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06 season</a>. <a href="Mick%20Mills">Mick Mills</a> was appointed <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a> for the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1985–86 season</a>, following Asprey's departure in April 1985 due to ill health. His first task was to consolidate following the club's relegation in the previous season, which he achieved with a mid-table finish in the Second Division. The team reached fourth place in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1986–87</a>, his second season in charge, including a 7–2 win over <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a>, but the team's form tailed off towards the end of the season, culminating in an eighth-place finish. Mills was unable to sustain a challenge for promotion and was sacked in November 1989, following a poor start to the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1989–90 season</a> after spending £1m on players. His successor, <a href="Alan%20Ball%2C%20Jr.">Alan Ball</a>, became the club's fifth manager in 10 years. <a href="Peter%20Coates">Peter Coates</a> became the club's chairman in 1989, following numerous changes of chairmanship during the 1980s.

Ball struggled in his first season in charge, <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1989–90</a>, and his Stoke side were relegated to the third tier of English football after finishing bottom of the Second Division. The start of the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1990–91</a> season in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> marked the first time Stoke had played at this level in 63 years. Ball kept his job for the start of this campaign but departed in February 1991 in the midst of an indifferent season that saw Stoke finish in their lowest league position of 14th.

Ball's successor, <a href="Lou%20Macari">Lou Macari</a>, was appointed in May 1991, prior to the start of the <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1991–92 season</a>. The improvement was immediate, as Stoke narrowly missed out on promotion in his first season in charge, finishing fourth in the Third Division. He also clinched a cup for the club; the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> was won with a <a href="1992%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">1–0 victory</a> against <a href="Stockport%20County%20F.C.">Stockport County</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>; <a href="Mark%20Stein%20%28footballer%29">Mark Stein</a> scored the only goal of the game. The following season, <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1992–93</a>, promotion was achieved from the third tier, with Stoke finishing as league champions. Stein, a £100,000 purchase from <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a>, scored 26 goals during the season as Stoke amassed a total of 93 points. Macari left in October 1993 to take over as manager of Scottish side <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>, and Stein also departed in a £1.5m move to Chelsea.

<a href="Joe%20Jordan%20%28footballer%29">Joe Jordan's</a> tenure in charge was short; he left the club less than a year after joining. Following Jordan's departure, Stoke opted to reappoint Lou Macari only 12 months after he had left. Despite the optimism surrounding his return, only a mid-table finish was attained in the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1994–95 season</a>. The <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1995–96 season</a> started poorly, but the signing of striker <a href="Mike%20Sheron">Mike Sheron</a> turned around the club's campaign. Stoke eventually finished fourth but were defeated in the play-off semi-final by Leicester City. The following season, <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1996–97</a>, saw Mark Stein return from Chelsea on <a href="Loan%20%28football%29">loan</a>, partnering Sheron in attack. The season started well, with Stoke in fourth place at Christmas, but a poor second half of the season saw the club drop to an eventual 12th place. Sheron was sold in 1997 for a club record fee of £2.5m. Macari left the club at the end of the season, his last game in charge the final league game at the <a href="Victoria%20Ground">Victoria Ground</a> in a match against West Bromwich Albion.

The <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1997–98</a> season saw Stoke move to its new ground, the 28,000 all-seater <a href="Britannia%20Stadium">Britannia Stadium</a>, after 119 years at the Victoria Ground, the longest time spent at a ground by any team in Britain. <a href="Chic%20Bates">Chic Bates</a>, Macari's assistant, was appointed manager for the club's inaugural season in the new ground. Bates struggled as his side slipped from a play-off place towards the relegation zone, with the club's bad run culminating in a 7–0 home defeat to <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>. Bates was replaced by <a href="Chris%20Kamara">Chris Kamara</a> in January 1998. Kamara could not improve the club's fortunes, and he left in April. <a href="Alan%20Durban">Alan Durban</a>, Stoke's manager two decades earlier, took charge for the remainder of season. Durban was unable to keep the club up, with a 23rd-place finish consigning Stoke to relegation from Division One.

<a href="Brian%20Little%20%28footballer%29">Brian Little</a>, formerly manager of <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, took charge for the <a href="1998-99%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1998–99 season</a>, and Stoke began the season impressively, holding first place until December with six straight wins. The team's form tailed off in the latter stages of the season, leading to Little's departure at the end of the season. His successor, <a href="Gary%20Megson">Gary Megson</a>, was only in the job for four months. Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by <a href="Stoke%20Holding">Stoke Holding</a>, an <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>ic consortium that purchased a 66 percent share in Stoke City F.C. for <a href="%C2%A3">£</a>6.6m. The club's new owners appointed the club's first foreign manager, Icelander <a href="Gudjon%20Thordarson">Gudjon Thordarson</a>, in November 1999.

Stoke won the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1999–2000 season</a> with a <a href="2000%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">2–1 win over</a> <a href="Bristol%20City%20F.C.">Bristol City</a> in April 2000 before a crowd of 75,057 at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>. Disappointment followed a month later, as Stoke were defeated against <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a> in the <a href="Football%20League%20Play-Offs">play-off</a> semi-finals, consigning themselves to another year in Division Two. They reached the play-offs again in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2000–01 season</a> with a fifth-place finish, but this time <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> halted Stoke's progress at the semi-final stage. Thordarson achieved promotion at the third attempt in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2001–02</a>; another fifth-place finish ensured a play-off spot. <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> were defeated in the semi-final before a <a href="2002%20Football%20League%20Second%20Division%20play-off%20Final">2–0 win against</a> <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> secured promotion. Despite achieving the goal of promotion, Thordarson was sacked by <a href="Gunnar%20G%C3%ADslason%20%28businessman%29">Gunnar Gíslason</a>, only five days after the club won the play-off final. A campaign calling for Thordarson's reinstatement was organised by fans, but it proved unsuccessful.

<a href="Steve%20Cotterill">Steve Cotterill</a> was drafted in as Thordarson's replacement before the start of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2002–03 season</a>. Cotterill quit in October 2002, after only four months in charge, to take the role of <a href="Howard%20Wilkinson">Howard Wilkinson's</a> assistant at Sunderland. The club were close to unveiling <a href="George%20Burley">George Burley</a> as their new manager after Cotterill's departure; however, a last minute charge of heart led the former <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich</a> manager to decline the club's offer. The club acted swiftly and <a href="Tony%20Pulis">Tony Pulis</a> was appointed as Stoke's new manager shortly afterwards. Pulis steered Stoke clear of relegation with a 1–0 win over <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> on the final day of the season that kept the club in the First Division. The club's position in the league was consolidated in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2003–04</a>. Pulis was sacked at the end of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2004–05 season</a>, following a disagreement between himself and the club's owners. Dutch manager <a href="Johan%20Boskamp">Johan Boskamp</a> was named as Pulis' successor on 29 June 2005, only a day after Pulis was sacked. Boskamp broke the club's transfer record in signing <a href="Samb%C3%A9gou%20Bangoura">Sambegou Bangoura</a> for a fee in the region of £1m. Another significant addition was the signing of <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium international</a> <a href="Carl%20Hoefkens">Carl Hoefkens</a>, who subsequently won the Fans' Player of the Year Award for the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2005–06 season</a>. Despite his spending on new players, Boskamp's side was inconsistent and only a mid-table finish was achieved. The season was marred by a feud between Boskamp and the club's <a href="director%20of%20football">director of football</a>, <a href="John%20Rudge">John Rudge</a>, which escalated to the point where Boskamp threatened to quit. Boskamp left at the end of the 2005–06 season, amidst a takeover by former chairman <a href="Peter%20Coates">Peter Coates</a>.

On 23 May 2006, Coates completed his takeover of Stoke City, marking the end of <a href="Gunnar%20G%C3%ADslason%20%28businessman%29">Gunnar Gíslason</a>'s chairmanship of the club. Coates chose former manager <a href="Tony%20Pulis">Tony Pulis</a> as Boskamp's successor in June 2006. Pulis took Stoke close to a play-off place, however an eventual eighth-place finish was achieved in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2006–07 season</a>. In June 2007, chairman Peter Coates purchased the <a href="Britannia%20Stadium">Britannia Stadium</a> outright from the <a href="City%20Council">City Council</a> for a fee in the region of £6m.

Stoke won automatic promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> on the final day of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a>, finishing in 2nd place in the Championship. On 18 July 2008, the club broke their transfer record to purchase striker <a href="Dave%20Kitson">Dave Kitson</a> for £5.5 million from <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a>. A 3–1 defeat to <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> on the opening day of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2008–09</a> season saw Stoke written off by many media outlets as relegation certainties. The following weekend, the Britannia Stadium hosted its first ever top-flight game, against <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, with a home win courtesy of <a href="Mamady%20Sidibe">Mamady Sidibe</a>'s injury-time goal from a <a href="Rory%20Delap">Rory Delap</a> throw-in, giving Stoke City their first ever Premier League points. The club went on to record a 12th-place finish in their first season back in the Premier League. A much cited aspect of the team's style of play has been the utilisation of <a href="Rory%20Delap">Rory Delap</a>'s long throw to create goal-scoring opportunities. Pulis signed <a href="Robert%20Huth">Robert Huth</a> and <a href="Tuncay%20%C5%9Eanl%C4%B1">Tuncay Şanlı</a> from <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> for a combined fee in the region of £10 million, in a bid to establish the club in the Premier League prior to the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2009–10 season</a>. This feat was achieved comfortably as the club finished in 11th place, thereby securing a third season in the Premier League. Pulis bolstered his squad for <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2010–11 season</a> with the club record £8 million signing of <a href="Kenwyne%20Jones">Kenwyne Jones</a>.

A 3–0 win over <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2010–11 season</a> gave Stoke two new records: The largest away win in the Premier League and largest top division away win since 1982 and also the first time since the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1983–84 season</a> Stoke have won three top-flight matches in a row. Manager Pulis hailed the new records as ""A Fantastic Achievement"". For the second season running Stoke made it to the quarter final of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> after overcoming <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a>, <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> and <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a>. They met <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> in the quarters and won 2–1 thus earning a place in the <a href="FA%20Cup%20Semi-finals">FA Cup Semi-final</a> for only the fourth time in their history. It was also be their first trip to the <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">New Wembley Stadium</a> when they took on <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> for a place in the final. Stoke comfortably beat Bolton 5–0 clinching a first <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a> appearance in their 148-year history. However, they lost the <a href="2011%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final 1–0</a> to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. By reaching the final, Stoke qualified for the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2011–12 UEFA Europa League</a>. Despite a strong season, with an 8th-place finish in sight, defeat at home to <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> in the final game meant that Stoke finished 13th in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2010–11 season</a>.

On 28 July 2011, Stoke beat <a href="HNK%20Hajduk%20Split">Hadjuk Split</a> 2–0 over two legs in the third qualifying round of the <a href="Europa%20League">Europa League</a>. It was Stoke's first appearance in Europe in 37 years. Stoke would go on progress past <a href="FC%20Thun">FC Thun</a> in the Play-off round gaining entrance into the group stage where Stoke were handed a tough draw against <a href="Besiktas%20J.K.">Besiktas</a>, <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a> and <a href="Maccabi%20Tel%20Aviv%20F.C.">Maccabi Tel Aviv</a>. Stoke finished second in the group and were handed a glamour tie against Spanish giants <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> in the round of 32, following the draw manager Pulis stated that he is relishing the prospect of taking on one of Europe's top clubs. Stoke lost both legs 1–0 to end their European campaign. Pulis received criticism from some supporters after he fielded a weakened team in the second leg. Stoke ended the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2011–12 season</a> in 14th position in what was perceived to be a disappointing season. The <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2012–13</a> season saw Stoke make little progress, finishing in 13th position. Pulis subsequently left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.

He was replaced by another Welsh manager, <a href="Mark%20Hughes">Mark Hughes</a>. Hughes led Stoke to a ninth-place finish in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2013–14</a>, their highest position in the Premier League and best finish since <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">1974–75</a>. Stoke again finished in ninth position in <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2014–15</a>, which ended with a 6–1 victory against Liverpool. Despite breaking their transfer record twice (on <a href="Xherdan%20Shaqiri">Xherdan Shaqiri</a> and then <a href="Giannelli%20Imbula">Giannelli Imbula</a>), in <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2015–16</a>, Stoke did not make any progression and finished in ninth position for a third season running. Stoke declined in <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2016–17</a>, finishing in 13th position. The decline continued in <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Stoke%20City%20F.C.%20season">2017–18</a> under Mark Hughes and hes was sacked in January 2018 with the club in the relegation zone. The board chose <a href="Paul%20Lambert">Paul Lambert</a> to try and keep Stoke up but he managed just two wins in 15, ending Stoke's ten year spell in the Premier League.

Cryptoprocta spelea

Cryptoprocta spelea, also known as the giant fossa, is an <a href="extinction">extinct</a> species of carnivore from <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> in the family <a href="Eupleridae">Eupleridae</a>, which is most closely related to the <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a>s and includes all Malagasy carnivorans. It was first described in 1902, and in 1935 was recognized as a separate species from its closest relative, the living <a href="fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a> ("Cryptoprocta ferox"). "C. spelea" is larger than the fossa, but otherwise similar. The two have not always been accepted as distinct species. When and how the larger form became extinct is unknown; there is some anecdotal evidence, including reports of very large fossas, that there is more than one surviving species.

The species is known from <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> bones found in a variety of caves in northern, western, southern, and central Madagascar. In some sites, it occurs with remains of "C. ferox", but there is no evidence that the two lived in the same places at the same time. Living species of comparably sized, related carnivores in other regions manage to coexist, suggesting that the same may have happened with both "C. spelea" and "C. ferox". "C. spelea" would have been able to prey on larger animals than its smaller relative could have, including the recently extinct <a href="Subfossil%20lemur">giant lemurs</a>.

In 1902, <a href="Guillaume%20Grandidier">Guillaume Grandidier</a> described <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> carnivoran remains from two caves on Madagascar as a larger "variety" of the living <a href="fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a> ("Cryptoprocta ferox"), "C. ferox" var. "spelea". G. Petit, writing in 1935, considered "spelea" to represent a distinct species. <a href="Charles%20Lamberton">Charles Lamberton</a> reviewed subfossil and living "Cryptoprocta" in 1939 and agreed with Petit in recognizing two species, naming this species from a specimen found at <a href="Ankazoabo%20Cave">Ankazoabo Cave</a> near <a href="Itampolo">Itampolo</a>. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "spelea" means "cave" and was given because of the location of its discovery. However, Lamberton apparently had at most three skeletons of the living fossa, not nearly enough to capture the range of variation in that species, and some later authors did not separate "C. spelea" and "C. ferox" as species. <a href="Steven%20Goodman">Steven Goodman</a> and colleagues, using larger samples, compiled another set of "Cryptoprocta" measurements that was published in a 2004 article. They found that some subfossil "Cryptoprocta" fell outside the range of variation of living "C. ferox", and identified those as representing "C. spelea". Grandidier had not designated a <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> for the species, and to maintain "C. spelea" as the name for the larger form of the fossa, Goodman and colleagues designated a specimen to serve as the type specimen (specifically, a <a href="neotype">neotype</a>).

Lamberton recognized a third species, "Cryptoprocta antamba", on the basis of a <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) with abnormally broad spacing between the <a href="condyloid%20process">condyloid process</a>es at the back. He also referred two <a href="femur">femora</a> (upper leg bones) and a <a href="tibia">tibia</a> (lower leg bone) intermediate in size between "C. spelea" and "C. ferox" to this species. The specific name refers to the "antamba", an animal allegedly from southern Madagascar described by <a href="%C3%89tienne%20de%20Flacourt">Étienne de Flacourt</a> in 1658 as a large, rare, leopard-like carnivore that eats men and calves and lives in remote mountainous areas; it may have been the giant fossa. Goodman and colleagues could not locate Lamberton's material of "Cryptoprocta antamba", but suggested that it was based on an abnormal "C. spelea". Together, the fossa and "C. spelea" form the genus "Cryptoprocta" within the family <a href="Eupleridae">Eupleridae</a>, which also includes the other Malagasy <a href="carnivora">carnivora</a>ns—the <a href="falanouc">falanouc</a>, the <a href="fanaloka">fanaloka</a>s, and the <a href="Galidiinae">Galidiinae</a>. <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> studies suggest that the Eupleridae form a single natural (<a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a>) group and are most closely related to the <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a>s of Eurasia and mainland Africa.

Although some <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphological</a> differences between the two fossa species have been described, these may be <a href="allometric">allometric</a> (growth-related), and in their 1986 "<a href="Mammalian%20Species">Mammalian Species</a>" account of the fossa, Michael Köhncke and Klaus Leonhardt wrote that the two were morphologically identical. However, remains of "C. spelea" are larger than any living "C. ferox". Goodman and colleagues found that skull measurements in specimens they identified as "C. spelea" were 1.07 to 1.32 times as large as in adult "C. ferox", and <a href="postcrania">postcrania</a>l measurements were 1.19 to 1.37 times as large. The only specimen of "C. spelea" in which <a href="condylobasal%20length">condylobasal length</a> (a measure of total skull length) could be ascertained measured 153.4 mm (6.04 in), compared to a range of 114.5 to 133.3 mm (4.51 to 5.25 in) in adult "C. ferox". <a href="Humerus">Humerus</a> (upper arm bone) length in twelve "C. spelea" is 122.7 to 146.8 mm (4.83 to 5.78 in), averaging 137.9 mm (5.43 in), compared to 108.5 to 127.5 mm (4.27 to 5.02 in), averaging 116.1 mm (4.57 in), in the extant fossa. Body mass estimates for "C. spelea" range from 17 kg (37 lb) to 20 kg (44 lb), and it was among the largest carnivores of the island. By comparison, adult "C. ferox" range from 5 kg (11 lb) to 10 kg (22 lb).

"Cryptoprocta spelea" is the only extinct <a href="carnivora">carnivora</a>n mammal known from Madagascar; recently extinct Madagascan animals also include at least 17 species of <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s, most of which are larger than the living forms, as well as <a href="elephant%20bird">elephant bird</a>s and <a href="Malagasy%20hippopotamus">Malagasy hippopotamus</a>es, among others. Subfossil remains of the giant fossa have been found in <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> cave sites from the northern end of Madagascar along the west coast to the far south, and in the central highlands. Some sites have yielded both "C. spelea" and smaller remains referable to the living species, "C. ferox"; however, lack of robust <a href="stratigraphy">stratigraphic</a> knowledge and no available <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a> on subfossil "Cryptoprocta" bones makes it uncertain whether the two species lived in the same region at the same time. The size ratio between the two species is within the range of ratios seen between similar-sized living <a href="Felidae">cats</a> and <a href="Herpestidae">mongooses</a> found in the same areas, suggesting that the two species may have been able to occur together.

With its large size and massive jaws and teeth, "C. spelea" was a formidable, "puma-like" predator, and in addition to smaller <a href="lemurid">lemurid</a>s, it may have eaten some of the big, now extinct <a href="subfossil%20lemur">subfossil lemur</a>s that would have been too large for "C. ferox". No subfossil evidence has been found to definitively show that lemurs were its prey; this assumption is based on the diet of the smaller, extant species of fossa. Other possible prey include <a href="tenrec">tenrec</a>s, smaller <a href="euplerid">euplerid</a>s, and even young <a href="Malagasy%20hippopotamus">Malagasy hippopotamus</a>es. Its extinction may have changed predation dynamics on Madagascar. While not known, it is possible that "C. spelea" went extinct before 1400.

The <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> currently lists "C. spelea" as an extinct species; why and when it became extinct remains unknown. However, local people on Madagascar often recognize two forms of fossa, a larger "fosa mainty" (or "black "Cryptoprocta"") and a smaller "fosa mena" (or "reddish "Cryptoprocta""). There are also some anecdotal records of very large living fossas, such as a 2 m (7 ft), 30 kg (70 lb) fossa at <a href="Morondava">Morondava</a>. Goodman and colleagues suggested that further research may demonstrate that there is more than one species of fossa yet alive.

Victoria Cross for Australia

The Victoria Cross for Australia is the highest award in the <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20Australia">Australian Honours System</a>, superseding the British <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for issue to Australians. The Victoria Cross for Australia is the "decoration for according recognition to persons who in the presence of the enemy, perform acts of the most conspicuous gallantry, or daring or pre-eminent acts of valour or self-sacrifice or display extreme devotion to duty."

The Victoria Cross for Australia was created by <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> signed by <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Australia">Queen of Australia</a>, on 15 January 1991. It is listed equal first with the British Victoria Cross on the <a href="Australian%20Honours%20Order%20of%20Precedence">Australian Order of Wear</a> with precedence in Australia over all orders, decorations and medals. The decoration may be awarded to members of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a> and to other persons determined by the <a href="Australian%20Minister%20for%20Defence">Australian Minister for Defence</a>. A person to whom the Victoria Cross for Australia has been awarded is entitled to the post nominals VC placed after the person's name.

The <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General of Australia</a> awards the Victoria Cross for Australia, with the approval of the Sovereign, on the recommendation of the Minister for Defence. The first medal was awarded on 16 January 2009 to <a href="Trooper%20%28rank%29">Trooper</a> <a href="Mark%20Donaldson">Mark Donaldson</a>, for the rescue of a coalition forces interpreter from heavy fire in Oruzgan Province in <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">Afghanistan</a>. Donaldson's award came almost 40 years after <a href="Warrant%20Officer">Warrant Officer</a> <a href="Keith%20Payne">Keith Payne</a> became the last Australian to be awarded the (original) Victoria Cross for gallantry on 24 May 1969 during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. Unlike the original Victoria Cross where the announcement of the award is followed some time later by the presentation of the award, the announcement and presentation of all awards of the VC for Australia have occurred on the same occasion with the presentation being made by the Governor-General in the presence of the Prime Minister. Both VC for Australia and original Victoria Cross recipients are entitled to the Victoria Cross allowance under the "Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986".

On 29 January 1856, <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> signed the Royal Warrant that officially instituted the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>. The Warrant was backdated to 1854 to recognise acts of valour committed during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. It was originally intended that the Victoria Crosses would be cast from the <a href="bronze">bronze</a> <a href="wikt%3Acascabel">cascabels</a> of two <a href="cannon">cannon</a> that were captured from the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russians</a> at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281854%E2%80%931855%29">Siege of Sevastopol</a>. However, historian John Glanfield has proven, through the use of X-rays of older Victoria Crosses, that the metal used for the Victoria Crosses is in fact from antique Chinese guns, and not of Russian origin.

The barrels of the cannon used to cast the medals are stationed outside the Officers' Mess, at the <a href="Royal%20Artillery%20Barracks">Royal Artillery Barracks</a> at <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>. The remaining portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 10 kilograms (358 oz), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment, <a href="Royal%20Logistic%20Corps">Royal Logistic Corps</a> at <a href="MoD%20Donnington">MoD Donnington</a>, and can be removed only under armed guard. It is estimated that 80 to 85 more Victoria Crosses could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, <a href="Hancocks">Hancocks</a> of London, established in 1849, has been responsible for the production of every medal since its inception. Both the Australian and New Zealand Victoria Crosses are made from the same gunmetal as the originals.

The original medal was awarded to <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">96 Australians</a>; 91 of these were received while serving as members of Australian forces; five were received by former members of the Australian forces who were serving with South African or British forces. Sixty-four awards were for action in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, nine of them for action during the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>. Twenty medals were awarded for action in the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, and the other medals were for action in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a> and in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. The last recipient was <a href="Warrant%20Officer">Warrant Officer</a> <a href="Keith%20Payne">Keith Payne</a>, for gallantry on 24 May 1969 during the Vietnam War. Payne was awarded the medal for instigating a rescue of more than 40 men.

In the past 70 years several <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> countries have introduced their own honours systems, completely separate from the <a href="British%20Honours%20System">British Honours System</a>. Australia, Canada and New Zealand have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> with their own awards. Most <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>s still recognise some form of the Victoria Cross as their highest decoration for valour.

With the issuing of <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> by the Queen of Australia on 15 January 1991, Australia became the first Commonwealth realm to institute a separate Victoria Cross award in its own honours system. Although it is a separate award, the Victoria Cross for Australia's appearance is identical to its British counterpart. Canada followed suit when in 1993, Queen Elizabeth II as <a href="Queen%20of%20Canada">Queen of Canada</a> signed Letters Patent creating the <a href="Canadian%20Victoria%20Cross">Canadian Victoria Cross</a>. The Canadian version has a different inscription, as well as being created from a different unspecified metal. The legend has been changed from to the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> . Although one Canadian VC has been cast, none has been awarded. In 1999, New Zealand created the <a href="Victoria%20Cross%20for%20New%20Zealand">Victoria Cross for New Zealand</a>, identical to the Australian and British Victoria Crosses, and this has been awarded once, on 2 July 2007 to Corporal <a href="Willie%20Apiata">Willie Apiata</a>.

The Victoria Cross for Australia is identical to the original design. It is a "<a href="cross%20patt%C3%A9e">cross pattée</a> 41 millimetres high, 36 millimetres wide. The arms of the Cross have raised edges. The obverse bears a Crowned Lion standing on the Royal Crown with the words 'FOR VALOUR' inscribed on a semi-circular scroll below the Crown. The reverse bears raised edges on the arms of the cross and the date of the act for which the Cross is awarded is engraved within the circle in the centre. The inscription was originally to have been , until it was changed on the recommendation of Queen Victoria, who thought some might erroneously consider that only the recipients of the Victoria Cross were brave in battle. The decoration, suspension bar, and link weigh about 27 grams (0.87 <a href="troy%20ounce">troy ounce</a>s).

The cross is suspended by a ring from a <a href="serif">serif</a>fed "V" to a bar ornamented with laurel leaves, through which the ribbon passes. The reverse of the suspension bar is engraved with the recipient's name, rank, number and unit. On the reverse of the medal is a circular panel, on which the date of the act for which it was awarded is engraved in the centre. The ribbon is crimson, and is 38 millimetres (1.5 inches) wide. Although the warrants state the colour as red, it is defined by most commentators as "crimson" or "wine-red".

The Victoria Cross for Australia is awarded for 

Awards are granted by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a> with the approval of the <a href="Monarchy%20in%20Australia">Sovereign</a>. The warrant for the Victoria Cross for Australia differs markedly from the Imperial warrant. The new warrant does not specify any particular process for recommendations, though it is expected that any recommendation will pass through the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force%23Current%20structure">military hierarchy</a> to the <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>. The new warrant also allows for "other persons determined by the Minister [for Defence] for the purposes of this regulation." Author <a href="Robert%20Macklin">Robert Macklin</a> has speculated that this has opened up the field of eligibility to policemen and women or civilians during a terrorist act. He goes on to say that by "separating the VC from its traditional roots the Hawke government can be accused, with some justice, of devaluing the honour ..." Subsequent awards of the Victoria Cross for Australia to the same individual shall be made in the form of a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to the Cross. Where a person has been awarded a second or three or more awards, the post nominals "VC and Bar" or "VC and Bars" may be used.

The Victoria Cross for Australia is the highest award in the <a href="Australian%20Honours%20Order%20of%20Precedence">Australian Honours Order of Precedence</a>. As such, it takes precedence over all other <a href="Commonwealth%20Realms%20orders%20and%20decorations%23Australia">Australian orders and decorations</a>, except the Imperial <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, with which it shares equal precedence. This postnominal is valid only for the recipient and is not transferred to the recipient's heirs. "Tradition holds that even the most senior officer will salute a Victoria Cross recipient as a mark of the utmost respect for their act of valour." Whilst it has been a tradition for many years to salute a Victoria Cross recipient the Australian Army Ceremonial Manual, Volume 1, Annex B to Chapter 13 states "Victoria Cross winners, unless they are serving commissioned officers in the armed forces, are not saluted". <a href="Air%20Chief%20Marshal%20%28Australia%29">Air Chief Marshal</a> <a href="Angus%20Houston">Angus Houston</a> saluted Trooper <a href="Mark%20Donaldson">Mark Donaldson</a> after he received his VC. Under Section 103, Subsection (4), of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Australian Government pays a Victoria Cross Allowance to any service person awarded the medal. The act set this amount at <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>3,230 per year. Since 20 September 2005, this amount has been indexed annually in line with Australian Consumer Price Index increases. This amount is in addition to any amount that the veteran may be awarded under the general decoration allowance of $2.10 per fortnight.

The various forms of the Victoria Cross are inherently valuable, as was highlighted on 24 July 2006, when at the auctionhouse <a href="Bonhams">Bonhams</a> in Sydney, the VC which had been awarded to <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> soldier Captain <a href="Alfred%20John%20Shout">Alfred Shout</a>, fetched a world-record hammer price of $1 million. Shout had been awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously in 1915 for hand-to-hand combat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lone%20Pine">Lone Pine</a> trenches in <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. The buyer, <a href="Kerry%20Stokes">Kerry Stokes</a>, has lent it to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> for display with the eight other Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians at Gallipoli. The Australian War Memorial in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> currently holds 66 Victoria Crosses, 63 awarded to Australians—including Mark Donaldson's Victoria Cross for Australia on loan—and three to British soldiers; this formed the largest publicly displayed collection in the world, until the opening of the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Museum">Imperial War Museum</a> (IWM) in <a href="London">London</a> during November 2010, which displays the 168 VCs owned by <a href="Michael%20Ashcroft%2C%20Baron%20Ashcroft">Lord Ashcroft</a> and 48 more held by the IWM.

The first Victoria Cross for Australia was awarded to <a href="Trooper%20%28rank%29">Trooper</a> <a href="Mark%20Donaldson">Mark Donaldson</a> of the <a href="Special%20Air%20Service%20Regiment">Special Air Service Regiment</a> by Governor-General <a href="Quentin%20Bryce">Quentin Bryce</a> at <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Canberra">Government House, Canberra</a> on 16 January 2009. On 2 September 2008, Donaldson rescued an interpreter under heavy enemy fire in <a href="Oruzgan%20province">Oruzgan province</a> during <a href="Operation%20Slipper">Operation Slipper</a>, the Australian contribution to the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a>.

<a href="Corporal">Corporal</a> <a href="Ben%20Roberts-Smith">Ben Roberts-Smith</a> <a href="Medal%20for%20Gallantry">MG</a> of the Special Air Service Regiment was awarded the second Victoria Cross for Australia on 23 January 2011. Corporal Roberts-Smith was awarded the medal for single-handedly charging and destroying two <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> positions during the <a href="Shah%20Wali%20Kot%20Offensive">Shah Wali Kot Offensive</a> in Afghanistan on 11 June 2010. This act has been described as similar to that of <a href="Edward%20Kenna">Edward Kenna</a> VC. Corporal Roberts-Smith had previously been awarded a <a href="Medal%20for%20Gallantry">Medal for Gallantry</a> in 2006, and upon receiving the VC became the most highly decorated serving member of the Australian Defence Force.

Corporal <a href="Daniel%20Keighran">Daniel Keighran</a> of the <a href="6th%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a> was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia on 1 November 2012 for actions in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Derapet">Battle of Derapet</a> (<a href="Oruzgan%20province">Oruzgan province</a>, Afghanistan) in August 2010. Corporal Keighran deliberately exposed himself to enemy fire, drawing the fire away from an injured colleague and those who were attending to him. He is the third recipient, and the first non-Special Forces recipient, of the award.

On 13 February 2014, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Tony%20Abbott">Tony Abbott</a> announced that Corporal <a href="Cameron%20Baird">Cameron Baird</a> of the <a href="2nd%20Commando%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">2nd Commando Regiment</a> would be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. Corporal Baird had been awarded the <a href="Medal%20for%20Gallantry">Medal for Gallantry</a> in 2007 and was killed in Afghanistan in 2013.

On 3 April 2001, Senator <a href="Chris%20Schacht">Chris Schacht</a>, then a member of the <a href="Australian%20Senate">Australian Senate</a>, gave notice that on the next day of sitting he would introduce the "Award of Victoria Cross for Australia Bill 2001" to award the Victoria Cross for Australia to certain persons. The next sitting day, 4 April 2001, Senator Schacht introduced the bill for three members of the Australian forces to be awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia. The bill was read a first time and Senator Schacht gave his Second Reading Speech in which he said it could be argued that an Act conferring a Victoria Cross for Australia may be beyond the legislative power of the Parliament but he believed that the "naval and military defence of the Commonwealth" power under section 51(vi) of the Constitution gave the Parliament authority to legislate with respect to honours and awards. In accordance with normal procedure the debate was then adjourned. On 1 June 2001, <a href="Sid%20Sidebottom">Sid Sidebottom</a>, the <a href="Division%20of%20Braddon">Member for Braddon</a> introduced the "Defence Act Amendment (Victoria Cross) Bill 2001". The Bill was similar to the Senate bill and Sidebottom also believed that the Parliament had power under section 51(vi) of the Constitution. Neither bill was again debated before the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202001">2001 Australian federal election</a>. Both Senator Schacht and Mr Sidebottom were members of the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a>, then in opposition and the issue was included by the then opposition leader <a href="Kim%20Beazley">Kim Beazley</a> in his campaign in the following General Election. The awards were intended "to raise the profile and recognition of three ordinary Australians, who displayed outstanding bravery."

The awards were to be made posthumously to <a href="John%20Simpson%20Kirkpatrick">John Simpson Kirkpatrick</a> ("Simpson"), <a href="Albert%20Cleary">Albert Cleary</a> and <a href="Teddy%20Sheean">Teddy Sheean</a> for their actions in the First and Second World Wars. Simpson's story has become an Australian legend. He was a stretcher bearer with the <a href="3rd%20Field%20Ambulance%20%28Australia%29">3rd Australian Field Ambulance</a>, <a href="Australian%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Australian Army Medical Corps</a> at <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a> during the First World War. He landed at <a href="Anzac%20Cove">Anzac Cove</a> on 25 April 1915 and, on that first night, took a donkey and began carrying wounded from the battle line to the beach for evacuation. He continued this work for three and a half weeks, often under fire, until he was killed. However, in 1919, decreed that no more operational awards would be made for the recently concluded war.

In 1965, a campaign to award the Victoria Cross to Simpson resulted in his image with a donkey appearing on the obverse of the <a href="Anzac%20Commemorative%20Medallion">Anzac Commemorative Medallion</a> that was announced in 1966 and first issued in 1967. Following the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">2007 Australian federal election</a> the Labor party came to power and there was speculation that the 2001 bills may be reintroduced. Historians such as Anthony Staunton, writing in the "Australian Journal of Military History", have opined that the Victoria Cross for Australia should not be awarded retrospectively. It was announced on 13 April 2011 that 13 cases of valour would be examined posthumously by the Australian government's Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal. The Tribunal first debated "the eligibility of the 13 to receive the Victoria Cross, the Victoria Cross for Australia or other forms of recognition," before moving on to discuss the individual cases. The recommendations of the inquiry were ultimately submitted to government on 6 February 2013, advocating no awards be made.

Dungeons &amp; Dragons (album)

Dungeons & Dragons is a <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by the American musical group <a href="Midnight%20Syndicate">Midnight Syndicate</a>, released August 12, 2003, by Entity Productions. The album is designed as a soundtrack to the "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>" <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> and was produced by Midnight Syndicate at the request of <a href="Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a>, the company that owns the rights to the "Dungeons & Dragons" franchise. Midnight Syndicate was approached by game designers at a <a href="gaming%20convention">gaming convention</a> where they had set up stall, and they agreed to produce the album.

After an initial meeting with Wizards of the Coast, the two members of Midnight Syndicate—Edward Douglas and Gavin Goszka—were left to write and produce the album themselves. They went their separate ways and produced tracks independently of one another, but came back together to arrange the album and master the tracks. The album was a change in style for Midnight Syndicate, because most of it had a <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> feel, whereas their earlier works had been almost entirely <a href="Gothic%20horror">horror</a>-based. Artwork within the album booklet came from "Dungeons & Dragons" sourcebooks, including works from prominent game designers such as <a href="Skip%20Williams">Skip Williams</a>. The album was well received by Wizards of the Coast, with positive reviews from music critics and the gaming community. It is reputedly the only official "Dungeons & Dragons" soundtrack.

According to Bob Ignizio of Utter Trash, an <a href="ezine">ezine</a> featuring "music, movies and more", Midnight Syndicate's older albums had already been used as background music to role-playing sessions for many years. Wizards of the Coast described the band's music as "the perfect accompaniment to role-playing game sessions". Support for Midnight Syndicate's music as a role-playing aid grew so much that the band decided to set up stalls at <a href="gaming%20convention">gaming convention</a>s. At their first convention, Midnight Syndicate was approached by Wizards of the Coast, which subsequently asked if they would be interested in recording an official soundtrack, to which they agreed.

Before the band started writing or recording music they sat down with the "Dungeons & Dragons" designers, who informed them of several elements that were essential on the album. According to <a href="Ed%20Stark">Ed Stark</a>, the special project manager of Wizards of the Coast, this consisted of "a chase scene and a fight scene and things like that". This was new to the band who had never written music to fit someone else's ideas before. Stark said, however, that "they really got that. We were very impressed, because we're in sort of a niche industry, and we're not always used to people getting exactly what we need right away". After this, the band was mostly left to deal with the music themselves. The designers were already familiar with Midnight Syndicate's music and knew what to expect from the album. As inspiration for earlier albums had sometimes come from "Dungeons & Dragons" gaming sessions, Douglas said that writing the album came very naturally.

After the initial meeting with game designers, the album was written in the same way Midnight Syndicate conventionally write. First, Douglas and Goszka agreed on the setting they were trying to create with the album and then filled in details about the setting. Once this was done, they worked on music separately, in their own different studios. They remained in contact throughout the writing process to ensure that their work was cohesive and appropriate for the album. Once writing was complete, they worked together on arranging, mastering and mixing the tracks.

Douglas said that, for him, instrument choice came naturally and that "sounds and sometimes even melodies fall in line themselves". The band had a wide number of instruments at their disposal, as all the music is produced on <a href="synthesizers">synthesizers</a>. To ensure Douglas stayed true to creating the musical landscape he intended, his studio was covered with "Dungeons & Dragons" artwork and module covers throughout recording.

<a href="Joseph%20Vargo">Joseph Vargo</a>, the executive producer on Midnight Syndicate's albums "<a href="Born%20of%20the%20Night">Born of the Night</a>" and "<a href="Realm%20of%20Shadows">Realm of Shadows</a>", has said that he was the one who initiated the first contact between Wizards of the Coast and the band. Vargo claims that, in 1999, he sent a copy of "Born of the Night" to "Dungeons & Dragons" game designer <a href="Jason%20Carl">Jason Carl</a>, at the time employed by <a href="TSR%20%28company%29">TSR</a>, who described the album as "terrific gaming music". Vargo also says that he sent a copy of "<a href="Realm%20of%20Shadows">Realm of Shadows</a>" to Carl a year later, and this communication helped forge the link between the band and "Dungeons & Dragons" game designers.

Wizards of the Coast claimed that the album was the first official "Dungeons & Dragons" <a href="soundtrack">soundtrack</a>, and this was repeated by other groups, including Metropolis Mail Order, GamingReport.com, and Skirmisher Game Store. It was not, however, the first official "Dungeons & Dragons" music. Years earlier, another album, "First Quest: The Music", was released by Filmtrax and licensed by <a href="TSR%2C%20Inc.">TSR</a>, then-owners of "Dungeons & Dragons", for "<a href="Editions%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%23Advanced%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Advanced Dungeons & Dragons</a>". The album was released both as a <a href="Compact%20Cassette">cassette</a> and a <a href="Gramophone%20record">record</a> and came with a pre-printed <a href="Adventure%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">module</a>. Both formats proved unpopular and are difficult to find today. The music on "First Quest" was keyed specifically to the module that came with it, rather than as a soundtrack to the game in general.

According to Mario Mesquita Borges of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, Midnight Syndicate typically create "darkly blended compositions", described both as "gloomy" and "brooding". Leonard Pickel of "Haunted Attraction Magazine" stated that "each year, the band's music becomes more a part of America's Halloween culture", and stated that the band had "literally formed their own musical genre". For Douglas, however, "Dungeons & Dragons" was a different style of music from other albums and soundtracks that the band had produced. Originally, he had described Midnight Syndicate's music as "Gothic Nightmare Soundtracks", but claimed that "Dungeons & Dragons" had a more <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> feel than previous releases, which focused more on <a href="Gothic%20horror">horror</a>, meaning that he now describes the band's music as "Gothic Fantasy Nightmare Soundtracks". Chris Harvey of "Movement Magazine"—a magazine supporting "underground" music and arts—described the album as being <a href="symphonic">symphonic</a>, which he claimed added to the feel of the album. Sounds were also sampled, including the sounds of battle on "Final Confrontation", and spoken words in "Craft of the Wizard".

Peter-Jan Van Damme, the owner of the alternative music ezine Darker than the Bat, described "Dungeons & Dragons" as going more in the direction of <a href="Contemporary%20classical%20music">contemporary classical</a> <a href="composers">composers</a> such as <a href="Trevor%20Jones%20%28composer%29">Trevor Jones</a>, while still retaining the horror sound typical of Midnight Syndicate. The album has been categorized into a range of genres by reviewers, including <a href="Neoclassical%20%28Dark%20Wave%29">neoclassical</a>, gothic <a href="Ambient%20music">ambient</a>, <a href="Ethereal%20Wave">ethereal</a>, and <a href="gothic%20rock">gothic rock</a>.

Wizards of the Coast were happy with the resulting album, with Anthony Valterra, the company's RPG category manager, saying that Midnight Syndicate "have succeeded at capturing the magic of "D&D" through music". Numerous critics picked up on the idea that new subject matter had resulted in a new feel for the music, with reviewers claiming that the fantasy influence had given the album a different sound to Midnight Syndicate's gothic horror soundtracks. An unnamed writer for the now-defunct Living Dead Girls <a href="ezine">ezine</a> said that "Dungeons & Dragons" "brings a wider range of songs than Midnight Syndicate produces for their Gothic horror soundtracks", meaning that the album "displays for the first time the diversity and musical craft [of which] Midnight Syndicate is capable". GamingReport.com claimed that the album "furthered the band's establishment as the leading producer/supplier of music to the hobby game industry". "Dungeons & Dragons" became the best-selling role-playing game soundtrack ever in its first month of release, and Leonard Pickel of "Haunted Attraction Magazine" claimed that the album helped spread the band's popularity to Europe where "<a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> and Haunted Attractions are just beginning to take hold".

The album was criticized by Marc Shayed, of the hobby gaming news site GamingReport.com, for focusing too much on combat and ambiance. He explained that there was only one track that felt triumphant and no tracks suitable for traveling or character "down time", which are standards in fantasy gaming. Despite these perceived gaps, he did call it the "ultimate" gaming soundtrack. The album was further criticized by Gene Vogal of the National Gamers Guild who said that it lacked a lot of the "oomph" that "<a href="Vampyre%20%28album%29">Vampyre</a>" had, and thought Wizards of the Coast may have been to blame for it. He did think that the album's being composed explicitly for "D&D" made it superior to music not specifically composed for games (e.g., film soundtracks) as a gaming aid. He criticized the soundtrack for being less original than "Vampyre", and sounding much like <a href="Music%20of%20The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20film%20series">"The Lord of the Rings" soundtracks</a>.

The album was written and produced by Edward Douglas and Gavin Goszka, the only two members of Midnight Syndicate. The album's graphical design was executed by Mark Rakocy and Jeff Visgaitis, with "additional design" credited to "Stan!" The album heralded a change in production for Midnight Syndicate, as it was the first album for which the band hired a professional writer for descriptions in the album booklet and the blurb. Before this point, the descriptions had been written by Douglas or by Vargo, who had also been responsible for artwork in some earlier albums. Artwork for the album was taken from "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>" role-playing sourcebooks. Douglas said that he was "a huge fan of "Dungeons & Dragons" artwork, so having free on that material was fun". This artwork was praised by Gene Vogal, who described it as "one plus to the possible <a href="Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a> interference" and said that the "CD jacket was done very nicely and has some cool artwork throughout". The album contains artwork by the game designers <a href="Todd%20Lockwood">Todd Lockwood</a> and <a href="Skip%20Williams">Skip Williams</a>, as well as from the artists <a href="Scott%20Fischer%20%28artist%29">Scott Fischer</a>, <a href="Brian%20Snoddy">Brian Snoddy</a>, <a href="Lars%20Grant-West">Lars Grant-West</a>, <a href="Wayne%20Reynolds">Wayne Reynolds</a>, <a href="Mark%20Tedin">Mark Tedin</a>, and <a href="Sam%20Wood%20%28artist%29">Sam Wood</a>.

There is a final 36-second bonus track, which sometimes receives no title, and sometimes is named "BOTCH!" The Midnight Syndicate website does not mention the track at all. It is a joke track in which a hapless "D&D" player summons something from the game into the real world. Chris Harvey of "Movement Magazine" found the dice-rolling sound effects "hilarious".

<doc id="12149763" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12149763" title="Ordinances of 1311">
Ordinances of 1311

The Ordinances of 1311 were a series of regulations imposed upon King <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward II</a> by the <a href="peerage">peerage</a> and clergy of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a> to restrict the power of the king. The twenty-one signatories of the Ordinances are referred to as the Lords Ordainers, or simply the Ordainers. English setbacks in the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Scottish war</a>, combined with perceived extortionate royal fiscal policies, set the background for the writing of the Ordinances in which the administrative prerogatives of the king were largely appropriated by a baronial council. The Ordinances reflect the <a href="Provisions%20of%20Oxford">Provisions of Oxford</a> and the <a href="Provisions%20of%20Westminster">Provisions of Westminster</a> from the late 1250s, but unlike the Provisions, the Ordinances featured a new concern with fiscal reform, specifically redirecting revenues from the king's <a href="Royal%20Household">household</a> to the <a href="exchequer">exchequer</a>.

Just as instrumental to their conception were other issues, particularly discontent with the king's <a href="favourite">favourite</a>, <a href="Piers%20Gaveston%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cornwall">Piers Gaveston</a>, whom the barons subsequently banished from the realm. Edward II accepted the Ordinances only under coercion, and a long struggle for their repeal ensued that did not end until <a href="Thomas%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Thomas of Lancaster</a>—the leader of the Ordainers—was executed in 1322.

When Edward II succeeded his father <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I</a> on 7 July 1307, the attitude of his subjects was generally one of goodwill towards their new king. However, discontent was brewing beneath the surface. Some of this was due to existing problems left behind by the late king, while much was due to the new king's inadequacies. The problems were threefold. First there was discontent with the royal policy for financing wars. To finance the war in Scotland, Edward I had increasingly resorted to so-called prises – or <a href="purveyance">purveyance</a> – to provision the troops with victuals. Though a perfectly legitimate method of raising money, the peers felt that the purveyance had become far too burdensome and compensation was in many cases inadequate or missing entirely. In addition, they did not like the fact that Edward II took prises for his household without continuing the war effort against <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, causing the second problem. While Edward I had spent the last decade of his reign relentlessly campaigning against the Scots, his son abandoned the war almost entirely. In this situation, the Scottish king <a href="Robert%20I%20of%20Scotland">Robert Bruce</a> soon took the opportunity to regain what had been lost. This not only exposed the north of England to Scottish attacks, but also jeopardized the possessions of the English baronage in Scotland.

The third and most serious problem concerned the king's favourite, <a href="Piers%20Gaveston">Piers Gaveston</a>. Gaveston was a <a href="Gascony">Gascon</a> of relatively humble origins, with whom the king had developed a particularly close relationship. Among the honours Edward heaped upon Gaveston was the <a href="Earl%20of%20Cornwall">earldom of Cornwall</a>, a title which had previously only been conferred on members of the royal family. The preferential treatment of an upstart like Gaveston, in combination with his behaviour that was seen as arrogant, led to resentment among the established peers of the realm. This resentment first came to the surface in a declaration written in <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a> by a group of <a href="magnate">magnate</a>s who were with the king when he was in <a href="France">France</a> for his marriage ceremony to the French king's daughter. The so-called <a href="Boulogne%20agreement">Boulogne agreement</a> was vague, but it expressed clear concern over the state of the royal court. On 25 February 1308, the new king was crowned. The oath he was made to take at the coronation differed from that of previous kings in the fourth clause; here Edward was required to promise to maintain the laws that the community "shall have chosen" (""aura eslu""). Though it is unclear what exactly was meant by this wording at the time, this oath was later used in the struggle between the king and his earls.

In the parliament of April 1308, it was decided that Gaveston should be banned from the realm upon threat of <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a>. The king had no choice but to comply, and on 24 June, Gaveston left the country on appointment as <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland">Lieutenant of Ireland</a>. The king immediately started plotting for his favourite's return. At the parliament of April 1309, he suggested a compromise in which certain of the earls' petitions would be met in exchange for Gaveston's return. The plan came to nothing, but Edward had strengthened his hand for the <a href="Stamford%2C%20Lincolnshire">Stamford</a> parliament in July later that year by receiving a papal annulment of the threat of excommunication. The king agreed to the so-called "Statute of Stamford" (which in essence was a reissue of the "Articuli super Cartas" that his father had signed in 1300), and Gaveston was allowed to return.

The earls who agreed to the compromise were hoping that Gaveston had learned his lesson. Yet upon his return, he behaved worse than ever, conferring insulting nicknames on some of the greater nobles. When the king summoned a great council in October, several of the earls refused to meet due to Gaveston's presence. At the parliament of February in the following year, Gaveston was ordered not to attend. The earls disobeyed a royal order not to carry arms to parliament, and in full military attire presented a demand to the king for the appointment of a commission of reform. On 16 March 1310, the king agreed to the appointment of Ordainers, who were to be in charge of the reform of the royal household.

The Ordainers were elected by an assembly of magnates, without representation from the commons. They were a diverse group, consisting of eight <a href="earl">earl</a>s, seven <a href="bishop">bishop</a>s and six <a href="baron">baron</a>s – twenty-one in all. There were faithful royalists represented as well as fierce opponents of the king.

Among the Ordainers considered loyal to Edward II was <a href="John%20of%20Brittany%2C%20Earl%20of%20Richmond">John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond</a> who was also by this time one of the older remaining earls. John had served Edward I, his uncle, and was Edward II's first cousin. The natural leader of the group was <a href="Henry%20de%20Lacy%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Lincoln">Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln</a>. One of the wealthiest men in the country, he was also the oldest of the earls and had proved his loyalty and ableness through long service to Edward I. Lincoln had a moderating influence on the more extreme members of the group, but with his death in February 1311, leadership passed to his son-in-law and heir <a href="Thomas%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Thomas of Lancaster</a>. Lancaster – the king's cousin – was now in possession of five earldoms which made him by far the wealthiest man in the country, save the king. There is no evidence that Lancaster was in opposition to the king in the early years of the king's reign, but by the time of the Ordinances it is clear that something had negatively affected his opinion of King Edward.

Lancaster's main ally was <a href="Guy%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Guy Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick</a>. Warwick was the most fervently and consistently antagonistic of the earls, and remained so until his early death in 1315. Other earls were more amenable. <a href="Gilbert%20de%20Clare%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Hertford">Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester</a>, was Gaveston's brother-in-law and stayed loyal to the king. <a href="Aymer%20de%20Valence%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke</a>, would later be one of the king's most central supporters, yet at this point he found the most prudent course of action was to go along with the reformers. Of the barons, at least <a href="Robert%20de%20Clifford%2C%201st%20Baron%20de%20Clifford">Robert Clifford</a> and William Marshall seemed to have royalist leanings.

Among the bishops, only two stood out as significant political figures, the more prominent of whom was <a href="Robert%20Winchelsey">Robert Winchelsey</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. Long a formidable presence in English public life, Winchelsey had led the struggle against Edward I to uphold the autonomy of the church, and for this he had paid with suspension and exile. One of Edward II's first acts as king had been to reinstate Winchelsey, but rather than responding with grateful loyalty, the archbishop soon reassumed a leadership role in the fight against the king. Although he was trying to appease Winchelsey, the king carried an old grudge against another prelate, <a href="Walter%20Langton">Walter Langton</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lichfield">Bishop of Lichfield</a>. Edward had Langton dismissed from his position as <a href="Lord%20High%20Treasurer">treasurer of the Exchequer</a> and had his temporal possessions confiscated. Langton had been an opponent of Winchelsey during the previous reign, but Edward II's move against Langton drew the two Ordainers together.

Six preliminary ordinances were released immediately upon the appointment of the Ordainers – on 19 March 1310 – but it was not until August 1311 that the committee had finished its work. In the meanwhile Edward had been in Scotland on an aborted campaign, but on 16 August, Parliament met in <a href="London">London</a>, and the king was presented with the Ordinances.

The document containing the Ordinances is dated 5 October, and contains forty-one articles. In the preamble, the Ordainers voiced their concern over what they perceived as the evil councilors of the king, the precariousness of the military situation abroad, and the danger of rebellion at home over the oppressive prises. The articles can be divided into different groups, the largest of which deals with limitations on the powers of the king and his officials, and the substitution of these powers with baronial control. It was ordained that the king should appoint his officers only "by the counsel and assent of the baronage, and that in parliament." Furthermore, the king could no longer go to war without the consent of the baronage, nor could he make reforms of the coinage. Additionally, it was decided that parliament should be held at least once a year. Parallel to these decisions were reforms of the royal finances. The Ordinances banned what was seen as extortionate prises and customs, and at the same time declared that revenues were to be paid directly into the <a href="Exchequer">Exchequer</a>. This was a reaction to the rising trend of receiving revenues directly into the royal household; making all royal finances accountable to the exchequer allowed greater public scrutiny.

Other articles dealt with punishing specific persons, foremost among these, Piers Gaveston. Article 20 describes at length the offences committed by Gaveston; he was once more condemned to exile and was to abjure the realm by 1 November. The bankers of the Italian <a href="Frescobaldi">Frescobaldi</a> company were arrested, and their goods seized. It was held that the king's great financial dependence on the Italians was politically unfortunate. The last individuals to be singled out for punishment were <a href="Henry%20de%20Beaumont">Henry de Beaumont</a> and his sister, <a href="Isabella%20de%20Beaumont">Isabella de Vesci</a>, two foreigners associated with the king's household. Though it is difficult to say why these two received particular mention, it could be related to the central position of their possessions in the Scottish war.

The Ordainers also took care to confirm and elaborate on existing statutes, and reforms were made to the criminal law. The liberties of the church were confirmed as well. To ensure that none of the Ordainers should be swayed in their decisions by bribes from the king, restrictions were made on what royal gifts and offices they were allowed to receive during their tenure.

The Ordinances were published widely on 11 October, with the intention of obtaining maximum popular support. The decade following their publication saw a constant struggle over their repeal or continued existence. Although they were not finally repealed until May 1322, the vigour with which they were enforced depended on who was in control of government.

Before the end of the year, Gaveston had returned to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke's honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bannockburn">Battle of Bannockburn</a>, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.

What followed was a period of virtual control of the government by Lancaster, yet increasingly – particularly after the death of Warwick in 1315 – he found himself isolated. In August 1318, the so-called "<a href="Treaty%20of%20Leake">Treaty of Leake</a>" established a "<a href="modus%20vivendi">modus vivendi</a>" between the parties, whereby the king was restored to power while promising to uphold the Ordinances. Lancaster still had differences with the king, though—particularly with the conduct of the new favourite, <a href="Hugh%20the%20younger%20Despenser">Hugh Despenser the younger</a>, and <a href="Hugh%20Despenser%20the%20Elder">Hugh's father</a>. In 1322, full rebellion broke out which ended with Lancaster's defeat and execution at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Boroughbridge">Battle of Boroughbridge</a> in March. At the parliament of May in the same year, the Ordinances were repealed. However, six clauses were retained that concerned such issues as household jurisdiction and appointment of sheriffs. Any restrictions on royal power were unequivocally annulled.

The Ordinances were never again reissued, and therefore hold no permanent position in the legal history of England in the way that <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>, for instance, does. The criticism has been against the conservative focus of the barons' role in national politics, ignoring the ascendancy of the commons. Yet the document, and the movement behind it, reflected new political developments in its emphasis on how assent was to be obtained by the barons "in parliament". It was only a matter of time before it was generally acknowledged that the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">Commons</a> were an integral part of that institution.

a. The <a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> defines an "ordinance" as of "narrower scope, less permanent nature, or less constitutional character than a "law" or "statute"." The use of the word "new" (""novo"") is not to be understood in the sense that the Ordinances replaced an earlier set of ordinances.

b. The word "ordainer" was used by contemporaries simply as a descriptive noun, not as a title. "Lords Ordainers" is not found until the 19th century.

c. Much speculation has centred on whether Edward and Gaveston's relation was of a homosexual nature. An in-depth discussion of this issue – and an alternative to the predominant view – is presented by P. Chaplais.

d. According to contemporary sources, he called the Earl of Warwick "the black dog of <a href="Arden%2C%20Warwickshire">Arden</a>".

e. The Ordainers were chosen by indirect election; the barons elected two bishops while the bishops elected two barons. These four then elected two more barons, and these six finally co-opted the remaining fifteen. The process built on that behind the <a href="Provisions%20of%20Oxford">Provisions of Oxford</a> of 1258.

f. The Ordainers were: the Earls of <a href="Henry%20de%20Lacy%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Lincoln">Lincoln</a>, <a href="Aymer%20de%20Valence%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Pembroke</a>, <a href="Gilbert%20de%20Clare%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Hertford">Gloucester</a>, <a href="Thomas%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Lancaster">Lancaster</a>, <a href="Humphrey%20de%20Bohun%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Hereford">Hereford</a>, <a href="John%20de%20Bretagne%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Richmond">Richmond</a>, <a href="Guy%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Warwick</a> and <a href="Edmund%20FitzAlan%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">Arundel</a>; the <a href="Robert%20Winchelsey">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, the bishops of <a href="John%20Langton">Chichester</a>, <a href="List%20of%20bishops%20of%20London">London</a>, <a href="Bishops%20of%20Salisbury">Salisbury</a>, <a href="List%20of%20the%20Bishops%20of%20the%20Diocese%20of%20Norwich%2C%20England%20and%20its%20precursor%20offices">Norwich</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20David%27s">St. David's</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Llandaff">Llandaff</a>; and the barons Hugh de Vere, Hugh de Courtenay, Robert FitzRoger, John de Gray, William Marshall and William Martin, as well as Robert Clifford, who replaced FitzRoger on the latter's death. Neither McKisack or Prestwich supplies a complete list; while Prestwich omits the Bishops of Chichester and Norwich, McKisack fails to include Gray, and FitzRoger as the original appointee.

g. The traditional view is that the breach was caused by the ejection from court of one of Lancaster's dependants, on Gaveston's instigation. Maddicott points out that even though this event took place, it happened later – after Lancaster's defection.

h. These preliminary Ordinances were concerned, among other things, with royal grants, payment of customs, and the maintenance of <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>, reflected in the later paragraphs 3, 4 and 6; see below.

ESRB re-rating of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

In May 2006, the North American <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> (ESRB) changed the <a href="Video%20game%20content%20rating%20system">rating</a> of "," a <a href="video%20game">video game</a> for <a href="Personal%20computer">PCs</a>, the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, and eventually the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, from "Teen" (13+) to "Mature" (17+). The ESRB cited the presence of content not considered in their original review in the published edition of "Oblivion". This included detailed depictions of <a href="Graphic%20violence">blood and gore</a> and sexually explicit content. The sexually explicit content was an art file, made accessible by a third-party <a href="Mod%20%28video%20gaming%29">modification</a> called the "Oblivion Topless Mod", that rendered the game with <a href="Toplessness">topless</a> female characters.

In response to the new content, the ESRB conducted a new review of "Oblivion," showing to its reviewers the content originally submitted by the game's <a href="game%20publisher">publisher</a> along with the newly disclosed content. The new review resulted in an M rating. The ESRB reported that <a href="Bethesda%20Softworks">Bethesda Softworks</a>, the game's developer, would promptly notify all retailers of the change, issue stickers for retailers and distributors to affix on the product, display the new rating in all following product shipments and marketing, and create a downloadable <a href="patch%20%28computing%29">patch</a> rendering the topless skin inaccessible. Bethesda complied with the request, but issued a press release declaring their disagreement with the ESRB's rationale. Although certain retailers began to check for <a href="Identity%20document">ID</a> before selling "Oblivion" as a result of the change, and the change elicited criticism for the ESRB, the events passed by with little notice from the public at large. Other commentators remarked on the injustice of punishing a company for the actions of its clients, and one called the event a "pseudo-sequel" to the <a href="Hot%20Coffee%20minigame%20controversy">Hot Coffee minigame controversy</a>.

The <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">ESRB</a>'s review process involves the submission, by the game's publisher, of a video which captures all "pertinent content" in the game, where pertinent content is defined as any content that accurately reflects both the "most extreme content of the final product" and "the final product as a whole." That is to say, it must depict the "relative frequency" of said content. As ESRB President <a href="Patricia%20Vance">Patricia Vance</a> explains it, the ESRB would not just want a "tape of one extreme cut to another," but rather "context for the storyline, the missions, the features and functionality of a game, so that the raters really can get exposed to a pretty reasonable sense of what they'd experience playing the game." The fact that the content of "Oblivion" under investigation was inaccessible during normal play made no difference in the decision. ESRB policy had been "absolutely clear" since the Hot Coffee controversy, Patricia Vance told a reporter. Publishers were told that they could not leave unfinished or other pertinent content on a disc. If locked-out content was "pertinent to a rating," ESRB policy stated that it needed to be disclosed, and Bethesda had not done so.

Released in March 2006 and reported on game news sites as a curiosity in April of the same year, the "Oblivion Topless Mod" had been created by a woman calling herself "Maeyanie." Maeyanie created the mod in protest against what she called "government/society/whatever forcing companies to 'protect our innocent population from seeing those evil dirty things 50% of them possess personally anyways.'" The gaming website "<a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>" reported on the mod on April 6, 2006: "Modders are already hard at work on bending the code of the recently released PC version of "Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion" to their will. Early success: topless mod <a href="Internet%20slang">FTW</a>!" "<a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>", another gaming site, reporting on the mod on April 5, 2006, didn't consider the mod anything new and said, "As usual in the world of computer gaming, one of the very first mods released for a popular game allows you to see the breasts of the main character." The content of the mod, wrote commentator Michael Zenke, Editor of "<a href="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>" games, was fairly tame. Without nudity of the lower torso, and without self-consciousness on the part of the nude NPCs, Zenke wrote, the "Oblivion Topless Mod" was "as erotic as a doctor's visit." Pete Hines had discussed the mod with <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> staff before the game was re-rated, saying that he did not consider it a concern. "We can't control and don't condone the actions of anyone who alters the game so that it displays material that may be considered offensive. We haven't received any complaints on the issue from anyone."

During these investigations ESRB staff also found more blood and gore than the review tape had portrayed:
What Bethesda had originally disclosed to us, as an example: In that section of the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, you can see that it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.

In response to the new content, the ESRB hastily conducted a new review of "Oblivion", showing to its reviewers the content originally submitted by Bethesda along with the newly disclosed content. The new review resulted in a "Mature" rating. The ESRB reported that Bethesda, to correct for the discrepancy, would promptly notify all retailers of the change, issue stickers for retailers and distributors to affix on the product, display the new rating in all following product shipments and marketing, and create a patch for download rendering the topless skin inaccessible. In line with its stated mission of informing consumers regarding the age-suitability of its marked games, the ESRB also released an ESRB Parent Advisory, ensuring that parents would be "immediately notified" of the change.

Following news of the rating change on May 3, 2006, the <a href="Interactive%20Entertainment%20Merchants%20Association">Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association</a> (IEMA), an organization of game retailers, which had previously eased the adoption of industry-wide ratings enforcement, issued its own statement, lauding its own retailers for the speed with which they reacted to the rating change. The IEMA release further stated that identification was needed to secure the purchase of Mature-rated games at roughly the same rate as was needed for R-rated film admission. In compliance with the ESRB's further demand that Bethesda request retailers "to adhere to their respective store policies not to sell the newly rated M (Mature) game to those under the age of 17," several retailers had begun to include cash register prompts tied to the game's bar code, instructing the cashier to ask for ID. A report by <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> observed that some retailers—<a href="Circuit%20City%20%281949%E2%80%932009%20company%29">Circuit City</a> specifically—were even pulling the game from their shelves entirely, "presumably until rating modifications can be made."

Following the announcement of the rating change, Bethesda issued their own press release. Bethesda announced that it was their organization, not <a href="Take-Two%20Interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, that had handled the ratings application, and that they stood behind it. Bethesda would not contest the change, and would promptly seek to implement the ESRB's demands, without demanding a product recall. Nonetheless, Bethesda stated that "Oblivion" was not typical of Mature rated titles, and did not contain "central themes of violence" common to such titles. The response asserted that Bethesda's submission to the ESRB was "full, accurate, and comprehensive," following the forms and requirements published by the ESRB, and that nothing was withheld. Bethesda stressed that there was no nudity in their game without a modification, that the company "didn't create a game with nudity" and did not intend for nudity to appear in their game. "Bethesda can not control tampering with "Oblivion" by third parties," the press release concluded.

The <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">British Board of Film Classification</a> (BBFC), the ESRB's counterpart in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, did not change its rating of "15". "Were it the case that the developer themselves had included and failed to disclose certain modifications of content, a recall may be required, but not as a result of a patch that has been placed on the Internet by a third party," a BBFC spokesperson told <a href="GamesIndustry.biz">GamesIndustry.biz</a> reporters on May 4, 2006. Any modifications made after release fall outside the powers of the <a href="Video%20Recordings%20Act%201984">Video Recordings Act</a>.

In July 2007, the <a href="Pan%20European%20Game%20Information">Pan European Game Information</a> (PEGI) announced that it was extending its purview to cover "games playable online via consoles, PCs and mobiles." Websites or online retail games participating in the program would be granted a PEGI Online logo, specifying whether "the particular game or site is under the control of an operator that cares about protecting young people." An article by gaming website <a href="Shacknews">Shacknews</a> noted at the time that PEGI's initiative would address the concerns US publishers had with user-created mods for "San Andreas" and "Oblivion": responsibility for such mods would be placed on the participating publishers.

The events passed by with little concern from either the public or gaming journalists in particular. Zenke attributed the draw in attention to bigger stories that came later in May. The news, for example, came just a week before <a href="E3%202006">E3 2006</a>, the last E3 before the show changed from a grand spectacle to a reserved industry-only affair. The story did not pass completely unnoticed, as certain commentators issued statements regarding the issue in the days following the re-rating. On May 4, 2006, then-<a href="California%20State%20Assembly">California Assemblyman</a> <a href="Leland%20Yee">Leland Yee</a> used the rating change to criticize the ESRB. Yee, who had previously called on the ESRB to change their rating of "" to "AO" (Adults Only 18+), chastised the ESRB for failing parents again, and demonstrating their inability to police themselves. Yee called the ESRB's rating system drastically flawed, and called for further legislation to assist parents and protect children.

Game designer <a href="John%20Romero">John Romero</a>, lead designer of "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>", posted a statement in his <a href="blog">blog</a> criticizing the modders responsible:
Now what's going to happen? You'll probably start seeing game data files becoming encrypted and the open door on assets getting slammed shut just to keep modders from financially screwing the company they should be helping. And the day a game company's file encryption is hacked to add porn and the case goes to the ESRB for review – that's when we'll see how well game companies are protected from these antics and what the courts will rule. Hopefully it'll be on the developer's side. When the ratings change came, Zenke saw political caution in the move, rather than an intelligent response to new content. Previous scandals had forced the Board's hand, and the ratings change was an act of self-preservation. Zenke, writing in June 2007 for online gaming magazine "<a href="The%20Escapist%20%28magazine%29">The Escapist</a>", criticized the public for its failure to respond to the rating change, and emphasized what the change would mean to moddable games. At the core of Zenke's article was concern that a developer or publisher could be punished for content they neither produced nor distributed. Echoing Romero's concerns, Zenke saw the rating change as a threat, not only to modders, but to developers as well. Zenke asked what the ESRB would do in response to "Game 3.0" concepts, where community involvement is key. Referring to <a href="Sony">Sony</a>'s "<a href="LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a>", Zenke asked, "Will Sony provide personnel to review every fan-made level for offensive content? Will the ESRB?"

"The Escapist", thinking the issues of a year past had died down, especially since they hadn't aroused much concern on first coming to light, did not expect the discord that ensued; response on their forums was heated, and the ESRB took "vigorous exception" to the piece. Zenke conducted a follow-up interview with ESRB President Patricia Vance, who clarified that the reason for the re-classification, aside from the previously-undisclosed gore, centered around the fact that the texture for nude female breasts was created by Bethesda and already existed in the game's files, and was not created or added after the fact by the modder, similarly to the infamous "Hot Coffee" minigame from "". "In the case of Oblivion, the first thing we had heard about was the topless characters, where you can actually opt-in to play throughout the whole game with a topless character. That sounded like a mod to us, and we investigated, and we actually called Bethesda to determine if the art file being used in this mod was theirs, and they did confirm that it was. ... fully rendered. ... It wasn't a Barbie Doll image, it was fully rendered." In regard to what is considered by the ESRB for rating a game, Vance stated, "Our policies are quite clear: it's what's created by the publisher and included on the disc, not what's created or introduced by a mod. The mod may unlock it, the mod may make it accessible, but again, going back to the publisher's burden; putting the accountability on the publisher to fully account for the content that they create and they ship – that's all we care about." Vance went on to state that "ESRB can't rate content that is created by other players. We never have, we never tried, nor will we ever," and that the only warning ESRB issues regarding third-party content is "Game Experience May Change During Online Play."

I Don't Remember

"I Don't Remember" is a song by Australian <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> <a href="band%20%28music%29">band</a> <a href="Powderfinger">Powderfinger</a>, from the album "<a href="Dream%20Days%20at%20the%20Hotel%20Existence">Dream Days at the Hotel Existence</a>". It made its radio debut on 9 July 2007 on Australian radio stations, and was subsequently released as a <a href="single%20%28music%29">single</a> and <a href="Music%20download">digital download</a> on 4 August 2007 in Australia, 3 September 2007 in New Zealand, and 13 August 2007 in the United States.

The song was written by Powderfinger <a href="lead%20singer">lead singer</a> <a href="Bernard%20Fanning">Bernard Fanning</a>, and influenced by <a href="bassist">bassist</a> <a href="John%20Collins%20%28Australian%20musician%29">John Collins</a>. The <a href="riff">riff</a> was then developed by <a href="guitarist">guitarist</a> <a href="Ian%20Haug">Ian Haug</a>. The song is about reconciling difficulties and arguments, rather than shifting the blame.

"I Don't Remember" was lauded by some reviewers, who appreciated its energy, while other reviewers were more critical, dubbing it an "<a href="advertisement">advertisement</a> song". The music video also received critical acclaim, especially for the parodies it contained. Despite the reviews, the single charted poorly, reaching number 42 on the <a href="ARIA%20Singles%20Chart">ARIA Singles Chart</a>.

The song was written by the band's <a href="lead%20singer">lead singer</a>, Bernard Fanning, following a night he spent drinking with <a href="bassist">bassist</a> <a href="John%20Collins%20%28Australian%20musician%29">John Collins</a> towards the end of the recording phase of "<a href="Dream%20Days%20at%20the%20Hotel%20Existence">Dream Days at the Hotel Existence</a>". The song was written by Fanning on guitar, but he later wrote the main <a href="riff">riff</a> on piano, which was then converted into a lead guitar riff performed by <a href="Ian%20Haug">Ian Haug</a>. The guitars for the song are all tuned down one <a href="Key%20signature">step</a>; while the guitar finger positioning is played as though in the key of <a href="C%20major">C major</a>, the detuning brings the key of the song down to Bb, with the song leading off with Bb's relative minor, G minor. During the recording phase, Fanning suggested "softening" the main riff by returning it to the piano, and even recorded this concept; however this piano version did not end up in the final album mix, nor was it included as a <a href="B-side">B-side</a> on the single.

"I Don't Remember" was recorded in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> during pre-production for "Dream Days at the Hotel Existence". It contains a simple <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic</a> <a href="riff">riff</a>, similar to several songs on previous albums including "<a href="Vulture%20Street%20%28album%29">Vulture Street</a>". While recording the song in January 2007, Fanning said in an interview that:
This meaning was also evident in the song's lyrics. In the second line, Fanning states that "I made a mistake that I'll never surpass", before explaining that it does not matter whose fault it is, in saying "I know you needed someone to take the fall/I know you needed someone to blame it on". In the second verse, Fanning again reiterates that he feels pain in the mistake that was made, when he says "I found my heart and it broke like glass/I made that mistake that I'll never surpass".

John Collins said of the song:
When Powderfinger first played the song to <a href="Benmont%20Tench">Benmont Tench</a>, who would feature in a piano role throughout the album, he remarked that it reminded him of <a href="Buffalo%20Springfield">Buffalo Springfield</a>, who was an inspiration of <a href="Tom%20Petty%20and%20the%20Heartbreakers">Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers</a>. Fanning replied that "we were thinking more of the Heartbreakers", indicating the musical style intended in "I Don't Remember", but also paying homage to Tench, whom the band would work with extensively. Tench performed with the band on the album version of the song.

The music video for "I Don't Remember" was made by Fifty Fifty Films, who had previously collaborated with the band on the videos for "<a href="Like%20a%20Dog%20%28song%29">Like a Dog</a>", "<a href="%28Baby%20I%27ve%20Got%20You%29%20On%20My%20Mind">(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind</a>", and "<a href="Lost%20and%20Running">Lost and Running</a>", all nominated for <a href="ARIA%20Awards">ARIA Awards</a>.

The music video starts on a school bus with children playing and throwing things, and features a young boy who then selects the track "I Don't Remember" on his iPod and closes his eyes. He then dreams about a school concert for a band called "Littlefinger", a parody of the band for which he is the lead singer "Bernie", a parody of <a href="Bernard%20Fanning">Bernard Fanning</a>. The band and audience are composed of primary school students. Children are seen offering a chocolate milk called smilo, a take on <a href="Milo%20%28drink%29">Milo</a>, and a camera crew for "Channel [Z]" and reporter "Su-Mi". This is a parody of <a href="Yumi%20Stynes">Yumi Stynes</a>, a presenter from Australian music station <a href="Channel%20V">Channel V</a>. The end of the clip shows that it was a dream being had by the student who played the lead singer for "Littlefinger".

Many elements of "I Don't Remember"'s video received positive critical response for the usage of children in it. Kathy McCabe of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" summarised critical feelings towards the video, by suggesting in her review that "[maybe] bands should get kids to play them in videos forever".

In his review of "<a href="Dream%20Days%20at%20the%20Hotel%20Existence">Dream Days at the Hotel Existence</a>", "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald Sun HiT</a>" journalist Cameron Adams claimed that "I Don't Remember" was more of an <a href="advertisement">advertisement</a> style song, similar to "<a href="Lost%20and%20Running">Lost and Running</a>", the first single released from the album. Adams stated that "'I Don't Remember' is not the next single without reason—it does everything you expect a Powderfinger single to, perhaps a more appropriate 'ad' for this album." Sputnikmusic contributor James Bishop described "I Don't Remember" as unoriginal, but at the same time said that it proved Powderfinger "haven't forgotten how to write a good song".

<a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> reviewer Clayton Bolger, however, described it positively as a "stadium anthem" and stating that it was a good example of the "trademarks of classic Powderfinger" showcased on the album. The review labeled the song a "pick". Web Wombat's review of the album also treated the song positively, dubbing it "classic Powderfinger." Reviewer Andrew Tijs from CitySearch Brisbane stated that the song is "a smoothly emotive jangle-rock tune with a purposeful chorus and Fanning's inimitable vocal", though provides mixed reviews when compared with other songs by the group, noting that "It's no eerie ballad like '<a href="The%20Day%20You%20Come">The Day You Come</a>', nor does it have '<a href="Like%20a%20Dog%20%28song%29">Like a Dog</a>'<nowiki>'</nowiki>s snarl, nor '<a href="%28Baby%20I%27ve%20Got%20You%29%20On%20My%20Mind">On My Mind</a>'<nowiki>'</nowiki>s pub rock shudder."

"I Don't Remember" was performed regularly on the <a href="Across%20the%20Great%20Divide%20Tour">Across the Great Divide Tour</a>, generally with positive responses. FasterLouder reviewer gumbuoy stated that "The new songs are excellent live; I Don't Remember has more energy than its recorded counterpart (Lost and Running)", following by praising the album and performance as a whole.

"I Don't Remember" entered the Australian Singles Chart at #43, then slid to #47 in its second week, but then reached its pinnacle position of #42 in its third week. It then remained in the charts for the following three weeks in the upper forties, and then dropped off the chart. It was released as a single in New Zealand and the United States also, but failed to chart, despite moderate airplay in New Zealand.

Development of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion

The development of "" began in 2002, immediately after its predecessor, "", was published. Rumors of a sequel to "Morrowind" began circulating in June 2004; the sequel's title was identified on September 10, 2004, the date of its official announcement. "Oblivion" was developed by <a href="Bethesda%20Game%20Studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a>, and the initial <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a> (PC) releases were co-published by Bethesda and <a href="Take-Two%20Interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s subsidiary, <a href="2K%20Games">2K Games</a>. According to interviews with Bethesda staff, the publisher-developer relationship—one of the few independent relations in the industry—worked well, and Bethesda was not subject to excessive corporate guidance. Originally scheduled for a November 22, 2005, release, in tandem with the Xbox 360's launch, "Oblivion" was delayed to a March 21, 2006, release for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> PCs and the Xbox 360.

Developers working on "Oblivion" focused on providing a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters. The developers sought to make information in the game world more accessible to players, making the game easier to pick up and play. "Oblivion" features improved <a href="Artificial%20intelligence">AI</a> (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary <a href="Radiant%20AI">Radiant AI</a>), improved physics (courtesy of the <a href="Havok%20%28software%29">Havok</a> physics engine), and impressive <a href="Computer%20graphics">graphics</a>, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like <a href="high-dynamic-range%20rendering">high-dynamic-range rendering</a> (HDR) and <a href="specularity">specular mapping</a>. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the creation of "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a drain on Bethesda's staff.

A <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> version of "Oblivion" was released on March 20, 2007, in North America, and April 27, 2007, in Europe, following delays similar to those for the Xbox 360 release. The PlayStation 3 release was touted for its improvement over the graphics of the PC and Xbox 360 versions, although some of the improved shader routines optimized for the PlayStation 3 release were set to be ported over to the other releases through <a href="patch%20%28computing%29">patches</a>. A plan to distribute content through downloads paid by <a href="micropayment">micropayment</a> was initially met with criticism by customers due to its alleged low value, but later releases—at a reduced price, and with more content—proved more popular.

The first rumors of another "Elder Scrolls" release after "" began to circulate in June 2004, following Bethesda's posting of an e-mail searching for new staff. The new staff members were to participate on a team that would push "the bleeding-edge of RPG development for the PC and <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28seventh%20generation%29">future-generation consoles</a>". For those considering the job, the e-mail suggested that "knowledge of ... The Elder Scrolls [is] a plus". At the time, a member of Bethesda's staff played down the importance of the last comment, noting that Bethesda would "obviously" prefer applicants familiar with the company's products. Rumors were confirmed on July 12, 2004, when it was announced that "<a href="Fallout%203">Fallout 3</a>" and the next "Elder Scrolls" title would be published by Bethesda and produced by Todd Howard. The title of the release was listed on September 10, 2004, when Bethesda officially announced the identity of the game in question: "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion", followed by a feature in the October 2004 issue of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>". At the time of the announcement, Bethesda had been working on "Oblivion" for two years (since 2002), just as Bethesda was completing work on "Morrowind".

Although preliminary reports from <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> suggested an "Oblivion" release in tandem with the launch of the Xbox 360 on November 22, 2005, and the original announcement of the game set a release date of Winter 2005, <a href="Take-Two%20Interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> announced, during a conference call with analysts on October 31, 2005, that "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release was to be delayed until the second quarter of Take-Two's fiscal year. The new schedule would put the release between February and April 2006. The delay surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with "Oblivion". News of the delay came at a time following a burst of bad news from the company, including a 60% drop in expected earnings per share, the ongoing <a href="Hot%20Coffee%20minigame%20controversy">Hot Coffee minigame controversy</a>, worse than average sales for the company's flagship "", sudden drops in share prices, and delays for other company products.

Most commentators blamed Take-Two's corporate governance; one analyst stated that the company's troubles were more "company-specific than market-driven", and another declared company CEO <a href="Paul%20Eibeler">Paul Eibeler</a> to be the "worst CEO of 2005", pointing to "setbacks on the rollouts of newer games" as evidence of his failure. Pete Hines, Vice President of PR and Marketing for Bethesda, and <a href="Todd%20Howard%20%28video%20game%20designer%29">Todd Howard</a>, Executive Producer for the game, gave an update about the delay on the weekend of November 6, 2005. They planned to give updates every subsequent weekend until the game's release. A commentator from <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a> complained of the vagueness of the updates: "they don't get any more specific than to say, 'There is work that still needs to be done'. In fact, they say this three times just to make sure we know how hard they are working ... While it's nice to see the development team taking time out to update the fans, if the announcements continue to be as vague as this one, I'd rather just see them spend the extra time on the actual game."

On May 16, 2005, Bethesda announced that they would be releasing "Oblivion" on <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s Xbox 360, and that the game's public debut would come at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> on May 18, 2005. The version shown at E3 was substantially finished; most content was already in the game, lacking only the polish that the final months of development would bring. The game's world, for example, had already been fully constructed but still needed to undergo a "clutter pass", wherein minor game items—"books, weapons, and thousands of forks and plates"—are dropped into the game world.

Howard himself never took to the show. "It's like a beauty pageant", he told one reporter. "I have 20 minutes to give you a presentation on our games that by their nature are hard to demo in that time period, and then the person is going to check their watch and walk out and go see someone else's demo." Hines aimed to play against the standard convention at the show, avoiding the "noise and lights and heat and masses" of the show floor by retiring to a mini-theater—with air-conditioning, comfortable seating, and dim lighting—where attendees could comfortably watch. Howard agreed with the choice: "We've always taken sort of the meeting room approach. We don't have loud crazy booths."

During Microsoft's E3 pre-show conference, a ten-second preview of "Oblivion" was shown amid demo reels for other games. The preview consisted of a series of brief second-long shots of the game. Later on, during E3 proper, Bethesda showed a longer 25-minute demo that showcased further clipped scenes: the opening dungeon, a procedurally rendered forest, one of the game's towns, and other locales. Most viewers were impressed by "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s showing. In the words of one reporter, ""The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion" isn't just one of the brightest gems in the Xbox 360's upcoming launch lineup, but it's also perhaps a perfect example of a next-generation role-playing game." "Oblivion" won a number of "best of" awards from a variety of game journalists: <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s "RPG Game of Show" <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s "Best RPG", <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s "Best PC RPG", RPGFan's "Best Overall Game of E3 2005", and, most prestigiously, the "Best Role Playing Game" in the 2005 E3 Game Critics Awards.

A near-final build of "Oblivion" would later be shown at Microsoft's <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> press tent—but not at its public Xbox 360 booth—in January 2006, showcasing the game's exteriors. A Joystiq reporter at the scene was not entirely impressed, finding the demo marred by long load times and slowdowns during combat. An Xbox representative reassured the reporter that all such issues would be worked out before the game's retail release. In the months prior to release, anticipation for the game ran high, with critics describing "Oblivion" as "the first next-gen game" only heightening attention. "People were expecting the game to cure blindness and heal the sick," said Hines.

After an almost four-month delay, "Oblivion" went gold on March 2, 2006, and was released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> on March 21, 2006. Early rumors notwithstanding, "Oblivion" shipped on a single <a href="DVD-DL">DVD-DL</a> disc. One journalist voiced concern for the game's release date, as it was set in the same week as that of <a href="Electronic%20Arts">EA</a>'s "". Hines dismissed the suggestion, saying, "We tend to focus on what we can control and not worry about what we can't control. Given the level of interest and the number of pre-orders and so forth, we had a pretty good idea we'd be just fine no matter what else was happening that week." "Oblivion" was the first RPG title to be released for <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s Xbox 360 console. In addition to the standard release version, a "Collector's Edition" was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 which includes the 112-page "Pocket Guide to the Empire", a bonus DVD containing concept art, renders, and an approximately 45-minute-long <a href="documentary%20film">documentary</a> on the making of "Oblivion", and a <a href="coin">coin</a> replica of the in-game currency of <a href="Tamriel">Tamriel</a>. Its suggested release price of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>69.99 brought back "memories of game prices circa the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>" for one <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a> commentator. Some suggested that the included coin be used to create a "garish piece of jewelry".

"Oblivion" was well received in the gaming press; there was no critical disappointment, no "bump" in popular expectations, that might have been expected for such a highly anticipated game. <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, an aggregate review site, gave the game a 94% score; <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> and <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> each gave the game their own individual "RPG of the Year" award. "Oblivion" also sold well, selling 1.7 million copies by April 10, 2006. Additionally, 3 million copies were sold by January 18, 2007. Pete Hines was satisfied with the release: "I feel like we delivered on what people expected... I think the scores and awards reflect that we delivered on people's expectations."

The PS3 version of the game was ported/developed by <a href="4J%20Studios">4J Studios</a> who have worked with Bethesda in other projects. In April 2006, an inadvertently mailed version of Bethesda's supposed forthcoming game release list began a series of unconfirmed rumors of "Oblivion" releases for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> (PSP). The list suggested that "Oblivion" would be a PlayStation 3 <a href="launch%20title">launch title</a>, and that the PSP version would be released in November. These rumors were confirmed on September 28, 2006, when Bethesda officially announced the titles, setting the PlayStation 3 version's North American release date for November 2006, European release date for March 2007, and the PSP version for Spring 2007. The two titles were set to be published by Bethesda alone in North America, and with <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> as a co-publisher in Europe. Hines was mum regarding the change in publishers: "Too much backroom stuff." Ubisoft saw their first quarter sales for 2007 rise 90.5%, to 134 million <a href="Euro">Euro</a>s, exceeding previous forecasts by 14 million Euros. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot attributed the rise to "new-generation consoles and the impact of PlayStation 3 game sales, including "" and "Oblivion"".

Despite the title being included in Sony's announced PlayStation 3 launch lineup at its annual Gamers' Day event in San Francisco, online retailers <a href="Electronics%20Boutique">EBgames.com</a> and <a href="GameStop">Gamestop.com</a>—two sites with a history of revealing the release dates of games before their publisher's announcements—were found on November 8, 2006 to have set "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release date as January 1, 2007. Some few hours later, the delay was confirmed, as Pete Hines issued the statement that "Oblivion PS3 is now a Q1 2007 title". Hines gave no reason for the delay, but the news stirred suspicions of development difficulties working with the PlayStation 3, and that Bethesda was discouraged by the scarcity of PlayStation 3 consoles at launch. The North American PS3 release was later confirmed to be March 20, 2007, near the end of the first quarter window, with the European PS3 release set at April 27, 2007. Some reporters commented on a perceived parallelism between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 delays and releases.

<a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> video games retailer <a href="GAME%20%28retailer%29">GAME</a> encountered distribution problems on release day in Europe. A branch on <a href="Oxford%20Street">Oxford Street</a> reported to "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games%20%28magazine%29">Computer and Video Games</a>" (CVG), a video games magazine, that no units were in stock on the afternoon of April 27, 2007, and that other stores were in the same predicament. Other reports suggested that the game was not available in any of GAME's 400 UK and <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> stores. GAME staff nonetheless told "CVG" reporters that copies would be available by next week, "possibly Monday". An Ubisoft representative attributed the shortage to high demand for the product, and stated that copies were available online and at other <a href="High%20Street">High Street</a> retailers. Other retailers, such as <a href="HMV">HMV</a> and <a href="Virgin%20Megastore">Virgin Megastore</a>, reported no shortages.

In 2002, Bethesda's "Elder Scrolls" team was split in two: half, mostly <a href="Game%20designer">designers</a> and <a href="Game%20artist">artists</a>, were sent to work on "Morrowind" ; and the rest, mostly <a href="Game%20programmer">programmers</a>, were sent to work on technology for "Oblivion". Ken Rolston, a former designer for "Morrowind", was signed on as the game's Lead Designer. Code for the PC and Xbox 360 were somewhat interchangeable, owing to the similarity in system architecture between the consoles, but the team still had to divide its programming staff between the two. A number of staff with experience in developing for <a href="Sony">Sony</a> platforms like the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> worked on optimizing the code for the subsequent <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> release. The art and design staff were largely unaffected by the need to develop for multiple consoles.

On February 3, 2005, Bethesda entered into an agreement with <a href="Take-Two%20Interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> regarding the publication and release of "Oblivion". Under the agreement, Bethesda would retain full control over "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s development and the rights to any possible sequels, and Take-Two would agree to publish the game under its recently formed <a href="2K%20Games">2K Games</a> sub brand. According to Producer Gavin Carter, the team's experience was a rarity in the industry; few independent developer-publisher relationships still exist, and it was a surprise that Bethesda's experience worked out as well as it did. Carter described Take-Two's role as one of minimal interference, and the company mostly left Bethesda's development teams alone, trusting them to produce a "fantastic product" with minimal interference or "red tape". The relationship was a rarity in the industry, according to Carter, where most developers are beholden to their publishers. Ashley Cheng, "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s senior producer, concurred. There was "complete freedom" at Bethesda to decide their own path, whatever market trends might say. Of the legal proceedings affecting Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax during the initial stages of game development, when Bethesda founder Christopher Weaver sued the company for severance pay, Todd Howard said that he, as a producer, wasn't involved with corporate affairs. "I just focus on the games."

The team's goal then was, in the words of Todd Howard, to "create the quintessential RPG of the next generation", with a focus on a "combination of freeform gameplay and cutting-edge graphics". Producing for next generation machines, rather than a cheap upgrade, gave Bethesda an additional four years of development. Howard describes this as an aspect of Bethesda's greater goal of "Reinvention", where the team's goal is to make "a new game that stands on its own, that has its own identity". Howard spoke of the need to avoid repetition, to avoid merely adding "some new features and content, and keep doing that", describing that path as "a good way to drive your games into the ground". Bethesda, Howard stated, would focus instead on recapturing what made its past titles exciting "in the first place".

Keeping with the spirit of past games, Howard promised to keep with the spirit of "big-world, do-anything"-style games, feeling that a certain size and number of choices were needed to make role-playing feel "meaningful"; but now there was to be greater emphasis on keeping the game focused. Pete Hines saw the developments between games as less an issue of design focus and more as a "natural side effect of improving and refining how the game works". If smart decisions were made, ease of play would naturally follow. "Oblivion" would include fewer NPCs and quests than "Morrowind", and mindless filler, which Howard felt the team had been guilty of in the past, would be avoided. In exchange, Producer Gavin Carter later explained, there would be greater focus on length and depth in the quests, adding more "alternate paths", more characters "to connect with, who actually have personalities". Carter cast negative aspersions on aspects of gameplay too far removed from the game's central plot. Carter stated that such material was not needed, preferring instead that the focus be on the plot, on "fighting these demon lords", and that further material is "tertiary" and "takes away".

The role of the player character in the main quest was to be changed as well. In contrast to past games, where the player character would play a type of "chosen one", "Oblivion" would have the player character "find him, protect him, and help him". Aside from that, in the opinion of Hines, "the main quest has similar themes and tones as in past Elder Scrolls games", and should still feel "epic", simply because of the way the gamespace is designed: with openness in mind. Improving that aspect of the experience, said Hines, came mostly in the form of improved information presentation. The system would not intrude on the experience when the player merely wishes to "walk around and explore the world and do whatever he/she wants", but given the scenario where the player asks OK, I'm ready to do the next part of the main quest, where do I go?, the game would provide a ready answer, so as to avoid "confusion" and "downtime".

The Xbox 360 was set as "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s base platform, being the "easiest to develop for", in the words of Pete Hines; the PC, being more like a "random amalgamation of graphics cards and RAM and processors", and poorly "defined". As they had done with previous games in the series, Bethesda threw out their old content and technology and began work anew. A new engine was envisioned, one which would take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines, like <a href="high-dynamic-range%20rendering">high-dynamic-range rendering</a> and <a href="specularity">specular mapping</a>. The final product was shipped with an engine formed of a mixture of in-house tech and Numerical Design Limited's <a href="Gamebryo">Gamebryo</a> engine, "tricked out" in collaboration with Bethesda's graphics programmers and NDL. Cheng has described the game as "<a href="pixel%20shader">pixel-shader</a> heavy", taking advantage of the feature in rendering "metal, wood, stone, blood, skin", in addition to water, which was the only use "Morrowind" made of the technology. In particular, "Oblivion" uses <a href="normal%20mapping">normal maps</a>, diffuse maps, specular maps, and <a href="parallax%20mapping">parallax maps</a>, which Howard described as "kind of like <a href="displacement%20mapping">displacement mapping</a>". "Oblivion" makes use of <a href="Radiant%20AI">Radiant AI</a>, a new artificial intelligence system that allows non-player characters to dynamically react and interact with the world around them. General goals, such as "Eat at this city at 2pm" are given to NPCs, and NPCs are left to determine how to achieve them. The absence of individual scripting for each character allowed for the construction of a world on a much larger scale than other games had developed, and aided in the creation of what Todd Howard described as an "organic feel" for the game.

Features introduced for the new release that had been absent in "Morrowind" included "full facial animations, lip synching, and full speech for all dialogue". "Oblivion" uses <a href="Havok%20%28software%29">Havok</a> as its physics engine, following in the footsteps of "<a href="Half-Life%202">Half-Life 2</a>". Havok is involved in modeling the game's representations of <a href="telekinesis">telekinesis</a>, theft, traps, tumbling, paralysis, <a href="area%20effect">area effect</a> fireball explosions, and the contact between arrows and their targets. Arrows, in "Oblivion", may lodge themselves in objects and thereby increase their mass.

The inclusion of procedural content tools allowed for the creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than was the case with "Morrowind". Using Interactive Data Visualization, Inc. (IDV)'s <a href="SpeedTree">SpeedTree</a> technology, for example, Bethesda artists were able to "quickly generate complex and organic tree shapes with relative ease". With its "parent/child <a href="hierarchy">hierarchies</a> and <a href="iteration">iterative</a> <a href="branching%20%28software%29">branch</a> levels highly modifiable cylinder <a href="Geometric%20primitive">primitives</a>", Bethesda's Noah Berry attests that "an entire tree shape can be created in a manner of minutes, just by adjusting numerical values and tweaking <a href="spline%20%28mathematics%29">spline</a> curve handles". Instead of "Morrowind"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s artificially smoothed-over terrain, erosion algorithms incorporated in the landscape generation tools allowed for the creation of "craggy mountain vistas" quickly and easily.

The PS3 release featured a number of technical improvements over the Xbox 360 release; load times were reduced, fewer framerate drops were experienced and several bugs were fixed. Draw distance was increased, and new shaders were included to render the foreground cleanly and sharply, leading to rocky landscapes with "craggy appearances" rather than "smooth, non-distinct surfaces". The new shader sets blended "near detail" and "far detail" onscreen, removing the harsh line that cut between them in previous releases. Bethesda decided against implementing <a href="SIXAXIS">SIXAXIS</a> motion support for the game, considering "Oblivion" not to be of a type well-suited to such a feature. The "Knights of the Nine" content pack was included with the game, but other downloadable content releases were not. The latter release spawned a host of rumors across the Internet: a 1UP piece stated that the content was removed due to its negative effect on console performance, and other websites repeated the claim. Limitations of the PS3's system memory were suspected as the potential cause of the performance drop.

In an article for IGN, Pete Hines challenged the statements, providing an alternate rationale for the content packages' absence. Firstly, he stated, the expansions were removed to avoid giving a PS3 player an early advantage over other consoles' players. Secondly, he stated, the game designers were unfamiliar with the <a href="PlayStation%20Network%23PlayStation%20Store">PlayStation Network Store</a> and Sony's online content distribution systems, and had not yet determined the best method of releasing the packages. The suggestion that the PS3's technical makeup determined the move could not be "farther from the truth". Hines confirmed that the shader improvements for the PS3 would eventually migrate to the PC and Xbox 360 through further patches, but noted that some optimizations would remain exclusive to the PS3. In the end, the Xbox 360 and the PS3 would be "very much on a par" in their graphical performance.

From April 2006 onwards, Bethesda began releasing small, <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable packages of content</a> from their website and over the <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Marketplace">Xbox Live Marketplace</a>, for prices equivalent to between one and three <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US dollars</a>. The first package, a set of horse armor for "Oblivion"s steeds, was released on April 3, 2006, costing 200 <a href="Microsoft%20Points">Marketplace points</a>, equivalent to <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>2.50 or £1.50; the corresponding PC release cost was <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>1.99. Bethesda offered no rationale for the price discrepancy. These were not the first "Oblivion"-related Marketplace releases (the first was a series of dashboard themes and picture packs released prior to "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s publication, in February 2006, for a nominal fee) nor were they entirely unexpected: Bethesda had previously announced their desire to support the Xbox release with downloadable Marketplace content, and other publishers had already begun to release similar packages for their games, at similar prices. A November 2005-release of a "Winter Warrior Pack" for "" was also priced at 200 Marketplace points, and similar content additions had been scheduled for "<a href="Project%20Gotham%20Racing%203">Project Gotham Racing 3</a>" and "<a href="Perfect%20Dark%20Zero">Perfect Dark Zero</a>". Indeed, Marketplace content additions formed a significant part of a March 2006 Microsoft announcement regarding the future of <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a>. "Downloadable in-game content is a main focus of Microsoft's strategy heading into the next-gen console war", stated one <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> reporter. "With more consoles on their way to retail, 80 games available by June, and new content and experiences coming to Xbox Live all the time, there has never been a better time to own an Xbox 360", announced <a href="Peter%20Moore%20%28business%29">Peter Moore</a>. Nonetheless, although <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a> games, picture packs, <a href="Xbox%20360%20Dashboard">dashboards</a> and profile themes continued to be a Marketplace success for Microsoft, the aforementioned in-game content remained sparse. Pete Hines asserted,
"We were the first ones to do downloadable content like that—some people had done similar things, but no one had really done additions where you add new stuff to your existing game." There was no pressure from Microsoft to make the move.

April 4 also saw the announcement of two new downloadable content packs for the coming weeks: an "Orrery" quest that would see gamers setting out to repair a Dwarven Orrery; and a "Wizard's Tower" that would offer a new home for player characters, complete with the capacity to grow herbs, summon atronachs, and make spells. 1UP predicted that, given Bethesda's response to customer criticism, those releases would be somewhat more substantial than the "Horse Armor" release was. On April 7, Bethesda priced the "Orrery". Offering what GameSpot called "more bang for less buck", Bethesda set the PC release price at <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>1.88. Joystiq offered their support—Big ups—to the company for the new price. "Although we passed on the $2.50 horse armor this week, we'll definitely be messin' with that Orrery device when it hits the Marketplace." The pack was eventually released on April 17. Also on April 7, <a href="EB%20Games">EB Games</a> and <a href="GameStop">GameStop</a> began offering a coupon promising one free download of the "Horse Armor" pack with every purchase of the PC edition of "Oblivion". The "Wizard's Tower", called the "Frostcrag Spire" in-game, was released on April 24 for the same price as the "Orrery".

New releases continued into late 2006. The "Thieves' Den", a 2.27MB download offering the chance to "Uncover a famous pirate's lost ship and claim it for your own", was released on May 22 for the Xbox 360, priced at 150 Marketplace points, "roughly" equivalent to <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>1.89. Explaining the add-on, Ashley Cheng stated "Basically, it's "<a href="The%20Goonies">Goonies</a>"." "Mehrunes' Razor", a quest revolving around a mage in search of the deadly Daedric artifact known as Mehrunes' Razor, was released on June 14. It became the most expensive download yet, at <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>2.99 for PC users and 250 Marketplace points, equivalent to <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>3.13, for Xbox 360 owners. One <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> reporter took the occasion to reflect on the increasing price of owning the "complete" "Oblivion". With all the add-ons included, he calculated, "That's over $80 in game for the complete version of Oblivion, thus far." Foreseeing eventual problems with the upcoming <a href="PS3">PS3</a> release, and a potential bundling of all the software for a cheaper price, he wondered: "will Xbox 360 and PC users feel slighted? ... Microtransactions are sticky business." Joystiq continued to comment on the "Horse Armor" add-on in their notice of the quest's release. "With a weapon like that, who needs horse armor?" On July 13, "The Vile Lair", sporting a hidden crypt called "Deepscorn Hollow" for players bitten with "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s vampirism bug, was released. Like the "Orrery" and the "Wizard's Tower", Bethesda set "The Vile Lair"'s PC release price at <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>1.88. Joystiq responded positively to the new price point. "What a bargain! ... It's good to see the folks at "Oblivion" have learned their lesson and aren't offering relatively super expensive content not fit to see the light of day."

On August 31, "Spell Tomes", adding books with "wondrous and powerful magic spells", to the random loot of fallen foes, was released, for the price of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>1.00 on both the Xbox 360 and the PC. Beginning on December 22 and continuing on until the end of the year, Bethesda offered their "Mehrunes Razor" package free of charge, as a sort of holiday gift. "Oblivion"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s final content pack, named "Fighter's Stronghold", was released October 15, 2007. It was free to download in the first week after its release.

Lady Blue (TV series)

Lady Blue is an American <a href="Detective%20fiction">detective</a> and <a href="Action%20adventure%20film">action-adventure</a> television series. Produced by <a href="David%20Gerber">David Gerber</a>, it originally aired for one season on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> (ABC) network from September 15, 1985, to January 25, 1986. It was picked up by ABC after its pilot aired as a <a href="television%20film">television film</a> on April 15, 1985. The show revolves around <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> detective Katy Mahoney (<a href="Jamie%20Rose">Jamie Rose</a>) and her violent methods of handling cases. The supporting cast includes <a href="Danny%20Aiello">Danny Aiello</a>, <a href="Ron%20Dean">Ron Dean</a>, Diane Dorsey, <a href="Bruce%20A.%20Young">Bruce A. Young</a>, <a href="Nan%20Woods">Nan Woods</a>, and <a href="Ricardo%20Gutierrez">Ricardo Gutierrez</a>. <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a> also <a href="Guest%20appearance">guest-starred</a> on the series in one of his earliest roles. With cinematography by Jack Priestley, the episodes were filmed <a href="Location%20shooting">on location</a> in Chicago. <a href="Television%20criticism">Television critics</a> noted "Lady Blue" emphasis on violence, calling Mahoney "Dirty Harriet" (after <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>'s character <a href="Dirty%20Harry%20%28character%29">Dirty Harry</a>). Rose said that she joined the project after being drawn to its genre. She prepared for the role by watching Eastwood's films, received advice from Eastwood on how to handle a gun, and practiced at a <a href="shooting%20range">shooting range</a>.

After the pilot aired, "Lady Blue" was criticized by several <a href="watchdog%20organization">watchdog organization</a>s (particularly the National Coalition on Television Violence) as the most violent show on television. ABC moved the series between several time slots before cancelling it in 1986, partially due to the complaints about excessive violence. Critical reception to the series was primarily negative during its run, but <a href="television%20studies">television studies</a> author Cary O'Dell questions whether that stemmed from contemporary sexism. "Lady Blue" has not been released on DVD, Blu-ray, or an <a href="Streaming%20media">online streaming</a> service. The series' rights are owned by <a href="Metro-Goldwyn%20Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn Mayer</a>, but there are no plans for future home releases.

A <a href="Detective%20fiction">detective</a> and <a href="Action%20adventure%20film">action-adventure</a> television series, "Lady Blue" revolves around <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> investigator Katy Mahoney (<a href="Jamie%20Rose">Jamie Rose</a>), her violent means of dealing with criminals and tension with her co-workers. She works in the Violent Crimes Division of the <a href="Chicago%20Police%20Department">Chicago Police Department</a>. The "<a href="New%20York%20Observer">New York Observer</a>" Bryan Reesman described Mahoney as "the fiery red head" with a "trigger happy" personality and "violent excesses". She frequently uses a <a href=".357%20Magnum">.357 Magnum</a> (which John J. O'Connor of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called "a grotesque extension of her right arm"), and was introduced as capable of "read[ing] a crime in progress like most guys read the sports page".

Mahoney's reliance on violence is emphasized in the opening scene of the <a href="Television%20pilot">pilot</a>; she sees a bank robbery while she is in a beauty parlor, shoots and kills three of the perpetrators, and returns to the salon for a <a href="pedicure">pedicure</a>. <a href="Television%20criticism">Television critics</a> and the show's promotional materials called Mahoney "Dirty Harriet" and "Dirty Harriette", comparing her aggressive behavior to <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>'s character <a href="Dirty%20Harry%20%28character%29">Dirty Harry</a>, and Jon Anderson of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" described her as "somewhat like <a href="Quick%20Draw%20McGraw">Quick Draw McGraw</a> with touches of <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a> and Clint Eastwood". According to Rose, Mahoney was inspired by Dirty Harry, Wayne, and <a href="Rambo%20%28film%20series%29">Rambo</a>. Mahoney and other characters refer to the number of <a href="Excessive%20force">excessive-force complaints</a> filed against her during the series, and she often has difficulties with <a href="Internal%20affairs%20%28law%20enforcement%29">Internal Affairs</a>.

Although Mahoney was portrayed at odds with most of her superiors, her boss <a href="Lieutenant">Lt.</a> Terry McNichols (<a href="Danny%20Aiello">Danny Aiello</a>) is more sympathetic and understanding towards her. McNichols is portrayed as fond of <a href="chili%20dog">chili dog</a>s and appreciative of Mahoney's more unorthodox methods of handling criminals, although he still criticizes her reliance on violence. Rose described McNichols as similar to a character in the <a href="crime%20drama">crime drama</a> "<a href="The%20Sopranos">The Sopranos</a>". Describing Aiello's performance, O'Connor wrote that McNichols "offer[ed] an uncanny impersonation of the punch-drunk <a href="Maxie%20Rosenbloom">Slapsie Maxie Rosenbloom</a> in a 1940's movie".

Mahoney's father, brother, and married lover were killed in the <a href="Line%20of%20duty%20death">line of duty</a> before the series begins, and O'Connor connected these events to the character's "toughness and determination to survive". Other characters include detective Gino Gianelli (<a href="Ron%20Dean">Ron Dean</a>) and his wife Rose (Diane Dorsey), Officer Cassidy (<a href="Bruce%20A.%20Young">Bruce A. Young</a>), McNichols' niece Willow (<a href="Nan%20Woods">Nan Woods</a>), and Mahoney's <a href="informant">informant</a> Harvey (<a href="Ricardo%20Gutierrez">Ricardo Gutierrez</a>). In one of his earliest roles, American actor <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a> <a href="Guest%20appearance">guest-starred</a> in an episode as the brother of a serial killer. Mexican actress <a href="Katy%20Jurado">Katy Jurado</a> appeared in the pilot as <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> <a href="Boss%20%28crime%29">kingpin</a> Dona Maria Theresa, and American actors <a href="Ajay%20Naidu">Ajay Naidu</a> and <a href="Jim%20Brown">Jim Brown</a> portrayed "worldly-wise waif" Paquito and a "South Side drug czar", respectively. Aiello's best friend was an <a href="Extra%20%28acting%29">extra</a> in the series, the cast and crew calling his character "Detective Joe Background". Tom Shales of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" described the show's tone as "baldly campy [and] ultra-violent".

The <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a> of "Lady Blue" was <a href="David%20Gerber">David Gerber</a>. Directors <a href="Guy%20Magar">Guy Magar</a> and <a href="Gary%20Nelson%20%28director%29">Gary Nelson</a> worked on the series, while Jack Priestley was the cinematographer. Produced by <a href="MGM%20Television">MGM Television</a> and David Gerber Productions, its musical score was composed by <a href="John%20Cacavas">John Cacavas</a>. Actress <a href="Arnetia%20Walker">Arnetia Walker</a> performed the show's theme song, "Back to the Blue". "Lady Blue" was filmed <a href="Location%20shooting">on location</a> in various areas of Chicago, including the <a href="Cabrini%E2%80%93Green%20Homes">Cabrini–Green Homes</a>. Rose recalled having a difficult time in Cabrini Green since the residents threatened the cast and crew and threw bottles at them during filming.

Mahoney was Rose's first role after playing <a href="Vickie%20Gioberti">Vickie Gioberti</a> in the <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> "<a href="Falcon%20Crest">Falcon Crest</a>"; Reesman wrote that the decision to cast Rose in "Lady Blue" was a surprise, since she was primarily known for appearing as a child with <a href="Bugs%20Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a> in a <a href="Kool-Aid">Kool-Aid</a> commercial. According to Reesman, Mahoney's "steely nerve and conservative stance on crime" contrasted with Rose's "more upbeat, fun-loving, liberal persona". Rose said that she was drawn to the show's genre: "Action shows are so fun because I got to be strapped to things, hoisted over things, shoot the gun, and jump on moving cars. It was like doing a western." According to the "<a href="Orange%20County%20Register">Orange County Register</a>", Mahoney is one of the actress' best-known roles.

To prepare for "Lady Blue", Rose watched Clint Eastwood films (including the <a href="Dirty%20Harry%20%28film%20series%29">"Dirty Harry"</a> franchise) and practiced steadying her gun hand. She had worked with Eastwood in the 1984 film <a href="Tightrope%20%28film%29">"Tightrope"</a> and a portion of the <a href="anthology%20series">anthology series</a> "<a href="Amazing%20Stories%20%28TV%20series%29">Amazing Stories</a>," and received advice on how to mimic using a gun from Eastwood. In addition to Eastwood's assistance, Rose practiced gun-handling at a Chicago <a href="shooting%20range">shooting range</a>. Although Rose described her role as "physically demanding", she said she was not attempting <a href="method%20acting">method acting</a> and relied on <a href="stunt%20double">stunt double</a>s during filming. Rose resisted comparisons to "Dirty Harry", and said: "It's still going to be a lot different because I'm a woman and I can show lots more emotions than Mr. Eastwood."

According to Jamie Rose, "Lady Blue" had a similar concept as the crime dramas <a href="Police%20Woman%20%28TV%20series%29">"Police Woman"</a> and "<a href="Get%20Christie%20Love%21">Get Christie Love!</a>"; Reesman stated that the latter was not as violent as "Lady Blue". John J. O'Connor compared the series' violence to Eastwood's work, and saw it as a combination of <a href="Wonder%20Woman">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href="Dick%20Tracy">Dick Tracy</a> <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a>s. In the 2011 book "Triumph of the Walking Dead: Robert Kirkman's Zombie Epic on Page and Screen", <a href="horror%20fiction">horror fiction</a> writer Vince A. Liaguno described "Lady Blue" and "<a href="NYPD%20Blue">NYPD Blue</a>" as part of a movement towards "grittier depictions of violence". In a 2017 interview, Rose said that "Lady Blue" was the most violent series of its time and there had been little public exposure to a character as "bloodthirsty" as Mahoney; however, she said that the series was less graphic than future television programs.

Thirteen episodes of "Lady Blue" were broadcast on ABC between September 15, 1985 and January 25, 1986. The pilot episode was aired as a <a href="television%20film">television film</a> on April 15, 1985, before it was aired as part of the series in September of that year. According to Lee Margulies of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", the pilot film received high ratings. When the series began, its emphasis on violence was criticized and it was included on <a href="watchdog%20organization">watchdog organization</a> lists. 18 characters were killed in the pilot, and producers had promised future episodes would feature more deaths. The National Coalition on Television Violence called it the "most violent program" on television during the series' run. In response to the criticism, Rose said that "Lady Blue" was set in "more of the heroic fantasy world" and compared Mahoney to a <a href="superhero">superhero</a>; she explained that series was not intended to be a realistic representation of the police.

"Lady Blue" was initially broadcast on Thursday nights at 8 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a>; the series ranked third in its time slot, behind the half-hour <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a>s "<a href="Cheers">Cheers</a>" and "<a href="Night%20Court">Night Court</a>" and the detective series "<a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Simon">Simon & Simon</a>". After seven episodes aired, it was moved to Thursday nights at 9 pm EST to accommodate "<a href="The%20Colbys">The Colbys</a>". ABC announced that it ordered a <a href="Limited-run%20series">limited</a> number of episodes of "Lady Blue" in its new time, but the series would be moved to another day "without interrupting the weekly flow" if it was successful. The series was later moved to Saturday nights at 9 pm EST, when it aired against "<a href="The%20Golden%20Girls">The Golden Girls</a>" and continued to receive complaints of excessive violence.

ABC cancelled "Lady Blue" in 1986. Reesman also attributed the decision to low ratings. After the end of the series, Rose said: "It was still a great experience. You don't get much opportunity to star in your own series, especially if you're a woman." "Lady Blue" was rebroadcast on <a href="Lifetime%20%28TV%20network%29">Lifetime</a>, following the network's tradition of airing shows depicting female characters in traditionally-male occupations; other examples include female private detectives in "<a href="Veronica%20Clare">Veronica Clare</a>" and "<a href="Partners%20in%20Crime%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Partners in Crime</a>" and a female physician in "<a href="Kay%20O%27Brien">Kay O'Brien</a>". The series has not been released on DVD, Blu-ray or an online-streaming service. <a href="Metro-Goldwyn%20Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn Mayer</a> owns the rights to "Lady Blue", but a studio spokesperson said that there were no plans for a home release.

During its run, "Lady Blue" received primarily negative reviews due to its emphasis on violence. Although O'Connor criticized the series for its "mindless violence and questionable law enforcement", Anderson felt that the show had potential: "Perhaps, with a little more seasoning on the Chicago police department, Jamie Rose might become a star." In his 1991 book "The TV Encyclopedia", David Inman called "Lady Blue" "one of the dumbest shows ever on ABC--and that's saying a lot". Lloyd Grove of "The Washington Post" criticized the reliance on violence "overpowers, and eventually sours, what could have been an agreeably fast-paced show". In response to the pilot, Grove also panned its writer Robert Vincent O'Neil for copying ideas from Clint Eastwood films and the 1971 movie <a href="The%20French%20Connection%20%28film%29">"The French Connection"</a>. Despite negative reviews, Reesman reported that teenage and young adult males responded positively to Mahoney's attitude and appearance.

In his 2013 book "June Cleaver Was a Feminist!: Reconsidering the Female Characters of Early Television", <a href="television%20studies">television studies</a> author Cary O'Dell called "Lady Blue" an "interesting experiment" in imagining the "hardcore cop genre with a female lead". According to O'Dell, criticism of Mahoney and the series' ultimate cancellation were the results of sexism: "Was such rebellion, contempt for authority, and brutal tactics considered too 'unfeminine'?" The author felt that "Lady Blue" was ahead of its time, contrasting Mahoney's negative reception with the positive reaction to the titular protagonists of the 1991 film "<a href="Thelma%20%26amp%3B%20Louise">Thelma & Louise</a>", who have developed a legacy as "newfangled feminist icons".

Analytical Review

The Analytical Review was an English periodical that was published from 1788 to 1798, having been established in <a href="London">London</a> by the publisher <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a> and the writer <a href="Thomas%20Christie">Thomas Christie</a>. Part of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Letters">Republic of Letters</a>, it was a <a href="wikt%3Agadfly">gadfly</a> publication, which offered readers summaries and analyses of the many new publications issued at the end of the eighteenth century.

Perhaps most important, the "Analytical Review" provided a forum for <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">radical</a> political and religious ideas. Although it aimed at impartiality, its articles were often critical of the British government and supportive of the <a href="French%20revolution">French revolution</a>aries. While the journal had low circulation numbers for its day, it still influenced popular opinion and was feared by the conservative government of <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">William Pitt the Younger</a>. In late 1797, the "<a href="Anti-Jacobin">Anti-Jacobin</a>", the self-styled nemesis of the "Analytical Review", was founded by supporters of the government and other reactionary interests; it criticized the radical politics of the "Analytical" and monitored it for unpatriotic and irreligious sentiments.

Organized into separate departments, each with its own chief reviewer, the "Analytical Review" focused on politics, philosophy, natural history, and literature. To promote a disinterested air, its reviewers were anonymous, signing their work with <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>ous initials. Nevertheless, the journal recruited several prominent writers, such as the poet <a href="William%20Cowper">William Cowper</a>, the moralist <a href="William%20Enfield">William Enfield</a>, the physician <a href="John%20Aikin">John Aikin</a> and the polemicist <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>.

The "Analytical Review" suspended publication in December 1798 after the deaths of Christie (1796) and Wollstonecraft (1797), the conviction of Johnson for <a href="seditious%20libel">seditious libel</a> (1798) and the retirement of other contributing editors.

The <a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a> "<a href="Monthly%20Review%20%28London%29">Monthly Review</a>", founded in 1749 by <a href="Ralph%20Griffiths">Ralph Griffiths</a>, and the <a href="Tories%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tory</a> "<a href="The%20Critical%20Review">Critical Review</a>", founded in 1756 by <a href="Tobias%20Smollett">Tobias Smollett</a>, were the first journals dedicated to reviewing books in Britain. Although they were joined by smaller publications such as the "Analytical Review", these two journals dominated reviewing in the second half of the eighteenth century. They focused on poetry, novels, drama, <a href="belles-lettres">belles-lettres</a>, <a href="travel%20literature">travel literature</a>, biographies, science writing and other forms of popular literature. They did not review many complex theological or scholarly works, particularly those in foreign languages.

Just prior to the founding of the "Analytical Review", two periodicals with similar aims had collapsed. The first was the "<a href="Theological%20Repository">Theological Repository</a>" (1770–73; 1784–88), whose driving force was <a href="English%20Dissenters">Dissenting</a> theologian, clergyman, and scientist <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a>. Its articles were intended to be rigorously analytical and attempted to "settl[e] the [Biblical] text by a comparison of various readings; by accurate translation, division, and punctuation; by a concise, well-digested commentary; by notes philosophical and explanatory; and finally by adding doctrinal and moral conclusions". Sold by <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a> at a low price to encourage a wide readership, the "Repository" was open to all opinions, provided that they were expressed courteously: "In this Repository not only will room be given to the freest objections to natural or revealed religion, but they are sincerely requested; and nothing that is new will be rejected, if it be expressed in decent terms". Although the "Theological Repository" was a financial liability for Johnson by 1771, he continued to publish it until 1773 and helped Priestley renew its publication in 1784.

A second forerunner of the "Analytical Review" was <a href="Paul%20Henry%20Maty">Paul Henry Maty</a>'s periodical "A New Review" (published 1782–86), which was likewise devoted to reviewing books and offering a summary of their contents. Like its successor, the "New Review" paid special attention to foreign literature and took a leading role in introducing German literature to the British public.

The demises of the "Theological Repository" and the "New Review" left a publishing vacuum; the arrival in London of the author <a href="Thomas%20Christie">Thomas Christie</a>, who was dedicated to starting a new periodical that would replace and perhaps even improve upon these precursors, was the primary impetus in the creation of the "Analytical Review". Johnson and Christie were mutual friends of Priestley and others, and their combined interest in beginning such a journal resulted in the foundation of the "Analytical Review".

Johnson and Christie's prospectus describes its reviewers as "the HISTORIANS of the Republic of Letters" [emphasis in original]. Literary scholar Paul Keen has described the <a href="Republic%20of%20Letters">Republic of Letters</a> as a vision of society in which "all rational individuals could have their say, and in which an increasingly enlightened reading public would be able to judge the merit of different arguments for themselves". The practical goal of the "Analytical Review" was to facilitate this society by summarizing serious new and foreign publications in great depth so that intelligent readers might form their own opinions. This aim was embodied in its initial title: "The Analytical Review; or, History of Literature, domestic and foreign, on an enlarged plan. Containing Scientific Abstracts of important and interesting Works, published in English; a general account of such as are of less consequence, with short characters; Notices, or Reviews of valuable foreign Books; Criticism on New pieces of Music and Works of Art; and the Literary Intelligence of Europe, etc." The periodical sought to avoid ephemeral works and to review only "standard works which add to the stock of human knowledge and will live beyond a day". Johnson and Christie also intended to eschew editorializing and to avoid shaping the tastes of the public. Scrupulous attention to this point was meant to bring the "reviewed work" into the foreground and not the "reviewer" (a goal shared by many eighteenth-century journals). An early review, for example, criticized historian <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a> for "so frequently and unnecessarily obtruding his particular prejudices on the eye of his readers". All editors signed their reviews with initials (sometimes not their own) rather than with their names. This practice was meant to prevent the appearance of collusion between the reviewers and the authors reviewed, although this did not succeed in practice. It was also intended to prevent any unethical puffing, or false advertising, of friends' or one's own books; nevertheless, both <a href="Henry%20Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</a> and <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> reviewed their own books for the journal.

In repackaging other publications for its readers, the "Analytical Review" participated in the encyclopedic movement of the eighteenth century, a movement largely begun by <a href="Denis%20Diderot">Denis Diderot</a> and <a href="Jean%20le%20Rond%20d%27Alembert">Jean le Rond d'Alembert's</a> "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A9die">Encyclopédie</a>". Excited and yet overwhelmed by what they viewed as a dramatic increase in human knowledge, encyclopedists of the era aimed to organize and classify all of this new knowledge using a new reference system: the encyclopedia. The "Analytical Review" was part of this project and its editors believed that they were preserving the knowledge of the past and the present for the future. The journal was, according to scholar Nathaniel Teich, "the most important radical review adopting the encyclopedic format for the attempted universal coverage of published works". Yet, the editors also recognized the ultimate futility of such a project.

The "Analytical Review" was meant to enlighten the public as well as to simplify communication between authors separated by great distances; most importantly, the debates between those authors could be read by the public. In granting authors a public forum in which to communicate, periodicals such as the "Analytical" helped to define authorship—they encouraged the professionalization of writing and granted prestige to writers and journalists.

Unusual for its time, the "Analytical Review" brought current foreign-language publications, particularly those with a scientific, philosophical, or aesthetic bent, to its readers' attention. For example, it approvingly reviewed <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Friedrich Schiller's</a> "Fiesco" (published by Johnson) and argued that more of the author's works should be translated. The "Analytical" also emphasized the emerging middle-class <a href="Protestant%20work%20ethic">Protestant work ethic</a>, specifically tying it to scientific knowledge. One issue celebrated successful British merchants, calling them "the most liberal and enlightened men that have appeared in Europe" because of their "love of science" and their "patronage of learned men".

Johnson and Christie set up separate departments for practical sciences, such as mathematics, natural history, agriculture, and medicine; literature, such as poetry, drama, and romance; and finally, politics and religion, which encompassed government, theology, philosophy, morality, law, and trade. For each department, there was a chief reviewer, although he or she might engage others. Although the reviewers' names were not known to the public, Johnson and Christie managed to acquire several luminaries: the poet <a href="William%20Cowper">William Cowper</a>; the popular moralist <a href="William%20Enfield">William Enfield</a>; the writer and physician <a href="John%20Aikin">John Aikin</a>; the poet, essayist, and children's author <a href="Anna%20Laetitia%20Barbauld">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</a>; the <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> minister <a href="William%20Turner%20%28Unitarian%20minister%29">William Turner</a>; the physician and literary critic <a href="James%20Currie%20%28physician%29">James Currie</a>; the artist Henry Fuseli; the writer <a href="Mary%20Hays">Mary Hays</a>; the scholar <a href="Alexander%20Geddes">Alexander Geddes</a>; and the theologian <a href="Joshua%20Toulmin">Joshua Toulmin</a>. The reviewers were all paid, however scholars have been unable to discover their rates. Christie was often absent after the founding of the "Analytical Review", leaving the day-to-day operations of the journal up to Johnson. In 1790 he went to Paris for six months, during which he met with revolutionary leaders and started a business; in 1792 he returned to help the French translate their constitution and to dissolve his business. He left for <a href="Surinam">Surinam</a> in 1796 to collect money owed to him, and died there.

The first issue of the "Analytical Review" was dated May 1788 and the last issue was dated December 1798. The issues were published monthly and averaged 128 pages. They were also collected into volumes, which consisted of four monthly issues and an appendix (volumes 21–28 switched to a semi-annual publication run without appendices). Each issue contained an extensive table of contents, several major reviews of 10 to 20 pages (sometimes extending to a second issue), many minor reviews, and a "catalogue of books and pamphlets published" during the previous six months.

Compared with other major periodicals of its day, the "Analytical Review" had a low circulation. While both the Tory "Critical Review" and the "<a href="British%20Critic">British Critic</a>" had a circulation of 3,500 by 1797 and the "Monthly Review" realized 5,000, Johnson and Christie's journal only ever achieved about 1,500. However, it was common practice during the eighteenth century for an individual copy of each publication to be read by many different people. Scholars have estimated that each copy of a London newspaper, for example, was read by thirty people; <a href="coffeehouse">coffeehouse</a>s and taverns were well-stocked with copies of newspapers and journals, as were <a href="circulating%20library">circulating libraries</a>. Hence, circulation numbers offer only a small glimpse into how many people actually read such publications.

Beginning with the "Analytical Review"'s third issue, Mary Wollstonecraft became the key editor for dramas, romances, and novels. Scholars have speculated that her reviews are signed by the letters "M", "W", or "T", corresponding roughly to her initials, in large part because they have identified her writing style in these pieces. Her reviews, which number over 200, are generally characterized by their concern for women's issues. Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers concludes that Wollstonecraft "is not only a pioneer feminist, but also a pioneer feminist critic, whose analysis of the mesh between gender and genre inaugurates the feminist critical project". Wollstonecraft wrote excoriating reviews, criticizing the passive novelistic heroines of the time and praising, for example, the "wise and resilient" Mrs Stafford of <a href="Charlotte%20Turner%20Smith">Charlotte Smith's</a> autobiographical novel "<a href="Emmeline">Emmeline</a>" (1788). In highlighting this character, she "singles out ... the knowledgeable mother figure who has felt and thought deeply", one who resembles the women she described in "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792) as having "power ... over themselves". She derides the "derivative, prescriptive, imitative, and affected" and celebrates the "natural, innovative, [and] imaginative". Evincing a particular regard for the works of <a href="Thomas%20Holcroft">Thomas Holcroft</a>, such as "<a href="Anna%20St.%20Ives">Anna St. Ives</a>" (1792), Wollstonecraft celebrated their championing of innate nobility and virtue over aristocratic titles. <a href="Romanticism">Romanticist</a> Anne Chandler argues that Wollstonecraft's reviews demonstrate "an earlier <a href="Augustan%20literature">Augustan</a> politics of knowledge, variously outlined by <a href="John%20Dryden">Dryden</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Pope</a>, and, to a lesser extent, <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Swift</a>" which "may be seen in her insistence on a continuum between aesthetic integrity and civic virtue; her belief in a metaphysical dialogue between human wit and divine Nature; and her perception of belletristic criticism as the proper tribunal for a new onslaught of scholarly and scientific research". While writing her last novel, "" (1798), Wollstonecraft took advantage of her position with Johnson and reviewed almost nothing but novels, exposing herself to the wide variety of novelistic forms.

The other reviewers have been the focus of far less scholarship. According to Eudo Mason, "Fuseli's peculiar style, his favourite phrases and quotations, themes and ideas make it possible to determine his authorship beyond reasonable doubt in most cases". He signed reviews "Z.Z." and "R.R." (of which there are about 40), initials which appear throughout the run of the journal. He also occasionally signed reviews "Y.Y.", "U.U.", "V.V.", and "L.L." (although this last was used by another reviewer as well). In total, Mason counts 66 reviews, 56 of which he is certain. Fuseli made it a practice to review texts which mentioned him, works written by friends he wanted to assist with flattering reviews, artistic works, and German literature (in particular those written by <a href="Johann%20Gottfried%20Herder">Johann Gottfried Herder</a>).

Geddes, who contributed from the first issue, wrote forty-six articles, almost all on topics of biblical criticism or ecclesiastical history. However, he left the "Analytical" in September 1793 to edit for the "Monthly Review". Cowper, who probably submitted articles under the initials P.P. and G.G., predominantly reviewed poetry.

The "Analytical Review" offered its readers access to a wide variety of works. In July 1789, when the <a href="Fall%20of%20the%20Bastille">Bastille fell</a>, the "Analytical" reviewed "The Rural Economy of Gloucestershire", "Life of Thomas Chatterton", "Transactions in Bengal", "Military Operations on the Coromandel Coast", "Poetry and Music of the Italian Opera", and "Histoire Politique de la Revolution en France". The journal also laid provocative facts before the public to prompt them to think and, if necessary, to take action, although it claimed not to advocate one viewpoint over another. For example, when philosopher and statesman <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a> issued his politically controversial "<a href="Reflections%20on%20the%20Revolution%20in%20France">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a>" (1790), the "Analytical Review" reviewed it extensively, as well as the many responses to it, such as Wollstonecraft's "<a href="Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">Vindication of the Rights of Men</a>" (1790), "<a href="Vindiciae%20Gallicae">Vindiciae Gallicae</a>" (1791) by <a href="James%20Mackintosh">James Mackintosh</a>, and "<a href="Rights%20of%20Man">Rights of Man</a>" (1791) by <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a>. However, the majority of the excerpts that the reviewers chose to publish came from the rebuttals to Burke's work.

Consistent with Joseph Johnson's attitudes, the "Analytical Review" tended towards a "moderate radicalism", meaning that it opposed the <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">Pitt</a> administration and celebrated the general values of Paine's "Rights of Man". It advocated a moderate reform of <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Parliament</a>, emphasized the benefits of representative government, and outlined the protections afforded by a <a href="separation%20of%20powers">separation of powers</a>. While the journal supported the ideals of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and opposed <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">Britain's war against France</a>, it did not endorse the violent methods of some of the revolutionaries. Johnson continued his attempts to remain even-handed in political debates, arguing that <a href="political%20faction">factionalism</a> in government was detrimental.

Helen Braithwaite, in her book on Johnson, argues that "by July 1798 ... the "Analytical" had become a deep thorn in the side of the government"; at Johnson's trial for <a href="seditious%20libel">seditious libel</a>, an issue of the periodical was entered as evidence against him, demonstrating that the government did not view the journal as non-partisan. Derek Roper, in his survey of late-eighteenth-century periodicals, describes the "Analytical" as "more radical both in politics and in religion than any other journal". As he explains, however, "these sentiments were not always fully explicit, and might be conveyed through the tone and manner of a summary rather than paragraphs of criticism".

Many of the founding members of the "Analytical Review" were Unitarian and quite a few of its contributors were Dissenters, so contemporaries believed there to be a bias in the journal (most eighteenth-century journals were overtly partisan). Christie attempted to assuage these fears in his advertisement:

This sincere attitude seems to have largely prevailed in practice. <a href="Theophilus%20Lindsey">Theophilus Lindsey</a>, who had helped establish Unitarianism in Britain, wrote to the Reverend <a href="Newcome%20Cappe">Newcome Cappe</a> to express his displeasure at a review in the first issue of the "Analytical", demonstrating that Unitarian theology was not being promulgated by the journal. Furthermore, Johnson chose as his theological reviewer, not a Dissenter as his friend Joseph Priestley urged, but Alexander Geddes, a talented Scot who had been ordained in Paris as a <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholic</a> priest. However, modern scholars have suggested that he did so not for religious reasons, but because Geddes lived in London and had close connections both to Wollstonecraft and Johnson's friend, Henry Fuseli.

The self-styled nemesis of the "Analytical Review" was "The Anti-Jacobin; or, Weekly Examiner" (later retitled "<a href="Anti-Jacobin%20Review">The Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine</a>"), a loyalist periodical begun in November 1797 by the writer <a href="William%20Gifford">William Gifford</a> at the suggestion of the politician <a href="George%20Canning">George Canning</a>, and with the tacit encouragement of the administration of William Pitt. The chief editor and writer was <a href="John%20Richards%20Green">John Richards Green</a> (writing under the pseudonym "John Gifford") together with Andrew Bisset. In its prospectus, the "Anti-Jacobin Review" announced:

The editors therefore decided to "counteract the pernicious effects of this dangerous SYSTEM" [emphasis in original] and to "restore criticism to its original standard"—they would "frequently "review" the "Monthly", "criticise" the "Critical", and "analyse" the "Analytical Reviews" " [emphasis in original]. The "Anti-Jacobin Review" published a regular feature, "The Reviewers Reviewed", which analyzed the "<a href="Jacobin%20%28politics%29">Jacobin</a>" reviews for politically unacceptable statements and images. The "Anti-Jacobin Review" also attacked the "Analytical Review" for its perceived atheism and for what they deemed its lack of patriotism.

During Johnson's 1798 trial for seditious libel for publishing a pamphlet by <a href="Gilbert%20Wakefield">Gilbert Wakefield</a>, they wrote:
The "Anti-Jacobin" also published parodies of the works of liberal poets; most famously, "Loves of the Triangles" mocked <a href="Erasmus%20Darwin">Erasmus Darwin's</a> "<a href="The%20Botanic%20Garden">Loves of the Plants</a>" (1791).

After Johnson was convicted on 17 July 1798, and before he was sentenced on 12 February 1799, he tried to prove that he had "uniformly recommended the circulation of such publications as had a tendency to promote good morals instead of such as were calculated to mislead and inflame the Common people". Periodical scholar Stuart Andrews therefore argues that the last issues of the "Analytical Review" "must be read in the light of Johnson's impending sentence". The June 1798 issue focused on travel literature and female fashions, and although it reviewed Mary Hays's "Appeal to the Men of Great Britain on Behalf of Women", it did not do so with any "political bite". In the same months that the "Anti-Jacobin Review" launched its first critiques of the "Analytical" and other journals, the "Analytical" published extensive articles on the <a href="picturesque">picturesque</a> and other aesthetic theories.

The editors of the "Anti-Jacobin Review" took credit for the "dissolution" of the "Analytical Review" in the preface to their bound 1798 volume, writing: "The other object of our immediate attacks, the "Analytical Review", has received its death-blow, and we have more reason to congratulate ourselves upon the share which we have had in producing its dissolution, than it would be expedient here to unfold." They also published a cartoon by <a href="Thomas%20Rowlandson">Thomas Rowlandson</a> entitled "A Charm for a Democracy, Reviewed, Analysed, & Destroyed". However, scholars attribute the end of Johnson and Christie's journal to Johnson's trial for seditious libel and the ensuing negative publicity, in addition to the deaths of Christie and Wollstonecraft in 1796 and 1797 respectively.

After its suspension with the December 1798 issue, the "Analytical Review" lay dormant until it was briefly revived as "The Analytical Review (New Series)" during the first six months of 1799. It was printed and sold by T. Hurst of Paternoster Row, apparently without any connection to Johnson or the prior reviewers. Unlike its predecessor, the new series was cautious; it reviewed relatively uncontroversial works and its articles did not have initialled signatures. This series lasted only from January until June 1799.

Butler writes that "one marker of the end of the bourgeois republic of letters was the jailing in 1798 of the doyen of publisher-booksellers, Joseph Johnson". Moreover, she explains that the seeming ideological "coherence" of the Republic of Letters, as it was represented in late-eighteenth-century British journals, was eliminated with the founding of the <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> "British Critic" in 1792 and the establishment of the "<a href="Edinburgh%20Review">Edinburgh Review</a>" in 1802. The "Edinburgh", according to Butler, "plainly set out to break the mould of existing journal culture". Rather than attempting to cover a wide variety of texts, as had the "Analytical Review" and its cohorts, it focused on only a few texts and restricted itself to subject areas that the editors deemed worthwhile. For example, it emphasized academic fields for which Scottish universities were well-known, such as the natural sciences, moral philosophy, and political economy. Radical political writings, classical studies, clerical writings, and popular literature were either excluded or ridiculed.

Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark

Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (<a href="1796%20in%20literature">1796</a>) is a personal <a href="travel%20literature">travel narrative</a> by the eighteenth-century British <a href="18th-century%20feminism">feminist</a> writer <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>. The twenty-five letters cover a wide range of topics, from sociological reflections on <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity. Published by Wollstonecraft's career-long publisher, <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a>, it was the last work issued during her lifetime.

Wollstonecraft undertook her tour of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark in order to retrieve a stolen treasure ship for her lover, <a href="Gilbert%20Imlay">Gilbert Imlay</a>. Believing that the journey would restore their strained relationship, she eagerly set off. However, over the course of the three months she spent in Scandinavia, she realized that Imlay had no intention of renewing the relationship. The letters, which constitute the text, drawn from her journal and from missives she sent to Imlay, reflect her anger and melancholy over his repeated betrayals. "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" is therefore both a travel narrative and an autobiographical <a href="memoir">memoir</a>.

Using the rhetoric of the <a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a>, Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between self and society in the text. She values subjective experience, particularly in relation to nature; champions the liberation and education of women; and illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society.

"Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" was Wollstonecraft's most popular book in the 1790s—it sold well and was reviewed favorably by most critics. Wollstonecraft's future husband, philosopher <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, wrote: "If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book." It influenced <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> poets such as <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>, who drew on its themes and its aesthetic. While the book initially inspired readers to travel to Scandinavia, it failed to retain its popularity after the publication of Godwin's "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" in 1798, which revealed Wollstonecraft's unorthodox private life.

In 1790, at the age of thirty-one, Wollstonecraft made a dramatic entrance onto the public stage with "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</a>", a work that helped propel the <a href="Revolution%20Controversy">British pamphlet war over the French revolution</a>. Two years later she published what has become her most famous work, "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>". Anxious to see the revolution firsthand, she moved to France for about two years, but returned in 1795 after revolutionary violence increased and the lover she met there, American adventurer <a href="Gilbert%20Imlay">Gilbert Imlay</a>, abandoned her and their <a href="illegitimacy">illegitimate</a> daughter, <a href="Fanny%20Imlay">Fanny Imlay</a>. Shortly after her return to Britain, Wollstonecraft attempted suicide in May; Imlay, however, managed to save her.

One month after her attempted suicide, Wollstonecraft agreed to undertake the long and treacherous journey to Scandinavia in order to resolve Imlay's business difficulties. Not only was her journey to Scandinavia fraught with peril (she was a woman travelling alone during <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">a time of war</a>), it was also laced with sorrow and anger. While Wollstonecraft initially believed that the trip might resurrect their relationship, she eventually recognized that it was doomed, particularly after Imlay failed to meet her in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. Wollstonecraft's despair increased as her journey progressed.

On her return to Britain in September, Wollstonecraft tried to commit suicide a second time: she attempted to drown herself in the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> but was rescued by passersby. "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark", which draws its material from her journal and the letters she sent Imlay during the three-month tour, was published in by Wollstonecraft's close friend and career-long publisher, <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a>. Written after her two suicide attempts, "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" frequently returns to the topic of death; it recreates Wollstonecraft's mental state while she was in Scandinavia and has been described as a suicide note addressed to Imlay, although he is never referred to by name in the published text. It is the last work by Wollstonecraft published within her lifetime: she died in childbirth just one year later.

Although Wollstonecraft appears as only a tourist in "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark", during her travels she was actually conducting delicate business negotiations on behalf of Imlay. For almost two hundred years, it was unclear why she had travelled to Scandinavia, but in the 1980s historian <a href="Per%20Nystr%C3%B6m">Per Nyström</a> uncovered documents in local Swedish and Norwegian archives that shed light on the purpose of her trip. He revealed that Wollstonecraft was searching for a ship and cargo that had been stolen from Imlay. Imlay had authorized her to conduct his business dealings, referring to her in legal documents as "Mrs. Mary Imlay, my best friend and wife", although the two were not married.
The intricate details of Imlay's business dealings are laid out clearly by Nyström. On 1794, Peder Ellefsen, who belonged to a rich and influential Norwegian family, bought a ship called the "Liberty" from agents of Imlay in <a href="Le%20Havre%2C%20France">Le Havre, France</a>. It would later become clear that Ellefsen never owned the ship but rather engaged in a <a href="Pro%20forma">pro-forma</a> sale on behalf of Imlay. He renamed the ship the "Maria and Margaretha" (presumably after Mary and her maid Marguerite) and had the Danish Consulate in Le Havre certify it so that the ship could pass through the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">British blockade of France</a> (Imlay was a <a href="blockade%20runner">blockade runner</a>). Carrying silver and gold Bourbon plate, the ship sailed from France under a Danish flag and arrived at <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> on 1794. Although Ellefsen supposedly ordered the ship to continue on to <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, it never reached its destination. Imlay engaged in several fruitless attempts to locate the ship and its valuable cargo and then dispatched Wollstonecraft to negotiate an agreement with Ellefsen, who had subsequently been arrested for stealing the ship and its contents. Wollstonecraft's success or failure in the negotiations is unknown as is the ultimate fate of the ship and its treasure.

To engage in these negotiations, Wollstonecraft travelled first to Gothenburg, where she remained for two weeks. Leaving Fanny and her nurse Marguerite behind, she embarked for <a href="Str%C3%B6mstad">Strömstad</a>, Sweden, where she took a short detour to visit the <a href="Fredriksten">fortress of Fredriksten</a>, and then proceeded to <a href="Larvik">Larvik</a>, Norway. From there she travelled to <a href="T%C3%B8nsberg">Tønsberg</a>, Norway, where she spent three weeks. She also visited <a href="Helgeroa">Helgeroa</a>, <a href="Ris%C3%B8r%20%28town%29">Risør</a>, and <a href="Oslo">Kristiania</a> (now Oslo) and returned by way of Strömstad and Gothenburg, where she picked up Fanny and Marguerite again. She returned to England by way of Copenhagen and Hamburg, finally landing at <a href="Dover">Dover</a> in September 1795, three months after she had left her home country.

"Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" consists of twenty-five letters that address an extensive range of contentious political topics, such as prison reform, land rights, and divorce laws, as well as less controversial subjects, such as gardening, <a href="History%20of%20salt">salt works</a>, and <a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> vistas. Wollstonecraft's political commentary extends the ideas she had presented in "An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution" (1794); her discussion of prison reform, for example, is informed by her own experiences in <a href="French%20revolution">revolutionary France</a> and those of her friends, many of whom were jailed.

While at first glance "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" appears to be a <a href="travel%20literature">travel narrative</a>, it is actually a "generic hybrid". The nature of this hybridity, however, is not altogether agreed upon by scholars. Some emphasize Wollstonecraft's fusion of the travelogue with the <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> or <a href="memoir">memoir</a> (a word used by Wollstonecraft in the book's advertisement), while others see it as a travelogue "cum" <a href="epistolary%20novel">epistolary novel</a>. The text, which reveals Wollstonecraft's thought processes, flows seamlessly from autobiographical reflections to musings on nature to political theories. However, it is unified by two threads: the first is Wollstonecraft's argument regarding the nature and progress of society; the second is her increasing melancholy. Although Wollstonecraft aims to write as a philosopher, the image of the suffering woman dominates the book.

One-half of the "generic hybridity" of "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" is the epistolary travel narrative. Wollstonecraft's conception of this genre was shaped by eighteenth-century empirical and moral travel narratives, particularly <a href="Oliver%20Goldsmith">Oliver Goldsmith's</a> "<a href="The%20Traveller%20%28poem%29">The Traveller, or a Prospect of Society</a>" (1764), <a href="Laurence%20Sterne">Laurence Sterne's</a> "<a href="A%20Sentimental%20Journey%20Through%20France%20and%20Italy">A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy</a>" (1768), <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson's</a> "<a href="A%20Journey%20to%20the%20Western%20Islands%20of%20Scotland">A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland</a>" (1775), <a href="James%20Boswell">James Boswell's</a> "<a href="The%20Journal%20of%20a%20Tour%20to%20the%20Hebrides">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</a>" (1785), and <a href="Arthur%20Young%20%28writer%29">Arthur Young's</a> travel books.

After reviewing twenty-four travel books for <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson's</a> periodical, the "<a href="Analytical%20Review">Analytical Review</a>", Wollstonecraft was well-versed in the genre. This extensive reading solidified her ideas of what constituted a good travel book; in one review, she maintained that travel writers should have "some decided point in view, a grand object of pursuit to concentrate their thoughts, and connect their reflections" and that their books should not be "detached observations, which no running interest, or prevailing bent in the mind of the writer rounds into a whole". Her reviews praised detailed and engaging descriptions of people and places, musings on history, and an insatiable curiosity in the traveller.

"The art of travel is only a branch of the art of thinking", Wollstonecraft wrote. Her journey and her comments on it are, therefore, not only sentimental but also philosophical. She uses the two modes to continue the critique of the roles afforded women and the progress of civilization that she had outlined in "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</a>" (1790), "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792), and "An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution". After overturning the conventions of political and historical writing, Wollstonecraft brought what scholar Gary Kelly calls "Revolutionary feminism" to yet another genre that had typically been considered the purview of male writers, transforming the travel narrative's "blend of objective facts and individual impressions ... into a rationale for autobiographical revelation". As one editor of the "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" writes, the book is "nothing less than a revolution in literary genres"; its sublimity, expressed through scenes of intense feeling, made "a new wildness and richness of emotional rhetoric" desirable in travel literature.

One scholar has called Wollstonecraft the "complete passionate traveler". Her desire to delve into and fully experience each moment in time was fostered by the works of <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, particularly his "<a href="Reveries%20of%20a%20Solitary%20Walker">Reveries of a Solitary Walker</a>" (1782). Several of Rousseau's themes appear in the "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark", such as "the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding". However, while Rousseau ultimately rejects society, Wollstonecraft celebrates both domesticity and industrial progress.

In one of the most influential interpretations of "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark", <a href="Mary%20Favret">Mary Favret</a> has argued that Wollstonecraft's letters must not only be viewed as personal correspondence but also as business correspondence, a genre that would have been ideologically ambiguous for her. According to Favret, Wollstonecraft attempts to reclaim the impersonal genre of the business letter and imbue it with personal meaning. One way she does this is through extensive use of "imaginative" writing that forces the reader to become a participant in the events narrated.

Favret points out that Wollstonecraft's "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" is quite different from the despondent and plaintive love letters she actually sent to Imlay; the travel narrative much more closely resembles the personal journal in which she recorded her thoughts regarding the people she encountered and the places she visited. While her letters to Imlay contain long passages focused almost exclusively on herself, the "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" offers social commentary and sympathizes with the victims of disaster and injustice. To Imlay, Wollstonecraft represents herself as laid low by doubts, but to the world she depicts herself as overcoming all of these fears. She ruminates on them and transforms them into the basis of a letter akin to the open political letter popular during the last quarter of the eighteenth century, using her personal experience as the foundation for a discussion of national political reform.

Heavily influenced by Rousseau's frank and revealing "<a href="Confessions%20of%20Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Confessions</a>" (1782), Wollstonecraft lays bare her soul in "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark", detailing not only her physical but also her psychological journey. Her personal disclosures, like those of other female autobiographers, are presented as "unpremeditated self-revelations" and often appear to be "circuitous". However, as Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers has made clear, Wollstonecraft manages to use this style of writing to articulate a stable and comprehensible self for the reader. Increasingly confident in her ability as a writer, she controls the narrative and its effect on readers to a degree not matched in her other works. She transforms the individual sorrows of her trip, such as the dissolution of her relationship with Imlay, into the stuff of gripping literature.

Wollstonecraft relies extensively on the language of the <a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> in "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark". She draws on and redefines <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke's</a> central terms in "<a href="A%20Philosophical%20Enquiry%20into%20the%20Origin%20of%20Our%20Ideas%20of%20the%20Sublime%20and%20Beautiful">A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</a>" (1757). Burke privileges the sublime (which he associates with masculinity, terror, awe, and strength) over the beautiful (which he associates with femininity, passivity, delicacy, and weakness), while Wollstonecraft ties the sublime to sterility and the beautiful to fertility. For her, the beautiful is connected to the maternal; this aesthetic shift is evident, for example, in the many passages focusing on the affectionate tie between Wollstonecraft and little Fanny, her daughter. She thus claims the feminine category of the "beautiful" for the most virtuous and useful of women: mothers.

Wollstonecraft also revises the conventional negative associations between the sublime and death; thoughts of death, prompted by a waterfall, for example, lead her to contemplate rebirth and immortality as well:

Reaching the cascade, or rather cataract, the roaring of which had a long time announced its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.

Like her other manipulations of the language of the sublime, this passage is also heavily inflected by gender. As one scholar puts it, "because Wollstonecraft is a woman, and is therefore bound by the legal and social restrictions placed on her sex in the eighteenth century, she can only envisage autonomy of any form after death".

Often categorized as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates her commitment to and appreciation of feeling in "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark". She argues that subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark", however, reason serves as a tool for reflection, mediating between the sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason—the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in "<a href="Original%20Stories%20from%20Real%20Life">Original Stories from Real Life</a>" (1788)—but also an understanding of when and how to trust one's emotions.

Wollstonecraft's theories regarding reason, emotion, and the imagination are closely tied together. Some scholars contend that Wollstonecraft uses the imagination to liberate the self, especially the feminine self; it allows her to envision roles for women outside the traditional bounds of eighteenth-century thought and offers her a way to articulate those new ideas. In contrast, others view Wollstonecraft's emphasis on the power of the imagination as detrimental, imprisoning her in an "individualized, bourgeois desire" which can never truly embrace sociality.

<a href="Mary%20Favret">Favret</a> has argued that Wollstonecraft uses the imagination to reconcile "masculine understanding" and "female sensibility". Readers must imaginatively "work" while reading: their efforts will save them from descending into sentimentality as well as from being lured into commercial speculation. Even more importantly, readers become invested in the story of the narrator. Wollstonecraft's language demands that they participate in the "plot":

'they' rescue the writer from the villain; 'they' accompany her on her flight from sorrow ... With the readers' cooperation, the writer reverses the standard epistolary plot: here the heroine liberates herself by rejecting her correspondent and by embracing the 'world' outside of the domestic circle.

In giving the imagination the power to reshape society (a power suggested through numerous allusions to <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare's</a> "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>"), Wollstonecraft reveals that she has become a <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a>.

Throughout "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark", Wollstonecraft ponders the relationship between society and the individual. While her earlier works largely focus on society's failings and responsibilities, in this work she turns inward, explicitly arguing for the value of personal experience. In the advertisement for the work, also published as a preface, she explains her role as the "hero" of the text:

In writing these desultory letters, I found I could not avoid being continually the first person – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.

Throughout the book, Wollstonecraft ties her own psychic journey and maturation to the progress of civilizations. Nations, like individuals, she maintains have, as Wollstonecraft scholar Mary Poovey describes it, "a collective 'understanding' that evolves organically, 'ripening' gradually to fruition". However, Wollstonecraft still views civilization's tragedies as worthier of concern than individual or fictional tragedies, suggesting that, for her, sympathy is at the core of social relations:

I have then considered myself as a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still a part of a mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.
Wollstonecraft dedicates significant portions of "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" to descriptions of nature and her emotional responses to it. One of her most effective tactics is to associate a set of thoughts and feelings with a specific natural formation, such as the waterfall passage quoted above. Nature, Wollstonecraft assumes, is "a common reference point" between readers and herself, therefore her letters should generate a sense of social sympathy with them. Many of the letters contain these "miniature Romantic excursus" which illustrate Wollstonecraft's ideas regarding the connections between nature, God, and the self. The natural world becomes "the necessary ground of speculation and the crucial field of experience".

All of Wollstonecraft's writings, including the "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark", address the concerns of women in eighteenth-century society. As in previous works, she discusses concrete issues such as childcare and relationships with servants, but unlike her more <a href="polemic">polemic</a>al books such as "<a href="Thoughts%20on%20the%20Education%20of%20Daughters">Thoughts on the Education of Daughters</a>" (1787) or the "Rights of Woman", this text emphasizes her emotional reactions to nature and maternity. Yet she does not depart from her interest in promoting women's education and rights. In Letter 19, the most explicitly feminist letter, Wollstonecraft anticipates readers' criticisms: "still harping on the same subject, you will exclaim – How can I avoid it, when most of the struggles of an eventful life have been occasioned by the oppressed state of my sex: we reason deeply, when we forcibly feel." Wollstonecraft comes to the realization that she has always been forced to experience the world as a woman—it is the defining feature of her sense of self.

Throughout "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark", Wollstonecraft comments on the precarious position women occupy in society. She defends and sympathizes with <a href="Caroline%20Matilda%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Caroline of Denmark</a>, for example, who had been accused of "licentiousness" for her extra-marital affair during her marriage to the insane <a href="Christian%20VII%20of%20Denmark">Christian VII</a>. (Wollstonecraft herself had had unorthodox love affairs and an illegitimate child.) Wollstonecraft describes this royal, who was also a progressive social reformer, as a woman of courage who tried to revolutionize her country before it was prepared. Such examples fuel Wollstonecraft's increasing despair and melancholy. At one point, she laments the fate of her daughter:

You know that as a female I am particularly attached to her – I feel more than a mother's fondness and anxiety, when I reflect on the dependent and oppressed state of her sex. I dread lest she should be forced to sacrifice her heart to her principles, or principles to her heart. With trembling hand I shall cultivate sensibility, and cherish delicacy of sentiment, lest, whilst I lend fresh blushes to the rose, I sharpen the thorns that will wound the breast I would fain guard – I dread to unfold her mind, lest it should render her unfit for the world she is to inhabit – Hapless woman! what a fate is thine!

Wollstonecraft's anger and frustration over the secondary status afforded women compels her to define herself in antithesis to conventional images of femininity. In the first letter she proudly announces "at supper my host told me bluntly that I was a woman of observation, for I asked him "men's questions"" (emphasis Wollstonecraft's).

Wollstonecraft casts the female imagination as the productive counterpoint to destructive masculine commerce, a feat she achieves primarily through her use of the genre of the letter. While the "Rights of Woman" argued that women should be "useful" and "productive", importing the language of the market into the home, "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" adopts the values of the domestic space for the larger social and political world.

Although Wollstonecraft spends much of "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" musing on nature and its connection to the self, a great deal of the text is actually about the debasing effects of commerce on culture. She argues, for example, that the damage done to Hamburg and France by mercenaries and an increasingly commercial culture is far greater than the damage caused by the violence of the <a href="French%20revolution">French revolution</a>, writing that "the sword has been merciful, compared with the depredations made on human life by contractors, and by the swarm of locusts who have battened on the pestilence they spread abroad". Wollstonecraft believed that commerce "embruted" the mind and fostered a selfish disposition in its practitioners. Commerce should be, she thought, "regulated by ideas of justice and fairness and directed toward the ideals of independence and benevolence".

Wollstonecraft had become disenchanted with Imlay not only because of his dismissive attitude towards her but also because of his greed. Throughout "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark", she attaches criticisms of commerce to the anonymous lover who has betrayed her:
A man ceases to love humanity, and then individuals, as he advances in the chase after wealth; as one clashes with his interest, the other with his pleasures: to business, as it is termed, every thing must give way; nay, is sacrificed; and all the endearing charities of citizen, husband, father, brother, become empty names.

Throughout the text, she contrasts the constructive, creative imagination with destructive commerce. By associating commercialism with the anonymous lover in the text, Wollstonecraft was also directly censuring Imlay, who she believed cared more for his business speculations than for her and their child.

Wollstonecraft spends several large sections of "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" speculating about the possibilities of social and political revolution and outlining a trajectory for the progress of civilization. In comparing Norway with Britain and France, for example, she argues that the Norwegians are more progressive because they have a <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20press">free press</a>, embrace <a href="religious%20toleration">religious toleration</a>, distribute their land fairly, and have a politically active populace. However, her description of Norway's "golden age" becomes less rhapsodic after she discovers that the country has no universities or scientists.

In many ways Norwegian society embodied the British <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29%23United%20Kingdom">radical</a> ideal of "a small-producer society, its wealth sufficiently dispersed to ensure rough equality", similar to what Wollstonecraft had outlined in "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Men">A Vindication of the Rights of Men</a>" (1790). After careful consideration of how to improve the social and political problems in the places she visited, Wollstonecraft came to the conclusion that social progress must occur at a measured and "natural" rate. She argues that each country has to find its own way to improve, that democratic revolution cannot be foisted upon a people. She believed that the lower classes and the <a href="yeomen">yeomen</a> were the most promising "potential source of revolutionary social transformation". Implicit in her assessment, however, was a <a href="bourgeois">bourgeois</a> condescension; she viewed the lower classes as a group separate from herself, at one point describing their behavior as "picturesque".

Wollstonecraft was prompted to publish "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" because she was heavily in debt. The successful sales of this, her most popular book in the 1790s, came at an opportune moment. Well-received by reviewers, the work was translated into German, Dutch, Swedish, and Portuguese; published in America; and reissued in a second edition in 1802.

<a href="Amelia%20Opie">Amelia Alderson</a> praised the work, separating the philosopher from the woman: "As soon as I read your Letters from Norway, the cold awe which the philosopher had excited was lost in the tender sympathy call'd forth by the woman." <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, Wollstonecraft's future husband, wrote in his "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" that reading "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" caused him to fall in love with Wollstonecraft:

If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.

Connecting the work to Wollstonecraft's first novel, "" (1788), he celebrates its <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a> and "eroticizes the condition of feminine sorrow"; for Godwin, the work was an <a href="Epistolary%20novel">epistolary romance</a>, not a work of political commentary. After Wollstonecraft's death in 1797, Godwin published her original letters to Imlay (destroying the originals in the process). He deleted all references to contemporary political events and her business negotiations, emphasizing the romantic connection between the two sets of letters. Favret contends that Godwin wanted the public to see Wollstonecraft's affair as a sentimental romance akin to that between Charlotte and Werther in <a href="Goethe">Goethe's</a> "<a href="Sorrows%20of%20Young%20Werther">Sorrows of Young Werther</a>" (1774).

For a woman, a one-year-old child, and a maid to travel to Scandinavia without the protection of a man was unprecedented in the eighteenth century. The book resulting from the trip also seemed highly unusual to readers at the time: details of Wollstonecraft's travels to a rarely visited area of the world, what one editor of the "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" describes as "a boreal wilderness", intrigued and even shocked contemporary readers. The unorthodox theology of the book also alienated some readers. The " Monthly Magazine and American Review" wrote:

[She] discarded all faith in christianity. ... From this period she adored [God] ... not as one whose interposing power is ever silently at work on the grand theatre of human affairs, causing eventual good to spring from present evil, and permitting nothing but for wise and benevolent purposes; but merely as the first great cause and vital spring of existence.

"Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" retreated from Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, shocking some conservative readers who were not prepared to accept anything akin to <a href="deism">deism</a>. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of sensibility, fellow feminist and author <a href="Mary%20Hays">Mary Hays</a> criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, "The Wanderer in Norway" (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented her work as a failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a <a href="cautionary%20tale">cautionary tale</a>, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" placed the narrator/Mary in the position of a <a href="sentimental%20novel">sentimental heroine</a>, while the text itself, with its fusion of sensibility and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.

After the publication of Godwin's "Memoirs", which revealed and endorsed Wollstonecraft's love affairs and illegitimate child, her works were scorned by the majority of the public. Nevertheless, "the book was to arouse a passion for travel among cultivated people in Europe". Intrepid nineteenth-century British female travel writers such as <a href="Isabella%20Bird">Isabella Bird</a> and <a href="Mary%20Kingsley">Mary Kingsley</a> still read it and were inspired by Wollstonecraft's pioneering efforts. "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" was republished at the end of the nineteenth century and <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>, the author of "<a href="Treasure%20Island">Treasure Island</a>", took a copy on his trip to <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a> in 1890.

"Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" was a powerful influence on Wollstonecraft's daughter, <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>. In 1817, Shelley would publish "<a href="History%20of%20a%20Six%20Weeks%27%20Tour">History of a Six Weeks' Tour</a>", a narrative of her travels through Europe and to <a href="Lake%20Geneva">Lake Geneva</a> which was modeled after her mother's work.

The <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> poets were more profoundly affected by "Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark" than anyone, except perhaps Godwin. The poet <a href="Robert%20Southey">Robert Southey</a>, for example, wrote to his publisher: "Have you met with Mary Wollstonecraft's [travel book]? She has made me in love with a cold climate, and frost and snow, with a northern moonlight." The book's combination of progressive social views with the advocacy of individual subjective experience influenced writers such as <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>. Wollstonecraft's "incarnational theory of the creative imagination" paved the way for Wordsworth's thorough treatment of the imagination and its relation to the self in Book V of "<a href="The%20Prelude">The Prelude</a>" (1805; 1850). Her book also had a significant influence on Coleridge's "<a href="Rime%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Mariner">Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>" (1797–99) and <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Shelley's</a> "<a href="Alastor%2C%20or%20The%20Spirit%20of%20Solitude">Alastor</a>" (1815); their depictions of "quest[s] for a settled home" strongly resemble Wollstonecraft's. The most striking homage to Wollstonecraft's work, however, is in Coleridge's famous poem "<a href="Kubla%20Khan">Kubla Khan</a>" (1797; 1816). Not only does much of his style descend from the book, but at one point he alludes to Wollstonecraft as he is describing a cold wasteland:

SMS "Mecklenburg" ("His Majesty's Ship "<a href="Mecklenburg">Mecklenburg</a>"") was the fifth ship of the of <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s of the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">German Imperial Navy</a>. Laid down in May 1900 at the <a href="AG%20Vulcan%20Stettin">AG Vulcan</a> shipyard in <a href="Stettin">Stettin</a>, Germany (now <a href="Szczecin">Szczecin</a>, Poland), she was finished in May 1903. Her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s were , , , and ; they were the first capital ships built under the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Navy Law of 1898</a>, championed by <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>. "Mecklenburg" was armed with a main battery of four guns and had a top speed of .

"Mecklenburg" spent the early period of her career in the I Squadron of the German fleet, participating in the peacetime routine of training cruises and exercises. After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> began in August 1914, the ship was mobilized with her sisters as the IV Battle Squadron. She saw limited duty in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> against Russian naval forces, and as a <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a> in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. The German High Command withdrew the ship from active service in January 1916 due to a threat from submarines and <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s, together with severe shortages in personnel. For the remainder of her career, "Mecklenburg" served as a prison ship and as a barracks ship based in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. She was stricken from the navy list in January 1920 and sold for scrapping the following year.

After the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The Secretary of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office), "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hollmann">Friedrich von Hollmann</a> struggled throughout the early- and mid-1890s to secure parliamentary approval for the first three s, but in June 1897, Hollmann was replaced by "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" (Rear Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>, who quickly proposed and secured approval for the first <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Naval Law</a> in early 1898. The law authorized the last two ships of the class, as well as the five ships of the , the first class of battleship built under Tirpitz's tenure. The "Wittelsbach"s were broadly similar to the "Kaiser Friedrich"s, carrying the same armament but with a more comprehensive armor layout.

"Mecklenburg" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>; she had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward. At full load, she displaced up to . The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple-expansion%20engine">triple-expansion engine</a>s that drove three screws. Steam was provided by six coal-fired <a href="Thornycroft%20boiler">Thornycroft boiler</a>s and six coal-fired cylindrical boilers. "Mecklenburg"s powerplant was rated at , which gave her a top speed of . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men.

The ship's primary armament consisted of a main battery of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40 guns</a> and twelve <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns</a>. Her weaponry was rounded out with six torpedo tubes, all submerged in the hull; one was in the bow, one in the stern, and the other four on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. Her <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> was thick in the central portion that protected her <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and machinery spaces and reduced to on either end of the hull. The <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was thick. "Mecklenburg"s main battery turrets had of armor plating.

"Mecklenburg"s keel was laid down on 15 May 1900 at <a href="AG%20Vulcan">AG Vulcan</a> in <a href="Stettin">Stettin</a>, under construction number 248. She was ordered under the contract name "F", as a new unit for the fleet. "Mecklenburg", the last ship of her class, was launched on 9 November 1901; the ceremony was attended by <a href="Frederick%20Francis%20IV%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Mecklenburg-Schwerin">Frederick Francis IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin</a>. Fitting-out work proceeded faster on "Mecklenburg" than on her sister , and so the former was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 25 June 1903, a full year before "Schwaben". "Mecklenburg" cost 22,329,000 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">marks</a>.

Immediately following her commissioning, "Mecklenburg" began <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a>, which lasted until mid-December 1903. She was assigned to the II Division of the I Squadron, alongside the battleships and . "Mecklenburg" had to enter the drydock at <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> (Imperial Shipyard) at <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> for minor improvements and repairs following her trials; this work lasted until the end of February 1904. After these modifications, "Mecklenburg" took part in individual and squadron training exercises, and a fleet review for the visiting British King <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a> in June. The following month, the German fleet went on a cruise to Britain, the Netherlands, and Norway that lasted until August. "Mecklenburg" then participated in the annual autumn fleet exercises, which took place in late August and September, and a winter training cruise in November and December.

Starting in mid-December 1904, "Mecklenburg" went into Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance, which lasted until the beginning of March 1905. After emerging from drydock, "Mecklenburg" joined her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> on a cruise through the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> to Kiel. While steaming through the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a> on 3 March, "Mecklenburg" struck the <a href="Hatterrev">Hatter Reef</a> off <a href="Sams%C3%B8">Samsø</a>, Denmark, and became stuck. Another sister ship, , and the light cruiser were sent to assist "Wittelsbach" in pulling "Mecklenburg" free of the reef. "Mecklenburg" then steamed under her own power to Kiel, where dockyard workers discovered a large dent in her bottom. Repair work was completed at the "Kaiserliche Werft" in Wilhelmshaven by 20 April, allowing her to participate in the normal routine of training cruises and maneuvers with the fleet for the remainder of the year. During this period, the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> visited the German fleet while it was moored in <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>. From mid-February to the end of March 1906, "Mecklenburg" was in the "Kaiserliche Werft" in Wilhelmshaven for her annual overhaul. The training routine continued without incident through 1907 but, in early April 1908, a major accident in one of "Mecklenburg"s broadside torpedo rooms nearly sank her. Water began to flood the ship and could only be stopped by sealing the torpedo tubes from the outside; repairs lasted until May.

"Mecklenburg" participated in a training cruise to the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> in July and August 1908. She also won the Kaiser's "Schießpreis" (Shooting Prize) for the most accurate gunnery in her squadron, along with the battleship . In mid-December, she returned once again to Wilhelmshaven for the yearly overhaul. The years 1909 and 1910 passed uneventfully for "Mecklenburg", with the same pattern of training cruises and maneuvers as in previous years. She began her annual overhaul on 2 December 1910 and returned to service on 7 March 1911, though only briefly. On 31 July, "Mecklenburg" was replaced by the new <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> ; "Mecklenburg" was then decommissioned and assigned to the Reserve Division in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. On 9 May 1912, she was transferred to the Reserve Division in the Baltic. She returned briefly to active service in 1912 from 9 to 12 May to move her from the North Sea to the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a>, and again from 14 August to 28 September to participate in the fleet exercises that year. During the maneuvers, she served in the III Squadron.

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, "Mecklenburg" and the rest of her class were mobilized to serve in the IV Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral <a href="Ehrhard%20Schmidt%20%28admiral%29">Ehrhard Schmidt</a>. The squadron was initially allocated to the North Sea, but was temporarily transferred to the Baltic in September. Starting on 3 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> , conducted a sweep into the eastern Baltic in the direction of the <a href="Svenska%20H%C3%B6garna">Svenska Högarna</a> islands. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. The squadron participated in a demonstration off <a href="Windau">Windau</a> the next day. From 5 December to 2 April 1915, "Mecklenburg" and the rest of the squadron were assigned to guard duty in the North Sea, based in the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>.

In May 1915, IV Squadron, including "Mecklenburg", was transferred to support the German Army in the Baltic Sea area. "Mecklenburg" and her sisters were then based in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. From 8 to 12 May, she participated in a sweep toward <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a> and <a href="Bogsk%C3%A4r">Bogskär</a>, to support the assault on <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a>. "Mecklenburg" and the other ships stood off Gotland to intercept any Russian cruisers that might try to intervene in the landings, but this did not occur. On 10 May, after the invasion force had entered Libau, the British submarines and spotted the IV Squadron, but were too far away to make an attack. After the operation, "Mecklenburg" and the rest of the IV Squadron returned to the Elbe for guard duties, which lasted until 4 July. The next day, "Mecklenburg" departed for Kiel in preparation for a major operation in the Baltic. She proceeded to Danzig, and on 11 July departed for a sweep to <a href="Gotska%20Sand%C3%B6n">Gotska Sandön</a>; another patrol to western Gotland followed on 21–22 July. "Mecklenburg" then steamed from Danzig to Libau on 2 August, where she joined another foray toward Gotska Sandön from 7 to 10 August.

"Mecklenburg" and her sisters were not included in the German fleet that <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">assaulted the Gulf of Riga</a> in August 1915, due to the scarcity of escorts. The increasingly active British submarines forced the Germans to employ more destroyers to protect the capital ships. "Mecklenburg" took part in two sweeps to <a href="Huvudsk%C3%A4r">Huvudskär</a> on 9–11 and 21–23 September. On 17 December she ran aground in the entrance to the harbor of Libau, but was towed free without suffering any damage. She was to replace the worn-out armored cruiser in the reconnaissance forces of the fleet in the Baltic, but "Mecklenburg" and her sisters were removed from service shortly thereafter. By this stage of the war, the German Navy was facing severe shortages of crews, which could be alleviated by the decommissioning of older, less effective warships. Furthermore, the increasing threat from British submarines and Russian mines in the Baltic by 1916, the latter of which sank the armored cruiser , convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly "Wittelsbach"-class ships from active service. On 6 January 1916, "Mecklenburg" left Libau bound for Kiel, arriving the following day. She was decommissioned on 24 January and placed in reserve.

"Mecklenburg" was initially based in Kiel and used as a floating prison. In early 1918, she became a barracks ship for the crews of <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s being repaired in Kiel. The ship was briefly retained after the German defeat at the end of World War I, but was to be discarded under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which limited the re-formed "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>" to eight pre-dreadnought battleships of the and es, of which only six could be operational at any given time. Accordingly, on 25 January 1920, "Mecklenburg" was stricken from the naval register. She was sold to <a href="Deutsche%20Werke">Deutsche Werke</a>, a shipbuilder based in Kiel, on 16 August 1921 for 1,750,000 Marks, and was <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for scrap metal that year at Kiel-Nordmole.

SMS "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" ("HMS Emperor <a href="Wilhelm%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor">William the Great</a>") was a German <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a> of the , built around the turn of the 20th century. The ship was one of the first battleships built by the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">German Imperial Navy</a> (Kaiserliche Marine) as part of a program of naval expansion under <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was built in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> at the <a href="Friedrich%20Krupp%20Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> shipyard. She was laid down in January 1898, launched in June 1899, and completed in May 1901. The ship was armed with a main battery of four guns in two twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s.

"Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" served in the main fleet—the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet) and later the "<a href="Hochseeflotte">Hochseeflotte</a>" (High Seas Fleet)—for the first seven years of her career. She participated in several of the fleet's training cruises and maneuvers, primarily in the <a href="North%20Sea">North</a> and <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>s. Her peacetime career was relatively uneventful and she suffered no accidents. She was decommissioned for a major reconstruction in 1908–10, after which she was assigned to the Reserve Division with her four <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s.

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in 1914, the battleship and her sisters were placed back in active service as the V Battle Squadron of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> and tasked with coastal defense in the North Sea. They were also deployed briefly to the Baltic but saw no action. In 1915, the ships were again withdrawn from service and relegated to secondary duties. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was used as a <a href="depot%20ship">depot ship</a> in Kiel and eventually a torpedo <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a>. After the war, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> greatly reduced the size of the German Navy. The vessel was sold for scrapping to a German company and broken up in 1920.

After the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The former Secretary of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office), <a href="Leo%20von%20Caprivi">Leo von Caprivi</a> became the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor of Germany</a> in 1890, and "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hollmann">Friedrich von Hollmann</a> became the new Secretary of the "Reichsmarineamt". Hollmann requested the first in 1892, but the <a href="Franco-Russian%20Alliance">Franco-Russian Alliance</a>, signed the year before, put the government's attention on expanding the Army's budget. Parliamentary opposition forced Hollmann to delay until the following year, when Caprivi spoke in favor of the project, noting that Russia's recent naval expansion threatened Germany's <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> coastline. In late 1893, Hollmann presented the Navy's estimates for the 1894–1895 budget year, and now the "Reichstag" approved the new ship; a second member of the class followed in early 1896, and the third ship, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was authorized for the following year's budget.

"Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward and aft. She displaced normally and up to at full load. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple-expansion%20engine">triple-expansion</a> <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a>s that drove three screw propellers. Steam was provided by four Marine-type and eight <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">cylindrical boilers</a>, all of which burned coal. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of .

The ship's armament consisted of a main battery of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40 guns</a> and twelve <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns</a>. She also carried twelve <a href="3.7%20cm%20Maxim%20machine%20cannon">machine cannon</a>. Six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s were mounted in above-water swivel mounts. The ship's <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was thick, and the deck was thick. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> and main battery turrets were protected with of armor, and the secondary casemates received of protection.

<a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>, the emperor of Germany, believed that a strong navy was necessary for the country to expand its influence outside continental Europe. He initiated a program of naval expansion in the late 1880s; the first battleships built under this program were the four "Brandenburg"-class ships. These were immediately followed by the five "Kaiser Friedrich III"-class battleships, of which "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was the third. Her keel was laid on 22 January 1898 at the <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> shipyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>, as construction number 22. She was ordered under the contract name "Ersatz König Wilhelm", to replace the obsolete armored frigate . Her scheduled launching on 29 April 1899 was delayed to 1 June after a large fire at the shipyard damaged the slipway. <a href="Princess%20Louise%20of%20Prussia">Louise</a>, the Grand Duchess of Baden, christened the ship after her father <a href="Wilhelm%20I%20of%20Germany">Wilhelm I of Germany</a>, the ship's namesake. Wilhelm II gave the launching speech for the ship commemorating his grandfather. After completing <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a> work, dockyard <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a> began on 19 February 1901, followed by acceptance trials that started on 18 March. These were completed by May, and she was formally commissioned on 5 May. That year, <a href="Erich%20Raeder">Erich Raeder</a>—who went on to command the "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>—was promoted to serve as a watch officer aboard her.

After commissioning in 1901, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" joined her sister ships in the I Squadron of the "Heimatflotte" (Home Fleet). After her sister ran aground and had to be docked for repairs, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" replaced her as the I Squadron <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, which was commanded by <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281862-1929%29">Prince Heinrich</a>, the brother of Wilhelm II. She held this post until 24 October, when "Kaiser Friedrich III" returned to service. In the meantime, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was present for the <a href="Kiel%20Week">Kiel Week</a> sailing <a href="regatta">regatta</a> in June and the dedication of a monument at the <a href="German%20Imperial%20Naval%20Academy">"Marineakademie"</a> (Naval Academy) in Kiel. At the end of July, she led the squadron on a cruise to Spanish waters, and while docked in <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>, they rendezvoused with the "Brandenburg"-class battleships returning from East Asian waters. The I Squadron was back in Kiel by 11 August, though the late arrival of the "Brandenburg"s delayed the participation of the I Squadron in the annual autumn fleet training. The maneuvers began with exercises in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>, followed by a mock attack on the fortifications in the lower <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>. Gunnery drills took place in <a href="Kiel%20Bay">Kiel Bay</a> before the fleet steamed to <a href="Danzig%20Bay">Danzig Bay</a>, where the maneuvers concluded on 15 September. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and the rest of I Squadron went on their normal winter cruise to Norway in December, which included a stop at <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> from 7 to 12 December.

In 1902, the new battleship ran aground off <a href="Kors%C3%B8r">Korsør</a>; "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" took her under tow back to port. The I Squadron went on a short cruise in the western Baltic then embarked on a major cruise around the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, which lasted from 25 April to 28 May. Individual and squadron maneuvers took place from June to August, interrupted only by a cruise to Norway in July. The annual fleet maneuvers began in August in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the <a href="Jade%20Bight">Jade</a>. During the exercises, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was assigned to the "<a href="Opfor">hostile</a>" force, as were several of her sister ships. The "hostile" force was first tasked with preventing the "German" squadron from passing through the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a> in the Baltic. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and several other battleships were then tasked with forcing an entry into the mouth of the Elbe River, where the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a> and <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> could be seized. The "hostile" flotilla accomplished these tasks within three days. The regular winter cruise followed during 1–12 December.

In 1903, the fleet, which was composed of only one squadron of battleships, was reorganized as the "Active Battle Fleet". "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" remained in the I Squadron along with her sister ships and the newest s, while the older "Brandenburg"-class ships were placed in reserve to be rebuilt. The first quarter of 1903 followed the usual pattern of training exercises. The squadron went on a training cruise in the Baltic, followed by a voyage to Spain from 7 May to 10 June. In July, the I Squadron went on its annual cruise to Norway. The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea, a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September, and finally a mock attack on Kiel. The exercises concluded on 12 September. The winter cruise began on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and continued into the Skagerrak on 1 December.

The I Squadron held its first exercise of 1904 in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January. Further squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March. A major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May, and in July the I Squadron and the <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> visited Britain, stopping at <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 10 July. The German fleet departed on 13 July, bound for the Netherlands; the I Squadron anchored in <a href="Vlissingen">Vlissingen</a> the following day. There, the ships were visited by Queen <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Wilhelmina</a>. The I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July, when it departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet. The squadron stopped in <a href="Molde">Molde</a>, Norway, on 29 July, while the other units went to other ports. The fleet reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August. The fleet then began preparations for the autumn maneuvers, which began on 29 August in the Baltic. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September, where it took part in a major <a href="amphibious%20warfare">landing operation</a>, after which the ships took the ground troops from the <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">IX Corps</a> that participated in the exercises to <a href="Altona%2C%20Hamburg">Altona</a> for a parade for Wilhelm II. The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> on 6 September. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it participated in further landing operations with the IX Corps and the <a href="Guards%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">Guards Corps</a>. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end. The I Squadron went on its winter training cruise, this time to the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.

The ships of the I Squadron went on a pair of training cruises during 9–19 January and 27 February – 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. The fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. The summer cruise ended on 9 August; the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> that month. The British fleet stopped in Danzig, <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>, and <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and the main German fleet were anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit's impact was lessened by the ongoing <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">Anglo-German naval arms race</a>. As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. During the exercises, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" won the Kaiser's "Schiesspreis" (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the I Squadron. In October, the ship was reassigned to the I Division of the II Squadron. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. On the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.

Over the winter of 1906–07, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" underwent a major <a href="%3Awikt%3Aoverhaul">overhaul</a> in Kiel, which was completed by the end of April. By this time, the newest s were coming into service; along with the s, these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons. As a result, the "Heimatflotte" was renamed the "Hochseeflotte" (<a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>). Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a> into the Baltic. The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July. The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">Haakon VII</a> on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland, to join exercises being conducted there. The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22–24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde%20Bay">Eckernförde Bay</a> outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days.

A shorter period of dockyard work took place from 7 December to 27 January 1908. She returned to the fleet for the normal peacetime routine of training exercises, and after the conclusion of the autumn maneuvers, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was decommissioned in Kiel on 21 September. She was taken into the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> shipyard in Kiel for an extensive modernization that lasted until 1910. During the refit, four of the ship's 15 cm guns and the stern-mounted torpedo tube were removed. Two 8.8 cm guns were added and the arrangement of the 8.8 cm battery was modified. Her superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship's tendency to roll excessively, and the ship's funnels were lengthened. After reconstruction, the ship was assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic, along with her sister ships. She was reactivated on 31 July 1911 and assigned to the III Squadron during the annual fleet exercises, then returned on 15 September to the Reserve Division. She remained there for the rest of her peacetime career.

As a result of the outbreak of World War I, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914. The ships were prepared for war very slowly, and were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August. They were initially tasked with coastal defense, but they served in this capacity for a very short time. In mid-September, the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic, under the command of Prince Heinrich. He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault against the Russians at <a href="Windau">Windau</a>, but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan. Instead, the V Squadron was to carry the landing force, but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse " and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day, disembarked the landing force, and then proceeded to the North Sea, where they resumed <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a> duties. Before the end of the year, the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic.

Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>. On 26 December 1914, the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Pomerania">Bay of Pomerania</a> and then departed on the sortie. Two days later, the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag, and was back in Kiel by 30 December. The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties, but was withdrawn from front-line service in February 1915. Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet, coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime, necessitated the deactivation of "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" and her sisters. "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" first went to Hamburg, where her crew was reduced on 5 March. She was moved to Kiel on 30 April, where the rest of her crew were removed. She was disarmed and thereafter used as a depot ship. The following year, the ship was used as a torpedo <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a>. In November 1918, Germany surrendered and signed the <a href="First%20Armistice%20at%20Compi%C3%A8gne">Armistice at Compiègne</a> that ended the fighting. According to of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, signed on 28 June 1919, that formally ended the war, Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the ""Deutschland" or types". On 6 December 1919, the vessel was struck from the <a href="Navy%20list">naval list</a> and sold to a <a href="shipbreaking">shipbreaking</a> firm based in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. The following year, "Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse" was broken up for scrap metal in Kiel-Nordmole.

1987 Giro d'Italia

The 1987 Giro d'Italia was a cycling competition and the 70th edition of <a href="Giro%20d%27Italia">the race</a>, one of cycling's <a href="Grand%20Tour%20%28cycling%29">Grand Tours</a>. It began on 21 May with a prologue in <a href="Sanremo">San Remo</a>, and concluded on 13 June with a <a href="individual%20time%20trial">individual time trial</a> in <a href="Saint-Vincent%2C%20Aosta%20Valley">Saint-Vincent</a>. A total of 180 riders from 20 teams entered the 22-stage, -long race, which was won by Irishman <a href="Stephen%20Roche">Stephen Roche</a> of the team. Second and third places were taken by British rider <a href="Robert%20Millar">Robert Millar</a> and Dutchman <a href="Erik%20Breukink">Erik Breukink</a>, respectively. It was the second time in the history of the Giro that the podium was occupied solely by non-Italian riders. Roche's victory in the 1987 Giro was his first step in completing the <a href="Triple%20Crown%20of%20Cycling">Triple Crown of Cycling</a> – winning the Giro d'Italia, the <a href="Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a>, and the <a href="UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">World Championship road race</a> in one calendar year – becoming the second rider ever to do so.

Roche's teammate and defending champion <a href="Roberto%20Visentini">Roberto Visentini</a> took the first race leader's "maglia rosa" () after winning the opening prologue, only to lose it to Breukink the following stage. Roche took the overall lead after his team, Carrera Jeans–Vagabond, won the stage three <a href="team%20time%20trial">team time trial</a>. Visentini regained the lead for a two-day period after the stage 13 individual time trial. The fifteenth stage of the 1987 Giro has been recognized as an iconic event in the history of the race because Roche rode ahead of teammate Visentini, despite orders from the team management, and took the race lead. Roche successfully defended the overall lead from attacks by Visentini and other general classification contenders until the event's finish in Saint-Vincent.

Stephen Roche became the first Irishman to win the Giro d'Italia. In addition to the general classification, Roche also won the <a href="Combination%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">combination classification</a>. In the other race classifications, <a href="Johan%20van%20der%20Velde">Johan van der Velde</a> of <a href="Gis%20Gelati">Gis Gelati–Jollyscarpe</a> won the <a href="Points%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">points classification</a>, <a href="Robert%20Millar">Robert Millar</a> of took the <a href="Mountains%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">mountains classification</a> green jersey, and <a href="Colnago-CSF%20Bardiani">Selca–Conti</a>'s <a href="Roberto%20Conti">Roberto Conti</a> completed the Giro as the <a href="Young%20rider%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">best neo-professional</a> in the general classification, finishing fifteenth overall. Panasonic–Isostar finished as the winners of the <a href="Team%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">team classification</a>, which ranks each of the twenty teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time.

A total of 20 teams were invited to participate in the 1987 Giro d'Italia. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a <a href="peloton">peloton</a> of 180 cyclists. The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place on 20 May, outside the Casino of <a href="Sanremo">San Remo</a>. From the riders that began this edition, 133 completed the race.

The teams entering the race were:

Reigning champion <a href="Roberto%20Visentini">Roberto Visentini</a> returned to the race in 1987 to defend his crown, despite not winning many races in his spring campaign. <a href="Francesco%20Moser">Francesco Moser</a>, who won in <a href="1984%20Giro%20d%27Italia">1984</a> and finished in the top three in <a href="1985%20Giro%20d%27Italia">1985</a> and <a href="1986%20Giro%20d%27Italia">1986</a>, did not participate because of a head trauma and bruises sustained in a crash in the weeks prior to the race. Spanish sports newspaper "<a href="El%20Mundo%20Deportivo%20%28newspaper%29">El Mundo Deportivo</a>" and Gian Paolo Ormezzano from Italy's "<a href="La%20Stampa">La Stampa</a>" named several other riders as contenders for the overall classification, such as <a href="Giuseppe%20Saronni">Giuseppe Saronni</a>, then-<a href="UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">world champion</a> <a href="Moreno%20Argentin">Moreno Argentin</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Roche">Stephen Roche</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Millar">Robert Millar</a>. Since team leader <a href="Greg%20LeMond">Greg LeMond</a> did not participate in the race due to injuries sustained in a , "El Mundo Deportivo" believed <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Bernard">Jean-François Bernard</a> to be a dark horse. "<a href="L%27Unit%C3%A0">L'Unità</a>" writer Gino Sala believed Roche, Saronni, and Visentini were the top three challengers for the overall crown, while Ormezzano considered that Argentin, <a href="Guido%20Bontempi">Guido Bontempi</a>, <a href="Urs%20Freuler">Urs Freuler</a>, and <a href="Paolo%20Rosola">Paolo Rosola</a> all had a great chance to win a stage in the race. Mario Fossati of "<a href="La%20Repubblica">La Repubblica</a>" also thought that Bernard, Bontempi, and <a href="Phil%20Anderson%20%28cyclist%29">Phil Anderson</a> could take a stage win.

There was a strong belief that the race would be a battle between Carrera Jeans–Vagabond teammates Visentini and Roche. "El Mundo Deportivo" stated that Visentini had the edge in the time trial discipline and sprinting, while Roche had the advantage in climbing mountains. However, unlike Visentini, Roche came into the race in great shape after winning the <a href="Tour%20de%20Romandie">Tour de Romandie</a> and placing second in the <a href="Li%C3%A8ge%E2%80%93Bastogne%E2%80%93Li%C3%A8ge">Liège–Bastogne–Liège</a> and the <a href="Crit%C3%A9rium%20International">Critérium International</a>. Cycling expert and author Bill McGann thought that the race would be disputed between Visentini and <a href="Gianbattista%20Baronchelli">Gianbattista Baronchelli</a>.

The route for the 1987 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public on television by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani on 21 February 1987. Covering a total of , it included five time trials (four <a href="individual%20time%20trial">individual</a> and one for <a href="team%20time%20trial">teams</a>), and thirteen stages with categorized climbs that awarded <a href="Mountains%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">mountains classification</a> points. Five of these thirteen stages had summit finishes: stage 1a, to San Romolo; stage 6, to <a href="Monte%20Terminillo">Monte Terminillo</a>; stage 15, to <a href="Sappada">Sappada</a>; stage 19, to <a href="Madesimo">Madesimo</a>; and stage 21, to <a href="Pila%2C%20Aosta%20Valley">Pila</a>. Another stage with a mountain-top finish was stage 13, which consisted of a climbing time trial to San Marino. The organizers chose to include one rest day between stages 10 and 11. When compared to the <a href="1986%20Giro%20d%27Italia">previous edition</a>, the race had the same number of stages – although one stage consisted of two half-stages – but was longer and contained an additional individual time trial. The sixteenth stage, which ran from Sappada to <a href="Canazei">Canazei</a>, was named the <a href="Glossary%20of%20bicycling%23Q">queen stage</a> for its five categorized climbs.

Race director Torriani was happy with the success the <a href="1985%20Giro%20d%27Italia">1985 Giro d'Italia</a> had when passing through the <a href="Aosta%20Valley">Aosta Valley</a> and chose to include this mountainous region, which lies adjacent to the <a href="Rh%C3%B4ne-Alpes">Rhône-Alpes</a>, in the 1987 route. With the Giro's return to the valley, "La Stampa" and the regional cycling federation director, Maggiorino Ferrero, speculated that the stages taking place in this region would be critical in deciding the general classification. Carlo Champvillair, a climbing champion of Aosta Valley, believed it to be a well-constructed, technical race route. The time trial in San Marino, the sixth stage with the finish atop Monte Terminillo, and the stages including the <a href="Dolomites">Dolomites</a> were seen by "L'Unità" writer Gino Sala as stages that would heavily influence the general classification. In addition, he said that the route was suited to well-rounded, strong, and durable riders. The prologue contained a descent of the <a href="Poggio%20di%20San%20Remo">Poggio</a>, a mountain used frequently in the <a href="Milan%E2%80%93San%20Remo">Milan–San Remo</a>, and was considered dangerous by some critics. However, Torriani decided to include the descent.

The Giro began with a prologue through the streets of San Remo. The returning winner of the Giro, Roberto Visentini, won the prologue by two tenths of a second over the Canadian rider <a href="Steve%20Bauer">Steve Bauer</a>. The next race day held two stages: a stage with a summit finish, followed by a downhill individual time trial. 's <a href="Erik%20Breukink">Erik Breukink</a> took the climbing half-stage win with a solo attack. His performance earned him the race leader's "maglia rosa" (), which he kept until the third stage. Stephen Roche won the time trial half-stage with a three-second margin over <a href="Del%20Tongo">Del Tongo</a>'s <a href="Lech%20Piasecki">Lech Piasecki</a>. <a href="Johan%20van%20der%20Velde">Johan van der Velde</a> formed a lead group with about to go in the second stage, but as he posed a threat to the race lead, he was not given a large advantage and was subsequently caught by the chasing peloton from the finish. The main field remained intact for the remaining kilometers and the race geared up for a sprint finish won by Moreno Argentin.

The third stage was a lengthy team time trial that stretched for between <a href="Lerici">Lerici</a> and <a href="Camaiore">Camaiore</a>. beat out the Del Tongo squad by fifty-four seconds to win the leg. In addition to the stage victory, Carrera Jeans–Vagabond's Roche took the overall lead. As the leading group approached the fourth stage finish line, Argentin sprinted away with to go and created a two-second gap between himself and the rider in second place that was enough to earn him a second stage win. The fifth stage was relatively flat and was used to set up the race to enter the <a href="Apennine%20Mountains">Apennine Mountains</a> the following day. The leg culminated in a mass sprint that was won by Panasonic–Isostar's Belgian rider <a href="Eddy%20Planckaert">Eddy Planckaert</a>, after overcoming Paolo Rosola in the closing meters.

Roche defended his race lead until stage thirteen, a climbing individual time trial to <a href="Monte%20Titano">Monte Titano</a> in <a href="San%20Marino">San Marino</a>, where he lost the pink jersey to his teammate and stage winner Visentini. Roche claimed his performance in the stage was hampered due to injuries sustained from a crash in the tenth stage. At , the fourteenth stage was the longest of the race. It was won in a mass sprint by <a href="Fanini-Maggi%20Mobili">Remac Fanini</a>'s <a href="Paolo%20Cimini">Paolo Cimini</a>, who overtook Rosola in the final meters.
The fifteenth stage saw the race enter the Dolomites and traverse three major climbs within the mountain chain. On the descent of the Monte Rest, Roche formed a leading group with two other riders after speeding away from the race leader's group. Despite orders from his team management, Roche continued with the move. The Carrera Jeans-Vagabond pack chased after the Roche group to protect the advantage of Roche's teammate and race leader Visentini. Roche crossed the finish line in twelfth place, fifty-six seconds after the stage winner van der Velde, which allowed him to don again the pink jersey by five seconds over <a href="Tony%20Rominger">Tony Rominger</a>. Roche's actions, taking the race lead away from Visentini and disobeying team commands, gained him the hatred of the Italian cyclings fans.

The sixteenth leg of the race included five categorized climbs before concluding in the municipality of Canazei. On the descent of the <a href="Passo%20Pordoi">Pordoi Pass</a>, van der Velde broke away and caught up to the leader on the road before winning his second consecutive stage. Meanwhile, behind van der Velde, Visentini tried several times to attack Roche on the slopes of the <a href="Passo%20Fedaia">Passo Fedaia</a>; however, Roche marked all of his moves and the two raced to the finish in the same group. Stage 17, the race's final day in the Dolomites, was marred by poor weather. A breakaway group of three was given a significant gap as the main general classification contenders rode behind in a collective group. <a href="Atala%20%28cycling%20team%29">Atala Ofmega</a>'s Italian rider <a href="Marco%20Vitali">Marco Vitali</a> out-sprinted his two fellow breakaway members to win his first Grand Tour stage win.

As the eighteenth stage began, the peloton felt they deserved a rest day after three difficult stages in the Dolomites and collectively rode at a non-aggressive pace for over three-quarters of the stage. Riders began to attack and form breakaway groups with about to go; however, the sprinters' teams reeled in all attacks and prepared for a sprint finish that was eventually won by <a href="Giuseppe%20Calcaterra">Giuseppe Calcaterra</a>, making it the second consecutive stage win for Atala-Ofmega. During the nineteenth stage, Jean-François Bernard launched an attack after the leading group finished the climb of the <a href="San%20Marco%20Pass">San Marco Pass</a>. Three riders joined Bernard before the start of the final climb in Madesimo, but Bernard dropped them early on in the climb and rode the final alone to win the stage. Millar and <a href="Marino%20Lejarreta">Marino Lejarreta</a> managed to gain over thirty seconds on Roche after they attacked on the final climb. Despite a crash within the final kilometer of stage twenty, the main field managed to hold a bunch sprint that was won by Rosola.
In the twenty-first leg, the general classification contenders were a part of the same leading group until the final climb to the summit finish in Pila. Lejarreta attacked from the finish and only seven other riders were able to mark, including Millar and Roche. Over later, the Spaniard attacked again and only Roche and Millar remained with him. Despite further attacks by Lejarreta, the group rode together up to the finish. With over to go, Millar unleashed a sprint that won him the stage. Millar's performance on the stay brought him to second place overall. The final stage of the 1987 Giro d'Italia was a individual time trial. Visentini, who had crashed in the previous stage, did not start and abandoned the race. Roche beat out the second-place finisher, Dietrich Thurau, by fourteen seconds to win the day and the overall race itself. In doing so, Roche became the first Irishman to win the Giro d'Italia. The other podium positions were filled by non-Italian riders for the second time in the history of the race.

Four riders achieved multiple stage victories: Argentin (stages 2, 4, and 7), Rosola (stages 8, 10, and 20), Visentini (prologue and stage 13), and Roche (stages 1b and 22). Stage wins were achieved by seven of the twenty competing squads, five of which won multiple stages. Gewiss-Bianchi collected a total of six stage wins through two riders, Argentin and Rosola. Carrera Jeans-Vagabond achieved the same feat with individual stage wins from Bontempi (stage 12), Roche and Visentini (two wins each), and a team time trial win (stage 3). Panasonic–Isostar amassed a total of three stage victories through Breukink (stage 1a), Planckaert (stage 5), and Millar (stage 21). Atala-Ofmega also secured three stage wins, through Freuler (stage 9), Vitali (stage 17), and Calcaterra (stage 18). Gis Gelati–Jollyscarpe won two stages with van der Velde (stages 15 and 16). Fagor–MBK also collected two stage successes, with <a href="Jean-Claude%20Bagot">Jean-Claude Bagot</a> (stage 6) and <a href="Robert%20Forest%20%28cyclist%29">Robert Forest</a> (stage 11). Remac–Fanini and Toshiba–Look both won a single stage at the Giro, the first through Cimini (stage 14), and the second through Bernard (stage 19).

Four different jerseys were worn during the 1987 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the <a href="General%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">general classification</a> – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. The time bonuses for the 1987 Giro were twenty seconds for the first place, fifteen seconds for the second place, ten seconds for the third place, and five seconds for the fourth place on the stage. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered to be the winner of the Giro.

For the <a href="Points%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">points classification</a>, which awarded a purple (or <a href="cyclamen">cyclamen</a>) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the <a href="Mountains%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">mountains classification</a> leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The "<a href="Cima%20Coppi">Cima Coppi</a>", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The "Cima Coppi" for this edition of the Giro was the <a href="Pordoi%20Pass">Passo Pordoi</a>, and the first rider to cross it was Fagor–MBK's <a href="Jean-Claude%20Bagot">Jean-Claude Bagot</a>. The white jersey was worn by the leader of <a href="Young%20rider%20classification%20in%20the%20Giro%20d%27Italia">young rider classification</a>, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.

Upon completing the final stage, Roche told the media that by winning the final time trial he felt he silenced any critics who doubted whether he should have won the race. In addition, Roche announced his intention to compete in the <a href="1987%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a> in July. He won the Tour with a margin of forty seconds over the second-place finisher and thus became the <a href="Grand%20Tour%20%28cycling%29%23Winners%20of%20two%20Grand%20Tours%20in%20a%20year">fifth rider</a> to win the Giro and Tour in the same year. In September, Roche won the <a href="1987%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">men's road race</a> at the <a href="1987%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships">1987 UCI Road World Championships</a> and became the second rider to achieve the <a href="Triple%20Crown%20of%20Cycling">Triple Crown of Cycling</a>, which consists of winning two <a href="Grand%20Tour%20%28cycling%29">Grand Tour</a> races and the <a href="UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">men's road race</a> at the <a href="UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships">UCI Road World Championships</a> in a calendar year. For his career successes in the Giro d'Italia, Roche was inducted into the race's Hall of Fame in 2014. After dropping out of the 1987 edition of the Giro, Visentini did not win any further stages or classifications in major races, and retired from cycling in 1990, at the age of 33.

"La Repubblica" stated that the Italian riders had the second worst performance in the history of the Giro after <a href="1972%20Giro%20d%27Italia">1972</a>, since none finished inside the top four and many famous Italian cyclists failed to complete the race. Mario Fossati, of "La Repubblica", thought that van der Velde and Bernard performed very strongly, along with Argentin, who he said was operating on "<a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a>". Fossati also said that Cimini and Calcaterra could have promising careers, based on their efforts during the race.

The 1987 Giro has become famous for the series of events involving teammates Roche and Visentini. Many writers highlight the fifteenth stage as the defining moment of the race. The "Corriere delle Alpi" and cycling book author Bill McGann even named it as one of the most famous in the Giro d'Italia and cycling history. On that day, Roche – who was second in the general classification and over two minutes behind race leader Visentini – attacked the lead, despite orders from his team to stop. Upon completing the stage, Visentini told the press that either Roche or himself would not start the following day, while Roche independently held a press conference from his hotel and answered questions. Carrera Jeans-Vagabond manager David Boifava ordered Roche and Visentini to stay silent. The following day, many Italian newspapers called Roche a betrayer or cheat for his actions. Despite Visentini's statement, both riders started the sixteenth stage after receiving orders from Carrera company boss Tito Tachella. In the days that followed, Italian fans threw things and spat at Roche, which led him to receive police protection until the race's conclusion. Looking back on the incident, Roche claimed that he just descended the mountain quicker than Visentini and did nothing wrong, while Visentini maintained that Roche attacked him when he should have been aiding him. Visentini accused Roche of dashing the team's morale and strategy, but some critics believed that Roche's actions were acceptable because he was the stronger rider.

She was the first capital ship built under the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Navy Law of 1898</a>, brought about by <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>. "Wittelsbach" was laid down in 1899 at the <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">Navy Dockyard</a> and completed in October 1902. She was armed with a main battery of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">guns</a> and had a top speed of . 

The ship served in the I Squadron of the German fleet for the majority of her peacetime career, which spanned from 1902 to 1910. During this period, she was occupied with extensive annual training and making good-will visits to foreign countries. The training exercises during this period provided the framework for the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>'s operations during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. She was <a href="ship%20decommissioning">decommissioned</a> in September 1910, but was reactivated in 1911 for <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> duties, which lasted through 1914.

After the start of World War I in August 1914, "Wittelsbach" was brought back to active duty in the IV Battle Squadron. The ship served in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, including during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">Battle of the Gulf of Riga</a> in August 1915, but saw no combat with Russian forces. By late 1915, crew shortages and the threat from British submarines forced the "Kaiserliche Marine" to withdraw older battleships like "Wittelsbach". The ship then saw service in auxiliary roles, first as a training ship and then as a <a href="ship%27s%20tender">ship's tender</a>. After the war, she was converted into a tender for <a href="minesweeper">minesweeper</a>s in 1919. In July 1921, the ship was sold and <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for <a href="scrap%20metal">scrap metal</a>.

After the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The Secretary of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office), "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" ("VAdm"—Vice Admiral) <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hollmann">Friedrich von Hollmann</a> struggled—ultimately successfully—throughout the early and mid-1890s to secure parliamentary approval for the first three s. In June 1897, Hollmann was replaced by "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" ("KAdm"—Rear Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>, who quickly proposed and secured approval for the first <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Naval Law</a> in early 1898. The law authorized the last two ships of the class, as well as the five ships of the , the first class of battleship built under Tirpitz's tenure. The "Wittelsbach"s were broadly similar to the "Kaiser Friedrich"s, carrying the same armament but with a more comprehensive armor layout.

"Wittelsbach" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward. She <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> up to at full load. Unlike her sister ships, "Wittelsbach" was completed with provisions for a squadron commander's staff, including a larger <a href="Bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a>. The ship was propelled by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple%20expansion%20engine">triple expansion engine</a>s that drove three <a href="propeller">screws</a>. Steam was provided by six <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">cylindrical</a> and six <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, all coal-fired. "Wittelsbach"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men.

"Wittelsbach"s armament consisted of a main battery of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40 guns</a> and twelve <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns</a>. The armament suite was rounded out with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all in above-water swivel mounts. The ship was protected with <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a> plate. Her <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> was thick in the central portion that protected her <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and machinery spaces, and the <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was thick. The main battery turrets had of armor plating.

"Wittelsbach"s <a href="keel">keel</a> was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 30 September 1899 at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> (Imperial Shipyard) in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>, listed under construction number 25. She was ordered under the contract name "C", as a new unit for the fleet. "Wittelsbach" was launched on 3 July 1900, with <a href="Kaiser">Kaiser</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a> in attendance; <a href="Rupprecht%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Bavaria">Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria</a>, of the <a href="House%20of%20Wittelsbach">House of Wittelsbach</a>, gave a speech at her launching ceremony. Completion of the ship was delayed due to a collision with the <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad</a> , which accidentally rammed "Wittelsbach" in July 1902 while she was <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a>. She was commissioned on 15 October 1902, and thereafter began <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a>, which were completed in December. After trials ended, "Wittelsbach" was transferred from Wilhelmshaven to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, but she <a href="Ship%20grounding">ran aground</a> in the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a> in heavy fog on 13 December. The crew attempted to free the ship by removing stores to lighten her, and the battleship and the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> attempted to pull her free without success, before additional <a href="tugboat">tugs</a> and other vessels arrived to pull "Wittelsbach" free on 20 December. After arriving in Kiel, she entered <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">"Kaiserliche Werft" Kiel</a> for repairs.
On 1 March 1903, she became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of "KAdm" <a href="Gustav%20Schmidt%20%28Admiral%29">Gustav Schmidt</a>, the deputy commander of the <a href="I%20Squadron">I Squadron</a>. That year, the squadron was occupied with the normal peacetime routine of individual and unit training, including a training cruise in the Baltic, followed by a voyage to Spain that lasted from 7 May to 10 June. In July, she embarked on the annual cruise to Norway with the rest of the squadron. The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September, and finally a mock attack on Kiel. The exercises concluded on 12 September. The year's training schedule concluded with a cruise into the eastern Baltic that started on 23 November and a cruise into the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> that began on 1 December. "Wittelsbach" and the I Squadron participated in an exercise in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904. Further squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March, and a major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May. In July, the I Squadron and the <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> visited Britain, including a stop at <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 10 July. The German fleet departed on 13 July, bound for the Netherlands; the I Squadron anchored in <a href="Vlissingen">Vlissingen</a> the following day. There, the ships were visited by Queen <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Wilhelmina</a>. The I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July, when they departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet. The squadron stopped in <a href="Molde">Molde</a>, Norway, on 29 July, while the other units went to other ports.

The fleet reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August. During its cruise in the North Sea, the fleet experimented with <a href="wireless%20telegraphy">wireless telegraphy</a> on a large scale and searchlights at night for communication and recognition signals. Immediately after returning to Kiel, the fleet began preparations for the autumn maneuvers, which began on 29 August in the Baltic. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September, where it took part in a major <a href="amphibious%20warfare">landing operation</a>, after which the ships took the ground troops from the <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">IX Corps</a> who had participated in the exercises to <a href="Altona%2C%20Hamburg">Altona</a> for a parade for Wilhelm II. The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> on 6 September. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a>, where it participated in further landing operations with the IX Corps and the <a href="Guards%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">Guards Corps</a>. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end. "Wittelsbach" became the squadron flagship on 1 October, flying the flag of "KAdm" <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Baudissin">Friedrich von Baudissin</a>. The I Squadron went on its winter training cruise, this time to the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.

"Wittelsbach" took part in a pair of training cruises with the I Squadron during 9–19 January and 27 February – 16 March 1905. Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. The fleet then cruised through the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> and stopped in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. The summer cruise ended on 9 August, though the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> that month. The British fleet stopped in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>, <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>, and <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy; "Wittelsbach" and the main German fleet was anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion. Politically, the visit was strained by the developing <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">Anglo-German naval arms race</a>. As a result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>. In September, "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Spee">Maximilian von Spee</a>, who would go on to command the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">East Asia Squadron</a> at the outbreak of World War I, took command of the ship.

In October, the I Squadron went on a cruise in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise—this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. While on the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises. The fleet undertook a heavier training schedule in 1906 than in previous years. The ships were occupied with individual, division and squadron exercises throughout April. Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a> into the Baltic. The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July. The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">Haakon VII</a> on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland, to join exercises being conducted there. The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. On 22–24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde%20Bay">Eckernförde Bay</a> outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days.

The ship participated in the uneventful winter cruise into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December. The first quarter of 1907 followed the previous pattern and, on 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-designated the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. From the end of May to early June the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea, returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat. This was followed by the regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August. During the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 26 August to 6 September, the fleet conducted landing exercises in northern <a href="Schleswig">Schleswig</a> with the IX Corps. The winter training cruise went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November. In May 1908, the fleet went on a major cruise into the Atlantic instead of its normal voyage in the North Sea, which included a stop in <a href="Horta%2C%20Azores">Horta</a> in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>. The fleet returned to Kiel on 13 August to prepare for the autumn maneuvers, which lasted from 27 August to 7 September. Division exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September. After the end of the maneuvers, "Wittelsbach" was relieved as the squadron flagship by the new battleship and became the flagship of the deputy commander.

"Wittelsbach" was replaced as the deputy command flagship on 20 September 1910, again by "Hannover", for decommissioning. Her crew was sent to man the newly commissioned dreadnought . After a year in reserve, "Wittelsbach" was reactivated on 16 October 1911 to replace the battleship in the Reserve Division of the North Sea. From 31 March to 28 April 1912, she operated with the Training Squadron, and on 9 May returned to the Reserve Division, this time relieving the battleship . She took part in the annual fleet maneuvers that year as the flagship of the III Squadron, then commanded by "VAdm" <a href="Max%20Rollmann">Max Rollmann</a>. "Wittelsbach" returned for another stint in the Training Squadron from 30 March to 21 April 1913. Wilhelm II commissioned a statue of <a href="Frithjof">Frithjof</a> that he gave to Norway; "Wittelsbach" was used to transport the statue, departing Kiel on 5 July and arriving in <a href="Balholmen">Balholmen</a> two days later. The ship was back in Germany in time for the fleet maneuvers in August, where she was assigned to the V Division of the III Squadron. After the completion of the maneuvers, she returned to the Reserve Division.

At the start of World War I, "Wittelsbach" was mobilized as part of the IV Battle Squadron, under the command of "VAdm" <a href="Ehrhard%20Schmidt">Ehrhard Schmidt</a>; she served as the flagship of the squadron, which also included her four sister ships and the battleships and . On 26 August 1914, the ships were sent to rescue the stranded <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , which had run aground off <a href="Odensholm">Odensholm</a> in the eastern Baltic, but by 28 August, the ship's crew had been forced to detonate explosives to destroy "Magdeburg" before the relief force had arrived. As a result, "Wittelsbach" and the rest of the squadron returned to <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> that day. Starting on 3 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle.

Two days later the ships were transferred to the North Sea, but stayed there only briefly, returning to the Baltic on 20 September. From 22 to 26 September, the squadron took part in a sweep into the eastern Baltic in an unsuccessful attempt to find and destroy Russian warships. From 4 December 1914 to 2 April 1915, the ships of the IV Squadron were tasked with coastal defense duties along Germany's North Sea coast against incursions from the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. On 3 April, "Wittelsbach" went into drydock in Kiel for periodic maintenance, before conducting training exercises in the western Baltic with the other ships of the VII Division of the IV Squadron, which included , , and .

The <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> requested naval assistance for its campaign against Russia; <a href="Prince%20Heinrich">Prince Heinrich</a>, the commander of all naval forces in the Baltic, made the VII Division, the <a href="IV%20Scouting%20Group">IV Scouting Group</a>, and the torpedo boats of the Baltic fleet available for the operation. On 6 May, the IV Squadron ships were tasked with providing support to the assault on <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a>. "Wittelsbach" and the other ships were stationed off <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a> to intercept any Russian cruisers that might attempt to intervene in the landings; the Russians did not do so. After cruisers from the IV Scouting Group encountered Russian cruisers off Gotland, the ships of the VII Division deployed—with a third dummy <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> erected to disguise them as the more powerful s—along with the cruiser . The ships advanced as far as the island of <a href="Ut%C3%B6%20%28Finland%29">Utö</a> on 9 May and to <a href="Kopparstenarna">Kopparstenarna</a> the following day, but by then the Russian cruisers had withdrawn. Later that day, the British submarines and spotted the IV Squadron, but were too far away to attack them.

From 27 May to 4 July, "Wittelsbach" was back in the North Sea, patrolling the mouths of the <a href="Jade%20%28river%29">Jade</a>, <a href="Ems%20%28river%29">Ems</a>, and Elbe rivers. During this period, the <a href="German%20Imperial%20Admiralty%20Staff">naval high command</a> realized that the old "Wittelsbach"-class ships would be useless in action against the Royal Navy, but could be effectively used against the much weaker Russian forces in the Baltic. As a result, the battleships were transferred back to the Baltic in July, and they departed Kiel on the 7th, bound for Danzig. On 10 July, the ships proceeded further east to <a href="Neufahrwassar">Neufahrwassar</a>, along with the vessels of the VIII Torpedo-boat Flotilla; after arriving, "Wittelsbach" ran aground and Schmidt transferred his flag to "Braunschweig". She was able to free herself and was not damaged in the incident, and the following day Schmidt returned to the ship. The IV Squadron ships sortied on 12 July to make a <a href="Demonstration%20%28military%29">demonstration</a>, returning to Danzig on 21 July without encountering Russian forces.

The following month, the naval high command began an operation against the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a> in support of the <a href="Gorlice%E2%80%93Tarn%C3%B3w%20Offensive">Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive</a> that the Army was waging. The Baltic naval forces were reinforced with significant elements of the High Seas Fleet, including the <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Battle Squadron</a>, the I Scouting Group, the <a href="II%20Scouting%20Group">II Scouting Group</a>, and the II Torpedo-boat Flotilla. Prince Heinrich planned that Schmidt's ships would force their way into the Gulf and destroy the Russian warships in Riga, while the heavy units of the High Seas Fleet would patrol to the north to prevent any of the main Russian <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a> that might try to interfere with the operation. The Germans launched their attack on 8 August, initiating the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">Battle of the Gulf of Riga</a>. <a href="Minesweeper">Minesweeper</a>s attempted to clear a path through the <a href="Irbe%20Strait">Irbe Strait</a>, covered by "Braunschweig" and "Elsass", while "Wittelsbach" and the rest of the squadron remained outside the strait. The Russian battleship attacked the Germans in the strait, forcing them to withdraw.

During the action, the cruiser and the torpedo boat were damaged by <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a> and the torpedo boats and were mined and sunk. Schmidt withdrew his ships to re-coal and Prince Heinrich debated making another attempt, as by that time it had become clear that the German Army's advance toward Riga had stalled. Prince Heinrich attempted to force the channel a second time using two <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s from the I Squadron to cover the minesweepers and leaving "Wittelsbach" behind in Libau. Following the unsuccessful second attempt, Schmidt became the I Squadron commander on 26 August, being replaced as the IV Squadron commander by "VAdm" <a href="Friedrich%20Schultz">Friedrich Schultz</a>, who also made "Wittelsbach" his flagship.

On 9 September, "Wittelsbach" and her four sisters sortied in an attempt to locate Russian warships off Gotland, but returned to port two days later without having engaged any opponents. On 7 and 8 October, she, "Elsass", and four torpedo boats covered a minelaying operation. By this point in the war, the Navy was encountering difficulties in manning more important vessels. The threat from submarines in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly "Wittelsbach"-class ships from active service. "Wittelsbach" and most of the other IV Squadron ships left Libau on 10 November, bound for Kiel; upon arrival the following day, they were designated the Reserve Division of the Baltic, commanded by "<a href="Kommodore">Kommodore</a>" (Commodore) <a href="Walter%20Engelhardt">Walter Engelhardt</a>. The ships were anchored in <a href="Schilksee">Schilksee</a> in Kiel, with "Wittelsbach" as the divisional flagship. On 31 January, the division was dissolved, and the ships were dispersed for subsidiary duties.

"Wittelsbach" was decommissioned on 24 August, and was initially used as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> based in Kiel. The ship was then transferred to Wilhelmshaven for use as a fleet tender in October 1917, where she supported the battleship , which was by then being used as a training ship for <a href="engine%20room">engine room</a> personnel. On 6 August 1918, the "Reichsmarineamt" decided to convert "Wittelsbach" into a <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a>, but the war ended with Germany's defeat before the work could begin. "Wittelsbach" was reactivated for service with the newly constituted <a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a> on 1 June 1919, and was converted into a <a href="depot%20ship">depot ship</a> for minesweepers. She carried 12 of these shallow-draft vessels. The ship served in this capacity from 20 July 1920 to 8 March 1921. "Wittelsbach" was stricken from the Navy List and sold four months later, on 7 July, for 3,561,000 <a href="German%20Papiermark">Marks</a>. The ship was then broken up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven.

SMS "Wettin" ("His Majesty's Ship "<a href="House%20of%20Wettin">Wettin</a>"") was a <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a> of the of the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy). She was built by <a href="Schichau%20Seebeckwerft">Schichau Seebeckwerft</a> in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>. "Wettin" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> in October 1899, and was completed October 1902. She and her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s—, , and —were the first <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s built under the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Navy Law of 1898</a>. "Wettin" was armed with a main battery of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">guns</a> and had a top speed of .

"Wettin" saw service in <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Squadron</a> of the German fleet for most of her career, along with her sister ships. She was occupied with extensive annual training, as well as making good-will visits to foreign countries. The training exercises provided the framework for the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>'s operations during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The ship was decommissioned in June 1911 as <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s began to enter service but was reactivated for duty as a gunnery <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> between December 1911 and mid-1914.

After the start of World War I in August 1914, the "Wittelsbach"-class ships were mobilized and designated IV Battle Squadron. She saw limited duty in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, but the ship played a minor role in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">Battle of the Gulf of Riga</a> in August 1915, though "Wettin" saw no combat with Russian forces. By late 1915, crew shortages and the threat from British submarines forced the "Kaiserliche Marine" to withdraw older battleships like "Wettin" from active service. For the remainder of the war, "Wettin" served as a training ship for <a href="naval%20cadet">naval cadet</a>s and as a <a href="depot%20ship">depot ship</a>. The ship was stricken from the <a href="naval%20register">navy list</a> after the war and sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapping</a> in 1921. Her bell is on display at the <a href="Milit%C3%A4rhistorisches%20Museum%20der%20Bundeswehr">Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr</a> in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>.

After the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) ordered the four s in 1889, a combination of budgetary constraints, opposition in the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">"Reichstag"</a> (Imperial Diet), and a lack of a coherent fleet plan delayed the acquisition of further battleships. The Secretary of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office), "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" ("VAdm"—Vice Admiral) <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Hollmann">Friedrich von Hollmann</a> struggled throughout the early and mid-1890s to secure parliamentary approval for the first three s. In June 1897, Hollmann was replaced by "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" ("KAdm"—Rear Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>, who quickly proposed and secured approval for the first <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Naval Law</a> in early 1898. The law authorized the last two ships of the class, as well as the five ships of the , the first class of battleship built under Tirpitz's tenure. The "Wittelsbach"s were broadly similar to the "Kaiser Friedrich"s, carrying the same armament but with a more comprehensive armor layout.

"Wettin" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>, with a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward and aft. She <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at full load. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple%20expansion%20engine">triple expansion engine</a>s that drove three screws. Steam was provided by six <a href="Thornycroft%20boiler">Thornycroft boiler</a>s and six <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">cylindrical boilers</a>, all of which burned coal. "Wettin"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . The ship could steam for at a cruising speed of . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men.

"Wettin"s armament consisted of a <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of four <a href="24%20cm%20SK%20L/40">24 cm (9.4 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">15 cm (5.9 inch) SK L/40 guns</a> and twelve <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/30%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns</a>, all in individual mounts in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s in the ship's <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> and superstructure. The armament suite was rounded out with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all submerged in the hull; one was in the bow, another in the stern, and two on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. The ship was protected with <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a> plate. In the central portion that protected her <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and propulsion machinery spaces, her <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> was thick, tapering to toward the <a href="Bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a> and <a href="stern">stern</a>. The <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armor was thick. The main battery turrets had of armor plating.

"Wettin"s keel was laid on 10 October 1899, at the <a href="Schichau-Werke">Schichau-Werke</a> in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>, under construction number 676. She was ordered under the contract name "D", as a new unit for the fleet. "Wettin" was <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> on 6 June 1901. King <a href="Albert%20of%20Saxony">Albert of Saxony</a>, a member of the <a href="House%20of%20Wettin">House of Wettin</a>, gave a speech at the ceremony. In August 1902, a crew of 60 men took the ship to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> for <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a>, which were supervised by "KAdm" <a href="Hunold%20von%20Ahlefeld">Hunold von Ahlefeld</a>. On 10 August, while at <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a> during the trials, <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> reviewed "Wettin" from his <a href="yacht">yacht</a> <a href="SMY%20Hohenzollern">"Hohenzollern"</a>. "Wettin" was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 1 October 1902, the first member of her class to enter service. Further sea trials were completed by January 1903 and she joined I Squadron, replacing the battleship . That year, the squadron was occupied with the normal peacetime routine of individual and unit training. This included a training cruise in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> followed by a voyage to Spain from 7 May to 10 June. In July, she embarked on the annual cruise to Norway with the rest of the squadron. The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, a cruise of the entire fleet to Norwegian waters, and a mock attack on Kiel ending on 12 September. The year's training schedule concluded with a cruise into the eastern Baltic that started on 23 November and a cruise into the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> that began on 1 December.

"Wettin" and I Squadron participated in an exercise in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904 and a further squadron exercise from 8 to 17 March. A major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May. In July, I Squadron and <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> visited Britain, including a stop at <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on 10 July. The German ships sailed for the Netherlands on 13 July. I Squadron anchored in <a href="Vlissingen">Vlissingen</a> the following day, where they were visited by Queen <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Wilhelmina</a>. The squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July, when it departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet. The squadron stopped in <a href="Molde">Molde</a>, Norway, on 29 July, while the other units went to other ports. The fleet reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August. During its cruise in the North Sea, the fleet experimented with <a href="wireless%20telegraphy">wireless telegraphy</a> on a large scale and with searchlights for night communication and recognition signals. Immediately after returning to Kiel, the fleet began preparations for the autumn maneuvers in the Baltic, which began on 29 August. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September and took part in a major <a href="amphibious%20warfare">landing operation</a>. The ships then embarked <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">IX Corps</a> ground troops that had participated in the exercises, transporting them to <a href="Altona%2C%20Hamburg">Altona</a> for a parade before Wilhelm II. On 6 September, the ships conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a>. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a>, where it participated in further landing operations with the IX Corps and the <a href="Guards%20Corps%20%28German%20Empire%29">Guards Corps</a>. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end. I Squadron went on its winter training cruise, this time to the eastern Baltic from 22 November to 2 December.

"Wettin" took part in training cruises with I Squadron from 9 to 19 January and 27 February to 16 March 1905. "Wettin" was sent to assist her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>, , which had run aground in the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a> on 3 March. Individual and squadron training followed, with an emphasis on gunnery drills. On 12 July, the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea. It then cruised through the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> and stopped at <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. The summer cruise ended on 9 August. The autumn maneuvers would normally have followed shortly thereafter but were delayed by a visit from the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> that month. The British fleet stopped in Danzig, Swinemünde, and <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>, where it was greeted by units of the German Navy. "Wettin" and the main German fleet were anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit was strained by the <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">Anglo-German naval arms race</a>, and the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably, to just a week of exercises in the North Sea in early September. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>; the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>. In October, I Squadron went on a cruise in the Baltic. In early December, I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. On the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.

The fleet undertook a heavier training schedule in 1906 than in previous years. The ships were occupied with individual, division and squadron exercises throughout April. Starting on 13 May, major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June, with a cruise around the <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a> into the Baltic. The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid-July and was present for the birthday of Norwegian King, <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">Haakon VII</a>, on 3 August. The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland, to join exercises being conducted there. The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August, where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began. Between 22 and 24 August, the fleet took part in landing exercises in <a href="Eckernf%C3%B6rde%20Bay">Eckernförde Bay</a>, outside Kiel. The maneuvers were paused on 31 August, when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden, which departed on 3 September. That same day, a Russian squadron visited in Kiel, remaining there until 9 September. The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days.

The ship participated in the uneventful winter cruise into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December. The first quarter of 1907 followed the previous pattern. On 16 February, the Active Battle Fleet was re-designated the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>. From the end of May to early June, the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea, returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat. This was followed by the regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August. During the autumn maneuvers from 26 August to 6 September, the fleet conducted landing exercises in northern <a href="Schleswig">Schleswig</a> with the IX Corps. The winter training cruise went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November. In May 1908, the fleet went on a major cruise into the Atlantic instead of its normal voyage in the North Sea. Stops included <a href="Horta%2C%20Azores">Horta</a>, in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>. The fleet returned to Kiel on 13 August to prepare for the autumn maneuvers lasting from 27 August to 7 September. Division exercises in the Baltic followed from 7 to 13 September. In early 1909, "Wettin" was rammed by the battleship . She was not damaged in the accident and was able to continue training that year. During the annual maneuvers, "Wettin" won the Kaiser's "Schießpreis" (Shooting Prize) for the best accuracy with her main battery among I Squadron ships. The year 1910 passed uneventfully for "Wettin" with a similar routine of training, exercises, and cruises as in previous years.

By the time of the training exercises conducted in April, May, and June 1911, "Wettin" was the oldest battleship still in front-line service with the fleet. On 30 June her place in the squadron was taken by the new <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> . "Wettin" was reactivated on 1 December to replace her sister ship , which needed a major overhaul after service as the fleet's gunnery <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a>. In March and April 1912, "Wettin", the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> , and the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s and were temporarily transferred from the artillery school to the Training Squadron. In August, "Wettin" was transferred from the artillery school to III Squadron where she took part in the annual fleet maneuvers.

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August 1914, "Wettin" was mobilized into <a href="IV%20Battle%20Squadron">IV Battle Squadron</a> under the command of "VAdm" <a href="Ehrhard%20Schmidt">Ehrhard Schmidt</a>. IV Squadron also included her four sister ships and the battleships and . On 26 August, the ships were sent to rescue the stranded light cruiser , which had run aground off the island of <a href="Odensholm">Odensholm</a> in the eastern Baltic, but the cruiser was scuttled by her crew before the relief force arrived. "Wettin" and the rest of the squadron returned to <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> that day. Starting on 3 September, IV Squadron, assisted by "Blücher", conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September but failed to bring Russian naval units to battle.

Two days later, the ships were transferred to the North Sea. They stayed there only briefly, returning to the Baltic on 20 September. From 22 to 26 September, the squadron took part in a sweep into the eastern Baltic in an unsuccessful attempt to find and destroy Russian warships. From 4 December 1914 to 2 April 1915, the ships of IV Squadron were tasked with coastal defense duties along Germany's North Sea coast, to prevent incursions by the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Ships of the squadron's VII Division, which included "Wettin", , "Schwaben", and "Mecklenburg", then participated in training exercises in the western Baltic.

The <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> requested naval assistance for its campaign against Russia. <a href="Prince%20Heinrich">Prince Heinrich</a>, the commander of all naval forces in the Baltic, made VII Division, <a href="IV%20Scouting%20Group">IV Scouting Group</a>, and the torpedo boats of the Baltic fleet available for the operation. On 6 May, the VII Division ships were tasked with providing support for the assault on <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a>. "Wettin" and the other ships were stationed off <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a> to intercept any Russian cruisers that might attempt to intervene in the landings, but the Russians took no such action. When cruisers from the IV Scouting Group encountered Russian cruisers patrolling off Gotland, ships of the VII Division deployed, mounting a third dummy <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> to disguise them as the more powerful . They were joined by the cruiser . The ships advanced as far as the island of <a href="Ut%C3%B6%20%28Finland%29">Utö</a> on 9 May and <a href="Kopparstenarna">Kopparstenarna</a> the following day, but by then the Russian cruisers had withdrawn. Later that day, the British submarines and spotted IV Squadron but were too far away to attack.

From 27 May to 4 July, "Wettin" was back in the North Sea, patrolling the mouths of the <a href="Jade%20%28river%29">Jade</a>, <a href="Ems%20%28river%29">Ems</a>, and Elbe rivers. During this period, the <a href="German%20Imperial%20Admiralty%20Staff">naval high command</a> realized that the old "Wittelsbach"-class ships would be useless in action against the Royal Navy, but could be effectively used against the much weaker Russian forces in the Baltic. Consequently, the ships were transferred back to the Baltic in July. They departed Kiel on 7 July, bound for Danzig. On 10 July, the ships arrived in <a href="Neufahrwassar">Neufahrwassar</a>, Danzig along with the VIII Torpedo-boat Flotilla. IV Squadron ships sortied into the Baltic on 12 July to make a <a href="Demonstration%20%28military%29">demonstration</a>, returning to Danzig on 21 July without encountering Russian forces.

The following month, the naval high command began an operation in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a> to support the <a href="Gorlice%E2%80%93Tarn%C3%B3w%20Offensive">Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive</a> that the Army was waging. The Baltic naval forces were reinforced with significant elements of the High Seas Fleet, including <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Battle Squadron</a>, I Scouting Group, <a href="II%20Scouting%20Group">II Scouting Group</a>, and II Torpedo-boat Flotilla. Prince Heinrich planned that Schmidt's ships would force their way into the Gulf and destroy the Russian warships at <a href="Riga">Riga</a>, while the heavy units of the High Seas Fleet would patrol to the north to prevent interference by the main Russian <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a>. The Germans launched their attack on 8 August, initiating the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">Battle of the Gulf of Riga</a>. <a href="Minesweeper">Minesweeper</a>s attempted to clear a path through the <a href="Irbe%20Strait">Irbe Strait</a>, covered by "Braunschweig" and "Elsass", while "Wettin" and the rest of the squadron remained outside the strait. The Russian battleship attacked the Germans in the strait, forcing them to withdraw.

During the action, the cruiser and the torpedo boat were damaged by <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a>. The torpedo boats and were mined and sunk. Schmidt withdrew his ships to re-coal. Prince Heinrich debated making another attempt, as the German Army's advance toward Riga had stalled. Nevertheless, Prince Heinrich tried to force the channel a second time with two dreadnought battleships from I Squadron to cover the minesweepers. "Wettin" was left at Libau largely due to the scarcity of escorts. Increased activity by British submarines forced the Germans to employ more destroyers to protect their capital ships.

On 9 September 1915, "Wettin" and her four sisters sortied in an attempt to locate Russian warships off Gotland, but returned to port two days later without having engaged any opponents. By this point in the war, the Navy was encountering difficulties in manning more important vessels. Additionally, the threat from submarines in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly "Wittelsbach"-class ships from active service. "Wettin" and most of the other IV Squadron ships left Libau on 10 November, bound for Kiel. Arriving the next day, they were designated the Reserve Division of the Baltic, commanded by "<a href="Kommodore">Kommodore</a>" (Commodore) <a href="Walter%20Engelhardt">Walter Engelhardt</a>. The ships were anchored off <a href="Schilksee">Schilksee</a>, Kiel. On 31 January 1916, the division was dissolved, and the ships were dispersed for subsidiary duties.

"Wettin" was used as a training ship for <a href="naval%20cadet">naval cadet</a>s and as a depot ship for the remainder of the war. The ship was stricken from the <a href="naval%20register">naval register</a> on 11 March 1920 and sold to ship breakers on 21 November 1921. "Wettin" was <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for scrap the following year in <a href="R%C3%B6nnebeck">Rönnebeck</a>, a part of <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a>.

History of Baltimore City College

The history of The Baltimore City College began in March 1839, when the <a href="Baltimore%20City%20Council">City Council</a> of <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, Maryland, United States, passed a resolution mandating the creation of a male high school with a focus on the study of English and <a href="classical%20literature">classical literature</a>. "The High School" (later becoming <a href="Baltimore%20City%20College">The Baltimore City College</a>) was opened later in the same year on October 20, with 46 pupils under the direction of Professor <a href="Nathan%20C.%20Brooks">Nathan C. Brooks</a>,(1809-1898), a local noted classical educator and poet, who became the first principal of a new type of higher institution in the developing public education system in the city begun in 1829. It is now considered to be the third oldest public <a href="high%20school">high school</a> / <a href="secondary%20school">secondary school</a> in the nation. In 1850, the <a href="Baltimore%20City%20Council">Baltimore City Council</a> granted the school, then known as the "Central High School of Baltimore", the authority to present its graduates with certificates of completion. An effort to expand that academic power and allow the then named "Central High School of Baltimore" to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees began following the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> in 1865, and continued the following year with the renaming of the institution as "The Baltimore City College", which it still holds to this day, with also the retitling of its chief academic officer from "<a href="principal%20%28academia%29">principal</a>" to "<a href="college%20president">president</a>", along with an increase in the number of years of its course of study and the expansion of its courses. However, despite this early elevation effort, it ended at that brief period unsuccessfully in 1869, although the B.C.C. continued for a number of years as a hybrid public high school and early form of <a href="junior%20college">junior college</a> (later known as <a href="community%20college">community college</a>) which did not fully appear in America in different form until the beginning of the 20th century. Very often the elaborate decorative fancy engraved graduation diploma from the B.C.C. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was accepted by many other colleges and universities entitling City graduates to enter upper-division schools at the sophomore year, (which was also coincidentally a privilege also accorded to its later local academic and athletic rival for 127 years - "Poly", the <a href="Baltimore%20Polytechnic%20Institute">Baltimore Polytechnic Institute</a>, founded 1883 as the Baltimore Manual Training School, later renamed 1893).

As the importance of higher education increased in the early 20th century, the High School's priorities shifted to preparing students for college. In 1927, only one year before the school moved from its home at Howard and Centre Streets for 53 years to the magnificent stone "Castle on the Hill" on "Collegian Hill", the academic program was further changed, when the City College divided its curriculum into two tracks: the standard college preparatory program, or "'B' Course", and a more rigorous stiff "Advanced College Prep" curriculum, the famed "'A' Course" of study focusing on humanities, social studies, liberal arts and the Classics. (also available in the mathematics/science/technology fields in a more structured form with little options/electives at <a href="Baltimore%20Polytechnic%20Institute">"Poly"</a> and at <a href="Western%20High%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">Western</a> and <a href="Eastern%20High%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">Eastern High Schools</a> for girls).

The school underwent major demographic changes following the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a>'s unanimous ruling in the May 1954 decision ""<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas</a>"" case that called for an end to <a href="racial%20segregation">racial segregation</a>. African Americans joined City College for the first time at the end of that summer, in September 1954 and became a significant proportion of the student population by the 1960s, with over half black by 1966, reflecting similar trends in the city itself. Mr. Pierre H. Davis, also later became the first "Negro"/"Colored" teacher to join the B.C.C. faculty the following year of 1955 for only one year in the Business Education Department, along with Eugene Parker in the Physical Education Department, who went on becoming head basketball coach for three decades. Mr. Davis, coincidentally returned 15 years later to become the first Afro-American principal of the City College in September 1970. The school saw further changes in the student population with the admission of women in 1978.

Academic standards and enrollment numbers at the Baltimore City College (B.C.C.) after reaching a high of near 4,000 boys by the mid-1960s went through a period of decline first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s, with the rapid opening of newer additional high schools both in the outreaches of the city along with the rapidly expanding suburbs in surrounding <a href="Baltimore%20County">Baltimore County</a>. Two in the city system were <a href="Northwestern%20High%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">Northwestern</a> in 1965 and <a href="Northern%20High%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">Northern</a> in the following year. Three high schools were completed and opened all at one time in September 1971, with <a href="Southwestern%20High%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">Southwestern</a>, <a href="Walbrook%20High%20School">Walbrook</a> and a massive huge complex nearby to City in <a href="Clifton%20Park%2C%20Baltimore">Clifton Park</a> on the bed of the old reservoir off Harford Road, <a href="Lake%20Clifton%20High%20School">Lake Clifton</a>. The 'A' and 'B' courses were slowly dying out and unfortunately discontinued by 1973, and a single academic track was offered.

After another period of neglect in the late 1980s after the decade long stimulating and long leadership of the "New City College" program, curriculum and admissions standards under Principal Solomon Lausch, by the early 1990s, to the mid-1990s, with an increase in funding from the <a href="Baltimore%20City%20Public%20Schools">BCPS school system</a>, and the selection of the high school to be one of the few to sub-contract out its maintenance and support functions to the Educational Alternatives, Inc. private system (E.A.I.) who were already academically operating and running several other city elementary and middle schools under an experimental but controversial contract with the <a href="Baltimore%20City%20Public%20Schools">BCPS</a> and the School Board. The B.C.C. began to experience a turnaround under new principal and former attorney, Dr. Joseph Wilson brought in during 1994 after a nationwide job search. Administrators re-strengthened academic standards and, in 1998, the school began offering the <a href="IB%20Diploma">International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program</a>. By the beginning of the decade of the 2000s, City College was experiencing an academic resurgence. During this period the school was recognized by the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Education">U.S. Department of Education</a> as a <a href="National%20Blue%20Ribbon%20School">National Blue Ribbon School</a>, was listed as one of the top high schools in the United States by "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" magazine.

The creation of a male high school "in which the higher branches of English and classical literature should be taught exclusively" was authorized unanimously by the <a href="Baltimore%20City%20Council">Baltimore City Council</a> on March 7, 1839. A townhouse of probably two stories with a sloped roof and dormer window structure on what was then known as Courtland Street (now east side of "<a href="James%20H.%20Preston">Preston Gardens</a>", built in the late 1910s with terraced and bermed flower beds with shrubs and monumental staircases along St. Paul Street and St. Paul Place, of five square blocks between East Centre Street in the north and East Lexington Street to the south, as Baltimore's first downtown "<a href="urban%20renewal">urban renewal</a>" project, which unfortunately resulted in the razing of hundreds of beautiful, but run-down, then neglected <a href="Federal%20architecture">Federal</a>, <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a>, and <a href="Greek%20Revival">Greek Revival architecture</a>-styled townhomes and classical business structures that would be considered to be saved under the "historic preservation" standards today) was acquired to serve as the home of the new high school. The school opened its doors that Fall on October 20, 1839 with 46 students. Enrollment was restricted to <a href="White%20people">white</a>, male students of Baltimore City who had completed <a href="grammar%20school">grammar school</a> and passed an entrance exam. Additional student applicants from the surrounding rural (and later suburban) <a href="Baltimore%20County">Baltimore County</a> and <a href="Anne%20Arundel%20County">Anne Arundel County</a> were considered upon payment of tuition to the <a href="Baltimore%20City%20Public%20Schools">Baltimore City Public Schools</a> system Those enrolled were offered two academic tracks, a <a href="classical%20literature">classical literature</a> track and an <a href="English%20literature">English literature</a> track. The sole instructor for both tracks was the educator and poet, <a href="Nathan%20C.%20Brooks">Nathan C. Brooks</a>, who also served as <a href="Principal%20%28school%29">principal</a>. To accommodate the two tracks, Brooks split the school day into two sections: one in the morning from 9 am to 12 am, and another in the afternoon from 2 pm to 5 pm. During the morning session, students studied either classics or English; however, the afternoon was devoted to English.

In its first three years, the school was housed in many locations before returning to the original townhouse building on Courtland Street. In 1843, the <a href="Baltimore%20City%20Council">City Council</a> allocated $23,000 to acquire a building for the school at the northeastern corner of East Fayette and Holliday Streets, (across the street from the later <a href="Baltimore%20City%20Hall">Baltimore City Hall</a>, constructed 1867-1875), and the site of the present <a href="War%20Memorial%20Plaza">War Memorial Plaza</a>, constructed 1917-1925). The renovated new school building was the former old "Assembly Rooms", a <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival architecture</a> civic landmark, built in 1797 by <a href="architecture">architects</a> <a href="Robert%20Cary%20Long%2C%20Jr.">Robert Cary Long, Sr.</a> and Col. Nicholas Rogers (ancestor owner of the estate which became <a href="Druid%20Hill%20Park">Druid Hill Park</a>) to accommodate social events for Baltimore's social elite at the Baltimore Dancing Assembly, which had begun in the 1780s. and the site of the first private library company of Baltimore. The school was next door to the famous <a href="Holliday%20Street%20Theatre">Holliday Street Theatre</a>, where the poem "The Defence of Fort McHenry", now known as the ""<a href="Star%20Spangled%20Banner">Star Spangled Banner</a>"" written by <a href="Frederick%2C%20Maryland">Frederick</a> and <a href="Georgetown%2C%20D.C.">Georgetown</a> lawyer and amateur poet, <a href="Francis%20Scott%20Key">Francis Scott Key</a>, (1779-1843), was first performed on its stage in October and November 1814, following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Baltimore">Battle of Baltimore</a>, with the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and <a href="British%20Army">Army</a> attack on Baltimore during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, (now known as "<a href="Defenders%20Day">Defenders' Day</a>") on September 12-13-14, 1814. Although it was not designed to house an academic institution, the school would occupy this building for 30 years.

The male high school for Baltimore went through the first of a series of name changes in 1844. First known and founded in 1839 as "The High School", it was renamed the "Male High School" because of the establishment of two schools for females — <a href="Eastern%20High%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">Eastern</a> and <a href="Western%20High%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">Western High Schools</a>, which opened in November of that year.

In 1849, after a decade of service, Prof. <a href="Nathan%20C.%20Brooks">Brooks</a> resigned as principal of the school, which had now grown to include 232 students and 7 teachers, excluding Brooks. Rev. Dr. <a href="Francis%20G.%20Waters">Francis G. Waters</a>, who had been the president of the <a href="Washington%20College">Washington College</a>, on the <a href="Eastern%20Shore%20of%20Maryland">Eastern Shore of Maryland</a> in <a href="Chestertown%2C%20Maryland">Chestertown</a>, succeeded Brooks. The following year the city council renamed the school "The Central High School of Baltimore" and granted the commissioners of the public schools the right to confer certificates to the high school's graduates. Exercising that new authority, the new C.H.S. of B. held its first <a href="graduation">commencement</a> ceremony in 1851 with noted local philosopher, author and <a href="wikt%3Acivic">civic</a> leader <a href="Severn%20Teackle%20Wallis">Severn Teackle Wallis</a>, (1816-1894), as the guest speaker, (Wallis has a bronze statue to his memory and many city accomplishments at the eastern end from the <a href="Washington%20Monument%20%28Baltimore%29">Washington Monument</a> of Mount Vernon Place/East Monument Street facing the intersection with <a href="St.%20Paul%20Street%20%28Baltimore%29">St. Paul Street</a>. This bolstered enrollment in the school, as students were drawn by the prospect of receiving a certificate attesting to their level of education. That year 156 students applied to the school—an increase of 50 students.

The growing enrollment necessitated a reorganization of the school. Under the direction of Waters, the school day was divided into eight periods lasting forty-five minutes: four sessions were held in the morning and four in the afternoon. In addition to reorganizing the schedule, he divided the courses into seven different departments: <a href="Belles-Lettres">Belles-letters</a> and history, <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="natural%20sciences">natural sciences</a>, <a href="moral%20philosophy">moral</a>, <a href="mental%20philosophy">mental</a>, and <a href="political%20science">political science</a>, <a href="Classical%20antiquity">ancient languages</a>, <a href="modern%20language">modern language</a>s and music. Each of the seven instructors was assigned to a distinct department and received the title of "professor".

In 1865, in accordance with a recommendation from the board of commissioners of the Baltimore City public schools, City College began offering a five-year track, beginning a process aimed at elevating the school to a college and allowing it to grant its graduates degrees. To further these aims, the school was renamed "The Baltimore City College" (BCC) by an act of the city council on October 9, 1866. That same year, the board of commissioners recommended that the city council make a formal proposal to the <a href="Maryland%20General%20Assembly">Maryland General Assembly</a> to grant City College the authority to confer Bachelor of Arts degrees to its graduates. According to the "38th Annual Report of the Board of Commissioners of the Public Schools to the Mayor and City Council", the elevation of the school was designed to "afford advantages to students...who may adopt the profession of teacher as a pursuit of life." Thus, the elevation was intended to provide qualified teachers for the Baltimore school system. However, the city council never acted on this recommendation and though the school changed nominally, it was never truly granted the power of a college. Not only did the city council fail to make the recommendation to the general assembly, but it also failed to adequately maintain the facilities of the school. In the "43rd Annual Report of the Board of Commissioners of the Public Schools to the Mayor and City Council", the president of the board wrote:

In addition, the president of the board again requested that the city council attempt to elevate the status of City College, "so that it shall be placed on equal footing in all respects to that of a first class collegiate institution," but no action was taken. Since there was no incentive to pursue the five-year track, no student remained at the school for the extra year of study and the course was abandoned in 1869.

It was not until 1873, when a fire spread from the Holliday Street Theatre to the "Assembly Rooms," that the city council finally decided to expend the resources to erect a new building for the school. The city council acquired a lot on Howard Street opposite Centre Street and allocated $150,000 for the construction of the new building. During the construction, City College was housed in a building of the Baltimore Female College, where it remained until its new English <a href="Gothic%20revival">Gothic revival</a>-style building was dedicated on February 1, 1875. While at the Baltimore Female College, the five-year course was reintroduced and the four-year track was eliminated. That allowed students to pursue advanced courses, which included <a href="calculus">calculus</a>, <a href="political%20economy">political economy</a>, <a href="logic">logic</a> and higher-level language courses, which were emphasized in the curriculum. Students were expected to learn <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, French, and German; and <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> was offered as an optional course.

In 1876, ceremonies were held in the adjacent Academy of Music for the new <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>, which had established several buildings alongside City College under its first president, <a href="Daniel%20Coit%20Gilman">Daniel Coit Gilman</a>. Four graduates of City College entered Hopkins as a part of the first undergraduate class. That same year BCC's academic program underwent further changes with the introduction of a one-year track, which provided an opportunity for students who could not complete the entire course of study because they needed to enter the <a href="labor%20market">labor market</a>. Courses in the one-year track focused on providing students with pragmatic skills, such as "book-keeping", "commercial arithmetic", and "business correspondence".

City College's first extracurricular activity, the <a href="Bancroft%20Literary%20Association%20and%20Carrollton-Wight%20Literary%20Society">Bancroft Literary Association</a>, was established the same year to provide a forum for student debate. A second debating society, the Carrollton Society, was established in 1878. One of the first athletic teams appeared the following year, when a group of students organized a lacrosse team—the first at a public high school.
The establishment of <a href="Baltimore%20Polytechnic%20Institute">Baltimore Polytechnic Institute</a> (Poly) in 1883 was an important development for City College's athletics program. With the founding of Poly, City College acquired an arch rival in academics and sports—particularly football. The schools have met annually in a football clash since 1889. The formal organization of an athletic program at BCC did not begin until 1895. During the early years of the athletic program, City College played chiefly against college teams because few other secondary schools existed in Maryland. City College's 1895 football schedule included <a href="St.%20John%27s%20College%20%28Annapolis/Santa%20Fe%29">St. John's College</a>, <a href="Swarthmore%20College">Swarthmore College</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20College%20Park">University of Maryland</a>, and Washington College.

City College's <a href="Tudor%20style%20architecture">Tudor</a> and <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a>-style building, designed by Baltimore City Hall architect George A Frederick, lasted until 1892, when it was undermined by the construction of the <a href="Baltimore%20%26amp%3B%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore & Ohio Railroad</a> tunnel from Camden Station to Mount Royal Station, and collapsed. Several years of political in-fighting and the change to a <a href="reformist">reformist</a> city administration delayed construction of a new structure. Designed by the architects Baldwin and Pennington, the new structure was not completed until 1899.

The succeeding year, the only time since 1851, the school did not hold a commencement. Members of the senior class had decided to make fun of the professors in the "Green Bag"—City College's year book since 1896. When the school board was alerted of the matter, it attempted to censor the edition, passing a resolution requiring the "Green Bag" to be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper. However, the year book had already been printed, and the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. The school board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors of the "Green Bag" and the business manager, and by preventing the school from holding a commencement ceremony. One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, became a member of the school board in 1926.

In 1901, the course of study at City College went through a series of further changes. The most significant was the reduction of the five-year course of study to four years; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five-year course. The new course, like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose their courses, as long as they completed 150 credits.

The program's explicit purpose was to provide special preparation for those wishing to attend college because of the increasing significance of college education. Though specific classes were not required, to meet the goal, students were required to complete courses in <a href="English%20literature">English literature</a> and <a href="Composition%20%28language%29">composition</a>, four foreign languages, mathematics, science, history, commerce, drawing, music, and physical culture.

By <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, attendance in the school was rapidly increasing. An annex was added on 26th Street to alleviate overcrowding in the Howard Street building, but it was insufficient. Therefore, during the 1920s, alumni began campaigning to provide a proper building for the school, and in 1926, ground was broken for a massive Collegiate <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> stone castle with a 38-acre (153,781 m²) campus, on a hill in the newly annexed northeastern suburbs at <a href="33rd%20Street%20%28Baltimore%29">33rd Street</a> and <a href="The%20Alameda%20%28Baltimore%29">The Alameda</a>. The four-level "Castle on the Hill", which was surmounted by a 150 ft (46 m) tower and designed by architects Buckler and Fenhagen, cost almost $3,000,000 and accommodated 2,500 students. The "castle" featured arched windows and <a href="cornice%20%28architecture%29">cornices</a>, <a href="cloisters">cloisters</a>, <a href="gargoyle">gargoyle</a>s, <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a>, <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> paneling, <a href="plaster">plaster</a> arches, <a href="chandelier">chandelier</a>s and <a href="terra%20cotta">terra cotta</a> tiles and <a href="terrazzo">terrazzo</a> floors with two courtyards and plans for additional wings and buildings.

The following year, in 1927, the "Advanced Academic Course" ("A" Course) was introduced. Students in the "A" Course were able to enter their second year of college following their graduation. This program of study and its counterpart, the college preparatory course ("B" Course), became the backbone of City College's academic program for over 60 years. On April 10, 1928, after nearly two years of construction, "The Castle on the Hill" opened its doors to the students and faculty. The next year, the students published the first edition of "The Collegian", City College's newspaper. The publication quickly became an indispensable part of student life and gained national attention, when it won second place in a contest sponsored by the <a href="Columbia%20Scholastic%20Press%20Association">Columbia Scholastic Press Association</a> of <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>. "The Collegian" held the first place title between 1935–1939.

When Japan's attack on <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> on December 7, 1941 led to U.S. entry into <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, <a href="blood%20donor">blood donor</a> projects, stamp and bond drives, and the dedication of service flags gave the City College a wartime atmosphere. More than three-quarters of the students participated in the <a href="V%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">Victory Corps</a>, which sponsored courses in communications, map reading, judo and the study of the poisonous and non-poisonous plants on <a href="Pacific%20islands">Pacific islands</a>. By the time the war ended in 1945, 4,667 City College students had served in the <a href="U.S.%20military">armed forces</a>, 204 of whom lost their lives. The names of all of the fallen, including two <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> recipients, are inscribed on a bronze memorial, which sits today in the center of the school.

Following the landmark <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> ruling in "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>", the Baltimore City board of school commissioners was forced to <a href="Desegregation">desegregate</a> the school system, which had been racially divided since the 1860s. As a result, 10 African-American students entered City College in September 1954, comprising 0.5% of the student population. A decade later, in the 1964–65 academic year, African-American students represented 30% of the student population.

In 1956 the school system also sent two African-American men to teach at the school: Eugene Parker, who coached for thirty years, and Pierre Davis, who left after one year but returned in 1971 as City College's first African-American principal.

Although African-American enrollment increased, the transition from the segregated system was not seamless. In 1964, enrollment in the selective "A" Course still skewed disproportionately to white students. Only six African Americans were enrolled that year compared with 110 Whites, and they were similarly underrepresented in extracurricular activities.

Such <a href="De%20facto%20segregation">"de facto" segregation</a> was a systemic problem in Baltimore throughout the 1960s. To address the problem, Superintendent Laurence G. Paquin proposed a reorganization of Baltimore's high schools. He called for the creation of 13 comprehensive high schools that would offer both vocational training and college preparatory classes, and the elimination of multiple academic tracks in high school. However, Paquin's proposal met stiff opposition from City College parents and alumni, who feared that his plan threatened the foundations of City College's academic program. Councilman <a href="William%20Donald%20Schaefer">William Donald Schaefer</a>, an alumnus of City College, convened a City Council hearing on the proposal, which stymied Paquin's effort.

By the late 1970s, the school's population, academic program, and building were all in decline, in part reflecting the economic problems of the city as a whole. In 1977, the city school system allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College <a href="coeducational">coeducational</a>; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a <a href="single-sex%20education">single-sex education</a> system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11–6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing <a href="U.S.%20constitution">constitutional</a> concerns over equal rights. The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.

By 1990, the school's academic program was once again deteriorating and enrollment was declining. The <a href="Middle%20States%20Association%20of%20Colleges%20and%20Schools">Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools</a> raised questions about the ability of City College to offer students an academically rigorous course of study. During this period of decline, the "A" Course was discontinued by Principal Joseph Antenson, who contended that the program was racially discriminatory—an argument Paquin had made nearly three decades earlier—and opted for a standardized curriculum. However, the change did little to improve the school; therefore, in 1992, the school system hired a private contractor to run City College. That action was a part of the unsuccessful "Educational Alternatives program", which lasted for about 14 months. Then, in 1994, Joseph M. Wilson was appointed principal of City College. Wilson, with the aid of alumni and parents, was able to secure more funding and autonomy from the school system, which were used to redesign the curriculum and to introduce the <a href="IB%20Diploma%20Program">IB Diploma Program</a> in 1998.

The new academic program attracted increased attention to the school. In 2000, City College was recognized as a <a href="National%20Blue%20Ribbon%20School">National Blue Ribbon School</a> by the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Education">U.S. Department of Education</a>, which placed it among the best schools in the country. The following year, the Toronto "<a href="National%20Post">National Post</a>" reported on the two-month-long task of searching for the perfect high school in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. It "never found the perfect school ... [however] we found a few outstanding ones," the paper concluded. And one of these—the subject of a prominent feature article—was City College, led by Wilson. The school's rankings in "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>"'s report of the nation's top high schools improved during this period. In 2003, it was ranked 593. Three years later, in 2006, City College was ranked 206, and in 2007 it was ranked 258. Given an estimated 27,500 public high schools across the nation, in 2007 ranking placed City College in the top one percent of all high schools. In its criteria, "Newsweek" divided the number of <a href="Advanced%20Placement%20Program">Advanced Placement</a> and International Baccalaureate tests taken by the number of graduating seniors. The magazine stated that the measure showed schools which were committed to helping students take college-level courses.

In addition to the academic resurgence of the school, the building was recognized for its historical and architectural interest. The Castle on the Hill was honored in 2003 by being placed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>. This designation coincided with the 75th anniversary of the structure and campus as well as City College's 165th year of existence. On April 24, 2007 it earned the additional distinction of being listed as a Baltimore City Landmark. Mayor <a href="Sheila%20Dixon">Sheila Dixon</a> stated that: "The castle on the hill, as City College is known, is truly a historic landmark. It is worthy of preservation and acknowledgment."

The landmark status bill was passed by the city council in accordance with a recommendation made by the council's staff, which found that the building dates from a historic and architecturally significant period. This new status prevents the building's exterior from being altered without the approval of the city's Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation. However, the previous year City College was a victim of vandalism at the hands of a group of children ranging in age from 8 to 15, as a renovation of the school neared completion. In the summer of 2007, scenes from the 2008 sequel "<a href="Step%20Up%202">Step Up 2</a>" were filmed at City College. Interior and campus shots were used to form the fictional Maryland School for the Arts.

In 2007 controversy about the academic program arose, when members of the Baltimore City College Alumni Association argued that the IB Program was diverting a significant amount of the school's resources to benefit a fraction of the student population. Approximately 30 students out of 1300 were enrolled in the full IB Diploma Program at City College. Some members also argued that the rigidity of the program did not give students enough flexibility. Citing these concerns, the alumni association encouraged the school to replace the IB Program with the "A course" and expand the number of Advanced Placement courses offered. In December 2008 City announced the donation of $50,000 by alumnus H. Corbin Gwaltney '39. The founder and longtime editor of Johns Hopkins Magazine, Gwaltney's donation will benefit the modernization of City's library. This is the second largest donation by a single alumnus to the school, <a href="David%20Rubenstein">David Rubenstein</a>, founder of the <a href="Carlyle%20Group">Carlyle Group</a> donated the largest amount—$100,000 in 2006.

Shale oil extraction

Shale oil extraction is an <a href="industrial%20process">industrial process</a> for <a href="unconventional%20oil">unconventional oil</a> production. This process converts <a href="kerogen">kerogen</a> in <a href="oil%20shale">oil shale</a> into <a href="shale%20oil">shale oil</a> by <a href="pyrolysis">pyrolysis</a>, <a href="hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a>, or <a href="thermal%20dissolution">thermal dissolution</a>. The resultant shale oil is used as <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> or <a href="Upgrader">upgraded</a> to meet <a href="oil%20refinery">refinery</a> feedstock specifications by adding <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and removing <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> impurities.

Shale oil extraction is usually performed above ground ("ex situ" processing) by mining the oil shale and then treating it in <a href="chemical%20plant">processing facilities</a>. Other modern technologies perform the processing underground (on-site or "<a href="In%20situ%23Petroleum%20production">in situ</a>" processing) by applying heat and extracting the oil via <a href="oil%20well">oil well</a>s.

The earliest description of the process dates to the 10th century. In 1684, Great Britain granted the first formal extraction process patent. Extraction industries and innovations became widespread during the 19th century. The industry shrank in the mid-20th century following the discovery of large <a href="Oil%20reserves">reserves of conventional oil</a>, but high <a href="Price%20of%20petroleum">petroleum prices</a> at the beginning of the 21st century have led to renewed interest, accompanied by the development and testing of newer technologies.

As of 2010, major long-standing extraction industries are operating in <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, and <a href="PRC">China</a>. Its economic viability usually requires a lack of locally available crude oil. National <a href="energy%20security">energy security</a> issues have also played a role in its development. Critics of shale oil extraction pose questions about <a href="environmental%20management">environmental management</a> issues, such as waste disposal, extensive water use, waste water management, and air pollution.

In the 10th century, the Arabian physician <a href="Masawaih%20al-Mardini">Masawaih al-Mardini</a> (Mesue the Younger) wrote of his experiments in extracting oil from "some kind of bituminous shale". The first shale oil extraction patent was granted by the British Crown in 1684 to three people who had "found a way to extract and make great quantities of pitch, tarr, and oyle out of a sort of stone". Modern industrial extraction of shale oil originated in <a href="France">France</a> with the implementation of a process invented by <a href="Alexander%20Selligue">Alexander Selligue</a> in 1838, improved upon a decade later in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> using a process invented by <a href="James%20Young%20%28Scottish%20chemist%29">James Young</a>. During the late 19th century, plants were built in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the United States. The 1894 invention of the <a href="Pumpherston%20retort">Pumpherston retort</a>, which was much less reliant on coal heat than its predecessors, marked the separation of the <a href="oil%20shale%20industry">oil shale industry</a> from the coal industry.

China (<a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a>), Estonia, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, and <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> began extracting shale oil in the early 20th century. However, crude oil discoveries in <a href="Texas">Texas</a> during the 1920s and in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> in the mid 20th century brought most oil shale industries to a halt. In 1944, the US recommenced shale oil extraction as part of its <a href="Synthetic%20Liquid%20Fuels%20Program">Synthetic Liquid Fuels Program</a>. These industries continued until oil prices fell sharply in the 1980s. The last oil shale retort in the US, operated by <a href="Unocal%20Corporation">Unocal Corporation</a>, closed in 1991. The US program was restarted in 2003, followed by a commercial leasing program in 2005 permitting the extraction of oil shale and oil sands on federal lands in accordance with the <a href="Energy%20Policy%20Act%20of%202005">Energy Policy Act of 2005</a>.

, shale oil extraction is in operation in Estonia, Brazil, and China. In 2008, their industries produced about 930,000 <a href="metric%20tonne">metric tonne</a>s (17,700 <a href="Barrel%20%28unit%29%23Oil%20barrel">barrels</a> per day) of shale oil. Australia, the US, and Canada have tested shale oil extraction techniques via demonstration projects and are planning commercial implementation; <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> and <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a> have announced their intent to do the same. Only four processes are in commercial use: <a href="Kiviter%20process">Kiviter</a>, <a href="Galoter%20process">Galoter</a>, <a href="Fushun%20process">Fushun</a>, and <a href="Petrosix">Petrosix</a>.

Shale oil extraction process decomposes oil shale and converts its <a href="kerogen">kerogen</a> into shale oil—a <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a>-like <a href="synthetic%20crude">synthetic crude</a> oil. The process is conducted by <a href="pyrolysis">pyrolysis</a>, <a href="hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a>, or <a href="thermal%20dissolution">thermal dissolution</a>. The efficiencies of extraction processes are often evaluated by comparing their yields to the results of a <a href="Fischer%20Assay">Fischer Assay</a> performed on a sample of the shale.

The oldest and the most common extraction method involves pyrolysis (also known as "retorting" or <a href="destructive%20distillation">destructive distillation</a>). In this process, oil shale is heated in the absence of oxygen until its kerogen decomposes into condensable shale oil vapors and non-condensable <a href="Combustibility">combustible</a> <a href="oil%20shale%20gas">oil shale gas</a>. Oil vapors and oil shale gas are then collected and cooled, causing the shale oil to <a href="Condensation">condense</a>. In addition, oil shale processing produces spent oil shale, which is a solid residue. Spent shale consists of <a href="inorganic%20compound">inorganic compound</a>s (<a href="mineral">mineral</a>s) and <a href="char">char</a>—a carbonaceous residue formed from kerogen. Burning the char off the spent shale produces oil shale ash. Spent shale and shale ash can be used as ingredients in cement or brick manufacture. The composition of the oil shale may lend added value to the extraction process through the recovery of by-products, including <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>, <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>, <a href="aromatic%20compound">aromatic compound</a>s, <a href="Pitch%20%28resin%29">pitch</a>, <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a>, and <a href="wax">wax</a>es.

Heating the oil shale to pyrolysis temperature and completing the <a href="endothermic">endothermic</a> kerogen decomposition reactions require a source of energy. Some technologies burn other <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a>s such as natural gas, oil, or coal to generate this heat and experimental methods have used electricity, <a href="radio%20wave">radio wave</a>s, <a href="microwave">microwave</a>s, or <a href="Chemical%20reaction">reactive</a> fluids for this purpose. Two strategies are used to reduce, and even eliminate, external heat energy requirements: the oil shale gas and char by-products generated by pyrolysis may be burned as a source of energy, and the heat contained in hot spent oil shale and oil shale ash may be used to pre-heat the raw oil shale.

For "ex situ" processing, oil shale is crushed into smaller pieces, increasing surface area for better extraction. The temperature at which decomposition of oil shale occurs depends on the time-scale of the process. In "ex situ" retorting processes, it begins at and proceeds more rapidly and completely at higher temperatures. The amount of oil produced is the highest when the temperature ranges between . The ratio of oil shale gas to shale oil generally increases along with retorting temperatures. For a modern "in situ" process, which might take several months of heating, decomposition may be conducted at temperatures as low as . Temperatures below are preferable, as this prevents the decomposition of <a href="lime%20stone">lime stone</a> and <a href="dolomite">dolomite</a> in the rock and thereby limits <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> emissions and energy consumption.

Hydrogenation and thermal dissolution (reactive fluid processes) extract the oil using <a href="hydrogen%20donor">hydrogen donor</a>s, <a href="solvent">solvent</a>s, or a combination of these. Thermal dissolution involves the application of solvents at elevated temperatures and pressures, increasing oil output by <a href="Cracking%20%28chemistry%29">cracking</a> the dissolved organic matter. Different methods produce shale oil with different properties.

Industry analysts have created several classifications of the technologies used to extract <a href="shale%20oil">shale oil</a> from oil shale.

"By process principles": Based on the treatment of raw oil shale by heat and solvents the methods are classified as pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution.

"By location": A frequently used distinction considers whether processing is done above or below ground, and classifies the technologies broadly as "ex situ" (displaced) or "in situ" (in place). In "ex situ" processing, also known as above-ground <a href="retorting">retorting</a>, the oil shale is mined either <a href="Underground%20mining%20%28soft%20rock%29">underground</a> or <a href="surface%20mining">at the surface</a> and then transported to a processing facility. In contrast, "in situ" processing converts the kerogen while it is still in the form of an oil shale deposit, following which it is then extracted via <a href="oil%20well">oil well</a>s, where it rises in the same way as conventional crude oil. Unlike "ex situ" processing, it does not involve mining or spent oil shale disposal aboveground as spent oil shale stays underground.

"By heating method": The method of transferring heat from combustion products to the oil shale may be classified as direct or indirect. While methods that allow combustion products to contact the oil shale within the <a href="retort">retort</a> are classified as "direct", methods that burn materials external to the retort to heat another material that contacts the oil shale are described as "indirect"

"By heat carrier": Based on the material used to deliver heat energy to the oil shale, processing technologies have been classified into gas heat carrier, solid heat carrier, wall conduction, reactive fluid, and volumetric heating methods. Heat carrier methods can be sub-classified as direct or indirect.

The following table shows extraction technologies classified by heating method, heat carrier and location ("in situ" or "ex situ").

"By raw oil shale particle size": The various "ex situ" processing technologies may be differentiated by the size of the oil shale particles that are fed into the retorts. As a rule, gas heat carrier technologies process oil shale lumps varying in diameter from , while solid heat carrier and wall conduction technologies process fines which are particles less than in diameter.

"By retort orientation": "Ex-situ" technologies are sometimes classified as vertical or horizontal. Vertical retorts are usually shaft kilns where a bed of shale moves from top to bottom by gravity. Horizontal retorts are usually horizontal rotating drums or screws where shale moves from one end to the other. As a general rule, vertical retorts process lumps using a gas heat carrier, while horizontal retorts process fines using solid heat carrier.

"By complexity of technology": "In situ" technologies are usually classified either as "true in situ" processes or "modified in situ" processes. "True in situ" processes do not involve mining or crushing the oil shale. "Modified in situ" processes involve drilling and fracturing the target oil shale deposit to create voids in the deposit. The voids enable a better flow of gases and fluids through the deposit, thereby increasing the volume and quality of the shale oil produced.

Internal combustion technologies burn materials (typically char and oil shale gas) within a vertical shaft retort to supply heat for pyrolysis. Typically raw oil shale particles between and in size are fed into the top of the retort and are heated by the rising hot gases, which pass through the descending oil shale, thereby causing decomposition of the kerogen at about . Shale oil mist, evolved gases and cooled combustion gases are removed from the top of the retort then moved to separation equipment. Condensed shale oil is collected, while non-condensable gas is recycled and used to carry heat up the retort. In the lower part of the retort, air is injected for the combustion which heats the spent oil shale and gases to between and . Cold recycled gas may enter the bottom of the retort to cool the shale ash. The Union A and Superior Direct processes depart from this pattern. In the Union A process, oil shale is fed through the bottom of the retort and a pump moves it upward. In the Superior Direct process, oil shale is processed in a horizontal, segmented, doughnut-shaped <a href="traveling-grate%20retort">traveling-grate retort</a>.

Internal combustion technologies such as the <a href="Paraho%20process">Paraho Direct</a> are <a href="thermal%20efficiency">thermally efficient</a>, since combustion of char on the spent shale and heat recovered from the shale ash and evolved gases can provide all the heat requirements of the retort. These technologies can achieve 80-90% of Fischer assay yield. Two well-established shale oil industries use internal combustion technologies: Kiviter process facilities have been operated continuously in Estonia since the 1920s, and a number of Chinese companies operate <a href="Fushun%20process">Fushun process</a> facilities.

Common drawbacks of internal combustion technologies are that the combustible oil shale gas is diluted by combustion gases and particles smaller than can not be processed. Uneven distribution of gas across the retort can result in blockages when hot spots cause particles to fuse or disintegrate.

Hot recycled solids technologies deliver heat to the oil shale by recycling hot solid particles—typically oil shale ash. These technologies usually employ <a href="rotary%20kiln">rotating kiln</a> or <a href="fluidized%20bed">fluidized bed</a> retorts, fed by fine oil shale particles generally having a diameter of less than ; some technologies use particles even smaller than . The recycled particles are heated in a separate chamber or vessel to about and then mixed with the raw oil shale to cause the shale to decompose at about . Oil vapour and shale oil gas are separated from the solids and cooled to condense and collect the oil. Heat recovered from the combustion gases and shale ash may be used to dry and preheat the raw oil shale before it is mixed with the hot recycle solids.

In the <a href="Galoter%20process">Galoter</a> and <a href="Enefit%20process">Enefit</a> processes, the spent oil shale is burnt in a separate furnace and the resulting hot ash is separated from the combustion gas and mixed with oil shale particles in a rotating kiln. Combustion gases from the furnace are used to dry the oil shale in a dryer before mixing with hot ash. The <a href="TOSCO%20II%20process">TOSCO II process</a> uses <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a> balls instead of shale ash as the hot recycled solids. The distinguishing feature of the <a href="Alberta%20Taciuk%20Process">Alberta Taciuk Process</a> (ATP) is that the entire process occurs in a single rotating multi–chamber horizontal vessel.

Because the hot recycle solids are heated in a separate furnace, the oil shale gas from these technologies is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas. Another advantage is that there is no limit on the smallest particles that the retort can process, thus allowing all the crushed feed to be used. One disadvantge is that more water is used to handle the resulting finer shale ash.

These technologies transfer heat to the oil shale by conducting it through the retort wall. The shale feed usually consists of fine particles. Their advantage lies in the fact that retort vapors are not combined with combustion exhaust. The <a href="Combustion%20Resources">Combustion Resources</a> process uses a hydrogen–fired rotating kiln, where hot gas is circulated through an outer <a href="Annulus%20%28oil%20well%29">annulus</a>. The <a href="Ambre%20Energy">Oil-Tech</a> staged electrically heated retort consists of individual inter-connected heating chambers, stacked atop each other. Its principal advantage lies in its <a href="modular%20design">modular design</a>, which enhances its portability and adaptability. The <a href="Red%20Leaf%20Resources">Red Leaf Resources</a> EcoShale In-Capsule Process combines surface mining with a lower-temperature heating method similar to "in situ" processes by operating within the confines of an earthen structure. A hot gas circulated through parallel pipes heats the oil shale rubble. An installation within the empty space created by mining would permit rapid reclamation of the topography.
A general drawback of conduction through a wall technologies is that the retorts are more costly when scaled-up due to the resulting large amount of heat conducting walls made of high-temperature alloys.

In general, externally generated hot gas technologies are similar to internal combustion technologies in that they also process oil shale lumps in vertical shaft kilns. Significantly, though, the heat in these technologies is delivered by gases heated outside the retort vessel, and therefore the retort vapors are not diluted with combustion exhaust. The <a href="Petrosix">Petrosix</a> and <a href="Paraho%20process">Paraho Indirect</a> employ this technology. In addition to not accepting fine particles as feed, these technologies do not utilize the potential heat of combusting the char on the spent shale and thus must burn more valuable fuels. However, due to the lack of combustion of the spent shale, the oil shale does not exceed and significant carbonate mineral decomposition and subsequent CO generation can be avoided for some oil shales. Also, these technologies tend to be the more stable and easier to control than internal combustion or hot solid recycle technologies.

Kerogen is tightly bound to the shale and resists dissolution by most <a href="solvent">solvent</a>s. Despite this constraint, extraction using especially reactive fluids has been tested, including those in a <a href="Supercritical%20fluid">supercritical</a> state. Reactive fluid technologies are suitable for processing oil shales with a low hydrogen content. In these technologies, hydrogen gas (H) or hydrogen donors (chemicals that donate hydrogen during chemical reactions) react with coke <a href="Precursor%20%28chemistry%29">precursors</a> (chemical structures in the oil shale that are prone to form char during retorting but have not yet done so). Reactive fluid technologies include the <a href="Hytort%20process">IGT Hytort</a> (high-pressure H) process, donor solvent processes, and the <a href="Chattanooga%20Corporation%23Chattanooga%20Process">Chattanooga fluidized bed reactor</a>. In the IGT Hytort oil shale is processed in a high-pressure hydrogen environment. The Chattanooga process uses a <a href="fluidized%20bed%20reactor">fluidized bed reactor</a> and an associated hydrogen-fired heater for oil shale <a href="Cracking%20%28chemistry%29">thermal cracking</a> and hydrogenation. Laboratory results indicate that these technologies can often obtain significantly higher oil yields than pyrolysis processes. Drawbacks are the additional cost and complexity of hydrogen production and high-pressure retort vessels.

Several experimental tests have been conducted for the oil-shale gasification by using <a href="Plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> technologies. In these technologies, oil shale is bombarded by <a href="Radical%20%28chemistry%29">radicals</a> (<a href="ion">ion</a>s). The radicals crack kerogen <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s forming <a href="synthetic%20gas">synthetic gas</a> and oil. Air, hydrogen or <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> are used as plasma gas and processes may operate in an <a href="electrical%20arc">arc</a>, <a href="plasma%20arc">plasma arc</a>, or plasma electrolysis mode. The main benefit of these technologies is processing without using water.

"<a href="In%20situ">In situ</a>" technologies heat oil shale underground by injecting hot fluids into the rock formation, or by using linear or planar heating sources followed by <a href="Conduction%20%28heat%29">thermal conduction</a> and <a href="convection">convection</a> to distribute heat through the target area. Shale oil is then recovered through vertical wells drilled into the formation. These technologies are potentially able to extract more shale oil from a given area of land than conventional "<a href="ex%20situ">ex situ</a>" processing technologies, as the wells can reach greater depths than surface mines. They present an opportunity to recover shale oil from low-grade deposits that <a href="traditional%20mining">traditional mining</a> techniques could not extract.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> a modified "in situ" extraction process was implemented without significant success in Germany. One of the earliest successful "in situ" processes was underground gasification by electrical energy (<a href="Fredrik%20Ljungstr%C3%B6m">Ljungström</a> method)—a process exploited between 1940 and 1966 for shale oil extraction at <a href="Kumla%20Municipality">Kvarntorp</a> in Sweden. Prior to the 1980s, many variations of the "in situ" process were explored in the United States. The first modified "in situ" oil shale experiment in the United States was conducted by <a href="Occidental%20Petroleum">Occidental Petroleum</a> in 1972 at Logan Wash, Colorado. Newer technologies are being explored that use a variety of heat sources and heat delivery systems.

Wall conduction "in situ" technologies use heating elements or heating pipes placed within the oil shale formation. The <a href="Shell%20in%20situ%20conversion%20process">Shell in situ conversion process</a> (Shell ICP) uses electrical <a href="heating%20element">heating element</a>s for heating the oil shale layer to between over a period of approximately four years. The processing area is isolated from surrounding <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> by a freeze wall consisting of wells filled with a circulating super-chilled fluid. Disadvantages of this process are large electrical power consumption, extensive water use, and the risk of <a href="groundwater%20pollution">groundwater pollution</a>. The process was tested since the early 1980s at the Mahogany test site in the <a href="Piceance%20Basin">Piceance Basin</a>. of oil were extracted in 2004 at a testing area.

In the CCR Process proposed by <a href="American%20Shale%20Oil">American Shale Oil</a>, <a href="superheated%20steam">superheated steam</a> or another heat transfer medium is circulated through a series of pipes placed below the oil shale layer to be extracted. The system combines horizontal wells, through which steam is passed, and vertical wells, which provide both vertical heat transfer through <a href="reflux">reflux</a>ing of converted shale oil and a means to collect the produced hydrocarbons. Heat is supplied by combustion of natural gas or <a href="propane">propane</a> in the initial phase and by oil shale gas at a later stage.

The Geothermic Fuels Cells Process (IEP GFC) proposed by <a href="Independent%20Energy%20Partners">Independent Energy Partners</a> extracts shale oil by exploiting a high-temperature stack of <a href="fuel%20cell">fuel cell</a>s. The cells, placed in the oil shale formation, are fueled by natural gas during a warm-up period and afterward by oil shale gas generated by its own <a href="waste%20heat">waste heat</a>.

Externally generated hot gas "in situ" technologies use hot gases heated above-ground and then injected into the oil shale formation. The <a href="Chevron%20CRUSH">Chevron CRUSH</a> process, which was researched by <a href="Chevron%20Corporation">Chevron Corporation</a> in partnership with <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>, injects heated carbon dioxide into the formation via drilled wells and to heat the formation through a series of horizontal fractures through which the gas is circulated. General Synfuels International has proposed the <a href="Omnishale%20process">Omnishale process</a> involving injection of super-heated air into the oil shale formation. <a href="Mountain%20West%20Energy">Mountain West Energy</a>'s In Situ Vapor Extraction process uses similar principles of injection of high-temperature gas.

<a href="ExxonMobil">ExxonMobil</a>'s "in situ" technology (<a href="ExxonMobil%20Electrofrac">ExxonMobil Electrofrac</a>) uses electrical heating with elements of both wall conduction and volumetric heating methods. It injects an electrically conductive material such as <a href="calcined%20petroleum%20coke">calcined petroleum coke</a> into the <a href="Hydraulic%20fracturing">hydraulic fractures</a> created in the oil shale formation which then forms a heating element. Heating wells are placed in a parallel row with a second horizontal well intersecting them at their toe. This allows opposing electrical charges to be applied at either end.

The <a href="Illinois%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> developed the concept of oil shale volumetric heating using <a href="radio%20waves">radio waves</a> (radio frequency processing) during the late 1970s. This technology was further developed by <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>. Oil shale is heated by vertical <a href="electrode%20array">electrode array</a>s. Deeper volumes could be processed at slower heating rates by installations spaced at tens of meters. The concept presumes a radio frequency at which the <a href="skin%20depth">skin depth</a> is many tens of meters, thereby overcoming the thermal diffusion times needed for conductive heating. Its drawbacks include intensive electrical demand and the possibility that groundwater or char would absorb undue amounts of the energy. Radio frequency processing in conjunction with critical fluids is being developed by <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a> together with CF Technologies and tested by <a href="Schlumberger">Schlumberger</a>.

Microwave heating technologies are based on the same principles as radio wave heating, although it is believed that radio wave heating is an improvement over microwave heating because its energy can penetrate farther into the oil shale formation. The microwave heating process was tested by <a href="Global%20Resource%20Corporation">Global Resource Corporation</a>. Electro-Petroleum proposes electrically <a href="enhanced%20oil%20recovery">enhanced oil recovery</a> by the passage of <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a> between <a href="cathode">cathode</a>s in producing wells and <a href="anode">anode</a>s located either at the surface or at depth in other wells. The passage of the current through the oil shale formation results in resistive <a href="Joule%20heating">Joule heating</a>.

The dominant question for shale oil production is under what conditions shale oil is economically viable. According to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">United States Department of Energy</a>, the capital costs of a "ex-situ" processing complex are $3–10 billion. The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the shale-oil production cost in a given region is lower than the price of petroleum or its other substitutes. According to a survey conducted by the <a href="RAND%20Corporation">RAND Corporation</a>, the cost of producing shale oil at a hypothetical surface retorting complex in the United States (comprising a mine, retorting plant, <a href="upgrader">upgrading plant</a>, supporting utilities, and spent oil shale reclamation), would be in a range of $70–95 per barrel ($440–600/m), adjusted to 2005 values. Assuming a gradual increase in output after the start of commercial production, the analysis projects a gradual reduction in processing costs to $30–40 per barrel ($190–250/m) after achieving the milestone of . The United States Department of Energy estimates that the "ex-situ" processing would be economic at sustained average world oil prices above $54 per barrel and "in-situ" processing would be economic at prices above $35 per barrel. These estimates assume a return rate of 15%. <a href="Royal%20Dutch%20Shell">Royal Dutch Shell</a> announced in 2006 that its Shell ICP technology would realize a profit when crude oil prices are higher than $30 per barrel ($190/m), while some technologies at full-scale production assert profitability at oil prices even lower than $20 per barrel ($130/m).

To increase the efficiency of oil shale retorting and by this the viability of the shale oil production, researchers have proposed and tested several co-pyrolysis processes, in which other materials such as <a href="biomass">biomass</a>, <a href="peat">peat</a>, waste <a href="bitumen">bitumen</a>, or <a href="rubber">rubber</a> and <a href="plastic">plastic</a> wastes are retorted along with the oil shale. Some modified technologies propose combining a fluidized bed retort with a circulated fluidized bed furnace for burning the by-products of pyrolysis (char and oil shale gas) and thereby improving oil yield, increasing throughput, and decreasing retorting time.

Other ways of improving the economics of shale oil extraction could be to increase the size of the operation to achieve <a href="economies%20of%20scale">economies of scale</a>, use oil shale that is a by-product of coal mining such as at <a href="Fushun">Fushun</a> China, produce <a href="specialty%20chemicals">specialty chemicals</a> as by <a href="Viru%20Keemia%20Grupp">Viru Keemia Grupp</a> in Estonia, co-generate electricity from the waste heat and process high grade oil shale that yields more oil per shale processed.

A possible measure of the viability of oil shale as an energy source lies in the ratio of the energy in the extracted oil to the energy used in its mining and processing (Energy Returned on Energy Invested, or <a href="EROEI">EROEI</a>). A 1984 study estimated the EROEI of the various known oil shale deposits as varying between 0.7–13.3; Some companies and newer technologies assert an EROEI between 3 and 10. According to the World Energy Outlook 2010, the EROEI of "ex-situ" processing is typically 4 to 5 while of "in-situ" processing it may be even as low as 2.

To increase the EROEI, several combined technologies were proposed. These include the usage of process waste heat, e.g. <a href="gasification">gasification</a> or combustion of the residual carbon (char), and the usage of waste heat from other industrial processes, such as <a href="coal%20gasification">coal gasification</a> and <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> generation.

The water requirements of extraction processes are an additional economic consideration in regions where water is a scarce resource.

Mining oil shale involves a number of environmental impacts, more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining. These include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals including <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> into surface-water and groundwater, increased <a href="erosion">erosion</a>, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of <a href="Atmospheric%20particulate%20matter">particulates</a> during processing, transport, and support activities. In 2002, about 97% of air pollution, 86% of total waste and 23% of water pollution in Estonia came from the power industry, which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production.

Oil-shale extraction can damage the biological and recreational value of land and the ecosystem in the mining area. Combustion and thermal processing generate waste material. In addition, the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and combustion include <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, a <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a>. Environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale, as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels. Experimental "in situ" conversion processes and <a href="carbon%20capture%20and%20storage">carbon capture and storage</a> technologies may reduce some of these concerns in the future, but at the same time they may cause other problems, including <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> pollution. Among the water contaminants commonly associated with oil shale processing are oxygen and nitrogen heterocyclic hydrocarbons. Commonly detected examples include <a href="quinoline">quinoline</a> derivatives, <a href="pyridine">pyridine</a>, and various alkyl homologues of pyridine (<a href="picoline">picoline</a>, <a href="lutidine">lutidine</a>).

Water concerns are sensitive issues in arid regions, such as the western US and Israel's <a href="Negev">Negev Desert</a>, where plans exist to expand oil-shale extraction despite a water shortage. Depending on technology, above-ground retorting uses between one and five barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil. A 2008 programmatic <a href="environmental%20impact%20statement">environmental impact statement</a> issued by the US <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> stated that surface mining and retort operations produce of waste water per of processed oil shale. "In situ" processing, according to one estimate, uses about one-tenth as much water.
<a href="environmentalism">Environmental</a> activists, including members of <a href="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a>, have organized strong protests against the oil shale industry. In one result, <a href="Queensland%20Energy%20Resources">Queensland Energy Resources</a> put the proposed <a href="Stuart%20Oil%20Shale%20Project">Stuart Oil Shale Project</a> in Australia on hold in 2004.

Interstate 80 Business (West Wendover, Nevada–Wendover, Utah)

Interstate 80 Business (BL-80) is an unofficial <a href="business%20route">business loop</a> of <a href="Interstate%2080">Interstate 80</a> (I-80) that is long and serves as the main street for the US cities of <a href="West%20Wendover%2C%20Nevada">West Wendover</a>, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, and <a href="Wendover%2C%20Utah">Wendover</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, along a roadway named Wendover Boulevard. Wendover Boulevard was originally part of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040">U.S. Route 40</a> (US 40), which connected <a href="California">California</a> to <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> via Nevada and Utah. A portion of the Nevada segment <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">is concurrent</a> with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2093%20Alternate%20%28Nevada%29">U.S. Route 93 Alternate</a> (US 93 Alt.), and the entire portion in Utah is <a href="wiktionary%3Acoterminous">coterminous</a> with Utah State Route 58 (SR-58). The <a href="Nevada%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Nevada Department of Transportation</a> (Nevada DOT) applied for the business loop designation in the early 1980s but the designation has never been approved; nevertheless, signs are posted in both states. Between July 1976 and 1993, BL-80 was concurrent with State Route 224 (SR 224) in Nevada.

Starting at the easternmost Nevada exit of I-80, BL-80 heads south, concurrent with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2093%20Alternate%20%28Nevada%29">US 93 Alt.</a> until it intersects with, and turns east onto, Wendover Boulevard. Just west of the intersection, the highway passes the West Wendover City Hall, which houses the West Wendover Municipal Court and Eastline Justice Court. Traveling east along Wendover Boulevard, BL-80 passes by the <a href="Wendover%20Peppermill">Peppermill</a> casino, the West Wendover Visitors Center and Scobie Park. US 93 Alt. turns south towards <a href="Ely%2C%20Nevada">Ely</a>, while BL-80 continues east until it reaches the <a href="Montego%20Bay%20Resort">Montego Bay Resort</a> and <a href="Wendover%20Nugget">Wendover Nugget</a> casinos. The casinos are connected via a <a href="skyway">sky bridge</a> that allows pedestrian access between the hotels without crossing the highway. A line painted on the street marks the Nevada–Utah border. At the border, BL-80 becomes coterminous with Utah State Route 58 for the final stretch through Wendover, Utah.

BL-80 continues to the east past Aria Boulevard, which to the north connects to I-80, and to the south leads to the historic <a href="Wendover%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wendover Air Force Base</a>, where the <a href="509th%20Composite%20Group">509th Composite Group</a> was stationed while it prepared to conduct atomic bomb attacks against Japan during 1944 and 1945. The highway briefly parallels the <a href="Shafter%20Subdivision">Shafter Subdivision</a> of the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a>'s <a href="Central%20Corridor%20%28Union%20Pacific%20Railroad%29">Central Corridor</a>, which was formerly part of the <a href="Feather%20River%20Route">Feather River Route</a> of the <a href="Western%20Pacific%20Railroad">Western Pacific Railroad</a>. As the highway travels east towards a <a href="Interchange%20%28road%29%23Two-way%20interchanges">half trumpet interchange</a> with I-80, the number of lanes drops from five to two. Traffic from BL-80 can access eastbound I-80 or turn off onto Frontage Road; however, to access westbound I-80, travelers must continue eastbound until the next exit and turn around. Traffic into Wendover can access BL-80 from both directions of I-80, and from Frontage Road.

The Utah segment of BL-80 is codified into Utah law as Utah Code §72-4-111. Every year, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average annual daily traffic</a> (AADT), which is a measure of average traffic volume for any day of the year. In 2009, UDOT calculated that an average of 2,370 vehicles per day traveled on BL-80 at the state line. This is a significant decrease from the traffic counts earlier in the decade, which measured 11,205 vehicles in 2006, 10,345 in 2005, and 13,840 in 2004. Twenty-one percent of this traffic consists of trucks.

A roadway, now named Wendover Boulevard, has existed since June 23, 1925, when the <a href="Victory%20Highway">Victory Highway</a> was completed through Wendover. Then governors <a href="George%20H.%20Dern">George H. Dern</a> of Utah and <a href="James%20G.%20Scrugham">James G. Scrugham</a> of Nevada, as well as the Secretary of Agriculture <a href="William%20M.%20Jardine">William M. Jardine</a> were present to open the highway. Bill Smith and Herman Eckstein opened a filling station at the present location of the Wendover Nugget Casino at a cost of $500 early in 1926 (equivalent to $ in ). To welcome travelers to his station, he installed a light bulb at the top of a tall pole, which served as the only light in the desert. The earlier <a href="Lincoln%20Highway">Lincoln Highway</a> was re-routed to follow the Victory Highway through the region by an order of the Lincoln Highway Association executive committee on October 18, 1926.

Wendover Boulevard was numbered <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040">US 40</a> through what are now the cities of West Wendover and Wendover beginning in 1926. US 40 was the major thoroughfare between San Francisco, in the west, and <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>, in the east. US 40 was routed along the <a href="Wendover%20Cut-off">Wendover Cut-off</a>, now known as Frontage Road, which was retained as a service road after the completion of the I-80. The US 40 designation was removed by 1976 or 1977, when I-80 was completed through the area. The designation of roadway now numbered US 93 Alt. has changed twice in the past. Between 1932 and 1953, it was designated <a href="U.S.%20Route%2050%20in%20Nevada">US 50</a>, and between 1954 and either 1978 and 1979, it was designated US 50 Alt.
Two other roads have been numbered Utah SR-58 in the past. The first route designated SR-58 was formed in 1945 between <a href="Utah%20State%20Route%2036">SR-36</a> and <a href="Clover%2C%20Utah">Clover</a>, but was <a href="wikt%3Adecommission">decommission</a>ed in 1953. The second road to use the designation was formed in 1965 between <a href="Interstate%2015%20in%20Utah">I-15</a> in <a href="New%20Harmony%2C%20Utah">New Harmony</a> back to I-15 via <a href="Kanarraville%2C%20Utah">Kanarraville</a>, but that road was decommissioned in 1969. The current SR-58 was codified into Utah law in 1969 between the state line and the junction with Frontage Road, which was formerly US 40. Wendover Boulevard between US 93 Alt. and the state line was designated SR 224 between July 1, 1976, and April 28, 1993, when the highway was transferred to Elko County.

Even though BL-80 is signed in both Nevada and Utah, the route has never been officially designated a business loop by the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20and%20Transportation%20Officials">American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a> (AASHTO) or by the <a href="Utah%20State%20Legislature">Utah State Legislature</a>. Nevada DOT applied for the designation, but in July 1982 the application was deferred by AASHTO until Utah submitted a request for a business loop. No such request has ever been submitted.

Prior to 2007, BL-80 was the only connection to the city of Wendover from Utah. However, a new partial <a href="diamond%20interchange">diamond interchange</a>, which allows traffic from I-80 to exit going westbound and for traffic to enter I-80 eastbound, at Aria Boulevard was constructed. The Aria Boulevard interchange was first planned in 2005, and was completed without using any federal funding.

In 2007, the City of West Wendover had two historical markers installed along BL-80, one at the state line, and the other at the intersection of US 93 Alt. to commemorate the Victory Highway and US 40.

Lessons for Children

Lessons for Children is a series of four age-adapted <a href="Primer%20%28textbook%29">reading primers</a> written by the prominent 18th-century British poet and essayist <a href="Anna%20Laetitia%20Barbauld">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</a>. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered: the <a href="Typography">typographically</a> simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. In perhaps the first demonstration of experiential <a href="pedagogy">pedagogy</a> in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts a mother and her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>, Barbauld's books emphasise learning through the senses.

One of the primary morals of Barbauld's lessons is that individuals are part of a community; in this she was part of a tradition of female writing that emphasised the interconnectedness of society. Charles, the hero of the texts, explores his relationship to nature, to animals, to people, and finally to God.

"Lessons" had a significant effect on the development of children's literature in Britain and the United States. <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Trimmer">Sarah Trimmer</a>, <a href="Jane%20Taylor%20%28poet%29">Jane Taylor</a>, and <a href="Ellenor%20Fenn">Ellenor Fenn</a>, to name a few of the most illustrious, were inspired to become children's authors because of "Lessons" and their works dominated children's literature for several generations. "Lessons" itself was reprinted for over a century. However, because of the disrepute that educational writings fell into, largely due to the low esteem awarded Barbauld, Trimmer, and others by contemporary male <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> writers, Barbauld's "Lessons" has rarely been studied by scholars. In fact, it has only been analysed in depth since the 1990s.

"Lessons" depicts a mother teaching her son. Presumably, many of the events were inspired by Barbauld's experiences of teaching her own adopted son, her nephew Charles, as the events correlate with his age and growth. Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed the probable publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: "Lessons for Children of two to three" (1778); "Lessons for Children of three, part I" (1778); "Lessons for Children of three, part II" (1778); and "Lessons for Children of three to four" (1779). After its initial publication, the series was often published as a single volume.
Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins, so that children could easily read them; she was more than likely the "originator" of this practice, according to Barbauld scholar William McCarthy, and "almost certainly [its] popularizer". In her history of children's literature in "<a href="The%20Guardian%20of%20Education">The Guardian of Education</a>" (1802–1806), <a href="Sarah%20Trimmer">Sarah Trimmer</a> noted these innovations, as well as the use of good-quality paper and large spaces between words. While making reading easier, these production changes also made the books too expensive for the children of the poor, therefore Barbauld's books helped to create a distinct aesthetic for the middle-class children's book.

Barbauld's texts were designed for the developing reader, beginning with words of one syllable and progressing to multi-syllabic words. The first part of "Lessons" includes simple statements such as: "Ink is black, and papa's shoes are black. Paper is white, and Charles's frock is white." The second part increases in difficulty: "February is very cold too, but the days are longer, and there is a yellow crocus coming up, and the <a href="Daphne%20mezereum">mezereon</a> tree is in blossom, and there are some white snow-drops peeking up their little heads."

Barbauld also "departs from previous reading primers by introducing elements of story, or narrative, piecemeal before introducing her first story": the narrator explains the idea of "sequentiality" to Charles, and implicitly to the reader, before ever telling him a story. For example, the days of the week are explained before Charles's trip to France.

Barbauld's "Lessons" emphasises the value of all kinds of language and literacy; not only do readers learn how to read but they also acquire the ability to understand metaphors and analogies. The fourth volume in particular fosters poetic thinking and as McCarthy points out, its passages on the moon mimic Barbauld's poem "A Summer Evening's Meditation":

Barbauld also developed a particular style that would dominate British and American children's literature for a generation: an "informal dialogue between parent and child", a conversational style that emphasised linguistic communication. "Lessons" starts out monopolised by the mother's voice but slowly, over the course of the volumes, Charles's voice is increasingly heard as he gains confidence in his own ability to read and speak. This style was an implicit critique of late 18th-century pedagogy, which typically employed rote learning and memorisation.

Barbauld's "Lessons" also illustrates mother and child engaging in <a href="wikt%3Aquotidian">quotidian</a> activities and taking nature walks. Through these activities, the mother teaches Charles about the world around him and he explores it. This, too, was a challenge to the pedagogical orthodoxy of the day, which did not encourage experiential learning. The mother shows Charles the seasons, the times of the day, and different minerals by bringing him to them rather than simply describing them and having him recite those descriptions. Charles learns the principles of "botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry ... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [and] astronomy". He also inquires about all of them, making the learning process dynamic.

Barbauld's pedagogy was fundamentally based on <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>'s "<a href="Some%20Thoughts%20Concerning%20Education">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</a>" (1693), the most influential pedagogical treatise in 18th-century Britain. Building on Locke's theory of the <a href="Association%20of%20Ideas">Association of Ideas</a>, which he had outlined in "Some Thoughts", philosopher <a href="David%20Hartley%20%28philosopher%29">David Hartley</a> had developed an associationist psychology that greatly influenced writers such as Barbauld (who had read <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a>'s redaction of it). For the first time, educational theorists and practitioners were thinking in terms of developmental psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an age-specific readership.
"Lessons" not only teaches literacy, "it also initiates the child [reader] into the elements of society's symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility". One of the series' overall aims is to demonstrate that Charles is superior to the animals he encounters—because he can speak and reason, he is better than they are. "Lessons for Children, of Three Years Old, part 2" begins:

Andrew O'Malley writes in his survey of 18th-century children's literature, "from helping poor animals [Charles] eventually makes a seamless transition to performing small acts of charity for the poor children he encounters". Charles learns to care for his fellow human beings through his exposure to animals. Barbauld's "Lessons" is not, therefore, <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> in the traditional sense; it does not emphasise the solitary self or the individual. As McCarthy puts it, "every human being needs other human beings in order to live. Humans are communal entities".

"Lessons" was probably meant to be paired with Barbauld's "<a href="Hymns%20in%20Prose%20for%20Children">Hymns in Prose for Children</a>" (1781), which were both written for Charles. As <a href="F.%20J.%20Harvey%20Darton">F. J. Harvey Darton</a>, an early scholar of children's literature, explains, they "have the same ideal, in one aspect held by Rousseau, in another wholly rejected by him: the belief that a child should steadily contemplate Nature, and the conviction that by so doing he will be led to contemplate the traditional God". However, some modern scholars have pointed
to the lack of overt religious references in "Lessons", particularly in contrast to "Hymns", to make the claim that it is secular.

One important theme in "Lessons" is restriction of the child, a theme which has been interpreted both positively and negatively by critics. In what Mary Jackson has called the "new child" of the 18th century, she describes "a fondly sentimentalized state of childishness rooted in material and emotional dependency on adults" and she argues that the "new good child seldom made important, real decisions without parental approval ... In short, the new good child was a paragon of dutiful submissiveness, refined virtue, and appropriate sensibility." Other scholars, such as Sarah Robbins, have maintained that Barbauld presents images of constraint only to offer images of liberation later in the series: education for Barbauld, in this interpretation, is a progression from restraint to liberation, physically represented by Charles' slow movement from his mother's lap in the opening scene of first book, to a stool next to her in the opening of the subsequent volume, to his detachment from her side in the final book.

"Lessons for Children" and Barbauld's other popular children's book, "<a href="Hymns%20in%20Prose%20for%20Children">Hymns in Prose for Children</a>", had an unprecedented impact; not only did they influence the poetry of <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> and <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>, particularly Blake's "<a href="Songs%20of%20Innocence%20and%20Experience">Songs of Innocence and Experience</a>" (1789–94), they were also used to teach several generations of schoolchildren both in Britain and the United States. Barbauld's texts were used to perpetuate the ideal of <a href="Republican%20motherhood">Republican motherhood</a> in 19th-century America, particularly the notion of the mother as the educator of the nation. British children's author and critic <a href="Charlotte%20Yonge">Charlotte Yonge</a> wrote in 1869 that the books had taught "three-quarters of the gentry of the last three generations" to read. Poet <a href="Elizabeth%20Barrett%20Browning">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a> could still recite the beginning of "Lessons" at age thirty-nine.

Writers of all stamps immediately recognised the revolutionary nature of Barbauld's books. After meeting Barbauld, the famous 18th-century novelist <a href="Frances%20Burney">Frances Burney</a> described her and her books:

Barbauld herself believed that her writing was noble and she encouraged others to follow in her footsteps. As Betsy Rodgers, her biographer, explains: "she gave prestige to the writing of juvenile literature, and by not lowering her standard of writing for children, she inspired others to write on a similar high standard". In fact, because of Barbauld, <a href="Sarah%20Trimmer">Sarah Trimmer</a> and <a href="Hannah%20More">Hannah More</a> were galvanised to write for poor children and to organise a large-scale <a href="Sunday%20School">Sunday School</a> movement. <a href="Ann%20Taylor%20%28poet%29">Ann</a> and <a href="Jane%20Taylor%20%28poet%29">Jane Taylor</a> began writing children's poetry, the most famous of which is "<a href="Twinkle%20Twinkle%20Little%20Star">Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star</a>". <a href="Ellenor%20Fenn">Ellenor Fenn</a> wrote and designed a series of readers and games for middle-class children, including the best-selling "<a href="Cobwebs%20to%20Catch%20Flies">Cobwebs to Catch Flies</a>" (1784). <a href="Richard%20Lovell%20Edgeworth">Richard Lovell Edgeworth</a> began one of the first systematic studies of childhood development which would culminate not only in an educational treatise co-authored with <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a> entitled "<a href="Practical%20Education">Practical Education</a>" (1798), but also in a large body of children's stories by Maria, beginning with "<a href="The%20Parent%27s%20Assistant">The Parent's Assistant</a>" (1798). <a href="Thomas%20Day">Thomas Day</a> originally began his important "<a href="The%20History%20of%20Sandford%20and%20Merton">The History of Sandford and Merton</a>" (1783–89) for Edgeworth's collection, but it grew too long and was published separately.

In the second half of the 1790s, Barbauld and her brother, the physician <a href="John%20Aikin">John Aikin</a>, wrote a second series of books, "<a href="Evenings%20at%20Home">Evenings at Home</a>", aimed at more advanced readers, ages eight to twelve. While not as influential, these were also popular and remained in print for decades. "Lessons" was reprinted, translated, pirated, and imitated until the 20th century; according to Myers, it helped found a female tradition of educational writing.
While Day, for example, has been hailed as an educational innovator, Barbauld has most often been described through the unsympathetic words of her detractors. The politician <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a> and the writer and critic <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> ridiculed Barbauld's children's books and believed that she was wasting her poetic talents. In his "<a href="Life%20of%20Johnson">Life of Johnson</a>" (1791), <a href="James%20Boswell">James Boswell</a> recorded Johnson's thoughts:

Barbauld had published a successful book of poetry in 1773 which Johnson greatly admired; he viewed her switch to children's literature as a descent. The most damning and lasting criticism, however, came from the Romantic essayist <a href="Charles%20Lamb%20%28writer%29">Charles Lamb</a> in a <a href="Letters%20of%20Charles%20Lamb">letter</a> to the poet <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>:

This quote was used by writers and scholars to condemn Barbauld and other educational writers for a century. As Myers argues:

It is only in the 1990s and 2000s that Barbauld and other female educational writers are beginning to be acknowledged in the history of children's literature and, indeed, in the history of literature itself. As Myers points out, "the writing woman as teacher has not captured the imagination of feminist scholars", and Barbauld's children's works are usually consigned to "the backwaters of children's literature surveys, usually deplored for their pernicious effect on the emergent cultural construction of Romantic childhood, or in the margins of commentary on male high Romanticism, a minor inspiration for Blake or Wordsworth perhaps". The male Romantics did not explore didactic genres that illustrated educational progress; rather, as Myers explains, their works embodied a "nostalgia for lost youth and [a] pervasive valorization of instinctive juvenile wisdom" not shared by many female writers at this time.

Serious scholarship is just beginning to investigate the complexities of Barbauld's "Lessons"; McCarthy, for example, has noted the resonances between "Lessons" and <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>'s "<a href="The%20Wasteland">The Wasteland</a>" that have yet to be explored:

Thomas Ellison

Thomas Rangiwahia Ellison, also known as Tom Ellison or Tamati Erihana (c. 1867 – 2 October 1904) was a New Zealand <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> player and lawyer. He led the first <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand representative</a> rugby team organised by the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Rugby%20Union">New Zealand Rugby Football Union</a> (NZRFU) on their 1893 <a href="1893%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Australia">tour</a> of Australia. Ellison also played in the <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20New%20Zealand%20Native%20football%20team">1888–89 New Zealand Native football team</a> on their epic 107-match tour, scoring 113 points, and 43 <a href="try">tries</a> with the side.

Born in <a href="Otakou">Otakou</a>, <a href="Otago%20Heads">Otago Heads</a>, Ellison was educated at <a href="Te%20Aute%20College">Te Aute College</a>, where he was introduced to rugby. After moving to <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>, Ellison played for the Poneke Football Club, and was selected to play for <a href="Wellington%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Wellington province</a>. He was recruited into <a href="Joe%20Warbrick">Joe Warbrick</a>'s privately organised Native football team in 1888, and continued to play for both Poneke and Wellington on his return from that tour. In 1892, he started to refine and popularise the wing-forward system of play, which was a vital element of New Zealand rugby's success until 1932. At the first NZRFU annual general meeting in 1893, he proposed that the playing colours of the New Zealand side should be predominantly black with a silver fern—a playing strip that would give the team their famous name of "All Blacks". He retired from playing rugby after captaining the 1893 New Zealand side to New South Wales and Queensland, but continued in the sport as a coach and administrator. Ellison was the author of a coaching manual, "The Art of Rugby Football", published in 1902.

As well as being one of the first Māori admitted to the <a href="Admission%20to%20practice%20law">bar</a>, practising as a <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a>, and later as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, Ellison also stood unsuccessfully for the <a href="Southern%20Maori">Southern Maori</a> parliamentary seat several times. After contracting <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in 1904, he was briefly institutionalised before dying later that year.

Thomas Rangiwahia Ellison was born in Otakou at Otago Heads, to Raniera Taheke Ellison and Nani Weller, sometime between 1866 and 1868. He was named after his paternal grandfather, and his middle name, "Rangiwahia", was given in honour of his great-uncle. Ellison was <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a>: of <a href="Ng%C4%81i%20Tahu">Ngāi Tahu</a> and <a href="K%C4%81ti%20M%C4%81moe">Kāti Māmoe</a> <a href="Iwi">tribal</a> heritage through his mother, and of <a href="Te%20%C4%80ti%20Awa">Te Āti Awa</a> heritage through his father. Introduced to rugby at the age of around 14 by his cousins at Otakou, Ellison later wrote of his first game:
After completing his education at Otakou Native School, Ellison was awarded a scholarship in 1882 to attend the famous Māori secondary school Te Aute College in the <a href="Hawke%27s%20Bay%20%28region%29">Hawke's Bay</a>. He started playing organised rugby there, and during his final two years played in the school team that won the Hawke's Bay senior club championship. Later in life Ellison claimed that at Te Aute he learned, "nearly all I ever knew of <a href="Rugby%20union%20positions%23Forwards">forward</a> play".

After moving to Wellington, Ellison joined the <a href="Poneke%20Football%20Club">Poneke Football Club</a> in 1885. The Poneke team played junior club rugby at the time, but were promoted to the senior competition after winning all their matches that year. Following their promotion the side won the Wellington club championship each year from 1886 to 1889. Ellison was selected to play for the Wellington provincial team in 1885, and continued to be selected for Wellington until 1892. He eventually earned 23 <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a>—a large number for the time. Initially Ellison played as a forward or on the <a href="Rugby%20union%20positions%23Wing">wing</a>, but later played <a href="Rugby%20union%20positions%23Scrum-half">half-back</a>.

In early 1888 Joe Warbrick attempted to organise a private party of Māori players to tour Great Britain—later known as the New Zealand Native football team. A cousin of Ellison's, <a href="John%20Taiaroa">Jack Taiaroa</a>, who had toured with the New Zealand team that travelled to <a href="1884%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales in 1884</a>, helped Warbrick recruit players for his proposed tour. It was most likely because of Taiaroa that Ellison was persuaded to join Warbrick's Natives team. Warbrick eventually assembled a side that included both Māori and non-Māori New Zealand-born players, and several players born overseas. The final team consisted of 26 players, and toured New Zealand before departing to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. They then toured Great Britain, Australia, and finally New Zealand again—the trip lasted 14 months. Ellison played mostly as a forward throughout the tour, and played at least 83 of the team's 107 matches; including a minimum of 58 in Britain.

Ellison played all of the Natives' three internationals—against <a href="Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Ireland</a>, <a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wales</a>, and <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a>. The Ireland match was the first international of the tour, two months after their arrival in the British Isles. The fixture was played at <a href="Lansdowne%20Road">Lansdowne Road</a>, <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, on 1 December 1888, with Ellison in the forwards. Ireland led 3–0 at half-time, but the Natives improved considerably in the second-half, scoring four tries. The third try scored was by Ellison after a counter-attack by <a href="George%20Williams%20%28rugby%20union%29">George Williams</a>. The try was not <a href="try%23conversion">converted</a>, but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the team a 13–4 victory. The Irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team, but Ireland went on to defeat Wales later that season. The match against Wales was later that month, 22 December, in <a href="St.%20Helen%27s%20Rugby%20and%20Cricket%20Ground">Swansea</a>. Again Ellison played in the forwards, and the Natives dominated for significant periods of the match. Ellison made several strong runs, and at one point crossed the try-line only to be carried back into play. They failed to score, however, and Wales were victorious 5–0 (one conversion and two tries to nil).

One of the most notable events of the Natives' tour occurred during the match against England at <a href="Blackheath%2C%20London">Blackheath</a>. Owing to a dispute over the formation of the <a href="International%20Rugby%20Board">International Rugby Football Board</a>, England had not played an international in nearly two years. This contributed to at least twelve of their team lacking international experience—however many of their players were from strong club and county sides. The match was notable for a dispute between the New Zealanders and the match referee—<a href="George%20Rowland%20Hill">Rowland Hill</a>. Early in the second half Ellison attempted to tackle the English player <a href="Andrew%20Stoddart">Andrew Stoddart</a>, and in the process managed to rip his shorts off. The Natives' players promptly formed a circle around Stoddart to allow him to replace his clothing without being exposed to the gazes of the crowd. While this was happening one of the English players, Frank Evershed, picked up the ball and scored a try. The New Zealanders protested, believing that play had stopped after claiming Stoddart had called "dead ball". Hill awarded the try however, causing several of the Native players to leave the field in protest. The aggrieved players were eventually persuaded to return, but not before Hill had restarted play. Ellison was very critical of Hill; particularly because Hill was also Secretary of England's <a href="Rugby%20Football%20Union">Rugby Football Union</a>. Writing after the tour, Ellison said of the incident: "gross as these errors were, they were insignificant when compared with another that Mr Hill committed at the outset of the game, viz, refereeing at all in that game".

The team was generally very well received outside London, and especially in north, where rugby was dominated by the working-class. Reaction to the team in the south, where the <a href="Public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">public school</a> establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures we had to go through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted not so much on the field of play as off it".

Thomas Eyton, one of the promoters of the tour, said of Ellison's contribution—"His knowledge of the finer points of the game, his weight, strength and activity rendered his services invaluable." Ellison participated in most of the Natives' matches, scoring 113 points, and 43 tries on tour; this included 23 tries in Britain and Ireland, four in New South Wales, five in Queensland, and ten in New Zealand.

After completion of the tour, Ellison continued to play for Poneke and Wellington. While playing with his club, Ellison implemented the use of a wing-forward and seven-man <a href="scrum%20%28rugby%20union%29">scrum</a> positional system. It is not known exactly who invented the position of wing-forward, but Ellison claimed in "The Art of Rugby Football" that he had developed it; historian Greg Ryan claims the position was developed in northern England, and that Ellison only refined it after discovering it during the Natives' tour. The distinctive feature of wing-forward play was their role of feeding the ball into the scrum, and subsequently holding onto one of the <a href="Rugby%20union%20positions%23Hooker">hookers</a> while the ball progressed through the scrum to the half-back. With the wing-forward bound to the side of the scrum, the opposing half-back would then have to manoeuvre past them to tackle the player with the ball; this would increase the amount of time the half-back would have in possession of the ball before their opposite could tackle them. Ellison claimed that he devised the position while playing for Poneke after he "found it impossible for the smartest of referees to detect and amply penalize <a href="Offside%20%28rugby%29">off-side</a> interferences of opponents bent on spoiling my passes".

Regardless of the origins of the position, Ellison was instrumental in promoting its adoption throughout New Zealand. Although it is unclear whether the wing-forward was used during the 1893 tour of Australia, by the time of the All Blacks' first <a href="Test%20match%20%28rugby%20union%29">Test match</a>, played during their <a href="1903%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Australia">1903 Australian tour</a>, the position was engrained within the New Zealand style of play. The use of a wing-forward provoked controversy both in New Zealand, and later in the British Isles after the All Blacks toured there in 1905; wing-forwards were often accused of off-side obstruction of the opposition half-back. According to Ellison however, if the position was implemented properly, then there would be no cause for complaint. The wing-forward continued as a vital component of New Zealand rugby until long-standing complaints from the unions of the <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a> resulted in the position being outlawed by the International Rugby Football Board in 1932.

In 1892, the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU—later renamed New Zealand Rugby Union) was formed by the majority of New Zealand's provincial rugby unions. Ellison was a Wellington provincial administrator, and in 1893 at the inaugural NZRFU annual general meeting proposed the playing strip for the first officially sanctioned New Zealand side—black cap, black jersey with white fern, white <a href="Knickerbockers%20%28clothing%29">knickerbockers</a> and black stockings. The white knickerbockers were eventually replaced with black shorts, and the uniform itself was based upon that worn by the Native team Ellison had toured with. The black uniform inspired the moniker "All Blacks"—a name which has been adopted by the New Zealand national team since their Northern Hemisphere tour.

The first NZRFU sanctioned New Zealand team was formed to tour New South Wales and Queensland in 1893, and Ellison was selected as their captain. Three other members of the New Zealand Natives' team were also selected for the side. Ellison played seven matches on the tour, including matches against <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Queensland%20Reds">Queensland</a>. The team won ten of their eleven matches—the one loss being to New South Wales in Sydney. In addition to scoring two tries, Ellison kicked six conversions and a goal from a mark to give him 23 points for the tour—the second highest of any player. The tour was the end of his participation in the sport as a player.

Ellison's complete playing record comprised 117 matches, 68 of which were first-class games. He scored a total of 160 career points, including 51 tries. Ellison continued involvement with rugby as a provincial administrator, provincial referee, and manager. As an administrator, he proposed that players be financially compensated for wages missed while on long tours; this was in 1898—nearly a century before rugby relinquished its amateur status. This proposal applied specifically to tours that travelled outside New Zealand; writing at the time regarding the amateur regulations, Ellison said "I think that these laws were never intended to apply to extended tours abroad." In 1902 he published "The Art of Rugby Football", a coaching manual on rugby that also included accounts of his experiences as a player. According to journalist Hayden Meikle the book was one of rugby's "pioneering texts", while Greg Ryan wrote that the book "remains a classic work on early rugby strategy."

Outside of his involvement in rugby, Ellison was a lawyer, and was one of the first Māori admitted to the bar. He practised as an interpreter for the Land Courts and as a solicitor; later, he worked as a barrister in the practices of Brandon & Hislop in Wellington. Ellison was also involved in politics, and stood unsuccessfully for the Southern Maori parliamentary seat several times against <a href="Tame%20Parata">Tame Parata</a>, as well as working for government consideration of Ngāi Tahu <a href="Treaty%20of%20Waitangi%20claims%20and%20settlements">land claims</a>. He married Ethel May Howell, a daughter of <a href="John%20Howell%20%28pioneer%29">John Howell</a>, on 22 March 1899; the couple had three children, only one of whom survived infancy, daughter Hinemura who died in 1989. In 1904 Ellison was struck down with tuberculosis, and was admitted to <a href="Porirua%20Lunatic%20Asylum">Porirua Lunatic Asylum</a> before dying on 2 October that same year. Ellison was buried in Otakou, Otago Heads, following the original plan of a burial at <a href="Karori">Karori</a>. Representatives of Ellison's parents intercepted the body in <a href="Porirua">Porirua</a>, and his wife and <a href="Public%20Trustee%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Public Trustee</a> then agreed for him to be buried at Otakou. There his gravestone reads "One of the greatest rugby footballers New Zealand ever possessed".

Ellison's influence on New Zealand rugby is such that Māori researcher Malcolm Mulholland stated he was "arguably the player who contributed the most to New Zealand rugby". In 1916, when discussing the question of the greatest player New Zealand had produced, the pseudonymous "Touchline" wrote: "I am prepared to say that the late T. R. Ellison... was the greatest of them all." He went on to say: 

Ellison has been inducted into the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Māori Sports Hall of Fame</a>, and in 2005 was listed as one of "<a href="New%20Zealand%27s%20Top%20100%20History%20Makers">New Zealand's Top 100 History Makers</a>". The New Zealand Native Football team was inducted into the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Rugby Hall of Fame</a> (then the International Rugby Board Hall of Fame) in 2008, the first side awarded the honour.

Eriksen</a> and Al Hemberger. <a href="Phil%20Tan">Phil Tan</a> and Josh Houghkirk <a href="Mixing%20%28music%20production%29">mixed</a> the single, and StarGate provided vocal production and instrumentation.

In February 2009, Cameroonian musician <a href="Manu%20Dibango">Manu Dibango</a> filed a lawsuit claiming that "Don't Stop the Music" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin used the "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" hook without his permission. According to Dibango, the line is from his 1972 single "<a href="Soul%20Makossa">Soul Makossa</a>". <a href="Agence%20France-Presse">Agence France-Presse</a> reported that Jackson admitted that he borrowed the line for "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin and settled out of court. When Rihanna asked Jackson in 2007 for permission to sample the line, he allegedly approved the request without contacting Dibango beforehand. Dibango's attorneys brought the case before a court in Paris, demanding <a href="Euro">€</a>500,000 in damages and asking for <a href="Sony%20BMG">Sony BMG</a>, <a href="EMI">EMI</a> and <a href="Warner%20Music">Warner Music</a> to be "barred from receiving 'mama-say mama-sa'-related income until the matter is resolved". The judge ruled that Dibango's claim was inadmissible: a year earlier, a different Paris-area judge had required Universal Music to include Dibango's name in the liner notes of future French releases of "Don't Stop the Music", and at the time of this earlier court appearance, Dibango had withdrawn legal action, thereby waiving his moral right to seek further damages.

"Don't Stop the Music" was the fourth single from Rihanna's third album, "<a href="Good%20Girl%20Gone%20Bad">Good Girl Gone Bad</a>" (2007). Before its release, two <a href="Remix">promotional remixes</a> of the song (Solitaire's More Drama and the Wideboys Club Mix) were added to digital outlets in Canada and the United States on August 7, 2007. On September 7, an <a href="extended%20play">EP</a> of the single was released via the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> in some countries including Australia, Italy, New Zealand and Spain. The EP contains the Wideboys Club Mix and instrumental and album versions of the song. That day, "Don't Stop the Music" was released as a <a href="CD%20single">CD single</a> in Germany with the same material as the EP and the song's music video. The following month, it was released as a CD single in France. <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a> provided the song to <a href="contemporary%20hit%20radio">contemporary hit radio</a> stations in the United States on January 15, 2008, and to <a href="rhythmic%20contemporary">rhythmic contemporary</a> stations a week later. Nine remixes, including the album version of the song, were released on May 14 to digital outlets in territories including Australia, Germany, New Zealand and Spain.
"Don't Stop the Music" is a four-minute, 27-second <a href="Dance%20music">dance</a> song, written in the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="F-sharp%20minor">F minor</a> in <a href="common%20time">common time</a>, with a moderate <a href="tempo">tempo</a> of 123 <a href="Tempo">beats per minute</a>. Rihanna's voice ranges from <a href="F%E2%99%AF%20%28musical%20note%29">F</a> to <a href="A%20%28musical%20note%29">A</a>. The <a href="syncopation">syncopated</a> song <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a> a variety of layered rhythms, with <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip-hop</a> rhythms and a heavy <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a>beat predominating. The sampled "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" was added to the arrangement as a complementary throbbing motif.

Sal Cinquemani of "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" described "Don't Stop the Music" as having a bouncy feel similar to Rihanna's 2006 single "<a href="SOS%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">SOS</a>". According to Fraser McAlpine of <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s Chart Blog, Rihanna's vocals on the song sound as if she recorded them to a different backing track, "then gave them to some nerdy beatmatcher with an extensive collection of dark electro and classic pop." McAlpine compared the verses' vocal melody to that of <a href="Aaliyah">Aaliyah</a>'s single "<a href="Try%20Again%20%28Aaliyah%20song%29">Try Again</a>", the <a href="refrain">chorus</a> to <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>'s "<a href="La%20Isla%20Bonita">La Isla Bonita</a>", and the base track to <a href="Eric%20Prydz">Eric Prydz</a>-style <a href="trance%20music">trance music</a>. After the release of Rihanna's single "<a href="Only%20Girl%20%28In%20the%20World%29">Only Girl (In the World)</a>" in 2010, many <a href="Music%20journalism">critics</a> compared its composition and structure to "Don't Stop the Music".

Music journalists praised the sampling of the "Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa" hook. For <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>'s Tom Breihan—who characterized "Don't Stop the Music" as "an amazing bit of euroclub insanity combined with synth and bass"—the hook from Jackson's track smoothly blends into the song's powerful beat. Nick Levine of <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a> called "Don't Stop the Music" "brilliant and unwitting", and said that it was the best single with a Jackson writing credit since his 1997 "<a href="Blood%20on%20the%20Dance%20Floor%20%28song%29">Blood on the Dance Floor</a>". "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" Quentin B. Huff wrote that "the Michael Jackson-sampling 'Don't Stop the Music', inspires the type of tail feather shaking you can only produce when you're chanting, 'Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa.

McAlpine called Rihanna's vocals "emotionally removed, a little distant and naughty, but a smidge melancholy and tearful". According to a "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" reviewer, in "Don't Stop the Music" Rihanna "[found] exuberance in a ... severe techno beat". In 2012, "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" ranked the song 13th on its list of "Rihanna's 20 Biggest Billboard Hits" of all time; they wrote, "we defy you to get the hook from this pounding 2007 dancefloor favorite out of your mind."

"Don't Stop the Music" won the Best International Song award at the <a href="2008%20NRJ%20Music%20Awards">2008 NRJ Music Awards</a>.

At the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Composers%2C%20Authors%20and%20Publishers">American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers</a> Pop Music Awards, ASCAP recognized it as one of 2009's most-performed songs. "Don't Stop the Music" was a winning song at the 2009 <a href="Broadcast%20Music%2C%20Inc.">BMI</a> Pop Awards. In 2014, David Drake of the magazine "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" called the single "one of the earliest shots fired in the mainstreaming of dance music" compared with typical 2007 top-forty fare.

The video was digitally released on iTunes on July 26, 2007. It was uploaded on Rihanna's <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a> channel on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> on November 21, 2009.

In the video Rihanna and two friends arrive at a nightclub in a yellow taxi, and enter a candy store where a boy is standing with his mother. Rihanna tells the boy not to tell anyone where they are going, and the singer and her friends sneak into the back of the store (where there is a secret nightclub entrance). The narrative is intercut with Rihanna singing the song against a wall and dancing in the club. After she enters the club, she checks her makeup in a restroom as she sings.

Rihanna returns to the dance floor for the chorus, dancing and singing with her friends. Her fellow club-goers clap along with the sample from "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin. <a href="VH1">VH1</a>'s Christopher Rosa ranked the video 18th on his list of Rihanna's 20 sexiest videos: "This dance-by-numbers song gets a facelift with its brisk, energetic video featuring R as the undisputed queen of the clubs".

Adrian Edwards of <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a> wrote that Cullum's version of "Don't Stop the Music" is one of the best songs on "The Pursuit", and that "the novel production techniques and his broken-voiced pleading to his girl on the dance floor would blend well in any night club with strobe lighting and the clink of glasses at the bar." Cullum's version peaked at number two on the <a href="Ultratip">Ultratip</a> chart in Belgium, number 28 in the Netherlands and number 58 in Germany. A music video for the song was released on December 2, 2009 on Cullum's <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a> channel.

The World Without Us

The World Without Us is a <a href="non-fiction">non-fiction</a> book about what would happen to the <a href="natural%20environment">natural</a> and <a href="built%20environment">built environment</a> if humans suddenly disappeared, written by American journalist <a href="Alan%20Weisman">Alan Weisman</a> and published by <a href="St.%20Martin%27s%20Press">St. Martin's Thomas Dunne Books</a>. It is a book-length expansion of Weisman's own February 2005 "<a href="Discover%20%28magazine%29">Discover</a>" article "Earth Without People". Written largely as a <a href="thought%20experiment">thought experiment</a>, it outlines, for example, how cities and houses would deteriorate, how long man-made artifacts would last, and how remaining lifeforms would evolve. Weisman concludes that residential neighborhoods would become forests within 500 years, and that radioactive waste, <a href="bronze">bronze</a> statues, <a href="plastics">plastics</a>, and <a href="Mount%20Rushmore">Mount Rushmore</a> would be among the longest-lasting evidence of human presence on Earth.

The author of four previous books and numerous articles for magazines, Weisman traveled to interview academics, scientists and other authorities. He used quotations from these interviews to explain the effects of the natural environment and to substantiate predictions. The book has been translated and published in many countries. It was successful in the U.S., reaching #6 on the <a href="New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"New York Times" Best Seller list</a> and #1 on the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" Best-Sellers list in September 2007. It ranked #1 on "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" and "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>'s" of 2007.

The idea of exploring the effects of the depopulating of the Earth is an old one, having been a regular trope in <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> novels for decades. Post-apocalyptic literature in general had often tried to imagine the fate of civilization and its artifacts after the end of humanity. Indeed, an extremely popular 1949 novel, "<a href="Earth%20Abides">Earth Abides</a>," portrayed the breakdown of urban systems and structures after a pandemic, through the eyes of a survivor, who muses at the end of the first chapter: "What would happen to the world and its creatures without man? That he was left to see."

"The World Without Us" applies a more ecological view to "Earth Abides". Before writing it, the author, <a href="Alan%20Weisman">Alan Weisman</a>, had written four books, including, "Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World," in 1998, about the <a href="eco-village">eco-village</a> of <a href="Gaviotas">Gaviotas</a> in Colombia; and "An Echo In My Blood," in 1999, about his family's history immigrating from <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> to the United States. He has worked as an international journalist for American magazines and newspapers, and at the time of writing the book was an Associate Professor of Journalism and Latin American Studies at the <a href="University%20of%20Arizona">University of Arizona</a>. The position required him to teach only one class in the spring semester, and he was free to travel and conduct research the rest of the year.

The idea for "The World Without Us" was suggested to Weisman in 2004 by Josie Glausiusz, an editor at "<a href="Discover%20%28magazine%29">Discover</a>". She had pondered the idea for several years and asked Weisman to write a feature on the subject after she re-read "Journey through a Doomed Land", an article he published in 1994 in "<a href="Harper%27s%20Magazine">Harper's Magazine</a>" about the state of <a href="Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> eight years after abandonment. His "Discover" article, "Earth Without People", published in the February 2005 issue and re-printed in "The Best American Science Writing 2006" anthology, describes how nature has thrived in the abandoned <a href="Korean%20Demilitarized%20Zone">Korean Demilitarized Zone</a> and how nature would overwhelm the <a href="built%20environment">built environment</a> of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Using interviews with <a href="Paleoecology">paleoecologists</a>, the article speculates that <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a> would return and that forest cover, like the <a href="Bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa%20Forest">Białowieża Forest</a>, would spread over Europe and the <a href="eastern%20United%20States">eastern United States</a>. The article raises the prospect of failing power plants, chemical plants, dams, and petroleum tanks.

To expand this into a book, Weisman's agent found an editor and publisher at <a href="St.%20Martin%27s%20Press">St. Martin's Press</a>. Among the 23-page bibliography are two articles he wrote for the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times%20Magazine">Los Angeles Times Magazine</a> ("Naked Planet" on persistent organic pollutants, and "The Real Indiana Jones" on the <a href="Mayan%20civilization">Mayan civilization</a>) and one published in the "<a href="Cond%C3%A9%20Nast%20Traveler">Condé Nast Traveler</a>" ("Diamond in the Wild" on diamond mining), as well as "Discover"'s "Earth Without People". Additional research saw Weisman travel to England, Cyprus, Turkey, Panama, and Kenya. Interviews with academics quoted in the book include biologist <a href="E.%20O.%20Wilson">E. O. Wilson</a> on the Korean Demilitarized Zone, archaeologist <a href="William%20Rathje">William Rathje</a> on plastics in garbage, forest botanist <a href="Oliver%20Rackham">Oliver Rackham</a> on vegetative cover across Britain, anthropologist <a href="Arthur%20Demarest">Arthur Demarest</a> on the crash of <a href="Maya%20civilization">Mayan civilization</a>, paleobiologist <a href="Douglas%20Erwin">Douglas Erwin</a> on evolution, and philosopher <a href="Nick%20Bostrom">Nick Bostrom</a> on <a href="Transhumanism">Transhumanism</a>.

The book is divided into 27 chapters, with a <a href="Prologue">prelude</a>, <a href="epilogue">coda</a>, <a href="bibliography">bibliography</a> and <a href="Index%20%28publishing%29">index</a>. Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks. It is written from the point of view of a <a href="science%20journalist">science journalist</a> with explanations and testimonies backing his predictions. There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis.

Weisman's thought experiment pursues two themes: how nature would react to the disappearance of humans and what legacy humans would leave behind. To foresee how other life could continue without humans, Weisman reports from areas where the natural environment exists with little human intervention, like the <a href="Bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa%20Forest">Białowieża Forest</a>, the <a href="Kingman%20Reef">Kingman Reef</a>, and the <a href="Palmyra%20Atoll">Palmyra Atoll</a>. He interviews biologist <a href="E.%20O.%20Wilson">E. O. Wilson</a> and visits with members of the <a href="Korean%20Federation%20for%20Environmental%20Movement">Korean Federation for Environmental Movement</a> at the <a href="Korean%20Demilitarized%20Zone">Korean Demilitarized Zone</a> where few humans have penetrated since 1953. He tries to conceive how life may evolve by describing the past evolution of pre-historic plants and animals, but notes Douglas Erwin's warning that "we can't predict what the world will be 5 million years later by looking at the survivors". Several chapters are dedicated to <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a>, which Weisman predicts would proliferate. He profiles soil samples from the past 200 years and extrapolates concentrations of heavy metals and foreign substances into a future without industrial inputs. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and implications for climatic change are likewise examined.

With material from previous articles, Weisman uses the fate of the <a href="Mayan%20civilization">Mayan civilization</a> to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from <a href="Chernobyl">Chernobyl, Ukraine</a> (abandoned in 1986) and <a href="Varosha%20%28Famagusta%29">Varosha, Cyprus</a> (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the <a href="underground%20cities">underground cities</a> in <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a>. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic <a href="tuff">tuff</a>, and are likely to survive for centuries to come.

Weisman uses <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> as a model to outline how an unmaintained urban area would deconstruct. He explains that sewers would clog, underground streams would flood subway corridors, and soils under roads would erode and cave in. From interviews with members of the <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Society">Wildlife Conservation Society</a> and the <a href="New%20York%20Botanical%20Gardens">New York Botanical Gardens</a> Weisman predicts that native vegetation would return, spreading from parks and out-surviving invasive species. Without humans to provide food and warmth, rats and cockroaches would die off.

Weisman explains that a common house would begin to fall apart as water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles. The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the <a href="Pioneer%20plaque">Pioneer plaque</a>s, the <a href="Voyager%20Golden%20Record">Voyager Golden Record</a>, and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.

Breaking from the theme of the natural environment after humans, Weisman considers what could lead to the sudden, complete <a href="human%20extinction">demise of humans</a> without serious damage to the built and natural environment. That scenario, he concludes, is extremely unlikely. He also considers <a href="transhumanism">transhumanism</a>, the <a href="Voluntary%20Human%20Extinction%20Movement">Voluntary Human Extinction Movement</a>, the <a href="Church%20of%20Euthanasia">Church of Euthanasia</a> and <a href="John%20A.%20Leslie">John A. Leslie</a>'s "The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction". Weisman concludes the book considering a new version of the <a href="one-child%20policy">one-child policy</a>. While he admits it is a "draconian measure", he states, "The bottom line is that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder." He responded to criticism of this saying "I knew in advance that I would touch some people's sensitive spots by bringing up the population issue, but I did so because it's been missing too long from the discussion of how we must deal with the situation our economic and demographic growth have driven us too (sic)".

The book was first published on July 10, 2007, as a <a href="hardback">hardback</a> in the United States by <a href="St.%20Martin%27s%20Press">St. Martin's Thomas Dunne Books</a>, in United Kingdom by <a href="Virgin%20Books">Virgin Books</a> and in Canada by <a href="HarperCollins">HarperCollins</a>. The paperback was released in July 2008. It has been translated and published in Denmark by Borgen as "Verden uden os", France by Groupe Flammarion as "Homo disparitus", in Germany by Piper as "Die Welt ohne uns", in Portugal by Estrela Polar as "O Mundo Sem Nós", in Italy by Einaudi as "Il mondo senza di noi", in Poland by CKA as "Świat bez nas", and in Japan by Hayakawa Publishing as "Jinrui ga kieta sekai" (人類が消えた世界 ; "A World where the Human Race has Disappeared").

Pete Garceau designed the cover art for the American release, which one critic said was "a thick layer of sugar-coated sweetness in an effort to not alarm potential readers. 'Yes, I am a book about the environment. But I'm harmless! No, really!' " The Canadian version, designed by Ellen Cipriano, is similar to the American version but with a photo illustration rather than the disarming cartoon illustration. Cover art for the international releases contrast the natural environment with a decaying built environment. <a href="Adam%20Grupper">Adam Grupper</a> voiced the ten-hour-long, unabridged English language <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a> which was published by <a href="Macmillan%20Publishers">Macmillan Audio</a> and <a href="BBC%20Audiobooks">BBC Audiobooks</a>, and released simultaneously with the hardcover book. <a href="AudioFile%20%28magazine%29">AudioFile</a> gave the audio presentation its Earphones Award, called Grupper's reading sincere and balanced, and wrote, "Never veering into sensationalism, always objective and phlegmatic, Grupper takes what could be a depressing topic and makes it a book you just can't stop listening to".

As the book was released Weisman launched his book tour with stops throughout the United States, Canada and overseas to <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> and <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. Weisman did television interviews on "<a href="The%20Daily%20Show">The Daily Show</a>" and "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">The Today Show</a>" and radio interviews on "<a href="Weekend%20Edition">Weekend Edition</a>", "<a href="Talk%20of%20the%20Nation">Talk of the Nation</a>", "<a href="The%20Diane%20Rehm%20Show">The Diane Rehm Show</a>", "<a href="Living%20on%20Earth">Living on Earth</a>", "<a href="Marketplace%20%28radio%20program%29">Marketplace</a>", and "<a href="As%20It%20Happens">As It Happens</a>". Meanwhile, the book debuted on the <a href="New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">New York Times Best Seller list</a> for non-fiction hardcovers at #10 on July 29 and spent nine weeks in the top ten, peaking at #6 on August 12 and September 9. In the Canadian market, it spent 10 weeks on "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>"'s non-fiction best seller list, peaking at #3 on August 11. The book reached #1 on the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" Best-Sellers list for non-fiction on September 23 and spent 11 weeks on the "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top 150 Best-Selling Books, peaking at #48. Reviewers at the <a href="Library%20Journal">Library Journal</a> recommended the book for all environmental collections and the audiobook for most public and academic library audiobook collections. The book ranked #1 on "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" and "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>'s" top of 2007 and was listed in the <a href="Hudson%20Group">Hudson Booksellers'</a> "Best Books published in 2007". In the <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> <a href="Amazon%27s%20Best%20Books%20of%20the%20Year">"Best Books of 2007"</a>, it placed #4 overall in the United States and #1 in the non-fiction category in Canada.

The writing style was positively received as being vivid and well-written, sometimes grim, but with appropriate language. Even an overall negative review by Michael Grunwald in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" remarked the writing was "always lucid, sometimes elegant". In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Book%20Review">The New York Times Book Review</a>" Jennifer Schuessler said Weisman has a "flirtation with religious language, his occasionally portentous impassivity giving way to the familiar rhetoric of eco-hellfire". <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" found the writing had "an arid, plain, what-if style" while being "strangely uniform in tone". On the reporting techniques, Kamiya wrote that "[Weisman's] science reporting, at once lucid and full of wonder ... is the heart and soul of this book" and that it is "written as if by a compassionate and curious observer on another planet". "<a href="The%20Plain%20Dealer">The Plain Dealer</a>" book editor Karen Long said Weisman "uses the precise, unhurried language of a good science writer and shows a knack for unearthing unexpected sources and provocative facts".

Several critics found the lack of an anthropomorphic point of view hurt the book's relevance. Robert Braile in "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" wrote that it has "no real context ... no rationale for probing this fantasy other than [Weisman's] unsubstantiated premise that people find it fascinating". Michael Grunwald in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" also questioned the premise: "Imagining the human footprint on a post-human planet might be fun for dormitory potheads who have already settled the questions of God's existence and Fergie's hotness, but it's not clear why the rest of us need this level of documentary evidence". On the other hand, Alanna Mitchell in the "Globe and Mail" review found relevance in the context of society's passiveness to resource depletion combined with an anthropomorphic vanity. She writes the "book [is] designed to help us find the how of survival by shaking us out of our passive dance with death".

The book's environmental focus was also criticized by some. Christopher Orlet of "<a href="The%20American%20Spectator">The American Spectator</a>" wrote that it is "a prime example of the wrongheaded, extremist views of the Greens". Braile agrees that the book could be "an environmentalist's nightmare, possibly fueling the cheap shots taken at the green movement ... by critics who say environmentalists care more about nature than people". Environmentalist <a href="Alex%20Steffen">Alex Steffen</a> found the book presents nothing new, but that using the sudden and clean disappearance of humans provides a unique framework, although extremely unlikely and insensitive. Two critics who call the book a "<a href="Jeremiad">Jeremiad</a>" ultimately gave it a positive review. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" says "we learn during the course of this book, to feel good about the disappearance of humanity from the Earth".

Other critics hailed the environmental perspective. Chauncey Mabe of the "<a href="South%20Florida%20Sun-Sentinel">South Florida Sun-Sentinel</a>" calls the book "one of the most satisfying environmental books of recent memory, one devoid of self-righteousness, alarmism or tiresome doomsaying". Tom Spears of the <a href="CanWest%20News%20Service">CanWest News Service</a> concludes "it's more a portrait of ourselves, taken through an odd lens" and "[s]ometimes an obituary is the best biography".

The book is categorized as <a href="Science%20book">non-fiction science</a> but some commentators emphasize it may be better described as <a href="speculative%20fiction">speculative fiction</a>. "The World Without Us" is grounded in <a href="Environmental%20journalism">environmental</a> and <a href="science%20journalism">science journalism</a>. Like other environmental books, it discusses the impact that the human race has had on the planet. Weisman's thought experiment removes the judgments and sufferings of humans by focusing on a hypothetical post-human world. This approach to the genre, which "throw[s] the spotlight on the earth itself", was found to be creative and objective. There have been other books that address similar topics, such as <a href="Gregory%20Benford">Gregory Benford</a>'s 1999 book "Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia". <a href="Science%20fiction">Science fiction</a> writers such as <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> ("<a href="The%20War%20of%20the%20Worlds">The War of the Worlds</a>", 1898) and <a href="John%20Wyndham">John Wyndham</a> ("<a href="The%20Day%20of%20the%20Triffids">The Day of the Triffids</a>", 1951) had earlier touched upon the possible fate of cities and other man-made structures after the sudden removal of their creators. Similar parallels in the decay of civilization are detailed in 1949 post-apocalyptic <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> <a href="novel">novel</a> by Berkeley English professor <a href="George%20R.%20Stewart">George R. Stewart</a>, "<a href="Earth%20Abides">Earth Abides</a>."

Addressing his approach, Weisman said that eliminating the human element eliminated the "fear factor" that people are doing something wrong or that they will die; it is meant to be read as a fantasy, according to the author. Josie Appleton of "<a href="Spiked%20%28magazine%29">Spiked</a>" related the book to "today's romanticisation of nature" in that it linked "the decadence and detachment of a modern consumerist society" with an ignorance of the efforts required to produce products so easily disposed. Appleton also felt the book countered the "Nature knows best" notion by highlighting the randomness of natural forces.

Weisman's science journalism style uses interviews with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, while maintaining the "cool and dispassionate [tone]...of a scientific observer rather than an activist". Weisman said he purposely avoided the <a href="activist">activist</a> label: "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for whatever it is you believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it." <a href="Richard%20Fortey">Richard Fortey</a> compares the book to the works of <a href="Jared%20Diamond">Jared Diamond</a>, <a href="Tim%20Flannery">Tim Flannery</a> and <a href="E.O.%20Wilson">E.O. Wilson</a>, and writes that "The World Without Us" "narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity". <a href="Mark%20Lynas">Mark Lynas</a> in the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>" noted that "whereas most environmental books sag under the weight of their accumulated bad news, "The World Without Us" seems refreshingly positive". Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying "if the planet can recover from the <a href="Permian%E2%80%93Triassic%20extinction%20event">Permian</a>, it can recover from the human".


There have been several TV specials relating to the same topic:

The 2009 hip-hop song "The High Line" by <a href="Kinetics%20%26amp%3B%20One%20Love">Kinetics & One Love</a>, inspired by "The World Without Us", is a pro-green, anti-deforestation song that paints the picture of trees and plants reclaiming the buildings of New York City long after the presence of humans. Like author Alan Weisman, rapper Kinetics uses the <a href="High%20Line">High Line</a> railway in Manhattan as an example of nature’s potential for reclamation of manmade structures.

The 2013 video game "<a href="The%20Last%20of%20Us">The Last of Us</a>", which takes place twenty years after an apocalyptic event, uses "The World Without Us" as inspiration for the look of the city settings.

The 2017 video game "", which considers the Earth devoid of humanity for several hundreds of years, draws heavy inspiration from "The World Without Us"'s depictions of cities and former civilisation habitats in its level design.

In 2009 <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> purchased the rights to the book with the intent of creating a motion picture.

Malagasy cuisine

Malagasy cuisine encompasses the many diverse culinary traditions of the Indian Ocean island of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Foods eaten in Madagascar reflect the influence of Southeast Asian, African, Indian, Chinese and European migrants that have settled on the island since it was first populated by seafarers from <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> between 100 CE and 500 CE. Rice, the cornerstone of the <a href="Malagasy%20people">Malagasy</a> diet, was cultivated alongside <a href="tuber">tuber</a>s and other Southeast Asian staples by these earliest settlers. Their diet was supplemented by foraging and hunting wild game, which contributed to the extinction of the island's bird and <a href="mammal">mammal</a> <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a>. These food sources were later complemented by beef in the form of <a href="zebu">zebu</a> introduced into Madagascar by East African migrants arriving around 1,000 CE. Trade with <a href="Arab%20people">Arab</a> and <a href="Indian%20people">Indian</a> merchants and European transatlantic traders further enriched the island's culinary traditions by introducing a wealth of new fruits, vegetables, and seasonings.

Throughout almost the entire island, the contemporary cuisine of Madagascar typically consists of a base of rice served with an accompaniment; in the official dialect of the <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy language</a>, the rice is termed "vary" (), and the accompaniment, "laoka" (). The many varieties of laoka may be <a href="vegetarian%20cuisine">vegetarian</a> or include animal proteins, and typically feature a sauce flavored with such ingredients as <a href="ginger">ginger</a>, onion, garlic, tomato, <a href="vanilla">vanilla</a>, <a href="sodium%20chloride">salt</a>, <a href="curry%20powder">curry powder</a>, or, less commonly, other spices or herbs. In parts of the arid south and west, <a href="pastoralism">pastoral</a> families may replace rice with maize, <a href="cassava">cassava</a>, or <a href="curd">curd</a>s made from fermented zebu milk. A wide variety of sweet and savory <a href="fritter">fritter</a>s as well as other street foods are available across the island, as are diverse tropical and temperate-climate fruits. Locally produced beverages include fruit juices, coffee, <a href="herbal%20tea">herbal tea</a>s and <a href="tea">tea</a>s, and alcoholic drinks such as <a href="rum">rum</a>, wine, and beer.

The range of dishes eaten in Madagascar in the 21st century offers insight into the island's unique history and the diversity of the peoples who inhabit it today. The complexity of Malagasy meals can range from the simple, traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers, to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island's <a href="Merina%20Kingdom">19th-century monarchs</a>. Although the classic Malagasy meal of rice and its accompaniment remains predominant, over the past 100 years other food types and combinations have been popularized by <a href="French%20people%20in%20Madagascar">French colonists</a> and immigrants from <a href="Chinese%20people%20in%20Madagascar">China</a> and <a href="Indians%20in%20Madagascar">India</a>. Consequently, Malagasy cuisine is traditional while also assimilating newly emergent cultural influences.

<a href="Austronesian%20peoples">Austronesian</a> seafarers are believed to have been the first humans to settle on the island, arriving between 100 and 500 CE. In their <a href="outrigger%20canoe">outrigger canoe</a>s they carried food staples from home including rice, <a href="Plantain%20%28cooking%29">plantain</a>s, <a href="taro">taro</a>, and <a href="Purple%20yam">water yam</a>. Sugarcane, ginger, sweet potatoes, pigs and chickens were also probably brought to Madagascar by these first settlers, along with coconut and banana. The first concentrated population of human settlers emerged along the southeastern coast of the island, although the first landfall may have been made on the northern coast. Upon arrival, early settlers practiced "tavy" (swidden, "<a href="Slash%20and%20burn">slash-and-burn</a>" agriculture) to clear the virgin coastal <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s for the cultivation of crops. They also gathered honey, fruits, bird and crocodile eggs, mushrooms, <a href="List%20of%20edible%20seeds">edible seeds</a> and <a href="List%20of%20root%20vegetables">roots</a>, and brewed alcoholic beverages from honey and sugar cane juice.

<a href="Game%20%28food%29">Game</a> was regularly hunted and trapped in the forests, including frogs, snakes, lizards, hedgehogs and <a href="tenrec">tenrec</a>s, tortoises, wild boars, insects, <a href="larva">larva</a>e, birds and <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's wealth of megafauna, including <a href="Subfossil%20lemur">giant lemurs</a>, <a href="elephant%20bird">elephant bird</a>s, <a href="giant%20fossa">giant fossa</a> and the <a href="Malagasy%20hippopotamus">Malagasy hippopotamus</a>. Early Malagasy communities may have eaten the eggs and—less commonly—the meat of "<a href="Aepyornis%20maximus">Aepyornis maximus</a>", the world's largest bird, which remained widespread throughout Madagascar as recently as the 17th century. While <a href="Subfossil%20lemur%23Hypotheses">several theories</a> have been proposed to explain the decline and eventual <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event%23Madagascar">extinction of Malagasy megafauna</a>, clear evidence suggests that hunting by humans and destruction of habitats through slash-and-burn agricultural practices were key factors. Although it has been illegal to hunt or trade any of the remaining species of lemur since 1964, these endangered animals <a href="Lemur%23Conservation%20efforts">continue to be hunted</a> for immediate local consumption in rural areas or to supply the demand for exotic bush meat at some urban restaurants.

As more <a href="Old-growth%20forest">virgin forest</a> was lost to tavy, communities increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600 CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">central highlands</a>. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. <a href="Paddy%20field">Irrigated rice paddies</a> were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in <a href="Betsileo">Betsileo</a> country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of <a href="Imerina">Imerina</a>. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.

Zebu, a form of humped cattle, were introduced to the island around 1000 CE by settlers from east Africa, who also brought <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, goats, possibly <a href="Bambara%20groundnut">Bambara groundnut</a>, and other food sources. Because these cattle represented a form of wealth in east African and consequently Malagasy culture, they were eaten only rarely, typically after their ritual sacrifice at events of spiritual import such as funerals. Fresh zebu milk and curds instead constituted a major part of the pastoralists' diet. Zebu were kept in large herds in the south and west, but as individual herd members escaped and reproduced, a sizable population of wild zebu established itself in the highlands. <a href="Merina">Merina</a> oral history tells that highland people were unaware that zebu were edible prior to the reign of King <a href="Ralambo">Ralambo</a> (ruled 1575–1612), who is credited with the discovery, although archaeological evidence suggests that zebu were occasionally hunted and consumed in the highlands prior to Ralambo's time. It is more likely that these wild herds were first domesticated and kept in pens during this period, which corresponds with the emergence of complex, structured <a href="polity">polities</a> in the highlands.

Foods were commonly prepared by boiling in water (at first using green bamboo as a vessel, and later clay or iron pots), roasting over a fire or grilling over hot stones or coals. <a href="Fermentation%20%28food%29">Fermentation</a> was also used to create curds from milk, develop the flavor of certain dried or fresh tubers or produce alcoholic beverages from honey, sugar cane juice or other local plants. The techniques of sun curing (<a href="drying%20%28food%29">drying</a>), <a href="smoking%20%28food%29">smoking</a> and <a href="salting%20%28food%29">salting</a> were used to preserve various foods for transport, trade or future consumption. Many foods prepared in these ways, such as a smoked dried beef called "kitoza" () and salted dried fish, are still eaten in a similar form in modern-day Madagascar.

By the 16th century, centralized kingdoms had emerged on the west coast among the <a href="Sakalava">Sakalava</a> and in the Central highlands among the Merina. The <a href="List%20of%20Malagasy%20monarchs">Merina sovereigns</a> celebrated the new year with an ancient Merina ceremony called the Royal Bath ("<a href="fandroana">fandroana</a>"). For this ceremony, a beef <a href="confit">confit</a> called "jaka" () was prepared by placing beef in a decorative clay jar and sealing it with <a href="suet">suet</a>, then conserving it in an underground pit for a year. The jaka would be shared with friends at the following year's festival. As a dessert, revelers would eat rice boiled in milk and drizzled with honey, a preparation known as "tatao" (). According to oral history, King Ralambo was the originator of these culinary traditions in Imerina. Ralambo's father, King <a href="Andriamanelo">Andriamanelo</a>, is credited with introducing the marriage tradition of the "vodiondry" () or "rump of the sheep," wherein the most favored cut of meat—the hindquarters—was offered by the groom to the parents of the bride-to-be at an engagement ceremony. In contemporary Malagasy society the terminology persists but families are more likely to offer symbolic coins in place of an offering of food.

The advent of the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">trans-Atlantic slave trade</a> increased maritime trade at Malagasy ports, including food products. In 1696, a trading vessel en route to the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">American colonies</a> reportedly took a stock of local Malagasy rice to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, where the grain formed the basis of the plantation industry. Trading ships brought crops from the Americas—such as sweet potato, tomato, maize, peanuts, tobacco and <a href="lima%20bean">lima bean</a>s—to Madagascar in the 16th and 17th centuries; cassava arrived after 1735 from a French colony at nearby <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion Island</a>. These products were first cultivated in coastal areas nearest to their ports of arrival, but soon spread throughout the island; within 100 years of their introduction they were widespread throughout the central highlands. Similarly, pineapple and citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, oranges, consumed by sailors to ward off <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a> on long cross-Atlantic trips, were introduced at coastal Malagasy ports. Local cultivation began soon afterward.

The <a href="Opuntia">prickly pear cactus</a> or "raketa" (), also known in southern Madagascar as "sakafon-drano" () or "water food", was brought from the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> to the French settlement at <a href="T%C3%B4lanaro">Fort Dauphin</a> in 1769 by Frenchman Count Dolisie de Maudave. The plant spread throughout the southern part of the island, where it became a fundamental food crop for <a href="Mahafaly">Mahafaly</a> and <a href="Bara%20people">Bara</a> pastoralists. Consuming six or so of the fruits of this plant preempted the need to drink water, and once the spines had been removed, the <a href="wikt%3Acladode">cladodes</a> of the plant would nourish and hydrate the zebu cattle they tended. The introduction of this plant enabled the southern pastoralists to become more sedentary and efficient herders, thus boosting population density and cattle count in the region.

The 18th century in the central highlands was characterized by increasing population density and consequent <a href="famine">famine</a>s, aggravated by warring among the principalities of Imerina. At the turn of the 19th century, King <a href="Andrianampoinimerina">Andrianampoinimerina</a> (1787–1810) successfully united these fractious Merina groups under his rule, then used <a href="slavery">slaves</a> and <a href="unfree%20labor">forced labor</a>—exacted in lieu of taxes for those without means to offer material payment—to systematically work the irrigated rice fields around <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a>. In this way, he ensured regular grain surpluses that were sufficient to consistently feed the entire population and export products for trade with other regions of the island. Marketplaces were established across the island to serve as central trading points for designated commodities such as smoked and dried seafood and meats, dried maize, salt, dried cassava and various fruits. Rice cakes, including "mofo gasy" () and "menakely" (), were also sold by market vendors. By this period, coastal cuisine had likewise evolved: early 19th century voyagers reported eating dishes on <a href="%C3%8Ele%20Sainte-Marie">Île Sainte-Marie</a> prepared with curry powder (including a spiced rice resembling <a href="biryani">biryani</a>) and drinking coffee and tea.
Andrianampoinimerina's son, <a href="Radama%20I">Radama I</a>, succeeded in uniting nearly the entire island under his rule, and established the <a href="Merina%20Kingdom">Kingdom of Madagascar</a>. A line of Merina monarchs would continue to govern the island until its <a href="French%20Madagascar">colonization by the French</a> in 1896.

Under the Kingdom of Madagascar, <a href="plantation">plantation</a>s were established for the production of crops exported to foreign markets such as England and France. Cloves were imported and planted in 1803, and coconuts—which had been relatively sparse on the island—were cultivated on plantations for the production of oil. Similarly, coffee had been grown on family plots of four to five trees until the early 19th century, when more intensive cultivation for export began. <a href="Vanilla">Vanilla</a>, later to become one of Madagascar's premiere export crops, was introduced by French entrepreneurs in 1840 and planted in eastern coastal rainforests. The technique of <a href="hand%20pollination">hand pollination</a>, critical to higher vanilla yields, was introduced 30 years later. Nonetheless, vanilla remained a marginal crop until the end of the monarchy.

During Merina royal festivals, the "hanim-pito loha" () were eaten. These were seven dishes said to be the most desirable in the realm. Among these dishes were "voanjobory" (, Bambara groundnut), "amalona" (, eel), "vorivorinkena" (, beef <a href="tripe">tripe</a>), "ravitoto" (, grated cassava leaves) and "vorontsiloza" (, turkey), each cooked with pork and usually ginger, garlic, onion and tomato; "romazava" (, a stew of beef and <a href="leaf%20vegetable">greens</a>) and "varanga" (, shredded roast beef) completed the list. Colonization of Madagascar by the French meant the end of the Malagasy monarchy and its elaborate feasts, but the traditions of this elegant cuisine were preserved in the home, where these dishes are eaten regularly. They are also served in many restaurants throughout the island.

<a href="French%20colonial%20empire">French colonial rule</a> began in 1896 and introduced a number of innovations to local cuisines. Certain new food names derived from the French language—then the dominant language of the state—became widespread. Baguettes were popularized among cosmopolitan urbanites, as were a variety of French pastries and desserts such as cream horns, "<a href="mille-feuille">mille-feuille</a>", <a href="croissant">croissant</a>s and "chocolat chaud" (<a href="hot%20chocolate">hot chocolate</a>). The French also introduced <a href="foie%20gras">foie gras</a>, now produced locally, and popularized a dish known in the highlands as "composé": a cold macaroni salad mixed with blanched vegetables based on the French "<a href="Russian%20salad">macédoine de légumes</a>." The French established plantations for the cultivation of a variety of cash crops, including not only those already exploited in the 19th century, but new foreign fruits, vegetables and livestock, with varying degrees of success. Tea, coffee, vanilla, coconut oil and spices became successful exports. Coconut became a regular ingredient in coastal cuisine, and vanilla began to be used in sauces for poultry and seafood dishes.

Although a handful of <a href="Chinese%20people%20in%20Madagascar">Chinese settlers</a> had arrived in Madagascar towards the end of the reign of Queen <a href="Ranavalona%20III">Ranavalona III</a>, the first major influx of Chinese migrants followed an announcement by General <a href="Joseph%20Gallieni">Joseph Gallieni</a>, first governor general of the colony of Madagascar, requesting 3,000 Chinese laborers to construct a northern rail line between Antananarivo and <a href="Toamasina">Toamasina</a>. Chinese migrants introduced a number of dishes that have become part of urban popular cuisine in regions with large Chinese communities, including "riz cantonais" (Chinese <a href="fried%20rice">fried rice</a>), "soupe chinoise" (Chinese-style <a href="noodle%20soup">noodle soup</a>), "misao" (<a href="Misua">fried noodles</a>), "pao" (<a href="Baozi">hum bao</a>) and "nems" (fried <a href="egg%20roll">egg roll</a>s).

By the 1880s, a community of roughly 200 <a href="Indians%20in%20Madagascar">Indian</a> traders had been established at <a href="Mahajanga">Mahajanga</a>, a port on the north-west coast of Madagascar, near Bembatoka Bay at the mouth of the <a href="Betsiboka%20River">Betsiboka River</a>. Thirty years later the population of Indians in Madagascar had increased to over 4,000, concentrated along the trading ports of the northwestern coast. These early Indian communities popularized curries and biryanis throughout the region. "Khimo" in particular, a dish based on the Indian "<a href="keema">keema</a>", became a specialty of Mahajanga. Indian <a href="samosa">samosa</a>s ("sambos") soon became a popular street food in most parts of Madagascar, where they may also be known by the name "tsaky telozoro" (, "three-cornered snack").

While French innovations enriched the cuisine in many ways, not every innovation was favorable. Since the French introduction of the prickly pear cactus in the 18th century, the lifestyle of southern pastoralists became increasingly reliant on the plant to ensure food and water for their zebu as well as fruit and water for themselves during the dry season between July and December. However, in 1925, a French colonist wishing to eradicate the cactus on his property in the southwestern town of <a href="Toliara">Toliara</a> introduced the <a href="cochineal">cochineal</a>, an insect known to be a parasite of the plant. Within five years, nearly all the prickly pear cactus of southern Madagascar had been completely wiped out, sparking a massive famine from 1930–1931. Although these ethnic groups have since adapted in various ways, the famine period is commonly remembered as the time when their traditional lifestyle was ended by the arrival of foreigners on their land.

Since Madagascar gained independence from French colonial rule in 1960, Malagasy cuisine has reflected the island's diverse cultures and historic influences. Throughout the country, rice is considered the preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet in all but the most arid regions of the south and west. Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of ingredients and local cultural norms. Outside the home, Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls ("gargottes") or sit-down eateries ("hotely"). Snacks and rice-based meals may also be purchased from ambulatory street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique, ingredients and presentation alike.

Rice ("vary") is the cornerstone of the Malagasy diet and is typically consumed at every meal. The verb "to eat a meal" in the Malagasy language is commonly "mihinam-bary" – literally, to eat rice. Rice may be prepared with varying amounts of water to produce a fluffy dry rice ("vary maina", ) eaten with some kind of accompaniment (laoka) in sauce. It may also be prepared with extra water to produce a soupy rice porridge called "vary sosoa" () which is typically eaten for breakfast or prepared for the sick. "Vary sosoa" may be accompanied with a dry laoka such as kitoza, smoked strips of zebu meat. A popular variation, "vary amin'anana" (), is a traditional porridge made with rice, meat and chopped greens. During a highland <a href="famadihana">famadihana</a> (reburial ceremony), a special kind of rice called "vary be menaka" (, "rice with much fat") is rice served with fatty chunks of beef or preferably, highly fatty chunks of pork.

The accompaniment served with rice is called "laoka" in the highlands dialect, the official version of the <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy language</a>. Laoka are most often served in some kind of sauce: in the highlands, this sauce is generally tomato-based, while in coastal areas coconut milk is often added during cooking. In the arid southern and western interior where herding zebu is traditional, fresh or curdled zebu milk is often incorporated into vegetable dishes. Laoka are diverse and may include such ingredients as <a href="Bambara%20groundnut">Bambara groundnut</a>s with pork, beef or fish; "trondro gasy", (, various freshwater fish); shredded cassava leaves with peanuts, beef or pork; "henan'omby" (, beef) or "akoho" (, chicken) sauteed with ginger and garlic or simmered in its own juices (a preparation called "ritra" ); various types of seafood, which are more readily available along the coasts or in large urban centers; and many more. A variety of local greens such as "anamamy" (, Morelle greens), "anamafaitra" (, Martin greens) and particularly "anamalao" (, <a href="Acmella%20oleracea">paracress</a>)—distinguished by the mildly analgesic effect the boiled leaves and flowers produce—are commonly sold alongside "anandrano" (, <a href="watercress">watercress</a>) and "anatsonga" (, <a href="Chinese%20cabbage">bok choy</a>). In the arid south and west, such as among the <a href="Bara%20people">Bara</a> or <a href="Antandroy">Tandroy</a> peoples, staples include sweet potato, yams, taro root and especially cassava, <a href="millet">millet</a> and maize, generally boiled in water and occasionally served in whole milk or flavored with crushed peanuts.

Garlic, onions, ginger, tomatoes, mild curry, and salt are the most common ingredients used to flavor dishes, and in coastal areas other ingredients such as coconut milk, vanilla, cloves or <a href="turmeric">turmeric</a> may also be used. A variety of condiments are served on the side and mixed into the rice or laoka according to each individual's taste rather than mixing them in as the food is being cooked. The most common and basic condiment, "sakay" (), is a spicy condiment made from red or green chili pepper. Indian-style condiments made of pickled mango, lemon, and other fruits (known as "<a href="Indian%20pickle">achards</a>" or "lasary" ), are a coastal specialty; in the highlands, lasary often refers to a salad of green beans, cabbage, carrots and onion in a <a href="vinaigrette">vinaigrette</a> sauce, popular as a side dish or as the filling of a baguette sandwich.

"Ro" (, a broth) may be served as the main laoka or in addition to it to flavor and moisten the rice. "Ro-mangazafy" () is a rich and flavorful broth made with beef, tomato and garlic that often accompanies a dry laoka. By contrast, "Romatsatso" () is a light and relatively flavorless broth made with onion, tomato and anamamy greens served with meat or fatty poultry. "Ron-akoho" (), a broth made with chicken and ginger, is a home remedy for the common cold, while "rompatsa" ()—a broth made with tiny dried shrimp and beef, to which sweet potato leaves and potato are often added—is traditionally eaten by new mothers to support <a href="lactation">lactation</a>. The <a href="national%20dish">national dish</a> is the broth called "romazava", which in its simplest form is made of beef with anamalao, anantsonga or anamamy, although ingredients such as tomato, onion and ginger are commonly added to create more complex and flavorful versions. Romazava is distinguished by its inclusion of anamalao flowers, which produce a mild analgesic effect when the broth is consumed.

A variety of cakes and fritters collectively known as "mofo" (, meaning "bread") are available from kiosks in towns and cities across Madagascar. The most common is "mofo gasy", meaning "Malagasy bread", which is made from a batter of sweetened rice flour poured into greased circular molds and cooked over charcoal. Mofo gasy is a popular breakfast food and is often eaten with coffee, also sold at kiosks. In coastal areas this mofo is made with coconut milk and is known as "mokary" (). Other sweet mofo include a deep-fried doughnut called menakely and a fried dough ball called "mofo baolina" (), as well as a variety of fruit fritters, with pineapple and bananas among the most common fruits used. Savory mofo include "ramanonaka" (), a mofo gasy salted and fried in lard, and a fritter flavored with chopped greens, onions, tomatoes and chilies called "mofo sakay" (, meaning "spicy bread").

In marketplaces and gas stations one may find vendors selling "<a href="koba%20akondro">koba akondro</a>" (), a sweet made by wrapping a batter of ground peanuts, mashed bananas, honey and corn flour in <a href="banana%20leaf">banana leaves</a> and steaming or boiling the small cakes until the batter has set. Peanut brittle, dried bananas, balls of <a href="tamarind">tamarind</a> paste rolled in colored sugar, deep-fried wonton-type dough strings called "kaka pizon" (, meaning "pigeon droppings") also eaten in neighboring Reunion Island, and home-made yogurts, are all commonly sold on the street. In rural areas, steamed cassava or sweet potatoes are eaten, occasionally with fresh or sweetened condensed milk.

Traditionally, fresh fruit may be eaten after a meal as a dessert. Fresh sugarcane may also be chewed as a treat. A great variety of temperate and tropical fruits are grown locally and may be enjoyed fresh or sprinkled with sugar. Temperate fruits found in Madagascar include but are not limited to apples, lemons, pumpkins, watermelon, oranges, cherries and strawberries. Among the many tropical fruits commonly eaten in Madagascar are coconut, tamarind, mango, pineapple, avocado, passion fruit, and <a href="loquat">loquat</a>s, locally called "pibasy" (). Guava, <a href="longan">longan</a>s, <a href="lychee">lychee</a>s, <a href="persimmon">persimmon</a> and "pok-pok" (also called "voanantsindrana" ), a fruit similar to a <a href="physalis">physalis</a>, are common, while on the west coast the fruit of the baobab tree is eaten during the brief period when it becomes available near the end of the rainy season.

Madagascar is known for its high-quality cocoa and vanilla, much of which are exported. In the coastal areas of Madagascar or in upscale inland restaurants, vanilla may be used to prepare savory sauces for poultry.

"Koban-dravina" () or "koba" () is a Malagasy specialty made by grinding together peanuts and brown sugar, then enveloping the mixture in a sweetened rice flour paste to produce a cylindrical bundle. The bundle is wrapped in banana leaves and boiled for 24 to 48 hours or longer until the sugar becomes <a href="caramelization">caramelized</a> and the peanuts have softened. The resulting cake is served in thin slices. "Bonbon coco" is a popular candy made from shredded coconut cooked with caramelized sugar and formed into chewy balls or patties. A firm, cake-like coconut milk pudding known as "godro-godro" () is a popular dessert also found in Comoros. French pastries and cakes are very popular across the island and may be purchased at the many "<a href="p%C3%A2tisserie">pâtisserie</a>s" found in towns and cities throughout Madagascar.

"Ranon'ampango" () and "ranovola" (), are the most common and traditional beverages in Madagascar. Both are names for a drink made by adding hot water to the toasted rice left sticking to the interior of its cooking pot. This drink is a sanitary and tasty alternative to fresh water.

In addition, a variety of other drinks are produced locally. Coffee is grown in the eastern part of the island and has become a standard breakfast drink, served black or with sweetened condensed milk at street-side kiosks. Black tea, occasionally flavored with vanilla, and herbal teas—particularly <a href="lemongrass">lemongrass</a> and <a href="eucalyptus%20citriodora">lemon bush</a> ("ravin'oliva" )—are popular. Juices are made from <a href="guava">guava</a>, <a href="passion%20fruit">passion fruit</a>, pineapple, tamarind, baobab, and other fruit. Fresh milk, however, is a luxury, and locally produced yogurts, ice creams or sweetened condensed milk mixed with hot water are the most common dairy sources of calcium. Cola and orange soft drinks are produced locally, as is "Bonbon Anglais," a local sweet lemon soda. Coca-Cola products are popular and widely consumed throughout the island.

Numerous alcoholic beverages are produced for local consumption and limited export. The local <a href="pilsner">pilsner</a>, <a href="Three%20Horses%20Beer">Three Horses Beer</a>, is popular and ubiquitous. Wine is produced in the southern highlands around <a href="Fianarantsoa">Fianarantsoa</a>, and rum ("toaka gasy" ) is widely produced and can be either drunk neat, flavored with exotic fruits and spices to produce "rhum arrangé" or blended with coconut milk to make a "punch coco" cocktail. The most traditional form of rum, called "betsabetsa" , is made from fermented sugarcane juice. Rum serves a ritual purpose in many parts of Madagascar, where it is traditional to throw the first capful of a newly opened bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room as an offering and gesture of respect to the ancestors. At social gatherings it is common for alcoholic beverages to be accompanied with savory, fried snacks known collectively as "tsakitsaky", commonly including pan-fried peanuts, potato chips, nems, sambos and kaka pizon.

Crescent honeyeater

The crescent honeyeater ("Phylidonyris pyrrhopterus") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird of the honeyeater family, <a href="Meliphagidae">Meliphagidae</a>, native to southeastern <a href="Fauna%20of%20Australia">Australia</a>. A member of the genus "<a href="Phylidonyris">Phylidonyris</a>", it is most closely related to the common <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("P. novaehollandiae") and the <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked honeyeater</a> ("P. niger"). Two subspecies are recognized, with "P. p. halmaturinus" restricted in range to <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a> and the <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>.

It has dark grey <a href="plumage">plumage</a> and paler underparts, highlighted by yellow wing patches and a broad, black crescent, outlined in white, down the sides of its breast. The species exhibits slight <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, with the female being duller in colour than the male. Juvenile birds are similar to the female, though the yellow wing patches of male nestlings can be easily distinguished.

The male has a complex and variable <a href="bird%20vocalization">song</a>, which is heard throughout the year. It sings from an exposed perch, and during the breeding season performs song flights. The crescent honeyeater is found in areas of dense vegetation including <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest and <a href="Alpine%20plant">alpine</a> habitats, as well as <a href="heath">heath</a>land, and parks and gardens, where its diet is made up of <a href="nectar">nectar</a> and <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s. It forms <a href="pair%20bond">long-term pairs</a>, and often stays committed to one breeding site for several years. The female builds the <a href="nest">nest</a> and does most of the caring for the two to three young, which become <a href="fledge">independent</a> within 40 days of laying its egg.

The parent birds use a range of anti-predator strategies, but nestlings can be taken by snakes, <a href="kookaburra">kookaburra</a>s, <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s, or cats. While the crescent honeyeater faces a number of threats, its population numbers and distribution are sufficient for it to be listed as of "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>" for conservation.

The crescent honeyeater was originally described by ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in 1801 as "Certhia pyrrhoptera", because of an assumed relationship with the <a href="treecreeper">treecreeper</a>s, "Certhia". It was later named "Certhia australasiana" by <a href="George%20Shaw">George Shaw</a> in 1812, "Melithreptus melanoleucus" by <a href="Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</a> in 1817, and "Meliphaga inornata" by <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> in 1838. The generic term comes from the French "phylidonyre", which combines the names for a honeyeater and a <a href="sunbird">sunbird</a> (previously thought to belong to the same family). The specific epithet is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> <a href="word%20stem">stems</a> "pyrrhos", meaning "fire", and "pteron", meaning "wing", in reference to the yellow wing patches. Some guidebooks have the <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> name written as "Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera"; however, a review in 2001 ruled that the genus name was masculine, hence "pyrrhopterus" is the correct specific name. Two subspecies are recognised, the nominate form "P. p. pyrrhopterus" over most of its range, and "P. p. halmaturinus" which is restricted to <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a> and the <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a>.

A 2004 molecular study showed its close relatives to be the <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> and the <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked honeyeater</a>, the three forming the now small genus "Phylidonyris". A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the <a href="white-streaked%20honeyeater">white-streaked honeyeater</a> to also lie within the clade. The ancestor of the crescent honeyeater diverged from the lineage giving rise to the white-streaked, New Holland and white-cheeked honeyeaters around 7.5 million years ago. <a href="DNA">DNA</a> analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the <a href="Pardalotidae">Pardalotidae</a> (pardalotes), <a href="Acanthizidae">Acanthizidae</a> (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and <a href="Maluridae">Maluridae</a> (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily <a href="Meliphagoidea">Meliphagoidea</a>.

Other common names for the crescent honeyeater include chinawing, Egypt and horseshoe honeyeater. Gould called it the Tasmanian honeyeater.

The crescent honeyeater measures , in length, with a wingspan of , and weighs about . It is <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>, with the female a paler version of the male. The male is dark grey with clear yellow wing-patches with a broad, black crescent, outlined in white, down the sides of its breast, and a white streak above his eye. The top of the tail is black, with yellow edges to the feathers forming distinctive yellow panels on the sides of the tail. White tips on the undertail are usually only visible in flight. The underparts are pale brownish-grey fading to white. The female is duller, olive brown with faded yellow wing patches with similar, though less clear, crescentic markings. Both sexes have dark grey legs and feet, deep ruby eyes and a long, downcurved black bill. The <a href="gape">gape</a> is also black. Young birds are similar to the adults, though not as strongly marked, and have dark grey bills, duller brown eyes and yellow gapes. Male nestlings can be distinguished by their more extensive yellow wing patches from seven days old. <a href="Moulting">Moulting</a> patterns of the species are poorly known; crescent honeyeaters appear to replace their primary flight feathers between October and January.

While both subspecies have the same general appearance, the female of "halmaturinus" has paler plumage than the nominate race, and both male and female have a smaller wing and tail and longer bill. The "halmaturinus" population on Kangaroo Island has a significantly shorter wing and longer bill than the Mount Lofty population, although this size variation of an <a href="Island">insular</a> form is at odds with <a href="Allen%27s%20rule">Allen's</a> and <a href="Bergmann%27s%20rule">Bergmann's</a> rules.

The crescent honeyeater has a range of musical calls and songs. One study recorded chatter <a href="Alarm%20signal">alarm calls</a> similar to the <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a>, a number of harsh <a href="Syllable">monosyllabic</a> or <a href="Syllable">tri-syllabic</a> <a href="contact%20calls">contact calls</a>, and complex and diverse songs. The most common contact call is a loud, carrying "e-gypt", while the alarm call is a sharp and rapid "chip-chip-chip". The male also has a melodic <a href="bird%20vocalization">song</a> which is heard throughout the year, at any time of the day. The structure of the song is complex and diverse, and includes both a descending whistle and a musical two-note call. The male's song is performed from an exposed perch or within the tree <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a>, and it engages in mating displays (song flights) during the breeding season. When the female is on the nest and the male nearby, they utter low soft notes identified as "whisper song".

There are records of scattered populations of the crescent honeyeater on the <a href="Central%20Tablelands">Central Tablelands</a>, the <a href="Mid%20North%20Coast">Mid North Coast</a>, and in the <a href="Hunter%20Region">Hunter Region</a> of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, and it is widespread in the areas of New South Wales south of <a href="Dharug%20National%20Park">Dharug National Park</a> and east of <a href="Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bathurst</a>. In <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> it is widespread across an area from the NSW border south west to <a href="Wallan%2C%20Victoria">Wallan</a> with scattered populations recorded further west. It is widespread in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, except in the north-east part of the state where it is more sparsely distributed. It is restricted to sclerophyll forest in eastern South Australia, where isolated populations have been recorded in the <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> and on <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a>. Local influxes have occurred outside its normal range in response to changes in habitat. Recorded population densities range from near <a href="Orbost%2C%20Victoria">Orbost</a>, to in <a href="Boola%20Boola%20State%20Forest">Boola Boola State Forest</a>, also in Victoria.

While the crescent honeyeater occupies a wide variety of habitats including coastal <a href="Heath%20%28habitat%29">heath</a>, <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>, wet <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest, mountain forest, <a href="Alpine%20climate">alpine</a> <a href="woodland">woodland</a>, damp gullies and thick <a href="Melaleuca">tea-tree</a> scrub, they all demonstrate its preference for dense vegetation. It has been frequently recorded in wet sclerophyll forest dominated by <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a>s and with a thick mid-story and <a href="understory">understory</a> of shrubs such as <a href="Acacia%20melanoxylon">blackwood</a>, <a href="Acacia%20dealbata">silver wattle</a>, "<a href="Cassinia">Cassinia</a>", "<a href="Prostanthera">Prostanthera</a>", and "<a href="Correa%20%28plant%29">Correa</a>". At higher altitudes it occurs in alpine heathlands and in woodlands of stunted eucalypt or conifers.

The movements of the crescent honeyeater within its range are incompletely known. There is widespread evidence of seasonal migration to lower altitudes in cooler months, yet a proportion of the population remains sedentary. Autumn and winter migration to the lowland coastal areas is seen in southern Tasmania, where it is not unusual to see it in urban parks and gardens, as well as <a href="Gippsland">Gippsland</a>, and the New South Wales <a href="Central%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Central</a> and <a href="South%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">South Coast</a>. In the Sydney region, some birds appear to move down from the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Blue Mountains</a> to Sydney for the cooler months, yet others remain in either location for the whole year. It is only seen in alpine and subalpine areas of the <a href="Snowy%20Mountains">Snowy Mountains</a> in warmer snow-free months (mainly October to April). Other populations of crescent honeyeaters follow a more nomadic pattern of following food sources; this has been recorded in the Blue Mountains and parts of Victoria.

Crescent honeyeaters occupy territories during the breeding season of July to March, with pairs often staying on in the territory at the end of the season and committing to one breeding site for several years. <a href="Bird%20ringing">Banding</a> studies have recaptured birds within metres of the nest in which they were raised, and one female was re-trapped at the banding place almost ten years later. The pairs nest solitarily, or in loose colonies with nests around apart. The male defends the territory, which is used both for foraging and breeding, though during the breeding season he is more active in protecting the area, and therefore much more vocal. During courtship the male performs song flights, soaring with quivering wings and continuously calling with a high piping note.

The female builds the nest close to the boundary of the territory, usually near water, low in the shrubs. It is a deep, cup-shaped, bulky nest of cobweb, bark, grass, twigs, roots and other plant materials, lined with grass, down, moss and fur. The long strips of bark from <a href="stringybark">stringybark</a> or <a href="messmate">messmate</a> trees are often used. The <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> size is 2 or 3, occasionally 4. Measuring by , the eggs are pale pink, sometimes buff-tinged, with lavender and chestnut splotches. The base colour is darker at the larger end. The female <a href="Egg%20incubation%23Avian%20incubation">incubates</a> and broods the eggs, but both sexes feed the nestlings and remove <a href="fecal%20sac">fecal sac</a>s, although the female does the majority of caring for the young. The young birds are fed <a href="insectivore">insects</a>, with flies making up much of the regurgitated material according to one study. The incubation period is 13 days, followed by a fledging period of 13 days. The parent birds feed the fledglings for around two weeks after they leave the nest, but the young do not remain long in the parents' territory. The young are independent within 40 days of egg-laying.

Parent birds have been observed using a range of anti-<a href="predation">predator</a> strategies: the female staying on the nest until almost touched; one or other of the pair performing distraction displays, fluttering wings and moving across the ground; the female flying rapidly at the intruder; and both birds giving harsh scolding calls when a <a href="kookaburra">kookaburra</a>, <a href="tiger%20snake">tiger snake</a> or <a href="currawong">currawong</a> approached. The nests of the crescent honeyeater are usually low in the shrubs, which makes the birds and their young vulnerable to predation by birds and snakes; however, domestic and feral cats are the most likely predators to hunt this species.

Crescent honeyeaters pair in long-term relationships that often last for the whole year; however, while they are socially <a href="Monogamy">monogamous</a> they appear to be sexually <a href="Promiscuity">promiscuous</a>. One study found that only 42% of the nestlings were sired by the male partner at the nest despite <a href="Parent">paternity</a> guards such as pairing and territorial defence. The crescent honeyeaters observed exhibited a number of characteristics consistent with genetic promiscuity: sexual dimorphism, with sex-specific plumages identifiable at nestling stage; reduced male contribution to feeding and caring for the young; vigorous defence of the territory by the male; and frequent intrusions into other territories by females which were tolerated by the males holding those territories.

The crescent honeyeater is arboreal, foraging mainly among the foliage and flowers in the <a href="understory">understory</a> and tree canopy on nectar, fruits and small insects. It has been recorded eating the <a href="Honeydew%20%28secretion%29">honeydew</a> of <a href="psyllidae">psyllids</a>, <a href="Coccidae">soft scale</a> and <a href="Eriococcidae">felt scale insects</a>. It feeds primarily by probing flowers for nectar, and <a href="Gleaning%20%28birds%29">gleaning</a> foliage and bark and <a href="Hawking%20%28birds%29">sallying</a> for insects. While regularly observed feeding singly or in pairs, the crescent honeyeater has also been recorded moving in loose feeding flocks, and gathering in large groups at productive food sources. A study in forest near <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a> in Tasmania found that the crescent honeyeater's diet was wholly composed of insects during the breeding season, but nectar was a significant component during winter. Insects consumed include moths and flies, and the tree trunks were the site of foraging around two-thirds of the time, and foliage a third. It fed on nectar as plants came into flower in the autumn and winter, and then foraged in Tasmanian blue gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20globulus">Eucalyptus globulus</a>") during the breeding season in spring. The flowering of royal grevillea ("<a href="Grevillea%20victoriae">Grevillea victoriae</a>") over summer in subalpine areas in the <a href="Snowy%20Mountains">Snowy Mountains</a> attracted large numbers of crescent honeyeaters. It feeds intensively when sources are plentiful and when feeding on flame heath ("<a href="Astroloma%20conostephioides">Astroloma conostephioides</a>") it was recorded visiting an average of 34 flowers per minute. Other plants it has been recorded visiting include a number of "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" species, waratah ("<a href="Waratah">Telopea</a>"), tubular flowered genera including "<a href="Astroloma">Astroloma</a>", "<a href="Epacris">Epacris</a>" and "<a href="Correa%20%28plant%29">Correa</a>", mistletoes of the genus "<a href="Amyema">Amyema</a>", and eucalypts in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. In <a href="Bondi%20State%20Forest">Bondi State Forest</a> it was also recorded feeding at cluster-flower geebung ("<a href="Persoonia%20confertiflora">Persoonia confertiflora</a>"), native holly ("<a href="Lomatia%20ilicifolia">Lomatia ilicifolia</a>"), tall shaggy-pea ("<a href="Oxylobium%20arborescens">Oxylobium arborescens</a>"), silver wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20dealbata">Acacia dealbata</a>") and blackthorn ("<a href="Bursaria%20spinosa">Bursaria spinosa</a>"). Local differences in flower foraging patterns have been observed in South Australia; populations on Kangaroo Island forage more often at "<a href="Adenanthos">Adenanthos</a>" flowers than those in the nearby <a href="Fleurieu%20Peninsula">Fleurieu Peninsula</a>, while the latter forage more often at eucalypt blooms, and at a higher diversity of plants overall.

While the population numbers and distribution are sufficient for the crescent honeyeater to be listed as of "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>" for conservation, numbers have fluctuated significantly over the past twenty-five years and currently seem to be in decline. The threats to the crescent honeyeater include habitat destruction, as the alpine forests in which it breeds are being reduced by weed infestations, severe bush fires, drought and land clearing. The crescent honeyeater's dependence on long-term partnerships and breeding territories means that breeding success is threatened by the death of one partner or the destruction of habitual territory. The influx of birds to urban areas also places them at increased risk of accidents and predation. Cats have been recorded preying on crescent honeyeaters, and at least one guide urges cat owners to keep their cats in enclosures when outside the house or to provide a stimulating indoor environment for them.

Enthiran

Enthiran () is a 2010 Indian <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a>-language <a href="Science%20fiction%20film">science fiction</a> <a href="action%20film">action film</a> written and directed by <a href="S.%20Shankar">S. Shankar</a>. It is the first installment in the <a href="Enthiran%20%28franchise%29">"Enthiran" franchise</a>. The film stars <a href="Rajinikanth">Rajinikanth</a> and <a href="Aishwarya%20Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a> in lead roles; <a href="Danny%20Denzongpa">Danny Denzongpa</a>, <a href="Santhanam%20%28actor%29">Santhanam</a> and <a href="Karunas">Karunas</a> play supporting roles. The <a href="Enthiran%20%28soundtrack%29">soundtrack album and background score</a> were composed by <a href="A.%20R.%20Rahman">A. R. Rahman</a> while the dialogues, cinematography, editing and art direction were handled by <a href="Madhan%20Karky">Madhan Karky</a>, <a href="R.%20Rathnavelu">R. Rathnavelu</a>, <a href="Anthony%20%28film%20editor%29">Anthony</a> and <a href="Sabu%20Cyril">Sabu Cyril</a> respectively.

The story revolves around the struggle of scientist Vaseegaran (played by Rajinikanth) to control his creation, an <a href="Android%20%28robot%29">android</a> named <a href="Chitti%20%28character%29">Chitti</a> (also played by Rajinikanth), after Chitti's software is upgraded to give it the ability to comprehend and exhibit human emotions. The project backfires when the robot falls in love with the scientist's girlfriend (Rai), and is manipulated by Bohra (Denzongpa), a rival scientist, into becoming homicidal.

After being stalled in the <a href="development%20hell">development</a> phase for nearly a decade, the film's principal photography began in 2008 and lasted two years. The film marked the debut of <a href="Legacy%20Effects">Legacy Effects</a> studio (which was responsible for the film's <a href="Facial%20prosthetic">prosthetic make-up</a> and <a href="animatronics">animatronics</a>) in Indian cinema. "Enthiran" was released worldwide on 1 October 2010, along with its <a href="dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">dubbed</a> versions: "Robot" in <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> and "Robo" in <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>. Produced by <a href="Kalanithi%20Maran">Kalanithi Maran</a>, it was India's <a href="List%20of%20most%20expensive%20Indian%20films">most expensive film</a> up to that point.

The film received generally positive reviews upon release. Critics were particularly appreciative of Rajinikanth's performance, Rathnavelu's cinematography, Cyril's art direction and the visual effects by <a href="V.%20Srinivas%20Mohan">V. Srinivas Mohan</a>. "Enthiran" emerged as the top-earning Indian film of 2010 and is the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films%23Highest-grossing%20Tamil%20films">fourth-highest-grossing</a> <a href="Cinema%20of%20South%20India">South Indian film</a> of all time. It won two <a href="National%20Film%20Awards">Indian National Film Awards</a>, three <a href="Filmfare%20Awards%20South">Filmfare Awards</a>, seven <a href="Vijay%20Awards">Vijay Awards</a> and two <a href="Screen%20Awards">Screen Awards</a>. "Enthiran" was followed up by its <a href="Standalone%20film%23Standalone%20sequel">standalone sequel</a>, "<a href="2.0%20%28film%29">2.0</a>", which released in 2018.

After a decade of research, the scientist Vaseegaran creates a sophisticated <a href="android%20%28robot%29">android robot</a> with the help of his assistants, Siva and Ravi, to commission it into the <a href="Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a>. He introduces the robot, named <a href="Chitti%20%28character%29">Chitti</a>, at a robotics conference in <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a>. Chitti helps Sana, Vaseegaran's <a href="Medical%20school%23Medical%20students">medical student</a> girlfriend, cheat in her examination, then saves her from being assaulted by a group of thugs. Vaseegaran's mentor, Professor Bohra, is secretly engaged in a project to create similar android robots for a terrorist organisation, but has so far been unsuccessful.

Vaseegaran prepares Chitti for an evaluation by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which is headed by Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti attempts to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the evaluation committee that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes. Vaseegaran's effort to prove Bohra wrong fails when he deploys Chitti to rescue people from a burning building. The robot saves most of them, including a girl named Selvi who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked on camera and flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's <a href="image%20schema">neural schema</a> to enable it to understand human behaviour and emotions, to which Bohra agrees. While nearing the deadline, Chitti becomes angry with Vaseegaran, demonstrating to him that it can manifest emotions.

Chitti uses Sana's textbooks to successfully help Sana's sister Latha give birth to a child. Bohra congratulates Vaseegaran on the achievement and allows Chitti to pass the AIRD evaluation. Chitti develops romantic feelings for Sana after she congratulates Chitti by kissing it. When Vaseegaran and Sana realise this, Sana explains to Chitti that they are only friends. Saddened by Sana's rejection, yet still in love with her, Chitti deliberately fails an evaluation conducted by the Indian Army. Enraged, Vaseegaran chops Chitti into pieces, which are dumped by Siva and Ravi into a landfill site.

Bohra visits the site to retrieve Chitti, which has now reassembled itself, albeit in a damaged state. Bohra embeds a red chip inside Chitti while reconstructing it, converting it into version 2.0, which is more aggressive and unempathetic. It then gatecrashes Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding, kidnaps Sana, creates replicas of itself and kills Bohra. Using its robot army, Chitti occupies AIRD and causes mayhem in the city. After informing Sana that it has acquired the human ability to reproduce, Chitti wishes to marry her so that a machine and a human being can give birth to a preprogrammed child, but Sana refuses. It eventually finds Vaseegaran, who entered AIRD to stop it, and nearly kills him before the police appear. The ensuing battle between Chitti's robot army and the police personnel leads to a lot of property destruction and many casualties. Vaseegaran eventually captures Chitti using a magnetic wall and accesses its internal control panel, whereby he instructs all the other robots to self-destruct. He then removes Chitti's red chip, calming it.

In a court hearing, Vaseegaran is sentenced to death for the casualties and damages caused by the robot army, but Chitti explains that it was Bohra who caused its deviant behaviour and shows the court video footage of Bohra installing the red chip. The court releases Vaseegaran, while ordering that Chitti be dismantled. Left with no choice, Vaseegaran asks Chitti to dismantle itself. While saying goodbye, Chitti apologises to Vaseegaran and Sana, who forgive it, before dismantling itself.

The film's setting then shifts to 2030. Chitti is now a museum exhibit. A curious school student on excursion asks her guide why it was dismantled, to which Chitti responds, ""Naan sinthikka arambichen"" ("I started thinking").


Following the completion of his first directorial venture in Hindi, "<a href="Nayak%20%282001%20Hindi%20film%29">Nayak</a>" (2001), <a href="S.%20Shankar">S. Shankar</a> announced his next project, "Robot", which was to feature <a href="Kamal%20Haasan">Kamal Haasan</a> and <a href="Preity%20Zinta">Preity Zinta</a>. The film was to be produced by the now-defunct company Media Dreams, a division of <a href="Pentamedia%20Graphics">Pentamedia Graphics</a>. The film was reported to be a futuristic <a href="techno-thriller">techno-thriller</a> set in Chennai in around 2200 or 3000 <a href="Anno%20Domini">AD</a>. Despite the completion of a photoshoot featuring Haasan and Zinta, the project was shelved as a result of scheduling conflicts with Haasan. Shankar consequently started work on "<a href="Boys%20%282003%20film%29">Boys</a>" (2003).

After "Boys", Shankar began work on his next feature starring <a href="Vikram%20%28actor%29">Vikram</a>, which was initially reported by <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> to be "Robot" revived, but was later revealed as "<a href="Anniyan">Anniyan</a>" (2005). One month post the release of his action film "<a href="Sivaji%20%28film%29">Sivaji</a>" in June 2007, he approached <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> for the lead in "Robot". Khan was about to produce it under his own banner, <a href="Red%20Chillies%20Entertainment">Red Chillies Entertainment</a>, but in October the same year the project was officially aborted due to creative differences between the two.

The project was revived in January 2008 with <a href="Eros%20International">Eros International</a> and the <a href="London">London</a>-based production company <a href="Ayngaran%20International">Ayngaran International</a> willing to produce the film. The state government of <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> granted tax exemptions for films titled in <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a>, resulting in the new production being renamed "Enthiran". While <a href="Sujatha%20Rangarajan">Sujatha Rangarajan</a> was originally assigned to write the dialogue for the film, <a href="Madhan%20Karky">Madhan Karky</a> took over after Rangarajan's death in February 2008. In December 2008, Eros International withdrew from funding the project after financial difficulties caused by the box-office failure of "<a href="Drona%20%282008%20film%29">Drona</a>" (2008) and "<a href="Yuvvraaj">Yuvvraaj</a>" (2008), with the subsequent departure of Ayngaran International, which struggled with the <a href="Financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008">global financial crisis of 2007–08</a>. The film's production and release rights were sold to <a href="Sun%20Pictures">Sun Pictures</a>.

In January 2008, <a href="Rajinikanth">Rajinikanth</a> accepted the lead role in the film for a salary of 450 million (<a href="Indian%20rupee">Indian rupee</a>s). Shankar rewrote the original script to suit Rajinikanth's acting style. In an interview with the Tamil channel <a href="Sun%20TV%20%28India%29">Sun TV</a>, held shortly after the film's release in October 2010, Rajinikanth revealed that Shankar, following the release of his "<a href="Indian%20%281996%20film%29">Indian</a>" in 1996, had approached and pitched three storylines for him to consider for his next venture. Rajinikanth was impressed with two of the scripts and agreed to star in the films, which became "Sivaji" and "Enthiran". The third script narrated by Shankar focused on an aspiring bodybuilder; it eventually became "<a href="I%20%28film%29">I</a>" (2015).

Although <a href="Aishwarya%20Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a> was Shankar's original choice for the female lead in 2001, she declined it owing to a busy schedule and was replaced by Zinta. When Shankar revived the project with Rajinikanth, contenders for the part included <a href="Priyanka%20Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a>, <a href="Deepika%20Padukone">Deepika Padukone</a>, <a href="Shriya%20Saran">Shriya Saran</a> and Rai, who was ultimately selected and paid 60 million. Rai's voice was dubbed by <a href="Savitha%20Reddy">Savitha Reddy</a>.

Several actors were considered for the role of Professor Bohra, including <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, <a href="J.%20D.%20Chakravarthy">J. D. Chakravarthy</a>, <a href="Sathyaraj">Sathyaraj</a> and British actor <a href="Ben%20Kingsley">Ben Kingsley</a>, but it was <a href="Danny%20Denzongpa">Danny Denzongpa</a> who eventually received it, making "Enthiran" his first film in Tamil. Dubbing for Denzongpa was provided by Kadhir. Comedians <a href="Santhanam%20%28actor%29">Santhanam</a> and <a href="Karunas">Karunas</a> were cast to portray Vaseegaran's assistants Siva and Ravi respectively.

The soundtrack album and background score were composed by A. R. Rahman. <a href="Vairamuthu">Vairamuthu</a>, <a href="P.%20Vijay">P. Vijay</a> and Madhan Karky authored the lyrics for the songs. <a href="Manoj%20Bharathiraja">Manoj Bharathiraja</a>, son of filmmaker <a href="P.%20Bharathiraja">P. Bharathiraja</a>, was signed on to be an assistant director after he approached Shankar. Also working as assistant directors were <a href="Atlee%20%28director%29">Atlee</a>, Shree and Karthik G. Krish. <a href="Sabu%20Cyril">Sabu Cyril</a>, in addition to being the film's art director, made a guest appearance as Shah, an interpreter between Bohra and the terrorist organisation.

<a href="R.%20Rathnavelu">R. Rathnavelu</a> was hired as the cinematographer after <a href="Ravi%20K.%20Chandran">Ravi K. Chandran</a>, <a href="Nirav%20Shah">Nirav Shah</a> and <a href="Thiru">Thiru</a> were considered. <a href="Anthony%20%28film%20editor%29">Anthony</a> was the film's editor. <a href="Yuen%20Woo-ping">Yuen Woo-ping</a>, known for his work in <a href="The%20Matrix%20%28franchise%29">"The Matrix" trilogy</a> and the "" films, was selected to be the stunt co-ordinator, while <a href="Legacy%20Effects">Legacy Effects</a>, a visual effects studio based in the United States, were in charge of the <a href="prosthetic%20make-up">prosthetic make-up</a> and animatronics in the film. <a href="Munich">Munich</a>-based film technical company, <a href="Panther%20%28company%29">Panther</a>, were responsible for the <a href="crane%20shot">crane shot</a>s. The film's <a href="Subtitle%20%28captioning%29">subtitle captioning</a> was done by Rekha Haricharan.

<a href="Manish%20Malhotra">Manish Malhotra</a> and Mary E. Vogt were chosen to design the film's costumes. Fifty-seven costumes were used for Rai, including a "Mexican tribal" look that she sported during the filming of the "<a href="Kilimanjaro%20%28song%29">Kilimanjaro</a>" segment. According to make-up artist <a href="Banu%20%28make-up%20artist%29">Banu</a>, no prosthetics were used for Rajinikanth to avoid bothering him by withholding his time on set. Additional make-up was by Vance Hartwell, an employee of Legacy Effects.

The visual appearance of Chitti was based on the <a href="G.I.%20Joe">G.I. Joe</a> <a href="action%20figure">action figure</a>s. For Chitti's "villain robot" look, its hair was spiked and brown coloured lenses were used for its eyes, whereas for its "good robot" look, green coloured lenses were used. The wig used for Chitti's "villain robot" look had a silver streak in the middle, made out of <a href="Yak">Yak</a> hair, while its leather jacket was designed by Vogt. To make Vaseegaran look mature, the team made Rajinikanth sport an <a href="Beard%23Styles">Oakley beard</a>. Suits made of copper were used for Chitti's costumes.

For Sabu Cyril's sets, Shankar required approximately twice as much studio floor space as for his previous film. After rejecting <a href="Ramoji%20Film%20City">Ramoji Film City</a> for technical reasons, "Enthiran" producer, <a href="Kalanithi%20Maran">Kalanithi Maran</a>, took six months to set up three air-conditioned studio floors on land in <a href="Perungudi">Perungudi</a> owned by Sun TV Network. Filming began on 15 February 2008 at <a href="AVM%20Productions">AVM Studios</a> in Chennai. After the initial stages of filming, Shankar and Rathnavelu toured the world for three weeks, scouting for exotic filming locations. They visited Austria, Germany, Peru, Brazil and Argentina, looking for a backdrop to shoot the "Kilimanjaro" and "Kadhal Anukkal" segments, eventually deciding on Peru and Brazil. "Kilimanjaro" was filmed at the ruins of the <a href="Inca%20Empire">Incan</a> city of <a href="Machu%20Picchu">Machu Picchu</a> in Peru, with some 100 Brazilian extras. It was choreographed by <a href="Raju%20Sundaram">Raju Sundaram</a> and supervised by Fernando Astete, director of the Machu Picchu archaeological park. "Kadhal Anukkal" was filmed in <a href="Len%C3%A7%C3%B3is%20Maranhenses%20National%20Park">Lençóis Maranhenses National Park</a> in northeastern Brazil.

The filming for Chitti's introduction to the international robotics conference was completed in December 2008 at <a href="Sri%20Sivasubramaniya%20Nadar%20College%20of%20Engineering">Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering</a> and <a href="Vellore%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Vellore Institute of Technology</a>, where more than 400 students were used as extras. Further footage was shot over five days at the <a href="Ennore%20Port">Ennore Port</a> on the <a href="Mitsui%20O.S.K.%20Lines">Mitsui O.S.K. Lines</a> car carrier, "Neptune Ace". An action sequence where Chitti saves Sana from thugs was filmed in <a href="Lonavla">Lonavla</a>, under the supervision of the action choreographer <a href="Peter%20Hein">Peter Hein</a>. Scenes featuring Rajinikanth as Chitti were captured over five days at the <a href="Perungudi%23Dump%20Yard">Perungudi Dump Yard</a> in Chennai. Sabu Cyril told Uma Kannan of "<a href="The%20New%20Indian%20Express">The New Indian Express</a>" that the sets for the climax sequence, which was filmed at <a href="Mayajaal">Mayajaal</a>, consisted of a tar road and glass buildings which rose to , and that <a href="Sandwich%20panel">aluminium composite panels</a>, reported to have cost 50 million, were also used to design the sets.

The set for "<a href="Arima%20Arima">Arima Arima</a>", a sequence choreographed by <a href="Prabhu%20Deva">Prabhu Deva</a>, was designed and constructed by Cyril at Ramoji Film City. Filming of the number took place over 22 days in April 2009. Junior artists were employed by Rathnavelu to wear masks of Rajinikanth. For the sequence entitled "Irumbile Oru Irudhaiyam", choreographed by <a href="Remo%20D%27Souza">Remo D'Souza</a> and featuring Rai and Rajinikanth as Chitti, three different sets were used: one of copper, one of gold and one in silver. The musical number, which was filmed in AVM Studios for eight days, was the last portion of the film's principal photography. D'Souza incorporated the <a href="popping">popping</a> style of <a href="street%20dance">street dance</a>s, but encountered difficulties in performing the dance movements in tandem with the robot, and with the restrictions created by the rigid costumes. Principal photography ended on 7 July 2010.

Impressed with the film's script, <a href="V.%20Srinivas%20Mohan">V. Srinivas Mohan</a> became the visual effects supervisor in December 2007. He asked Shankar to increase the filming schedules by six months to include pre-production requirements. Both Mohan and Shankar visited several visual effects companies, including the New Zealand-based <a href="Weta%20Digital">Weta Digital</a> and the United States-based <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a>, <a href="Cafe%20FX">Cafe FX</a> and <a href="Tippett%20Studio">Tippett Studio</a> before partnering with Legacy Effects. The original Eros-Ayngaran visual effects budget was 700 million, but after Sun Pictures took over production, it was significantly reduced to 200 million. As a result, the visual effects team had to omit and alter some sequences, making Chitti wear sunglasses for most of the film to reduce the cost and difficultly of animating his eyes.

After a series of <a href="Previsualization">previsualisation</a> tests, including a scene in which Chitti jumps on a train to save Sana, Mohan eventually decided to use the technique in 40 out of the 60 visual effects scenes featured in the film, consisting of 2,000 takes. Further previsualisation supervision was conducted by P. C. Sanath of Firefly Creative Studios, a visual effects company based in <a href="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a>. <a href="Storyboard%23Creation">3D storyboards</a> were constructed using 3D animation programs for every scene in the film and were shot from different angles. In an interview with Malathi Rangarajan of "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>", Mohan said that all of the pre-production work took one-and-a-half years to complete.

Rathnavelu used the <a href="Arriflex%20435%23435%20Xtreme">435 Xtreme</a> camera and also wrote a 1,600-page manual, in which he listed all of the possible angles from where he could film the characters Rajinikanth played. Legacy Effects and the Hong Kong-based visual effects companies Kinomotive Studios and Menfond Electronics took responsibility for the film's <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a> work. To create the robots with Rajinikanth's appearance, a complete scan of his face in 3D digital format in all possible lighting conditions was conducted using the Doom Light Stage, so that his face could be replicated on the <a href="mannequin">mannequin</a>s. The technique, according to Shankar, was previously used in "<a href="The%20Curious%20Case%20of%20Benjamin%20Button%20%28film%29">The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</a>" (2008). The robot Chitti featured in the film was a mannequin made by a Legacy Effects team of 100 technicians in Los Angeles. For every robotic mannequin used, six puppeteers were employed to control the mannequin's movements.

"Enthiran" focuses on the battle between man and machine. Despite Shankar's claim that "Enthiran" was a purely original idea, it has been compared to <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>'s 1818 novel "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>", owing to the similar personae of Chitti and <a href="Frankenstein%27s%20monster">Frankenstein's monster</a>, both of which turn against their respective creators. K. Moti Gokulsing and Wimal Dissanayake, in their book "Routledge Handbook of Indian Cinemas", noted the similarity between the two works, arguing that Chitti was "manipulated by Bohra to become a Frankenstein-like figure". Writing for "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>", Genevieve Koski observed, "The plot of "Enthiran" is essentially "Frankenstein" via <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">[Isaac] Asimov</a>'s <a href="Three%20Laws%20of%20Robotics">Three Laws of Robotics</a>."

Director and film critic <a href="Sudhish%20Kamath">Sudhish Kamath</a> called "Enthiran" "a superhero film, a sci-fi adventure, a triangular love story with a hint of the <a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a>", while remarking that "Enthiran" similarities to "<a href="The%20Terminator">The Terminator</a>" (1984) were "more than obvious. Not just visually—where we see the Superstar with one human eye and one scarred metallic eye but also intentionally spelt out when the bad robot announces that he has created Terminators." Kamath compared two of the film's robots to <a href="C-3PO">C-3PO</a> and <a href="R2-D2">R2-D2</a>, <a href="droid%20%28Star%20Wars%29">droids</a> from the "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" film series, which was referenced in "Enthiran" when Vaseegaran refers to one of his creations as "R2".

Although Shankar initially claimed that "Enthiran" would be made for all audiences, including those lacking <a href="computer%20literacy">computer literacy</a>, the film is influenced by and makes references to many scientific principles relating to the fields of engineering, computer science and robotics, including <a href="terabyte">terabyte</a>s and Asimov's laws of robotics. Visual references are made to the <a href="science%20book">science book</a>s "<a href="A%20Briefer%20History%20of%20Time%20%28Hawking%20and%20Mlodinow%20book%29">A Briefer History of Time</a>" (2005) and "<a href="Freakonomics">Freakonomics</a>" (2005). In his book "Visual Perception and Cultural Memory: Typecast and Typecast(e)ing in Malayalam Cinema", Sujith Kumar Parayil notes the similarities between Kalabhavan Mani's role in the film to the one Mani played in the <a href="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> film "<a href="Sallapam">Sallapam</a>" (1996).

For "Enthiran"'s soundtrack and score, A. R. Rahman made use of the <a href="Continuum%20Fingerboard">Continuum Fingerboard</a>, an instrument he had experimented with previously in the song "Rehna Tu" from <a href="Rakeysh%20Omprakash%20Mehra">Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra</a>'s <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama film</a> "<a href="Delhi-6">Delhi-6</a>" (2009). The film also marked the debut of Rahman's daughter Khatija as a playback singer.

The soundtrack album to "Enthiran" was released on 31 July 2010 at the <a href="Putrajaya%20International%20Convention%20Centre">Putrajaya International Convention Centre</a> in <a href="Kuala%20Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>, Malaysia.

The novelist Aarur Thamizhnadan made a complaint with the <a href="Chennai%20Metropolitan%20Police">Chennai Metropolitan Police</a> against the filmmakers in November 2010, stating that the producers plagiarised his 1996 novel "Jugiba". Thamizhnadan demanded 10 million from the director and producers for damages and filed a case against Kalanithi Maran. In June 2011, the <a href="Madras%20High%20Court">Madras High Court</a> dismissed the case after a petition filed by Maran denying the allegation was approved.

The daily newspaper "<a href="Business%20Line">Business Line</a>" reported that "Enthiran" grossed 580 million from all versions in the opening weekend, and "<a href="The%20Economic%20Times">The Economic Times</a>" stated it netted 1.17 billion by the end of its opening week. According to a February 2015 report by "Hindustan Times", the film has grossed ₹2.56 billion worldwide in its lifetime. <a href="Indo-Asian%20News%20Service">Indo-Asian News Service</a> stated in July 2015 that the film grossed ₹2.90 billion from both its original and dubbed versions. "Enthiran" became the top-earning Indian film of 2010 ahead of "<a href="My%20Name%20Is%20Khan">My Name Is Khan</a>" and "<a href="Dabangg">Dabangg</a>" and became the <a href="list%20of%20highest-grossing%20Tamil%20films">highest-grossing Tamil film of all time</a> at that point.

As of January 2018, "Enthiran" is the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films%23Highest-grossing%20Tamil%20films">fourth-highest-grossing</a> <a href="Cinema%20of%20South%20India">South Indian film</a> of all time after <a href="S.%20S.%20Rajamouli">S.

Ranjith</a>'s <a href="mob%20film">gangster drama</a> "<a href="Kabali%20%28film%29">Kabali</a>" (2016). <a href="Box%20Office%20India">Box Office India</a> estimated that "Enthiran" netted 1.95 billion across India with the Tamil version netting 1.20 billion, the Telugu version netting 530 million and the Hindi version netting 220 million.

"Enthiran" received positive reviews from critics in India, with praise particularly directed at Rathnavelu's cinematography, Cyril's art direction, Srinivas Mohan's visual effects and Rajinikanth's performance as Chitti. Aniruddha Guha of "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>" gave the film a rating of four out of five stars and believed it had the "best special effects ever seen in a Tamil film" and that it was "one of the most entertaining Tamil films—across all languages—ever made." Both <a href="Nikhat%20Kazmi">Nikhat Kazmi</a> of "The Times of India" and Kaveree Bamzai of "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>" rated the film four out of five stars. Kazmi called it "the perfect getaway film". Bamzai praised Rajinikanth's acting in the film and said, "Rajni tells us why robot sapiens are superior to <a href="homo%20sapiens">homo sapiens</a>".

Both <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> of <a href="NDTV">NDTV</a> and Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com gave "Enthiran" a rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five. Chopra criticised the film's portions in the second half, describing them as "needlessly stretched and cacophonous", but concluded her review by saying, ""Robot" rides on Rajinikanth's shoulders and he never stoops under the burden. Aided by snazzy clothes, make-up and special effects, he makes Chitti endearing." Srinivasan, however, said that Shankar "strikes the balance between science fiction and masala quotient." She concluded that, "Whichever way you look at it, is one of those rare films that give you just enough material to pull you in, and enjoy yourself." <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> of <a href="CNN-News18">CNN-News18</a> gave a rating of three out of five stars and said, "In the end, it's the fantastic special effects and an inspired performance from that keeps the film fresh." <a href="Mayank%20Shekhar">Mayank Shekhar</a>, writing for "Hindustan Times", rated it three stars and said, "Leave aside jokes running on the Internet. This film, just a few feet too long, is fine entertainment by itself."

Malini Mannath of "The New Indian Express" noted "Enthiran" for having "An engaging script, brilliant special effects, and a debonair hero who still carries his charisma effortlessly." Karthik Subramanian of "The Hindu" observed that actors "tend to get lost in special effects movies." Subramanian believed it was not the case in "Enthiran": "Rajinikanth and [Aishwarya Rai] carry the movie on their shoulders, and considering the fact that much of the acting must have been in front of green screens, one has to say that nothing looks artificial right through." In contrast, Gautaman Bhaskaran of "Hindustan Times" rated it two out of five stars, writing that "Shankar's work slips into a loud, overdramatic and exaggerated mess".

"Enthiran" has received a rating of 60% on the <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, based on ten reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. Lisa Tsering from "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" said, "Rajinikanth is such a badass that <a href="Chuck%20Norris">Chuck Norris</a> is <a href="Chuck%20Norris%20facts">afraid of him</a>." She praised the filming locations, especially the "Kilimanjaro" song sequence, but criticised the length of the film's climax portions. Genevieve Koski from "The A. V. Club" believed that "Enthiran" was "pretty good" and concluded that "if you prefer elaborate costumes and dance music mixed in with your killer-robot action, expect to enjoy up to an hour of "Enthiran"." Marc Savlov of "<a href="The%20Austin%20Chronicle">The Austin Chronicle</a>" called "Enthiran" "the best apocalyptic sci-fi-romcom-melodrama-dance-off date movie of the year." Roger Moore, writing for the "<a href="Orlando%20Sentinel">Orlando Sentinel</a>", gave a mixed review, evaluating it as a "melodramatic kitschy Indian musical about a robot built for national defense but who discovers his human side."

Following the film's screening at the <a href="Mumbai%20International%20Film%20Festival">Mumbai International Film Festival</a>, American film director <a href="Oliver%20Stone">Oliver Stone</a> praised "Enthiran" originality. Conversely, <a href="Joe%20Leydon">Joe Leydon</a> of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" believed that Shankar "riffs on everything" from "Frankenstein" to "The Terminator", but suggested that the film was an "overwhelming mash-up of American-style, f/x-driven sci-fi spectacle and a Bollywood musical." Akifumi Sugihara, director of the Film Business division of <a href="Nikkatsu">Nikkatsu</a>, stated that the film was "rather unique, interesting, funny and marketable." Miwako Fujioka, a member of the Japan-based Happinet Corporation, called "Enthiran" "a Bollywood "<a href="Transformers%20%28film%20series%29">Transformers</a>" type of film with a lot of Indian flavours in it."

At the <a href="58th%20National%20Film%20Awards">58th National Film Awards</a>, "Enthiran" won for <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Special%20Effects">Best Special Effects</a> and <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Production%20Design">Best Production Design</a>.

At the <a href="5th%20Vijay%20Awards">5th Vijay Awards</a>, it was nominated in fourteen categories and won in seven, including <a href="Vijay%20Award%20for%20Best%20Villain">Best Villain</a> and <a href="Vijay%20Award%20for%20Favourite%20Hero">Favourite Hero</a> for Rajinikanth, <a href="Vijay%20Award%20for%20Favourite%20Film">Favourite Film</a> and <a href="Vijay%20Award%20for%20Favourite%20Director">Favourite Director</a>. At the <a href="Screen%20Awards">17th Screen Awards</a>, the film won awards under the <a href="Screen%20Award%20for%20Best%20Special%20Effects">Best Special Effects</a> and Spectacular Cutting Edge Technology categories.

In a personal appreciation letter to Shankar following the film's release, the director <a href="K.%20Balachander">K. Balachander</a> described Shankar as India's <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a>, "Enthiran" as India's "<a href="Avatar%20%282009%20film%29">Avatar</a>" (2009) and Sun Pictures as India's <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>. "Enthiran" was the only Tamil film featured on the <a href="Internet%20Movie%20Database">Internet Movie Database</a> (IMDb) list of the 50 best films of 2010. The film was also included as a case study in a postgraduate elective course of the <a href="Indian%20Institute%20of%20Management%20Ahmedabad">Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad</a>, "Contemporary Film Industry: A Business Perspective".

Scenes from "Enthiran", particularly one known as the "Black Sheep" scene, have been parodied in subsequent films, including "<a href="Mankatha">Mankatha</a>" (2011), "<a href="Osthe">Osthe</a>" (2011), "<a href="Singam%20II">Singam II</a>" (2013), as well as in the Telugu films "<a href="Dookudu">Dookudu</a>" (2011) and "<a href="Nuvva%20Nena">Nuvva Nena</a>" (2011). In the film, Chitti often introduces himself by stating the <a href="clock%20rate">clock rate</a> of his <a href="central%20processing%20unit">central processing unit</a>, which is 1 terahertz (10 <a href="hertz">hertz</a>), and his <a href="random-access%20memory">random-access memory</a> limit, which is 1 zettabyte (10 <a href="byte">byte</a>s). This introduction dialogue, which is spoken by Chitti as "Hi, I'm Chitti, speed 1 terahertz, memory 1 zettabyte" became popular. Rajinikanth featured in a cameo role as Chitti in the science-fiction film "<a href="Ra.One">Ra.One</a>" (2011).

On Rajinikanth's 64th birthday, an agency named Minimal Kollywood Posters designed posters of Rajinikanth's films, in which the <a href="Despicable%20Me%20%28franchise%29%23Minions">Minion</a> characters from the "<a href="Despicable%20Me%20%28franchise%29">Despicable Me</a>" franchise are dressed as Rajinikanth. The digital art was hand drawn on a digital pad by Gautham Raj. One of the posters depicted a mutated Minion, reminiscent of Chitti's "villain robot" look in "Enthiran". In March 2015, Kamath, in his review of the science fiction film "<a href="Chappie%20%28film%29">Chappie</a>", compared its eponymous lead character to Chitti in terms of learning human emotions.

In September 2015, writer <a href="Jeyamohan">Jeyamohan</a> announced that the pre-production stage of a sequel to "Enthiran" was "going on in full swing" and that principal photography would commence once Rajinikanth finished filming for "Kabali", by the end of that year. <a href="Nirav%20Shah">Nirav Shah</a> would be the cinematographer and A. R. Rahman would return as music director, while Muthuraj would handle the art direction. The sequel would be shot in 3D, unlike its predecessor which was shot in 2D and converted to 3D in post-production. Titled "2.0", the film entered production in December 2015 and was released on 29 November 2018. Rajinikanth reprised his role as Vaseegaran and Chitti with the additional cast played by <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> and <a href="Amy%20Jackson">Amy Jackson</a>.
