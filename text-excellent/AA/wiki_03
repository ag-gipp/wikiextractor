Enzyme

Enzymes are <a href="macromolecular">macromolecular</a> <a href="biological">biological</a> <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>s. Enzymes accelerate <a href="chemical%20reactions">chemical reactions</a>. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called <a href="substrate%20%28chemistry%29">substrates</a> and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as <a href="product%20%28chemistry%29">products</a>. Almost all <a href="metabolism">metabolic processes</a> in the <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a> need <a href="enzyme%20catalysis">enzyme catalysis</a> in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. <a href="Metabolic%20pathway">Metabolic pathway</a>s depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps. The study of enzymes is called "enzymology" and a new field of <a href="pseudoenzyme">pseudoenzyme</a> analysis has recently grown up, recognising that during evolution, some enzymes have lost the ability to carry out biological catalysis, which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences and unusual 'pseudocatalytic' properties.

Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types. Most enzymes are <a href="protein">protein</a>s, although a few are <a href="Ribozyme">catalytic RNA molecules</a>. The latter are called ribozymes. Enzymes' <a href="Chemical%20specificity">specificity</a> comes from their unique <a href="tertiary%20structure">three-dimensional structures</a>.

Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the <a href="reaction%20rate">reaction rate</a> by lowering its <a href="activation%20energy">activation energy</a>. Some enzymes can make their conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is <a href="orotidine%205%27-phosphate%20decarboxylase">orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase</a>, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the <a href="Chemical%20equilibrium">equilibrium</a> of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: <a href="Enzyme%20inhibitor">inhibitors</a> are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and <a href="enzyme%20activator">activators</a> are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic <a href="drug">drug</a>s and <a href="poison">poison</a>s are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal <a href="temperature">temperature</a> and <a href="pH">pH</a>, and many enzymes are (permanently) <a href="Denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denatured</a> when exposed to excessive heat, losing their structure and catalytic properties.

Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of <a href="antibiotics">antibiotics</a>. Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions: enzymes in biological <a href="washing%20powder">washing powder</a>s break down protein, starch or <a href="fat">fat</a> stains on clothes, and enzymes in <a href="papain">meat tenderizer</a> break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.

By the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the digestion of <a href="meat">meat</a> by stomach secretions and the conversion of <a href="starch">starch</a> to <a href="sugar">sugar</a>s by plant extracts and <a href="saliva">saliva</a> were known but the mechanisms by which these occurred had not been identified.

French chemist <a href="Anselme%20Payen">Anselme Payen</a> was the first to discover an enzyme, <a href="diastase">diastase</a>, in 1833. A few decades later, when studying the <a href="fermentation%20%28food%29">fermentation</a> of sugar to <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a> by <a href="yeast">yeast</a>, <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> concluded that this fermentation was caused by a <a href="Vitalism">vital force</a> contained within the yeast cells called "ferments", which were thought to function only within living organisms. He wrote that "alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells, not with the death or putrefaction of the cells."

In 1877, German physiologist <a href="Wilhelm%20K%C3%BChne">Wilhelm Kühne</a> (1837–1900) first used the term "<a href="wiktionary%3Aenzyme">enzyme</a>", which comes from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> ἔνζυμον, "leavened" or "in yeast", to describe this process. The word "enzyme" was used later to refer to nonliving substances such as <a href="pepsin">pepsin</a>, and the word "ferment" was used to refer to chemical activity produced by living organisms.

<a href="Eduard%20Buchner">Eduard Buchner</a> submitted his first paper on the study of yeast extracts in 1897. In a series of experiments at the <a href="Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin">University of Berlin</a>, he found that sugar was fermented by yeast extracts even when there were no living yeast cells in the mixture. He named the enzyme that brought about the fermentation of sucrose "<a href="zymase">zymase</a>". In 1907, he received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> for "his discovery of cell-free fermentation". Following Buchner's example, enzymes are usually named according to the reaction they carry out: the suffix "<a href="-ase">-ase</a>" is combined with the name of the <a href="substrate%20%28biochemistry%29">substrate</a> (e.g., <a href="lactase">lactase</a> is the enzyme that cleaves <a href="lactose">lactose</a>) or to the type of reaction (e.g., <a href="DNA%20polymerase">DNA polymerase</a> forms DNA polymers).

The biochemical identity of enzymes was still unknown in the early 1900s. Many scientists observed that enzymatic activity was associated with proteins, but others (such as Nobel laureate <a href="Richard%20Willst%C3%A4tter">Richard Willstätter</a>) argued that proteins were merely carriers for the true enzymes and that proteins "per se" were incapable of catalysis. In 1926, <a href="James%20B.%20Sumner">James B. Sumner</a> showed that the enzyme <a href="urease">urease</a> was a pure protein and crystallized it; he did likewise for the enzyme <a href="catalase">catalase</a> in 1937. The conclusion that pure proteins can be enzymes was definitively demonstrated by <a href="John%20Howard%20Northrop">John Howard Northrop</a> and <a href="Wendell%20Meredith%20Stanley">Wendell Meredith Stanley</a>, who worked on the digestive enzymes <a href="pepsin">pepsin</a> (1930), <a href="trypsin">trypsin</a> and <a href="chymotrypsin">chymotrypsin</a>. These three scientists were awarded the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

The discovery that enzymes could be crystallized eventually allowed their structures to be solved by <a href="x-ray%20crystallography">x-ray crystallography</a>. This was first done for <a href="lysozyme">lysozyme</a>, an enzyme found in tears, saliva and <a href="egg%20white">egg white</a>s that digests the coating of some bacteria; the structure was solved by a group led by <a href="David%20Chilton%20Phillips">David Chilton Phillips</a> and published in 1965. This high-resolution structure of lysozyme marked the beginning of the field of <a href="structural%20biology">structural biology</a> and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail.

An enzyme's name is often derived from its substrate or the chemical reaction it catalyzes, with the word ending in "-ase". Examples are <a href="lactase">lactase</a>, <a href="alcohol%20dehydrogenase">alcohol dehydrogenase</a> and <a href="DNA%20polymerase">DNA polymerase</a>. Different enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction are called <a href="isozymes">isozymes</a>.

The <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Biochemistry%20and%20Molecular%20Biology">International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</a> have developed a <a href="nomenclature">nomenclature</a> for enzymes, the <a href="Enzyme%20Commission%20number">EC numbers</a>; each enzyme is described by a sequence of four numbers preceded by "EC", which stands for "Enzyme Commission". The first number broadly classifies the enzyme based on its mechanism.

The top-level classification is:

These sections are subdivided by other features such as the substrate, products, and <a href="chemical%20mechanism">chemical mechanism</a>. An enzyme is fully specified by four numerical designations. For example, <a href="hexokinase">hexokinase</a> (EC 2.7.1.1) is a transferase (EC 2) that adds a phosphate group (EC 2.7) to a hexose sugar, a molecule containing an alcohol group (EC 2.7.1).

Enzymes are generally <a href="globular%20protein">globular protein</a>s, acting alone or in larger <a href="protein%20complex">complexes</a>. The sequence of the amino acids specifies the structure which in turn determines the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Although structure determines function, a novel enzymatic activity cannot yet be predicted from structure alone. Enzyme structures unfold (<a href="denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denature</a>) when heated or exposed to chemical denaturants and this disruption to the structure typically causes a loss of activity. Enzyme denaturation is normally linked to temperatures above a species' normal level; as a result, enzymes from bacteria living in volcanic environments such as <a href="hot%20spring">hot spring</a>s are prized by industrial users for their ability to function at high temperatures, allowing enzyme-catalysed reactions to be operated at a very high rate.

Enzymes are usually much larger than their substrates. Sizes range from just 62 amino acid residues, for the <a href="monomer">monomer</a> of <a href="4-Oxalocrotonate%20tautomerase">4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase</a>, to over 2,500 residues in the animal <a href="fatty%20acid%20synthase">fatty acid synthase</a>. Only a small portion of their structure (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis: the catalytic site. This catalytic site is located next to one or more <a href="binding%20site">binding site</a>s where residues orient the substrates. The catalytic site and binding site together comprise the enzyme's <a href="active%20site">active site</a>. The remaining majority of the enzyme structure serves to maintain the precise orientation and dynamics of the active site.

In some enzymes, no amino acids are directly involved in catalysis; instead, the enzyme contains sites to bind and orient catalytic <a href="cofactor%20%28biochemistry%29">cofactors</a>. Enzyme structures may also contain <a href="allosteric%20site">allosteric site</a>s where the binding of a small molecule causes a <a href="conformational%20change">conformational change</a> that increases or decreases activity.

A small number of <a href="Ribonucleic%20acid">RNA</a>-based biological catalysts called <a href="ribozyme">ribozyme</a>s exist, which again can act alone or in complex with proteins. The most common of these is the <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a> which is a complex of protein and catalytic RNA components.

Enzymes must bind their substrates before they can catalyse any chemical reaction. Enzymes are usually very specific as to what <a href="substrate%20%28biochemistry%29">substrates</a> they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. <a href="Chemical%20specificity">Specificity</a> is achieved by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and <a href="hydrophilic">hydrophilic</a>/<a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be <a href="chemoselectivity">chemoselective</a>, <a href="regioselectivity">regioselective</a> and <a href="stereospecificity">stereospecific</a>.

Some of the enzymes showing the highest specificity and accuracy are involved in the copying and <a href="Gene%20expression">expression</a> of the <a href="genome">genome</a>. Some of these enzymes have "<a href="Proofreading%20%28biology%29">proof-reading</a>" mechanisms. Here, an enzyme such as <a href="DNA%20polymerase">DNA polymerase</a> catalyzes a reaction in a first step and then checks that the product is correct in a second step. This two-step process results in average error rates of less than 1 error in 100 million reactions in high-fidelity mammalian polymerases. Similar proofreading mechanisms are also found in <a href="RNA%20polymerase">RNA polymerase</a>, <a href="aminoacyl%20tRNA%20synthetase">aminoacyl tRNA synthetase</a>s and <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s.

Conversely, some enzymes display <a href="enzyme%20promiscuity">enzyme promiscuity</a>, having broad specificity and acting on a range of different physiologically relevant substrates. Many enzymes possess small side activities which arose fortuitously (i.e. <a href="Neutral%20evolution">neutrally</a>), which may be the starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.

To explain the observed specificity of enzymes, in 1894 <a href="Hermann%20Emil%20Fischer">Emil Fischer</a> proposed that both the enzyme and the substrate possess specific complementary geometric shapes that fit exactly into one another. This is often referred to as "the lock and key" model. This early model explains enzyme specificity, but fails to explain the stabilization of the transition state that enzymes achieve.

In 1958, <a href="Daniel%20E.%20Koshland%2C%20Jr.">Daniel Koshland</a> suggested a modification to the lock and key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate does not simply bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid <a href="Side%20chain">side-chains</a> that make up the active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as <a href="glycosidases">glycosidases</a>, the substrate <a href="molecule">molecule</a> also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.
Induced fit may enhance the fidelity of molecular recognition in the presence of competition and noise via the <a href="conformational%20proofreading">conformational proofreading</a> mechanism.

Enzymes can accelerate reactions in several ways, all of which lower the <a href="activation%20energy">activation energy</a> (ΔG, <a href="Gibbs%20free%20energy">Gibbs free energy</a>)
Enzymes may use several of these mechanisms simultaneously. For example, <a href="protease">protease</a>s such as <a href="trypsin">trypsin</a> perform covalent catalysis using a <a href="catalytic%20triad">catalytic triad</a>, stabilise charge build-up on the transition states using an <a href="oxyanion%20hole">oxyanion hole</a>, complete <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> using an oriented water substrate.

Enzymes are not rigid, static structures; instead they have complex internal dynamic motions – that is, movements of parts of the enzyme's structure such as individual amino acid residues, groups of residues forming a <a href="turn%20%28biochemistry%29">protein loop</a> or unit of <a href="protein%20secondary%20structure">secondary structure</a>, or even an entire <a href="protein%20domain">protein domain</a>. These motions give rise to a <a href="conformational%20ensemble">conformational ensemble</a> of slightly different structures that interconvert with one another at <a href="thermodynamic%20equilibrium">equilibrium</a>. Different states within this ensemble may be associated with different aspects of an enzyme's function. For example, different conformations of the enzyme <a href="dihydrofolate%20reductase">dihydrofolate reductase</a> are associated with the substrate binding, catalysis, cofactor release, and product release steps of the catalytic cycle.

Allosteric sites are pockets on the enzyme, distinct from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause a change in the conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause <a href="feedback">feedback</a> regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the <a href="Flux%20%28metabolism%29">flux</a> through the rest of the pathway.

Some enzymes do not need additional components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity. Cofactors can be either <a href="inorganic">inorganic</a> (e.g., <a href="ion">metal ions</a> and <a href="iron-sulfur%20cluster">iron-sulfur cluster</a>s) or <a href="organic%20molecules">organic compounds</a> (e.g., <a href="flavin%20group">flavin</a> and <a href="heme">heme</a>). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic cofactors can be either <a href="coenzyme">coenzyme</a>s, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or <a href="prosthetic%20groups">prosthetic groups</a>, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., <a href="biotin">biotin</a> in enzymes such as <a href="pyruvate%20carboxylase">pyruvate carboxylase</a>).

An example of an enzyme that contains a cofactor is <a href="carbonic%20anhydrase">carbonic anhydrase</a>, which is shown in the <a href="ribbon%20diagram">ribbon diagram</a> above with a zinc cofactor bound as part of its active site. These tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis. For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in <a href="redox">redox</a> reactions.

Enzymes that require a cofactor but do not have one bound are called "apoenzymes" or "apoproteins". An enzyme together with the cofactor(s) required for activity is called a "holoenzyme" (or haloenzyme). The term "holoenzyme" can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the <a href="DNA%20polymerase">DNA polymerase</a>s; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.

Coenzymes are small organic molecules that can be loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include <a href="Nicotinamide%20adenine%20dinucleotide">NADH</a>, <a href="Nicotinamide%20adenine%20dinucleotide%20phosphate">NADPH</a> and <a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate</a> (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as <a href="flavin%20mononucleotide">flavin mononucleotide</a> (FMN), <a href="flavin%20adenine%20dinucleotide">flavin adenine dinucleotide</a> (FAD), <a href="thiamine%20pyrophosphate">thiamine pyrophosphate</a> (TPP), and <a href="tetrahydrofolate">tetrahydrofolate</a> (THF), are derived from <a href="vitamin">vitamin</a>s. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body "<a href="De%20novo%20synthesis">de novo</a>" and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include: 
Since coenzymes are chemically changed as a consequence of enzyme action, it is useful to consider coenzymes to be a special class of substrates, or second substrates, which are common to many different enzymes. For example, about 1000 enzymes are known to use the coenzyme NADH.

Coenzymes are usually continuously regenerated and their concentrations maintained at a steady level inside the cell. For example, NADPH is regenerated through the <a href="pentose%20phosphate%20pathway">pentose phosphate pathway</a> and "S"-adenosylmethionine by <a href="methionine%20adenosyltransferase">methionine adenosyltransferase</a>. This continuous regeneration means that small amounts of coenzymes can be used very intensively. For example, the human body turns over its own weight in ATP each day.

As with all catalysts, enzymes do not alter the position of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction. In the presence of an enzyme, the reaction runs in the same direction as it would without the enzyme, just more quickly. For example, <a href="carbonic%20anhydrase">carbonic anhydrase</a> catalyzes its reaction in either direction depending on the concentration of its reactants:

The rate of a reaction is dependent on the <a href="activation%20energy">activation energy</a> needed to form the <a href="transition%20state">transition state</a> which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Secondly the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products.

Enzymes can couple two or more reactions, so that a thermodynamically favorable reaction can be used to "drive" a thermodynamically unfavourable one so that the combined energy of the products is lower than the substrates. For example, the hydrolysis of <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a> is often used to drive other chemical reactions.

Enzyme kinetics is the investigation of how enzymes bind substrates and turn them into products. The rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from <a href="enzyme%20assay">enzyme assay</a>s. In 1913 <a href="Leonor%20Michaelis">Leonor Michaelis</a> and <a href="Maud%20Leonora%20Menten">Maud Leonora Menten</a> proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, which is referred to as <a href="Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten%20kinetics">Michaelis–Menten kinetics</a>. The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis-Menten complex in their honor. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. This work was further developed by <a href="George%20Edward%20Briggs">G. E. Briggs</a> and <a href="J.%20B.%20S.%20Haldane">J. B. S. Haldane</a>, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.

Enzyme rates depend on <a href="solution">solution</a> conditions and substrate <a href="concentration">concentration</a>. To find the maximum speed of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This is shown in the saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, more and more of the free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate ("V") of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex is the same as the total amount of enzyme.

"V" is only one of several important kinetic parameters. The amount of substrate needed to achieve a given rate of reaction is also important. This is given by the <a href="Michaelis-Menten%20constant">Michaelis-Menten constant</a> ("K"), which is the substrate concentration required for an enzyme to reach one-half its maximum reaction rate; generally, each enzyme has a characteristic "K" for a given substrate. Another useful constant is "k", also called the "turnover number", which is the number of substrate molecules handled by one active site per second.

The efficiency of an enzyme can be expressed in terms of "k"/"K". This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the <a href="rate%20constant">rate constant</a>s for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 10 to 10 (M s). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called "<a href="catalytically%20perfect%20enzyme">catalytically perfect</a>" or "kinetically perfect". Example of such enzymes are <a href="triosephosphateisomerase">triose-phosphate isomerase</a>, <a href="carbonic%20anhydrase">carbonic anhydrase</a>, <a href="acetylcholinesterase">acetylcholinesterase</a>, <a href="catalase">catalase</a>, <a href="fumarase">fumarase</a>, <a href="%CE%B2-lactamase">β-lactamase</a>, and <a href="superoxide%20dismutase">superoxide dismutase</a>. The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second. But most enzymes are far from perfect: the average values of formula_1 and formula_2 are about formula_3 and formula_4, respectively.

Michaelis–Menten kinetics relies on the <a href="law%20of%20mass%20action">law of mass action</a>, which is derived from the assumptions of free <a href="diffusion">diffusion</a> and thermodynamically driven random collision. Many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of <a href="macromolecular%20crowding">macromolecular crowding</a> and constrained molecular movement. More recent, complex extensions of the model attempt to correct for these effects.

Enzyme reaction rates can be decreased by various types of <a href="enzyme%20inhibitor">enzyme inhibitor</a>s.

A <a href="competitive%20inhibitor">competitive inhibitor</a> and substrate cannot bind to the enzyme at the same time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug <a href="methotrexate">methotrexate</a> is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme <a href="dihydrofolate%20reductase">dihydrofolate reductase</a>, which catalyzes the reduction of <a href="folic%20acid">dihydrofolate</a> to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an <a href="%23Allosteric%20modulation">allosteric effect</a> to change the shape of the usual binding-site.

A <a href="non-competitive%20inhibition">non-competitive inhibitor</a> binds to a site other than where the substrate binds. The substrate still binds with its usual affinity and hence K remains the same. However the inhibitor reduces the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme so that V is reduced. In contrast to competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition cannot be overcome with high substrate concentration.

An <a href="uncompetitive%20inhibitor">uncompetitive inhibitor</a> cannot bind to the free enzyme, only to the enzyme-substrate complex; hence, these types of inhibitors are most effective at high substrate concentration. In the presence of the inhibitor, the enzyme-substrate complex is inactive. This type of inhibition is rare.

A <a href="mixed%20inhibition">mixed inhibitor</a> binds to an allosteric site and the binding of the substrate and the inhibitor affect each other. The enzyme's function is reduced but not eliminated when bound to the inhibitor. This type of inhibitor does not follow the Michaelis-Menten equation.

An <a href="irreversible%20inhibitor">irreversible inhibitor</a> permanently inactivates the enzyme, usually by forming a <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent bond</a> to the protein. <a href="Penicillin">Penicillin</a> and <a href="aspirin">aspirin</a> are common drugs that act in this manner.

In many organisms, inhibitors may act as part of a <a href="feedback">feedback</a> mechanism. If an enzyme produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may act as an inhibitor for the enzyme at the beginning of the pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow down or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of <a href="negative%20feedback">negative feedback</a>. Major metabolic pathways such as the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a> make use of this mechanism.

Since inhibitors modulate the function of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme's native substrate, similar to <a href="methotrexate">methotrexate</a> above; other well-known examples include <a href="statin">statin</a>s used to treat high <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>, and <a href="protease%20inhibitor%20%28pharmacology%29">protease inhibitors</a> used to treat <a href="retrovirus">retroviral</a> infections such as <a href="HIV">HIV</a>. A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that is used as a drug is <a href="aspirin">aspirin</a>, which inhibits the <a href="Cyclooxygenase">COX-1</a> and <a href="Cyclooxygenase">COX-2</a> enzymes that produce the <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> messenger <a href="prostaglandin">prostaglandin</a>. Other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a> is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme <a href="cytochrome%20c%20oxidase">cytochrome c oxidase</a> and blocks <a href="cellular%20respiration">cellular respiration</a>.

Enzymes serve a wide variety of <a href="function%20%28biology%29">functions</a> inside living organisms. They are indispensable for <a href="signal%20transduction">signal transduction</a> and cell regulation, often via <a href="kinase">kinase</a>s and <a href="phosphatase">phosphatase</a>s. They also generate movement, with <a href="myosin">myosin</a> hydrolyzing ATP to generate <a href="muscle%20contraction">muscle contraction</a>, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the <a href="cytoskeleton">cytoskeleton</a>. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are <a href="ion%20pump%20%28biology%29">ion pumps</a> involved in <a href="active%20transport">active transport</a>. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as <a href="luciferase">luciferase</a> generating light in <a href="firefly">fireflies</a>. <a href="Virus">Virus</a>es can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the <a href="HIV%20integrase">HIV integrase</a> and <a href="reverse%20transcriptase">reverse transcriptase</a>, or for viral release from cells, like the <a href="influenza">influenza</a> virus <a href="neuraminidase">neuraminidase</a>.

An important function of enzymes is in the <a href="digestive%20systems">digestive systems</a> of animals. Enzymes such as <a href="amylase">amylase</a>s and <a href="protease">protease</a>s break down large molecules (<a href="starch">starch</a> or <a href="protein">protein</a>s, respectively) into smaller ones, so they can be absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as <a href="maltose">maltose</a> and eventually <a href="glucose">glucose</a>, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a>s, which have <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a> diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, <a href="cellulase">cellulase</a>, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.

Several enzymes can work together in a specific order, creating <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a>s. In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.

Enzymes determine what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither progress through the same steps and could not be regulated to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a>. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are <a href="endothermic">thermodynamically unfavorable</a> can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.

There are five main ways that enzyme activity is controlled in the cell.

Enzymes can be either <a href="enzyme%20activator">activated</a> or <a href="enzyme%20inhibitor">inhibited</a> by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors for one of the first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a <a href="negative%20feedback">negative feedback mechanism</a>, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according to the demands of the cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other <a href="homeostasis">homeostatic devices</a>, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.

Examples of <a href="post-translational%20modification">post-translational modification</a> include <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a>, <a href="myristoylation">myristoylation</a> and <a href="glycosylation">glycosylation</a>. For example, in the response to <a href="insulin">insulin</a>, the <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> of multiple enzymes, including <a href="glycogen%20synthase">glycogen synthase</a>, helps control the synthesis or degradation of <a href="glycogen">glycogen</a> and allows the cell to respond to changes in <a href="blood%20sugar">blood sugar</a>. Another example of post-translational modification is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. <a href="Chymotrypsin">Chymotrypsin</a>, a digestive <a href="protease">protease</a>, is produced in inactive form as <a href="chymotrypsinogen">chymotrypsinogen</a> in the <a href="pancreas">pancreas</a> and transported in this form to the <a href="stomach">stomach</a> where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme is known as a <a href="zymogen">zymogen</a> or proenzyme.

Enzyme production (<a href="Transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a> and <a href="Translation%20%28genetics%29">translation</a> of enzyme genes) can be enhanced or diminished by a cell in response to changes in the cell's environment. This form of <a href="regulation%20of%20gene%20expression">gene regulation</a> is called <a href="enzyme%20induction">enzyme induction</a>. For example, bacteria may become <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">resistant to antibiotics</a> such as <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> because enzymes called <a href="beta-lactamase">beta-lactamase</a>s are induced that hydrolyse the crucial <a href="Beta-lactam">beta-lactam ring</a> within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the <a href="liver">liver</a> called <a href="cytochrome%20P450%20oxidase">cytochrome P450 oxidase</a>s, which are important in <a href="drug%20metabolism">drug metabolism</a>. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause <a href="drug%20interaction">drug interaction</a>s. Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme <a href="catabolism">degradation</a>. The opposite of enzyme induction is <a href="enzyme%20repression">enzyme repression</a>.

Enzymes can be compartmentalized, with different metabolic pathways occurring in different <a href="cellular%20compartment">cellular compartment</a>s. For example, <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s are synthesized by one set of enzymes in the <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a>, <a href="endoplasmic%20reticulum">endoplasmic reticulum</a> and <a href="golgi%20apparatus">Golgi</a> and used by a different set of enzymes as a source of energy in the <a href="mitochondrion">mitochondrion</a>, through <a href="%CE%B2-oxidation">β-oxidation</a>. In addition, <a href="protein%20targeting">trafficking</a> of the enzyme to different compartments may change the degree of <a href="protonation">protonation</a> (e.g., the neutral <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> and the acidic <a href="lysosome">lysosome</a>) or oxidative state (e.g., oxidizing <a href="periplasm">periplasm</a> or reducing <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a>) which in turn affects enzyme activity. In contrast to partitioning into membrane bound organelles, enzyme subcellular localisation may also be altered through polymerisation of enzymes into macromolecular cytoplasmic filaments.

In <a href="multicellular">multicellular</a> <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s, cells in different <a href="organ%20%28anatomy%29">organs</a> and <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a> have different patterns of <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a> and therefore have different sets of enzymes (known as <a href="isozyme">isozyme</a>s) available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, <a href="hexokinase">hexokinase</a>, the first enzyme in the <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a> pathway, has a specialized form called <a href="glucokinase">glucokinase</a> expressed in the <a href="liver">liver</a> and <a href="pancreas">pancreas</a> that has a lower <a href="affinity%20%28pharmacology%29">affinity</a> for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing <a href="blood%20sugar">blood sugar</a> and regulating <a href="insulin">insulin</a> production.

Since the tight control of enzyme activity is essential for <a href="homeostasis">homeostasis</a>, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme can lead to a <a href="genetic%20disease">genetic disease</a>. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal <a href="genetic%20disease">genetic disease</a> due to enzyme insufficiency is <a href="Tay%E2%80%93Sachs%20disease">Tay–Sachs disease</a>, in which patients lack the enzyme <a href="hexosaminidase">hexosaminidase</a>.

One example of enzyme deficiency is the most common type of <a href="phenylketonuria">phenylketonuria</a>. Many different single amino acid mutations in the enzyme <a href="phenylalanine%20hydroxylase">phenylalanine hydroxylase</a>, which catalyzes the first step in the degradation of <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>, result in build-up of phenylalanine and related products. Some mutations are in the active site, directly disrupting binding and catalysis, but many are far from the active site and reduce activity by destabilising the protein structure, or affecting correct oligomerisation. This can lead to <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> if the disease is untreated. Another example is <a href="pseudocholinesterase%20deficiency">pseudocholinesterase deficiency</a>, in which the body's ability to break down choline ester drugs is impaired. 
Oral administration of enzymes can be used to treat some functional enzyme deficiencies, such as <a href="pancreatic%20insufficiency">pancreatic insufficiency</a> and <a href="lactose%20intolerance">lactose intolerance</a>.

Another way enzyme malfunctions can cause disease comes from <a href="germline%20mutation">germline mutation</a>s in genes coding for <a href="DNA%20repair">DNA repair</a> enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are less able to repair mutations in their <a href="genome">genome</a>s. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results in the <a href="carcinogenesis">development of cancers</a>. An example of such a hereditary <a href="cancer%20syndrome">cancer syndrome</a> is <a href="xeroderma%20pigmentosum">xeroderma pigmentosum</a>, which causes the development of <a href="skin%20cancer">skin cancer</a>s in response to even minimal exposure to <a href="ultraviolet%20light">ultraviolet light</a>.

Enzymes are used in the <a href="chemical%20industry">chemical industry</a> and other industrial applications when extremely specific catalysts are required. Enzymes in general are limited in the number of reactions they have evolved to catalyze and also by their lack of stability in <a href="organic%20solvent">organic solvent</a>s and at high temperatures. As a consequence, <a href="protein%20engineering">protein engineering</a> is an active area of research and involves attempts to create new enzymes with novel properties, either through rational design or "in vitro" evolution. These efforts have begun to be successful, and a few enzymes have now been designed "from scratch" to catalyze reactions that do not occur in nature.

Elephant

Elephants are large mammals of the family <a href="Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a> in the order <a href="Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a>. Three species are currently recognised: the <a href="African%20bush%20elephant">African bush elephant</a> ("Loxodonta africana"), the <a href="African%20forest%20elephant">African forest elephant</a> ("L. cyclotis"), and the <a href="Asian%20elephant">Asian elephant</a> ("Elephas maximus"). Elephants are scattered throughout <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>, and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include <a href="Deinotheriidae">deinotheres</a>, <a href="gomphothere">gomphothere</a>s, <a href="Mammutidae">mastodon</a>s, <a href="Anancidae">anancids</a> and <a href="Stegodontidae">stegodontids</a>; Elephantidae itself also contains several now extinct groups, such as the <a href="mammoth">mammoth</a>s and <a href="Palaeoloxodon">straight-tusked elephants</a>.

All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk (also called a <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a>), used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their <a href="column">pillar</a>-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.

Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including <a href="savanna">savanna</a>hs, forests, deserts, and <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be a <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a> due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants while predators, such as <a href="lion">lion</a>s, <a href="tiger">tiger</a>s, <a href="hyena">hyena</a>s, and any <a href="Canidae">wild dogs</a>, usually target only young elephants (or "calves"). Elephants have a <a href="fission%E2%80%93fusion%20society">fission–fusion society</a> in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females ("cows") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the <a href="Matriarchy">matriarch</a>, often the oldest cow.

Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a> and aggression known as <a href="musth">musth</a>, which helps them gain <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">dominance</a> and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use <a href="infrasound">infrasound</a>, and <a href="seismic%20communication">seismic communication</a> over long distances. <a href="Elephant%20cognition">Elephant intelligence</a> has been compared with that of <a href="primate">primate</a>s and <a href="cetacea">cetacea</a>ns. They appear to have <a href="self-awareness">self-awareness</a> and show <a href="empathy">empathy</a> for dying or dead individuals of their kind.

African elephants are listed as <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a>. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the <a href="ivory%20trade">ivory trade</a>, as the animals are <a href="Poaching">poached</a> for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as <a href="working%20animal">working animal</a>s in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in <a href="circus">circus</a>es. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>.

The word "elephant" is based on the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "elephas" (<a href="genitive">genitive</a> "elephantis") ("elephant"), which is the <a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinised</a> form of the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ἐλέφας ("elephas") (genitive ἐλέφαντος ("elephantos")), probably from a non-<a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> language, likely <a href="Phoenician%20language">Phoenician</a>. It is attested in <a href="Mycenaean%20Greek">Mycenaean Greek</a> as "e-re-pa" (genitive "e-re-pa-to") in <a href="Linear%20B">Linear B</a> syllabic script. As in Mycenaean Greek, <a href="Homer">Homer</a> used the Greek word to mean <a href="ivory">ivory</a>, but after the time of <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, it also referred to the animal. The word "elephant" appears in <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> as "olyfaunt" (c.1300) and was borrowed from <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "oliphant" (12th century). "<a href="African%20elephant">Loxodonta</a>", the generic name for the African elephants, is Greek for "oblique-sided tooth".

Elephants belong to the family <a href="Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a>, the sole remaining family within the order <a href="Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a> which belongs to the superorder <a href="Afrotheria">Afrotheria</a>. Their closest <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> relatives are the <a href="sirenia">sirenia</a>ns (<a href="dugong">dugong</a>s and <a href="manatee">manatee</a>s) and the <a href="hyrax">hyrax</a>es, with which they share the <a href="clade">clade</a> <a href="Paenungulata">Paenungulata</a> within the superorder <a href="Afrotheria">Afrotheria</a>. Elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the clade <a href="Tethytheria">Tethytheria</a>. Three species of elephants are recognised; the <a href="African%20bush%20elephant">African bush elephant</a> ("Loxodonta africana") and <a href="African%20forest%20elephant">forest elephant</a> ("Loxodonta cyclotis") of <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, and the <a href="Asian%20elephant">Asian elephant</a> ("<a href="Elephas">Elephas</a> maximus") of <a href="South%20Asia">South</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. African elephants have larger ears, a concave back, more wrinkled skin, a sloping abdomen, and two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk. Asian elephants have smaller ears, a convex or level back, smoother skin, a horizontal abdomen that occasionally sags in the middle and one extension at the tip of the trunk. The looped ridges on the <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> are narrower in the Asian elephant while those of the African are more diamond-shaped. The Asian elephant also has <a href="wikt%3Adorsal">dorsal</a> bumps on its head and some patches of <a href="Biological%20pigment">depigmentation</a> on its skin.

Swedish zoologist <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> first <a href="Species%20description">described</a> the genus "Elephas" and an elephant from <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> (then known as Ceylon) under the <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> "Elephas maximus" in 1758. In 1798, <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> classified the <a href="Indian%20elephant">Indian elephant</a> under the binomial "Elephas indicus". Dutch zoologist <a href="Coenraad%20Jacob%20Temminck">Coenraad Jacob Temminck</a> described the <a href="Sumatran%20elephant">Sumatran elephant</a> in 1847 under the binomial "Elephas sumatranus". English zoologist <a href="Frederick%20Nutter%20Chasen">Frederick Nutter Chasen</a> classified all three as <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the Asian elephant in 1940. Asian elephants vary geographically in their colour and amount of depigmentation. The <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20elephant">Sri Lankan elephant</a> ("Elephas maximus maximus") inhabits Sri Lanka, the Indian elephant ("E. m. indicus") is native to mainland Asia (on the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> and <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a>), and the Sumatran elephant ("E. m. sumatranus") is found in Sumatra. One disputed subspecies, the <a href="Borneo%20elephant">Borneo elephant</a>, lives in northern <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> and is smaller than all the other subspecies. It has larger ears, a longer tail, and straighter tusks than the typical elephant. Sri Lankan zoologist <a href="Paules%20Edward%20Pieris%20Deraniyagala">Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala</a> described it in 1950 under the <a href="Trinomial%20nomenclature">trinomial</a> "Elephas maximus borneensis", taking as his <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type</a> an illustration in "<a href="National%20Geographic%20%28magazine%29">National Geographic</a>". It was subsequently subsumed under either "E. m. indicus" or "E. m. sumatranus". Results of a 2003 <a href="genetic%20analysis">genetic analysis</a> indicate its ancestors <a href="Genetic%20divergence">separated</a> from the mainland population about 300,000 years ago. A 2008 study found that Borneo elephants are not indigenous to the island but were brought there before 1521 by the <a href="List%20of%20sultans%20of%20Sulu">Sultan of Sulu</a> from <a href="Java">Java</a>, where elephants are now extinct.

The <a href="African%20elephant">African elephant</a> was first named by German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Blumenbach">Johann Friedrich Blumenbach</a> in 1797 as "Elephas africanus". The genus "Loxodonta" was named by <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Cuvier">Frédéric Cuvier</a> in 1825. Cuvier spelled it "Loxodonte," but in 1827 an anonymous author <a href="Romanization">romanised</a> the spelling to "Loxodonta"; the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</a> recognises this as the proper authority. In 1942, 18 subspecies of African elephant were recognised by <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a>, but further morphological data has reduced the number of classified subspecies, and by the 1990s, only two were recognised, the savannah or bush elephant ("L. a. africana") and the forest elephant ("L. a. cyclotis"), the latter having been named in 1900 by German zoologist <a href="Paul%20Matschie">Paul Matschie</a>. Forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush elephants, and are limited in range to the forested areas of <a href="West%20Africa">western</a> and <a href="Central%20Africa">Central Africa</a>. A 2000 study argued for the elevation of the two forms into separate species ("L. africana" and "L. cyclotis" respectively) based on differences in skull morphology. DNA studies published in 2001 and 2007 also suggested they were distinct species while studies in 2002 and 2005 concluded that they were the same species. Further studies (2010, 2011, 2015) have supported African savannah and forest elephants' status as separate species. The two species are believed to have diverged 6 million years ago and have been completely genetically isolated for the past 500,000 years. In 2017, DNA sequence analysis showed that "L. cyclotis" is more closely related to the extinct "<a href="Palaeoloxodon%20antiquus">Palaeoloxodon antiquus</a>", than it is to "L. africana," possibly undermining the genus Loxodonta as a whole. Some evidence suggests that elephants of western Africa are a separate species, although this is disputed. The <a href="pygmy%20elephant">pygmy elephant</a>s of the <a href="Congo%20Basin">Congo Basin</a>, which have been suggested to be a separate species ("Loxodonta pumilio") are probably forest elephants whose small size and/or early maturity are due to environmental conditions.

Over 185 extinct members and three major <a href="Adaptive%20radiation">evolutionary radiations</a> of the order Proboscidea have been recorded. The earliest proboscids, the African "<a href="Eritherium">Eritherium</a>" and "<a href="Phosphatherium">Phosphatherium</a>" of the late <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a>, heralded the first radiation. The <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> included "<a href="Numidotherium">Numidotherium</a>", "<a href="Moeritherium">Moeritherium</a>," and "<a href="Barytherium">Barytherium</a>" from Africa. These animals were relatively small and aquatic. Later on, genera such as "<a href="Phiomia">Phiomia</a>" and "<a href="Palaeomastodon">Palaeomastodon</a>" arose; the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands. Proboscidean diversity declined during the Oligocene. One notable species of this epoch was "<a href="Eritreum">Eritreum</a> melakeghebrekristosi" of the <a href="Horn%20of%20Africa">Horn of Africa</a>, which may have been an ancestor to several later species. The beginning of the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> saw the second diversification, with the appearance of the <a href="Deinotheriidae">deinotheres</a> and the <a href="Mammutidae">mammutids</a>. The former were related to "Barytherium" and lived in Africa and Eurasia, while the latter may have descended from "Eritreum" and spread to North America.

The second radiation was represented by the emergence of the <a href="gomphothere">gomphothere</a>s in the Miocene, which likely evolved from "Eritreum" and originated in Africa, spreading to every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Members of this group included "<a href="Gomphotherium">Gomphotherium</a>" and "<a href="Platybelodon">Platybelodon</a>". The third radiation started in the late Miocene and led to the arrival of the elephantids, which descended from, and slowly replaced, the gomphotheres. The African "<a href="Primelephas">Primelephas</a> gomphotheroides" gave rise to "Loxodonta", "Mammuthus," and "Elephas". "Loxodonta" branched off earliest around the Miocene and <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> boundary while "Mammuthus" and "Elephas" diverged later during the early Pliocene. "Loxodonta" remained in Africa while "Mammuthus" and "Elephas" spread to Eurasia, and the former reached North America. At the same time, the <a href="Stegodontidae">stegodontids</a>, another proboscidean group descended from gomphotheres, spread throughout Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, China, southeast Asia, and Japan. Mammutids continued to evolve into new species, such as the <a href="Mastodon">American mastodon</a>.

At the beginning of the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, elephantids experienced a high rate of <a href="speciation">speciation</a>. The Pleistocene also saw the arrival of "<a href="Palaeoloxodon%20namadicus">Palaeoloxodon namadicus</a>", the largest terrestrial mammal of all time. "<a href="Loxodonta%20atlantica">Loxodonta atlantica</a>" became the most common species in northern and southern Africa but was replaced by "Elephas iolensis" later in the Pleistocene. Only when "Elephas" disappeared from Africa did "Loxodonta" become dominant once again, this time in the form of the modern species. "Elephas" diversified into new species in Asia, such as "E. hysudricus" and "E. platycephus"; the latter the likely ancestor of the modern Asian elephant. "Mammuthus" evolved into several species, including the well-known <a href="woolly%20mammoth">woolly mammoth</a>. Interbreeding appears to have been common among elephantid species, which in some cases led to species with three ancestral genetic components, such as the straight-tusked elephants. In the <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a>, most proboscidean species vanished during the <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">Quaternary glaciation</a> which <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">killed off</a> 50% of genera weighing over worldwide.

Proboscideans experienced several evolutionary trends, such as an increase in size, which led to many giant species that stood up to tall. As with other <a href="megaherbivore">megaherbivore</a>s, including the extinct <a href="Sauropoda">sauropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s, the large size of elephants likely developed to allow them to survive on vegetation with low nutritional value. Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader. The feet were originally <a href="plantigrade">plantigrade</a> and developed into a <a href="digitigrade">digitigrade</a> stance with cushion pads and the <a href="sesamoid%20bone">sesamoid bone</a> providing support. Early proboscideans developed longer <a href="mandible">mandible</a>s and smaller <a href="Skull">craniums</a> while more <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> ones developed shorter mandibles, which shifted the head's <a href="Center%20of%20mass">centre of gravity</a>. The skull grew larger, especially the cranium, while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull. The increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach. The number of <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s, incisors and <a href="canine%20tooth">canines</a> decreased. The cheek teeth (molars and premolars) became larger and more specialized, especially after elephants started to switch from <a href="C3%20carbon%20fixation">C3-plants</a> to <a href="C4%20carbon%20fixation">C4-grasses</a>, which caused their teeth to undergo a three-fold increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago. Only in the last million years or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of C3 trees and shrubs. The upper second incisors grew into tusks, which varied in shape from straight, to curved (either upward or downward), to spiralled, depending on the species. Some proboscideans developed tusks from their lower incisors. Elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry, such as their <a href="middle%20ear">middle ear</a> anatomy.

There has been some debate over the relationship of "Mammuthus" to "Loxodonta" or "Elephas". Some <a href="DNA">DNA</a> studies suggest "Mammuthus" is more closely related to the former while others point to the latter. However, analysis of the complete <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial genome</a> profile of the woolly mammoth (sequenced in 2005) supports "Mammuthus" being more closely related to "Elephas". <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">Morphological</a> evidence supports "Mammuthus" and "Elephas" as <a href="Sister%20group">sister taxa</a> while comparisons of <a href="Serum%20albumin">protein albumin</a> and <a href="collagen">collagen</a> have concluded that all three genera are equally related to each other. Some scientists believe a <a href="cloning">cloned</a> mammoth <a href="embryo">embryo</a> could one day be implanted in an Asian elephant's womb.

Several species of proboscideans lived on islands and experienced <a href="insular%20dwarfism">insular dwarfism</a>. This occurred primarily during the Pleistocene when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels, although dwarf elephants did exist earlier in the Pliocene. These elephants likely grew smaller on islands due to a lack of large or viable predator populations and limited resources. By contrast, small mammals such as rodents develop <a href="Island%20gigantism">gigantism</a> in these conditions. Dwarf proboscideans are known to have lived in <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, the <a href="Channel%20Islands%20of%20California">Channel Islands of California</a>, and several islands of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>.

"<a href="Elephas%20celebensis">Elephas celebensis</a>" of <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a> is believed to have descended from "<a href="Elephas%20planifrons">Elephas planifrons</a>". "<a href="Palaeoloxodon%20falconeri">Elephas falconeri</a>" of <a href="Malta">Malta</a> and <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> was only and had probably evolved from the <a href="straight-tusked%20elephant">straight-tusked elephant</a>. Other descendants of the straight-tusked elephant existed in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. Dwarf elephants of uncertain descent lived in <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, <a href="Cyclades">Cyclades</a>, and <a href="Dodecanese">Dodecanese</a> while dwarf mammoths are known to have lived in <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>. The <a href="Columbian%20mammoth">Columbian mammoth</a> colonised the <a href="Channel%20Islands%20of%20California">Channel Islands</a> and evolved into the <a href="pygmy%20mammoth">pygmy mammoth</a>. This species reached a height of and weighed . A population of small woolly mammoths survived on <a href="Wrangel%20Island">Wrangel Island</a>, now north of the Siberian coast, as recently as 4,000 years ago. After their discovery in 1993, they were considered dwarf mammoths. This classification has been re-evaluated and since the Second International Mammoth Conference in 1999, these animals are no longer considered to be true "dwarf mammoths".

Elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. African bush elephants are the largest species, with males typically being tall at the shoulder and while females stand tall at the shoulder with a body mass of . Male Asian elephants are usually about tall at the shoulder and whereas females are tall at the shoulder and . African forest elephants are the smallest species, usually being around tall at the shoulder and . Male African elephants are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male Asian elephants are only around 15% taller than females. The skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326–351 bones. The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.

An elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (<a href="Sinus%20%28anatomy%29">sinuses</a>) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a <a href="honeycomb">honeycomb</a>-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a <a href="lacrimal%20apparatus">lacrimal apparatus</a>, the eye relies on the <a href="harderian%20gland">harderian gland</a> to keep it moist. A durable <a href="nictitating%20membrane">nictitating membrane</a> protects the eye globe. The animal's <a href="Field%20of%20view">field of vision</a> is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered <a href="Dichromacy">dichromats</a> and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.

Elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips. The ear flaps, or <a href="pinna%20%28anatomy%29">pinnae</a>, contain numerous blood vessels called <a href="capillary">capillaries</a>. Warm blood flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 <a href="Hertz">kHz</a> (in close proximity to the <a href="Soprano">Soprano</a> <a href="C%20%28musical%20note%29">C</a>).

The trunk, or <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a>, is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early <a href="Fetus">fetal</a> life, the upper lip and trunk are separated. The trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant's most important and versatile appendage. It contains up to 150,000 separate <a href="muscle%20fascicle">muscle fascicle</a>s, with no bone and little fat. These paired muscles consist of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal. The former are divided into <a href="Dorsoventral">dorsals, ventrals</a>, and <a href="Lateral%20and%20medial">laterals</a> while the latter are divided into <a href="Transverse%20plane">transverse</a> and <a href="wikt%3Aradiate">radiating</a> muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull. The <a href="nasal%20septum">nasal septum</a> is composed of tiny muscle units that stretch horizontally between the nostrils. <a href="Cartilage">Cartilage</a> divides the nostrils at the base. As a <a href="muscular%20hydrostat">muscular hydrostat</a>, the trunk moves by precisely coordinated muscle contractions. The muscles work both with and against each other. A unique proboscis nerve – formed by the <a href="maxillary%20nerve">maxillary</a> and <a href="facial%20nerve">facial nerve</a>s – runs along both sides of the trunk.

Elephant trunks have multiple functions, including breathing, <a href="olfaction">olfaction</a>, touching, grasping, and sound production. The animal's sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a <a href="bloodhound">bloodhound</a>. The trunk's ability to make powerful twisting and coiling movements allows it to collect food, wrestle with other elephants, and lift up to . It can be used for delicate tasks, such as wiping an eye and checking an orifice, and is capable of cracking a peanut shell without breaking the seed. With its trunk, an elephant can reach items at heights of up to and dig for water under mud or sand. Individuals may show lateral preference when grasping with their trunks: some prefer to twist them to the left, others to the right. Elephants can suck up water both to drink and to spray on their bodies. An adult Asian elephant is capable of holding of water in its trunk. They will also spray dust or grass on themselves. When underwater, the elephant uses its trunk as a <a href="Submarine%20snorkel">snorkel</a>.

The African elephant has two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. <a href="Floppy%20trunk%20syndrome">Floppy trunk syndrome</a> is a condition of trunk <a href="paralysis">paralysis</a> in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the <a href="Peripheral%20nervous%20system">peripheral nerves</a> and muscles beginning at the tip.

Elephants usually have 26 teeth: the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s, known as the <a href="tusk">tusk</a>s, 12 <a href="Deciduous%20teeth">deciduous</a> <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s, and 12 <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>. Unlike most mammals, which <a href="Tooth%20development">grow baby teeth</a> and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are <a href="polyphyodont">polyphyodont</a>s that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. The third set falls out at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth falls out at the early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.

The tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous <a href="milk%20teeth">milk teeth</a> at 6–12 months of age and grow continuously at about a year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> cap that eventually wears off. The <a href="dentin">dentin</a>e is known as <a href="ivory">ivory</a> and its <a href="Cross%20section%20%28geometry%29">cross-section</a> consists of crisscrossing line patterns, known as "engine turning", which create diamond-shaped areas. As a piece of living tissue, a tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral <a href="calcite">calcite</a>. Much of the tusk can be seen outside; the rest is in a socket in the skull. At least one-third of the tusk contains the <a href="Pulp%20%28tooth%29">pulp</a> and some have nerves stretching to the tip. Thus it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal. When removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist. Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.

Like humans, who are typically <a href="Handedness">right- or left-handed</a>, elephants are usually right- or left-tusked. The dominant tusk, called the master tusk, is generally more worn down, as it is shorter with a rounder tip. For the African elephants, tusks are present in both males and females, and are around the same length in both sexes, reaching up to , but those of males tend to be thicker. In earlier times, elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds (more than 90 kg) were not uncommon, though it is rare today to see any over .

In the Asian species, only the males have large tusks. Female Asians have very small tusks, or none at all. Tuskless males exist and are particularly common among Sri Lankan elephants. Asian males can have tusks as long as Africans', but they are usually slimmer and lighter; the largest recorded was long and weighed . Hunting for elephant ivory in Africa and Asia has led to <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> for shorter tusks and tusklessness.

An elephant's skin is generally very tough, at thick on the back and parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, <a href="anus">anus</a>, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin, <a href="Sex%20organ">genitals</a> and the areas around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart.

An elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular <a href="mud%20bath">mud bath</a>s to protect it from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low <a href="surface-area-to-volume%20ratio">surface-area-to-volume ratio</a>, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.

To support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have <a href="cancellous%20bone">cancellous bone</a> in place of <a href="medullary%20cavity">medullary cavities</a>. This strengthens the bones while still allowing <a href="haematopoiesis">haematopoiesis</a>. Both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the front. Since the limb bones are placed on top of each other and under the body, an elephant can stand still for long periods of time without using much energy. Elephants are incapable of rotating their front legs, as the <a href="ulna">ulna</a> and <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> are fixed in <a href="pronation">pronation</a>; the "palm" of the manus faces backward. The <a href="Pronator%20quadratus%20muscle">pronator quadratus</a> and the <a href="Pronator%20teres%20muscle">pronator teres</a> are either reduced or absent. The circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or "cushion pads" beneath the <a href="Manus%20%28anatomy%29">manus</a> or <a href="Pes%20%28anatomy%29">pes</a>, which distribute the weight of the animal. They appear to have a <a href="Sesamoid%20bone">sesamoid</a>, an extra "toe" similar in placement to a <a href="giant%20panda">giant panda</a>'s extra "thumb", that also helps in weight distribution. As many as five toenails can be found on both the front and hind feet.

Elephants can move both forwards and backwards, but cannot <a href="trot">trot</a>, <a href="jumping">jump</a>, or <a href="Horse%20gait">gallop</a>. They use only two gaits when moving on land: the walk and a faster gait similar to running. In walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground. With no "aerial phase", the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground. Fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their hind legs and can reach a top speed of . At this speed, most other <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadrupeds</a> are well into a gallop, even accounting for leg length. Spring-like kinetics could explain the difference between the motion of elephants and other animals. During locomotion, the cushion pads expand and contract, and reduce both the pain and noise that would come from a very heavy animal moving. Elephants are capable swimmers. They have been recorded swimming for up to six hours without touching the bottom, and have travelled as far as at a stretch and at speeds of up to .

The brain of an elephant weighs compared to for a human brain. While the elephant brain is larger overall, it is proportionally smaller. At birth, an elephant's brain already weighs 30–40% of its adult weight. The <a href="cerebrum">cerebrum</a> and <a href="cerebellum">cerebellum</a> are well developed, and the <a href="temporal%20lobe">temporal lobe</a>s are so large that they bulge out laterally. The throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later use.

The heart of an elephant weighs . It has a double-pointed <a href="apex%20of%20the%20heart">apex</a>, an unusual trait among mammals. In addition, the <a href="Ventricle%20%28heart%29">ventricles</a> separate near the top of the heart, a trait they share with sirenians. When standing, the elephant's heart beats approximately 30 times per minute. Unlike many other animals, the heart rate speeds up by 8 to 10 beats per minute when the elephant is lying down. The blood vessels in most of the body are wide and thick and can withstand high blood pressures. The lungs are attached to the <a href="Thoracic%20diaphragm">diaphragm</a>, and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage. <a href="Connective%20tissue">Connective tissue</a> exists in place of the <a href="pleural%20cavity">pleural cavity</a>. This may allow the animal to deal with the pressure differences when its body is underwater and its trunk is breaking the surface for air, although this explanation has been questioned. Another possible function for this adaptation is that it helps the animal suck up water through the trunk. Elephants inhale mostly through the trunk, although some air goes through the mouth. They have a <a href="hindgut%20fermentation">hindgut fermentation</a> system, and their large and small intestines together reach in length. The majority of an elephant's food intake goes undigested despite the process lasting up to a day.

A male elephant's testes are located internally near the kidneys. The elephant's <a href="penis">penis</a> can reach a length of and a diameter of at the base. It is S-shaped when fully erect and has a Y-shaped <a href="External%20urethral%20orifice%20%28male%29">orifice</a>. The female has a well-developed <a href="clitoris">clitoris</a> at up to . The vulva is located between the hind legs instead of near the tail as in most mammals. Determining pregnancy status can be difficult due to the animal's large <a href="abdominal%20cavity">abdominal cavity</a>. The female's <a href="mammary%20gland">mammary gland</a>s occupy the space between the front legs, which puts the suckling calf within reach of the female's trunk. Elephants have a unique organ, the <a href="Temporin">temporal gland</a>, located in both sides of the head. This organ is associated with sexual behaviour, and males secrete a fluid from it when in <a href="musth">musth</a>. Females have also been observed with secretions from the temporal glands.

The African bush elephant can be found in habitats as diverse as dry <a href="savanna">savanna</a>hs, <a href="desert">desert</a>s, <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es, and lake shores, and in elevations from sea level to mountain areas above the <a href="snow%20line">snow line</a>. Forest elephants mainly live in <a href="Atlantic%20Equatorial%20coastal%20forests">equatorial forests</a> but will enter <a href="gallery%20forest">gallery forest</a>s and <a href="ecotone">ecotone</a>s between forests and savannahs. Asian elephants prefer areas with a mix of grasses, low woody plants, and trees, primarily inhabiting dry <a href="Deccan%20thorn%20scrub%20forests">thorn-scrub forests</a> in southern India and Sri Lanka and <a href="evergreen%20forest">evergreen forest</a>s in <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malaya</a>. Elephants are <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a> and will eat leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, grass and roots. They are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation. African elephants are mostly <a href="Browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browsers</a> while Asian elephants are mainly <a href="Grazing">grazers</a>. They can consume as much as of food and of water in a day. Elephants tend to stay near water sources. Major feeding bouts take place in the morning, afternoon and night. At midday, elephants rest under trees and may doze off while standing. Sleeping occurs at night while the animal is lying down. Elephants average 3–4 hours of sleep per day. Both males and family groups typically move a day, but distances as far as have been recorded in the <a href="Etosha%20National%20Park">Etosha</a> region of Namibia. Elephants go on seasonal migrations in search of food, water, minerals, and mates. At <a href="Chobe%20National%20Park">Chobe National Park</a>, Botswana, herds travel to visit the river when the local waterholes dry up.

Because of their large size, elephants have a huge impact on their environments and are considered <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a>. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At <a href="Mount%20Elgon">Mount Elgon</a>, elephants excavate caves that are used by <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects. Elephants are important <a href="Seed%20dispersal">seed dispersers</a>; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on <a href="germination">germination</a>. The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a> for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the <a href="Malayan%20tapir">tapir</a>. Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as <a href="dung%20beetle">dung beetle</a>s and monkeys. Elephants can have a negative impact on ecosystems. At <a href="Murchison%20Falls%20National%20Park">Murchison Falls National Park</a> in Uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to <a href="surface%20runoff">run off</a>, leading to <a href="erosion">erosion</a>.

Elephants typically coexist peacefully with other herbivores, which will usually stay out of their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At <a href="Aberdare%20National%20Park">Aberdare National Park</a>, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At <a href="Hluhluwe%E2%80%93iMfolozi%20Park">Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that claimed the lives of 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by <a href="lion">lion</a>s, <a href="spotted%20hyena">spotted hyena</a>s, and <a href="Lycaon%20pictus">wild dogs</a> in Africa and <a href="tiger">tiger</a>s in Asia. The lions of <a href="Chobe%20National%20Park%23Geography%20and%20ecosystems">Savuti</a>, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller predators like <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s (which have not been recorded killing calves); they react to leopards less fearfully and more aggressively. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.

Female elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit <a href="Matrilineality">matrilineal</a> family groups, some of which are made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the <a href="Matriarchy">matriarch</a> which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal <a href="corticosterone">corticosterone</a> ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. One study found that younger matriarchs are more likely than older ones to under-react to severe danger.

The social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit. In the case of elephants in <a href="Amboseli%20National%20Park">Amboseli National Park</a>, Kenya, a female's life involves interaction with other families, clans, and subpopulations. Families may associate and bond with each other, forming what are known as bond groups. These are typically made of two family groups, which may be closely related due to previously being part of the same family group which split after becoming too large for the available resources. During the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social organisation known as the clan. Groups within these clans do not form strong bonds, but they defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. There are typically nine groups in a clan. The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the "central" and "peripheral" subpopulations.

Some elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations. There appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. They have been observed to have "nursing units" and "juvenile-care units". In southern India, elephant populations may contain family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, consisting of one or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than two adult females plus offspring is known as a "joint family". Malay elephant populations have even smaller family units, and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group. Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other, especially at forest clearings.

The social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time at the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli, young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14–15. When males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of bulls in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two or more individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of over 10 members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to 144 individuals. These elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mates, and will form long-term relationships. A <a href="dominance%20hierarchy">dominance hierarchy</a> exists among males, whether they range socially or solitarily. Dominance depends on the age, size and sexual condition, and when in groups, males follow the lead of the dominant bull. Young bulls may seek out the company and leadership of older, more experienced males, whose presence appears to control their aggression and prevent them from exhibiting "deviant" behaviour. Adult males and females come together for reproduction. Bulls associate with family groups if an <a href="Estrous%20cycle">oestrous</a> cow is present.

Adult males enter a state of increased <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a> known as <a href="musth">musth</a>. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth at the age of 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the <a href="Temporin">temporal gland</a> that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his <a href="penile%20sheath">sheath</a>, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.

Males become extremely aggressive during musth. Size is the determining factor in <a href="Agonistic%20behaviour">agonistic</a> encounters when the individuals have the same condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win the majority of the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.

Elephants are <a href="Polygyny">polygynous</a> breeders, and <a href="animal%20sexual%20behaviour">copulations</a> are most frequent during the peak of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (<a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the <a href="flehmen%20response">flehmen response</a>, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the <a href="vomeronasal%20organ">vomeronasal organ</a>. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week <a href="follicular%20phase">follicular phase</a> and an 8- to 10-week <a href="luteal%20phase">luteal phase</a>. While most mammals have one surge of <a href="luteinizing%20hormone">luteinizing hormone</a> during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but <a href="ovulation">ovulation</a> does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.

Bulls engage in a behaviour known as mate-guarding, where they follow oestrous females and defend them from other males. Most mate-guarding is done by musth males, and females actively seek to be guarded by them, particularly older ones. Thus these bulls have more reproductive success. Musth appears to signal to females the condition of the male, as weak or injured males do not have normal musths. For young females, the approach of an older bull can be intimidating, so her relatives stay nearby to provide support and reassurance. During copulation, the male lays his trunk over the female's back. The penis is very mobile, being able to move independently of the pelvis. Prior to mounting, it curves forward and upward. Copulation lasts about 45 seconds and does not involve <a href="pelvic%20thrust">pelvic thrust</a>ing or ejaculatory pause. Elephant sperm must swim close to to reach the egg. By comparison, human sperm has to swim around only .

<a href="Homosexual%20behavior%20in%20animals%23Elephants">Homosexual behaviour</a> is frequent in both sexes. As in heterosexual interactions, this involves mounting. Male elephants sometimes stimulate each other by playfighting and "championships" may form between old bulls and younger males. Female same-sex behaviours have been documented only in captivity where they are known to <a href="Animal%20sexual%20behaviour%23Autoeroticism%20or%20masturbation">masturbate one another</a> with their trunks.

<a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> in elephants typically lasts around two years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years. Births tend to take place during the wet season. Calves are born tall and weigh around . Typically, only a single young is born, but twins sometimes occur. The relatively long pregnancy is maintained by five <a href="corpus%20luteum">corpus luteum</a>s (as opposed to one in most mammals) and gives the foetus more time to develop, particularly the brain and trunk. As such, newborn elephants are <a href="precocial">precocial</a> and quickly stand and walk to follow their mother and family herd. A new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members. Adults and most of the other young will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. For the first few days, the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young. <a href="Alloparenting">Alloparenting</a> – where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother – takes place in some family groups. Allomothers are typically two to twelve years old. When a predator is near, the family group gathers together with the calves in the centre.

For the first few days, the newborn is unsteady on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.

For its first three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle at the same rate as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.

Play behaviour in calves differs between the sexes; females run or chase each other while males play-fight. The former are <a href="sexually%20mature">sexually mature</a> by the age of nine years while the latter become mature around 14–15 years. Adulthood starts at about 18 years of age in both sexes. Elephants have long lifespans, reaching 60–70 years of age. <a href="Lin%20Wang">Lin Wang</a>, a captive male Asian elephant, lived for 86 years.

Touching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching is especially important for mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.

Visual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations. Elephants will try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.

Elephants produce several sounds, usually through the <a href="larynx">larynx</a>, though some may be <a href="Vocal%20resonation">modified</a> by the trunk. Perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk. Trumpeting is made during excitement, distress or aggression. Fighting elephants may roar or squeal, and wounded ones may bellow. <a href="Rumble%20%28noise%29">Rumbles</a> are produced during mild arousal and some appear to be <a href="infrasound">infrasonic</a>. Infrasonic calls are important, particularly for long-distance communication, in both Asian and African elephants. For Asian elephants, these calls have a frequency of 14–24 <a href="Hertz">Hz</a>, with <a href="sound%20pressure">sound pressure</a> levels of 85–90 <a href="Decibel">dB</a> and last 10–15 seconds. For African elephants, calls range from 15–35 Hz with sound pressure levels as high as 117 dB, allowing communication for many kilometres, with a possible maximum range of around .

At Amboseli, several different infrasonic calls have been identified. A greeting rumble is emitted by members of a family group after having been separated for several hours. Contact calls are soft, <a href="Modulation">unmodulated</a> sounds made by individuals that have been separated from their group and may be responded to with a "contact answer" call that starts out loud, but becomes softer. A "let's go" soft rumble is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd members that it is time to move to another spot. Bulls in musth emit a distinctive, low-frequency pulsated rumble nicknamed the "motorcycle". Musth rumbles may be answered by the "female chorus", a low-frequency, modulated chorus produced by several cows. A loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow after mating. When a cow has mated, her family may produce calls of excitement known as the "mating pandemonium".

Elephants are known to <a href="seismic%20communication">communicate with seismics</a>, vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface or acoustical waves that travel through it. They appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear. When detecting seismic signals, the animals lean forward and put more weight on their larger front feet; this is known as the "freezing behaviour". Elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication. The cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a>s like <a href="toothed%20whale">toothed whale</a>s and sirenians. A unique <a href="sphincter">sphincter</a>-like muscle around the <a href="ear%20canal">ear canal</a> constricts the passageway, thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals. Elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes. An individual running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances. When detecting the seismics of an alarm call signalling danger from predators, elephants enter a defensive posture and family groups will pack together. Seismic waveforms produced by locomotion appear to travel distances of up to while those from vocalisations travel .

Elephants exhibit <a href="Mirror%20test">mirror self-recognition</a>, an indication of <a href="self-awareness">self-awareness</a> and <a href="cognition">cognition</a> that has also been demonstrated in some <a href="ape">ape</a>s and <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>s. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the <a href="Tool%20use%20by%20animals">species known to use tools</a>. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as <a href="Fly-killing%20device">flyswatters</a>. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of <a href="Pan%20%28genus%29">chimpanzee</a>s. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have <a href="cognitive%20map">cognitive map</a>s to allow them to remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear to be able to keep track of the current location of their family members.

Scientists debate the extent to which elephants feel <a href="emotion">emotion</a>. They appear to show interest in the bones of their own kind, regardless of whether they are related. As with chimps and dolphins, a dying or dead elephant may elicit attention and aid from others, including those from other groups. This has been interpreted as expressing "concern"; however, others would dispute such an interpretation as being <a href="anthropomorphic">anthropomorphic</a>; the "Oxford Companion to Animal Behaviour" (1987) advised that "one is well advised to study the behaviour rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion".

African elephants were listed as <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) in 2008, with no independent assessment of the conservation status of the two forms. In 1979, Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3 million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0 million. By 1989, the population was estimated to be 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in <a href="East%20Africa">eastern Africa</a>, 204,000 in <a href="southern%20Africa">southern Africa</a>, and 19,000 in <a href="West%20Africa">western Africa</a>. About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> to <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a> experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in southern Africa were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>, <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> and <a href="Angola">Angola</a> while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa. Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%. Due to the vast areas involved, assessing the total African elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork. The IUCN estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012 while <a href="Traffic%20%28conservation%20programme%29">TRAFFIC</a> estimates as many as 55 are poached daily.

African elephants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found, but 70% of their range exists outside protected areas. Successful conservation efforts in certain areas have led to high population densities. As of 2008, local numbers were controlled by contraception or <a href="Species%20translocation">translocation</a>. Large-scale <a href="culling">culling</a>s ceased in 1988, when Zimbabwe abandoned the practice. In 1989, the African elephant was listed under Appendix I by the <a href="CITES">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES), making trade illegal. Appendix II status (which allows restricted trade) was given to elephants in Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe in 1997 and South Africa in 2000. In some countries, <a href="Trophy%20hunting">sport hunting</a> of the animals is legal; Botswana, Cameroon, <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a>, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have CITES export quotas for elephant trophies. In June 2016, the <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20Kenya">First Lady of Kenya</a>, <a href="Margaret%20Kenyatta">Margaret Kenyatta</a>, helped launch the East Africa Grass-Root Elephant Education Campaign Walk, organised by elephant conservationist <a href="Jim%20Nyamu">Jim Nyamu</a>. The event was conducted to raise awareness of the value of elephants and rhinos, to help mitigate human-elephant conflicts, and to promote anti-poaching activities.

In 2008, the IUCN listed the Asian elephant as <a href="endangered">endangered</a> due to a 50% population decline over the past 60–75 years while CITES lists the species under Appendix I. Asian elephants once ranged from <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> (the subspecies <a href="Syrian%20elephant">"Elephas maximus asurus"</a>), to China (up to the <a href="Yellow%20River">Yellow River</a>) and Java. It is now extinct in these areas, and the current range of Asian elephants is highly fragmented. The total population of Asian elephants is estimated to be around 40,000–50,000, although this may be a loose estimate. It is likely that around half of the population is in India. Although Asian elephants are declining in numbers overall, particularly in Southeast Asia, the population in the <a href="Western%20Ghats">Western Ghats</a> appears to be increasing.

The <a href="poaching">poaching</a> of elephants for their ivory, meat and hides has been one of the major threats to their existence. Historically, numerous cultures made ornaments and other works of art from elephant ivory, and its use rivalled that of gold. The ivory trade contributed to the African elephant population decline in the late 20th century. This prompted international bans on ivory imports, starting with the United States in June 1989, and followed by bans in other North American countries, western European countries, and Japan. Around the same time, Kenya destroyed all its ivory stocks. CITES approved an international ban on ivory that went into effect in January 1990. Following the bans, unemployment rose in India and China, where the ivory industry was important economically. By contrast, Japan and Hong Kong, which were also part of the industry, were able to adapt and were not badly affected. Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and <a href="Malawi">Malawi</a> wanted to continue the ivory trade and were allowed to, since their local elephant populations were healthy, but only if their supplies were from elephants that had been culled or died of natural causes.

The ban allowed the elephant to recover in parts of Africa. In January 2012, 650 elephants in <a href="Bouba%20Njida%20National%20Park">Bouba Njida National Park</a>, Cameroon, were killed by <a href="Chad">Chad</a>ian raiders. This has been called "one of the worst concentrated killings" since the ivory ban. Asian elephants are potentially less vulnerable to the ivory trade, as females usually lack tusks. Still, members of the species have been killed for their ivory in some areas, such as <a href="Periyar%20National%20Park">Periyar National Park</a> in India. China was the biggest market for poached ivory but announced they would phase out the legal domestic manufacture and sale of ivory products in May 2015, and in September 2015, China and the United States said "they would enact a nearly complete ban on the import and export of ivory" due to causes of extinction.

Other threats to elephants include <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> and <a href="Habitat%20fragmentation">fragmentation</a>. The Asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations. Because they need larger amounts of land than other <a href="Sympatry">sympatric</a> terrestrial mammals, they are the first to be affected by human encroachment. In extreme cases, elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants cannot coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation. One proposed solution is the provision of ‘urban corridors’ which allow the animals access to key areas.

Elephants have been <a href="working%20animal">working animal</a>s since at least the <a href="Indus%20Valley%20Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a> and continue to be used in modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life. They were <a href="Mela%20shikar">traditionally captured with traps and lassos</a>, but since 1950, <a href="sedative">tranquillisers</a> have been used.

Individuals of the Asian species have been often trained as working animals. Asian elephants perform tasks such as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around <a href="national%20park">national park</a>s, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, the animals are used to digest coffee beans for <a href="Black%20Ivory%20coffee">Black Ivory coffee</a>. They are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous to work with and are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under <a href="The%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Animals%20Act%2C1960">The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960</a>.

In both Myanmar and Thailand, <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> and other economic factors have resulted in sizable populations of unemployed elephants resulting in health problems for the elephants themselves as well as economic and safety problems for the people amongst whom they live.

The practice of working elephants has also been attempted in Africa. The taming of African elephants in the <a href="Belgian%20Congo">Belgian Congo</a> began by decree of <a href="Leopold%20II%20of%20Belgium">Leopold II of Belgium</a> during the 19th century and continues to the present with the <a href="Api%20Elephant%20Domestication%20Center">Api Elephant Domestication Centre</a>.

Historically, elephants were considered formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armour to protect their sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale him.

One of the earliest references to war elephants is in the Indian epic "<a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>" (written in the 4th century BC, but said to describe events between the 11th and 8th centuries BC). They were not used as much as horse-drawn chariots by either the <a href="Pandava">Pandava</a>s or <a href="Kaurava">Kaurava</a>s. During the <a href="Magadha%20Kingdom">Magadha Kingdom</a> (which began in the 6th century BC), elephants began to achieve greater cultural importance than horses, and later Indian kingdoms used war elephants extensively; 3,000 of them were used in the <a href="Nanda%20Empire">Nandas</a> (5th and 4th centuries BC) army while 9,000 may have been used in the <a href="Maurya%20Empire">Mauryan army</a> (between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC). The "<a href="Arthashastra">Arthashastra</a>" (written around 300 BC) advised the Mauryan government to reserve some forests for wild elephants for use in the army, and to execute anyone who killed them. From South Asia, the use of elephants in warfare spread west to <a href="Iran">Persia</a> and east to Southeast Asia. The Persians used them during the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> (between the 6th and 4th centuries BC) while Southeast Asian states first used war elephants possibly as early as the 5th century BC and continued to the 20th century.

In his 326 B.C. Indian campaign, <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> confronted elephants for the first time, and suffered heavy casualties. Among the reasons for the refusal of the rank-and-file Macedonian soldiers to continue the Indian conquest were rumors of even larger elephant armies in India. Alexander trained his foot soldiers to injure the animals and cause them to panic during wars with both the Persians and Indians. <a href="Ptolemy%20I%20Soter">Ptolemy</a>, who was one of Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor <a href="Ptolemy%20II%20Philadelphus">Ptolemy II</a> (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical period</a>. The Greek king <a href="Pyrrhus%20of%20Epirus">Pyrrhus</a> used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The <a href="Carthage">Carthaginian</a> general <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a> took elephants across the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> during his war with the Romans and reached the <a href="Po%20Valley">Po Valley</a> in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.

Overall, elephants owed their initial successes to the element of surprise and to the fear that their great size invoked. With time, strategists devised counter-measures and war elephants turned into an expensive liability and were hardly ever used by Romans and <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthians</a>.

Elephants were historically kept for display in the <a href="menagerie">menagerie</a>s of <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, <a href="Elephants%20in%20ancient%20China">China</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greece</a>, and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>. The Romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a> events. In the <a href="Modern%20history">modern era</a>, elephants have traditionally been a major part of <a href="zoo">zoo</a>s and <a href="circus">circus</a>es around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant was probably <a href="Jumbo">Jumbo</a> (1861 – 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the <a href="Ringling%20Bros.%20and%20Barnum%20%26amp%3B%20Bailey%20Circus">Barnum & Bailey Circus</a>. These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals. As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. The largest captive population is in North America, which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African elephants. About 380 Asians and 190 Africans are known to exist in Europe, and Japan has around 70 Asians and 67 Africans.
Keeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying <a href="Stereotypy%20%28non-human%29">stereotypical behaviours</a> in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.

The use of elephants in circuses has also been controversial; the <a href="Humane%20Society%20of%20the%20United%20States">Humane Society of the United States</a> has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO <a href="Kenneth%20Jeffrey%20Feld">Kenneth Feld</a> acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called <a href="Elephant%20goad">bull hooks</a> or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied that any of these practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. <a href="Ralph%20Helfer">Ralph Helfer</a> is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.

Elephants can exhibit bouts of aggressive behaviour and engage in destructive actions against humans. In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive. In parts of India, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in <a href="Jharkhand">Jharkhand</a> while in <a href="Assam">Assam</a>, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.
Local people have reported their belief that some elephants were drunk during their attacks, although officials have disputed this explanation. Purportedly drunk elephants attacked an Indian village a second time in December 2002, killing six people, which led to the killing of about 200 elephants by locals.

In many cultures, elephants represent strength, power, wisdom, longevity, stamina, leadership, sociability, nurturance and loyalty. Several cultural references emphasise the elephant's size and exotic uniqueness. For instance, a "<a href="white%20elephant">white elephant</a>" is a byword for something expensive, useless, and bizarre. The expression "<a href="elephant%20in%20the%20room">elephant in the room</a>" refers to an obvious truth that is ignored or otherwise unaddressed. The story of the <a href="blind%20men%20and%20an%20elephant">blind men and an elephant</a> teaches that reality may be viewed by different perspectives.

Elephants have been represented in art since <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> times. Africa, in particular, contains many rock paintings and engravings of the animals, especially in the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> and southern Africa. In Asia, the animals are depicted as <a href="Motif%20%28visual%20arts%29">motifs</a> in <a href="Jain">Jain</a>, <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> shrines and temples. Elephants were often difficult to portray by people with no first-hand experience with them. The <a href="Ancient%20Rome">ancient Romans</a>, who kept the animals in captivity, depicted anatomically accurate elephants on <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a>s in <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> and Sicily. At the beginning of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> when Europeans had little to no access to the animals, elephants were portrayed more like fantasy creatures. They were often depicted with horse- or bovine-like bodies with trumpet-like trunks and tusks like a boar; some were even given hooves. Elephants were commonly featured in motifs by the stonemasons of the <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> churches. As more elephants began to be sent to European kings as gifts during the 15th century, depictions of them became more accurate, including one made by <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. Despite this, some Europeans continued to portray them in a more stylised fashion. <a href="Max%20Ernst">Max Ernst</a>'s 1921 <a href="Surrealism">surrealist</a> painting, "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Celebes">The Elephant Celebes</a>," depicts an elephant as a <a href="silo">silo</a> with a trunk-like hose protruding from it.

Elephants have been the subject of religious beliefs. The <a href="Mbuti%20people">Mbuti people</a> of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants. Similar ideas existed among other African tribes, who believed that their chiefs would be <a href="reincarnation">reincarnated</a> as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of <a href="Igbo-Ukwu">Igbo-Ukwu</a>, near the <a href="Niger%20Delta">Niger Delta</a>, buried their leaders with elephant tusks. The animals' religious importance is only <a href="Totemism">totemic</a> in Africa but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as <a href="Airavata">Airavata</a>, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows. One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed <a href="Ganesha">Ganesha</a>, is ranked equal with the supreme gods <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>, <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, and <a href="Brahma">Brahma</a>. Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires. In Buddhism, <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Buddha</a> is said to have been a <a href="White%20elephant%20%28animal%29">white elephant</a> reincarnated as a human. According to Buddhist mythology, Gautama Buddha's mother, Maya, dreamt that a white elephant enter her womb. The astrologers of the king's court interpreted this dream as the impending birth of a great person who would either become a 'Chakravartin' (conqueror of the world) or a great sage. In <a href="Islam">Islam</a>ic tradition, the year 570 when <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> was born is known as the <a href="Year%20of%20the%20Elephant">Year of the Elephant</a>. Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars.

Elephants are ubiquitous in Western <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a> as emblems of the exotic, especially since – as with the <a href="giraffe">giraffe</a>, <a href="hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a> and <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a> – there are no similar animals familiar to Western audiences. The use of the elephant as a symbol of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">US Republican Party</a> began with an <a href="Republican%20elephant">1874 cartoon</a> by <a href="Thomas%20Nast">Thomas Nast</a>. As characters, elephants are most common in children's stories, in which they are generally cast as models of exemplary behaviour. They are typically surrogates for humans with ideal human values. Many stories tell of isolated young elephants returning to a close-knit community, such as "The Elephant's Child" from <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s "<a href="Just%20So%20Stories">Just So Stories</a>", <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a>'s "<a href="Dumbo">Dumbo</a>," and Kathryn and Byron Jackson's "The Saggy Baggy Elephant". Other elephant heroes <a href="Anthropomorphism">given human qualities</a> include <a href="Jean%20de%20Brunhoff">Jean de Brunhoff</a>'s <a href="Babar%20the%20Elephant">Babar</a>, <a href="David%20McKee">David McKee</a>'s <a href="Elmer%20the%20Patchwork%20Elephant">Elmer</a>, and <a href="Dr.%20Seuss">Dr. Seuss</a>'s <a href="Horton%20the%20Elephant">Horton</a>.

European Parliament

The European Parliament (EP) is the only parliamentary <a href="Institutions%20of%20the%20European%20Union">institution of the European Union (EU)</a> that is <a href="direct%20election">directly elected</a> by EU citizens aged 18 or older. Together with the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Council of the European Union</a> (also known as the 'Council'), which should not be confused with the <a href="European%20Council">European Council</a> and the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a>, it exercises the legislative function of the EU. The Parliament is composed of 751 <a href="Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">members</a> (MEPs), that will become 705 starting from the 2019–2024 legislature (because of <a href="Apportionment%20in%20the%20European%20Parliament">specific provisions</a> adopted about <a href="Brexit">Brexit</a>), who represent the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the <a href="Parliament%20of%20India">Parliament of India</a>) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (375 million eligible <a href="Voting">voters</a> in 2009).

It has been directly elected by the European citizens (each EU Member State's national has his state's nationality and EU one consequently) every five years and by <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a> since 1979. However, <a href="voter%20turnout">voter turnout</a> at <a href="Elections%20in%20the%20European%20Union">European Parliament elections</a> has fallen consecutively at each election since that date, and has been under 50% since 1999. Voter turnout in 2014 stood at 42.54% of all European voters.

Although the European Parliament has legislative power, as does the Council, it does not formally possess <a href="legislative%20initiative">legislative initiative</a> (which is the prerogative of the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a>), as most <a href="National%20parliaments%20of%20the%20European%20Union">national parliaments</a> of European Union member states do. The Parliament is the "first institution" of the EU (mentioned first in the <a href="Treaties%20of%20the%20European%20Union">treaties</a>, having ceremonial precedence over all authority at European level), and shares equal legislative and budgetary powers with the Council (except in a few areas where the <a href="Legislature%20of%20the%20European%20Union%23Special%20legislative%20procedures">special legislative procedures</a> apply). It likewise has equal control over the <a href="Budget%20of%20the%20European%20Union">EU budget</a>. Finally, the European Commission, the executive body of the EU (it exercises executive powers, but no legislative ones other than legislative initiative), is accountable to Parliament. In particular, Parliament elects the President of the Commission, and approves (or rejects) the appointment of the Commission as a whole. It can subsequently force the Commission as a body to resign by adopting a motion of censure.

The <a href="President%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">President of the European Parliament</a> (Parliament's <a href="Speaker%20%28politics%29">speaker</a>) is <a href="Antonio%20Tajani">Antonio Tajani</a> (<a href="European%20People%27s%20Party">EPP</a>), elected in January 2017. He presides over a multi-party chamber, the two largest groups being the <a href="European%20People%27s%20Party%20%28European%20Parliament%20group%29">Group of the European People's Party</a> (EPP) and the <a href="Progressive%20Alliance%20of%20Socialists%20and%20Democrats">Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats</a> (S&D). The last union-wide elections were the <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%202014">2014 elections</a>.

The European Parliament has three places of work – <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> (Belgium), <a href="Luxembourg%20City">Luxembourg City</a> (Luxembourg) and <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a> (France).
Luxembourg City is home to the administrative offices (the "General Secretariat"). Meetings of the whole Parliament ("plenary sessions") take place in Strasbourg and in Brussels. Committee meetings are held in Brussels.

The Parliament, like the other institutions, was not designed in its current form when it first met on 10 September 1952. One of the oldest common institutions, it began as the "Common Assembly" of the <a href="European%20Coal%20and%20Steel%20Community">European Coal and Steel Community</a> (ECSC). It was a consultative assembly of 78 appointed parliamentarians <a href="dual%20mandate">drawn</a> from the national parliaments of member states, having no legislative powers. The change since its foundation was highlighted by Professor David Farrell of the <a href="University%20of%20Manchester">University of Manchester</a>: "For much of its life, the European Parliament could have been justly labelled a 'multi-lingual talking shop'."

Its development since its foundation shows how the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>'s structures have evolved without a clear "master plan". Some, such as Tom Reid of the "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>", said of the union: "nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU". Even the Parliament's <a href="Location%20of%20European%20Union%20institutions%23European%20Parliament">two seats</a>, which have switched several times, are a result of various agreements or lack of agreements. Although most <a href="Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">MEP</a>s would prefer to be based just in Brussels, at <a href="John%20Major">John Major</a>'s 1992 Edinburgh <a href="European%20Council">summit</a>, France engineered a treaty amendment to maintain Parliament's plenary seat permanently at Strasbourg.

The body was not mentioned in the original <a href="Schuman%20Declaration">Schuman Declaration</a>. It was assumed or hoped that difficulties with the British would be resolved to allow the <a href="Parliamentary%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe's Assembly</a> to perform the task. A separate Assembly was introduced during negotiations on the Treaty as an institution which would counterbalance and monitor the <a href="Executive%20%28government%29">executive</a> while providing democratic legitimacy. The wording of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281951%29">ECSC Treaty</a> demonstrated the leaders' desire for more than a normal consultative assembly by using the term "representatives of the people" and allowed for direct election. Its early importance was highlighted when the Assembly was given the task of drawing up the draft treaty to establish a <a href="European%20Political%20Community">European Political Community</a>. By this document, the Ad Hoc Assembly was established on 13 September 1952 with extra members, but after the failure of the proposed <a href="European%20Defence%20Community">European Defence Community</a> the project was dropped. 

Despite this, the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a> and <a href="Euratom">Euratom</a> were established in 1958 by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Rome">Treaties of Rome</a>. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the "European Parliamentary Assembly". The first meeting was held on 19 March 1958 having been set up in Luxembourg City, it elected Schuman as its president and on 13 May it rearranged itself to sit according to political ideology rather than nationality. This is seen as the birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament's 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.

The three communities <a href="Merger%20Treaty">merged</a> their remaining organs as the <a href="European%20Communities">European Communities</a> in 1967, and the body's name was changed to the current "European Parliament" in 1962. In 1970 the Parliament was granted power over areas of the <a href="Budget%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Communities' budget</a>, which were expanded to the whole budget in 1975. Under the Rome Treaties, the Parliament should have become elected. However, the Council was required to agree a uniform voting system beforehand, which it failed to do. The Parliament threatened to take the Council to the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Justice">European Court of Justice</a>; this led to a compromise whereby the Council would agree to elections, but the issue of voting systems would be put off until a later date.

In 1979, its members were <a href="Elections%20in%20the%20European%20Union">directly elected</a> for the <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%201979">first time</a>. This sets it apart from similar institutions such as those of the <a href="Parliamentary%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Council%20of%20Europe">Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe</a> or <a href="Pan-African%20Parliament">Pan-African Parliament</a> which are appointed. After that first election, the parliament held its first session on 11 July 1979, electing <a href="Simone%20Veil">Simone Veil</a> MEP as its president. Veil was also the first female president of the Parliament since it was formed as the Common Assembly.

As an elected body, the Parliament began to draft proposals addressing the functioning of the EU. For example, in 1984, inspired by its previous work on the Political Community, it drafted the "draft Treaty establishing the European Union" (also known as the 'Spinelli Plan' after its rapporteur <a href="Altiero%20Spinelli">Altiero Spinelli</a> MEP). Although it was not adopted, many ideas were later implemented by other treaties. Furthermore, the Parliament began holding votes on proposed <a href="President%20of%20the%20European%20Commission">Commission Presidents</a> from the 1980s, before it was given any formal right to veto.

Since it became an elected body, the membership of the European Parliament has simply expanded whenever new nations have joined (the membership was also adjusted upwards in 1994 after <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>). Following this, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Nice">Treaty of Nice</a> imposed a cap on the number of members to be elected, 732. 

Like the other institutions, the Parliament's <a href="Seat%20%28legal%20entity%29">seat</a> was not yet fixed. The provisional arrangements placed Parliament in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing to be closer to these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the <a href="European%20Council">European Council</a> in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amsterdam">Treaty of Amsterdam</a>. To this day the <a href="Location%20of%20European%20Union%20institutions">institution's locations</a> are a source of contention.

The Parliament gained more powers from successive treaties, namely through the extension of the <a href="ordinary%20legislative%20procedure">ordinary legislative procedure</a> (then called the codecision procedure), and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the <a href="Santer%20Commission">Santer Commission</a>. The Parliament had refused to approve the <a href="Budget%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Community budget</a> over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, in the face of an impending censure from the Parliament.

In 2004, following the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted pressure on the Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed <a href="European%20Commissioner">Commissioners</a> MEPs raised doubts about some nominees with the <a href="Committee%20on%20Civil%20Liberties%2C%20Justice%20and%20Home%20Affairs">Civil Liberties committee</a> rejecting <a href="Rocco%20Buttiglione">Rocco Buttiglione</a> from the post of <a href="European%20Commissioner%20for%20Justice%2C%20Freedom%20and%20Security">Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security</a> over his views on homosexuality. That was the first time the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament allowed the <a href="Barroso%20Commission">Barroso Commission</a> to take office.
Along with the extension of the ordinary legislative procedure, the Parliament's democratic mandate has given it greater control over legislation against the other institutions. In voting on the <a href="Bolkestein%20directive">Bolkestein directive</a> in 2006, the Parliament voted by a large majority for over 400 amendments that changed the fundamental principle of the law. The "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" described it in the following terms:
In 2007, for the first time, Justice Commissioner <a href="Franco%20Frattini">Franco Frattini</a> included Parliament in talks on the second <a href="Schengen%20Information%20System">Schengen Information System</a> even though MEPs only needed to be consulted on parts of the package. After that experiment, Frattini indicated he would like to include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they could gain as part of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lisbon">Treaty of Lisbon</a>. Between 2007 and 2009, a <a href="special%20working%20group%20on%20parliamentary%20reform">special working group on parliamentary reform</a> implemented a series of changes to modernise the institution such as more speaking time for rapporteurs, increase committee co-operation and other efficiency reforms.

The <a href="Lisbon%20Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a> finally came into force on 1 December 2009, granting Parliament powers over the entire <a href="Budget%20of%20the%20European%20Union">EU budget</a>, making Parliament's <a href="Ordinary%20legislative%20procedure">legislative powers</a> equal to the Council's in nearly all areas and linking the appointment of the <a href="President%20of%20the%20European%20Commission">Commission President</a> to Parliament's own elections. Despite some calls for the parties to put forward candidates beforehand, only the <a href="European%20People%27s%20Party">EPP</a> (which had re-secured their position as largest party) had one in re-endorsing Barroso.

Barroso gained the support of the European Council for a second term and secured majority support from the Parliament in September 2009. Parliament voted 382 votes in favour and 219 votes against (117 abstentions ) with support of the <a href="European%20People%27s%20Party">European People's Party</a>, <a href="European%20Conservatives%20and%20Reformists">European Conservatives and Reformists</a> and the <a href="Alliance%20of%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats%20for%20Europe">Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe</a>. The liberals gave support after Barroso gave them a number of concessions; the liberals previously joined the socialists' call for a delayed vote (the <a href="European%20People%27s%20Party">EPP</a> had wanted to approve Barroso in July of that year).

Once Barroso put forward the candidates for his next Commission, another opportunity to gain concessions arose. Bulgarian nominee <a href="Rumiana%20Jeleva">Rumiana Jeleva</a> was forced to step down by Parliament due to concerns over her experience and financial interests. She only had the support of the <a href="European%20People%27s%20Party">EPP</a> which began to retaliate on left wing candidates before Jeleva gave in and was replaced (setting back the final vote further).

Before the final vote, Parliament demanded a number of concessions as part of a future working agreement under the new Lisbon Treaty. The deal includes that Parliament's President will attend high level Commission meetings. Parliament will have a seat in the EU's Commission-led international negotiations and have a right to information on agreements. However, Parliament secured only an observer seat. Parliament also did not secure a say over the appointment of <a href="List%20of%20diplomatic%20missions%20of%20the%20European%20Union">delegation</a> heads and <a href="European%20Union%20Special%20Representative">special representatives</a> for foreign policy. Although they will appear before parliament after they have been appointed by the <a href="High%20Representative">High Representative</a>. One major internal power was that Parliament wanted a pledge from the Commission that it would put forward legislation when parliament requests. Barroso considered this an infringement on the Commission's powers but did agree to respond within three months. Most requests are already responded to positively.

During the setting up of the <a href="European%20External%20Action%20Service">European External Action Service</a> (EEAS), Parliament used its control over the EU budget to influence the shape of the EEAS. MEPs had aimed at getting greater oversight over the EEAS by linking it to the Commission and having political deputies to the <a href="High%20Representative%20of%20the%20Union%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%20and%20Security%20Policy">High Representative</a>. MEPs didn't manage to get everything they demanded. However, they got broader financial control over the new body.
In January 2019, Conservative MEPs supported proposals to boost opportunities for women and tackle sexual harassment in the European Parliament.

The Parliament and Council have been compared to the two <a href="Chambers%20of%20parliament">chambers</a> of a <a href="bicameral">bicameral</a> legislature. However, there are some differences from <a href="National%20parliaments%20of%20the%20European%20Union">national legislatures</a>; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of <a href="legislative%20initiative">legislative initiative</a> (except for the fact that the Council has the power in some <a href="Intergovernmentalism%23A%20theory%20of%20regional%20integration">intergovernmental</a> matters). In <a href="European%20Community">Community matters</a>, this is a power uniquely reserved for the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a <a href="Bill%20%28proposed%20law%29">bill</a> before anything can become law. The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law. Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president <a href="Hans-Gert%20P%C3%B6ttering">Hans-Gert Pöttering</a> that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a "de facto" right of legislative initiative.

The Parliament also has a great deal of indirect influence, through <a href="European%20Union%20law%23Legislation">non-binding resolutions</a> and <a href="Committees%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">committee hearings</a>, as a "pan-European <a href="soapbox">soapbox</a>" with the ear of <a href="Brussels%20and%20the%20European%20Union%23Lobbyists%20and%20journalists">thousands of Brussels-based journalists</a>. There is also an indirect effect on <a href="Common%20Foreign%20and%20Security%20Policy">foreign policy</a>; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for <a href="Iraq%20War">post-war Iraq</a> reconstruction, or incentives for the cessation of <a href="Nuclear%20program%20of%20Iran">Iranian nuclear development</a>, must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">transatlantic</a> passenger data-sharing deal with the United States. Finally, Parliament holds a non-binding vote on new EU treaties but cannot veto it. However, when Parliament threatened to vote down the Nice Treaty, the <a href="Belgian%20Federal%20Parliament">Belgian</a> and <a href="Parliament%20of%20Italy">Italian Parliaments</a> said they would veto the treaty on the European Parliament's behalf.

With each new treaty, the powers of the Parliament, in terms of its role in the <a href="Ordinary%20legislative%20procedure">Union's legislative procedures</a>, have expanded. The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the "<a href="ordinary%20legislative%20procedure">ordinary legislative procedure</a>" (previously named "codecision procedure"), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if both agree on a text, which they do (or not) through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a "common position". That position may either be approved by Parliament, or it may reject the text by an <a href="absolute%20majority">absolute majority</a>, causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a "Conciliation Committee" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority. This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the <a href="Bolkestein%20directive">Bolkestein directive</a> in 2006.

The few other areas that operate the "special legislative procedures" are justice and home affairs, budget and taxation, and certain aspects of other policy areas, such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy. In these areas, the Council or Parliament decide law alone. The procedure also depends upon which type of <a href="European%20Union%20law%23Legislation">institutional act</a> is being used. The strongest act is a <a href="Regulation%20%28European%20Union%29">regulation</a>, an <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">act</a> or <a href="Statutory%20law">law</a> which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are <a href="Directive%20%28European%20Union%29">directives</a> which bind member states to certain goals which they must achieve. They do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A <a href="European%20Union%20decision">decision</a> is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable. Institutions may also issue <a href="European%20Union%20recommendation">recommendations and opinions</a> which are merely non-binding, declarations. There is a further document which does not follow normal procedures, this is a "written declaration" which is similar to an <a href="early%20day%20motion">early day motion</a> used in the <a href="Westminster%20system">Westminster system</a>. It is a document proposed by up to five MEPs on a matter within the EU's activities used to launch a debate on that subject. Having been posted outside the entrance to the hemicycle, members can sign the declaration and if a majority do so it is forwarded to the President and announced to the plenary before being forwarded to the other institutions and formally noted in the minutes.

The legislative branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority with powers gained through the <a href="Budgetary%20treaties%20of%20the%20European%20Communities">Budgetary Treaties</a> of the 1970s and the <a href="Lisbon%20Treaty">Lisbon Treaty</a>. The <a href="Budget%20of%20the%20European%20Union">EU budget</a> is subject to a form of the ordinary legislative procedure with a single reading giving Parliament power over the entire budget (before 2009, its influence was limited to certain areas) on an equal footing to the Council. If there is a disagreement between them, it is taken to a conciliation committee as it is for legislative proposals. If the joint conciliation text is not approved, the Parliament may adopt the budget definitively.

The Parliament is also responsible for discharging the implementation of previous budgets based on the annual report of the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Auditors">European Court of Auditors</a>. It has refused to approve the budget only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion it led to the resignation of the <a href="Santer%20Commission">Santer Commission</a>; highlighting how the budgetary power gives Parliament a great deal of power over the Commission. Parliament also makes extensive use of its budgetary, and other powers, elsewhere; for example in the setting up of the <a href="European%20External%20Action%20Service">European External Action Service</a>, Parliament has a de facto veto over its design as it has to approve the budgetary and staff changes.

The <a href="President%20of%20the%20European%20Commission">President of the European Commission</a> is proposed by the European Council on the basis of the European elections to Parliament. That proposal has to be approved by the Parliament (by a simple majority) who "elect" the President according to the treaties. Following the approval of the Commission President, the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member states. Each Commissioner comes before a relevant parliamentary committee hearing covering the proposed portfolio. They are then, as a body, approved or rejected by the Parliament.

In practice, the Parliament has never voted against a President or his Commission, but it did seem likely when the Barroso Commission was put forward. The resulting pressure forced the proposal to be withdrawn and changed to be more acceptable to parliament. That pressure was seen as an important sign by some of the evolving nature of the Parliament and its ability to make the Commission accountable, rather than being a rubber stamp for candidates. Furthermore, in voting on the Commission, MEPs also voted along party lines, rather than national lines, despite frequent pressure from national governments on their MEPs. This cohesion and willingness to use the Parliament's power ensured greater attention from national leaders, other institutions and the public—who previously gave the lowest ever turnout for the Parliament's elections.

The Parliament also has the power to censure the Commission if they have a two-thirds majority which will force the resignation of the entire Commission from office. As with approval, this power has never been used but it was threatened to the <a href="Santer%20Commission">Santer Commission</a>, who subsequently <a href="Santer%20Commission%23Resignation">resigned of their own accord</a>. There are a few other controls, such as: the requirement of Commission to submit reports to the Parliament and answer questions from MEPs; the requirement of the President-in-office of the Council to present its programme at the start of their <a href="Presidency%20of%20the%20Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union">presidency</a>; the obligation on the President of the <a href="European%20Council">European Council</a> to report to Parliament after each of its meetings; the right of MEPs to make requests for legislation and policy to the Commission; and the right to question members of those institutions (e.g. "Commission <a href="Question%20Time">Question Time</a>" every Tuesday). At present, MEPs may ask a question on any topic whatsoever, but in July 2008 MEPs voted to limit questions to those within the EU's mandate and ban offensive or personal questions.

The Parliament also has other powers of general supervision, mainly granted by the <a href="Maastricht%20Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a>. The Parliament has the power to set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over mad cow disease or CIA detention flights—the former led to the creation of the <a href="European%20Medicines%20Agency">European veterinary agency</a>. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to <a href="Court%20of%20Justice%20of%20the%20European%20Communities">court</a> if they break EU law or treaties. Furthermore, it has powers over the appointment of the members of the Court of Auditors and the president and executive board of the <a href="European%20Central%20Bank">European Central Bank</a>. The <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20European%20Central%20Bank">ECB president</a> is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.

The <a href="European%20Ombudsman">European Ombudsman</a> is elected by the Parliament, who deals with public complaints against all institutions. <a href="European%20Citizens%27%20Initiative">Petitions</a> can also be brought forward by any <a href="Citizenship%20of%20the%20European%20Union">EU citizen</a> on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities. The <a href="Committee%20on%20Petitions">Committee on Petitions</a> hears cases, some 1500 each year, sometimes presented by the citizen themselves at the Parliament. While the Parliament attempts to resolve the issue as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if it is necessary to resolve the citizens dispute.

The <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">parliamentarians</a> are known in English as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected every five years by <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal adult suffrage</a> and sit according to political allegiance; about a third are women. Before 1979 they were appointed by their national parliaments. In 2017, an estimated 17 MEPs were not white. Of these, three were black; if the numbers were proportionate to the EU population, then 22 would be black.

Under the Lisbon Treaty, <a href="Apportionment%20in%20the%20European%20Parliament">seats are allocated</a> to each state according to population and the maximum number of members is set at 751 (however, as the President cannot vote while in the chair there will only be 750 voting members at any one time).

The seats are distributed according to "<a href="degressive%20proportionality">degressive proportionality</a>", i.e., the larger the state, the more citizens are represented per MEP. As a result, Maltese and Luxembourgish voters have roughly 10x more influence per voter than citizens of the six large countries.

, Germany (80.9 million inhabitants) has 96 seats (previously 99 seats), i.e. one seat for 843,000 inhabitants. Malta (0.4 million inhabitants) has 6 seats, i.e. one seat for 70,000 inhabitants.

The new system implemented under the Lisbon Treaty, including revising the seating well before elections, was intended to avoid political <a href="horse%20trading%20%28political%29">horse trading</a> when the allocations have to be revised to reflect demographic changes.

Pursuant to this apportionment, the <a href="European%20Parliament%20constituency">constituencies</a> are formed. In six EU member states (Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom), the national territory is divided into a number of constituencies. In the remaining member states, the whole country forms a single constituency. All member states hold elections to the European Parliament using various forms of <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a>.

Due to the delay in ratifying the Lisbon Treaty, the <a href="7th%20European%20Parliament">seventh parliament</a> was elected under the lower Nice Treaty cap. A <a href="Treaties%20of%20the%20European%20Union%23Transitional%20provisions%20protocol">small scale treaty amendment</a> was ratified on 29 November 2011. This amendment brought in transitional provisions to allow the 18 additional MEPs created under the Lisbon Treaty to be elected or appointed before the 2014 election. Under the Lisbon Treaty reforms, Germany was the only state to lose members from 99 to 96. However, these seats were not removed until the 2014 election.

Before 2009, members received the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of €8,484.05 each in 2016, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs are entitled to a pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost. Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and <a href="Diplomatic%20immunity">immunities</a>. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting <a href="Diplomat">foreign representative</a>s. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from <a href="Detention%20%28imprisonment%29">detention</a> and <a href="Criminal%20procedure">legal proceedings</a>. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.

MEPs in Parliament are organised into eight different <a href="parliamentary%20group">parliamentary group</a>s, including thirty non-attached members known as "<a href="non-inscrits">non-inscrits</a>". The two largest groups are the <a href="European%20People%27s%20Party">European People's Party</a> (EPP) and the <a href="Progressive%20Alliance%20of%20Socialists%20and%20Democrats">Socialists & Democrats</a> (S&D). These two groups have dominated the Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats between them. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament. As a result of being broad alliances of national parties, European group parties are very decentralised and hence have more in common with parties in federal states like Germany or the United States than unitary states like the majority of the EU states. Nevertheless, the European groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.

Groups are often based on a single <a href="European%20political%20party">European political party</a> such as the <a href="Party%20of%20European%20Socialists">socialist group</a> (before 2009). However, they can, like the <a href="Alliance%20of%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats%20for%20Europe">liberal group</a>, include more than one European party as well as national parties and independents. For a group to be recognised, it needs 25 MEPs from seven different countries. Once recognised, groups receive financial subsidies from the parliament and guaranteed seats on committees, creating an incentive for the formation of groups. However, some controversy occurred with the establishment of the short-lived <a href="Identity%2C%20Tradition%2C%20Sovereignty">Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty</a> (ITS) due to its ideology; the members of the group were far-right, so there were concerns about public funds going towards such a group. There were attempts to change the rules to block the formation of ITS, but they never came to fruition. The group was, however, blocked from gaining leading positions on committees — traditionally (by agreement, not a rule) shared among all parties. When this group engaged in infighting, leading to the withdrawal of some members, its size fell below the threshold for recognition causing its collapse.

Given that the Parliament does not form the government in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than <a href="majority%20rule">majority rule</a> of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it has been dominated by a <a href="grand%20coalition">grand coalition</a> of the <a href="European%20People%27s%20Party">European People's Party</a> and the <a href="Party%20of%20European%20Socialists">Party of European Socialists</a>. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the <a href="Santer%20Commission%23Budget%20controversy">resignation of the Santer Commission</a>.

When the initial allegations against the Commission emerged, they were directed primarily against <a href="%C3%89dith%20Cresson">Édith Cresson</a> and <a href="Manuel%20Mar%C3%ADn">Manuel Marín</a>, both socialist members. When the parliament was considering refusing to discharge the <a href="Budget%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Community budget</a>, President <a href="Jacques%20Santer">Jacques Santer</a> stated that a no vote would be tantamount to a <a href="vote%20of%20no%20confidence">vote of no confidence</a>. The Socialist group supported the Commission and saw the issue as an attempt by the EPP to discredit their party ahead of the 1999 elections. Socialist leader, <a href="Pauline%20Green">Pauline Green</a> MEP, attempted a vote of confidence and the EPP put forward counter motions. During this period the two parties took on similar roles to a government-<a href="Opposition%20%28parliamentary%29">opposition</a> dynamic, with the Socialists supporting the executive and EPP renouncing its previous coalition support and voting it down. Politicisation such as this has been increasing, in 2007 Simon Hix of the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a> noted that:
During the fifth term, 1999 to 2004, there was a break in the grand coalition resulting in a centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties. This was reflected in the Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and Socialists. In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament.

Elections have taken place, directly in every member state, every five years since 1979. there have been eight elections. When a nation joins mid-term, a by-election will be held to elect their representatives. This has happened six times, most recently when Croatia joined in 2013. Elections take place across four days according to local custom and, apart from having to be proportional, the <a href="electoral%20system">electoral system</a> is chosen by the member state. This includes allocation of <a href="European%20Parliament%20constituency">sub-national constituencies</a>; while most members have a national list, some, like the UK and France, divide their allocation between regions. Seats are allocated to member states according to their population, since 2014 with no state having more than 96, but no fewer than 6, to maintain proportionality.

The most recent Union-wide elections to the European Parliament were the <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%202014">European elections of 2014</a>, held from 22 to 25 May 2014. They were the largest simultaneous transnational elections ever held anywhere in the world.
The eighth term of Parliament started on 1 July 2014.

The proportion of MEPs elected in 2009 who were female was 35%; in 1979 it was just 16.5%.

There have been a number of proposals designed to attract greater public attention to the elections. One such innovation in the 2014 elections was that the <a href="European%20political%20party">pan-European political parties</a> fielded "candidates" for <a href="President%20of%20the%20European%20Commission">president</a> of the <a href="European%20Commission">Commission</a>, the so-called "Spitzenkandidaten" (German, "leading candidates" or "top candidates"). However, European Union governance is based on a mixture of intergovernmental and supranational features: the President of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council, representing the governments of the member states, and there is no obligation for them to nominate the successful "candidate". The Lisbon Treaty merely states that they should take account of the results of the elections when choosing whom to nominate. The so-called "Spitzenkandidaten" were <a href="Jean-Claude%20Juncker">Jean-Claude Juncker</a> for the <a href="European%20People%27s%20Party">European People's Party</a>, <a href="Martin%20Schulz">Martin Schulz</a> for the <a href="Party%20of%20European%20Socialists">Party of European Socialists</a>, <a href="Guy%20Verhofstadt">Guy Verhofstadt</a> for the <a href="Alliance%20of%20Liberals%20and%20Democrats%20for%20Europe%20Party">Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party</a>, <a href="Ska%20Keller">Ska Keller</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Bov%C3%A9">José Bové</a> jointly for the <a href="European%20Green%20Party">European Green Party</a> and <a href="Alexis%20Tsipras">Alexis Tsipras</a> for the <a href="Party%20of%20the%20European%20Left">Party of the European Left</a>.

Turnout has dropped consistently every year since the first election, and from 1999 it has been below 50%. In 2007 both <a href="European%20Parliament%20election%2C%202007">Bulgaria and Romania elected their MEPs</a> in by-elections, having joined at the beginning of 2007. The Bulgarian and Romanian elections saw two of the lowest turnouts for European elections, just 28.6% and 28.3% respectively.

In England, Scotland and Wales, EP elections were originally held for a constituency MEP on a first-past-the-post basis. In 1999 the system was changed to a form of <a href="proportional%20representation">PR</a> where a large group of candidates would stand for a post within a very large regional constituency. One could vote for a party, but not a candidate (unless that party had a single candidate).

Each year the activities of the Parliament cycle between committee weeks where reports are discussed in committees and interparliamentary delegations meet, political group weeks for members to discuss work within their political groups and session weeks where members spend 3½ days in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a> for part-sessions. In addition six 2-day part-sessions are organised in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> throughout the year. Four weeks are allocated as constituency week to allow members to do exclusively constituency work. Finally there are no meetings planned during the summer weeks. The Parliament has the power to meet without being convened by another authority. Its meetings are partly controlled by the treaties but are otherwise up to Parliament according to its own "Rules of Procedure" (the regulations governing the parliament).

During sessions, members may speak after being called on by the President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due to the need for translation, and the politics of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the <a href="Westminster%20system">Westminster system</a>. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the "<a href="Official%20Journal%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Official Journal of the European Union</a>" and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.

Members are arranged in a <a href="Hemicycle%20%28chamber%29">hemicycle</a> according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically) who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are taken up by the Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences. The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although the design is mainly based on a semicircle, the opposite ends of the spectrum do still face each other. With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black <a href="Tailcoat">tails</a> and wearing a silver chain, and are <a href="EU%20Concours">recruited</a> in the same manner as the <a href="European%20Civil%20Service">European civil service</a>. The President is allocated a personal usher.

The President is essentially the <a href="Speaker%20%28politics%29">speaker</a> of the Parliament and presides over the plenary when it is in session. The President's signature is required for all acts adopted by co-decision, including the EU budget. The President is also responsible for representing the Parliament externally, including in legal matters, and for the application of the rules of procedure. He or she is elected for two-and-a-half-year terms, meaning two elections per parliamentary term. The President is currently <a href="Antonio%20Tajani">Antonio Tajani</a> MEP of the EPP.

In most countries, the protocol of the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> comes before all others; however, in the EU the Parliament is listed as the first institution, and hence the protocol of its president comes before any other European, or national, protocol. The gifts given to numerous visiting dignitaries depend upon the President. President <a href="Josep%20Borrell">Josep Borrell</a> MEP of Spain gave his counterparts a crystal cup created by an artist from Barcelona who had engraved upon it parts of the <a href="Charter%20of%20Fundamental%20Rights%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Charter of Fundamental Rights</a> among other things.

A number of notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was <a href="Paul-Henri%20Spaak">Paul-Henri Spaak</a> MEP, one of the <a href="Founding%20fathers%20of%20the%20European%20Union">founding fathers of the Union</a>. Other founding fathers include <a href="Alcide%20de%20Gasperi">Alcide de Gasperi</a> MEP and <a href="Robert%20Schuman">Robert Schuman</a> MEP. The two female Presidents were <a href="Simone%20Veil">Simone Veil</a> MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament) and <a href="Nicole%20Fontaine">Nicole Fontaine</a> MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen. The previous president, <a href="Jerzy%20Buzek">Jerzy Buzek</a> was the first <a href="East-Central%20Europe">East-Central Europe</a>an to lead an EU institution, a former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Poland">Prime Minister of Poland</a> who rose out of the <a href="Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29">Solidarity</a> movement in Poland that helped overthrow communism in the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>.

During the election of a President, the previous President (or, if unable to, one of the previous Vice-Presidents) presides over the chamber. Prior to 2009, the <a href="President%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament%23Oldest%20member">oldest member</a> fulfilled this role but the rule was changed to prevent far-right French MEP <a href="Jean-Marie%20Le%20Pen">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a> taking the chair.

Below the President, there are 14 <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">Vice-Presidents</a> who chair debates when the President is not in the chamber. There are a number of other bodies and posts responsible for the running of parliament besides these speakers. The two main bodies are the <a href="Bureau%20%28European%20Parliament%29">Bureau</a>, which is responsible for budgetary and administration issues, and the <a href="Conference%20of%20Presidents">Conference of Presidents</a> which is a governing body composed of the presidents of each of the parliament's political groups. Looking after the financial and administrative interests of members are five <a href="Quaestor%20%28European%20Parliament%29">Quaestors</a>.

, the European Parliament budget was EUR 1.756 billion. A 2008 report on the Parliament's finances highlighted certain overspending and miss-payments. Despite some MEPs calling for the report to be published, Parliamentary authorities had refused until an MEP broke confidentiality and leaked it.

The Parliament has 20 <a href="Standing%20Committee">Standing Committee</a>s consisting of 25 to 73 MEPs each (reflecting the political make-up of the whole Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to be presented to the plenary. The <a href="rapporteur">rapporteur</a>s for a committee are supposed to present the view of the committee, although notably this has not always been the case. In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the <a href="Committee%20on%20Budgetary%20Control">Budgetary Control Committee's</a> narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.

Committees can also set up sub-committees (e.g. the <a href="Subcommittee%20on%20Human%20Rights">Subcommittee on Human Rights</a>) and temporary committees to deal with a specific topic (e.g. on <a href="extraordinary%20rendition">extraordinary rendition</a>). The chairs of the Committees co-ordinate their work through the "<a href="Committees%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament%23Conference%20of%20Committee%20Chairs">Conference of Committee Chairmen</a>". When co-decision was introduced it increased the Parliament's powers in a number of areas, but most notably those covered by the <a href="Committee%20on%20the%20Environment%2C%20Public%20Health%20and%20Food%20Safety">Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety</a>. Previously this committee was considered by MEPs as a "<a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a> committee"; however, as it gained a new importance, it became more professional and rigorous, attracting increasing attention to its work.
The nature of the committees differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison to those of the <a href="United%20States%20Congressional%20committee">United States Congress</a>, the European Parliament's committees are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at the disposal of the whole Parliament when needed.

<a href="European%20Parliament%20Delegations">Delegations of the Parliament</a> are formed in a similar manner and are responsible for relations with Parliaments outside the EU. There are 34 delegations made up of around 15 MEPs, chairpersons of the delegations also cooperate in a conference like the committee chairs do. They include "Interparliamentary delegations" (maintain relations with Parliament outside the EU), "joint parliamentary committees" (maintaining relations with parliaments of states which are candidates or associates of the EU), the delegation to the <a href="ACP%20EU%20Joint%20Parliamentary%20Assembly">ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly</a> and the delegation to the <a href="Euro-Mediterranean%20Parliamentary%20Assembly">Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly</a>. MEPs also participate in other international activities such as the <a href="Euro-Latin%20American%20Parliamentary%20Assembly">Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly</a>, the <a href="Transatlantic%20Legislators%27%20Dialogue">Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue</a> and through <a href="Election%20monitoring">election observation</a> in third countries.

The <a href="Intergroups%20in%20the%20European%20Parliament">Intergroups in the European Parliament</a> are informal fora which gather MEPs from various political groups around any topic. They do not express the view of the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s. They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests. Also Intergroups are established or renewed at the beginning of each legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups whose support is limited to a specific number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S&D political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).

Speakers in the European Parliament are entitled to speak in any of the 24 official <a href="languages%20of%20the%20European%20Union">languages of the European Union</a>, ranging from French and German to <a href="Maltese%20language">Maltese</a> and Irish. Simultaneous interpreting is offered in all plenary sessions, and all final texts of legislation are translated. With twenty-four languages, the European Parliament is the most multilingual parliament in the world and the biggest employer of interpreters in the world (employing 350 full-time and 400 free-lancers when there is higher demand). Citizens may also address the Parliament in <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a>, <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a>, <a href="Valencian">Valencian</a> and <a href="Galician%20language">Galician</a>.

Usually a language is translated from a foreign tongue into a translator's native tongue. Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter's native tongue (the "retour" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters ("relay" interpreting) —for example, when interpreting out of <a href="Estonian%20language">Estonian</a> into <a href="Maltese%20language">Maltese</a>. Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use profanities, jokes and word play or speak too fast.

While some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by <a href="Alexander%20Stubb">Alexander Stubb</a> MEP highlighted that by only using English, French and German costs could be reduced from <a href="Euro">€</a>118,000 per day (for 21 languages then—<a href="Romanian%20language">Romanian</a>, <a href="Bulgarian%20language">Bulgarian</a> and <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a> having not yet been included) to €8,900 per day. Some see the ideal single language as being English due to its widespread usage, although there has been a small-scale campaign to make French the reference language for all legal texts, on the basis of an argument that it is more clear and precise for legal purposes.

Because the proceedings are translated into all of the official EU languages, they have been used to make a multilingual <a href="Text%20corpus">corpus</a> known as <a href="Europarl%20corpus">Europarl</a>. It is widely used to train <a href="statistical%20machine%20translation">statistical machine translation</a> systems.

According to the European Parliament website, the annual parliament budget for 2016 was €1.838 billion. The main cost categories were:


According to a European Parliament study prepared in 2013, the Strasbourg seat costs an extra €103 million over maintaining a single location and according to the Court of Auditors an additional €5 million is related to travel expenses caused by having two seats.

As a comparison, the German lower house of parliament (<a href="Bundestag">Bundestag</a>) is estimated to cost €517 million in total for 2018, for a parliament with 709 members. The British <a href="House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> reported total annual costs in 2016-2017 of £249 million (€279 million). It had 650 seats.

According to "The Economist", the European Parliament costs more than the British, French and German parliaments combined. A quarter of the costs is estimated to be related to translation and interpretation costs (c. €460 million) and the double seats are estimated to add an additional €180 million a year. For a like-for-like comparison, these two cost blocks can be excluded. The resulting costs of c. €1.2 billion a year are still more than double the German Bundestag's costs or more than four times the costs of the British House of Commons.

On 2 July 2018, MEPs rejected proposals to tighten the rules around the General Expenditure Allowance (GEA), which "is a controversial €4,416 per month payment that MEPs are given to cover office and other expenses, but they are not required to provide any evidence of how the money is spent".

The Parliament is based in three different cities with numerous buildings. A protocol attached to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amsterdam">Treaty of Amsterdam</a> requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a> (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. Luxembourg City hosts the <a href="Secretariat%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">Secretariat of the European Parliament</a>. The European Parliament is one of at least two assemblies in the world with more than one meeting place (another being the <a href="Tynwald">parliament of the Isle of Man, Tynwald</a>) and one of the few that does not have the power to decide its own location.

The Strasbourg seat is seen as a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany, the Strasbourg region having been fought over by the two countries in the past. However, the cost and inconvenience of having two seats is questioned. While Strasbourg is the official seat, and sits alongside the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a>, <a href="Brussels%20and%20the%20European%20Union">Brussels is home to nearly all other major EU institutions</a>, with the majority of Parliament's work being carried out there. Critics have described the two-seat arrangement as a "travelling circus", and there is a strong movement to establish Brussels as the sole seat. This is because the other political institutions (the Commission, Council and European Council) are located there, and hence Brussels is treated as the '<a href="Capital%20city">capital</a>' of the EU. This movement has received strong backing from numerous figures, including the Commission First-Vice President who stated that "something that was once a very positive symbol of the EU reuniting France and Germany has now become a negative symbol—of wasting money, bureaucracy and the insanity of the Brussels institutions". The <a href="European%20Green%20Party">Green Party</a> has also noted the environmental cost in a study led by <a href="Jean%20Lambert">Jean Lambert</a> MEP and <a href="Caroline%20Lucas">Caroline Lucas</a> MEP; in addition to the extra 200 million euro spent on the extra seat, there are over 20,268 tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union. The campaign is further backed by a million-strong online petition started by <a href="Cecilia%20Malmstr%C3%B6m">Cecilia Malmström</a> MEP. In August 2014, an assessment by the European Court of Auditors calculated that relocating the Strasbourg seat of the European Parliament to Brussels would save €113.8 million per year. In 2006, there were allegations of irregularities in the charges made by the city of Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament rented, thus further harming the case for the Strasbourg seat.

Most MEPs prefer Brussels as a single base. A poll of MEPs found 89% of the respondents wanting a single seat, and 81% preferring Brussels. Another, more academic, survey found 68% support. In July 2011, an absolute majority of MEPs voted in favour of a single seat. In early 2011, the Parliament voted to scrap one of the Strasbourg sessions by holding two within a single week. The <a href="Roland%20Ries">mayor of Strasbourg</a> officially reacted by stating "we will counter-attack by upturning the adversary's strength to our own profit, as a <a href="judo">judo</a>ka would do." However, as Parliament's seat is now fixed by the treaties, it can only be changed by the Council acting unanimously, meaning that France could veto any move. The former <a href="French%20President">French President</a> <a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> has stated that the Strasbourg seat is "non-negotiable", and that France has no intention of surrendering the only EU Institution on French soil. Given France's declared intention to veto any relocation to Brussels, some MEPs have advocated <a href="civil%20disobedience">civil disobedience</a> by refusing to take part in the monthly exodus to Strasbourg.

Over the last few years, European institutions have committed to promoting transparency, openness, and the availability of information about their work. In particular, transparency is regarded as pivotal to the action of European institutions and a general principle of EU law, to be applied to the activities of EU institutions in order to strengthen the Union's democratic foundation. The general principles of openness and transparency are reaffirmed in the articles 8 A, point 3 and 10.3 of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lisbon">Treaty of Lisbon</a> and the <a href="Maastricht%20Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a> respectively, stating that "every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen". Furthermore, both treaties acknowledge the value of dialogue between citizens, representative associations, civil society, and European institutions.

Article 17 of the <a href="Treaty%20on%20the%20Functioning%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union</a> (TFEU) lays the juridical foundation for an open, transparent dialogue between European institutions and churches, religious associations, and non-confessional and philosophical organisations. In July 2014, in the beginning of the 8th term, then President of the European Parliament <a href="Martin%20Schulz">Martin Schulz</a> tasked <a href="Antonio%20Tajani">Antonio Tajani</a>, then Vice-President, with implementing the dialogue with the religious and confessional organisations included in article 17. In this framework, the European Parliament hosts high-level conferences on inter-religious dialogue, also with focus on current issues and in relation with parliamentary works.

The chair of European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was established in 1987 by initiative of British MEP Charles <a href="Henry%20Plumb">Henry Plumb</a>, with the goal of helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by <a href="Mairead%20McGuinness">Mairead McGuinness</a> (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.

The <a href="European%20Parliamentary%20Research%20Service">European Parliamentary Research Service</a> (EPRS) is the European Parliament's in-house research department and think tank. It provides <a href="Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">Members of the European Parliament</a> – and, where appropriate, <a href="Committees%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">parliamentary committees</a> – with independent, objective and authoritative analysis of, and research on, policy issues relating to the European Union, in order to assist them in their parliamentary work. It is also designed to increase Members' and EP committees' capacity to scrutinise and oversee the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> and other <a href="Bodies%20of%20the%20European%20Union">EU executive bodies</a>.

EPRS aims to provide a comprehensive range of products and services, backed by specialist internal expertise and knowledge sources in all policy fields, so empowering Members and committees through knowledge and contributing to the Parliament's effectiveness and influence as an institution. In undertaking this work, the EPRS supports and promotes parliamentary outreach to the wider public, including dialogue with relevant stakeholders in the <a href="European%20Union">EU</a>’s system of multi-level governance. All publications by EPRS are publicly available on the EP Think Tank platform.

The European Parliament periodically commissions opinion polls and studies on public opinion trends in Member States to survey perceptions and expectations of citizens about its work and the overall activities of the European Union. Topics include citizens' perception of the European Parliament's role, their knowledge of the institution, their sense of belonging in the European Union, opinions on European elections and European integration, identity, citizenship, political values, but also on current issues such as climate change, current economy and politics, etc.. <a href="Eurobarometer">Eurobarometer</a> analyses seek to provide an overall picture of national situations, regional specificities, socio-demographic cleavages, and historical trends.

Annually, the European Parliament awards four prizes to individuals and organisations that distinguished themselves in the areas of human rights, film, youth projects, and European participation and citizenship.

With the <a href="Sakharov%20Prize%20for%20Freedom%20of%20Thought">Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought</a>, created in 1998, the European Parliament supports human rights by awarding individuals that contribute to promoting human rights worldwide, thus raising awareness on human rights violations. Priorities include: protection of human rights and fundamental liberties, with particular focus on freedom of expression; protection of minority rights; compliance with international law; and development of democracy and authentic rule of law.

The <a href="European%20Charlemagne%20Youth%20Prize">European Charlemagne Youth Prize</a> seeks to encourage youth participation in the European integration process. It is awarded by the European Parliament and the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen to youth projects aimed at nurturing common European identity and European citizenship.

The <a href="European%20Citizens%27%20Prize">European Citizens' Prize</a> is awarded by the European Parliament to activities and actions carried out by citizens and associations to promote integration between the citizens of EU member states and transnational cooperation projects in the EU.

Since 2007, the <a href="LUX%20Prize">LUX Prize</a> is awarded by the European Parliament to films dealing with current topics of public European interest that encourage reflection on Europe and its future. Over time, the Lux Prize has become a prestigious cinema award which supports European film and production also outside the EU.

Emma Goldman

Emma Goldman (, 1869May 14, 1940) was an <a href="anarchism">anarchist</a> political activist and writer. She played a pivotal role in the development of <a href="anarchist%20political%20philosophy">anarchist political philosophy</a> in North America and Europe in the first half of the 20th century.

Born in Kovno, <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> (now <a href="Kaunas">Kaunas</a>, <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>) to a Jewish family, Goldman emigrated to the United States in 1885, although she never became a citizen. Attracted to anarchism after the <a href="Haymarket%20affair">Haymarket affair</a>, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer <a href="Alexander%20Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a>, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier <a href="Henry%20Clay%20Frick">Henry Clay Frick</a> as an act of <a href="propaganda%20of%20the%20deed">propaganda of the deed</a>. Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892, and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for "inciting to riot" and illegally distributing information about <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a>. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal "<a href="Mother%20Earth%20%28magazine%29">Mother Earth</a>".

In 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to "induce persons not to register" for the <a href="conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">newly instated draft</a>. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with 248 others—and deported to <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Russia</a>. Initially supportive of that country's <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> that brought the <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> to power, Goldman changed her opinion in the wake of the <a href="Kronstadt%20rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a>; she denounced the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> for its violent repression of independent voices. She left the Soviet Union and in 1923 published a book about her experiences, "<a href="My%20Disillusionment%20in%20Russia">My Disillusionment in Russia</a>". While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called "<a href="Living%20My%20Life">Living My Life</a>". It was published in two volumes, in 1931 and 1935. After the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, Goldman traveled to Spain to support the <a href="Spanish%20Revolution%20of%201936">anarchist revolution</a> there. She died in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, Canada, on May 14, 1940, aged 70.

During her life, Goldman was lionized as a <a href="freethought">freethinking</a> "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by detractors as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including <a href="prison%20abolition%20movement">prisons</a>, <a href="atheism">atheism</a>, <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>, <a href="militarism">militarism</a>, <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a>, marriage, <a href="free%20love">free love</a>, and <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a>. Although she distanced herself from <a href="first-wave%20feminism">first-wave feminism</a> and its efforts toward <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>, she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. After decades of obscurity, Goldman gained iconic status in the 1970s by a revival of interest in her life, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest.

Emma Goldman was born into an <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox Jewish</a> family in Kovno in the Russian Empire, which is now known as <a href="Kaunas">Kaunas</a> in <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>. Goldman's mother Taube Bienowitch had been married before to a man with whom she had two daughters—Helena in 1860 and Lena in 1862. When her first husband died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, Taube was devastated. Goldman later wrote: "Whatever love she had had died with the young man to whom she had been married at the age of fifteen."

Taube's second <a href="arranged%20marriage">marriage was arranged</a> by her family and, as Goldman puts it, "mismated from the first". Her second husband, Abraham Goldman, invested Taube's inheritance in a business that quickly failed. The ensuing hardship, combined with the emotional distance of husband and wife, made the household a tense place for the children. When Taube became pregnant, Abraham hoped desperately for a son; a daughter, he believed, would be one more sign of failure. They eventually had three sons, but their first child was Emma.

Emma Goldman was born on June 27, 1869. Her father used violence to punish his children, beating them when they disobeyed him. He used a whip on Emma, the most rebellious of them. Her mother provided scarce comfort, rarely calling on Abraham to tone down his beatings. Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper was at least partly a result of sexual frustration.

Goldman's relationships with her elder half-sisters, Helena and Lena, were a study in contrasts. Helena, the oldest, provided the comfort the children lacked from their mother; she filled Goldman's childhood with "whatever joy it had". Lena, however, was distant and uncharitable. The three sisters were joined by brothers Louis (who died at the age of six), Herman (born in 1872), and Moishe (born in 1879).

When Emma was a young girl, the Goldman family moved to the village of <a href="Papil%C4%97">Papilė</a>, where her father ran an inn. While her sisters worked, she became friends with a servant named Petrushka, who excited her "first erotic sensations". Later in Papilė she witnessed a peasant being whipped with a <a href="knout">knout</a> in the street. This event traumatized her and contributed to her lifelong distaste for violent authority.

At the age of seven, Goldman moved with her family to the Prussian city of <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a> (then part of the German Empire), and she was enrolled in a "<a href="Realschule">Realschule</a>". One teacher punished disobedient students—targeting Goldman in particular—by beating their hands with a ruler. Another teacher tried to molest his female students and was fired when Goldman fought back. She found a sympathetic mentor in her German-language teacher, who loaned her books and took her to an opera. A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a <a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">gymnasium</a>, but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of good behavior and she was unable to attend.

The family moved to the Russian capital of <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, where her father opened one unsuccessful store after another. Their poverty forced the children to work, and Goldman took an assortment of jobs, including one in a <a href="corset">corset</a> shop. As a teenager Goldman begged her father to allow her to return to school, but instead he threw her French book into the fire and shouted: "Girls do not have to learn much! All a Jewish daughter needs to know is how to prepare <a href="gefilte%20fish">gefilte fish</a>, cut noodles fine, and give the man plenty of children."

Goldman pursued an independent education <a href="autodidact">on her own</a>, however, and soon began to study the political turmoil around her, particularly the <a href="Nihilist%20movement">Nihilists</a> responsible for assassinating <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a>. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read <a href="Nikolai%20Chernyshevsky">Nikolai Chernyshevsky</a>'s novel, "<a href="What%20Is%20to%20Be%20Done%3F%20%28novel%29">What Is to Be Done?</a>" (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera. She adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing <a href="cooperative">cooperative</a>. The book enthralled Goldman and remained a source of inspiration throughout her life.

Her father, meanwhile, continued to insist on a domestic future for her, and he tried to arrange for her to be married at the age of fifteen. They fought about the issue constantly; he complained that she was becoming a "loose" woman, and she insisted that she would marry for love alone. At the corset shop, she was forced to fend off unwelcome advances from Russian officers and other men. One persistent suitor took her into a hotel room and committed what Goldman described as "violent contact"; two biographers call it rape. She was stunned by the experience, overcome by "shock at the discovery that the contact between man and woman could be so brutal and painful." Goldman felt that the encounter forever soured her interactions with men.

In 1885, her sister Helena made plans to move to New York in the United States to join her sister Lena and her husband. Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it. Despite Helena's offer to pay for the trip, Abraham turned a deaf ear to their pleas. Desperate, Goldman threatened to throw herself into the <a href="Neva%20River">Neva River</a> if she could not go. Their father finally agreed. On December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York City's <a href="Castle%20Garden">Castle Garden</a>, the entry for immigrants.

They settled upstate, living in the <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester</a> home which Lena had made with her husband Samuel. Fleeing the rising <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a> of Saint Petersburg, their parents and brothers joined them a year later. Goldman began working as a <a href="seamstress">seamstress</a>, sewing overcoats for more than ten hours a day, earning two and a half dollars a week. She asked for a raise and was denied; she quit and took work at a smaller shop nearby.

At her new job, Goldman met a fellow worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared her love for books, dancing, and traveling, as well as her frustration with the monotony of factory work. After four months, they married in February 1887. Once he moved in with Goldman's family, however, their relationship faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious. She, meanwhile, was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her—particularly the aftermath of executions related to the 1886 <a href="Haymarket%20affair">Haymarket affair</a> in Chicago and the <a href="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> political philosophy of <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a>.

Less than a year after the wedding, the couple were divorced; Kershner begged Goldman to return and threatened to poison himself if she did not. They reunited, but after three months she left once again. Her parents considered her behavior "loose" and refused to allow Goldman into their home. Carrying her sewing machine in one hand and a bag with five dollars in the other, she left Rochester and headed southeast to New York City.

On her first day in the city, Goldman met two men who greatly changed her life. At Sachs's Café, a gathering place for radicals, she was introduced to <a href="Alexander%20Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a>, an anarchist who invited her to a public speech that evening. They went to hear <a href="Johann%20Most">Johann Most</a>, editor of a radical publication called "<a href="Freiheit%20%281879%29">Freiheit</a>" and an advocate of "<a href="propaganda%20of%20the%20deed">propaganda of the deed</a>"—the use of violence to instigate change. She was impressed by his fiery oration, and Most took her under his wing, training her in methods of public speaking. He encouraged her vigorously, telling her that she was "to take my place when I am gone." One of her first public talks in support of "the Cause" was in Rochester. After convincing Helena not to tell their parents of her speech, Goldman found her mind a blank once on stage. She later wrote, suddenly:
Excited by the experience, Goldman refined her public persona during subsequent engagements. Quickly, however, she found herself arguing with Most over her independence. After a momentous speech in <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland</a>, she felt as though she had become "a parrot repeating Most's views" and resolved to express herself on the stage. When she returned to New York, Most became furious and told her: "Who is not with me is against me!" She left "Freiheit" and joined another publication, "<a href="Die%20Autonomie">Die Autonomie</a>".

Meanwhile, Goldman had begun a friendship with Berkman, whom she affectionately called Sasha. Before long they became lovers and moved into a communal apartment with his cousin <a href="Modest%20Stein">Modest "Fedya" Stein</a> and Goldman's friend, Helen Minkin, on <a href="42nd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">42nd Street</a>. Although their relationship had numerous difficulties, Goldman and Berkman would share a close bond for decades, united by their anarchist principles and commitment to personal equality.
In 1892, Goldman joined with Berkman and Stein in opening an ice cream shop in <a href="Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester, Massachusetts</a>. After a few months of operating the shop, however, Goldman and Berkman were diverted by becoming involved in the <a href="Homestead%20Strike">Homestead Strike</a> in western Pennsylvania near <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>.

Berkman and Goldman came together through the <a href="Homestead%20Strike">Homestead Strike</a>. In June 1892, a steel plant in <a href="Homestead%2C%20Pennsylvania">Homestead, Pennsylvania</a> owned by <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a> became the focus of national attention when talks between the <a href="Carnegie%20Steel%20Company">Carnegie Steel Company</a> and the <a href="Amalgamated%20Association%20of%20Iron%20and%20Steel%20Workers">Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers</a> (AA) broke down. The factory's manager was <a href="Henry%20Clay%20Frick">Henry Clay Frick</a>, a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and locked out the workers, who immediately went on strike. <a href="Strikebreaker">Strikebreaker</a>s were brought in and the company hired <a href="Pinkerton%20National%20Detective%20Agency">Pinkerton guards</a> to protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.

When a majority of the nation's newspapers expressed support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman chose to carry out the assassination, and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he went to jail. He would be in charge of "the deed"; she of the associated propaganda. Berkman tried and failed to make a bomb, then set off for Pittsburgh to buy a gun and a suit of decent clothes.

Goldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution. Remembering the character of Sonya in <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>'s novel "<a href="Crime%20and%20Punishment">Crime and Punishment</a>" (1866), she mused: "She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters...Sensitive Sonya could sell her body; why not I?" Once on the street, Goldman caught the eye of a man who took her into a saloon, bought her a beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have "the knack," and told her to quit the business. She was "too astounded for speech". She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and asked her for fifteen dollars.

On July 23, Berkman gained access to Frick's office while carrying a concealed handgun; he shot Frick three times, and stabbed him in the leg. A group of workers—far from joining in his "attentat"—beat Berkman unconscious, and he was carried away by the police. Berkman was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman suffered during his long absence.

Convinced Goldman was involved in the plot, police raided her apartment. Although they found no evidence, they pressured her landlord into evicting her. Worse, the "attentat" had failed to rouse the masses: workers and anarchists alike condemned Berkman's action. Johann Most, their former mentor, lashed out at Berkman and the assassination attempt. Furious at these attacks, Goldman brought a toy horsewhip to a public lecture and demanded, onstage, that Most explain his betrayal. He dismissed her, whereupon she struck him with the whip, broke it on her knee, and hurled the pieces at him. She later regretted her assault, confiding to a friend: "At the age of twenty-three, one does not reason."

When the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a> struck in the following year, the United States suffered one of its worst economic crises. By year's end, the unemployment rate was higher than 20%, and "hunger demonstrations" sometimes gave way to riots. Goldman began speaking to crowds of frustrated men and women in New York City. On August 21, she spoke to a crowd of nearly 3,000 people in <a href="Union%20Square%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Union Square</a>, where she encouraged unemployed workers to take immediate action. Her exact words are unclear: undercover agents insist she ordered the crowd to "take everything ... by force". But Goldman later recounted this message: "Well then, demonstrate before the palaces of the rich; demand work. If they do not give you work, demand bread. If they deny you both, take bread." Later in court, Detective-Sergeant Charles Jacobs offered yet another version of her speech.

A week later Goldman was arrested in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and returned to New York City for trial, charged with "inciting to riot". During the train ride, Jacobs offered to drop the charges against her if she would inform on other radicals in the area. She responded by throwing a glass of ice water in his face. As she awaited trial, Goldman was visited by <a href="Nellie%20Bly">Nellie Bly</a>, a reporter for the "<a href="New%20York%20World">New York World</a>." She spent two hours talking to Goldman, and wrote a positive article about the woman she described as a "modern <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a>."

Despite this positive publicity, the jury was persuaded by Jacobs' testimony and frightened by Goldman's politics. The assistant District Attorney questioned Goldman about her anarchism, as well as her atheism; the judge spoke of her as "a dangerous woman". She was sentenced to one year in the <a href="Roosevelt%20Island">Blackwell's Island</a> Penitentiary. Once inside she suffered an attack of <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a> and was sent to the infirmary; there she befriended a visiting doctor and began studying medicine. She also read dozens of books, including works by the American activist-writers <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> and <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>; novelist <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>; poet <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>, and philosopher <a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>. When Goldman was released after ten months, a raucous crowd of nearly 3,000 people greeted her at the <a href="Bowery%20Theatre">Thalia Theater</a> in New York City. She soon became swamped with requests for interviews and lectures.

To make money, Goldman decided to pursue the medical work she had studied in prison. However, her preferred fields of specialization—<a href="midwifery">midwifery</a> and <a href="massage">massage</a>—were not available to nursing students in the US. She sailed to Europe, lecturing in London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. She met with renowned anarchists such as <a href="Errico%20Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a>, <a href="Louise%20Michel">Louise Michel</a>, and <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>. In <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, she received two diplomas for midwifery and put them immediately to use back in the US.

Alternating between lectures and midwifery, Goldman conducted the first cross-country tour by an anarchist speaker. In November 1899 she returned to Europe to speak, where she met the Czech anarchist <a href="Hippolyte%20Havel">Hippolyte Havel</a> in London. They went together to France and helped organize the 1900 International Anarchist Congress on the outskirts of Paris. Afterward Havel immigrated to the United States, traveling with her to Chicago. They shared a residence there with friends of Goldman.

On September 6, 1901, <a href="Leon%20Czolgosz">Leon Czolgosz</a>, an unemployed factory worker and registered Republican with a history of mental illness, shot US President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> twice during a public speaking event in <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>. McKinley was hit in the breastbone and stomach, and died eight days later. Czolgosz was arrested, and interrogated around the clock. During interrogation he claimed to be an anarchist and said he had been inspired to act after attending a speech by Goldman. The authorities used this as a pretext to charge Goldman with planning McKinley's assassination. They tracked her to a residence in Chicago she shared with Hippolyte Havel, who had come to the US; as well as with Mary and <a href="Abe%20Isaak">Abe Isaak</a>, an anarchist couple and their family. Goldman was arrested, along with Isaak, Havel, and ten other anarchists.
Earlier, Czolgosz had tried but failed to become friends with Goldman and her companions. During a talk in Cleveland, Czolgosz had approached Goldman and asked her advice on which books he should read. In July 1901, he had appeared at the Isaak house, asking a series of unusual questions. They assumed he was an infiltrator, like a number of police agents sent to spy on radical groups. They had remained distant from him, and Abe Isaak sent a notice to associates warning of "another spy".

Although Czolgosz repeatedly denied Goldman's involvement, the police held her in close custody, subjecting her to what she called the "<a href="Third%20degree%20%28interrogation%29">third degree</a>". She explained her housemates' distrust of Czolgosz, and the police finally recognized that she had not had any significant contact with the attacker. No evidence was found linking Goldman to the attack, and she was released after two weeks of detention. Before McKinley died, Goldman offered to provide nursing care, referring to him as "merely a human being". Czolgosz, despite considerable evidence of <a href="mental%20illness">mental illness</a>, was convicted of murder and executed.

Throughout her detention and after her release, Goldman steadfastly refused to condemn Czolgosz's actions, standing virtually alone in doing so. Friends and supporters—including Berkman—urged her to quit his cause. But Goldman defended Czolgosz as a "supersensitive being" and chastised other anarchists for abandoning him. She was vilified in the press as the "high priestess of anarchy", while many newspapers declared the anarchist movement responsible for the murder. In the wake of these events, <a href="socialism">socialism</a> gained support over anarchism among US radicals. McKinley's successor, <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, declared his intent to crack down "not only against anarchists, but against all active and passive sympathizers with anarchists".

After Czolgosz was executed, Goldman withdrew from the world. Scorned by her fellow anarchists, vilified by the press, and separated from her love, Berkman, she retreated into anonymity and nursing. "It was bitter and hard to face life anew," she wrote later.

Using the name E. G. Smith, she left public life and took on a series of private nursing jobs. When the US Congress passed the <a href="Anarchist%20Exclusion%20Act">Anarchist Exclusion Act</a> (1903), however, a new wave of activism rose to oppose it, and Goldman was pulled back into the movement. A coalition of people and organizations across the <a href="left-wing%20politics">left</a> end of the political spectrum opposed the law on grounds that it violated <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>, and she had the nation's ear once again.

After an English anarchist named <a href="John%20Turner%20%28anarchist%29">John Turner</a> was arrested under the Anarchist Exclusion Act and threatened with deportation, Goldman joined forces with the <a href="Free%20Speech%20League">Free Speech League</a> to champion his cause. The league enlisted the aid of noted attorneys <a href="Clarence%20Darrow">Clarence Darrow</a> and <a href="Edgar%20Lee%20Masters">Edgar Lee Masters</a>, who took Turner's case to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">US Supreme Court</a>. Although Turner and the League lost, Goldman considered it a victory of propaganda. She had returned to anarchist activism, but it was taking its toll on her. "I never felt so weighed down," she wrote to Berkman. "I fear I am forever doomed to remain public property and to have my life worn out through the care for the lives of others."

In 1906, Goldman decided to start a publication, "a place of expression for the young idealists in arts and letters". "<a href="Mother%20Earth%20%28magazine%29">Mother Earth</a>" was staffed by a cadre of radical activists, including Hippolyte Havel, <a href="Max%20Baginski">Max Baginski</a>, and <a href="Leonard%20Abbott">Leonard Abbott</a>. In addition to publishing original works by its editors and anarchists around the world, "Mother Earth" reprinted selections from a variety of writers. These included the French philosopher <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, Russian anarchist <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>, German philosopher <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, and British writer <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>. Goldman wrote frequently about anarchism, politics, labor issues, atheism, sexuality, and feminism, and was the first editor of the magazine.

On May 18 of the same year, Alexander Berkman was released from prison. Carrying a bouquet of roses, Goldman met him on the train platform and found herself "seized by terror and pity" as she beheld his gaunt, pale form. Neither was able to speak; they returned to her home in silence. For weeks, he struggled to readjust to life on the outside. An abortive speaking tour ended in failure, and in Cleveland he purchased a revolver with the intent of killing himself. He returned to New York, however, and learned that Goldman had been arrested with a group of activists meeting to reflect on Czolgosz. Invigorated anew by this violation of <a href="freedom%20of%20assembly">freedom of assembly</a>, he declared, "My resurrection has come!" and set about securing their release.

Berkman took the helm of "Mother Earth" in 1907, while Goldman toured the country to raise funds to keep it operating. Editing the magazine was a revitalizing experience for Berkman. But his relationship with Goldman faltered, and he had an affair with a 15-year-old anarchist named <a href="Becky%20Edelsohn">Becky Edelsohn</a>. Goldman was pained by his rejection of her, but considered it a consequence of his prison experience. Later that year she served as a delegate from the US to the <a href="International%20Anarchist%20Congress%20of%20Amsterdam">International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam</a>. Anarchists and <a href="syndicalism">syndicalists</a> from around the world gathered to sort out the tension between the two ideologies, but no decisive agreement was reached. Goldman returned to the US and continued speaking to large audiences.

For the next ten years, Goldman traveled around the country nonstop, delivering lectures and agitating for anarchism. The coalitions formed in opposition to the Anarchist Exclusion Act had given her an appreciation for reaching out to those of other political positions. When the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">US Justice Department</a> sent spies to observe, they reported the meetings as "packed". Writers, journalists, artists, judges, and workers from across the spectrum spoke of her "magnetic power", her "convincing presence", her "force, eloquence, and fire".

In the spring of 1908, Goldman met and fell in love with <a href="Ben%20Reitman">Ben Reitman</a>, the so-called "Hobo doctor." Having grown up in Chicago's Tenderloin District, Reitman spent several years as a drifter before earning a medical degree from the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20College%20of%20Medicine">College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago</a>. As a doctor, he treated people suffering from poverty and illness, particularly <a href="venereal%20disease">venereal disease</a>s. He and Goldman began an affair. They shared a commitment to <a href="free%20love">free love</a> and Reitman took a variety of lovers, but Goldman did not. She tried to reconcile her feelings of jealousy with a belief in freedom of the heart, but found it difficult.

Two years later, Goldman began feeling frustrated with lecture audiences. She yearned to "reach the few who really want to learn, rather than the many who come to be amused". She collected a series of speeches and items she had written for "Mother Earth" and published a book titled "<a href="Anarchism%20and%20Other%20Essays">Anarchism and Other Essays</a>." Covering a wide variety of topics, Goldman tried to represent "the mental and soul struggles of twenty-one years". In addition to a comprehensive look at anarchism and its criticisms, the book includes essays on patriotism, <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>, marriage, and prisons.

When <a href="Margaret%20Sanger">Margaret Sanger</a>, an advocate of access to <a href="contraception">contraception</a>, coined the term "birth control" and disseminated information about various methods in the June 1914 issue of her magazine "The Woman Rebel," she received aggressive support from Goldman. The latter had already been active in efforts to increase birth control access for several years. In 1916, Goldman was arrested for giving lessons in public on how to use contraceptives. Sanger, too, was arrested under the <a href="Comstock%20Law">Comstock Law</a>, which prohibited the dissemination of "obscene, lewd, or lascivious articles", which authorities defined as including information relating to birth control.

Although they later split from Sanger over charges of insufficient support, Goldman and Reitman distributed copies of Sanger's pamphlet "Family Limitation" (along with a similar essay of Reitman's). In 1915 Goldman conducted a nationwide speaking tour, in part to raise awareness about contraception options. Although the nation's attitude toward the topic seemed to be liberalizing, Goldman was arrested on February 11, 1916, as she was about to give another public lecture. Goldman was charged with violating the Comstock Law. Refusing to pay a $100 fine, Goldman spent two weeks in a prison workhouse, which she saw as an "opportunity" to reconnect with those rejected by society.

Although US President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> was re-elected in 1916 under the slogan "He kept us out of the war", at the start of his second term, he announced that <a href="Germany">Germany</a>'s continued deployment of <a href="unrestricted%20submarine%20warfare">unrestricted submarine warfare</a> was sufficient cause for the US to enter <a href="World%20War%20I">the Great War</a>. Shortly afterward, Congress passed the <a href="Selective%20Service%20Act%20of%201917">Selective Service Act of 1917</a>, which required all males aged 21–30 to register for military <a href="conscription">conscription</a>. Goldman saw the decision as an exercise in <a href="militarism">militarist</a> aggression, driven by capitalism. She declared in "Mother Earth" her intent to resist conscription, and to oppose US involvement in the war.

To this end, she and Berkman organized the <a href="No%20conscription%20league">No Conscription League</a> of New York, which proclaimed: "We oppose conscription because we are internationalists, antimilitarists, and opposed to all wars waged by capitalistic governments." The group became a vanguard for anti-draft activism, and chapters began to appear in other cities. When police began raiding the group's public events to find young men who had not registered for the draft, however, Goldman and others focused their efforts on distributing pamphlets and other writings. In the midst of the nation's patriotic fervor, many elements of the political left refused to support the League's efforts. The Women's Peace Party, for example, ceased its opposition to the war once the US entered it. The <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist Party of America</a> took an official stance against US involvement, but supported Wilson in most of his activities.

On June 15, 1917, Goldman and Berkman were arrested during a raid of their offices, in which authorities seized "a wagon load of anarchist records and propaganda". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that Goldman asked to change into a more appropriate outfit, and emerged in a gown of "royal purple". The pair were charged with conspiracy to "induce persons not to register" under the newly enacted <a href="Espionage%20Act%20of%201917">Espionage Act</a>, and were held on US$25,000 bail each. Defending herself and Berkman during their trial, Goldman invoked the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a>, asking how the government could claim to fight for democracy abroad while suppressing free speech at home:

We say that if America has entered the war to make the world safe for democracy, she must first make democracy safe in America. How else is the world to take America seriously, when democracy at home is daily being outraged, free speech suppressed, peaceable assemblies broken up by overbearing and brutal gangsters in uniform; when free press is curtailed and every independent opinion gagged? Verily, poor as we are in democracy, how can we give of it to the world? 

The jury found Goldman and Berkman guilty. Judge <a href="Julius%20Marshuetz%20Mayer">Julius Marshuetz Mayer</a> imposed the maximum sentence: two years' imprisonment, a $10,000 fine each, and the possibility of <a href="deportation">deportation</a> after their release from prison. As she was transported to <a href="Missouri%20State%20Penitentiary">Missouri State Penitentiary</a>, Goldman wrote to a friend: "Two years imprisonment for having made an uncompromising stand for one's ideal. Why that is a small price."

In prison, she was assigned to work as a seamstress, under the eye of a "miserable gutter-snipe of a 21-year-old boy paid to get results". She met the socialist <a href="Kate%20Richards%20O%27Hare">Kate Richards O'Hare</a>, who had also been imprisoned under the Espionage Act. Although they differed on political strategy— O'Hare believed in voting to achieve state power—the two women came together to agitate for better conditions among prisoners. Goldman also met and became friends with <a href="Gabriella%20Segata%20Antolini">Gabriella Segata Antolini</a>, an anarchist and follower of <a href="Luigi%20Galleani">Luigi Galleani</a>. Antolini had been arrested transporting a satchel filled with dynamite on a Chicago-bound train. She had refused to cooperate with authorities, and was sent to prison for 14 months. Working together to make life better for the other inmates, the three women became known as "The Trinity". Goldman was released on September 27, 1919.

Goldman and Berkman were released from prison during the United States' <a href="First%20Red%20Scare">Red Scare of 1919–20</a>, when public anxiety about wartime pro-German activities had expanded into a pervasive fear of Bolshevism and the prospect of an imminent radical revolution. It was a time of social unrest due to union organizing strikes and actions by activist immigrants. <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="Alexander%20Mitchell%20Palmer">Alexander Mitchell Palmer</a> and <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a>, head of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">US Department of Justice's</a> General Intelligence Division (now the FBI), were intent on using the <a href="Anarchist%20Exclusion%20Act">Anarchist Exclusion Act</a> and its <a href="Immigration%20Act%20of%201918%23Definition%20of%20anarchist">1918 expansion</a> to deport any non-citizens they could identify as advocates of anarchy or revolution. "Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman," Hoover wrote while they were in prison, "are, beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists in this country and return to the community will result in undue harm."

At her deportation hearing on October 27, Goldman refused to answer questions about her beliefs, on the grounds that her American citizenship invalidated any attempt to deport her under the Anarchist Exclusion Act, which could be enforced only against non-citizens of the US. She presented a written statement instead: "Today so-called <a href="Alien%20%28law%29">aliens</a> are deported. Tomorrow native Americans will be banished. Already some patrioteers are suggesting that native American sons to whom democracy is a sacred ideal should be exiled." <a href="Louis%20Freeland%20Post">Louis Post</a> at the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor">Department of Labor</a>, which had ultimate authority over deportation decisions, determined that the revocation of her husband Kershner's American citizenship in 1908 after his conviction had revoked hers as well. After initially promising a court fight, Goldman decided not to appeal his ruling.

The Labor Department included Goldman and Berkman among 249 aliens it deported "en masse," mostly people with only vague associations with radical groups, who had been swept up in <a href="Palmer%20Raids">government raids</a> in November. "<a href="USAT%20Buford">Buford</a>", a ship the press nicknamed the "Soviet Ark," sailed from the Army's <a href="New%20York%20Port%20of%20Embarkation">New York Port of Embarkation</a> on December 21. Some 58 enlisted men and four officers provided security on the journey, and pistols were distributed to the crew. Most of the press approved enthusiastically. The Cleveland "Plain Dealer" wrote: "It is hoped and expected that other vessels, larger, more commodious, carrying similar cargoes, will follow in her wake." The ship landed her charges in <a href="Hanko">Hanko</a>, <a href="Finland">Finland</a> on Saturday, January 17, 1920. Upon arrival in Finland, authorities there conducted the deportees to the Russian frontier under a flag of truce.

Goldman initially viewed the Bolshevik revolution in a positive light. She wrote in "Mother Earth" that despite its dependence on Communist government, it represented "the most fundamental, far-reaching and all-embracing principles of human freedom and of economic well-being". By the time she neared Europe, however, she expressed fears about what was to come. She was worried about the ongoing <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a> and the possibility of being seized by anti-Bolshevik forces. The state, anti-capitalist though it was, also posed a threat. "I could never in my life work within the confines of the State," she wrote to her niece, "Bolshevist or otherwise."
She quickly discovered that her fears were justified. Days after returning to <a href="Petrograd">Petrograd</a> (Saint Petersburg), she was shocked to hear a party official refer to free speech as a "bourgeois superstition". As she and Berkman traveled around the country, they found repression, mismanagement, and corruption instead of the equality and worker empowerment they had dreamed of. Those who questioned the government were demonized as <a href="counter-revolutionary">counter-revolutionaries</a>, and workers labored under severe conditions. They met with <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, who assured them that government suppression of press liberties was justified. He told them: "There can be no free speech in a revolutionary period." Berkman was more willing to forgive the government's actions in the name of "historical necessity", but he eventually joined Goldman in opposing the Soviet state's authority.

In March 1921, strikes erupted in Petrograd when workers took to the streets demanding better food rations and more <a href="Trade%20union">union</a> autonomy. Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: "To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal." The unrest spread to the port town of <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a>, where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the <a href="Kronstadt%20rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a>, approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them. "More and more", she wrote, "we have come to the conclusion that we can do nothing here. And as we can not keep up a life of inactivity much longer we have decided to leave."

In December 1921, they left the country and went to the Latvian capital city of <a href="Riga">Riga</a>. The US commissioner in that city wired officials in Washington DC, who began requesting information from other governments about the couple's activities. After a short trip to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, they moved to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> for several years; during this time Goldman agreed to write a series of articles about her time in Russia for <a href="Joseph%20Pulitzer">Joseph Pulitzer</a>'s newspaper, the "<a href="New%20York%20World">New York World</a>." These were later collected and published in book form as "<a href="My%20Disillusionment%20in%20Russia">My Disillusionment in Russia</a>" (1923) and "<a href="My%20Further%20Disillusionment%20in%20Russia">My Further Disillusionment in Russia</a>" (1924). The publishers added these titles to attract attention; Goldman protested, albeit in vain.

Goldman found it difficult to acclimate to the German leftist community in Berlin. Communists despised her outspokenness about Soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. While Berkman remained in Berlin helping Russian exiles, Goldman moved to London in September 1924. Upon her arrival, the novelist <a href="Rebecca%20West">Rebecca West</a> arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, novelist <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, and more than 200 other guests. When she spoke of her dissatisfaction with the Soviet government, the audience was shocked. Some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the Communist experiment. Later, in a letter, Russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the Soviet Union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism.

In 1925, the spectre of deportation loomed again, but a Scottish anarchist named <a href="James%20Colton">James Colton</a> offered to marry her and provide British citizenship. Although they were only distant acquaintances, she accepted and they were married on June 27, 1925. Her new status gave her peace of mind, and allowed her to travel to France and Canada. Life in London was stressful for Goldman; she wrote to Berkman: "I am awfully tired and so lonely and heartsick. It is a dreadful feeling to come back here from lectures and find not a kindred soul, no one who cares whether one is dead or alive." She worked on analytical studies of drama, expanding on the work she had published in 1914. But the audiences were "awful," and she never finished her second book on the subject.

Goldman traveled to Canada in 1927, just in time to receive news of the impending executions of Italian anarchists <a href="Nicola%20Sacco">Nicola Sacco</a> and <a href="Bartolomeo%20Vanzetti">Bartolomeo Vanzetti</a> in Boston. Angered by the many irregularities of the case, she saw it as another travesty of justice in the US. She longed to join the mass demonstrations in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>; memories of the <a href="Haymarket%20affair">Haymarket affair</a> overwhelmed her, compounded by her isolation. "Then," she wrote, "I had my life before me to take up the cause for those killed. Now I have nothing."

In 1928, she began writing her autobiography, with the support of a group of American admirers, including journalist <a href="H.%20L.%20Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a>, poet <a href="Edna%20St.%20Vincent%20Millay">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a>, novelist <a href="Theodore%20Dreiser">Theodore Dreiser</a> and art collector <a href="Peggy%20Guggenheim">Peggy Guggenheim</a>, who raised $4,000 for her. She secured a cottage in the French coastal city of <a href="Saint-Tropez">Saint-Tropez</a> and spent two years recounting her life. Berkman offered sharply critical feedback, which she eventually incorporated at the price of a strain on their relationship. Goldman intended the book, "<a href="Living%20My%20Life">Living My Life</a>," as a single volume for a price the working class could afford (she urged no more than $5.00); her publisher <a href="Alfred%20A.%20Knopf">Alfred A. Knopf</a>, however, released it as two volumes sold together for $7.50. Goldman was furious, but unable to force a change. Due in large part to the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, sales were sluggish despite keen interest from libraries around the US. Critical reviews were generally enthusiastic; "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", and "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28US%20magazine%29">Saturday Review of Literature</a>" all listed it as one of the year's top non-fiction books.

In 1933, Goldman received permission to lecture in the United States under the condition that she speak only about drama and her autobiography—but not current political events. She returned to New York on February 2, 1934 to generally positive press coverage—except from Communist publications. Soon she was surrounded by admirers and friends, besieged with invitations to talks and interviews. Her visa expired in May, and she went to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> in order to file another request to visit the US. However, this second attempt was denied. She stayed in Canada, writing articles for US publications.

In February and March 1936, Berkman underwent a pair of <a href="prostate%20gland">prostate gland</a> operations. Recuperating in <a href="Nice">Nice</a> and cared for by his companion, Emmy Eckstein, he missed Goldman's sixty-seventh birthday in <a href="Saint-Tropez">Saint-Tropez</a> in June. She wrote in sadness, but he never read the letter; she received a call in the middle of the night that Berkman was in great distress. She left for Nice immediately but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose <a href="paralysis">paralysis</a>. He died later that evening.

In July 1936, the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> started after an attempted "coup d'état" by parts of the <a href="Spanish%20Army">Spanish Army</a> against the government of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>. At the same time, the <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Spain">Spanish anarchists</a>, fighting against the <a href="National%20faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29">Nationalist forces</a>, started <a href="Spanish%20Revolution%20of%201936">an anarchist revolution</a>. Goldman was invited to <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and in an instant, as she wrote to her niece, "the crushing weight that was pressing down on my heart since Sasha's death left me as by magic". She was welcomed by the <a href="Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</a> (CNT) and <a href="Federaci%C3%B3n%20Anarquista%20Ib%C3%A9rica">Federación Anarquista Ibérica</a> (FAI) organizations, and for the first time in her life lived in a <a href="Revolutionary%20Catalonia">community run by and for anarchists</a>, according to true anarchist principles. "In all my life", she wrote later, "I have not met with such warm hospitality, comradeship and solidarity." After touring a series of <a href="collectives">collectives</a> in the province of <a href="Huesca%20%28province%29">Huesca</a>, she told a group of workers: "Your revolution will destroy forever [the notion] that anarchism stands for chaos." She began editing the weekly "CNT-FAI Information Bulletin" and responded to English-language mail.

Goldman began to worry about the future of Spain's anarchism when the CNT-FAI joined a coalition government in 1937—against the core anarchist principle of abstaining from state structures—and, more distressingly, made repeated concessions to Communist forces in the name of uniting against fascism. She wrote that cooperating with Communists in Spain was "a denial of our comrades in Stalin's concentration camps". Russia, meanwhile, refused to send weapons to anarchist forces, and disinformation campaigns were being waged against the anarchists across Europe and the US. Her faith in the movement unshaken, Goldman returned to London as an official representative of the CNT-FAI.

Delivering lectures and giving interviews, Goldman enthusiastically supported the Spanish anarcho-syndicalists. She wrote regularly for "<a href="Spain%20and%20the%20World">Spain and the World</a>", a biweekly newspaper focusing on the civil war. In May 1937, however, Communist-led forces <a href="Barcelona%20May%20Days">attacked anarchist strongholds</a> and broke up agrarian collectives. Newspapers in England and elsewhere accepted the timeline of events offered by the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a> at face value. British journalist <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>, present for the crackdown, wrote: "[T]he accounts of the Barcelona riots in May ... beat everything I have ever seen for lying."

Goldman returned to Spain in September, but the CNT-FAI appeared to her like people "in a burning house". Worse, anarchists and other radicals around the world refused to support their cause. The Nationalist forces declared victory in Spain just before she returned to London. Frustrated by England's repressive atmosphere—which she called "more fascist than the fascists"—she returned to Canada in 1939. Her service to the anarchist cause in Spain was not forgotten, however. On her seventieth birthday, the former Secretary-General of the CNT-FAI, Mariano Vázquez, sent a message to her from Paris, praising her for her contributions and naming her as "our spiritual mother". She called it "the most beautiful tribute I have ever received".

As the events preceding <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> began to unfold in Europe, Goldman reiterated her opposition to wars waged by governments. "[M]uch as I loathe <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a>, <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Mussolini</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a> and <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Franco</a>", she wrote to a friend, "I would not support a war against them and for the democracies which, in the last analysis, are only Fascist in disguise." She felt that Britain and France had missed their opportunity to oppose fascism, and that the coming war would only result in "a new form of madness in the world".

On Saturday, February 17, 1940, Goldman suffered a debilitating stroke. She became paralyzed on her right side, and although her hearing was unaffected, she could not speak. As one friend described it: "Just to think that here was Emma, the greatest orator in America, unable to utter one word." For three months she improved slightly, receiving visitors and on one occasion gesturing to her address book to signal that a friend might find friendly contacts during a trip to <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. She suffered another stroke on May 8, however, and on May 14 she died in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, aged 70.

The US <a href="Immigration%20and%20Naturalization%20Service">Immigration and Naturalization Service</a> allowed her body to be brought back to the United States. She was buried in <a href="German%20Waldheim%20Cemetery">German Waldheim Cemetery</a> (now named Forest Home Cemetery) in <a href="Forest%20Park%2C%20Illinois">Forest Park</a>, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago, near the graves of those executed after the <a href="Haymarket%20affair">Haymarket affair</a>. The <a href="bas%20relief">bas relief</a> on her grave marker was created by sculptor <a href="Jo%20Davidson">Jo Davidson</a>.

Goldman spoke and wrote extensively on a wide variety of issues. While she rejected <a href="orthodoxy">orthodoxy</a> and fundamentalist thinking, she was an important contributor to several fields of modern political philosophy. She was influenced by many diverse thinkers and writers, including <a href="Mikhail%20Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a>, <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>, <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>, <a href="Nikolai%20Chernyshevsky">Nikolai Chernyshevsky</a>, and <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>. Another philosopher who influenced Goldman was <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>. In her autobiography, she wrote: "Nietzsche was not a social theorist, but a poet, a rebel, and innovator. His aristocracy was neither of birth nor of purse; it was the spirit. In that respect Nietzsche was an anarchist, and all true anarchists were <a href="Aristocracy%20%28government%29">aristocrats</a>."

Anarchism was central to Goldman's view of the world and she is today considered one of the most important figures in the history of anarchism. First drawn to it during the persecution of anarchists after the 1886 <a href="Haymarket%20affair">Haymarket affair</a>, she wrote and spoke regularly on behalf of anarchism. In the title essay of her book "<a href="Anarchism%20and%20Other%20Essays">Anarchism and Other Essays</a>", she wrote:
Anarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.
Goldman's anarchism was intensely personal. She believed it was necessary for anarchist thinkers to live their beliefs, demonstrating their convictions with every action and word. "I don't care if a man's theory for tomorrow is correct," she once wrote. "I care if his spirit of today is correct." Anarchism and free association were to her logical responses to the confines of government control and capitalism. "It seems to me that "these" are the new forms of life," she wrote, "and that they will take the place of the old, not by preaching or voting, but by living them."

At the same time, she believed that the movement on behalf of human liberty must be staffed by liberated humans. While dancing among fellow anarchists one evening, she was chided by an associate for her carefree demeanor. In her autobiography, Goldman wrote:
I told him to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause constantly thrown in my face. I did not believe that a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it. "I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things."
Goldman, in her political youth, held targeted violence to be a legitimate means of revolutionary struggle. Goldman at the time believed that the use of violence, while distasteful, could be justified in relation to the social benefits it might accrue. She advocated <a href="propaganda%20of%20the%20deed">propaganda of the deed</a>—"attentat", or violence carried out to encourage the masses to revolt. She supported her partner <a href="Alexander%20Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a>'s attempt to kill industrialist <a href="Henry%20Clay%20Frick">Henry Clay Frick</a>, and even begged him to allow her to participate. She believed that Frick's actions during the <a href="Homestead%20strike">Homestead strike</a> were reprehensible and that his murder would produce a positive result for working people. "Yes," she wrote later in her autobiography, "the end in this case justified the means." While she never gave explicit approval of <a href="Leon%20Czolgosz">Leon Czolgosz</a>'s assassination of US President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>, she defended his ideals and believed actions like his were a natural consequence of repressive institutions. As she wrote in "The Psychology of Political Violence": "the accumulated forces in our social and economic life, culminating in an act of violence, are similar to the terrors of the atmosphere, manifested in storm and lightning."

Her experiences in Russia led her to qualify her earlier belief that revolutionary ends might justify violent means. In the afterword to "<a href="My%20Disillusionment%20in%20Russia">My Disillusionment in Russia</a>", she wrote: "There is no greater fallacy than the belief that aims and purposes are one thing, while methods and tactics are another... The means employed become, through individual habit and social practice, part and parcel of the final purpose..." In the same chapter, however, Goldman affirmed that "Revolution is indeed a violent process," and noted that violence was the "tragic inevitability of revolutionary upheavals..." Some misinterpreted her comments on the Bolshevik terror as a rejection of all militant force, but Goldman corrected this in the preface to the first US edition of "My Disillusionment in Russia":

The argument that destruction and terror are part of revolution I do not dispute. I know that in the past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet it is one thing to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.

Goldman saw the militarization of Soviet society not as a result of armed resistance per se, but of the statist vision of the Bolsheviks, writing that "an insignificant minority bent on creating an absolute State is necessarily driven to oppression and terrorism."

Goldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. "The only demand that property recognizes," she wrote in "Anarchism and Other Essays", "is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade." She also argued that <a href="criticism%20of%20capitalism">capitalism dehumanized workers</a>, "turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron."

Originally opposed to anything less than complete revolution, Goldman was challenged during one talk by an elderly worker in the front row. In her autobiography, she wrote:
He said that he understood my impatience with such small demands as a few hours less a day, or a few dollars more a week... But what were men of his age to do? They were not likely to live to see the ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. Were they also to forgo the release of perhaps two hours a day from the hated work? That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.
Goldman realized that smaller efforts for improvement such as higher wages and shorter hours could be part of a social revolution.

Goldman viewed the state as essentially and inevitably a tool of control and domination. As a result, Goldman believed that voting was useless at best and dangerous at worst. Voting, she wrote, provided an illusion of participation while masking the true structures of decision-making. Instead, Goldman advocated targeted resistance in the form of strikes, protests, and "direct action against the invasive, meddlesome authority of our moral code". She maintained an anti-voting position even when many anarcho-syndicalists in 1930s Spain voted for the formation of a liberal republic. Goldman wrote that any power anarchists wielded as a voting bloc should instead be used to strike across the country. She disagreed with the movement for <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>, which demanded the right of women to vote. In her essay "Woman Suffrage", she ridicules the idea that women's involvement would infuse the democratic state with a more just orientation: "As if women have not sold their votes, as if women politicians cannot be bought!" She agreed with the suffragists' assertion that women are equal to men, but disagreed that their participation alone would make the state more just. "To assume, therefore, that she would succeed in purifying something which is not susceptible of purification, is to credit her with supernatural powers."

Goldman was also a passionate critic of the prison system, critiquing both the treatment of prisoners and the social causes of crime. Goldman viewed crime as a natural outgrowth of an unjust economic system, and in her essay "Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure", she quoted liberally from the 19th-century authors <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a> and <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> on prisons, and wrote: Year after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an emaciated, deformed, will-less, shipwrecked crew of humanity, with the Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their natural inclinations thwarted. With nothing but hunger and inhumanity to greet them, these victims soon sink back into crime as the only possibility of existence.

Goldman was a committed <a href="war%20resister">war resister</a>, believing that wars were fought by the state on behalf of capitalists. She was particularly opposed to the <a href="conscription">draft</a>, viewing it as one of the worst of the state's forms of coercion, and was one of the founders of the <a href="No-Conscription%20League">No-Conscription League</a>—for which she was ultimately arrested (1917), imprisoned and deported (1919).

Goldman was routinely surveilled, arrested, and imprisoned for her speech and organizing activities in support of <a href="workers">workers</a> and various strikes, access to <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a>, and in <a href="opposition%20to%20World%20War%20I">opposition to World War I</a>. As a result, she became active in the early 20th century free speech movement, seeing freedom of expression as a fundamental necessity for achieving social change. Her outspoken championship of her ideals, in the face of persistent arrests, inspired <a href="Roger%20Nash%20Baldwin">Roger Baldwin</a>, one of the founders of the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>. Goldman's and Reitman's experiences in the <a href="San%20Diego%20free%20speech%20fight">San Diego free speech fight</a> (1912) were notorious examples of state and capitalist repression of the <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a>'s campaign of <a href="free%20speech%20fights">free speech fights</a>.

Although she was hostile to the suffragist goals of <a href="first-wave%20feminism">first-wave feminism</a>, Goldman advocated passionately for the rights of women, and is today heralded as a founder of <a href="anarcha-feminism">anarcha-feminism</a>, which challenges <a href="patriarchy">patriarchy</a> as a hierarchy to be resisted alongside state power and class divisions. In 1897, she wrote: "I demand the independence of woman, her right to support herself; to live for herself; to love whomever she pleases, or as many as she pleases. I demand freedom for both sexes, freedom of action, freedom in love and freedom in motherhood."

A nurse by training, Goldman was an early advocate for educating women concerning <a href="Birth%20control">contraception</a>. Like many feminists of her time, she saw abortion as a tragic consequence of social conditions, and birth control as a positive alternative. Goldman was also an advocate of <a href="free%20love">free love</a>, and a strong critic of marriage. She saw early feminists as confined in their scope and bounded by social forces of <a href="Religious%20fanaticism">Puritanism</a> and capitalism. She wrote: "We are in need of unhampered growth out of old traditions and habits. The movement for women's emancipation has so far made but the first step in that direction."

Goldman was also an outspoken critic of <a href="homophobia">prejudice against homosexuals</a>. Her belief that social liberation should extend to gay men and lesbians was virtually unheard of at the time, even among anarchists. As German sexologist <a href="Magnus%20Hirschfeld">Magnus Hirschfeld</a> wrote, "she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public." In numerous speeches and letters, she defended the right of gay men and lesbians to love as they pleased and condemned the fear and stigma associated with homosexuality. As Goldman wrote in a letter to Hirschfeld, "It is a tragedy, I feel, that people of a different sexual type are caught in a world which shows so little understanding for homosexuals and is so crassly indifferent to the various gradations and variations of gender and their great significance in life."

A committed <a href="atheist">atheist</a>, Goldman viewed religion as another instrument of control and domination. Her essay "The Philosophy of Atheism" quoted Bakunin at length on the subject and added:
Consciously or unconsciously, most theists see in gods and devils, heaven and hell, reward and punishment, a whip to lash the people into obedience, meekness and contentment... The philosophy of Atheism expresses the expansion and growth of the human mind. The philosophy of <a href="theism">theism</a>, if we can call it a philosophy, is static and fixed.
In essays like "The Hypocrisy of Puritanism" and a speech entitled "The Failure of Christianity", Goldman made more than a few enemies among religious communities by attacking their moralistic attitudes and efforts to control human behavior. She blamed Christianity for "the perpetuation of a slave society", arguing that it dictated individuals' actions on Earth and offered poor people a false promise of a plentiful future in heaven. She was also critical of <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a>, which she saw as another failed experiment in state control.

Goldman was well known during her life, described as—among other things—"the most dangerous woman in America". After her death and through the middle part of the 20th century, her fame faded. Scholars and historians of anarchism viewed her as a great speaker and activist, but did not regard her as a philosophical or theoretical thinker on par with, for instance, <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a>.

In 1970, <a href="Dover%20Press">Dover Press</a> reissued Goldman's biography, "Living My Life", and in 1972, feminist writer <a href="Alix%20Kates%20Shulman">Alix Kates Shulman</a> issued a collection of Goldman's writing and speeches, "Red Emma Speaks". These works brought Goldman's life and writings to a larger audience, and she was in particular lionized by the <a href="Second-wave%20feminism">women's movement</a> of the late 20th century. In 1973, Shulman was asked by a printer friend for a quotation by Goldman for use on a T-shirt. She sent him the selection from "Living My Life" about "the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things", recounting that she had been admonished "that it did not behoove an agitator to dance". The printer created a statement based on these sentiments that has become one of Goldman's most famous quotations, even though she probably never said or wrote it as such: "If I can't dance I don't want to be in your revolution." Variations of this saying have appeared on thousands of T-shirts, buttons, posters, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, hats, and other items.

The women's movement of the 1970s that "rediscovered" Goldman was accompanied by a resurgent anarchist movement, beginning in the late 1960s, which also reinvigorated scholarly attention to earlier anarchists. The growth of <a href="feminism">feminism</a> also initiated some reevaluation of Goldman's philosophical work, with scholars pointing out the significance of Goldman's contributions to anarchist thought in her time. Goldman's belief in the value of <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, for example, can be seen in the later influences of <a href="anarchism%20and%20the%20arts">anarchism and the arts</a>. Similarly, Goldman is now given credit for significantly influencing and broadening the scope of activism on issues of sexual liberty, reproductive rights, and freedom of expression.

Goldman has been depicted in numerous works of fiction over the years, including <a href="Warren%20Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>'s 1981 film "<a href="Reds%20%28film%29">Reds</a>", in which she was portrayed by <a href="Maureen%20Stapleton">Maureen Stapleton</a>, who won an <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a> for her performance. Goldman has also been a character in two Broadway musicals, "<a href="Ragtime%20%28musical%29">Ragtime</a>" and "<a href="Assassins%20%28musical%29">Assassins</a>". Plays depicting Goldman's life include <a href="Howard%20Zinn">Howard Zinn</a>'s play, "<a href="Emma%20%28play%29">Emma</a>"; <a href="Martin%20Duberman">Martin Duberman</a>'s "Mother Earth" (1991); Jessica Litwak's "Emma Goldman: Love, Anarchy, and Other Affairs" (Goldman's relationship with Berkman and her arrest in connection with McKinley's assassination); <a href="Lynn%20Rogoff">Lynn Rogoff</a>'s "Love Ben, Love Emma" (Goldman's relationship with Reitman);, <a href="Carol%20Bolt">Carol Bolt</a>'s "Red Emma"; and Alexis Roblan's "Red Emma and the Mad Monk". <a href="Ethel%20Mannin">Ethel Mannin</a>'s 1941 novel "Red Rose" is also based on Goldman's Life.

Goldman has been honored by a number of organizations named in her memory. The Emma Goldman Clinic, a women's health center located in <a href="Iowa%20City%2C%20Iowa">Iowa City, Iowa</a>, selected Goldman as a namesake "in recognition of her challenging spirit." <a href="Red%20Emma%27s%20Bookstore%20Coffeehouse">Red Emma's Bookstore Coffeehouse</a>, an <a href="infoshop">infoshop</a> in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a> adopted her name out of their belief "in the ideas and ideals that she fought for her entire life: free speech, sexual and racial equality and independence, the right to organize in our jobs and in our own lives, ideas and ideals that we continue to fight for, even today".

Paul Gailiunas and his late wife <a href="Helen%20Hill">Helen Hill</a> co-wrote the anarchist song "Emma Goldman", which was performed and released by the band Piggy: The Calypso Orchestra of the Maritimes in 1999. The song was later performed by Gailiunas' new band The Troublemakers and released on their 2004 album "Here Come The Troublemakers".

UK punk band <a href="Martha%20%28band%29">Martha</a>'s song "Goldman's Detective Agency" reimagines Goldman as a private detective investigating police and political corruption.

Goldman was a prolific writer, penning countless pamphlets and articles on a diverse range of subjects. She authored six books, including an autobiography, "<a href="Living%20My%20Life">Living My Life</a>", and a biography of fellow anarchist <a href="Voltairine%20de%20Cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a>.

Edward Elgar

Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet (; 2 June 1857 – 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the "<a href="Enigma%20Variations">Enigma Variations</a>", the "<a href="Pomp%20and%20Circumstance%20Marches">Pomp and Circumstance Marches</a>", concertos for <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Elgar%29">violin</a> and <a href="Cello%20Concerto%20%28Elgar%29">cello</a>, and two <a href="symphony">symphonies</a>. He also composed choral works, including "<a href="The%20Dream%20of%20Gerontius">The Dream of Gerontius</a>", chamber music and songs. He was appointed <a href="Master%20of%20the%20King%27s%20Musick">Master of the King's Musick</a> in 1924.

Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>ism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> and <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian</a> Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his "Enigma Variations" (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, "The Dream of Gerontius" (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory.

In his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, to be seen as appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained low for a generation after his death. It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues to be played more in Britain than elsewhere.

Elgar has been described as the first composer to take the <a href="Gramophone%20record">gramophone</a> seriously. Between 1914 and 1925, he conducted a series of <a href="acoustic%20recording">acoustic recording</a>s of his works. The introduction of the <a href="moving-coil%20microphone">moving-coil microphone</a> in 1923 made far more accurate sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most of his major orchestral works and excerpts from "The Dream of Gerontius".

Edward Elgar was born in the small village of <a href="Broadheath%2C%20Worcestershire">Lower Broadheath</a>, outside <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>, England. His father, William Henry Elgar (1821–1906), was raised in <a href="Dover">Dover</a> and had been apprenticed to a London music publisher. In 1841 William moved to Worcester, where he worked as a <a href="Piano%20tuning">piano tuner</a> and set up a shop selling sheet music and musical instruments. In 1848 he married Ann Greening (1822–1902), daughter of a farm worker. Edward was the fourth of their seven children. Ann Elgar had converted to Roman Catholicism shortly before Edward's birth, and he was baptised and brought up as a Roman Catholic, to the disapproval of his father. William Elgar was a violinist of professional standard and held the post of organist of <a href="St%20George%27s%20Church%2C%20Worcester">St. George's Roman Catholic Church, Worcester</a>, from 1846 to 1885. At his instigation, masses by <a href="Luigi%20Cherubini">Cherubini</a> and <a href="Johann%20Nepomuk%20Hummel">Hummel</a> were first heard at the <a href="Three%20Choirs%20Festival">Three Choirs Festival</a> by the orchestra in which he played the violin. All the Elgar children received a musical upbringing. By the age of eight, Elgar was taking piano and violin lessons, and his father, who tuned the pianos at many grand houses in Worcestershire, would sometimes take him along, giving him the chance to display his skill to important local figures.
Elgar's mother was interested in the arts and encouraged his musical development. He inherited from her a discerning taste for literature and a passionate love of the countryside. His friend and biographer <a href="William%20Henry%20Reed">W. H. "Billy" Reed</a> wrote that Elgar's early surroundings had an influence that "permeated all his work and gave to his whole life that subtle but none the less true and sturdy English quality". He began composing at an early age; for a play written and acted by the Elgar children when he was about ten, he wrote music that forty years later he rearranged with only minor changes and orchestrated as the suites titled "<a href="The%20Wand%20of%20Youth">The Wand of Youth</a>".

Until he was fifteen, Elgar received a general education at Littleton (now Lyttleton) House school, near Worcester. However, his only formal musical training beyond piano and violin lessons from local teachers consisted of more advanced violin studies with <a href="Adolf%20Pollitzer">Adolf Pollitzer</a>, during brief visits to London in 1877–78. Elgar said, "my first music was learnt in the <a href="Worcester%20Cathedral">Cathedral</a> ... from books borrowed from the music library, when I was eight, nine or ten." He worked through manuals of instruction on organ playing and read every book he could find on the theory of music. He later said that he had been most helped by <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Hubert Parry</a>'s articles in the "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>". Elgar began to learn German, in the hope of going to the <a href="University%20of%20Music%20and%20Theatre%20Leipzig">Leipzig Conservatory</a> for further musical studies, but his father could not afford to send him. Years later, a profile in "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>" considered that his failure to get to Leipzig was fortunate for Elgar's musical development: "Thus the budding composer escaped the dogmatism of the schools." However, it was a disappointment to Elgar that on leaving school in 1872 he went not to Leipzig but to the office of a local solicitor as a clerk. He did not find an office career congenial, and for fulfilment he turned not only to music but to literature, becoming a voracious reader. Around this time, he made his first public appearances as a violinist and organist.

After a few months, Elgar left the solicitor to embark on a musical career, giving piano and violin lessons and working occasionally in his father's shop. He was an active member of the Worcester <a href="Glee%20club">Glee club</a>, along with his father, and he accompanied singers, played the violin, composed and arranged works, and conducted for the first time. Pollitzer believed that, as a violinist, Elgar had the potential to be one of the leading soloists in the country, but Elgar himself, having heard leading virtuosi at London concerts, felt his own violin playing lacked a full enough tone, and he abandoned his ambitions to be a soloist. At twenty-two he took up the post of conductor of the attendants' band at the <a href="Powick%20Hospital">Worcester and County Lunatic Asylum</a> in <a href="Powick">Powick</a>, from Worcester. The band consisted of: piccolo, flute, clarinet, two cornets, euphonium, three or four first and a similar number of second violins, occasional viola, cello, double bass and piano. Elgar coached the players and wrote and arranged their music, including <a href="quadrille">quadrille</a>s and polkas, for the unusual combination of instruments. "The Musical Times" wrote, "This practical experience proved to be of the greatest value to the young musician. ... He acquired a practical knowledge of the capabilities of these different instruments. ... He thereby got to know intimately the tone colour, the ins and outs of these and many other instruments." He held the post for five years, from 1879, travelling to Powick once a week. Another post he held in his early days was professor of the violin at the <a href="New%20College%20Worcester">Worcester College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen</a>.

Although rather solitary and introspective by nature, Elgar thrived in Worcester's musical circles. He played in the violins at the Worcester and <a href="Birmingham%20Triennial%20Music%20Festival">Birmingham</a> Festivals, and one great experience was to play <a href="Anton%C3%ADn%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k">Dvořák</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k%29">Symphony No. 6</a> and "<a href="Stabat%20Mater%20%28Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k%29">Stabat Mater</a>" under the composer's baton. Elgar regularly played the bassoon in a wind quintet, alongside his brother Frank, an oboist (and conductor who ran his own wind band). Elgar arranged numerous pieces by <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>, and others for the quintet, honing his arranging and compositional skills.
In his first trips abroad, Elgar visited Paris in 1880 and Leipzig in 1882. He heard <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Saint-Saëns</a> play the organ at the <a href="%C3%89glise%20de%20la%20Madeleine">Madeleine</a> and attended concerts by first-rate orchestras. In 1882 he wrote, "I got pretty well dosed with <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a> (my ideal!), <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>, <a href="Anton%20Rubinstein">Rubinstein</a> & <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>, so had no cause to complain." In Leipzig he visited a friend, Helen Weaver, who was a student at the Conservatoire. They became engaged in the summer of 1883, but for unknown reasons the engagement was broken off the next year. Elgar was greatly distressed, and some of his later cryptic dedications of romantic music may have alluded to Helen and his feelings for her. Throughout his life, Elgar was often inspired by close women friends; Helen Weaver was succeeded by Mary Lygon, Dora Penny, Julia Worthington, Alice Stuart Wortley and finally Vera Hockman, who enlivened his old age.

In 1882, seeking more professional orchestral experience, Elgar was employed to play violin in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> with <a href="William%20Stockley%27s%20Orchestra">William Stockley's Orchestra</a>, for whom he would play every concert for the next seven years and where he later claimed he "learned all the music I know". On 13 December 1883 he took part with Stockley in a performance at <a href="Birmingham%20Town%20Hall">Birmingham Town Hall</a> of one of his first works for full orchestra, the "Sérénade mauresque" – the first time one of his compositions had been performed by a professional orchestra. Stockley had invited him to conduct the piece but later recalled "he declined, and, further, insisted upon playing in his place in the orchestra. The consequence was that he had to appear, fiddle in hand, to acknowledge the genuine and hearty applause of the audience." Elgar often went to London in an attempt to get his works published, but this period in his life found him frequently despondent and low on money. He wrote to a friend in April 1884, "My prospects are about as hopeless as ever ... I am not wanting in energy I think, so sometimes I conclude that 'tis want of ability. ... I have no money – not a cent."

When Elgar was 29, he took on a new pupil, <a href="Caroline%20Alice%20Elgar">Caroline Alice Roberts</a>, daughter of the late <a href="Major-General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major-General</a> Sir Henry Roberts, and published author of <a href="poetry">verse</a> and <a href="prose">prose</a> fiction. Eight years older than Elgar, Alice became his wife three years later. Elgar's biographer <a href="Michael%20Kennedy%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Kennedy</a> writes, "Alice's family was horrified by her intention to marry an unknown musician who worked in a shop and was a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>. She was disinherited." They were married on 8 May 1889, at <a href="Brompton%20Oratory">Brompton Oratory</a>. From then until her death, she acted as his business manager and social secretary, dealt with his mood swings, and was a perceptive musical critic. She did her best to gain him the attention of influential society, though with limited success. In time, he would learn to accept the honours given him, realising that they mattered more to her and her social class and recognising what she had given up to further his career. In her diary, she wrote, "The care of a genius is enough of a life work for any woman." As an engagement present, Elgar dedicated his short violin-and-piano piece "<a href="Salut%20d%27Amour">Salut d'Amour</a>" to her. With Alice's encouragement, the Elgars moved to London to be closer to the centre of British musical life, and Elgar started devoting his time to composition. Their only child, Carice Irene, was born at their home in <a href="West%20Kensington">West Kensington</a> on 14 August 1890. Her name, revealed in Elgar's dedication of "Salut d'Amour", was a contraction of her mother's names Caroline and Alice.

Elgar took full advantage of the opportunity to hear unfamiliar music. In the days before miniature scores and recordings were available, it was not easy for young composers to get to know new music. Elgar took every chance to do so at the <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">Crystal Palace</a> concerts. He and Alice attended day after day, hearing music by a wide range of composers. Among these were masters of <a href="orchestration">orchestration</a> from whom he learned much, such as <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a> and Richard Wagner. His own compositions, however, made little impact on London's musical scene. <a href="August%20Manns">August Manns</a> conducted Elgar's orchestral version of "Salut d'amour" and the Suite in D at the Crystal Palace, and two publishers accepted some of Elgar's violin pieces, organ <a href="voluntary%20%28music%29">voluntaries</a>, and <a href="part%20song">part song</a>s. Some tantalising opportunities seemed to be within reach but vanished unexpectedly. For example, an offer from the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House, Covent Garden</a>, to run through some of his works was withdrawn at the last second when <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Sir Arthur Sullivan</a> arrived unannounced to rehearse some of his own music. Sullivan was horrified when Elgar later told him what had happened. Elgar's only important commission while in London came from his home city: the Worcester Festival Committee invited him to compose a short orchestral work for the 1890 Three Choirs Festival. The result is described by Diana McVeagh in the "Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians", as "his first major work, the assured and uninhibited "<a href="Froissart%20Overture%20%28Elgar%29">Froissart</a>"." Elgar conducted the first performance in Worcester in September 1890. For lack of other work, he was obliged to leave London in 1891 and return with his wife and child to Worcestershire, where he could earn a living conducting local musical ensembles and teaching. They settled in Alice's former home town, <a href="Great%20Malvern">Great Malvern</a>.

During the 1890s, Elgar gradually built up a reputation as a composer, chiefly of works for the great choral festivals of the <a href="English%20Midlands">English Midlands</a>. "The Black Knight" (1892) and "King Olaf" (1896), both inspired by <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Longfellow</a>, "The Light of Life" (1896) and "Caractacus" (1898) were all modestly successful, and he obtained a long-standing publisher in <a href="Novello%20and%20Co">Novello and Co</a>. Other works of this decade included the "<a href="Serenade%20for%20Strings%20%28Elgar%29">Serenade for Strings</a>" (1892) and "<a href="Three%20Bavarian%20Dances">Three Bavarian Dances</a>" (1897). Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer <a href="Samuel%20Coleridge-Taylor">Samuel Coleridge-Taylor</a> to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped establish the younger man's career. Elgar was catching the attention of prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was "very sick at heart over music" and hoped to find a way to succeed with a larger work. His friend <a href="August%20Jaeger">August Jaeger</a> tried to lift his spirits: "A day's attack of the blues ... will not drive away your desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has given you. Your time of universal recognition will come."
In 1899, that prediction suddenly came true. At the age of forty-two, Elgar produced the "<a href="Enigma%20Variations">Enigma Variations</a>", which were premiered in London under the baton of the eminent German conductor <a href="Hans%20Richter%20%28conductor%29">Hans Richter</a>. In Elgar's own words, "I have sketched a set of Variations on an original theme. The Variations have amused me because I've labelled them with the nicknames of my particular friends ... that is to say I've written the variations each one to represent the mood of the 'party' (the person) ... and have written what I think they would have written – if they were asses enough to compose". He dedicated the work "To my friends pictured within". Probably the best known variation is "Nimrod", depicting Jaeger. Purely musical considerations led Elgar to omit variations depicting Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, whose styles he tried but failed to incorporate in the variations. The large-scale work was received with general acclaim for its originality, charm and craftsmanship, and it established Elgar as the pre-eminent British composer of his generation.

The work is formally titled "Variations on an Original Theme"; the word "Enigma" appears over the first six bars of music, which led to the familiar version of the title. The enigma is that, although there are fourteen variations on the "original theme", there is another overarching theme, never identified by Elgar, which he said "runs through and over the whole set" but is never heard. Later commentators have observed that although Elgar is today regarded as a characteristically English composer, his orchestral music and this work in particular share much with the Central European tradition typified at the time by the work of <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>. The "Enigma Variations" were well received in Germany and Italy, and remain to the present day a worldwide concert staple.

Elgar's biographer Basil Maine commented, "When Sir Arthur Sullivan died in 1900 it became apparent to many that Elgar, although a composer of another build, was his true successor as first musician of the land." Elgar's next major work was eagerly awaited. For the <a href="Birmingham%20Triennial%20Music%20Festival">Birmingham Triennial Music Festival</a> of 1900, he set Cardinal <a href="John%20Henry%20Newman">John Henry Newman</a>'s poem "<a href="The%20Dream%20of%20Gerontius">The Dream of Gerontius</a>" for soloists, chorus and orchestra. Richter conducted the premiere, which was marred by a poorly prepared chorus, which sang badly. Critics recognised the mastery of the piece despite the defects in performance. It was performed in <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, Germany, in 1901 and again in 1902, conducted by <a href="Julius%20Buths">Julius Buths</a>, who also conducted the European premiere of the "Enigma Variations" in 1901. The German press was enthusiastic. "The Cologne Gazette" said, "In both parts we meet with beauties of imperishable value. ... Elgar stands on the shoulders of Berlioz, Wagner, and <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a>, from whose influences he has freed himself until he has become an important individuality. He is one of the leaders of musical art of modern times." "The Düsseldorfer Volksblatt" wrote, "A memorable and epoch-making first performance! Since the days of Liszt nothing has been produced in the way of oratorio ... which reaches the greatness and importance of this sacred cantata." Richard Strauss, then widely viewed as the leading composer of his day, was so impressed that in Elgar's presence he proposed a toast to the success of "the first English progressive musician, Meister Elgar." Performances in Vienna, Paris and New York followed, and "The Dream of Gerontius" soon became equally admired in Britain. According to Kennedy, "It is unquestionably the greatest British work in the oratorio form ... [it] opened a new chapter in the English choral tradition and liberated it from its Handelian preoccupation." Elgar, as a Roman Catholic, was much moved by Newman's poem about the death and redemption of a sinner, but some influential members of the Anglican establishment disagreed. His colleague, <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a> complained that the work "stinks of incense". The <a href="Dean%20%28Christianity%29">Dean</a> of <a href="Gloucester%20Cathedral">Gloucester</a> banned "Gerontius" from his cathedral in 1901, and at Worcester the following year, the Dean insisted on expurgations before allowing a performance.
Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five "<a href="Pomp%20and%20Circumstance%20Marches">Pomp and Circumstance Marches</a>", which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the <a href="Last%20Night%20of%20the%20Proms">Last Night of the Proms</a>, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the "<a href="Ternary%20form">trio</a>") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, "I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by <a href="Henry%20Wood">Henry J. Wood</a>, who later wrote that the audience "rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore." To mark the <a href="coronation%20of%20King%20Edward%20VII%20and%20Queen%20Alexandra">coronation of Edward VII</a>, Elgar was commissioned to set <a href="A.%20C.%20Benson">A. C. Benson</a>'s "Coronation Ode" for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">king</a> was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The <a href="contralto">contralto</a> <a href="Clara%20Butt">Clara Butt</a> had persuaded him that the trio of the first "Pomp and Circumstance" march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, "Land of Hope and Glory", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as "Pomp and Circumstance" or "The Graduation March", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.

In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" commented, "Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his mind." The king and <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">queen</a> attended the first concert, at which Richter conducted "The Dream of Gerontius", and returned the next evening for the second, the London premiere of "<a href="The%20Apostles%20%28Elgar%29">The Apostles</a>" (first heard the previous year at the Birmingham Festival). The final concert of the festival, conducted by Elgar, was primarily orchestral, apart for an excerpt from "Caractacus" and the complete "<a href="Sea%20Pictures">Sea Pictures</a>" (sung by Clara Butt). The orchestral items were "Froissart", the "Enigma Variations", "<a href="Cockaigne%20%28In%20London%20Town%29">Cockaigne</a>", the first two (at that time the only two) "Pomp and Circumstance" marches, and the premiere of a new orchestral work, "<a href="In%20the%20South%20%28Alassio%29">In the South</a>", inspired by a holiday in Italy.
Elgar was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The following month, he and his family moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of <a href="Hereford">Hereford</a>, overlooking the <a href="River%20Wye">River Wye</a>, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a>. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend <a href="Granville%20Bantock">Granville Bantock</a> in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." Both <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a> sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> had Shaw been willing.

Elgar's principal composition in 1905 was the "<a href="Introduction%20and%20Allegro%20%28Elgar%29">Introduction and Allegro for Strings</a>", dedicated to <a href="Samuel%20Sanford">Samuel Sanford</a>, professor at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>. Elgar visited America in that year to conduct his music and to accept a doctorate from Yale. His next large-scale work was the sequel to "The Apostles" – the oratorio "<a href="The%20Kingdom%20%28Elgar%29">The Kingdom</a>" (1906). It was well received but did not catch the public imagination as "The Dream of Gerontius" had done and continued to do. Among keen Elgarians, however, "The Kingdom" was sometimes preferred to the earlier work: Elgar's friend <a href="Leo%20Frank%20Schuster">Frank Schuster</a> told the young <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Adrian Boult</a>: "compared with "The Kingdom", "Gerontius" is the work of a raw amateur." As Elgar approached his fiftieth birthday, he began work on his first symphony, a project that had been in his mind in various forms for nearly ten years. His <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Elgar%29">First Symphony</a> (1908) was a national and international triumph. Within weeks of the premiere it was performed in New York under <a href="Walter%20Damrosch">Walter Damrosch</a>, Vienna under <a href="Ferdinand%20L%C3%B6we">Ferdinand Löwe</a>, St. Petersburg under <a href="Alexander%20Siloti">Alexander Siloti</a>, and Leipzig under <a href="Arthur%20Nikisch">Arthur Nikisch</a>. There were performances in Rome, Chicago, Boston, Toronto and fifteen British towns and cities. In just over a year, it received a hundred performances in Britain, America and continental Europe.
The <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Elgar%29">Violin Concerto</a> (1910) was commissioned by <a href="Fritz%20Kreisler">Fritz Kreisler</a>, one of the leading international violinists of the time. Elgar wrote it during the summer of 1910, with occasional help from W. H. Reed, the leader of the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>, who helped the composer with advice on technical points. Elgar and Reed formed a firm friendship, which lasted for the rest of Elgar's life. Reed's biography, "Elgar As I Knew Him" (1936), records many details of Elgar's methods of composition. The work was presented by the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a>, with Kreisler and the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by the composer. Reed recalled, "the Concerto proved to be a complete triumph, the concert a brilliant and unforgettable occasion." So great was the impact of the concerto that Kreisler's rival <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Ysa%C3%BFe">Eugène Ysaÿe</a> spent much time with Elgar going through the work. There was great disappointment when contractual difficulties prevented Ysaÿe from playing it in London.

The Violin Concerto was Elgar's last popular triumph. The following year he presented his <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Elgar%29">Second Symphony</a> in London, but was disappointed at its reception. Unlike the First Symphony, it ends not in a blaze of orchestral splendour but quietly and contemplatively. Reed, who played at the premiere, later wrote that Elgar was recalled to the platform several times to acknowledge the applause, "but missed that unmistakable note perceived when an audience, even an English audience, is thoroughly roused or worked up, as it was after the Violin Concerto or the First Symphony." Elgar asked Reed, "What is the matter with them, Billy? They sit there like a lot of stuffed pigs." The work was, by normal standards, a success, with twenty-seven performances within three years of its premiere, but it did not achieve the international "furore" of the First Symphony.

In June 1911, as part of the celebrations surrounding the <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">coronation</a> of <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a>, Elgar was appointed to the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a>, an honour limited to twenty-four holders at any time. The following year, the Elgars moved back to London, to a large house in Netherhall Gardens, <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, designed by <a href="Richard%20Norman%20Shaw">Norman Shaw</a>. There Elgar composed his last two large-scale works of the pre-war era, the choral ode, "The Music Makers" (for the Birmingham Festival, 1912) and the symphonic study "<a href="Falstaff%20%28Elgar%29">Falstaff</a>" (for the Leeds Festival, 1913). Both were received politely but without enthusiasm. Even the dedicatee of "Falstaff", the conductor <a href="Landon%20Ronald">Landon Ronald</a>, confessed privately that he could not "make head or tail of the piece," while the musical scholar <a href="Percy%20Scholes">Percy Scholes</a> wrote of "Falstaff" that it was a "great work" but, "so far as public appreciation goes, a comparative failure."

When World War I broke out, Elgar was horrified at the prospect of the carnage, but his patriotic feelings were nonetheless aroused. He composed "A Song for Soldiers", which he later withdrew. He signed up as a special constable in the local police and later joined the Hampstead Volunteer Reserve of the army. He composed patriotic works, "<a href="Carillon%20%28Elgar%29">Carillon</a>", a recitation for speaker and orchestra in honour of Belgium, and "<a href="Polonia%20%28Elgar%29">Polonia</a>", an orchestral piece in honour of Poland. "Land of Hope and Glory", already popular, became still more so, and Elgar wished in vain to have new, less nationalistic, words sung to the tune.
Elgar's other compositions during the war included <a href="incidental%20music">incidental music</a> for a children's play, "<a href="The%20Starlight%20Express">The Starlight Express</a>" (1915); a ballet, "<a href="The%20Sanguine%20Fan">The Sanguine Fan</a>" (1917); and "<a href="The%20Spirit%20of%20England">The Spirit of England</a>" (1915–17, to poems by <a href="Laurence%20Binyon">Laurence Binyon</a>), three choral settings very different in character from the romantic patriotism of his earlier years. His last large-scale composition of the war years was "<a href="The%20Fringes%20of%20the%20Fleet">The Fringes of the Fleet</a>", settings of verses by <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, performed with great popular success around the country, until Kipling for unexplained reasons objected to their performance in theatres. Elgar conducted a recording of the work for the <a href="Gramophone%20Company">Gramophone Company</a>.

Towards the end of the war, Elgar was in poor health. His wife thought it best for him to move to the countryside, and she rented 'Brinkwells', a house near <a href="Fittleworth">Fittleworth</a> in Sussex, from the painter <a href="Rex%20Vicat%20Cole">Rex Vicat Cole</a>. There Elgar recovered his strength and, in 1918 and 1919, he produced four large-scale works. The first three of these were <a href="chamber%20music">chamber pieces</a>: the <a href="Violin%20Sonata%20%28Elgar%29">Violin Sonata in E minor</a>, the <a href="Piano%20Quintet%20%28Elgar%29">Piano Quintet in A minor</a>, and the <a href="String%20Quartet%20%28Elgar%29">String Quartet in E minor</a>. On hearing the work in progress, Alice Elgar wrote in her diary, "E. writing wonderful new music". All three works were well received. "The Times" wrote, "Elgar's sonata contains much that we have heard before in other forms, but as we do not at all want him to change and be somebody else, that is as it should be." The quartet and quintet were premiered at the <a href="Wigmore%20Hall">Wigmore Hall</a> on 21 May 1919. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" wrote, "This quartet, with its tremendous climaxes, curious refinements of dance-rhythms, and its perfect symmetry, and the quintet, more lyrical and passionate, are as perfect examples of chamber music as the great oratorios were of their type."

By contrast, the remaining work, the <a href="Cello%20Concerto%20%28Elgar%29">Cello Concerto in E minor</a>, had a disastrous premiere, at the opening concert of the London Symphony Orchestra's 1919–20 season in October 1919. Apart from the Elgar work, which the composer conducted, the rest of the programme was conducted by <a href="Albert%20Coates%20%28musician%29">Albert Coates</a>, who overran his rehearsal time at the expense of Elgar's. Lady Elgar wrote, "that brutal selfish ill-mannered bounder ... that brute Coates went on rehearsing." The critic of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a>, wrote, "There have been rumours about during the week of inadequate rehearsal. Whatever the explanation, the sad fact remains that never, in all probability, has so great an orchestra made so lamentable an exhibition of itself. ... The work itself is lovely stuff, very simple – that pregnant simplicity that has come upon Elgar's music in the last couple of years – but with a profound wisdom and beauty underlying its simplicity." Elgar attached no blame to his soloist, <a href="Felix%20Salmond">Felix Salmond</a>, who played for him again later, including at the inaugural concert of the City of Birmingham Orchestra (later <a href="City%20of%20Birmingham%20Symphony%20Orchestra">City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra</a>), which Elgar conducted. In contrast with the First Symphony and its hundred performances in just over a year, the Cello Concerto did not have a second performance in London for more than a year.

Although in the 1920s Elgar's music was no longer in fashion, his admirers continued to present his works when possible. Reed singles out a performance of the Second Symphony in March 1920 conducted by "a young man almost unknown to the public", Adrian Boult, for bringing "the grandeur and nobility of the work" to a wider public. Also in 1920, Landon Ronald presented an all-Elgar concert at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a>. Alice Elgar wrote with enthusiasm about the reception of the symphony, but this was one of the last times she heard Elgar's music played in public. After a short illness, she died of lung cancer on 7 April 1920, at the age of seventy-two.

Elgar was devastated by the loss of his wife. With no public demand for new works, and deprived of Alice's constant support and inspiration, he allowed himself to be deflected from composition. His daughter later wrote that Elgar inherited from his father a reluctance to "settle down to work on hand but could cheerfully spend hours over some perfectly unnecessary and entirely unremunerative undertaking", a trait that became stronger after Alice's death. For much of the rest of his life, Elgar indulged himself in his several hobbies. Throughout his life he was a keen <a href="amateur%20chemist">amateur chemist</a>, sometimes using a laboratory in his back garden. He even patented the "Elgar Sulphuretted Hydrogen Apparatus" in 1908. He enjoyed <a href="Association%20football">football</a>, supporting <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.</a>, for whom he composed an anthem, ""He Banged the Leather for Goal"", and in his later years he frequently attended horseraces. His protégés, the conductor <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a> and violinist <a href="Yehudi%20Menuhin">Yehudi Menuhin</a>, both recalled rehearsals with Elgar at which he swiftly satisfied himself that all was well and then went off to the races. In his younger days, Elgar had been an enthusiastic cyclist, buying Royal Sunbeam bicycles for himself and his wife in 1903 (he named his "Mr. <a href="Phoebus">Phoebus</a>"). As an elderly widower, he enjoyed being driven about the countryside by his chauffeur. In November and December 1923, he took a voyage to Brazil, journeying up the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon</a> to <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a>, where he was impressed by its opera house, the <a href="Amazon%20Theatre">Teatro Amazonas</a>. Almost nothing is recorded about Elgar's activities or the events that he encountered during the trip, which gave the novelist <a href="James%20Hamilton-Paterson">James Hamilton-Paterson</a> considerable latitude when writing "Gerontius", a fictional account of the journey.

After Alice's death, Elgar sold the Hampstead house, and after living for a short time in a flat in <a href="St%20James%27s">St James's</a> in the heart of London, he moved back to Worcestershire, to the village of <a href="Kempsey%2C%20Worcestershire">Kempsey</a>, where he lived from 1923 to 1927. He did not wholly abandon composition in these years. He made large-scale symphonic arrangements of works by <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a> and <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a> and wrote his "Empire March" and eight songs "<a href="Pageant%20of%20Empire%20%28Elgar%29">Pageant of Empire</a>" for the 1924 <a href="British%20Empire%20Exhibition">British Empire Exhibition</a>. Shortly after these were published, he was appointed <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Queen%27s%20Music">Master of the King's Musick</a> on 13 May 1924, following the death of <a href="Walter%20Parratt">Sir Walter Parratt</a>.

From 1926 onwards, Elgar made a series of recordings of his own works. Described by the music writer Robert Philip as "the first composer to take the gramophone seriously", he had already recorded much of his music by the early acoustic-recording process for <a href="Gramophone%20Company">His Master's Voice (HMV)</a> from 1914 onwards, but the introduction of electrical microphones in 1925 transformed the gramophone from a novelty into a realistic medium for reproducing orchestral and choral music. Elgar was the first composer to take full advantage of this technological advance. <a href="Fred%20Gaisberg">Fred Gaisberg</a> of HMV, who produced Elgar's recordings, set up a series of sessions to capture on disc the composer's interpretations of his major orchestral works, including the "Enigma Variations", "Falstaff", the first and second symphonies, and the cello and violin concertos. For most of these, the orchestra was the LSO, but the "Variations" were played by the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra. Later in the series of recordings, Elgar also conducted two newly founded orchestras, Boult's <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Sir Thomas Beecham</a>'s <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a>.

Elgar's recordings were released on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA Victor</a>. After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on <a href="LP%20record">LP</a>, but the other recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.

In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by <a href="Path%C3%A9">Pathé</a> for a newsreel depicting a recording session of "Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1" at the opening of EMI's <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> in London. It is believed to be the only surviving sound film of Elgar, who makes a brief remark before conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, asking the musicians to "play this tune as though you've never heard it before." A memorial plaque to Elgar at Abbey Road was unveiled on 24 June 1993.

A late piece of Elgar's, the "<a href="Nursery%20Suite">Nursery Suite</a>", was an early example of a studio premiere: its first performance was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Duke of York</a>, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books.

In his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932. He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Frederick Delius</a> at his house at <a href="Grez-sur-Loing">Grez-sur-Loing</a>. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and <a href="John%20Barbirolli">John Barbirolli</a>, who championed his music when it was out of fashion. He began work on an opera, "The Spanish Lady", and accepted a commission from the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> to compose a <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Elgar/Payne%29">Third Symphony</a>. His final illness, however, prevented their completion. He fretted about the unfinished works. He asked Reed to ensure that nobody would "tinker" with the sketches and attempt a completion of the symphony, but at other times he said, "If I can't complete the Third Symphony, somebody will complete it – or write a better one." After Elgar's death, <a href="Percy%20M.%20Young">Percy M. Young</a>, in co-operation with the BBC and Elgar's daughter Carice, produced a version of "The Spanish Lady", which was issued on CD. The Third Symphony sketches were elaborated by the composer <a href="Anthony%20Payne">Anthony Payne</a> into a complete score in 1998.

Inoperable <a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a> was discovered during an operation on 8 October 1933. He told his consulting doctor, <a href="Arthur%20Thomson%20%28physician%29">Arthur Thomson</a>, that he had no faith in an <a href="afterlife">afterlife</a>: "I believe there is nothing but complete oblivion." Elgar died on 23 February 1934 at the age of seventy-six and was buried next to his wife at St. Wulstan's Roman Catholic Church in <a href="Little%20Malvern">Little Malvern</a>. 

Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling <a href="William%20Byrd">William Byrd</a> and his contemporaries "museum pieces". Of later English composers, he regarded <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Purcell</a> as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvořák and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's <a href="chromaticism">chromaticism</a>, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Massenet</a>, Saint-Saëns and, particularly, <a href="L%C3%A9o%20Delibes">Delibes</a>, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.

Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in "Grove's Dictionary" finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except "<a href="Salut%20d%27Amour">Salut d'Amour</a>" and (as arranged decades later into "<a href="The%20Wand%20of%20Youth">The Wand of Youth</a>" Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture "<a href="Froissart%20Overture%20%28Elgar%29">Froissart</a>", was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a> and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the "<a href="Serenade%20for%20Strings%20%28Elgar%29">Serenade for Strings</a>" and "<a href="Three%20Bavarian%20Dances">Three Bavarian Dances</a>". In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong "The Snow", for female voices, and "<a href="Sea%20Pictures">Sea Pictures</a>", a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the repertory.

Elgar's principal large-scale early works were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were "The Black Knight", "King Olaf", "The Light of Life", "The Banner of St George" and "Caractacus". He also wrote a "Te Deum" and "Benedictus" for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s, but less favourably on the qualities of his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the "<a href="Enigma%20Variations">Enigma Variations</a>", appeared to be a sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade.

Elgar's best-known works were composed within the twenty-one years between 1899 and 1920. Most of them are orchestral. Reed wrote, "Elgar's genius rose to its greatest height in his orchestral works" and quoted the composer as saying that, even in his oratorios, the orchestral part is the most important. The "Enigma Variations" made Elgar's name nationally. The variation form was ideal for him at this stage of his career, when his comprehensive mastery of orchestration was still in contrast to his tendency to write his melodies in short, sometimes rigid, phrases. His next orchestral works, "<a href="Cockaigne%20%28In%20London%20Town%29">Cockaigne</a>", a concert-overture (1900–1901), the first two "<a href="Pomp%20and%20Circumstance%20Marches">Pomp and Circumstance</a>" marches (1901), and the gentle "<a href="Dream%20Children%20%28Elgar%29">Dream Children</a>" (1902), are all short: the longest of them, "Cockaigne", lasting less than fifteen minutes. "<a href="In%20the%20South%20%28Alassio%29">In the South</a>" (1903–1904), although designated by Elgar as a concert-overture, is, according to Kennedy, really a <a href="tone%20poem">tone poem</a> and the longest continuous piece of purely orchestral writing Elgar had essayed. He wrote it after setting aside an early attempt to compose a symphony. The work reveals his continuing progress in writing sustained themes and orchestral lines, although some critics, including Kennedy, find that in the middle part "Elgar's inspiration burns at less than its brightest." In 1905 Elgar completed the "<a href="Introduction%20and%20Allegro%20%28Elgar%29">Introduction and Allegro for Strings</a>". This work is based, unlike much of Elgar's earlier writing, not on a profusion of themes but on only three. Kennedy called it a "masterly composition, equalled among English works for strings only by <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Vaughan Williams</a>'s "<a href="Fantasia%20on%20a%20Theme%20by%20Thomas%20Tallis">Tallis Fantasia</a>"." Nevertheless, at less than a quarter of an hour, it was not by contemporary standards a lengthy composition. <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Mahler%29">Seventh Symphony</a>, composed at the same time, runs for well over an hour.

During the next four years, however, Elgar composed three major concert pieces, which, though shorter than comparable works by some of his European contemporaries, are among the most substantial such works by an English composer. These were his <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Elgar%29">First Symphony</a>, <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Elgar%29">Violin Concerto</a>, and <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Elgar%29">Second Symphony</a>, which all play for between forty-five minutes and an hour. McVeagh says of the symphonies that they "rank high not only in Elgar's output but in English musical history. Both are long and powerful, without published programmes, only hints and quotations to indicate some inward drama from which they derive their vitality and eloquence. Both are based on classical form but differ from it to the extent that ... they were considered prolix and slackly constructed by some critics. Certainly the invention in them is copious; each symphony would need several dozen music examples to chart its progress."
Elgar's Violin Concerto and <a href="Cello%20Concerto%20%28Elgar%29">Cello Concerto</a>, in the view of Kennedy, "rank not only among his finest works, but among the greatest of their kind". They are, however, very different from each other. The Violin Concerto, composed in 1909 as Elgar reached the height of his popularity, and written for the instrument dearest to his heart, is lyrical throughout and rhapsodical and brilliant by turns. The Cello Concerto, composed a decade later, immediately after World War I, seems, in Kennedy's words, "to belong to another age, another world ... the simplest of all Elgar's major works ... also the least grandiloquent." Between the two concertos came Elgar's symphonic study "<a href="Falstaff%20%28Elgar%29">Falstaff</a>", which has divided opinion even among Elgar's strongest admirers. <a href="Donald%20Tovey">Donald Tovey</a> viewed it as "one of the immeasurably great things in music", with power "identical with Shakespeare's", while Kennedy criticises the work for "too frequent reliance on <a href="Sequence%20%28music%29">sequences</a>" and an over-idealised depiction of the female characters. Reed thought that the principal themes show less distinction than some of Elgar's earlier works. Elgar himself thought "Falstaff" the highest point of his purely orchestral work.

The major works for voices and orchestra of the twenty-one years of Elgar's middle period are three large-scale works for soloists, chorus and orchestra: "<a href="The%20Dream%20of%20Gerontius">The Dream of Gerontius</a>" (1900), and the oratorios "<a href="The%20Apostles%20%28Elgar%29">The Apostles</a>" (1903) and "<a href="The%20Kingdom%20%28Elgar%29">The Kingdom</a>" (1906); and two shorter odes, the "<a href="Coronation%20Ode">Coronation Ode</a>" (1902) and "<a href="The%20Music%20Makers%20%28Elgar%29">The Music Makers</a>" (1912). The first of the odes, as a "pièce d'occasion", has rarely been revived after its initial success, with the culminating "Land of Hope and Glory". The second is, for Elgar, unusual in that it contains several quotations from his earlier works, as Richard Strauss quoted himself in "<a href="Ein%20Heldenleben">Ein Heldenleben</a>". The choral works were all successful, although the first, "Gerontius", was and remains the best-loved and most performed. On the manuscript Elgar wrote, quoting <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a>, "This is the best of me; for the rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another. My life was as the vapour, and is not; but this I saw, and knew; this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory." All three of the large-scale works follow the traditional model with sections for soloists, chorus and both together. Elgar's distinctive orchestration, as well as his melodic inspiration, lifts them to a higher level than most of their British predecessors.

Elgar's other works of his middle period include incidental music for "<a href="Diarmuid%20and%20Grania">Grania and Diarmid</a>", a play by <a href="George%20Moore%20%28novelist%29">George Moore</a> and <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a> (1901), and for "<a href="The%20Starlight%20Express">The Starlight Express</a>", a play based on a story by <a href="Algernon%20Blackwood">Algernon Blackwood</a> (1916). Of the former, Yeats called Elgar's music "wonderful in its heroic melancholy". Elgar also wrote a number of songs during his peak period, of which Reed observes, "it cannot be said that he enriched the vocal repertory to the same extent as he did that of the orchestra."

After the Cello Concerto, Elgar completed no more large-scale works. He made arrangements of works by Bach, Handel and <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a>, in distinctively Elgarian orchestration, and once again turned his youthful notebooks to use for the "<a href="Nursery%20Suite">Nursery Suite</a>" (1931). His other compositions of this period have not held a place in the regular repertory. For most of the rest of the twentieth century, it was generally agreed that Elgar's creative impulse ceased after his wife's death. Anthony Payne's elaboration of the sketches for Elgar's Third Symphony led to a reconsideration of this supposition. Elgar left the opening of the symphony complete in full score, and those pages, along with others, show Elgar's orchestration changed markedly from the richness of his pre-war work. "The Gramophone" described the opening of the new work as something "thrilling ... unforgettably gaunt". Payne also subsequently produced a performing version of the sketches for a sixth "Pomp and Circumstance March", premiered at <a href="the%20Proms">the Proms</a> in August 2006. Elgar's sketches for a piano concerto dating from 1913 were elaborated by the composer Robert Walker and first performed in August 1997 by the pianist <a href="David%20Owen%20Norris">David Owen Norris</a>. The realisation has since been extensively revised.

Views of Elgar's stature have varied in the decades since his music came to prominence at the beginning of the twentieth century. Richard Strauss, as noted, hailed Elgar as a progressive composer; even the hostile reviewer in "The Observer", unimpressed by the thematic material of the First Symphony in 1908, called the orchestration "magnificently modern". Hans Richter rated Elgar as "the greatest modern composer" in any country, and Richter's colleague Arthur Nikisch considered the First Symphony "a masterpiece of the first order" to be "justly ranked with the great symphonic models – Beethoven and Brahms." By contrast, the critic <a href="Walter%20J.%20Turner">W. J. Turner</a>, in the mid-twentieth century, wrote of Elgar's "<a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> symphonies," and <a href="Herbert%20von%20Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a> called the "Enigma Variations" "second-hand Brahms". Elgar's immense popularity was not long-lived. After the success of his First Symphony and Violin Concerto, his Second Symphony and Cello Concerto were politely received but without the earlier wild enthusiasm. His music was identified in the public mind with the <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian era</a>, and after the First World War he no longer seemed a progressive or modern composer. In the early 1920s, even the First Symphony had only one London performance in more than three years. <a href="Henry%20J.%20Wood">Henry Wood</a> and younger conductors such as Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli championed Elgar's music, but in the recording catalogues and the concert programmes of the middle of the century his works were not well represented.

In 1924, the music scholar <a href="Edward%20Joseph%20Dent">Edward J. Dent</a> wrote an article for a German music journal in which he identified four features of Elgar's style that gave offence to a section of English opinion (namely, Dent indicated, the academic and snobbish section): "too emotional", "not quite free from vulgarity", "pompous", and "too deliberately noble in expression". This article was reprinted in 1930 and caused controversy. In the later years of the century there was, in Britain at least, a revival of interest in Elgar's music. The features that had offended austere taste in the inter-war years were seen from a different perspective. In 1955, the reference book "<a href="The%20Record%20Guide">The Record Guide</a>" wrote of the Edwardian background during the height of Elgar's career:
By the 1960s, a less severe view was being taken of the Edwardian era. In 1966 the critic <a href="Frank%20Howes">Frank Howes</a> wrote that Elgar reflected the last blaze of opulence, expansiveness and full-blooded life, before World War I swept so much away. In Howes's view, there was a touch of vulgarity in both the era and Elgar's music, but "a composer is entitled to be judged by posterity for his best work. ... Elgar is historically important for giving to English music a sense of the orchestra, for expressing what it felt like to be alive in the Edwardian age, for conferring on the world at least four unqualified masterpieces, and for thereby restoring England to the comity of musical nations."
In 1967 the critic and analyst David Cox considered the question of the supposed Englishness of Elgar's music. Cox noted that Elgar disliked folk-songs and never used them in his works, opting for an idiom that was essentially German, leavened by a lightness derived from French composers including Berlioz and Gounod. How then, asked Cox, could Elgar be "the most English of composers"? Cox found the answer in Elgar's own personality, which "could use the alien idioms in such a way as to make of them a vital form of expression that was his and his alone. And the personality that comes through in the music is English." This point about Elgar's transmuting his influences had been touched on before. In 1930 "The Times" wrote, "When Elgar's first symphony came out, someone attempted to prove that its main tune on which all depends was like the Grail theme in Parsifal. ... but the attempt fell flat because everyone else, including those who disliked the tune, had instantly recognized it as typically 'Elgarian', while the Grail theme is as typically Wagnerian." As for Elgar's "Englishness", his fellow-composers recognised it: Richard Strauss and <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a> made particular reference to it, and <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a> called him, "the personification of the true English character in music ... a noble personality and a born aristocrat".

Among Elgar's admirers there is disagreement about which of his works are to be regarded as masterpieces. The "Enigma Variations" are generally counted among them. "The Dream of Gerontius" has also been given high praise by Elgarians, and the Cello Concerto is similarly rated. Many rate the Violin Concerto equally highly, but some do not. Sackville-West omitted it from the list of Elgar masterpieces in "The Record Guide", and in a long analytical article in "<a href="The%20Musical%20Quarterly">The Musical Quarterly</a>", <a href="Daniel%20Gregory%20Mason">Daniel Gregory Mason</a> criticised the first movement of the concerto for a "kind of sing-songiness ... as fatal to noble rhythm in music as it is in poetry." "Falstaff" also divides opinion. It has never been a great popular favourite, and Kennedy and Reed identify shortcomings in it. In a "Musical Times" 1957 centenary symposium on Elgar led by Vaughan Williams, by contrast, several contributors share <a href="Eric%20Blom">Eric Blom</a>'s view that "Falstaff" is the greatest of all Elgar's works.

The two symphonies divide opinion even more sharply. Mason rates the Second poorly for its "over-obvious rhythmic scheme", but calls the First "Elgar's masterpiece. ... It is hard to see how any candid student can deny the greatness of this symphony." However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, several leading admirers of Elgar express reservations about one or both symphonies. In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">The Gramophone</a>", "For some reason few people seem to like the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they are more than a little bored by the rival work." The critic <a href="John%20Warrack">John Warrack</a> wrote, "There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief", whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and "angst" and is marked instead by a "benevolent tranquillity."

Despite the fluctuating critical assessment of the various works over the years, Elgar's major works taken as a whole have in the twenty-first century recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s. "The Record Guide" in 1955 could list only one currently available recording of the First Symphony, none of the Second, one of the Violin Concerto, two of the Cello Concerto, two of the "Enigma Variations", one of "Falstaff", and none of "The Dream of Gerontius". Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works. More than thirty recordings have been made of the First Symphony since 1955, for example, and more than a dozen of "The Dream of Gerontius". Similarly, in the concert hall, Elgar's works, after a period of neglect, are once again frequently programmed. The <a href="Elgar%20Society">Elgar Society</a>'s website, in its diary of forthcoming performances, lists performances of Elgar's works by orchestras, soloists and conductors across Europe, North America and Australia.

Elgar was knighted in 1904, and in 1911 he was appointed a member of the Order of Merit. In 1920 he received the Cross of Commander of the Belgian <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20%28Belgium%29">Order of the Crown</a>; in 1924 he was made Master of the King's Musick; the following year he received the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society; and in 1928 he was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander">Knight Commander</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Royal Victorian Order</a> (KCVO). Between 1900 and 1931, Elgar received honorary degrees from the Universities of <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, <a href="Durham%20University">Durham</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Leeds">Leeds</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a>, <a href="Yale">Yale</a> (USA), <a href="University%20of%20Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh">Western Pennsylvania</a> (USA), Birmingham and <a href="University%20of%20London">London</a>. Foreign academies of which he was made a member were Regia <a href="Accademia%20di%20Santa%20Cecilia">Accademia di Santa Cecilia</a>, Rome; Accademia del Reale Istituto Musicale, Florence; <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20des%20Beaux%20Arts">Académie des Beaux Arts</a>, Paris; <a href="Institut%20de%20France">Institut de France</a>; and the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy</a>. In 1931 he was created a <a href="Baronet">Baronet</a>, of Broadheath in the County of Worcester. In 1933 he was promoted within the Royal Victorian Order to Knight Grand Cross (GCVO). In Kennedy's words, he "shamelessly touted" for a <a href="peerage">peerage</a>, but in vain. In "Who's Who", post World War I, he claimed to have been awarded "several <a href="Russian%20Empire">Imperial Russian</a> and German decorations (lapsed)".

Elgar was offered, but declined, the office of Mayor of Hereford (despite not being a member of its city council) when he lived in the city in 1905. The same year he was made an honorary Freeman of the city of Worcester.

The house in Lower Broadheath where Elgar was born is now the <a href="Elgar%20Birthplace%20Museum">Elgar Birthplace Museum</a>, devoted to his life and work. Elgar's daughter, Carice, helped to found the museum in 1936 and bequeathed to it much of her collection of Elgar's letters and documents on her death in 1970. Carice left Elgar manuscripts to musical colleges: "The Black Knight" to <a href="Trinity%20College%20of%20Music">Trinity College of Music</a>; "King Olaf" to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a>; "The Music Makers" to Birmingham University; the Cello Concerto to the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a>; "The Kingdom" to the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a>; and other manuscripts to the <a href="British%20Library">British Museum</a>. The Elgar Society dedicated to the composer and his works was formed in 1951. The University of Birmingham's Special Collections contain an archive of letters written by Elgar.

Elgar's statue at the end of Worcester High Street stands facing the cathedral, only yards from where his father's shop once stood. Another statue of the composer by <a href="Rose%20Garrard">Rose Garrard</a> is at the top of Church Street in <a href="Malvern%2C%20Worcestershire">Malvern</a>, overlooking the town and giving visitors an opportunity to stand next to the composer in the shadow of the Hills that he so often regarded. In September 2005, a third statue sculpted by Jemma Pearson was unveiled near <a href="Hereford%20Cathedral">Hereford Cathedral</a> in honour of his many musical and other associations with the city. It depicts Elgar with his bicycle. From 1999 until early 2007, new <a href="British%20banknotes">Bank of England twenty pound notes</a> featured a portrait of Elgar. The change to remove his image generated controversy, particularly because 2007 was the 150th anniversary of Elgar's birth. From 2007 the Elgar notes were phased out, ceasing to be <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> on 30 June 2010.

There are around 65 roads in the UK named after Elgar, including six in the counties of <a href="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a> and <a href="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>. Elgar had three locomotives named in his honour.
Elgar's life and music have inspired works of literature including the novel "Gerontius" and several plays. "Elgar's Rondo", a 1993 stage play by <a href="David%20Pownall">David Pownall</a> depicts the dead Jaeger offering ghostly advice on Elgar's musical development. Pownall also wrote a radio play, "Elgar's Third" (1994); another Elgar-themed radio play is <a href="Alick%20Rowe">Alick Rowe</a>'s "The Dorabella Variation" (2003). <a href="David%20Rudkin">David Rudkin</a>'s BBC television "<a href="Play%20for%20Today">Play for Today</a>" "<a href="Penda%27s%20Fen">Penda's Fen</a>" (1974) deals with themes including sex and adolescence, spying, and snobbery, with Elgar's music, chiefly "The Dream of Gerontius", as its background. In one scene, a ghostly Elgar whispers the secret of the "Enigma" tune to the youthful central character, with an injunction not to reveal it. "Elgar on the Journey to Hanley", a novel by <a href="Keith%20Alldritt">Keith Alldritt</a> (1979), tells of the composer's attachment to Dora Penny, later Mrs Powell, (depicted as "Dorabella" in the "Enigma Variations"), and covers the fifteen years from their first meeting in the mid-1890s to the genesis of the Violin Concerto when, in the novel, Dora has been supplanted in Elgar's affections by Alice Stuart-Wortley.

Perhaps the best-known work depicting Elgar is <a href="Ken%20Russell">Ken Russell</a>'s 1962 BBC television film "<a href="Elgar%20%28film%29">Elgar</a>", made when the composer was still largely out of fashion. This hour-long film contradicted the view of Elgar as a jingoistic and bombastic composer, and evoked the more pastoral and melancholy side of his character and music.

The following have been selected as representative of Elgar's works, based on quality, significance and popularity.

Edward VI of England

Edward VI (12 October 1537 – 6 July 1553) was <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a> and <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> from 28 January 1547 until his death. He was crowned on 20 February at the age of nine. Edward was the son of <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a> and <a href="Jane%20Seymour">Jane Seymour</a>, and England's first monarch to be raised as a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>. During his reign, the realm was governed by a <a href="regent">regency</a> council because he never reached his majority. The council was first led by his uncle <a href="Edward%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset</a> (1547–1549), and then by <a href="John%20Dudley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">John Dudley, 1st Earl of Warwick</a> (1550–1553), who from 1551 was <a href="Duke%20of%20Northumberland">Duke of Northumberland</a>.

Edward's reign was marked by economic problems and social unrest that in 1549 erupted into riot and rebellion. An expensive war with <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a>, at first successful, ended with military withdrawal from Scotland and <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne-sur-Mer</a> in exchange for peace. The transformation of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> into a recognisably Protestant body also occurred under Edward, who took great interest in religious matters. Although his father, HenryVIII, had severed the link between the Church and <a href="Catholic%20Church">Rome</a>, HenryVIII had never permitted the renunciation of <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> doctrine or ceremony. It was during Edward's reign that Protestantism was <a href="Christian%20state">established</a> for the first time in England with reforms that included the abolition of <a href="clerical%20celibacy">clerical celibacy</a> and the <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a>, and the imposition of compulsory services in English.

In February 1553, at age 15, Edward fell ill. When his sickness was discovered to be terminal, he and his Council drew up a "Devise for the Succession", to prevent the country's return to Catholicism. Edward named his <a href="Cousin%23Relationship%20charts">first cousin once removed</a>, <a href="Lady%20Jane%20Grey">Lady Jane Grey</a>, as his heir, excluding his half-sisters, <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth</a>. This decision was disputed following Edward's death, and Jane was deposed by Mary nine days after becoming queen. During her reign, Mary reversed Edward's Protestant reforms, which nonetheless became the basis of the <a href="Elizabethan%20Religious%20Settlement">Elizabethan Religious Settlement</a> of 1559.

Edward was born on 12 October 1537 in his mother's room inside <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace">Hampton Court Palace</a>, in <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a>. He was the son of King <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a> by his third wife, <a href="Jane%20Seymour">Jane Seymour</a>. Throughout the realm, the people greeted the birth of a male heir, "whom we hungered for so long", with joy and relief. "<a href="Te%20Deum">Te Deum</a>s" were sung in churches, bonfires lit, and "their was shott at the Tower that night above two thousand gonnes". Queen Jane, appearing to recover quickly from the birth, sent out personally signed letters announcing the birth of "a Prince, conceived in most lawful matrimony between my Lord the King's Majesty and us". Edward was <a href="Infant%20baptism">christened</a> on 15 October, with his half-sisters, the 21-year-old <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Lady Mary</a> as godmother and the 4-year-old <a href="Elizabeth%20I">Lady Elizabeth</a> carrying the <a href="chrisom">chrisom</a>; and the <a href="Garter%20Principal%20King%20of%20Arms">Garter King of Arms</a> proclaimed him as <a href="Duke%20of%20Cornwall">Duke of Cornwall</a> and <a href="Earl%20of%20Chester">Earl of Chester</a>. The Queen, however, fell ill on 23 October from presumed postnatal complications, and died the following night. Henry VIII wrote to <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">Francis I of France</a> that "Divine Providence ... hath mingled my joy with bitterness of the death of her who brought me this happiness".

Edward was a healthy baby who suckled strongly from the outset. His father was delighted with him; in May 1538, Henry was observed "dallying with him in his arms ... and so holding him in a window to the sight and great comfort of the people". That September, the Lord Chancellor, <a href="Thomas%20Audley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Audley%20of%20Walden">Lord Audley</a>, reported Edward's rapid growth and vigour; and other accounts describe him as a tall and merry child. The tradition that Edward VI was a sickly boy has been challenged by more recent historians. At the age of four, he fell ill with a life-threatening "<a href="quartan%20fever">quartan fever</a>", but, despite occasional illnesses and poor eyesight, he enjoyed generally good health until the last six months of his life.

Edward was initially placed in the care of <a href="Margaret%20Bryan">Margaret Bryan</a>, "lady mistress" of the prince's household. She was succeeded by Blanche Herbert, <a href="Lady%20Troy">Lady Troy</a>. Until the age of six, Edward was brought up, as he put it later in his "Chronicle", "among the women". The formal royal household established around Edward was, at first, under <a href="Sir%20William%20Sidney">Sir William Sidney</a>, and later Sir Richard Page, stepfather of <a href="Edward%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Edward Seymour</a>'s wife, <a href="Anne%20Stanhope">Anne Stanhope</a>. Henry demanded exacting standards of security and cleanliness in his son's household, stressing that Edward was "this whole realm's most precious jewel". Visitors described the prince, who was lavishly provided with toys and comforts, including his own troupe of <a href="minstrel">minstrel</a>s, as a contented child.

From the age of six, Edward began his formal education under <a href="Richard%20Cox%20%28bishop%29">Richard Cox</a> and <a href="John%20Cheke">John Cheke</a>, concentrating, as he recalled himself, on "learning of tongues, of the scripture, of philosophy, and all liberal sciences". He received tuition from Elizabeth's tutor, <a href="Roger%20Ascham">Roger Ascham</a>, and <a href="Jean%20Belmain">Jean Belmain</a>, learning French, Spanish and Italian. In addition, he is known to have studied <a href="geometry">geometry</a> and learned to play musical instruments, including the <a href="lute">lute</a> and the <a href="virginals">virginals</a>. He collected globes and maps and, according to coinage historian C. E. Challis, developed a grasp of monetary affairs that indicated a high intelligence. Edward's religious education is assumed to have favoured the reforming agenda. His religious establishment was probably chosen by <a href="Archbishop%20Thomas%20Cranmer">Archbishop Thomas Cranmer</a>, a leading reformer. Both Cox and Cheke were "reformed" Catholics or <a href="Erasmians">Erasmians</a> and later became <a href="Marian%20exiles">Marian exiles</a>. By 1549, Edward had written a <a href="treatise">treatise</a> on the pope as <a href="Antichrist">Antichrist</a> and was making informed notes on theological controversies. Many aspects of Edward's religion were essentially Catholic in his early years, including celebration of the <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a> and reverence for images and relics of the saints.

Both Edward's sisters were attentive to their brother and often visited him – on one occasion, Elizabeth gave him a shirt "of her own working". Edward "took special content" in Mary's company, though he disapproved of her taste for foreign dances; "I love you most", he wrote to her in 1546. In 1543, Henry invited his children to spend Christmas with him, signalling his reconciliation with his daughters, whom he had previously illegitimised and disinherited. The following spring, he restored them to their place in the succession with a <a href="Third%20Succession%20Act">Third Succession Act</a>, which also provided for a regency council during Edward's minority. This unaccustomed family harmony may have owed much to the influence of Henry's new wife, <a href="Catherine%20Parr">Catherine Parr</a>, of whom Edward soon became fond. He called her his "most dear mother" and in September 1546 wrote to her: "I received so many benefits from you that my mind can hardly grasp them."

Other children were brought to play with Edward, including the granddaughter of Edward's chamberlain, Sir William Sidney, who in adulthood recalled the prince as "a marvellous sweet child, of very mild and generous condition". Edward was educated with sons of nobles, "appointed to attend upon him" in what was a form of miniature court. Among these, <a href="Barnaby%20Fitzpatrick">Barnaby Fitzpatrick</a>, son of an Irish peer, became a close and lasting friend. Edward was more devoted to his schoolwork than his classmates and seems to have outshone them, motivated to do his "duty" and compete with his sister Elizabeth's academic prowess. Edward's surroundings and possessions were regally splendid: his rooms were hung with costly Flemish <a href="tapestries">tapestries</a>, and his clothes, books, and cutlery were encrusted with precious jewels and gold. Like his father, Edward was fascinated by military arts, and many of his portraits show him wearing a gold dagger with a jewelled hilt, in imitation of Henry. Edward's "Chronicle" enthusiastically details English military campaigns against Scotland and France, and adventures such as <a href="John%20Dudley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">John Dudley</a>'s near capture at <a href="Musselburgh">Musselburgh</a> in 1547.

On 1 July 1543, Henry VIII signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Greenwich">Treaty of Greenwich</a> with the Scots, sealing the peace with Edward's <a href="betrothal">betrothal</a> to the seven-month-old <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>. The Scots were in a weak bargaining position after their defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Solway%20Moss">Solway Moss</a> the previous November, and Henry, seeking to unite the two realms, stipulated that Mary be handed over to him to be brought up in England. When the Scots repudiated the treaty in December 1543 and renewed their alliance with France, Henry was enraged. In April 1544, he ordered Edward's uncle, <a href="Edward%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford</a>, to invade Scotland and "put all to fire and sword, <a href="Burning%20of%20Edinburgh%20%281544%29">burn Edinburgh town</a>, so razed and defaced when you have sacked and gotten what ye can of it, as there may remain forever a perpetual memory of the vengeance of God lightened upon [them] for their falsehood and disloyalty". Seymour responded with the most savage campaign ever launched by the English against the Scots. The war, which continued into Edward's reign, has become known as "<a href="The%20Rough%20Wooing">The Rough Wooing</a>".

The nine-year-old Edward wrote to his father and stepmother on 10 January 1547 from <a href="Hertford">Hertford</a> thanking them for his new year's gift of their portraits from life. By 28 January 1547, Henry VIII was dead. Those close to the throne, led by Edward Seymour and <a href="William%20Paget%2C%201st%20Baron%20Paget">William Paget</a>, agreed to delay the announcement of the king's death until arrangements had been made for a smooth succession. Seymour and <a href="Sir%20Anthony%20Browne%20%28d.1548%29">Sir Anthony Browne</a>, the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Horse">Master of the Horse</a>, rode to collect Edward from Hertford and brought him to <a href="Enfield%20Town">Enfield</a>, where Lady Elizabeth was living. He and Elizabeth were then told of the death of their father and heard a reading of the will.

The Lord Chancellor, <a href="Thomas%20Wriothesley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Southampton">Thomas Wriothesley</a>, announced Henry's death to parliament on 31 January, and general proclamations of Edward's succession were ordered. The new king was taken to the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>, where he was welcomed with "great shot of ordnance in all places there about, as well out of the Tower as out of the ships". The following day, the nobles of the realm made their <a href="obeisance">obeisance</a> to Edward at the Tower, and Seymour was announced as <a href="Minority%20reign">Protector</a>. Henry VIII was buried at Windsor on 16 February, in the same tomb as Jane Seymour, as he had wished.

Edward VI was crowned at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> four days later on Sunday 20 February. The ceremonies were shortened, because of the "tedious length of the same which should weary and be hurtsome peradventure to the King's majesty, being yet of tender age", and also because the Reformation had rendered some of them inappropriate.

On the eve of the coronation, Edward progressed on horseback from the Tower to the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> through thronging crowds and pageants, many based on the pageants for a previous boy king, <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a>. He laughed at a Spanish <a href="tightrope%20walking">tightrope walker</a> who "tumbled and played many pretty toys" outside <a href="Old%20St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>.

At the coronation service, Cranmer affirmed the <a href="Acts%20of%20Supremacy">royal supremacy</a> and called Edward a second <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a>, urging him to continue the reformation of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, "the tyranny of the Bishops of Rome banished from your subjects, and images removed". After the service, Edward presided at a banquet in <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a>, where, he recalled in his "Chronicle", he dined with his crown on his head.

<a href="Henry%20VIII%27s%20will">Henry VIII's will</a> named sixteen <a href="executor">executor</a>s, who were to act as Edward's Council until he reached the age of eighteen. These executors were supplemented by twelve men "of counsail" who would assist the executors when called on. The final state of Henry VIII's will has been the subject of controversy. Some historians suggest that those close to the king manipulated either him or the will itself to ensure a share-out of power to their benefit, both material and religious. In this reading, the composition of the <a href="Privy%20Chamber">Privy Chamber</a> shifted towards the end of 1546 in favour of the reforming <a href="political%20faction">faction</a>. In addition, two leading conservative Privy Councillors were removed from the centre of power.

<a href="Stephen%20Gardiner">Stephen Gardiner</a> was refused access to Henry during his last months. <a href="Thomas%20Howard%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk</a>, found himself accused of <a href="treason">treason</a>; the day before the king's death his vast estates were seized, making them available for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>. Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the Council, and that the radicalism of such men as <a href="Anthony%20Denny">Sir Anthony Denny</a>, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is debatable.

Whatever the case, Henry's death was followed by a lavish hand-out of lands and honours to the new power group. The will contained an "unfulfilled gifts" clause, added at the last minute, which allowed Henry's executors to freely distribute lands and honours to themselves and the court, particularly to <a href="Edward%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford</a>, the new king's uncle who became <a href="Lord%20Protector">Lord Protector of the Realm</a>, Governor of the King's Person, and <a href="Duke%20of%20Somerset">Duke of Somerset</a>.

In fact, Henry VIII's will did not provide for the appointment of a Protector. It entrusted the government of the realm during his son's minority to a Regency Council that would rule collectively, by majority decision, with "like and equal charge". Nevertheless, a few days after Henry's death, on 4 February, the executors chose to invest almost regal power in Edward Seymour, now Duke of Somerset. Thirteen out of the sixteen (the others being absent) agreed to his appointment as Protector, which they justified as their joint decision "by virtue of the authority" of Henry's will. Somerset may have done a deal with some of the executors, who almost all received hand-outs. He is known to have done so with <a href="William%20Paget%2C%201st%20Baron%20Paget">William Paget</a>, private secretary to Henry VIII, and to have secured the support of <a href="Sir%20Anthony%20Browne%20%28d.1548%29">Sir Anthony Browne</a> of the Privy Chamber.

Somerset's appointment was in keeping with historical precedent, and his eligibility for the role was reinforced by his military successes in Scotland and France. In March 1547, he secured <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> from King Edward granting him the almost monarchical right to appoint members to the Privy Council himself and to consult them only when he wished. In the words of historian <a href="Geoffrey%20Elton">Geoffrey Elton</a>, "from that moment his autocratic system was complete". He proceeded to rule largely by <a href="proclamation">proclamation</a>, calling on the Privy Council to do little more than rubber-stamp his decisions.

Somerset's takeover of power was smooth and efficient. The <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">imperial ambassador</a>, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20van%20der%20Delft">François van der Delft</a>, reported that he "governs everything absolutely", with Paget operating as his secretary, though he predicted trouble from <a href="John%20Dudley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">John Dudley, Viscount Lisle</a>, who had recently been raised to <a href="Earl%20of%20Warwick">Earl of Warwick</a> in the share-out of honours. In fact, in the early weeks of his Protectorate, Somerset was challenged only by the Chancellor, <a href="Thomas%20Wriothesley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Southampton">Thomas Wriothesley</a>, whom the <a href="Earl%20of%20Southampton">Earldom of Southampton</a> had evidently failed to buy off, and by his own brother. Wriothesley, a religious conservative, objected to Somerset's assumption of monarchical power over the Council. He then found himself abruptly dismissed from the chancellorship on charges of selling off some of his offices to delegates.

Somerset faced less manageable opposition from his younger brother <a href="Thomas%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Baron%20Seymour%20of%20Sudeley">Thomas Seymour</a>, who has been described as a "worm in the bud". As King Edward's uncle, Thomas Seymour demanded the governorship of the king's person and a greater share of power. Somerset tried to buy his brother off with a <a href="baron">baron</a>y, an appointment to the <a href="Admiralty">Lord Admiralship</a>, and a seat on the Privy Council—but Thomas was bent on scheming for power. He began smuggling pocket money to King Edward, telling him that Somerset held the purse strings too tight, making him a "beggarly king". He also urged him to throw off the Protector within two years and "bear rule as other kings do"; but Edward, schooled to defer to the Council, failed to co-operate. In the Spring of 1547, using Edward's support to circumvent Somerset's opposition, Thomas Seymour secretly married Henry VIII's widow <a href="Catherine%20Parr">Catherine Parr</a>, whose Protestant household included the 11-year-old <a href="Lady%20Jane%20Grey">Lady Jane Grey</a> and the 13-year-old Lady Elizabeth.

In summer 1548, a pregnant Catherine Parr discovered Thomas Seymour embracing Lady Elizabeth. As a result, Elizabeth was removed from Catherine Parr's household and transferred to <a href="Sir%20Anthony%20Denny">Sir Anthony Denny</a>'s. That September, Catherine Parr died shortly after childbirth, and Thomas Seymour promptly resumed his attentions to Elizabeth by letter, planning to marry her. Elizabeth was receptive, but, like Edward, unready to agree to anything unless permitted by the Council. In January 1549, the Council had Thomas Seymour arrested on various charges, including <a href="embezzlement">embezzlement</a> at the Bristol <a href="mint%20%28coin%29">mint</a>. King Edward, whom Seymour was accused of planning to marry to <a href="Lady%20Jane%20Grey">Lady Jane Grey</a>, himself testified about the pocket money. Lack of clear evidence for treason ruled out a trial, so Seymour was condemned instead by an <a href="Bill%20of%20Attainder">Act of Attainder</a> and beheaded on 20 March 1549.

Somerset's only undoubted skill was as a soldier, which he had proven on expeditions to Scotland and in the defence of <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne-sur-Mer</a> in 1546. From the first, his main interest as Protector was the war against Scotland. After a crushing victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pinkie%20Cleugh">Battle of Pinkie Cleugh</a> in September 1547, he set up a network of garrisons in Scotland, stretching as far north as <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a>. His initial successes, however, were followed by a loss of direction, as his aim of uniting the realms through conquest became increasingly unrealistic. The Scots allied with France, who sent reinforcements for the defence of Edinburgh in 1548. The Queen of Scots was moved to France, where she was betrothed to the <a href="Francis%20II%20of%20France">Dauphin</a>. The cost of maintaining the Protector's massive armies and his permanent garrisons in Scotland also placed an unsustainable burden on the royal finances. A French attack on Boulogne in August 1549 at last forced Somerset to begin a withdrawal from Scotland.

During 1548, England was subject to social unrest. After April 1549, a series of armed revolts broke out, fuelled by various religious and agrarian grievances. The two most serious rebellions, which required major military intervention to put down, were in Devon and Cornwall and in Norfolk. The first, sometimes called the <a href="Prayer%20Book%20Rebellion">Prayer Book Rebellion</a>, arose from the imposition of Protestantism, and the second, led by a tradesman called <a href="Kett%27s%20Rebellion">Robert Kett</a>, mainly from the encroachment of landlords on common grazing ground. A complex aspect of the social unrest was that the protesters believed they were acting legitimately against <a href="enclosure">enclosing</a> landlords with the Protector's support, convinced that the landlords were the lawbreakers.

The same justification for outbreaks of unrest was voiced throughout the country, not only in Norfolk and the west. The origin of the popular view of Somerset as sympathetic to the rebel cause lies partly in his series of sometimes liberal, often contradictory, proclamations, and partly in the uncoordinated activities of the commissions he sent out in 1548 and 1549 to investigate grievances about loss of tillage, encroachment of large sheep flocks on <a href="common%20land">common land</a>, and similar issues. Somerset's commissions were led by an evangelical M.P. called <a href="John%20Hales%20%28died%201572%29">John Hales</a>, whose socially liberal rhetoric linked the issue of enclosure with Reformation theology and the notion of a godly <a href="commonwealth">commonwealth</a>. Local groups often assumed that the findings of these commissions entitled them to act against offending landlords themselves. King Edward wrote in his "Chronicle" that the 1549 risings began "because certain commissions were sent down to pluck down enclosures".

Whatever the popular view of Somerset, the disastrous events of 1549 were taken as evidence of a colossal failure of government, and the Council laid the responsibility at the Protector's door. In July 1549, Paget wrote to Somerset: "Every man of the council have misliked your proceedings ... would to God, that, at the first stir you had followed the matter hotly, and caused justice to be ministered in solemn fashion to the terror of others ...".

The sequence of events that led to Somerset's removal from power has often been called a "coup d'état". By 1 October 1549, Somerset had been alerted that his rule faced a serious threat. He issued a proclamation calling for assistance, took possession of the king's person, and withdrew for safety to the fortified <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, where Edward wrote, "Me thinks I am in prison". Meanwhile, a united Council published details of Somerset's government mismanagement. They made clear that the Protector's power came from them, not from Henry VIII's will. On 11 October, the Council had Somerset arrested and brought the king to <a href="Richmond%20Palace">Richmond</a>. Edward summarised the charges against Somerset in his "Chronicle": "ambition, vainglory, entering into rash wars in mine youth, negligent looking on Newhaven, enriching himself of my treasure, following his own opinion, and doing all by his own authority, etc." In February 1550, <a href="John%20Dudley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">John Dudley, Earl of Warwick</a>, emerged as the leader of the Council and, in effect, as Somerset's successor. Although Somerset was released from the Tower and restored to the Council, he was executed for <a href="felony">felony</a> in January 1552 after scheming to overthrow Dudley's regime. Edward noted his uncle's death in his "Chronicle": "the duke of Somerset had his head cut off upon Tower Hill between eight and nine o'clock in the morning".

Historians contrast the efficiency of Somerset's takeover of power, in which they detect the organising skills of allies such as Paget, the "master of practices", with the subsequent ineptitude of his rule. By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the country. Until recent decades, Somerset's reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class. More recently, however, he has often been portrayed as an arrogant and aloof ruler, lacking in political and administrative skills.

In contrast, Somerset's successor <a href="John%20Dudley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">John Dudley</a>, Earl of Warwick, made <a href="Duke%20of%20Northumberland">Duke of Northumberland</a> in 1551, was once regarded by historians merely as a grasping schemer who cynically elevated and enriched himself at the expense of the crown. Since the 1970s, the administrative and economic achievements of his regime have been recognised, and he has been credited with restoring the authority of the royal Council and returning the government to an even keel after the disasters of Somerset's protectorate.

The Earl of Warwick's rival for leadership of the new regime was <a href="Thomas%20Wriothesley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Southampton">Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton</a>, whose conservative supporters had allied with Dudley's followers to create a unanimous Council, which they, and observers such as the Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a>'s ambassador, expected to reverse Somerset's policy of religious reform. Warwick, on the other hand, pinned his hopes on the king's strong Protestantism and, claiming that Edward was old enough to rule in person, moved himself and his people closer to the king, taking control of the Privy Chamber. Paget, accepting a barony, joined Warwick when he realised that a conservative policy would not bring the emperor onto the English side over Boulogne. Southampton prepared a case for executing Somerset, aiming to discredit Warwick through Somerset's statements that he had done all with Warwick's co-operation. As a counter-move, Warwick convinced parliament to free Somerset, which it did on 14 January 1550. Warwick then had Southampton and his followers purged from the Council after winning the support of Council members in return for titles, and was made <a href="Lord%20President%20of%20the%20Council">Lord President of the Council</a> and great master of the king's household. Although not called a Protector, he was now clearly the head of the government.

As Edward was growing up, he was able to understand more and more government business. However, his actual involvement in decisions has long been a matter of debate, and during the 20th century, historians have presented the whole gamut of possibilities, "balanc[ing] an articulate puppet against a mature, precocious, and essentially adult king", in the words of Stephen Alford. A special "Counsel for the Estate" was created when Edward was fourteen. Edward chose the members himself. In the weekly meetings with this Council, Edward was "to hear the debating of things of most importance". A major point of contact with the king was the Privy Chamber, and there Edward worked closely with <a href="William%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Baron%20Burghley">William Cecil</a> and <a href="William%20Petre">William Petre</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28England%29">Principal Secretaries</a>. The king's greatest influence was in matters of religion, where the Council followed the strongly Protestant policy that Edward favoured.

The Duke of Northumberland's mode of operation was very different from Somerset's. Careful to make sure he always commanded a majority of councillors, he encouraged a working council and used it to legitimise his authority. Lacking Somerset's blood-relationship with the king, he added members to the Council from his own faction in order to control it. He also added members of his family to the royal household. He saw that to achieve personal dominance, he needed total procedural control of the Council. In the words of historian <a href="John%20Guy%20%28historian%29">John Guy</a>, "Like Somerset, he became quasi-king; the difference was that he managed the bureaucracy on the pretence that Edward had assumed full sovereignty, whereas Somerset had asserted the right to near-sovereignty as Protector".
Warwick's war policies were more pragmatic than Somerset's, and they have earned him criticism for weakness. In 1550, he signed a peace treaty with France that agreed to withdrawal from Boulogne and recalled all English garrisons from Scotland. In 1551, Edward was betrothed to <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Valois">Elisabeth of Valois</a>, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20France">King Henry II</a>'s daughter, and was made a <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Michael">Knight of Saint Michael</a>. In practice, he realised that England could no longer support the cost of wars. At home, he took measures to police local unrest. To forestall future rebellions, he kept permanent representatives of the crown in the localities, including <a href="lord%20lieutenant">lords lieutenant</a>, who commanded military forces and reported back to central government.

Working with <a href="William%20Paulet%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Winchester">William Paulet</a> and <a href="Walter%20Mildmay">Walter Mildmay</a>, Warwick tackled the disastrous state of the kingdom's finances. However, his regime first succumbed to the temptations of a quick profit by further <a href="debasement">debasing</a> the coinage. The economic disaster that resulted caused Warwick to hand the initiative to the expert <a href="Thomas%20Gresham">Thomas Gresham</a>. By 1552, confidence in the coinage was restored, prices fell, and trade at last improved. Though a full economic recovery was not achieved until Elizabeth's reign, its origins lay in the Duke of Northumberland's policies. The regime also cracked down on widespread embezzlement of government finances, and carried out a thorough review of revenue collection practices, which has been called "one of the more remarkable achievements of Tudor administration".

In the matter of religion, the regime of Northumberland followed the same policy as that of Somerset, supporting an increasingly vigorous programme of reform. Although Edward VI's practical influence on government was limited, his intense Protestantism made a reforming administration obligatory; his succession was managed by the reforming faction, who continued in power throughout his reign. The man Edward trusted most, Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, introduced a series of religious reforms that revolutionised the English church from one that—while rejecting papal supremacy—remained essentially Catholic, to one that was institutionally Protestant. The confiscation of church property that had begun under Henry VIII resumed under Edward—notably with the dissolution of the <a href="chantries">chantries</a>—to the great monetary advantage of the crown and the new owners of the seized property. Church reform was therefore as much a political as a religious policy under Edward VI. By the end of his reign, the church had been financially ruined, with much of the property of the bishops transferred into lay hands.

The religious convictions of both Somerset and Northumberland have proved elusive for historians, who are divided on the sincerity of their Protestantism. There is less doubt, however, about the religious fervour of King Edward, who was said to have read twelve chapters of scripture daily and enjoyed sermons, and was commemorated by <a href="John%20Foxe">John Foxe</a> as a "godly imp". Edward was depicted during his life and afterwards as a new <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a>, the biblical king who destroyed the <a href="idolatry">idols</a> of <a href="Baal">Baal</a>. He could be <a href="prig">prig</a>gish in his anti-Catholicism and once asked Catherine Parr to persuade Lady Mary "to attend no longer to foreign dances and merriments which do not become a most Christian princess". Edward's biographer Jennifer Loach cautions, however, against accepting too readily the pious image of Edward handed down by the reformers, as in <a href="John%20Foxe">John Foxe</a>'s influential "<a href="Foxe%27s%20Book%20of%20Martyrs">Acts and Monuments</a>", where a woodcut depicts the young king listening to a sermon by <a href="Hugh%20Latimer">Hugh Latimer</a>. In the early part of his life, Edward conformed to the prevailing Catholic practices, including attendance at <a href="mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a>: but he became convinced, under the influence of Cranmer and the reformers among his tutors and courtiers, that "true" religion should be imposed in England.

The <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a> advanced under pressure from two directions: from the traditionalists on the one hand and the <a href="zealots">zealots</a> on the other, who led incidents of <a href="iconoclasm">iconoclasm</a> (image-smashing) and complained that reform did not go far enough. Reformed doctrines were made official, such as <a href="Sola%20fide">justification by faith alone</a> and <a href="Eucharist">communion</a> for <a href="laity">laity</a> as well as clergy in <a href="Communion%20under%20both%20kinds">both kinds</a>, of bread and wine. The Ordinal of 1550 replaced the divine ordination of priests with a government-run appointment system, authorising <a href="Minister%20%28Christianity%29">ministers</a> to preach the gospel and administer the <a href="sacraments">sacraments</a> rather than, as before, "to offer sacrifice and celebrate mass both for the living and the dead". Cranmer set himself the task of writing a uniform <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> in English, detailing all weekly and daily services and religious festivals, to be made compulsory in the first <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201549">Act of Uniformity of 1549</a>. The "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" of 1549, intended as a compromise, was attacked by traditionalists for dispensing with many cherished rituals of the liturgy, such as the <a href="elevation%20%28liturgy%29">elevation</a> of the bread and wine, while some reformers complained about the retention of too many "popish" elements, including vestiges of sacrificial rites at communion. The prayer book was also opposed by many senior Catholic clerics, including <a href="Stephen%20Gardiner">Stephen Gardiner</a>, Bishop of Winchester, and <a href="Edmund%20Bonner">Edmund Bonner</a>, Bishop of London, who were both imprisoned in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower</a> and, along with others, deprived of their sees.

After 1551, the Reformation advanced further, with the approval and encouragement of Edward, who began to exert more personal influence in his role as <a href="Supreme%20Head">Supreme Head</a> of the church. The new changes were also a response to criticism from such reformers as <a href="John%20Hooper%20%28bishop%29">John Hooper</a>, Bishop of Gloucester, and the Scot <a href="John%20Knox">John Knox</a>, who was employed as a minister in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> under the Duke of Northumberland and whose preaching at court prompted the king to oppose kneeling at communion. Cranmer was also influenced by the views of the continental reformer <a href="Martin%20Bucer">Martin Bucer</a>, who died in England in 1551, by <a href="Pietro%20Martire%20Vermigli">Peter Martyr</a>, who was teaching at Oxford, and by other foreign theologians. The progress of the Reformation was further speeded by the consecration of more reformers as bishops. In the winter of 1551–52, Cranmer rewrote the "Book of Common Prayer" in less ambiguous reformist terms, revised <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>, and prepared a doctrinal statement, the <a href="Thirty-nine%20Articles">Forty-two Articles</a>, to clarify the practice of the reformed religion, particularly in the divisive matter of the communion service. Cranmer's formulation of the reformed religion, finally divesting the communion service of any notion of the <a href="real%20presence">real presence</a> of God in the bread and the wine, effectively abolished the <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a>. According to Elton, the publication of Cranmer's revised prayer book in 1552, supported by a second <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201552">Act of Uniformity</a>, "marked the arrival of the English Church at Protestantism". The prayer book of 1552 remains the foundation of the Church of England's services. However, Cranmer was unable to implement all these reforms once it became clear in spring 1553 that King Edward, upon whom the whole Reformation in England depended, was dying.

In February 1553, Edward VI became ill, and by June, after several improvements and relapses, he was in a hopeless condition. The king's death and the succession of his Catholic half-sister Mary would jeopardise the English Reformation, and Edward's Council and officers had many reasons to fear it. Edward himself opposed Mary's succession, not only on religious grounds but also on those of legitimacy and male inheritance, which also applied to Elizabeth. He composed a draft document, headed "My devise for the succession", in which he undertook to change the succession, most probably inspired by his father Henry VIII's precedent. He passed over the claims of his half-sisters and, at last, settled the Crown on his first cousin once removed, the 16-year-old Lady Jane Grey, who on 25 May 1553 had married <a href="Lord%20Guilford%20Dudley">Lord Guilford Dudley</a>, a younger son of the Duke of Northumberland. In the document he writes:

In his document Edward provided, in case of "lack of issue of my body", for the succession of male heirs only, that is, Jane Grey's mother's male heirs, Jane's, or her sisters'. As his death approached and possibly persuaded by Northumberland, he altered the wording so that Jane and her sisters themselves should be able to succeed. Yet Edward conceded Jane's right only as an exception to male rule, demanded by reality, an example not to be followed if Jane or her sisters had only daughters. In the final document both Mary and Elizabeth were excluded because of bastardy; since both had been declared bastards under Henry VIII and never made legitimate again, this reason could be advanced for both sisters. The provisions to alter the succession directly contravened Henry VIII's <a href="Third%20Succession%20Act">Third Succession Act</a> of 1543 and have been described as bizarre and illogical.

In early June, Edward personally supervised the drafting of a clean version of his devise by lawyers, to which he lent his signature "in six several places." Then, on 15 June he summoned high ranking judges to his sickbed, commanding them on their allegiance "with sharp words and angry countenance" to prepare his devise as <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> and announced that he would have these passed in parliament. His next measure was to have leading councillors and lawyers sign a bond in his presence, in which they agreed faithfully to perform Edward's will after his death. A few months later, <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20Common%20Pleas">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Edward%20Montagu%20%28judge%29">Edward Montagu</a> recalled that when he and his colleagues had raised legal objections to the devise, Northumberland had threatened them "trembling for anger, and ... further said that he would fight in his shirt with any man in that quarrel". Montagu also overheard a group of lords standing behind him conclude "if they refused to do that, they were traitors". At last, on 21 June, the devise was signed by over a hundred notables, including councillors, peers, archbishops, bishops, and sheriffs; many of them later claimed that they had been bullied into doing so by Northumberland, although in the words of Edward's biographer Jennifer Loach, "few of them gave any clear indication of reluctance at the time".

It was now common knowledge that Edward was dying, and foreign diplomats suspected that some scheme to debar Mary was under way. France found the prospect of the emperor's cousin on the English throne disagreeable and engaged in secret talks with Northumberland, indicating support. The diplomats were certain that the overwhelming majority of the English people backed Mary, but nevertheless believed that Queen Jane would be successfully established.

For centuries, the attempt to alter the succession was mostly seen as a one-man-plot by the Duke of Northumberland. Since the 1970s, however, many historians have attributed the inception of the "devise" and the insistence on its implementation to the king's initiative. <a href="Diarmaid%20MacCulloch">Diarmaid MacCulloch</a> has made out Edward's "teenage dreams of founding an evangelical realm of Christ", while <a href="David%20Starkey">David Starkey</a> has stated that "Edward had a couple of co-operators, but the driving will was his". Among other members of the Privy Chamber, Northumberland's intimate <a href="John%20Gates%20%28courtier%29">Sir John Gates</a> has been suspected of suggesting to Edward to change his devise so that Lady Jane Grey herself—not just any sons of hers—could inherit the Crown. Whatever the degree of his contribution, Edward was convinced that his word was law and fully endorsed disinheriting his half-sisters: "barring Mary from the succession was a cause in which the young King believed."

Edward became ill during January 1553 with a fever and cough that gradually worsened. The <a href="List%20of%20ambassadors%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20England%20to%20the%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">imperial ambassador</a>, <a href="Jean%20Scheyfve">Jean Scheyfve</a>, reported that "he suffers a good deal when the fever is upon him, especially from a difficulty in drawing his breath, which is due to the compression of the organs on the right side". Edward felt well enough in early April to take the air in the park at Westminster and to move to Greenwich, but by the end of the month he had weakened again. By 7 May he was "much amended", and the royal doctors had no doubt of his recovery. A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, sitting at his window. However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king's household, reported that "the matter he ejects from his mouth is sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood". Now his doctors believed he was suffering from "a suppurating tumour" of the lung and admitted that Edward's life was beyond recovery. Soon, his legs became so swollen that he had to lie on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease. To his tutor <a href="John%20Cheke">John Cheke</a> he whispered, "I am glad to die".

Edward made his final appearance in public on 1 July, when he showed himself at his window in Greenwich Palace, horrifying those who saw him by his "thin and wasted" condition. During the next two days, large crowds arrived hoping to see the king again, but on 3 July, they were told that the weather was too chilly for him to appear. Edward died at the age of 15 at <a href="Greenwich%20Palace">Greenwich Palace</a> at 8 pm on 6 July 1553. According to <a href="John%20Foxe">John Foxe</a>'s legendary account of his death, his last words were: "I am faint; Lord have mercy upon me, and take my spirit". He was buried in the <a href="Henry%20VII%20Lady%20Chapel">Henry VII Lady Chapel</a> at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on 8 August 1553, with reformed rites performed by <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>. The procession was led by "a grett company of chylderyn in ther surples" and watched by Londoners "wepyng and lamenting"; the funeral chariot, draped in cloth of gold, was topped by an effigy of Edward, with crown, sceptre, and garter. Edward's burial place was unmarked until as late as 1966, when an inscribed stone was laid in the chapel floor by <a href="Christ%27s%20Hospital">Christ's Hospital</a> school to commemorate their founder. The inscription reads as follows: "In Memory Of King Edward VI Buried In This Chapel This Stone Was Placed Here By Christ's Hospital In Thanksgiving For Their Founder 7 October 1966". 

The cause of Edward VI's death is not certain. As with many royal deaths in the 16th century, rumours of poisoning abounded, but no evidence has been found to support these. The Duke of Northumberland, whose unpopularity was underlined by the events that followed Edward's death, was widely believed to have ordered the imagined poisoning. Another theory held that Edward had been poisoned by Catholics seeking to bring Mary to the throne. The surgeon who opened Edward's chest after his death found that "the disease whereof his majesty died was the disease of the lungs". The Venetian ambassador reported that Edward had died of consumption—in other words, <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>—a diagnosis accepted by many historians. Skidmore believes that Edward contracted tuberculosis after a bout of <a href="measles">measles</a> and <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> in 1552 that suppressed his natural immunity to the disease. Loach suggests instead that his symptoms were typical of acute <a href="bronchopneumonia">bronchopneumonia</a>, leading to a "suppurating pulmonary infection" or <a href="lung%20abscess">lung abscess</a>, <a href="sepsis">septicaemia</a>, and <a href="renal%20failure">kidney failure</a>.

Lady Mary was last seen by Edward in February, and was kept informed about the state of her brother's health by Northumberland and through her contacts with the imperial ambassadors. Aware of Edward's imminent death, she left <a href="Hunsdon%20House">Hunsdon House</a>, near London, and sped to her estates around <a href="Kenninghall">Kenninghall</a> in Norfolk, where she could count on the support of her <a href="tenants">tenants</a>. Northumberland sent ships to the Norfolk coast to prevent her escape or the arrival of reinforcements from the continent. He delayed the announcement of the king's death while he gathered his forces, and Jane Grey was taken to the Tower on 10 July. On the same day, she was proclaimed queen in the streets of London, to murmurings of discontent. The Privy Council received a message from Mary asserting her "right and title" to the throne and commanding that the Council proclaim her queen, as she had already proclaimed herself. The Council replied that Jane was queen by Edward's authority and that Mary, by contrast, was illegitimate and supported only by "a few lewd, base people".

Northumberland soon realised that he had miscalculated drastically, not least in failing to secure Mary's person before Edward's death. Although many of those who rallied to Mary were conservatives hoping for the defeat of Protestantism, her supporters also included many for whom her lawful claim to the throne overrode religious considerations. Northumberland was obliged to relinquish control of a nervous Council in London and launch an unplanned pursuit of Mary into <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, from where news was arriving of her growing support, which included a number of nobles and gentlemen and "innumerable companies of the common people". On 14 July Northumberland marched out of London with three thousand men, reaching <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> the next day; meanwhile, Mary rallied her forces at <a href="Framlingham%20Castle">Framlingham Castle</a> in Suffolk, gathering an army of nearly twenty thousand by 19 July.

It now dawned on the Privy Council that it had made a terrible mistake. Led by the <a href="Henry%20Fitzalan%2C%2019th%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">Earl of Arundel</a> and the Earl of Pembroke, on 19 July the Council publicly proclaimed Mary as queen; Jane's nine-day reign came to an end. The proclamation triggered wild rejoicing throughout London. Stranded in Cambridge, Northumberland proclaimed Mary himself—as he had been commanded to do by a letter from the Council. <a href="William%20Paget%2C%201st%20Baron%20Paget">William Paget</a> and the <a href="Henry%20FitzAlan%2C%2019th%20Earl%20of%20Arundel">Earl of Arundel</a> rode to Framlingham to beg Mary's pardon, and Arundel arrested Northumberland on 24 July. Northumberland was beheaded on 22 August, shortly after renouncing Protestantism. His recantation dismayed his daughter-in-law, Jane, who followed him to the scaffold on 12 February 1554, after her father's involvement in <a href="Wyatt%27s%20rebellion">Wyatt's rebellion</a>.

Although Edward reigned for only six years and died at the age of 15, his reign made a lasting contribution to the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a> and the structure of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. The last decade of Henry VIII's reign had seen a partial stalling of the Reformation, a drifting back to more conservative values. By contrast, Edward's reign saw radical progress in the Reformation. In those six years, the Church transferred from an essentially Catholic liturgy and structure to one that is usually identified as Protestant. In particular, the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal of 1550, and Cranmer's <a href="Thirty-nine%20Articles">Forty-two Articles</a> formed the basis for English Church practices that continue to this day. Edward himself fully approved these changes, and though they were the work of reformers such as Thomas Cranmer, <a href="Hugh%20Latimer">Hugh Latimer</a>, and <a href="Nicholas%20Ridley%20%28martyr%29">Nicholas Ridley</a>, backed by Edward's determinedly evangelical Council, the fact of the king's religion was a catalyst in the acceleration of the Reformation during his reign.

Queen Mary's attempts to undo the reforming work of her brother's reign faced major obstacles. Despite her belief in the papal supremacy, she ruled constitutionally as the <a href="Supreme%20Head">Supreme Head</a> of the English Church, a contradiction under which she bridled. She found herself entirely unable to restore the vast number of ecclesiastical properties handed over or sold to private landowners. Although she burned a number of leading Protestant churchmen, many reformers either went into exile or remained subversively active in England during her reign, producing a torrent of reforming propaganda that she was unable to stem. Nevertheless, Protestantism was not yet "printed in the stomachs" of the English people, and had Mary lived longer, her Catholic reconstruction might have succeeded, leaving Edward's reign, rather than hers, as a historical aberration.

On Mary's death in 1558, the English Reformation resumed its course, and most of the reforms instituted during Edward's reign were reinstated in the <a href="Elizabethan%20Religious%20Settlement">Elizabethan Religious Settlement</a>. Queen Elizabeth replaced Mary's councillors and bishops with ex-Edwardians, such as <a href="William%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Baron%20Burghley">William Cecil</a>, Northumberland's former secretary, and <a href="Richard%20Cox%20%28bishop%29">Richard Cox</a>, Edward's old tutor, who preached an anti-Catholic sermon at the opening of parliament in 1559. Parliament passed an <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201559">Act of Uniformity</a> the following spring that restored, with modifications, Cranmer's prayer book of 1552; and the <a href="Thirty-nine%20Articles">Thirty-nine Articles</a> of 1563 were largely based on Cranmer's Forty-two Articles. The theological developments of Edward's reign provided a vital source of reference for Elizabeth's religious policies, though the internationalism of the Edwardian Reformation was never revived.

Enid Blyton

Enid Mary Blyton (11 August 1897 – 28 November 1968) was an English <a href="List%20of%20children%27s%20literature%20authors">children's writer</a> whose books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies. Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into 90 languages; her first book, "<a href="Child%20Whispers">Child Whispers</a>", a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922. She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her <a href="Noddy%20%28character%29">Noddy</a>, <a href="The%20Famous%20Five%20%28novel%20series%29">Famous Five</a>, <a href="The%20Secret%20Seven">Secret Seven</a> and <a href="Malory%20Towers">Malory Towers</a> series.

Following the commercial success of her early novels such as "<a href="The%20Wishing-Chair%20%28series%29">Adventures of the Wishing-Chair</a>" (1937) and "<a href="The%20Enchanted%20Wood%20%28novel%29">The Enchanted Wood</a>" (1939), Blyton went on to build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year in addition to her prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. The sheer volume of her work and the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of <a href="ghost%20writer">ghost writer</a>s, a charge she vigorously denied.

Blyton's work became increasingly controversial among literary critics, teachers and parents from the 1950s onwards, because of the alleged unchallenging nature of her writing and the themes of her books, particularly the Noddy series. Some libraries and schools banned her works, which the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> had refused to broadcast from the 1930s until the 1950s because they were perceived to lack literary merit. Her books have been criticised as being <a href="elitism">elitist</a>, <a href="sexism">sexist</a>, <a href="racism">racist</a>, <a href="xenophobia">xenophobic</a> and at odds with the more liberal environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.

Blyton felt she had a responsibility to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she encouraged them to support worthy causes. In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, she encouraged and organised them to raise funds for animal and <a href="paediatric">paediatric</a> charities. The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled "<a href="Enid%20%28film%29">Enid</a>", featuring <a href="Helena%20Bonham%20Carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a> in the title role and first broadcast in the United Kingdom on <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> in 2009. There have also been several adaptations of her books for stage, screen and television.

Enid Blyton was born on 11 August 1897 in <a href="East%20Dulwich">East Dulwich</a>, South London, the oldest of the three children, to Thomas Carey Blyton (1870–1920), a <a href="cutlery">cutlery</a> salesman, and his wife Theresa Mary ( Harrison; 1874–1950). Enid's younger brothers, Hanly (1899–1983) and Carey (1902–1976), were born after the family had moved to a semi-detached villa in <a href="Beckenham">Beckenham</a>, then a village in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. A few months after her birth Enid almost died from <a href="whooping%20cough">whooping cough</a>, but was nursed back to health by her father, whom she adored. Thomas Blyton ignited Enid's interest in nature; in her autobiography she wrote that he "loved flowers and birds and wild animals, and knew more about them than anyone I had ever met". He also passed on his interest in gardening, art, music, literature and the theatre, and the pair often went on nature walks, much to the disapproval of Enid's mother, who showed little interest in her daughter's pursuits. Enid was devastated when he left the family shortly after her thirteenth birthday to live with another woman. Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship, and she did not attend either of her parents' funerals.

From 1907 to 1915 Blyton attended St Christopher's School in Beckenham, where she enjoyed physical activities and became school tennis champion and captain of <a href="lacrosse">lacrosse</a>. She was not so keen on all the academic subjects but excelled in writing, and in 1911 she entered <a href="Arthur%20Mee">Arthur Mee</a>'s children's poetry competition. Mee offered to print her verses, encouraging her to produce more. Blyton's mother considered her efforts at writing to be a "waste of time and money", but she was encouraged to persevere by Mabel Attenborough, the aunt of school friend <a href="Mary%20Potter%20%28painter%29">Mary Potter</a>.
Blyton's father taught her to play the piano, which she mastered well enough for him to believe that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the <a href="Guildhall%20School%20of%20Music">Guildhall School of Music</a>, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school in 1915 as <a href="Head%20girl%20and%20head%20boy">head girl</a>, she moved out of the family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at <a href="Seckford%20Hall">Seckford Hall</a> near <a href="Woodbridge%2C%20Suffolk">Woodbridge</a> in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at <a href="Ipswich%20High%20School%20%28Suffolk%29">Ipswich High School</a>, and suggested that she train as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a <a href="National%20Froebel%20Foundation">National Froebel Union</a> teacher training course at the school in September 1916. By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family.

Blyton's manuscripts had been rejected by publishers on many occasions, which only made her more determined to succeed: "it is partly the struggle that helps you so much, that gives you determination, character, self-reliance – all things that help in any profession or trade, and most certainly in writing". In March 1916 her first poems were published in "Nash's Magazine". She completed her teacher training course in December 1918, and the following month obtained a teaching appointment at Bickley Park School, a small independent establishment for boys in <a href="Bickley">Bickley</a>, Kent. Two months later Blyton received a teaching certificate with distinctions in zoology and principles of education, 1st class in botany, geography, practice and history of education, child hygiene and class teaching and 2nd class in literature and elementary mathematics. In 1920 she moved to Southernhay in Hook Road <a href="Surbiton">Surbiton</a> as nursery governess to the four sons of architect Horace Thompson and his wife Gertrude, with whom Blyton spent four happy years. Owing to a shortage of schools in the area her charges were soon joined by the children of neighbours, and a small school developed at the house.

In 1920 Blyton relocated to <a href="Chessington">Chessington</a>, and began writing in her spare time. The following year she won the "Saturday Westminster Review" writing competition with her essay "On the Popular Fallacy that to the Pure All Things are Pure". Publications such as "<a href="The%20Londoner">The Londoner</a>", "Home Weekly" and "<a href="The%20Bystander">The Bystander</a>" began to show an interest in her short stories and poems.
Blyton's first book, "<a href="Child%20Whispers">Child Whispers</a>", a 24-page collection of poems, was published in 1922. It was illustrated by a schoolfriend, <a href="Phyllis%20Chase">Phyllis Chase</a>, who collaborated on several of her early works. Also in that year Blyton began writing in annuals for <a href="Cassell%20%28publisher%29">Cassell</a> and <a href="George%20Newnes">George Newnes</a>, and her first piece of writing, "Peronel and his Pot of Glue", was accepted for publication in "<a href="Teachers%27%20World">Teachers' World</a>". Her success was boosted in 1923 when her poems were published alongside those of <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, <a href="Walter%20de%20la%20Mare">Walter de la Mare</a> and <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a> in a special issue of "Teachers' World". Blyton's educational texts were quite influential in the 1920s and '30s, her most sizeable being the three-volume "The Teacher's Treasury" (1926), the six-volume "Modern Teaching" (1928), the ten-volume "Pictorial Knowledge" (1930), and the four-volume "Modern Teaching in the Infant School" (1932).

In July 1923 Blyton published "Real Fairies", a collection of thirty-three poems written especially for the book with the exception of "Pretending", which had appeared earlier in "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" magazine. The following year she published "The Enid Blyton Book of Fairies", illustrated by Horace J. Knowles, and in 1926 the "<a href="Book%20of%20Brownies">Book of Brownies</a>". Several books of plays appeared in 1927, including "A Book of Little Plays" and "The Play's the Thing" with the illustrator <a href="Alfred%20Bestall">Alfred Bestall</a>.

In the 1930s Blyton developed an interest in writing stories related to various myths, including those of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> and <a href="ancient%20Rome">Rome</a>; "The Knights of the Round Table", "Tales of Ancient Greece" and "Tales of Robin Hood" were published in 1930. In "Tales of Ancient Greece" Blyton retold sixteen well-known ancient Greek myths, but used the Latin rather than the Greek names of deities and invented conversations between the characters. "The Adventures of Odysseus", "Tales of the Ancient Greeks and Persians" and "Tales of the Romans" followed in 1934.

The first of twenty-eight books in Blyton's <a href="Old%20Thatch%20series">Old Thatch series</a>, "The Talking Teapot and Other Tales", was published in 1934, the same year as the first book in her <a href="Brer%20Rabbit">Brer Rabbit</a> series, "Brer Rabbit Retold"; (note that Brer Rabbit originally featured in <a href="Uncle%20Remus">Uncle Remus</a> stories by <a href="Joel%20Chandler%20Harris">Joel Chandler Harris</a>), her first serial story and first full-length book, "<a href="The%20Wishing-Chair%20%28series%29">Adventures of the Wishing-Chair</a>", followed in 1937. "<a href="The%20Enchanted%20Wood%20%28novel%29">The Enchanted Wood</a>", the first book in the <a href="The%20Faraway%20Tree">Faraway Tree series</a>, published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a> that had fascinated Blyton as a child. According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from "thinking up a story one day and suddenly she was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree. In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the Saucepan Man and the rest of the characters. She had all she needed." As in the Wishing-Chair series, these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet <a href="fairy">fairies</a>, <a href="goblins">goblins</a>, <a href="elves">elves</a>, <a href="pixie">pixie</a>s and other mythological creatures.

Blyton's first full-length adventure novel, "The Secret Island", was published in 1938, featuring the characters of Jack, Mike, Peggy and Nora. Described by "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Glasgow%29">The Glasgow Herald</a>" as a "<a href="Robinson%20Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a>-style adventure on an island in an English lake", "The Secret Island" was a lifelong favourite of Gillian's and spawned the <a href="The%20Secret%20Series%20%28Enid%20Blyton%29">Secret series</a>. The following year Blyton released her first book in the <a href="The%20Circus%20Series">Circus series</a> and her initial book in the <a href="Amelia%20Jane">Amelia Jane</a> series, "Naughty Amelia Jane!" According to Gillian the main character was based on a large handmade doll given to her by her mother on her third birthday.

During the 1940s Blyton became a prolific author, her success enhanced by her "marketing, publicity and branding that was far ahead of its time". In 1940 Blyton published two books – "Three Boys and a Circus" and "Children of Kidillin" – under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock (middle name plus first married name), in addition to the eleven published under her own name that year. So popular were Pollock's books that one reviewer was prompted to observe that "Enid Blyton had better look to her laurels". But Blyton's readers were not so easily deceived and many complained about the subterfuge to her and her publisher, with the result that all six books published under the name of Mary Pollock – two in 1940 and four in 1943 – were reissued under Blyton's name. Later in 1940 Blyton published the first of her <a href="boarding%20school%20story">boarding school story</a> books and the first novel in the <a href="The%20Naughtiest%20Girl">Naughtiest Girl</a> series, "<a href="The%20Naughtiest%20Girl%20in%20the%20School">The Naughtiest Girl in the School</a>", which followed the exploits of the mischievous schoolgirl Elizabeth Allen at the fictional Whyteleafe School. The first of her six novels in the <a href="St.%20Clare%27s%20%28series%29">St. Clare's</a> series, "<a href="The%20Twins%20at%20St.%20Clare%27s">The Twins at St. Clare's</a>", appeared the following year, featuring the twin sisters Patricia and Isabel O'Sullivan.

In 1942 Blyton released the first book in the <a href="Mary%20Mouse">Mary Mouse</a> series, "Mary Mouse and the Dolls' House", about a mouse exiled from her mousehole who becomes a maid at a dolls' house. Twenty-three books in the series were produced between 1942 and 1964; 10,000 copies were sold in 1942 alone. The same year, Blyton published the first novel in the <a href="The%20Famous%20Five%20%28novel%20series%29">Famous Five series</a>, "<a href="Five%20on%20a%20Treasure%20Island">Five on a Treasure Island</a>", with illustrations by <a href="Eileen%20Soper">Eileen Soper</a>. Its popularity resulted in twenty-one books between then and 1963, and the characters of Julian, Dick, Anne, George (Georgina) and Timmy the dog became household names in Britain. Matthew Grenby, author of "Children's Literature", states that the five were involved with "unmasking hardened villains and solving serious crimes", although the novels were "hardly 'hard-boiled' thrillers". Blyton based the character of Georgina, a <a href="tomboy">tomboy</a> she described as "short-haired, freckled, sturdy, and snub-nosed" and "bold and daring, hot-tempered and loyal", on herself.

Blyton had an interest in biblical narratives, and retold <a href="Old%20Testament">Old</a> and <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> stories. "<a href="The%20Land%20of%20Far-Beyond">The Land of Far-Beyond</a>" (1942) is a Christian parable along the lines of <a href="John%20Bunyan">John Bunyan</a>'s "<a href="The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Progress">The Pilgrim's Progress</a>" (1698), with contemporary children as the main characters. In 1943 she published "The Children's Life of Christ", a collection of fifty-nine short stories related to the <a href="Life%20of%20Jesus%20in%20the%20New%20Testament">life of Jesus</a>, with her own slant on popular biblical stories, from the <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">Nativity</a> and the <a href="Biblical%20Magi">Three Wise Men</a> through to the <a href="Sanhedrin%20trial%20of%20Jesus">trial</a>, the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">crucifixion</a> and the <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">resurrection</a>. "Tales from the Bible" was published the following year, followed by "The Boy with the Loaves and Fishes" in 1948.

The first book of Blyton's <a href="Five%20Find-Outers">Five Find-Outers</a> series, "<a href="The%20Mystery%20of%20the%20Burnt%20Cottage">The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage</a>", was published in 1943, as was the second book in the Faraway series, "<a href="The%20Magic%20Faraway%20Tree%20%28novel%29">The Magic Faraway Tree</a>", which in 2003 was voted 66th in the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s <a href="Big%20Read">Big Read</a> poll to find the UK's favourite book. Several of Blyton's works during this period have seaside themes; "John Jolly by the Sea" (1943), a picture book intended for younger readers, was published in a booklet format by <a href="Evans%20Brothers">Evans Brothers</a>. Other books with a maritime theme include "The Secret of Cliff Castle" and "Smuggler Ben", both attributed to Mary Pollock in 1943; "<a href="The%20Island%20of%20Adventure">The Island of Adventure</a>", the first in the <a href="The%20Adventure%20Series">Adventure series</a> of eight novels from 1944 onwards; and various novels of the Famous Five series such as "Five on a Treasure Island" (1942), "<a href="Five%20on%20Kirrin%20Island%20Again">Five on Kirrin Island Again</a>" (1947) and "<a href="Five%20Go%20Down%20to%20the%20Sea">Five Go Down to the Sea</a>" (1953).

Capitalising on her success, with a loyal and ever-growing readership, Blyton produced a new edition of many of her series such as the Famous Five, the Five Find-Outers and St. Clare's every year in addition to many other novels, short stories and books. In 1946 Blyton launched the first in the <a href="Malory%20Towers">Malory Towers</a> series of six books based around the schoolgirl Darrell Rivers, "<a href="First%20Term%20at%20Malory%20Towers">First Term at Malory Towers</a>", which became extremely popular, particularly with girls.

The first book in Blyton's <a href="The%20Barney%20Mysteries">Barney Mysteries</a> series, "The Rockingdown Mystery", was published in 1949, as was the first of her fifteen <a href="The%20Secret%20Seven">Secret Seven</a> novels. The Secret Seven Society consists of Peter, his sister Janet, and their friends Colin, George, Jack, Pam and Barbara, who meet regularly in a shed in the garden to discuss peculiar events in their local community. Blyton rewrote the stories so they could be adapted into cartoons, which appeared in "Mickey Mouse Weekly" in 1951 with illustrations by George Brook. The French author <a href="Evelyne%20Lallemand">Evelyne Lallemand</a> continued the series in the 1970s, producing an additional twelve books, nine of which were translated into English by <a href="Anthea%20Bell">Anthea Bell</a> between 1983 and 1987.
Blyton's <a href="Noddy%20%28character%29">Noddy</a>, about a little wooden boy from Toyland, first appeared in the "Sunday Graphic" on 5 June 1949, and in November that year "<a href="Noddy%20Goes%20to%20Toyland">Noddy Goes to Toyland</a>", the first of at least two dozen books in the series, was published. The idea was conceived by one of Blyton's publishers, Sampson, Low, Marston and Company, who in 1949 arranged a meeting between Blyton and the Dutch illustrator <a href="Harmsen%20van%20der%20Beek">Harmsen van der Beek</a>. Despite having to communicate via an interpreter, he provided some initial sketches of how Toyland and its characters would be represented. Four days after the meeting Blyton sent the text of the first two Noddy books to her publisher, to be forwarded to van der Beek. The Noddy books became one of her most successful and best-known series, and were hugely popular in the 1950s. An extensive range of sub-series, spin-offs and strip books were produced throughout the decade, including "Noddy's Library", "Noddy's Garage of Books", "Noddy's Castle of Books", "Noddy's Toy Station of Books" and "Noddy's Shop of Books".

In 1950 Blyton established the company Darrell Waters Ltd to manage her affairs. By the early 1950s she had reached the peak of her output, often publishing more than fifty books a year, and she remained extremely prolific throughout much of the decade. By 1955 Blyton had written her fourteenth Famous Five novel, "<a href="Five%20Have%20Plenty%20of%20Fun">Five Have Plenty of Fun</a>", her fifteenth Mary Mouse book, "Mary Mouse in Nursery Rhyme Land", her eighth book in the Adventure series, "<a href="The%20Adventure%20Series%23The%20River%20of%20Adventure">The River of Adventure</a>", and her seventh Secret Seven novel, "<a href="The%20Secret%20Seven%23Secret%20Seven%20Win%20Through%20%281955%29">Secret Seven Win Through</a>". She completed the sixth and final book of the Malory Towers series, "Last Term at Malory Towers", in 1951.

Blyton published several further books featuring the character of Scamp the terrier, following on from "The Adventures of Scamp", a novel she had released in 1943 under the pseudonym of Mary Pollock. "Scamp Goes on Holiday" (1952) and "Scamp and Bimbo", "Scamp at School", "Scamp and Caroline" and "Scamp Goes to the Zoo" (1954) were illustrated by Pierre Probst. She introduced the character of Bom, a stylish toy drummer dressed in a bright red coat and helmet, alongside Noddy in "<a href="TV%20Comic">TV Comic</a>" in July 1956. A book series began the same year with "Bom the Little Toy Drummer", featuring illustrations by R. Paul-Hoye, and followed with "Bom and His Magic Drumstick" (1957), "Bom Goes Adventuring" and "Bom Goes to Ho Ho Village" (1958), "Bom and the Clown" and "Bom and the Rainbow" (1959) and "Bom Goes to Magic Town" (1960). In 1958 she produced two annuals featuring the character, the first of which included twenty short stories, poems and picture strips.

Many of Blyton's series, including Noddy and The Famous Five, continued to be successful in the 1960s; by 1962, 26 million copies of Noddy had been sold. Blyton concluded several of her long-running series in 1963, publishing the last books of The Famous Five ("<a href="Five%20Are%20Together%20Again">Five Are Together Again</a>") and The Secret Seven ("Fun for the Secret Seven"); she also produced three more Brer Rabbit books with the illustrator Grace Lodge: "Brer Rabbit Again", "Brer Rabbit Book", and "Brer Rabbit's a Rascal". In 1962 many of her books were among the first to be published by <a href="Armada%20Books">Armada Books</a> in paperback, making them more affordable to children.

After 1963 Blyton's output was generally confined to short stories and books intended for very young readers, such as "Learn to Count with Noddy" and "Learn to Tell Time with Noddy" in 1965, and "Stories for Bedtime" and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend. Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, "Noddy and the Aeroplane", in February 1964. In May the following year she published "Mixed Bag", a song book with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, "The Man Who Stopped to Help" and "The Boy Who Came Back".

Blyton cemented her reputation as a children's writer when in 1926 she took over the editing of "<a href="Sunny%20Stories">Sunny Stories</a>", a magazine that typically included the re-telling of legends, myths, stories and other articles for children. That same year she was given her own column in "Teachers' World", entitled "From my Window". Three years later she began contributing a weekly page in the magazine, in which she published letters from her <a href="fox%20terrier">fox terrier</a> dog Bobs. They proved to be so popular that in 1933 they were published in book form as "Letters from Bobs", and sold ten thousand copies in the first week. Her most popular feature was "Round the Year with Enid Blyton", which consisted of forty-eight articles covering aspects of natural history such as weather, pond life, how to plant a school garden and how to make a bird table. Among Blyton's other nature projects was her monthly "Country Letter" feature that appeared in "The Nature Lover" magazine in 1935.

"Sunny Stories" was renamed "Enid Blyton's Sunny Stories" in January 1937, and served as a vehicle for the serialisation of Blyton's books. Her first Naughty Amelia Jane story, about an anti-heroine based on a doll owned by her daughter Gillian, was published in the magazine. Blyton stopped contributing in 1952, and it closed down the following year, shortly before the appearance of the new fortnightly "Enid Blyton Magazine" written entirely by Blyton. The first edition appeared on 18 March 1953, and the magazine ran until September 1959.

Noddy made his first appearance in the "<a href="Sunday%20Graphic">Sunday Graphic</a>" in 1949, the same year as Blyton's first daily Noddy <a href="comic%20strip">strip</a> for the London "<a href="London%20Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>". It was illustrated by van der Beek until his death in 1953.

Blyton worked in a wide range of fictional genres, from fairy tales to animal, nature, detective, mystery, and circus stories, but she often "blurred the boundaries" in her books, and encompassed a range of genres even in her short stories. In a 1958 article published in "The Author", she wrote that there were a "dozen or more different types of stories for children", and she had tried them all, but her favourites were those with a family at their centre.

In a letter to the psychologist Peter McKellar, Blyton describes her writing technique:
In another letter to McKellar she describes how in just five days she wrote the 60,000-word book "The River of Adventure", the eighth in her <a href="The%20Adventure%20Series">Adventure Series</a>, by listening to what she referred to as her "under-mind", which she contrasted with her "upper conscious mind". Blyton was unwilling to conduct any research or planning before beginning work on a new book, which coupled with the lack of variety in her life according to Druce almost inevitably presented the danger that she might unconsciously, and clearly did, plagiarise the books she had read, including her own. Gillian has recalled that her mother "never knew where her stories came from", but that she used to talk about them "coming from her 'mind's eye", as did <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a> and <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>. Blyton had "thought it was made up of every experience she'd ever had, everything she's seen or heard or read, much of which had long disappeared from her conscious memory" but never knew the direction her stories would take. Blyton further explained in her biography that "If I tried to think out or invent the whole book, I could not do it. For one thing, it would bore me and for another, it would lack the 'verve' and the extraordinary touches and surprising ideas that flood out from my imagination."

Blyton's daily routine varied little over the years. She usually began writing soon after breakfast, with her portable typewriter on her knee and her favourite red Moroccan shawl nearby; she believed that the colour red acted as a "mental stimulus" for her. Stopping only for a short lunch break she continued writing until five o'clock, by which time she would usually have produced 6,000–10,000 words.

A 2000 article in "<a href="The%20Malay%20Mail">The Malay Mail</a>" considers Blyton's children to have "lived in a world shaped by the realities of post-war austerity", enjoying freedom without the political correctness of today, which serves modern readers of Blyton's novels with a form of escapism. Brandon Robshaw of "The Independent" refers to the Blyton universe as "crammed with colour and character", "self-contained and internally consistent", noting that Blyton exemplifies a strong mistrust of adults and figures of authority in her works, creating a world in which children govern. Gillian noted that in her mother's adventure, detective and school stories for older children, "the hook is the strong storyline with plenty of cliffhangers, a trick she acquired from her years of writing serialised stories for children's magazines. There is always a strong moral framework in which bravery and loyalty are (eventually) rewarded". Blyton herself wrote that "my love of children is the whole foundation of all my work".

Victor Watson, Assistant Director of Research at <a href="Homerton%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Homerton College, Cambridge</a>, believes that Blyton's works reveal an "essential longing and potential associated with childhood", and notes how the opening pages of "The Mountain of Adventure" present a "deeply appealing ideal of childhood". He argues that Blyton's work differs from that of many other authors in its approach, describing the narrative of The Famous Five series for instance as "like a powerful spotlight, it seeks to illuminate, to explain, to demystify. It takes its readers on a roller-coaster story in which the darkness is always banished; everything puzzling, arbitrary, evocative is either dismissed or explained". Watson further notes how Blyton often used minimalist visual descriptions and introduced a few careless phrases such as "gleamed enchantingly" to appeal to her young readers.

From the mid-1950s rumours began to circulate that Blyton had not written all the books attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children to let her know if they heard such stories and, after one mother informed her that she had attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation, Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings. The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated "a 'company' of ghost writers" persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.

Blyton felt a responsibility to provide her readers with a positive moral framework, and she encouraged them to support worthy causes. Her view, expressed in a 1957 article, was that children should help animals and other children rather than adults:
Blyton and the members of the children's clubs she promoted via her magazines raised a great deal of money for various charities; according to Blyton, membership of her clubs meant "working for others, for no reward". The largest of the clubs she was involved with was the Busy Bees, the junior section of the <a href="People%27s%20Dispensary%20for%20Sick%20Animals">People's Dispensary for Sick Animals</a>, which Blyton had actively supported since 1933. The club had been set up by <a href="Maria%20Dickin">Maria Dickin</a> in 1934, and after Blyton publicised its existence in the "Enid Blyton Magazine" it attracted 100,000 members in three years. Such was Blyton's popularity among children that after she became Queen Bee in 1952 more than 20,000 additional members were recruited in her first year in office. The Enid Blyton Magazine Club was formed in 1953. Its primary objective was to raise funds to help those children with <a href="cerebral%20palsy">cerebral palsy</a> who attended a centre in <a href="Cheyne%20Walk">Cheyne Walk</a>, in Chelsea, London, by furnishing an on-site hostel among other things.

The Famous Five series gathered such a following that readers asked Blyton if they might form a fan club. She agreed, on condition that it serve a useful purpose, and suggested that it could raise funds for the Shaftesbury Society Babies' Home in Beaconsfield, on whose committee she had served since 1948. The club was established in 1952, and provided funds for equipping a Famous Five Ward at the home, a <a href="paddling%20pool">paddling pool</a>, sun room, summer house, playground, birthday and Christmas celebrations, and visits to the pantomime. By the late 1950s Blyton's clubs had a membership of 500,000, and raised £35,000 in the six years of the "Enid Blyton Magazine"'s run.

By 1974 the Famous Five Club had a membership of 220,000, and was growing at the rate of 6,000 new members a year. The Beaconsfield home it was set up to support closed in 1967, but the club continued to raise funds for other paediatric charities, including an Enid Blyton bed at <a href="Great%20Ormond%20Street%20Hospital">Great Ormond Street Hospital</a> and a mini-bus for disabled children at <a href="Stoke%20Mandeville%20Hospital">Stoke Mandeville Hospital</a>.

Blyton capitalised upon her commercial success as an author by negotiating agreements with jigsaw puzzle and games manufacturers from the late 1940s onwards; by the early 1960s some 146 different companies were involved in merchandising Noddy alone. In 1948 <a href="Bestime">Bestime</a> released four jigsaw puzzles featuring her characters, and the first Enid Blyton board game appeared, "Journey Through Fairyland", created by BGL. The first card game, Faraway Tree, appeared from Pepys in 1950. In 1954 Bestime released the first four jigsaw puzzles of the Secret Seven, and the following year a Secret Seven card game appeared.

Bestime released the Little Noddy Car Game in 1953 and the Little Noddy Leap Frog Game in 1955, and in 1956 American manufacturer <a href="Parker%20Brothers">Parker Brothers</a> released Little Noddy's Taxi Game, a board game which features Noddy driving about town, picking up various characters. Bestime released its Plywood Noddy Jigsaws series in 1957 and a Noddy jigsaw series featuring cards appeared from 1963, with illustrations by Robert Lee. Arrow Games became the chief producer of Noddy jigsaws in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Whitman manufactured four new Secret Seven jigsaw puzzles in 1975, and produced four new Malory Towers ones two years later. In 1979 the company released a Famous Five adventure board game, Famous Five Kirrin Island Treasure. <a href="Stephen%20Thraves">Stephen Thraves</a> wrote eight Famous Five adventure game books, published by <a href="Hodder%20%26amp%3B%20Stoughton">Hodder & Stoughton</a> in the 1980s. The first adventure game book of the series, "The Wreckers' Tower Game", was published in October 1984.

On 28 August 1924 Blyton married <a href="Major%20%28British%20Army%29">Major</a> <a href="Hugh%20Alexander%20Pollock">Hugh Alexander Pollock</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">DSO</a> (1888–1971) at <a href="Bromley">Bromley</a> Register Office, without inviting her family. They married shortly after he divorced from his first wife, with whom he had two sons. Pollock was editor of the book department in the publishing firm of George Newnes, which became her regular publisher. It was he who requested that Blyton write a book about animals, "The Zoo Book", which was completed in the month before they married. They initially lived in a flat in Chelsea before moving to Elfin Cottage in <a href="Beckenham">Beckenham</a> in 1926, and then to Old Thatch in <a href="Bourne%20End%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Bourne End</a> (called Peterswood in her books) in 1929. Blyton's first daughter <a href="Gillian%20Mary%20Baverstock">Gillian</a>, was born on 15 July 1931, and after a miscarriage in 1934, she gave birth to a second daughter, Imogen, on 27 October 1935.

In 1938 Blyton and her family moved to a house in <a href="Beaconsfield">Beaconsfield</a>, which was named <a href="Green%20Hedges">Green Hedges</a> by Blyton's readers following a competition in her magazine. By the mid-1930s, Pollock – possibly due to the trauma he had suffered during the First World War being revived through his meetings as a publisher with <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> – withdrew increasingly from public life and became a secret alcoholic. With the outbreak of the Second World War, he became involved in the <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Home Guard</a>. Pollock met again <a href="Ida%20Crowe">Ida Crowe</a>, a 19 years younger writer whom he had met years before. He made an offer to her to join him as secretary in his posting to a Home Guard training centre at <a href="Denbies">Denbies</a>, a <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> mansion in Surrey belonging to <a href="Roland%20Cubitt%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Ashcombe">Lord Ashcombe</a>, and they entered into a romantic relationship. Blyton's marriage to Pollock became troubled for years, and according to Crowe's memoir, Blyton began a series of affairs, including a lesbian relationship with one of the children's nannies. In 1941 Blyton met Kenneth Fraser Darrell Waters, a London surgeon with whom she began a serious affair. Pollock discovered the liaison, and threatened to initiate divorce proceedings against Blyton. Fearing that exposure of her adultery would ruin her public image, it was ultimately agreed that Blyton would instead file for divorce against Pollock. According to Crowe's memoir, Blyton promised that if he admitted to infidelity she would allow him parental access to their daughters; but after the divorce he was forbidden to contact them, and Blyton ensured he was subsequently unable to find work in publishing. Pollock, having married Crowe on 26 October 1943, eventually resumed his heavy drinking and was forced to petition for bankruptcy in 1950.

Blyton and Darrell Waters married at the <a href="City%20of%20Westminster">City of Westminster</a> Register Office on 20 October 1943. She changed the surname of her daughters to Darrell Waters and publicly embraced her new role as a happily married and devoted doctor's wife. After discovering she was pregnant in the spring of 1945, Blyton miscarried five months later, following a fall from a ladder. The baby would have been Darrell Waters's first child and it would also have been the son for which both of them longed.

Her love of tennis included playing <a href="naked">naked</a>, with nude tennis "a common practice in those days among the more louche members of the middle classes".

Blyton's health began to deteriorate in 1957, when during a round of golf she started to complain of feeling faint and breathless, and by 1960 she was displaying signs of <a href="dementia">dementia</a>. Her agent George Greenfield recalled that it was "unthinkable" for the "most famous and successful of children's authors with her enormous energy and computer-like memory" to be losing her mind and suffering from what is now known as <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> in her mid-sixties. Blyton's situation was worsened by her husband's declining health throughout the 1960s; he suffered from severe <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a> in his neck and hips, deafness, and became increasingly ill-tempered and erratic until his death on 15 September 1967.

The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled "<a href="Enid%20%28film%29">Enid</a>", which aired in the United Kingdom on <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> on 16 November 2009. <a href="Helena%20Bonham%20Carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a>, who played the title role, described Blyton as "a complete workaholic, an achievement junkie and an extremely canny businesswoman" who "knew how to brand herself, right down to the famous signature".

During the months following her husband's death Blyton became increasingly ill, and moved into a nursing home three months before her death. She died at the Greenways Nursing Home, Hampstead, North London, on 28 November 1968, aged 71. A memorial service was held at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Church%2C%20Piccadilly">St James's Church, Piccadilly</a>, and she was cremated at <a href="Golders%20Green%20Crematorium">Golders Green Crematorium</a>, where her ashes remain. Blyton's home, Green Hedges, was auctioned on 26 May 1971 and demolished in 1973; the site is now occupied by houses and a street named Blyton Close. An <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> commemorates Blyton at Hook Road in <a href="Chessington">Chessington</a>, where she lived from 1920 to 1924. In 2014 a plaque recording her time as a Beaconsfield resident from 1938 until her death in 1968 was unveiled in the town hall gardens, next to small iron figures of Noddy and Big Ears.

Since her death and the publication of her daughter Imogen's 1989 autobiography, "A Childhood at Green Hedges", Blyton has emerged as an emotionally immature, unstable and often malicious figure. Imogen considered her mother to be "arrogant, insecure, pretentious, very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things out of her mind, and without a trace of maternal instinct. As a child, I viewed her as a rather strict authority. As an adult I pitied her." Blyton's eldest daughter Gillian remembered her rather differently however, as "a fair and loving mother, and a fascinating companion".

The Enid Blyton Trust for Children was established in 1982 with Imogen as its first chairman, and in 1985 it established the National Library for the Handicapped Child. "Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine" began publication in September 1985, and on 14 October 1992 the BBC began publishing "Noddy Magazine" and released the Noddy CD-Rom in October 1996.

The first Enid Blyton Day was held at <a href="Rickmansworth">Rickmansworth</a> on 6 March 1993, and in October 1996 the Enid Blyton award, The Enid, was given to those who have made outstanding contributions towards children. The <a href="Enid%20Blyton%20Society">Enid Blyton Society</a> was formed in early 1995, to provide "a focal point for collectors and enthusiasts of Enid Blyton" through its thrice-annual "Enid Blyton Society Journal", its annual Enid Blyton Day, and its website. On 16 December 1996 <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> broadcast a documentary about Blyton, "Secret Lives". To celebrate her centenary in 1997 exhibitions were put on at the London Toy & Model Museum (now closed), <a href="Hereford%20and%20Worcester%20County%20Museum">Hereford and Worcester County Museum</a> and Bromley Library, and on 9 September the <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a> issued centenary stamps.

The London-based entertainment and retail company Trocadero plc purchased Blyton's Darrell Waters Ltd in 1995 for £14.6 million and established a subsidiary, Enid Blyton Ltd, to handle all intellectual properties, character brands and media in Blyton's works. The group changed its name to <a href="Chorion%20%28company%29">Chorion</a> in 1998, but after financial difficulties in 2012 sold its assets. <a href="Hachette%20%28publisher%29">Hachette UK</a> acquired from Chorion world rights in the Blyton estate in March 2013, including The Famous Five series but excluding the rights to Noddy, which had been sold to <a href="DreamWorks%20Classics">DreamWorks Classics</a> (formerly Classic Media, now a subsidiary of DreamWorks Animation) in 2012.

Blyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to celebrate the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; "Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle" (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall. In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, "Mr Tumpy's Caravan", was discovered by the archivist at <a href="Seven%20Stories">Seven Stories</a>, National Centre for Children's Books in a collection of papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by <a href="Seven%20Stories">Seven Stories</a> in 2010 following her death. It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.

In a 1982 survey of 10,000 eleven-year-old children Blyton was voted their most popular writer. She is the <a href="list%20of%20most-translated%20individual%20authors">world's fourth most-translated author</a>, behind <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a>, <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a> and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> with her books being translated into 90 languages. From 2000 to 2010, Blyton was listed as a Top Ten author, selling almost 8 million copies (worth £31.2 million) in the UK alone. In 2003 "<a href="The%20Magic%20Faraway%20Tree">The Magic Faraway Tree</a>" was voted 66 in the BBC's <a href="Big%20Read">Big Read</a>. In the 2008 Costa Book Awards, Blyton was voted Britain's best-loved author. Her books continue to be very popular among children in <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> nations such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malta, New Zealand, and Australia, and around the world. They have also seen a surge of popularity in China, where they are "big with every generation". In March 2004 Chorion and the Chinese publisher Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press negotiated an agreement over the Noddy franchise, which included bringing the character to an animated series on television, with a potential audience of a further 95 million children under the age of five. Chorion spent around £10 million digitising Noddy, and as of 2002 had made television agreements with at least 11 countries worldwide.

Novelists influenced by Blyton include the crime writer <a href="Denise%20Danks">Denise Danks</a>, whose fictional detective Georgina Powers is based on George from the Famous Five. <a href="Peter%20Hunt%20%28literary%20critic%29">Peter Hunt</a>'s "A Step off the Path" (1985) is also influenced by the Famous Five, and the St. Clare's and Malory Towers series provided the inspiration for <a href="Jacqueline%20Wilson">Jacqueline Wilson</a>'s "Double Act" (1996) and <a href="Ad%C3%A8le%20Geras">Adèle Geras</a>'s Egerton Hall trilogy (1990–92) respectively.

A.H. Thompson, who compiled an extensive overview of censorship efforts in the United Kingdom’s public libraries, dedicated an entire chapter to “The Enid Blyton Affair”, and wrote of her in 1975: 

Blyton's range of plots and settings has been described as limited and continually recycled. Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries. Responding to claims that her moral views were "dependably predictable", Blyton commented that "most of you could write down perfectly correctly all the things that I believe in and stand for – you have found them in my books, and a writer's books are always a faithful reflection of himself". 

From the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC operated a "de facto" ban on dramatising Blyton's books for radio, considering her to be a "second-rater" whose work was without literary merit. The children's literary critic <a href="Margery%20Fisher">Margery Fisher</a> likened Blyton's books to "slow poison", and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC's schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton's ability to churn out "mediocre material", noting that "her capacity to do so amounts to genius ... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago". <a href="Michael%20Rosen">Michael Rosen</a>, Children's Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that "I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books." The children's author <a href="Anne%20Fine">Anne Fine</a> presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton's work and responses to them on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> in November 2008, in which she noted the "drip, drip, drip of disapproval" associated with the books. Blyton's response to her critics was that she was uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, claiming that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from "stupid people who don't know what they're talking about because they've never read any of my books".
Despite criticism by contemporaries that her work’s quality began to suffer in the 1950s at the expense of its increasing volume, Blyton nevertheless capitalised on being generally regarded at the time as “a more 'savoury', English alternative” to what some considered an "invasion" of Britain by American culture, in the form of “rock music, horror comics, television, teenage culture, delinquency, and Disney”. 

According to British academic <a href="Nicholas%20Tucker">Nicholas Tucker</a>, the works of Enid Blyton have been “banned from more public libraries over the years than is the case with any other adult or children's author", though such attempts to quell the popularity of her books over the years seem to have been largely unsuccessful, and "she still remains very widely read”.

Some librarians felt that Blyton's restricted use of language, a conscious product of her teaching background, was prejudicial to an appreciation of more literary qualities. In a scathing article published in "Encounter" in 1958, the journalist <a href="Colin%20Welch">Colin Welch</a> remarked that it was "hard to see how a diet of Miss Blyton could help with the <a href="Eleven-Plus%20exam">11-plus</a> or even with the Cambridge English <a href="Tripos">Tripos</a>", but reserved his harshest criticism for Blyton's Noddy, describing him as an "unnaturally priggish ... sanctimonious ... witless, spiritless, snivelling, sneaking doll."

The author and educational psychologist <a href="Nicholas%20Tucker">Nicholas Tucker</a> notes that it was common to see Blyton cited as people's favourite or least favourite author according to their age, and argues that her books create an "encapsulated world for young readers that simply dissolves with age, leaving behind only memories of excitement and strong identification". Fred Inglis considers Blyton's books to be technically easy to read, but to also be "emotionally and cognitively easy". He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton "was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child ... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent ... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas ... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater. If true, such a fact should come as no surprise to us, for as a child herself all other children can be nothing but rivals for her." Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work, with a powerful belief in "representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership". Blyton's daughter Imogen has stated that she "loved a relationship with children through her books", but real children were an intrusion, and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing.

Accusations of racism in Blyton's books were first made by <a href="Lena%20Jeger">Lena Jeger</a> in a "<a href="The%20Guardian">Guardian</a>" article published in 1966, in which she was critical of Blyton's "The Little Black Doll", published a few months earlier. Sambo, the black doll of the title, is hated by his owner and the other toys owing to his "ugly black face", and runs away. A shower of rain washes his face clean, after which he is welcomed back home with his now pink face. <a href="Jamaica%20Kincaid">Jamaica Kincaid</a> also considers the Noddy books to be "deeply racist" because of the blonde children and the black <a href="golliwog">golliwog</a>s. In Blyton's 1944 novel "<a href="The%20Island%20of%20Adventure">The Island of Adventure</a>", a black servant named Jo-Jo is very intelligent, but is particularly cruel to the children.

Accusations of xenophobia were also made. As George Greenfield observed, "Enid was very much part of that between-the-wars middle class which believed that foreigners were untrustworthy or funny or sometimes both". The publisher <a href="Macmillan%20Publishers">Macmillan</a> conducted an internal assessment of Blyton's "The Mystery That Never Was", submitted to them at the height of her fame in 1960. The review was carried out by the author and books editor <a href="Phyllis%20Hartnoll">Phyllis Hartnoll</a>, in whose view "There is a faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia in the author's attitude to the thieves; they are 'foreign' ... and this seems to be regarded as sufficient to explain their criminality." Macmillan rejected the manuscript, but it was published by <a href="William%20Collins%2C%20Sons">William Collins</a> in 1961, and then again in 1965 and 1983.

Blyton's depictions of boys and girls are considered by many critics to be sexist. In a "Guardian" article published in 2005 Lucy Mangan proposed that The Famous Five series depicts a power struggle between Julian, Dick and George (Georgina), in which the female characters either act like boys or are talked down to, as when Dick lectures George: "it's really time you gave up thinking you're as good as a boy".

To address criticisms levelled at Blyton's work some later editions have been altered to reflect more liberal attitudes towards issues such as race, gender and the treatment of children; modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for <a href="golliwogs">golliwogs</a>, for instance. The golliwogs who steal Noddy's car and dump him naked in the Dark Wood in "Here Comes Noddy Again" are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision, who strip Noddy only of his shoes and hat and return at the end of the story to apologise.

"<a href="The%20Faraway%20Tree">The Faraway Tree</a>"'s Dame Slap, who made regular use of corporal punishment, was changed to Dame Snap who no longer did so, and the names of Dick and Fanny in the same series were changed to Rick and Frannie. Characters in the <a href="Malory%20Towers">Malory Towers</a> and <a href="St.%20Clare%27s%20%28series%29">St. Clare's</a> series are no longer <a href="spanking">spanked</a> or threatened with a spanking, but are instead scolded. References to George's short hair making her look like a boy were removed in revisions to "<a href="Five%20on%20a%20Hike%20Together">Five on a Hike Together</a>", reflecting the idea that girls need not have long hair to be considered feminine or normal. Anne of "The Famous Five" stating that boys cannot wear pretty dresses or like girl's dolls was removed. In "<a href="The%20Adventurous%20Four">The Adventurous Four</a>", the names of the young twin girls were changed from Jill and Mary to Pippa and Zoe.

In 2010 <a href="Hodder%20%26amp%3B%20Stoughton">Hodder</a>, the publisher of the Famous Five series, announced its intention to update the language used in the books, of which it sold more than half a million copies a year. The changes, which Hodder described as "subtle", mainly affect the dialogue rather than the narrative. For instance, "school tunic" becomes "uniform", "mother and father" and "mother and daddy" (this latter one used by young female characters and deemed sexist) becomes "mum and dad", "bathing" is replaced by "swimming", and "jersey" by "jumper". Some commentators see the changes as necessary to encourage modern readers, whereas others regard them as unnecessary and patronising. In 2016 Hodder's parent company <a href="Hachette%20%28publisher%29">Hachette</a> announced that they would abandon the revisions as, based on feedback, they had not been a success.

In 1954 Blyton adapted Noddy for the stage, producing the "Noddy in Toyland" pantomime in just two or three weeks. The production was staged at the 2660-seat <a href="Stoll%20Theatre">Stoll Theatre</a> in <a href="Kingsway%20%28London%29">Kingsway</a>, London at Christmas. Its popularity resulted in the show running during the Christmas season for five or six years. Blyton was delighted with its reception by children in the audience, and attended the theatre three or four times a week. <a href="Noddy%20%28character%29%23Television%20productions%20and%20incarnations">TV adaptations of Noddy</a> since 1954 include one in the 1970s narrated by <a href="Richard%20Briers">Richard Briers</a>. In 1955 a stage play based on the Famous Five was produced, and in January 1997 the <a href="King%27s%20Head%20Theatre">King's Head Theatre</a> embarked on a six-month tour of the UK with "The Famous Five Musical", to commemorate Blyton's centenary. On 21 November 1998 "The Secret Seven Save the World" was first performed at the <a href="Sherman%20Cymru">Sherman Theatre</a> in Cardiff.

There have also been several film and television adaptations of the Famous Five: by the <a href="Children%27s%20Film%20Foundation">Children's Film Foundation</a> in <a href="Five%20on%20a%20Treasure%20Island%20%28film%29">1957</a> and <a href="Five%20Have%20a%20Mystery%20to%20Solve%20%28film%29">1964</a>, <a href="Southern%20Television">Southern Television</a> in <a href="The%20Famous%20Five%20%281970s%20TV%20series%29">1978–79</a>, and <a href="Zenith%20Productions">Zenith Productions</a> in <a href="The%20Famous%20Five%20%281990s%20TV%20series%29">1995–97</a>. The series was also adapted for the German film "<a href="Famous%20Five%20%28film%29">Fünf Freunde</a>", directed by Mike Marzuk and released in 2011.

<a href="The%20Comic%20Strip">The Comic Strip</a>, a group of British comedians, produced two extreme parodies of the Famous Five for <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> television: "<a href="Five%20Go%20Mad%20in%20Dorset">Five Go Mad in Dorset</a>", broadcast in 1982, and "Five Go Mad on Mescalin", broadcast the following year. A third in the series, "Five Go to Rehab", was broadcast on <a href="Sky%20%28UK%20and%20Ireland%29">Sky</a> in 2012.

Blyton's "The Faraway Tree" series of books has also been adapted to television and film. On 29 September 1997 the BBC began broadcasting an animated series called "The Enchanted Lands", based on the series. It was announced in October 2014 that a deal had been signed with publishers <a href="Hachette%20Book%20Group%20USA">Hachette</a> for "The Faraway Tree" series to be adapted into a live-action film by director <a href="Sam%20Mendes">Sam Mendes</a>’ production company. Marlene Johnson, head of children’s books at Hachette, said: "Enid Blyton was a passionate advocate of children’s storytelling, and The Magic Faraway Tree is a fantastic example of her creative imagination."

<a href="Seven%20Stories">Seven Stories</a>, the National Centre for Children's Books in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, holds the largest public collection of Blyton's papers and typescripts. The <a href="Seven%20Stories">Seven Stories</a> collection contains a significant number of Blyton's typescripts, including the previously unpublished novel, "Mr Tumpy's Caravan", as well as personal papers and diaries. The purchase of the material in 2010 was made possible by special funding from the <a href="Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund">Heritage Lottery Fund</a>, the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">MLA/V&A Purchase Grant Fund</a>, and two private donations.

Enrico Fermi

Enrico Fermi (; 29 September 1901 – 28 November 1954) was an Italian and naturalized-American physicist and the creator of the world's first <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>, the <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a>. He has been called the "architect of the <a href="Atomic%20Age">nuclear age</a>" and the "architect of the atomic bomb". He was one of very few physicists to excel in both <a href="theoretical%20physics">theoretical physics</a> and <a href="experimental%20physics">experimental physics</a>. Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for his work on <a href="induced%20radioactivity">induced radioactivity</a> by neutron bombardment and for the discovery of <a href="transuranium%20elements">transuranium elements</a>. He made significant contributions to the development of <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a>, <a href="Quantum%20mechanics">quantum theory</a>, and <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear</a> and <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>.

Fermi's first major contribution involved the field of <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a>. After <a href="Wolfgang%20Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a> formulated his <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">exclusion principle</a> in 1925, Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an <a href="ideal%20gas">ideal gas</a>, employing a statistical formulation now known as <a href="Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac%20statistics">Fermi–Dirac statistics</a>. Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called "<a href="fermion">fermion</a>s". Pauli later postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an <a href="electron">electron</a> during <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>, to satisfy the law of <a href="conservation%20of%20energy">conservation of energy</a>. Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle, which he named the "<a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>". His theory, later referred to as <a href="Fermi%27s%20interaction">Fermi's interaction</a> and now called <a href="weak%20interaction">weak interaction</a>, described one of the four <a href="fundamental%20interaction">fundamental interaction</a>s in nature. Through experiments inducing radioactivity with the recently discovered <a href="neutron">neutron</a>, Fermi discovered that <a href="slow%20neutron">slow neutron</a>s were more easily <a href="neutron%20capture">captured</a> by <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nuclei</a> than fast ones, and he developed the <a href="Fermi%20age%20equation">Fermi age equation</a> to describe this. After bombarding <a href="thorium">thorium</a> and <a href="uranium">uranium</a> with slow neutrons, he concluded that he had created new elements. Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, the new elements were later revealed to be <a href="nuclear%20fission%20product">nuclear fission product</a>s.

Fermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new <a href="Italian%20racial%20laws">Italian racial laws</a> that affected his Jewish wife, <a href="Laura%20Capon">Laura Capon</a>. He emigrated to the United States, where he worked on the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> during World War II. Fermi led the team that designed and built Chicago Pile-1, which went <a href="Nuclear%20reactor%20physics%23Criticality">critical</a> on 2 December 1942, demonstrating the first human-created, self-sustaining <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a>. He was on hand when the <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a> at <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, went critical in 1943, and when the <a href="B%20Reactor">B Reactor</a> at the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a> did so the next year. At <a href="Project%20Y">Los Alamos</a>, he headed F Division, part of which worked on <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>'s <a href="Thermonuclear%20fusion">thermonuclear</a> "<a href="History%20of%20the%20Teller%E2%80%93Ulam%20design">Super</a>" bomb. He was present at the <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity test</a> on 16 July 1945, where he used his <a href="Fermi%20problem">Fermi method</a> to estimate the bomb's yield.

After the war, Fermi served under <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a> on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> on nuclear matters. After the detonation of the first Soviet <a href="fission%20bomb">fission bomb</a> in August 1949, he strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 <a href="Oppenheimer%20security%20hearing">hearing</a> that resulted in the denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to <a href="pion">pion</a>s and <a href="muon">muon</a>s, and he speculated that <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s arose when material was accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are <a href="list%20of%20things%20named%20after%20Enrico%20Fermi">named after Fermi</a>, including the <a href="Enrico%20Fermi%20Award">Enrico Fermi Award</a>, the <a href="Enrico%20Fermi%20Institute">Enrico Fermi Institute</a>, the <a href="Fermilab">Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory</a>, the <a href="Fermi%20Gamma-ray%20Space%20Telescope">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a>, the <a href="Enrico%20Fermi%20Nuclear%20Generating%20Station">Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station</a>, and the synthetic element <a href="fermium">fermium</a>, making him one of 16 scientists who have <a href="List%20of%20scientists%20whose%20names%20are%20used%20in%20chemical%20element%20names">elements named after them</a>.

Enrico Fermi was born in Rome, Italy, on 29 September 1901. He was the third child of Alberto Fermi, a division head in the Ministry of Railways, and Ida de Gattis, an elementary school teacher. His sister, Maria, was two years older than he, his brother Giulio a year older. After the two boys were sent to a rural community to be <a href="wet%20nurse">wet nurse</a>d, Enrico rejoined his family in Rome when he was two and a half. Although he was baptised a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> in accordance with his grandparents' wishes, his family was not particularly religious; Enrico was an <a href="Agnosticism">agnostic</a> throughout his adult life. As a young boy he shared the same interests as his brother Giulio, building <a href="electric%20motor">electric motor</a>s and playing with electrical and mechanical toys. Giulio died during an operation on a throat <a href="abscess">abscess</a> in 1915 and Maria died in an airplane crash near <a href="Milan">Milan</a> in 1959.

At a local market Fermi found a physics book, the 900-page "Elementorum physicae mathematicae". Written in Latin by <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> Father , a professor at the <a href="Collegio%20Romano">Collegio Romano</a>, it presented <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="classical%20mechanics">classical mechanics</a>, <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="optics">optics</a>, and <a href="acoustics">acoustics</a> as they were understood at the time of its 1840 publication. With scientifically inclined friend, <a href="Enrico%20Persico">Enrico Persico</a>, Fermi pursued projects such as building <a href="gyroscope">gyroscope</a>s and measuring the acceleration of Earth's <a href="gravity">gravity</a>. A colleague of Fermi's father gave him books on physics and mathematics which he assimilated quickly.

Fermi graduated from high school in July 1918, and at Amidei's urging applied to the "<a href="Scuola%20Normale%20Superiore%20di%20Pisa">Scuola Normale Superiore</a>" in <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a>. Having lost one son, his parents only reluctantly allowed him to live in the school's lodgings for four years. Fermi took first place in the difficult entrance exam, which included an essay on the theme of "Specific characteristics of Sounds"; the 17-year-old Fermi chose to use <a href="Fourier%20analysis">Fourier analysis</a> to derive and solve the <a href="partial%20differential%20equation">partial differential equation</a> for a vibrating rod, and after interviewing Fermi the examiner declared he would become an outstanding physicist.

At the "Scuola Normale Superiore" Fermi played pranks with fellow student <a href="Franco%20Rasetti">Franco Rasetti</a>; the two became close friends and collaborators. Fermi was advised by <a href="Luigi%20Puccianti">Luigi Puccianti</a>, director of the physics laboratory, who said there was little he could teach Fermi and often asked Fermi to teach him something instead. Fermi's knowledge of quantum physics was such that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic. During this time Fermi learned <a href="tensor%20calculus">tensor calculus</a>, a technique key to <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>. Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major, but soon switched to physics. He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, and <a href="atomic%20physics">atomic physics</a>.

In September 1920, Fermi was admitted to the Physics department. Since there were only three students in the department—Fermi, Rasetti, and <a href="Nello%20Carrara">Nello Carrara</a>—Puccianti let them freely use the laboratory for whatever purposes they chose. Fermi decided that they should research <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a>, and the three worked to produce a Laue photograph—an X-ray photograph of a crystal. During 1921, his third year at the university, Fermi published his first scientific works in the Italian journal "<a href="Nuovo%20Cimento">Nuovo Cimento</a>". The first was entitled "On the dynamics of a rigid system of electrical charges in translational motion" ('). A sign of things to come was that the <a href="mass">mass</a> was expressed as a <a href="tensor">tensor</a>—a mathematical construct commonly used to describe something moving and changing in three-dimensional space. In classical mechanics, mass is a <a href="Scalar%20%28physics%29">scalar</a> quantity, but in relativity it changes with velocity. The second paper was "On the electrostatics of a uniform gravitational field of electromagnetic charges and on the weight of electromagnetic charges" ('). Using general relativity, Fermi showed that a charge has a weight equal to U/c, where U was the electrostatic energy of the system, and c is the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>.

The first paper seemed to point out a contradiction between the electrodynamic theory and the relativistic one concerning the calculation of the electromagnetic masses, as the former predicted a value of 4/3 U/c. Fermi addressed this the next year in a paper "Concerning a contradiction between <a href="electrodynamic">electrodynamic</a> and the relativistic theory of electromagnetic mass" in which he showed that the apparent contradiction was a consequence of relativity. This paper was sufficiently well-regarded that it was translated into German and published in the German scientific journal "<a href="Physikalische%20Zeitschrift">Physikalische Zeitschrift</a>" in 1922. That year, Fermi submitted his article "On the phenomena occurring near a <a href="world%20line">world line</a>" (') to the Italian journal '. In this article he examined the <a href="Principle%20of%20Equivalence">Principle of Equivalence</a>, and introduced the so-called "<a href="Fermi%20coordinates">Fermi coordinates</a>". He proved that on a world line close to the time line, space behaves as if it were a <a href="Euclidean%20space">Euclidean space</a>.
Fermi submitted his thesis, "A theorem on probability and some of its applications" (""), to the "Scuola Normale Superiore" in July 1922, and received his <a href="Laurea%23Former%20status%20of%20the%20Laurea%20degree">laurea</a> at the unusually young age of 20. The thesis was on <a href="X-ray%20diffraction">X-ray diffraction</a> images. <a href="Theoretical%20physics">Theoretical physics</a> was not yet considered a discipline in Italy, and the only thesis that would have been accepted was one on <a href="experimental%20physics">experimental physics</a>. For this reason, Italian physicists were slow in embracing the new ideas like relativity coming from Germany. Since Fermi was quite at home in the lab doing experimental work, this did not pose insurmountable problems for him.

While writing the appendix for the Italian edition of the book "Fundamentals of Einstein Relativity" by <a href="August%20Kopff">August Kopff</a> in 1923, Fermi was the first to point out that hidden inside the famous <a href="Mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">Einstein equation</a> () was an enormous amount of <a href="nuclear%20potential%20energy">nuclear potential energy</a> to be exploited. "It does not seem possible, at least in the near future", he wrote, "to find a way to release these dreadful amounts of energy—which is all to the good because the first effect of an explosion of such a dreadful amount of energy would be to smash into smithereens the physicist who had the misfortune to find a way to do it."

In 1924 Fermi was initiated into the <a href="Masonic%20Lodge">Masonic Lodge</a> "Adriano Lemmi" of the <a href="Grand%20Orient%20of%20Italy">Grand Orient of Italy</a>.

Fermi spent a semester studying under <a href="Max%20Born">Max Born</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">University of Göttingen</a>, where he met <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a> and <a href="Pascual%20Jordan">Pascual Jordan</a>. Fermi then studied in <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a> with <a href="Paul%20Ehrenfest">Paul Ehrenfest</a> from September to December 1924 on a fellowship from the <a href="Rockefeller%20Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a> obtained through the intercession of the mathematician <a href="Vito%20Volterra">Vito Volterra</a>. Here Fermi met <a href="Hendrik%20Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a> and <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, and became good friends with <a href="Samuel%20Goudsmit">Samuel Goudsmit</a> and <a href="Jan%20Tinbergen">Jan Tinbergen</a>. From January 1925 to late 1926, Fermi taught <a href="mathematical%20physics">mathematical physics</a> and <a href="theoretical%20mechanics">theoretical mechanics</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Florence">University of Florence</a>, where he teamed up with Rasetti to conduct a series of experiments on the effects of magnetic fields on mercury vapour. He also participated in seminars at the Sapienza University of Rome, giving lectures on quantum mechanics and <a href="solid%20state%20physics">solid state physics</a>. While giving lectures on the new quantum mechanics based on the remarkable accuracy of predictions of the Schrödinger equation, the Italian physicist would often say, "It has no business to fit so well!"

After <a href="Wolfgang%20Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a> announced his <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">exclusion principle</a> in 1925, Fermi responded with a paper "On the quantisation of the perfect monoatomic gas" ("), in which he applied the exclusion principle to an ideal gas. The paper was especially notable for Fermi's statistical formulation, which describes the distribution of particles in <a href="physical%20system">systems</a> of many <a href="identical%20particles">identical particles</a> that obey the exclusion principle. This was independently developed soon after by the British physicist <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>, who also showed how it was related to the <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20statistics">Bose–Einstein statistics</a>. Accordingly, it is now known as <a href="Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac%20statistics">Fermi–Dirac statistics</a>. After Dirac, particles that obey the exclusion principle are today called "<a href="fermion">fermion</a>s", while those that do not are called "<a href="boson">boson</a>s".

Professorships in Italy were granted by competition (") for a vacant chair, the applicants being rated on their publications by a committee of professors. Fermi applied for a chair of mathematical physics at the <a href="University%20of%20Cagliari">University of Cagliari</a> on <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, but was narrowly passed over in favour of <a href="Giovanni%20Giorgi">Giovanni Giorgi</a>. In 1926, at the age of 24, he applied for a professorship at the <a href="Sapienza%20University%20of%20Rome">Sapienza University of Rome</a>. This was a new chair, one of the first three in theoretical physics in Italy, that had been created by the Minister of Education at the urging of Professor <a href="Orso%20Mario%20Corbino">Orso Mario Corbino</a>, who was the University's professor of experimental physics, the Director of the Institute of Physics, and a member of <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>'s cabinet. Corbino, who also chaired the selection committee, hoped that the new chair would raise the standard and reputation of physics in Italy. The committee chose Fermi ahead of Enrico Persico and <a href="Aldo%20Pontremoli">Aldo Pontremoli</a>, and Corbino helped Fermi recruit his team, which was soon joined by notable students such as <a href="Edoardo%20Amaldi">Edoardo Amaldi</a>, <a href="Bruno%20Pontecorvo">Bruno Pontecorvo</a>, <a href="Ettore%20Majorana">Ettore Majorana</a> and <a href="Emilio%20Segr%C3%A8">Emilio Segrè</a>, and by Franco Rasetti, whom Fermi had appointed as his assistant. They were soon nicknamed the "<a href="Via%20Panisperna%20boys">Via Panisperna boys</a>" after the street where the Institute of Physics was located.

Fermi married <a href="Laura%20Capon">Laura Capon</a>, a science student at the University, on 19 July 1928. They had two children: Nella, born in January 1931, and Giulio, born in February 1936. On 18 March 1929, Fermi was appointed a member of the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Italy">Royal Academy of Italy</a> by Mussolini, and on 27 April he joined the <a href="Fascist%20Party">Fascist Party</a>. He later opposed Fascism when the 1938 <a href="Italian%20Racial%20Laws">racial laws</a> were promulgated by Mussolini in order to bring Italian Fascism ideologically closer to German <a href="National%20Socialism">National Socialism</a>. These laws threatened Laura, who was Jewish, and put many of Fermi's research assistants out of work.

During their time in Rome, Fermi and his group made important contributions to many practical and theoretical aspects of physics. In 1928, he published his "Introduction to Atomic Physics" (""), which provided Italian university students with an up-to-date and accessible text. Fermi also conducted public lectures and wrote popular articles for scientists and teachers in order to spread knowledge of the new physics as widely as possible. Part of his teaching method was to gather his colleagues and graduate students together at the end of the day and go over a problem, often from his own research. A sign of success was that foreign students now began to come to Italy. The most notable of these was the German physicist <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a>, who came to Rome as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow, and collaborated with Fermi on a 1932 paper "On the Interaction between Two Electrons" ().

At this time, physicists were puzzled by <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>, in which an <a href="electron">electron</a> was emitted from the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a>. To satisfy the law of <a href="conservation%20of%20energy">conservation of energy</a>, Pauli postulated the existence of an invisible particle with no charge and little or no mass that was also emitted at the same time. Fermi took up this idea, which he developed in a tentative paper in 1933, and then a longer paper the next year that incorporated the postulated particle, which Fermi called a "<a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>". His theory, later referred to as <a href="Fermi%27s%20interaction">Fermi's interaction</a>, and still later as the theory of the <a href="weak%20interaction">weak interaction</a>, described one of the four <a href="fundamental%20forces%20of%20nature">fundamental forces of nature</a>. The neutrino was detected after his death, and his interaction theory showed why it was so difficult to detect. When he submitted his paper to the British journal "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>", that journal's editor turned it down because it contained speculations which were "too remote from physical reality to be of interest to readers". Thus Fermi saw the theory published in Italian and German before it was published in English.

In the introduction to the 1968 English translation, physicist Fred L. Wilson noted that:

In January 1934, <a href="Ir%C3%A8ne%20Joliot-Curie">Irène Joliot-Curie</a> and <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Joliot">Frédéric Joliot</a> announced that they had bombarded elements with <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s and induced <a href="radioactivity">radioactivity</a> in them. By March, Fermi's assistant <a href="Gian-Carlo%20Wick">Gian-Carlo Wick</a> had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the <a href="neutron">neutron</a>, which <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi wanted to see if he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's <a href="polonium">polonium</a>-<a href="beryllium">beryllium</a> <a href="neutron%20source">neutron source</a>. Neutrons had no electric charge, and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.
Fermi had the idea to resort to replacing the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a <a href="radon">radon</a>-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 m<a href="Curie">Ci</a> of radon gas, supplied by <a href="Giulio%20Cesare%20Trabacchi">Giulio Cesare Trabacchi</a>. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of radon. He knew that this source would also emit <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s, but, on the basis of his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding <a href="platinum">platinum</a>, an element with a high <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> that was readily available, without success. He turned to <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, which emitted an alpha particle and produced <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, which then decayed into <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> by beta particle emission. He tried <a href="lead">lead</a>, without success, and then <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a> in the form of <a href="calcium%20fluoride">calcium fluoride</a>, which emitted an alpha particle and produced <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, decaying into <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> by beta particle emission. In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal "La Ricerca Scientifica" on 25 March 1934.

The natural radioactivity of <a href="thorium">thorium</a> and <a href="uranium">uranium</a> made it hard to determine what was happening when these elements were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of elements lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new elements, which he called <a href="hesperium">hesperium</a> and <a href="ausonium">ausonium</a>. The chemist <a href="Ida%20Noddack">Ida Noddack</a> suggesting that some of the experiments could have produced lighter elements than lead rather than new, heavier elements. Her suggestion was not taken seriously at the time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium or build the theoretical basis for this possibility. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected elements with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter elements, nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.
The Via Panisperna boys also noticed some unexplained effects. The experiment seemed to work better on a wooden table than a marble table top. Fermi remembered that Joliot-Curie and Chadwick had noted that <a href="paraffin%20wax">paraffin wax</a> was effective at slowing neutrons, so he decided to try that. When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax, they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in <a href="silver">silver</a> compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin. Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin. Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops. This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water. He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons. The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with, the more energy a neutron loses per collision, and therefore the fewer collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount. Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because <a href="slow%20neutron">slow neutron</a>s were more easily <a href="neutron%20capture">captured</a> than fast ones. He developed a <a href="diffusion%20equation">diffusion equation</a> to describe this, which became known as the <a href="Fermi%20age%20equation">Fermi age equation</a>.

In 1938 Fermi received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> at the age of 37 for his "demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of <a href="nuclear%20reaction">nuclear reaction</a>s brought about by slow neutrons". After Fermi received the prize in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, he did not return home to Italy, but rather continued to New York City with his family in December 1938, where they applied for permanent residency. The decision to move to America and become U.S. citizens was due primarily to the racial laws in Italy.

Fermi arrived in New York City on 2 January 1939. He was immediately offered positions at five universities, and accepted one at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, where he had already given summer lectures in 1936. He received the news that in December 1938, the German chemists <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> had detected the element <a href="barium">barium</a> after bombarding uranium with neutrons, which <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and her nephew <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a> correctly interpreted as the result of <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a>. Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939. The news of Meitner and Frisch's interpretation of Hahn and Strassmann's discovery crossed the Atlantic with <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a>, who was to lecture at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>. <a href="Isidor%20Isaac%20Rabi">Isidor Isaac Rabi</a> and <a href="Willis%20Lamb">Willis Lamb</a>, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton, found out about it and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Enrico Fermi, but Fermi later gave the credit to Lamb:
Noddack was proven right after all. Fermi had dismissed the possibility of fission on the basis of his calculations, but he had not taken into account the <a href="binding%20energy">binding energy</a> that would appear when a <a href="nuclide">nuclide</a> with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the <a href="transuranic%20elements">transuranic elements</a> that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but <a href="fission%20products">fission products</a>. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.
The scientists at Columbia decided that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium when bombarded by neutrons. On 25 January 1939, in the basement of <a href="Pupin%20Hall">Pupin Hall</a> at Columbia, an experimental team including Fermi conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States. The other members of the team were <a href="Herbert%20L.%20Anderson">Herbert L. Anderson</a>, <a href="Eugene%20T.%20Booth">Eugene T. Booth</a>, <a href="John%20R.%20Dunning">John R. Dunning</a>, <a href="G.%20N.%20Glasoe">G. Norris Glasoe</a>, and <a href="Francis%20G.%20Slack">Francis G. Slack</a>. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C. under the joint auspices of <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a> and the <a href="Carnegie%20Institution%20of%20Washington">Carnegie Institution of Washington</a>. There, the news on nuclear fission was spread even further, fostering many more experimental demonstrations.

French scientists <a href="Hans%20von%20Halban">Hans von Halban</a>, <a href="Lew%20Kowarski">Lew Kowarski</a>, and <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Joliot-Curie">Frédéric Joliot-Curie</a> had demonstrated that uranium bombarded by neutrons emitted more neutrons than it absorbed, suggesting the possibility of a chain reaction. Fermi and Anderson did so too a few weeks later. <a href="Le%C3%B3%20Szil%C3%A1rd">Leó Szilárd</a> obtained of <a href="uranium%20oxide">uranium oxide</a> from Canadian <a href="radium">radium</a> producer <a href="Eldorado%20Mining%20and%20Refining%20Limited">Eldorado Gold Mines Limited</a>, allowing Fermi and Anderson to conduct experiments with fission on a much larger scale. Fermi and Szilárd collaborated on a design of a device to achieve a self-sustaining nuclear reaction—a <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>. Owing to the rate of absorption of neutrons by the hydrogen in water, it was unlikely that a self-sustaining reaction could be achieved with natural uranium and water as a <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>. Fermi suggested, based on his work with neutrons, that the reaction could be achieved with uranium oxide blocks and <a href="graphite">graphite</a> as a moderator instead of water. This would reduce the neutron capture rate, and in theory make a self-sustaining chain reaction possible. Szilárd came up with a workable design: a pile of uranium oxide blocks interspersed with graphite bricks. Szilárd, Anderson, and Fermi published a paper on "Neutron Production in Uranium". But their work habits and personalities were different, and Fermi had trouble working with Szilárd.

Fermi was among the first to warn military leaders about the potential impact of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on the subject at the <a href="Navy%20Department">Navy Department</a> on 18 March 1939. The response fell short of what he had hoped for, although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia. Later that year, Szilárd, <a href="Eugene%20Wigner">Eugene Wigner</a>, and <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a> sent <a href="Einstein%E2%80%93Szil%C3%A1rd%20letter">the famous letter signed by Einstein</a> to <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">U.S. President Roosevelt</a>, warning that <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> was likely to build an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>. In response, Roosevelt formed the <a href="Advisory%20Committee%20on%20Uranium">Advisory Committee on Uranium</a> to investigate the matter.
The Advisory Committee on Uranium provided money for Fermi to buy graphite, and he built a pile of graphite bricks on the seventh floor of the Pupin Hall laboratory. By August 1941, he had six tons of uranium oxide and thirty tons of graphite, which he used to build a still larger pile in Schermerhorn Hall at Columbia.

The S-1 Section of the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a>, as the Advisory Committee on Uranium was now known, met on 18 December 1941, with the U.S. now engaged in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, making its work urgent. Most of the effort sponsored by the Committee had been directed at producing <a href="enriched%20uranium">enriched uranium</a>, but Committee member <a href="Arthur%20Compton">Arthur Compton</a> determined that a feasible alternative was <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>, which could be mass-produced in nuclear reactors by the end of 1944. He decided to concentrate the plutonium work at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>. Fermi reluctantly moved, and his team became part of the new <a href="Metallurgical%20Laboratory">Metallurgical Laboratory</a> there.

The possible results of a self-sustaining nuclear reaction were unknown, so it seemed inadvisable to build the first nuclear reactor on the University of Chicago campus in the middle of the city. Compton found a location in the Argonne Woods Forest Preserve, about from Chicago. <a href="Stone%20%26amp%3B%20Webster">Stone & Webster</a> was contracted to develop the site, but the work was halted by an industrial dispute. Fermi then persuaded Compton that he could build the reactor in the <a href="squash%20%28sport%29">squash</a> court under the stands of the University of Chicago's <a href="Stagg%20Field">Stagg Field</a>. Construction of the pile began on 6 November 1942, and <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a> went <a href="Nuclear%20reactor%20physics%23Criticality">critical</a> on 2 December. The shape of the pile was intended to be roughly spherical, but as work proceeded Fermi calculated that criticality could be achieved without finishing the entire pile as planned.

This experiment was a landmark in the quest for energy, and it was typical of Fermi's approach. Every step was carefully planned, every calculation meticulously done. When the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction was achieved, Compton made a coded phone call to <a href="James%20B.%20Conant">James B. Conant</a>, the chairman of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a>.
To continue the research where it would not pose a public health hazard, the reactor was disassembled and moved to the Argonne Woods site. There Fermi directed experiments on nuclear reactions, revelling in the opportunities provided by the reactor's abundant production of free neutrons. The laboratory soon branched out from physics and engineering into using the reactor for biological and medical research. Initially, Argonne was run by Fermi as part of the University of Chicago, but it became a separate entity with Fermi as its director in May 1944.

When the air-cooled <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a> at <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge</a> went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi was on hand just in case something went wrong. The technicians woke him early so that he could see it happen. Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a> staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium. Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.

In September 1944, Fermi inserted the first uranium fuel slug into the <a href="B%20Reactor">B Reactor</a> at the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a>, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, it had been designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the <a href="control%20rod">control rod</a>s to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to <a href="neutron%20poison">neutron poison</a>ing from <a href="xenon-135">xenon-135</a>, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that if all 2,004 tubes were loaded, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.
In mid-1944, <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> persuaded Fermi to join his <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Project Y</a> at <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>. Arriving in September, Fermi was appointed an associate director of the laboratory, with broad responsibility for nuclear and theoretical physics, and was placed in charge of F Division, which was named after him. F Division had four branches: F-1 Super and General Theory under Teller, which investigated the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Teller%E2%80%93Ulam%20design">"Super" (thermonuclear) bomb</a>; F-2 Water Boiler under L. D. P. King, which looked after the "water boiler" <a href="Aqueous%20homogeneous%20reactor">aqueous homogeneous</a> <a href="research%20reactor">research reactor</a>; F-3 Super Experimentation under <a href="Egon%20Bretscher">Egon Bretscher</a>; and F-4 Fission Studies under Anderson. Fermi observed the <a href="Trinity%20test">Trinity test</a> on 16 July 1945, and conducted an experiment to estimate the bomb's yield by dropping strips of paper into the blast wave. He paced off the distance they were blown by the explosion, and calculated the yield as ten kilotons of TNT; the actual yield was about 18.6 kilotons.

Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and <a href="Ernest%20Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a>, Fermi was part of the scientific panel that advised the <a href="Interim%20Committee">Interim Committee</a> on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> from the <a href="public%20address%20system">public address system</a> in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for <a href="world%20government">world government</a>. He therefore did not join the <a href="Association%20of%20Los%20Alamos%20Scientists">Association of Los Alamos Scientists</a>.

Fermi became the Charles H. Swift Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago on 1 July 1945, although he did not depart the Los Alamos Laboratory with his family until 31 December 1945. He was elected a member of the <a href="U.S.%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">U.S. National Academy of Sciences</a> in 1945. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the <a href="Argonne%20National%20Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a> on 1 July 1946, the first of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy%20National%20Laboratories">national laboratories</a> established by the Manhattan Project. The short distance between Chicago and Argonne allowed Fermi to work at both places. At Argonne he continued experimental physics, investigating <a href="neutron%20scattering">neutron scattering</a> with <a href="Leona%20Marshall">Leona Marshall</a>. He also discussed theoretical physics with <a href="Maria%20Mayer">Maria Mayer</a>, helping her develop insights into <a href="Spin%E2%80%93orbit%20interaction">spin–orbit coupling</a> that would lead to her receiving the Nobel Prize.

The Manhattan Project was replaced by the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC) on 1 January 1947. Fermi served on the AEC General Advisory Committee, an influential scientific committee chaired by Robert Oppenheimer. He also liked to spend a few weeks of each year at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he collaborated with <a href="Nicholas%20Metropolis">Nicholas Metropolis</a>, and with <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a> on <a href="Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor%20instability">Rayleigh–Taylor instability</a>, the science of what occurs at the border between two fluids of different densities.
After the detonation of the first Soviet <a href="fission%20bomb">fission bomb</a> in August 1949, Fermi, along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the committee, opposing the development of a hydrogen bomb on moral and technical grounds. Nonetheless, Fermi continued to participate in work on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with <a href="Stanislaw%20Ulam">Stanislaw Ulam</a>, he calculated that not only would the amount of <a href="tritium">tritium</a> needed for Teller's model of a thermonuclear weapon be prohibitive, but a <a href="Nuclear%20fusion">fusion reaction</a> could still not be assured to propagate even with this large quantity of tritium. Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the <a href="Oppenheimer%20security%20hearing">Oppenheimer security hearing</a> in 1954 that resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance.

In his later years, Fermi continued teaching at the University of Chicago. His PhD students in the post-war period included <a href="Owen%20Chamberlain">Owen Chamberlain</a>, <a href="Geoffrey%20Chew">Geoffrey Chew</a>, <a href="Jerome%20Isaac%20Friedman">Jerome Friedman</a>, <a href="Marvin%20Goldberger">Marvin Goldberger</a>, <a href="Tsung-Dao%20Lee">Tsung-Dao Lee</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Rosenfeld">Arthur Rosenfeld</a> and <a href="Sam%20Treiman">Sam Treiman</a>. <a href="Jack%20Steinberger">Jack Steinberger</a> was a graduate student, and <a href="Mildred%20Dresselhaus">Mildred Dresselhaus</a> was highly influenced by Fermi during the year she overlapped with him as a PhD student. Fermi conducted important research in particle physics, especially related to <a href="pion">pion</a>s and <a href="muon">muon</a>s. He made the first predictions of pion-<a href="nucleon">nucleon</a> resonance, relying on <a href="statistical%20methods">statistical methods</a>, since he reasoned that exact answers were not required when the theory was wrong anyway. In a paper co-authored with <a href="Chen%20Ning%20Yang">Chen Ning Yang</a>, he speculated that pions might actually be composite particles. The idea was elaborated by <a href="Shoichi%20Sakata">Shoichi Sakata</a>. It has since been supplanted by the <a href="quark%20model">quark model</a>, in which the pion is made up of quarks, which completed Fermi's model, and vindicated his approach.

Fermi wrote a paper "On the Origin of <a href="cosmic%20radiation">Cosmic Radiation</a>" in which he proposed that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space, which led to a difference of opinion with Teller. Fermi examined the issues surrounding magnetic fields in the arms of a <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a>. He mused about what is now referred to as the "<a href="Fermi%20paradox">Fermi paradox</a>": the contradiction between the presumed probability of the existence of extraterrestrial life and the fact that contact has not been made.
Toward the end of his life, Fermi questioned his faith in society at large to make wise choices about nuclear technology. He said:

Fermi underwent an exploratory operation in Billings Memorial Hospital in October 1954, after which he returned home. Fifty days later died of <a href="stomach%20cancer">stomach cancer</a> at age 53 in his home in Chicago. His memorial service was held at the <a href="Rockefeller%20Chapel">University of Chicago chapel</a>, where colleagues <a href="Samuel%20K.%20Allison">Samuel K. Allison</a>, Emilio Segrè, and Herbert L. Anderson spoke to mourn the loss of one of the world's "most brilliant and productive physicists." His body was interred at <a href="Oak%20Woods%20Cemetery">Oak Woods Cemetery</a>.

Fermi received numerous awards in recognition of his achievements, including the <a href="Matteucci%20Medal">Matteucci Medal</a> in 1926, the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1938, the <a href="Hughes%20Medal">Hughes Medal</a> in 1942, the <a href="Franklin%20Medal">Franklin Medal</a> in 1947, and the <a href="Rumford%20Prize">Rumford Prize</a> in 1953. He was awarded the <a href="Medal%20for%20Merit">Medal for Merit</a> in 1946 for his contribution to the Manhattan Project. Fermi was elected a <a href="List%20of%20Fellows%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20elected%20in%201950">Foreign Member of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1950</a>. The <a href="Basilica%20of%20Santa%20Croce">Basilica of Santa Croce</a>, <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, known as the "Temple of Italian Glories" for its many graves of artists, scientists and prominent figures in Italian history, has a plaque commemorating Fermi. In 1999, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" named Fermi on its list of the top 100 persons of the twentieth century. Fermi was widely regarded as an unusual case of a 20th-century physicist who excelled both theoretically and experimentally. The historian of physics, <a href="C.%20P.%20Snow">C. P. Snow</a>, wrote that "if Fermi had been born a few years earlier, one could well imagine him discovering <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Rutherford's</a> atomic nucleus, and then developing <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr's theory</a> of the hydrogen atom. If this sounds like hyperbole, anything about Fermi is likely to sound like hyperbole".

Fermi was known as an inspiring teacher, and was noted for his attention to detail, simplicity, and careful preparation of his lectures. Later, his lecture notes were transcribed into books. His papers and notebooks are today in the University of Chicago. <a href="Victor%20Weisskopf">Victor Weisskopf</a> noted how Fermi "always managed to find the simplest and most direct approach, with the minimum of complication and sophistication." Fermi's ability and success stemmed as much from his appraisal of the art of the possible, as from his innate skill and intelligence. He disliked complicated theories, and while he had great mathematical ability, he would never use it when the job could be done much more simply. He was famous for getting quick and accurate answers to problems that would stump other people. Later on, his method of getting approximate and quick answers through back-of-the-envelope calculations became informally known as the "<a href="Fermi%20problem">Fermi method</a>", and is widely taught.

Fermi was fond of pointing out that <a href="Alessandro%20Volta">Alessandro Volta</a>, working in his laboratory, could have had no idea where the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of <a href="quark">quark</a>s and <a href="lepton">lepton</a>s.

Many things bear Fermi's name. These include the <a href="Fermilab">Fermilab</a> particle accelerator and physics lab in <a href="Batavia%2C%20Illinois">Batavia, Illinois</a>, which was renamed in his honor in 1974, and the <a href="Fermi%20Gamma-ray%20Space%20Telescope">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a>, which was named after him in 2008, in recognition of his work on cosmic rays. Three nuclear reactor installations have been named after him: the <a href="Fermi%201">Fermi 1</a> and <a href="Fermi%202">Fermi 2</a> nuclear power plants in <a href="Newport%2C%20Michigan">Newport, Michigan</a>, the <a href="Enrico%20Fermi%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant%20%28Italy%29">Enrico Fermi Nuclear Power Plant</a> at <a href="Trino%20Vercellese">Trino Vercellese</a> in Italy, and the <a href="RA-1%20Enrico%20Fermi">RA-1 Enrico Fermi</a> research reactor in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. A synthetic element isolated from the debris of the 1952 <a href="Ivy%20Mike">Ivy Mike</a> nuclear test was named <a href="fermium">fermium</a>, in honor of Fermi's contributions to the scientific community. This makes him one of 16 scientists who have <a href="List%20of%20scientists%20whose%20names%20are%20used%20in%20chemical%20element%20names">elements named after them</a>.

Since 1956, the United States Atomic Energy Commission has named its highest honor, the <a href="Fermi%20Award">Fermi Award</a>, after him. Recipients of the award include well-known scientists like Otto Hahn, Robert Oppenheimer, Edward Teller and Hans Bethe.

Euclidean algorithm

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, the Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid's algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the <a href="greatest%20common%20divisor">greatest common divisor</a> (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a <a href="remainder">remainder</a>. It is named after the ancient Greek <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a>, who first described it in <a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">his "Elements"</a> (c. 300 BC).
It is an example of an "<a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>", a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules,
and is one of the oldest algorithms in common use. It can be used to reduce <a href="Fraction%20%28mathematics%29">fraction</a>s to their <a href="Irreducible%20fraction">simplest form</a>, and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations.

The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number. For example, 21 is the GCD of 252 and 105 (as 252 = 21 × 12 and 105 = 21 × 5), and the same number 21 is also the GCD of 105 and 252 − 105 = 147. Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers, repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal. When that occurs, they are the GCD of the original two numbers. By <a href="extended%20Euclidean%20algorithm">reversing the steps</a>, the GCD can be expressed as a <a href="linear%20combination">sum</a> of the two original numbers each multiplied by a positive or negative <a href="integer">integer</a>, e.g., 21 = 5 × 105 + (−2) × 252. The fact that the GCD can always be expressed in this way is known as <a href="B%C3%A9zout%27s%20identity">Bézout's identity</a>.

The version of the Euclidean algorithm described above (and by Euclid) can take many subtraction steps to find the GCD when one of the given numbers is much bigger than the other. A more efficient version of the algorithm shortcuts these steps, instead replacing the larger of the two numbers by its remainder when divided by the smaller of the two (with this version, the algorithm stops when reaching a zero remainder). With this improvement, the algorithm never requires more steps than five times the number of digits (base 10) of the smaller integer. This was proven by <a href="Gabriel%20Lam%C3%A9">Gabriel Lamé</a> in 1844, and marks the beginning of <a href="computational%20complexity%20theory">computational complexity theory</a>. Additional methods for improving the algorithm's efficiency were developed in the 20th century.

The Euclidean algorithm has many theoretical and practical applications. It is used for reducing <a href="Fraction%20%28mathematics%29">fraction</a>s to their <a href="Irreducible%20fraction">simplest form</a> and for performing <a href="Division%20%28mathematics%29">division</a> in <a href="modular%20arithmetic">modular arithmetic</a>. Computations using this algorithm form part of the <a href="cryptographic%20protocol">cryptographic protocol</a>s that are used to secure <a href="internet">internet</a> communications, and in methods for breaking these cryptosystems by <a href="integer%20factorization">factoring large composite numbers</a>. The Euclidean algorithm may be used to solve <a href="Diophantine%20equation">Diophantine equation</a>s, such as finding numbers that satisfy multiple congruences according to the <a href="Chinese%20remainder%20theorem">Chinese remainder theorem</a>, to construct <a href="continued%20fraction">continued fraction</a>s, and to find accurate <a href="Diophantine%20approximation">rational approximations</a> to real numbers. Finally, it can be used as a basic tool for proving theorems in <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a> such as <a href="Lagrange%27s%20four-square%20theorem">Lagrange's four-square theorem</a> and the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20arithmetic">uniqueness of prime factorizations</a>. The original algorithm was described only for natural numbers and geometric lengths (real numbers), but the algorithm was generalized in the 19th century to other types of numbers, such as <a href="Gaussian%20integer">Gaussian integer</a>s and <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a>s of one variable. This led to modern <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>ic notions such as <a href="Euclidean%20domain">Euclidean domain</a>s.

The Euclidean algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s "a" and "b". The greatest common divisor "g" is the largest natural number that divides both "a" and "b" without leaving a remainder. Synonyms for the GCD include the "greatest common factor" (GCF), the "highest common factor" (HCF), the "highest common divisor" (HCD), and the "greatest common measure" (GCM). The greatest common divisor is often written as gcd("a", "b") or, more simply, as ("a", "b"), although the latter notation is ambiguous, also used for concepts such as an <a href="Ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideal</a> in the <a href="ring%20of%20integers">ring of integers</a>, which is closely related to GCD.

If gcd("a", "b") = 1, then "a" and "b" are said to be <a href="Coprime%20integers">coprime</a> (or relatively prime). This property does not imply that "a" or "b" are themselves <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s. For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number, since they both have two prime factors: 6 = 2 × 3 and 35 = 5 × 7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. No natural number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.

Let "g" = gcd("a", "b"). Since "a" and "b" are both multiples of "g", they can be written "a" = "mg" and "b" = "ng", and there is no larger number "G" > "g" for which this is true. The natural numbers "m" and "n" must be coprime, since any common factor could be factored out of "m" and "n" to make "g" greater. Thus, any other number "c" that divides both "a" and "b" must also divide "g". The greatest common divisor "g" of "a" and "b" is the unique (positive) common divisor of "a" and "b" that is divisible by any other common divisor "c".

The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a rectangular area "a" by "b", and any common divisor "c" that divides both "a" and "b" exactly. The sides of the rectangle can be divided into segments of length "c", which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length "c". The greatest common divisor "g" is the largest value of "c" for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12 = 2) and five squares along the other (60/12 = 5).

The GCD of two numbers "a" and "b" is the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used multiple times, but only as long as the product of these factors divides both "a" and "b". For example, since 1386 can be factored into 2 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 11, and 3213 can be factored into 3 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 17, the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals 63 = 3 × 3 × 7, the product of their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common divisor is 1 (obtained here as an instance of the <a href="empty%20product">empty product</a>), in other words they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors. <a href="integer%20factorization">Factorization</a> of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used <a href="cryptographic%20protocol">cryptographic protocol</a>s is based upon its infeasibility.

Another definition of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly <a href="ring%20theory">ring theory</a>. The greatest common divisor "g"  of two nonzero numbers "a" and "b" is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form "ua" + "vb" where "u" and "v" are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of "a" and "b" is actually the same as the set of all multiples of "g" ("mg", where "m" is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideal</a> generated by "a" and "b" is the ideal generated by "g" alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a <a href="principal%20ideal">principal ideal</a>, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of "a" and "b" also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of "ua" + "vb"). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.

The GCD of three or more numbers equals the product of the prime factors common to all the numbers, but it can also be calculated by repeatedly taking the GCDs of pairs of numbers. For example,

Thus, Euclid's algorithm, which computes the GCD of two integers, suffices to calculate the GCD of arbitrarily many integers.

The Euclidean algorithm proceeds in a series of steps such that the output of each step is used as an input for the next one. Let "k" be an integer that counts the steps of the algorithm, starting with zero. Thus, the initial step corresponds to "k" = 0, the next step corresponds to "k" = 1, and so on.

Each step begins with two nonnegative remainders "r" and "r". Since the algorithm ensures that the remainders decrease steadily with every step, "r" is less than its predecessor "r". The goal of the "k"th step is to find a <a href="quotient">quotient</a> "q" and <a href="remainder">remainder</a> "r" that satisfy the equation

and that have "r" < "r". In other words, multiples of the smaller number "r" are subtracted from the larger number "r" until the remainder "r" is smaller than "r".

In the initial step ("k" = 0), the remainders "r" and "r" equal "a" and "b", the numbers for which the GCD is sought. In the next step ("k" = 1), the remainders equal "b" and the remainder "r" of the initial step, and so on. Thus, the algorithm can be written as a sequence of equations

If "a" is smaller than "b", the first step of the algorithm swaps the numbers. For example, if "a" < "b", the initial quotient "q" equals zero, and the remainder "r" is "a". Thus, "r" is smaller than its predecessor "r" for all "k" ≥ 0.

Since the remainders decrease with every step but can never be negative, a remainder "r" must eventually equal zero, at which point the algorithm stops. The final nonzero remainder "r" is the greatest common divisor of "a" and "b". The number "N" cannot be infinite because there are only a finite number of nonnegative integers between the initial remainder "r" and zero.

The validity of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument. In the first step, the final nonzero remainder "r" is shown to divide both "a" and "b". Since it is a common divisor, it must be less than or equal to the greatest common divisor "g". In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of "a" and "b", including "g", must divide "r"; therefore, "g" must be less than or equal to "r". These two conclusions are inconsistent unless "r" = "g".

To demonstrate that "r" divides both "a" and "b" (the first step), "r" divides its predecessor "r"

since the final remainder "r" is zero. "r" also divides its next predecessor "r"

because it divides both terms on the right-hand side of the equation. Iterating the same argument, "r" divides all the preceding remainders, including "a" and "b". None of the preceding remainders "r", "r", etc. divide "a" and "b", since they leave a remainder. Since "r" is a common divisor of "a" and "b", "r" ≤ "g".

In the second step, any natural number "c" that divides both "a" and "b" (in other words, any common divisor of "a" and "b") divides the remainders "r". By definition, "a" and "b" can be written as multiples of "c" : "a" = "mc" and "b" = "nc", where "m" and "n" are natural numbers. Therefore, "c" divides the initial remainder "r", since "r" = "a" − "q""b" = "mc" − "q""nc" = ("m" − "q""n")"c". An analogous argument shows that "c" also divides the subsequent remainders "r", "r", etc. Therefore, the greatest common divisor "g" must divide "r", which implies that "g" ≤ "r". Since the first part of the argument showed the reverse ("r" ≤ "g"), it follows that "g" = "r". Thus, "g" is the greatest common divisor of all the succeeding pairs:

For illustration, the Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor of "a" = 1071 and "b" = 462. To begin, multiples of 462 are subtracted from 1071 until the remainder is less than 462. Two such multiples can be subtracted ("q" = 2), leaving a remainder of 147:

Then multiples of 147 are subtracted from 462 until the remainder is less than 147. Three multiples can be subtracted ("q" = 3), leaving a remainder of 21:

Then multiples of 21 are subtracted from 147 until the remainder is less than 21. Seven multiples can be subtracted ("q" = 7), leaving no remainder:

Since the last remainder is zero, the algorithm ends with 21 as the greatest common divisor of 1071 and 462. This agrees with the gcd(1071, 462) found by prime factorization <a href="%23Background">above</a>. In tabular form, the steps are

The Euclidean algorithm can be visualized in terms of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor. Assume that we wish to cover an "a"-by-"b" rectangle with square tiles exactly, where "a" is the larger of the two numbers. We first attempt to tile the rectangle using "b"-by-"b" square tiles; however, this leaves an "r"-by-"b" residual rectangle untiled, where "r" < "b". We then attempt to tile the residual rectangle with "r"-by-"r" square tiles. This leaves a second residual rectangle "r"-by-"r", which we attempt to tile using "r"-by-"r" square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle, i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle. For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 (shown in red), and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the dimensions of the original rectangle (shown in green).

At every step "k", the Euclidean algorithm computes a quotient "q" and remainder "r" from two numbers "r" and "r"

where the <a href="absolute%20value">magnitude</a> of "r" is strictly less than that of "r". The theorem which underlies the definition of the <a href="Euclidean%20division">Euclidean division</a> ensures that such a quotient and remainder always exist and are unique.

In Euclid's original version of the algorithm, the quotient and remainder are found by repeated subtraction; that is, "r" is subtracted from "r" repeatedly until the remainder "r" is smaller than "r". After that "r" and "r" are exchanged and the process is iterated. Euclidean division reduces all the steps between two exchanges into a single step, which is thus more efficient. Moreover, the quotients are not needed, thus one may replace Euclidean division by the <a href="modulo%20operation">modulo operation</a>, which gives only the remainder. Thus the iteration of the Euclidean algorithm becomes simply

Implementations of the algorithm may be expressed in <a href="pseudocode">pseudocode</a>. For example, the division-based version may be <a href="computer%20programming">programmed</a> as

At the beginning of the "k"th iteration, the variable "b" holds the latest remainder "r", whereas the variable "a" holds its predecessor, "r". The step "b" := "a" mod "b" is equivalent to the above recursion formula "r" ≡ "r" mod "r". The <a href="temporary%20variable">temporary variable</a> "t" holds the value of "r" while the next remainder "r" is being calculated. At the end of the loop iteration, the variable "b" holds the remainder "r", whereas the variable "a" holds its predecessor, "r".

In the subtraction-based version which was Euclid's original version, the remainder calculation ("b" = "a" mod "b") is replaced by repeated subtraction. Contrary to the division-based version, which works with arbitrary integers as input, the subtraction-based version supposes that the input consists of positive integers and stops when "a" = "b":

The variables "a" and "b" alternate holding the previous remainders "r" and "r". Assume that "a" is larger than "b" at the beginning of an iteration; then "a" equals "r", since "r" > "r". During the loop iteration, "a" is reduced by multiples of the previous remainder "b" until "a" is smaller than "b". Then "a" is the next remainder "r". Then "b" is reduced by multiples of "a" until it is again smaller than "a", giving the next remainder "r", and so on.

The recursive version is based on the equality of the GCDs of successive remainders and the stopping condition gcd("r", 0) = "r".

For illustration, the gcd(1071, 462) is calculated from the equivalent gcd(462, 1071 mod 462) = gcd(462, 147). The latter GCD is calculated from the gcd(147, 462 mod 147) = gcd(147, 21), which in turn is calculated from the gcd(21, 147 mod 21) = gcd(21, 0) = 21.

In another version of Euclid's algorithm, the quotient at each step is increased by one if the resulting negative remainder is smaller in magnitude than the typical positive remainder. Previously, the equation

assumed that . However, an alternative negative remainder can be computed:
if or
if .

If is replaced by when , then one gets a variant of Euclidean algorithm such that
at each step.

<a href="Leopold%20Kronecker">Leopold Kronecker</a> has shown that this version requires the least number of steps of any version of Euclid's algorithm. More generally, it has been proven that, for every input numbers "a" and "b", the number of steps is minimal if and only if is chosen in order that formula_3 where formula_4 is the <a href="golden%20ratio">golden ratio</a>.

The Euclidean algorithm is one of the oldest algorithms in common use. It appears in <a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">Euclid's "Elements"</a> (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the algorithm is formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for lengths of line segments. (In modern usage, one would say it was formulated there for <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths "a" and "b" corresponds to the greatest length "g" that measures "a" and "b" evenly; in other words, the lengths "a" and "b" are both integer multiples of the length "g".

The algorithm was probably not discovered by <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a>, who compiled results from earlier mathematicians in his "Elements". The mathematician and historian <a href="Bartel%20Leendert%20van%20der%20Waerden">B. L. van der Waerden</a> suggests that Book VII derives from a textbook on <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a> written by mathematicians in the school of <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>. The algorithm was probably known by <a href="Eudoxus%20of%20Cnidus">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a> (about 375 BC). The algorithm may even pre-date Eudoxus, judging from the use of the technical term ἀνθυφαίρεσις ("anthyphairesis", reciprocal subtraction) in works by Euclid and Aristotle.

Centuries later, Euclid's algorithm was discovered independently both in India and in China, primarily to solve <a href="Diophantine%20equation">Diophantine equation</a>s that arose in astronomy and making accurate calendars. In the late 5th century, the Indian mathematician and astronomer <a href="Aryabhata">Aryabhata</a> described the algorithm as the "pulverizer", perhaps because of its effectiveness in solving Diophantine equations. Although a special case of the <a href="Chinese%20remainder%20theorem">Chinese remainder theorem</a> had already been described in the Chinese book "<a href="Sunzi%20Suanjing">Sunzi Suanjing</a>", the general solution was published by <a href="Qin%20Jiushao">Qin Jiushao</a> in his 1247 book "Shushu Jiuzhang" (數書九章 "<a href="Mathematical%20Treatise%20in%20Nine%20Sections">Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections</a>"). The Euclidean algorithm was first described in Europe in the second edition of <a href="Claude%20Gaspard%20Bachet%20de%20M%C3%A9ziriac">Bachet's</a> "Problèmes plaisants et délectables" ("Pleasant and enjoyable problems", 1624). In Europe, it was likewise used to solve Diophantine equations and in developing <a href="continued%20fraction">continued fraction</a>s. The <a href="extended%20Euclidean%20algorithm">extended Euclidean algorithm</a> was published by the English mathematician <a href="Nicholas%20Saunderson">Nicholas Saunderson</a>, who attributed it to <a href="Roger%20Cotes">Roger Cotes</a> as a method for computing continued fractions efficiently.

In the 19th century, the Euclidean algorithm led to the development of new number systems, such as <a href="Gaussian%20integer">Gaussian integer</a>s and <a href="Eisenstein%20integer">Eisenstein integer</a>s. In 1815, <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Carl Gauss</a> used the Euclidean algorithm to demonstrate unique factorization of <a href="Gaussian%20integer">Gaussian integer</a>s, although his work was first published in 1832. Gauss mentioned the algorithm in his "<a href="Disquisitiones%20Arithmeticae">Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</a>" (published 1801), but only as a method for <a href="continued%20fraction">continued fraction</a>s. <a href="Peter%20Gustav%20Lejeune%20Dirichlet">Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet</a> seems to have been the first to describe the Euclidean algorithm as the basis for much of number theory. Lejeune Dirichlet noted that many results of number theory, such as unique factorization, would hold true for any other system of numbers to which the Euclidean algorithm could be applied. Lejeune Dirichlet's lectures on number theory were edited and extended by <a href="Richard%20Dedekind">Richard Dedekind</a>, who used Euclid's algorithm to study <a href="algebraic%20integer">algebraic integer</a>s, a new general type of number. For example, Dedekind was the first to prove <a href="Fermat%27s%20theorem%20on%20sums%20of%20two%20squares">Fermat's two-square theorem</a> using the unique factorization of Gaussian integers. Dedekind also defined the concept of a <a href="Euclidean%20domain">Euclidean domain</a>, a number system in which a generalized version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined (as described <a href="%23Euclidean%20domains">below</a>). In the closing decades of the 19th century, the Euclidean algorithm gradually became eclipsed by Dedekind's more general theory of <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideals</a>.

Other applications of Euclid's algorithm were developed in the 19th century. In 1829, <a href="Jacques%20Charles%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Sturm">Charles Sturm</a> showed that the algorithm was useful in the <a href="Sturm%27s%20theorem">Sturm chain</a> method for counting the real roots of polynomials in any given interval.

The Euclidean algorithm was the first <a href="integer%20relation%20algorithm">integer relation algorithm</a>, which is a method for finding integer relations between commensurate real numbers. Several novel <a href="integer%20relation%20algorithm">integer relation algorithm</a>s have been developed, such as the algorithm of <a href="Helaman%20Ferguson">Helaman Ferguson</a> and R.W. Forcade (1979) and the <a href="Lenstra%E2%80%93Lenstra%E2%80%93Lov%C3%A1sz%20lattice%20basis%20reduction%20algorithm">LLL algorithm</a>.

In 1969, Cole and Davie developed a two-player game based on the Euclidean algorithm, called "The Game of Euclid", which has an optimal strategy. The players begin with two piles of "a" and "b" stones. The players take turns removing "m" multiples of the smaller pile from the larger. Thus, if the two piles consist of "x" and "y" stones, where "x" is larger than "y", the next player can reduce the larger pile from "x" stones to "x" − "my" stones, as long as the latter is a nonnegative integer. The winner is the first player to reduce one pile to zero stones.

<a href="B%C3%A9zout%27s%20identity">Bézout's identity</a> states that the greatest common divisor "g" of two integers "a" and "b" can be represented as a linear sum of the original two numbers "a" and "b". In other words, it is always possible to find integers "s" and "t" such that "g" = "sa" + "tb".

The integers "s" and "t" can be calculated from the quotients "q", "q", etc. by reversing the order of equations in Euclid's algorithm. Beginning with the next-to-last equation, "g" can be expressed in terms of the quotient "q" and the two preceding remainders, "r" and "r":

Those two remainders can be likewise expressed in terms of their quotients and preceding remainders,

Substituting these formulae for "r" and "r" into the first equation yields "g" as a linear sum of the remainders "r" and "r". The process of substituting remainders by formulae involving their predecessors can be continued until the original numbers "a" and "b" are reached:

After all the remainders "r", "r", etc. have been substituted, the final equation expresses "g" as a linear sum of "a" and "b": "g" = "sa" + "tb". <a href="B%C3%A9zout%27s%20identity">Bézout's identity</a>, and therefore the previous algorithm, can both be generalized to the context of <a href="Euclidean%20domain">Euclidean domain</a>s.

Bézout's identity provides yet another definition of the greatest common divisor "g" of two numbers "a" and "b". Consider the set of all numbers "ua" + "vb", where "u" and "v" are any two integers. Since "a" and "b" are both divisible by "g", every number in the set is divisible by "g". In other words, every number of the set is an integer multiple of "g". This is true for every common divisor of "a" and "b". However, unlike other common divisors, the greatest common divisor is a member of the set; by Bézout's identity, choosing "u" = "s" and "v" = "t" gives "g". A smaller common divisor cannot be a member of the set, since every member of the set must be divisible by "g". Conversely, any multiple "m" of "g" can be obtained by choosing "u" = "ms" and "v" = "mt", where "s" and "t" are the integers of Bézout's identity. This may be seen by multiplying Bézout's identity by "m",

Therefore, the set of all numbers "ua" + "vb" is equivalent to the set of multiples "m" of "g". In other words, the set of all possible sums of integer multiples of two numbers ("a" and "b") is equivalent to the set of multiples of gcd("a", "b"). The GCD is said to be the generator of the <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideal</a> of "a" and "b". This GCD definition led to the modern <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>ic concepts of a <a href="principal%20ideal">principal ideal</a> (an ideal generated by a single element) and a <a href="principal%20ideal%20domain">principal ideal domain</a> (a <a href="domain%20%28ring%20theory%29">domain</a> in which every ideal is a principal ideal).

Certain problems can be solved using this result. For example, consider two measuring cups of volume "a" and "b". By adding/subtracting "u" multiples of the first cup and "v" multiples of the second cup, any volume "ua" + "vb" can be measured out. These volumes are all multiples of "g" = gcd("a", "b").

The integers "s" and "t" of Bézout's identity can be computed efficiently using the <a href="extended%20Euclidean%20algorithm">extended Euclidean algorithm</a>. This extension adds two recursive equations to Euclid's algorithm

with the starting values

Using this recursion, Bézout's integers "s" and "t" are given by "s" = "s" and "t" = "t", where "N+1" is the step on which the algorithm terminates with "r" = 0.

The validity of this approach can be shown by induction. Assume that the recursion formula is correct up to step "k" − 1 of the algorithm; in other words, assume that

for all "j" less than "k". The "k"th step of the algorithm gives the equation

Since the recursion formula has been assumed to be correct for "r" and "r", they may be expressed in terms of the corresponding "s" and "t" variables

Rearranging this equation yields the recursion formula for step "k", as required

The integers "s" and "t" can also be found using an equivalent <a href="matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrix</a> method. The sequence of equations of Euclid's algorithm

can be written as a product of 2-by-2 quotient matrices multiplying a two-dimensional remainder vector

Let M represent the product of all the quotient matrices

This simplifies the Euclidean algorithm to the form

To express "g" as a linear sum of "a" and "b", both sides of this equation can be multiplied by the <a href="invertible%20matrix">inverse</a> of the matrix M. The <a href="determinant">determinant</a> of M equals (−1), since it equals the product of the determinants of the quotient matrices, each of which is negative one. Since the determinant of M is never zero, the vector of the final remainders can be solved using the inverse of M

Since the top equation gives

the two integers of Bézout's identity are "s" = (−1)"m" and "t" = (−1)"m". The matrix method is as efficient as the equivalent recursion, with two multiplications and two additions per step of the Euclidean algorithm.

Bézout's identity is essential to many applications of Euclid's algorithm, such as demonstrating the <a href="Fundamental%20theorem%20of%20arithmetic">unique factorization</a> of numbers into prime factors. To illustrate this, suppose that a number "L" can be written as a product of two factors "u" and "v", that is, "L" = "uv". If another number "w" also divides "L" but is coprime with "u", then "w" must divide "v", by the following argument: If the greatest common divisor of "u" and "w" is 1, then integers "s" and "t" can be found such that

by Bézout's identity. Multiplying both sides by "v" gives the relation

Since "w" divides both terms on the right-hand side, it must also divide the left-hand side, "v". This result is known as <a href="Euclid%27s%20lemma">Euclid's lemma</a>. Specifically, if a prime number divides "L", then it must divide at least one factor of "L". Conversely, if a number "w" is coprime to each of a series of numbers "a", "a", ..., "a", then "w" is also coprime to their product, "a" × "a" × ... × "a".

Euclid's lemma suffices to prove that every number has a unique factorization into prime numbers. To see this, assume the contrary, that there are two independent factorizations of "L" into "m" and "n" prime factors, respectively

Since each prime "p" divides "L" by assumption, it must also divide one of the "q" factors; since each "q" is prime as well, it must be that "p" = "q". Iteratively dividing by the "p" factors shows that each "p" has an equal counterpart "q"; the two prime factorizations are identical except for their order. The unique factorization of numbers into primes has many applications in mathematical proofs, as shown below.

<a href="Diophantine%20equation">Diophantine equation</a>s are equations in which the solutions are restricted to integers; they are named after the 3rd-century Alexandrian mathematician <a href="Diophantus">Diophantus</a>. A typical "linear" Diophantine equation seeks integers "x" and "y" such that

where "a", "b" and "c" are given integers. This can be written as an equation for "x" in <a href="modular%20arithmetic">modular arithmetic</a>:

Let "g" be the greatest common divisor of "a" and "b". Both terms in "ax" + "by" are divisible by "g"; therefore, "c" must also be divisible by "g", or the equation has no solutions. By dividing both sides by "c"/"g", the equation can be reduced to Bezout's identity

where "s" and "t" can be found by the <a href="extended%20Euclidean%20algorithm">extended Euclidean algorithm</a>. This provides one solution to the Diophantine equation, "x" = "s" ("c"/"g") and "y" = "t" ("c"/"g").

In general, a linear Diophantine equation has no solutions, or an infinite number of solutions. To find the latter, consider two solutions, ("x", "y") and ("x", "y"), where

or equivalently

Therefore, the smallest difference between two "x" solutions is "b"/"g", whereas the smallest difference between two "y" solutions is "a"/"g". Thus, the solutions may be expressed as

By allowing "u" to vary over all possible integers, an infinite family of solutions can be generated from a single solution ("x", "y"). If the solutions are required to be "positive" integers ("x" > 0, "y" > 0), only a finite number of solutions may be possible. This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions; this is impossible for a <a href="system%20of%20linear%20equations">system of linear equations</a> when the solutions can be any <a href="real%20number">real number</a> (see <a href="Underdetermined%20system">Underdetermined system</a>).

A <a href="finite%20field">finite field</a> is a set of numbers with four generalized operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as <a href="commutativity">commutativity</a>, <a href="associativity">associativity</a> and <a href="distributivity">distributivity</a>. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0, 1, 2, ..., 12} using <a href="modular%20arithmetic">modular arithmetic</a>. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced <a href="modulo%20operation">modulo</a> 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5 × 7 = 35 mod 13 = 9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime "p"; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power "m" of a prime "p". Finite fields are often called <a href="%C3%89variste%20Galois">Galois</a> fields, and are abbreviated as GF("p") or GF("p").

In such a field with "m" numbers, every nonzero element "a" has a unique <a href="modular%20multiplicative%20inverse">modular multiplicative inverse</a>, "a" such that This inverse can be found by solving the congruence equation "ax" ≡ 1 mod "m", or the equivalent linear Diophantine equation

This equation can be solved by the Euclidean algorithm, as described <a href="%23Linear%20Diophantine%20equations">above</a>. Finding multiplicative inverses is an essential step in the <a href="RSA%20algorithm">RSA algorithm</a>, which is widely used in <a href="electronic%20commerce">electronic commerce</a>; specifically, the equation determines the integer used to decrypt the message. Note that although the RSA algorithm uses <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">rings</a> rather than fields, the Euclidean algorithm can still be used to find a multiplicative inverse where one exists. The Euclidean algorithm also has other applications in <a href="error-correcting%20code">error-correcting code</a>s; for example, it can be used as an alternative to the <a href="Berlekamp%E2%80%93Massey%20algorithm">Berlekamp–Massey algorithm</a> for decoding <a href="BCH%20code">BCH</a> and <a href="Reed%E2%80%93Solomon%20code">Reed–Solomon code</a>s, which are based on Galois fields.

Euclid's algorithm can also be used to solve multiple linear Diophantine equations. Such equations arise in the <a href="Chinese%20remainder%20theorem">Chinese remainder theorem</a>, which describes a novel method to represent an integer "x". Instead of representing an integer by its digits, it may be represented by its remainders "x" modulo a set of "N" coprime numbers "m":

The goal is to determine "x" from its "N" remainders "x". The solution is to combine the multiple equations into a single linear Diophantine equation with a much larger modulus "M" that is the product of all the individual moduli "m", and define "M" as

Thus, each "M" is the product of all the moduli "except" "m". The solution depends on finding "N" new numbers "h" such that

With these numbers "h", any integer "x" can be reconstructed from its remainders "x" by the equation

Since these numbers "h" are the multiplicative inverses of the "M", they may be found using Euclid's algorithm as described in the previous subsection.

The Euclidean algorithm can be used to arrange the set of all positive <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s into an infinite <a href="binary%20search%20tree">binary search tree</a>, called the <a href="Stern%E2%80%93Brocot%20tree">Stern–Brocot tree</a>.
The number 1 (expressed as a fraction 1/1) is placed at the root of the tree, and the location of any other number "a"/"b" can be found by computing gcd("a","b") using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its right child, and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether "a"/"b" is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number "a"/"b". This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree.

For example, 3/4 can be found by starting at the root, going to the left once, then to the right twice:

The Euclidean algorithm has almost the same relationship to another binary tree on the rational numbers called the <a href="Calkin%E2%80%93Wilf%20tree">Calkin–Wilf tree</a>. The difference is that the path is reversed: instead of producing a path from the root of the tree to a target, it produces a path from the target to the root.

The Euclidean algorithm has a close relationship with <a href="continued%20fraction">continued fraction</a>s. The sequence of equations can be written in the form

The last term on the right-hand side always equals the inverse of the left-hand side of the next equation. Thus, the first two equations may be combined to form

The third equation may be used to substitute the denominator term "r"/"r", yielding

The final ratio of remainders "r"/"r" can always be replaced using the next equation in the series, up to the final equation. The result is a continued fraction

In the worked example <a href="%23Worked%20example">above</a>, the gcd(1071, 462) was calculated, and the quotients "q" were 2, 3 and 7, respectively. Therefore, the fraction 1071/462 may be written

as can be confirmed by calculation.

Calculating a greatest common divisor is an essential step in several <a href="integer%20factorization">integer factorization</a> algorithms, such as <a href="Pollard%27s%20rho%20algorithm">Pollard's rho algorithm</a>, <a href="Shor%27s%20algorithm">Shor's algorithm</a>, <a href="Dixon%27s%20factorization%20method">Dixon's factorization method</a> and the <a href="Lenstra%20elliptic%20curve%20factorization">Lenstra elliptic curve factorization</a>. The Euclidean algorithm may be used to find this GCD efficiently. <a href="Continued%20fraction%20factorization">Continued fraction factorization</a> uses continued fractions, which are determined using Euclid's algorithm.

The computational efficiency of Euclid's algorithm has been studied thoroughly. This efficiency can be described by the number of division steps the algorithm requires, multiplied by the computational expense of each step. The first known analysis of Euclid's algorithm is due to A. A. L. Reynaud in 1811, who showed that the number of division steps on input ("u", "v") is bounded by "v"; later he improved this to "v"/2  + 2. Later, in 1841, <a href="Pierre%20Joseph%20%C3%89tienne%20Finck">P. J. E. Finck</a> showed that the number of division steps is at most 2 log "v" + 1, and hence Euclid's algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the input. <a href="%C3%89mile%20L%C3%A9ger">Émile Léger</a>, in 1837, studied the worst case, which is when the inputs are consecutive <a href="Fibonacci%20numbers">Fibonacci numbers</a>. Finck's analysis was refined by <a href="Gabriel%20Lam%C3%A9">Gabriel Lamé</a> in 1844, who showed that the number of steps required for completion is never more than five times the number "h" of base-10 digits of the smaller number "b".

In the <a href="uniform%20cost%20model">uniform cost model</a> (suitable for analyzing the complexity of gcd calculation on numbers that fit into a single machine word), each step of the algorithm takes <a href="constant%20time">constant time</a>, and Lamé's analysis implies that the total running time is also "O"("h"). However, in a model of computation suitable for computation with larger numbers, the computational expense of a single remainder computation in the algorithm can be as large as "O"("h"). In this case the total time for all of the steps of the algorithm can be analyzed using a <a href="telescoping%20series">telescoping series</a>, showing that it is also "O"("h"). Modern algorithmic techniques based on the <a href="Sch%C3%B6nhage%E2%80%93Strassen%20algorithm">Schönhage–Strassen algorithm</a> for fast integer multiplication can be used to speed this up, leading to <a href="quasilinear%20time">quasilinear algorithms</a> for the GCD.

The number of steps to calculate the GCD of two natural numbers, "a" and "b", may be denoted by "T"("a", "b"). If "g" is the GCD of "a" and "b", then "a" = "mg" and "b" = "ng" for two coprime numbers "m" and "n". Then

as may be seen by dividing all the steps in the Euclidean algorithm by "g". By the same argument, the number of steps remains the same if "a" and "b" are multiplied by a common factor "w": "T"("a", "b") = "T"("wa", "wb"). Therefore, the number of steps "T" may vary dramatically between neighboring pairs of numbers, such as T("a", "b") and T("a", "b" + 1), depending on the size of the two GCDs.

The recursive nature of the Euclidean algorithm gives another equation

where "T"("x", 0) = 0 by assumption.

If the Euclidean algorithm requires "N" steps for a pair of natural numbers "a" > "b" > 0, the smallest values of "a" and "b" for which this is true are the <a href="Fibonacci%20number">Fibonacci number</a>s "F" and "F", respectively. More precisely, if the Euclidean algorithm requires "N" steps for the pair "a" > "b", then one has "a" ≥ "F" and "b" ≥ "F". This can be shown by <a href="mathematical%20induction">induction</a>. If "N" = 1, "b" divides "a" with no remainder; the smallest natural numbers for which this is true is "b" = 1 and "a" = 2, which are "F" and "F", respectively. Now assume that the result holds for all values of "N" up to "M" − 1. The first step of the "M"-step algorithm is "a" = "q""b" + "r", and the Euclidean algorithm requires "M" − 1 steps for the pair "b" > "r". By induction hypothesis, one has "b" ≥ "F" and "r" ≥ "F". Therefore, "a" = "q""b" + "r" ≥ "b" + "r" ≥ "F" + "F" = "F",
which is the desired inequality.
This proof, published by <a href="Gabriel%20Lam%C3%A9">Gabriel Lamé</a> in 1844, represents the beginning of <a href="computational%20complexity%20theory">computational complexity theory</a>, and also the first practical application of the Fibonacci numbers.

This result suffices to show that the number of steps in Euclid's algorithm can never be more than five times the number of its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires "N" steps, then "b" is greater than or equal to "F" which in turn is greater than or equal to "φ", where "φ" is the <a href="golden%20ratio">golden ratio</a>. Since "b" ≥ "φ", then "N" − 1 ≤ log"b". Since log"φ" > 1/5, ("N" − 1)/5 < log"φ" log"b" = log"b". Thus, "N" ≤ 5 log"b". Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than <a href="Big%20O%20notation">"O"("h")</a> divisions, where "h" is the number of digits in the smaller number "b".

The average number of steps taken by the Euclidean algorithm has been defined in three different ways. The first definition is the average time "T"("a") required to calculate the GCD of a given number "a" and a smaller natural number "b" chosen with equal probability from the integers 0 to "a" − 1

However, since "T"("a", "b") fluctuates dramatically with the GCD of the two numbers, the averaged function "T"("a") is likewise "noisy".

To reduce this noise, a second average "τ"("a") is taken over all numbers coprime with "a"

There are "φ"("a") coprime integers less than "a", where "φ" is <a href="Euler%27s%20totient%20function">Euler's totient function</a>. This tau average grows smoothly with "a"

with the residual error being of order "a", where "ε" is <a href="infinitesimal">infinitesimal</a>. The constant "C" ("Porter's Constant") in this formula equals

where "γ" is the <a href="Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni%20constant">Euler–Mascheroni constant</a> and ζ' is the <a href="derivative">derivative</a> of the <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function">Riemann zeta function</a>. The leading coefficient (12/π) ln 2 was determined by two independent methods.

Since the first average can be calculated from the tau average by summing over the divisors "d" of "a"

it can be approximated by the formula

where Λ("d") is the <a href="von%20Mangoldt%20function">Mangoldt function</a>.

A third average "Y"("n") is defined as the mean number of steps required when both "a" and "b" are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) from 1 to "n"

Substituting the approximate formula for "T"("a") into this equation yields an estimate for "Y"("n")

In each step "k" of the Euclidean algorithm, the quotient "q" and remainder "r" are computed for a given pair of integers "r" and "r"

The computational expense per step is associated chiefly with finding "q", since the remainder "r" can be calculated quickly from "r", "r", and "q"

The computational expense of dividing "h"-bit numbers scales as "O"("h"("ℓ"+1)), where "ℓ" is the length of the quotient.

For comparison, Euclid's original subtraction-based algorithm can be much slower. A single integer division is equivalent to the quotient "q" number of subtractions. If the ratio of "a" and "b" is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, it has been shown that the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given quotient "q" is approximately ln|"u"/("u" − 1)| where "u" = ("q" + 1). For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the <a href="binary%20GCD%20algorithm">binary version</a> of Euclid's algorithm.

Combining the estimated number of steps with the estimated computational expense per step shows that the Euclid's algorithm grows quadratically ("h") with the average number of digits "h" in the initial two numbers "a" and "b". Let "h", "h", ..., "h" represent the number of digits in the successive remainders "r", "r", ..., "r". Since the number of steps "N" grows linearly with "h", the running time is bounded by

Euclid's algorithm is widely used in practice, especially for small numbers, due to its simplicity. For comparison, the efficiency of alternatives to Euclid's algorithm may be determined.

One inefficient approach to finding the GCD of two natural numbers "a" and "b" is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number "b". The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with "b", or exponentially in the number of digits. Another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted <a href="%23Greatest%20common%20divisor">above</a>, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers "a" and "b". Present methods for <a href="integer%20factorization">prime factorization</a> are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.

The <a href="binary%20GCD%20algorithm">binary GCD algorithm</a> is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations by exploiting the <a href="binary%20numeral%20system">binary</a> representation used by computers. However, this alternative also scales like <a href="big-O%20notation">"O"("h"²)</a>. It is generally faster than the Euclidean algorithm on real computers, even though it scales in the same way. Additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers "a" and "b". The binary algorithm can be extended to other bases ("k"-ary algorithms), with up to fivefold increases in speed. <a href="Lehmer%27s%20GCD%20algorithm">Lehmer's GCD algorithm</a> uses the same general principle as the binary algorithm to speed up GCD computations in arbitrary bases.

A recursive approach for very large integers (with more than 25,000 digits) leads to <a href="quasilinear%20time">quasilinear</a> integer GCD algorithms, such as those of Schönhage, and Stehlé and Zimmermann. These algorithms exploit the 2×2 matrix form of the Euclidean algorithm given <a href="%23Matrix%20method">above</a>. These quasilinear methods generally scale as 

Although the Euclidean algorithm is used to find the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers (positive integers), it may be generalized to the real numbers, and to other mathematical objects, such as <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a>s, <a href="quadratic%20integer">quadratic integer</a>s and <a href="Hurwitz%20quaternion">Hurwitz quaternion</a>s. In the latter cases, the Euclidean algorithm is used to demonstrate the crucial property of unique factorization, i.e., that such numbers can be factored uniquely into <a href="irreducible%20element">irreducible element</a>s, the counterparts of prime numbers. Unique factorization is essential to many proofs of number theory.

Euclid's algorithm can be applied to <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s, as described by Euclid in Book 10 of his "<a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">Elements</a>". The goal of the algorithm is to identify a real number such that two given real numbers, and , are integer multiples of it: and , where and are <a href="integer">integer</a>s. This identification is equivalent to finding an <a href="integer%20relation%20algorithm">integer relation</a> among the real numbers and ; that is, it determines integers and such that . Euclid uses this algorithm to treat the question of <a href="Commensurability%20%28mathematics%29">incommensurable lengths</a>.

The real-number Euclidean algorithm differs from its integer counterpart in two respects. First, the remainders are real numbers, although the quotients are integers as before. Second, the algorithm is not guaranteed to end in a finite number of steps. If it does, the fraction is a rational number, i.e., the ratio of two integers

and can be written as a finite continued fraction . If the algorithm does not stop, the fraction is an <a href="irrational%20number">irrational number</a> and can be described by an infinite continued fraction . Examples of infinite continued fractions are the <a href="golden%20ratio">golden ratio</a> and the <a href="square%20root%20of%202">square root of two</a>, . The algorithm is unlikely to stop, since <a href="almost%20all">almost all</a> ratios of two real numbers are irrational.

An infinite continued fraction may be truncated at a step to yield an approximation to that improves as is increased. The approximation is described by <a href="Convergent%20%28continued%20fraction%29">convergents</a> ; the numerator and denominators are coprime and obey the <a href="recurrence%20relation">recurrence relation</a>

where and are the initial values of the recursion. The convergent is the best <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a> approximation to with denominator :

Polynomials in a single variable "x" can be added, multiplied and factored into <a href="irreducible%20polynomial">irreducible polynomial</a>s, which are the analogs of the prime numbers for integers. The greatest common divisor polynomial of two polynomials and is defined as the product of their shared irreducible polynomials, which can be identified using the Euclidean algorithm. The basic procedure is similar to that for integers. At each step , a quotient polynomial and a remainder polynomial are identified to satisfy the recursive equation

where and . The quotient polynomial is chosen so that the leading term of equals the leading term of ; this ensures that the degree of each remainder is smaller than the degree of its predecessor: . Since the degree is a nonnegative integer, and since it decreases with every step, the Euclidean algorithm concludes in a finite number of steps. The final nonzero remainder is the greatest common divisor of the original two polynomials, and .

For example, consider the following two quartic polynomials, which each factor into two quadratic polynomials

<a href="polynomial%20long%20division">Dividing</a> by yields a remainder . In the next step, is divided by yielding a remainder . Finally, dividing by yields a zero remainder, indicating that is the greatest common divisor polynomial of and , consistent with their factorization.

Many of the applications described above for integers carry over to polynomials. The Euclidean algorithm can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for polynomials; continued fractions of polynomials can also be defined.

The polynomial Euclidean algorithm has other applications, such as <a href="Sturm%20chain">Sturm chain</a>s, a method for counting the <a href="zero%20of%20a%20function">zeros of a polynomial</a> that lie inside a given <a href="Interval%20%28mathematics%29">real interval</a>. This in turn has applications in several areas, such as the <a href="Routh%E2%80%93Hurwitz%20stability%20criterion">Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion</a> in <a href="control%20theory">control theory</a>.

Finally, the coefficients of the polynomials need not be drawn from integers, real numbers or even the complex numbers. For example, the coefficients may be drawn from a general field, such as the finite fields described above. The corresponding conclusions about the Euclidean algorithm and its applications hold even for such polynomials.

The Gaussian integers are <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s of the form , where and are ordinary <a href="integer">integer</a>s and is the <a href="imaginary%20unit">square root of negative one</a>. By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm, Gaussian integers can be shown to be uniquely factorizable, by the argument <a href="%23B%C3%A9zout%27s%20identity">above</a>. This unique factorization is helpful in many applications, such as deriving all <a href="Pythagorean%20triple">Pythagorean triple</a>s or proving <a href="Fermat%27s%20theorem%20on%20sums%20of%20two%20squares">Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares</a>. In general, the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications, but not essential; for example, the theorems can often be proven by other arguments.

The Euclidean algorithm developed for two Gaussian integers and is nearly the same as that for ordinary integers, but differs in two respects. As before, the task at each step is to identify a quotient and a remainder such that

where , where , and where every remainder is strictly smaller than its predecessor: . The first difference is that the quotients and remainders are themselves Gaussian integers, and thus are <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s. The quotients are generally found by rounding the real and complex parts of the exact ratio (such as the complex number ) to the nearest integers. The second difference lies in the necessity of defining how one complex remainder can be "smaller" than another. To do this, a <a href="norm%20%28mathematics%29">norm function</a> is defined, which converts every Gaussian integer into an ordinary integer. After each step of the Euclidean algorithm, the norm of the remainder is smaller than the norm of the preceding remainder, . Since the norm is a nonnegative integer and decreases with every step, the Euclidean algorithm for Gaussian integers ends in a finite number of steps. The final nonzero remainder is , the Gaussian integer of largest norm that divides both and ; it is unique up to multiplication by a unit, or .

Many of the other applications of the Euclidean algorithm carry over to Gaussian integers. For example, it can be used to solve linear Diophantine equations and Chinese remainder problems for Gaussian integers; continued fractions of Gaussian integers can also be defined.

A set of elements under two <a href="binary%20operation">binary operation</a>s, denoted as addition and multiplication, is called a <a href="Euclidean%20domain">Euclidean domain</a> if it forms a <a href="commutative%20ring">commutative ring</a> and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two operations of such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the operations of a <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">mathematical group</a> or <a href="monoid">monoid</a>. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as <a href="commutative%20property">commutativity</a>, <a href="associative%20property">associativity</a> and <a href="distributive%20property">distributivity</a>.

The generalized Euclidean algorithm requires a "Euclidean function", i.e., a mapping from into the set of nonnegative integers such that, for any two nonzero elements and in , there exist and in such that and . An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers <a href="%23Gaussian%20integers">above</a>. The function can be the magnitude of the number or the <a href="degree%20of%20a%20polynomial">degree of a polynomial</a>. The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces "f" inexorably; hence, if can be reduced only a finite number of times, the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps. This principle relies on the natural <a href="well-order">well-order</a>ing of the non-negative integers; roughly speaking, this requires that every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a smallest member.

The <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a> applies to any Euclidean domain: Any number from a Euclidean domain can be factored uniquely into <a href="irreducible%20element">irreducible element</a>s. Any Euclidean domain is a <a href="unique%20factorization%20domain">unique factorization domain</a> (UFD), although the converse is not true. The Euclidean domains and the UFD's are subclasses of the <a href="GCD%20domain">GCD domain</a>s, domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists. In other words, a greatest common divisor may exist (for all pairs of elements in a domain), although it may not be possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm. A Euclidean domain is always a <a href="principal%20ideal%20domain">principal ideal domain</a> (PID), an <a href="integral%20domain">integral domain</a> in which every <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideal</a> is a <a href="principal%20ideal">principal ideal</a>. Again, the converse is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.

The unique factorization of Euclidean domains is useful in many applications. For example, the unique factorization of the Gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all <a href="Pythagorean%20triple">Pythagorean triple</a>s and in proving <a href="Fermat%27s%20theorem%20on%20sums%20of%20two%20squares">Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares</a>. Unique factorization was also a key element in an attempted proof of <a href="Fermat%27s%20Last%20Theorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> published in 1847 by Gabriel Lamé, the same mathematician who analyzed the efficiency of Euclid's algorithm, based on a suggestion of <a href="Joseph%20Liouville">Joseph Liouville</a>. Lamé's approach required the unique factorization of numbers of the form , where and are integers, and {2} .</math>

If the function corresponds to a <a href="field%20norm">norm</a> function, such as that used to order the Gaussian integers <a href="%23Gaussian%20integers">above</a>, then the domain is known as "<a href="Norm-Euclidean%20field">norm-Euclidean</a>". The norm-Euclidean rings of quadratic integers are exactly those where is one of the values −11, −7, −3, −2, −1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, or 73. The cases and yield the <a href="Gaussian%20integer">Gaussian integer</a>s and <a href="Eisenstein%20integer">Eisenstein integer</a>s, respectively.

If is allowed to be any Euclidean function, then the list of possible values of for which the domain is Euclidean is not yet known. The first example of a Euclidean domain that was not norm-Euclidean (with ) was published in 1994. In 1973, Weinberger proved that a quadratic integer ring with is Euclidean if, and only if, it is a <a href="principal%20ideal%20domain">principal ideal domain</a>, provided that the <a href="generalized%20Riemann%20hypothesis">generalized Riemann hypothesis</a> holds.

The Euclidean algorithm may be applied to noncommutative rings such as the set of <a href="Hurwitz%20quaternion">Hurwitz quaternion</a>s. Let and represent two elements from such a ring. They have a common right divisor if and for some choice of and in the ring. Similarly, they have a common left divisor if and for some choice of and in the ring. Since multiplication is not commutative, there are two versions of the Euclidean algorithm, one for right divisors and one for left divisors. Choosing the right divisors, the first step in finding the by the Euclidean algorithm can be written

where represents the quotient and the remainder. This equation shows that any common right divisor of and is likewise a common divisor of the remainder . The analogous equation for the left divisors would be

With either choice, the process is repeated as above until the greatest common right or left divisor is identified. As in the Euclidean domain, the "size" of the remainder must be strictly smaller than , and there must be only a finite number of possible sizes for , so that the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate.

Most of the results for the GCD carry over to noncommutative numbers. For example, <a href="B%C3%A9zout%27s%20identity">Bézout's identity</a> states that the right can be expressed as a linear combination of and . In other words, there are numbers and such that

The analogous identity for the left GCD is nearly the same:

Bézout's identity can be used to solve Diophantine equations. For instance, one of the standard proofs of <a href="Lagrange%27s%20four-square%20theorem">Lagrange's four-square theorem</a>, that every positive integer can be represented as a sum of four squares, is based on quaternion GCDs in this way.

Francium

Francium is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Fr and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 87. It used to be known as <a href="Mendeleev%27s%20predicted%20elements">eka</a>-<a href="caesium">caesium</a>. It is extremely <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a>; its most stable isotope, francium-223 (originally called <a href="actinium">actinium</a> K after the natural <a href="decay%20chain">decay chain</a> it appears in), has a half-life of only 22 minutes. It is the second-most <a href="electronegative">electropositive</a> element, behind only caesium, and is the <a href="Abundance%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">second rarest</a> naturally occurring element (after <a href="astatine">astatine</a>). The isotopes of francium decay quickly into <a href="astatine">astatine</a>, <a href="radium">radium</a>, and <a href="radon">radon</a>. The <a href="electronic%20structure%20">electronic structure </a> of a francium atom is [Rn] 7s, and so the element is classed as an <a href="alkali%20metal">alkali metal</a>.

Bulk francium has never been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, it is assumed that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable, since the extreme heat of decay caused by its short half-life would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.

Francium was discovered by <a href="Marguerite%20Perey">Marguerite Perey</a> in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis. Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in <a href="uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="thorium">thorium</a> ores, where the <a href="isotope">isotope</a> francium-223 continually forms and decays. As little as 20–30 g (one ounce) exists at any given time throughout the <a href="Earth%27s%20crust">Earth's crust</a>; the other isotopes (except for francium-221) are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.

Francium is one of the most unstable of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived isotope, francium-223, has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of only 22 minutes. The only comparable element is <a href="astatine">astatine</a>, whose most stable natural isotope, astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56 seconds, although synthetic astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1 hours. All isotopes of francium decay into astatine, <a href="radium">radium</a>, or <a href="radon">radon</a>. Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived isotope of each synthetic element up to and including element 105, <a href="dubnium">dubnium</a>.

Francium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties mostly resemble those of caesium. A heavy element with a single <a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a>, it has the highest <a href="equivalent%20weight">equivalent weight</a> of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a <a href="surface%20tension">surface tension</a> of 0.05092 <a href="newton%20%28unit%29">N</a>/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was calculated to be around 27 °C (80 °F, 300 K). The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and <a href="radioactivity">radioactivity</a>. The estimated boiling point of 677 °C (1250 °F, 950 K) is also uncertain.

<a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> estimated the <a href="electronegativity">electronegativity</a> of francium at 0.7 on the <a href="Pauling%20scale">Pauling scale</a>, the same as caesium; the value for caesium has since been refined to 0.79, but there are no experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium. Francium has a slightly higher <a href="ionization%20energy">ionization energy</a> than caesium, 392.811(4) kJ/mol as opposed to 375.7041(2) kJ/mol for caesium, as would be expected from <a href="Relativistic%20quantum%20chemistry">relativistic effects</a>, and this would imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two. Francium should also have a higher <a href="electron%20affinity">electron affinity</a> than caesium and the Fr ion should be more <a href="polarizability">polarizable</a> than the Cs ion. The CsFr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium <a href="superoxide">superoxide</a> (FrO) is expected to have a more <a href="covalent">covalent</a> character than its lighter <a href="congener%20%28chemistry%29">congeners</a>; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium–oxygen bonding.

Francium <a href="coprecipitation">coprecipitates</a> with several caesium <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a>, such as <a href="caesium%20perchlorate">caesium perchlorate</a>, which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of <a href="Lawrence%20E.%20Glendenin">Lawrence E. Glendenin</a> and <a href="C.%20M.%20Nelson">Nelson</a>. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the <a href="iodate">iodate</a>, the <a href="picrate">picrate</a>, the <a href="tartrate">tartrate</a> (also <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a> tartrate), the <a href="chloroplatinate">chloroplatinate</a>, and the <a href="silicotungstate">silicotungstate</a>. It also coprecipitates with <a href="silicotungstic%20acid">silicotungstic acid</a>, and with <a href="perchloric%20acid">perchloric acid</a>, without another alkali metal as a <a href="carrier%20%28chemistry%29">carrier</a>, which provides other methods of separation. Nearly all francium salts are <a href="solubility">water-soluble</a>.

There are 34 known isotopes of francium ranging in <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a> from 199 to 232. Francium has seven <a href="metastability">metastable</a> <a href="nuclear%20isomer">nuclear isomer</a>s. Francium-223 and francium-221 are the only isotopes that occur in nature, though the former is far more common.

Francium-223 is the most stable isotope, with a half-life of 21.8 minutes, and it is highly unlikely that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized. Francium-223 is the fifth product of the <a href="actinium">actinium</a> decay series as the daughter isotope of actinium-227. Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> (1.149 MeV <a href="decay%20energy">decay energy</a>), with a minor (0.006%) <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> path to astatine-219 (5.4 MeV decay energy).

Francium-221 has a half-life of 4.8 minutes. It is the ninth product of the <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a> decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium-225. Francium-221 then decays into astatine-217 by alpha decay (6.457 MeV decay energy).

The least stable <a href="ground%20state">ground state</a> isotope is francium-215, with a half-life of 0.12 μs: it undergoes a 9.54 MeV alpha decay to astatine-211. Its <a href="metastable%20isomer">metastable isomer</a>, francium-215m, is less stable still, with a half-life of only 3.5 ns.

Due to its instability and rarity, there are no commercial applications for francium. It has been used for research purposes in the fields of <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>
and of <a href="atom">atomic structure</a>. Its use as a potential diagnostic aid for various <a href="cancer">cancer</a>s has also been explored, but this application has been deemed impractical.

Francium's ability to be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its relatively simple <a href="atom">atomic structure</a>, has made it the subject of specialized <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a> experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding <a href="energy%20level">energy level</a>s and the <a href="coupling%20constant">coupling constant</a>s between <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a>s. Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum theory</a>.

As early as 1870, chemists thought that there should be an alkali metal beyond <a href="caesium">caesium</a>, with an atomic number of 87. It was then referred to by the provisional name "<a href="Mendeleev%27s%20predicted%20elements">eka-caesium</a>". Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made.

Soviet chemist <a href="D.%20K.%20Dobroserdov">D. K. Dobroserdov</a> was the first scientist to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity in a sample of <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, <a href="potassium-40">potassium-40</a>). He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element "russium" after his home country. Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a>, and he did not pursue the element further.

The following year, English chemists <a href="Gerald%20J.%20F.%20Druce">Gerald J. F. Druce</a> and <a href="Frederick%20H.%20Loring">Frederick H. Loring</a> analyzed <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> photographs of <a href="manganese%28II%29%20sulfate">manganese(II) sulfate</a>. They observed spectral lines which they presumed to be of eka-caesium. They announced their discovery of element 87 and proposed the name "alkalinium", as it would be the heaviest alkali metal.

In 1930, <a href="Fred%20Allison">Fred Allison</a> of the <a href="Alabama%20Polytechnic%20Institute">Alabama Polytechnic Institute</a> claimed to have discovered element 87 when analyzing <a href="pollucite">pollucite</a> and <a href="lepidolite">lepidolite</a> using his <a href="magneto-optic%20effect">magneto-optical</a> machine. Allison requested that it be named "virginium" after his home state of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, along with the symbols Vi and Vm. In 1934, H.G. MacPherson of <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a> disproved the effectiveness of Allison's device and the validity of his discovery.

In 1936, Romanian physicist <a href="Horia%20Hulubei">Horia Hulubei</a> and his French colleague <a href="Yvette%20Cauchois">Yvette Cauchois</a> also analyzed pollucite, this time using their high-resolution X-ray apparatus. They observed several weak emission lines, which they presumed to be those of element 87. Hulubei and Cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name "moldavium", along with the symbol Ml, after <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a>, the Romanian province where Hulubei was born. In 1937, Hulubei's work was criticized by American physicist <a href="F.%20H.%20Hirsh%20Jr.">F. H. Hirsh Jr.</a>, who rejected Hulubei's research methods. Hirsh was certain that eka-caesium would not be found in nature, and that Hulubei had instead observed <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> or <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a> X-ray lines. Hulubei insisted that his X-ray apparatus and methods were too accurate to make such a mistake. Because of this, <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Perrin">Jean Baptiste Perrin</a>, <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> winner and Hulubei's mentor, endorsed moldavium as the true eka-caesium over <a href="Marguerite%20Perey">Marguerite Perey</a>'s recently discovered francium. Perey took pains to be accurate and detailed in her criticism of Hulubei's work, and finally she was credited as the sole discoverer of element 87. All other previous purported discoveries of element 87 were ruled out due to francium's very limited half-life.

Eka-caesium was discovered in on 7 January 1939 by <a href="Marguerite%20Perey">Marguerite Perey</a> of the <a href="Curie%20Institute%20%28Paris%29">Curie Institute</a> in Paris, when she purified a sample of <a href="actinium">actinium</a>-227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 keV. Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one which was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being <a href="thorium">thorium</a>, radium, <a href="lead">lead</a>, bismuth, or <a href="thallium">thallium</a>. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, produced by the <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> of actinium-227. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure which she later revised to 1%.

Perey named the new isotope "actinium-K" (it is now referred to as francium-223) and in 1946, she proposed the name "catium" (Cm) for her newly discovered element, as she believed it to be the most <a href="electronegativity">electropositive</a> <a href="cation">cation</a> of the elements. <a href="Ir%C3%A8ne%20Joliot-Curie">Irène Joliot-Curie</a>, one of Perey's supervisors, opposed the name due to its connotation of "cat" rather than "cation"; furthermore, the symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to <a href="curium">curium</a>. Perey then suggested "francium", after France. This name was officially adopted by the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a> (IUPAC) in 1949, becoming the second element after <a href="gallium">gallium</a> to be named after France. It was assigned the symbol Fa, but this abbreviation was revised to the current Fr shortly thereafter. Francium was the last element discovered in nature, rather than synthesized, following <a href="hafnium">hafnium</a> and <a href="rhenium">rhenium</a>. Further research into francium's structure was carried out by, among others, <a href="Sylvain%20Lieberman">Sylvain Lieberman</a> and his team at <a href="CERN">CERN</a> in the 1970s and 1980s.

Fr is the result of the alpha decay of <a href="Isotopes%20of%20actinium">Ac</a> and can be found in trace amounts in <a href="uranium">uranium</a> <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s. In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1 × 10 uranium atoms. It is also calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29">Earth's crust</a> at any given time.

Francium can be synthesized by a <a href="nuclear%20fusion">fusion</a> reaction when a gold-197 target is bombarded with a beam of oxygen-18 atoms from a <a href="linear%20accelerator">linear accelerator</a> in a process originally developed at in the physics department at the <a href="State%20University%20of%20New%20York%20at%20Stony%20Brook">State University of New York at Stony Brook</a> in 1995. Depending on the energy of the oxygen beam, the reaction can yield francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211.

The francium atoms leave the gold target as ions, which are neutralized by collision with yttrium and then isolated in a <a href="Magneto-optic%20effect">magneto-optical trap</a> (MOT) in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Although the atoms only remain in the trap for about 30 seconds before escaping or undergoing nuclear decay, the process supplies a continual stream of fresh atoms. The result is a <a href="steady%20state">steady state</a> containing a fairly constant number of atoms for a much longer time. The original apparatus could trap up to a few thousand atoms, while a later improved design could trap over 300,000 at a time. Sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms provided the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. The research project using this production method relocated to <a href="TRIUMF">TRIUMF</a> in 2012, where over 10 francium atoms have been held at a time, including large amounts of Fr in addition to Fr and Fr.

Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, <a href="deuterium">deuterons</a>, or <a href="helium">helium</a> <a href="ion">ion</a>s.

Fr can also be isolated from samples of its parent Ac, the francium being milked via elution with NHCl–CrO from an actinium-containing cation exchanger and purified by passing the solution through a <a href="silicon%20dioxide">silicon dioxide</a> compound loaded with <a href="barium%20sulfate">barium sulfate</a>.

In 1996, the Stony Brook group trapped 3000 atoms in their MOT, which was enough for a video camera to capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce. Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.

Frédéric Chopin

Frédéric François Chopin (; ; ; 1 March 181017 October 1849) was a <a href="Poland">Polish</a> composer and <a href="virtuoso">virtuoso</a> pianist of the <a href="Romantic%20music">Romantic</a> era who wrote primarily for solo piano. He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose "poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation."

Chopin was born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin in the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Warsaw">Duchy of Warsaw</a> and grew up in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, which in 1815 became part of <a href="Congress%20Poland">Congress Poland</a>. A <a href="child%20prodigy">child prodigy</a>, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the <a href="November%20Uprising">November 1830 Uprising</a>. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter—in the last 18 years of his life—he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salon</a>. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries (including <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert Schumann</a>). In 1835, Chopin obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to <a href="Maria%20Wodzi%C5%84ska">Maria Wodzińska</a> from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin (known by her pen name, <a href="George%20Sand">George Sand</a>). A brief and unhappy visit to <a href="Majorca">Majorca</a> with Sand in 1838–39 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer <a href="Jane%20Stirling">Jane Stirling</a>, who also arranged for him to visit <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> in 1848. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of <a href="pericarditis">pericarditis</a> aggravated by <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>.

All of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two <a href="piano%20concerto">piano concerto</a>s, a few <a href="chamber%20music">chamber pieces</a>, and some 19 <a href="Polish%20songs%20%28Chopin%29">songs set to Polish lyrics</a>. His piano writing was technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument: his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of the <a href="ballade%20%28classical%20music%29%23Instrumental%20ballades">instrumental "ballade"</a>. His major piano works also include <a href="mazurka">mazurka</a>s, <a href="waltz">waltz</a>es, <a href="nocturne">nocturne</a>s, <a href="polonaise">polonaise</a>s, <a href="%C3%A9tude">étude</a>s, <a href="impromptu">impromptu</a>s, <a href="scherzo">scherzo</a>s, <a href="prelude%20%28music%29">preludes</a> and <a href="sonata">sonata</a>s, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>, the <a href="classical%20music">classical tradition</a> of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">J.S. Bach</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, and <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>, and the atmosphere of the Paris salons of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, <a href="harmony">harmony</a>, and <a href="musical%20form">musical form</a>, and his association of music with <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>, were influential throughout and after the late <a href="romanticism">Romantic</a> period.

Chopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his (indirect) association with political insurrection, his high-profile love-life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of <a href="%23In%20literature%2C%20stage%2C%20film%20and%20television">numerous films and biographies</a> of varying historical fidelity.

Fryderyk Chopin was born in <a href="%C5%BBelazowa%20Wola">Żelazowa Wola</a>, 46 kilometres () west of Warsaw, in what was then the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Warsaw">Duchy of Warsaw</a>, a Polish state established by <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>. The parish baptismal record gives his birthday as 22 February 1810, and cites his <a href="given%20name">given name</a>s in the Latin form "Fridericus Franciscus" (in Polish, he was "Fryderyk Franciszek"). However, the composer and his family used the birthdate 1 March, which is now generally accepted as the correct date.

In October 1810, six months after Fryderyk's birth, the family moved to Warsaw, where his father acquired a post teaching French at the <a href="Warsaw%20Lyceum">Warsaw Lyceum</a>, then housed in the <a href="Saxon%20Palace">Saxon Palace</a>. Fryderyk lived with his family in the Palace grounds. The father played the <a href="flute">flute</a> and violin; the mother played the piano and gave lessons to boys in the boarding house that the Chopins kept. Chopin was of slight build, and even in early childhood was prone to illnesses.

Fryderyk may have had some piano instruction from his mother, but his first professional music tutor, from 1816 to 1821, was the Czech pianist <a href="Wojciech%20%C5%BBywny">Wojciech Żywny</a>. His elder sister Ludwika also took lessons from Żywny, and occasionally played duets with her brother. It quickly became apparent that he was a <a href="child%20prodigy">child prodigy</a>. By the age of seven Fryderyk had begun giving public concerts, and in 1817 he composed two <a href="polonaise">polonaise</a>s, in <a href="G%20minor">G minor</a> and <a href="B-flat%20major">B-flat major</a>. His next work, a polonaise in A-flat major of 1821, dedicated to Żywny, is his earliest surviving musical manuscript.

In 1817 the Saxon Palace was requisitioned by Warsaw's Russian governor for military use, and the Warsaw Lyceum was reestablished in the <a href="Kazimierz%20Palace">Kazimierz Palace</a> (today the rectorate of <a href="Warsaw%20University">Warsaw University</a>). Fryderyk and his family moved to a building, which still survives, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. During this period, Fryderyk was sometimes invited to the <a href="Belweder">Belweder Palace</a> as playmate to the son of the ruler of <a href="Congress%20Poland">Russian Poland</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Constantine%20Pavlovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia</a>; he played the piano for Constantine Pavlovich and composed a march for him. <a href="Julian%20Ursyn%20Niemcewicz">Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz</a>, in his dramatic <a href="eclogue">eclogue</a>, ""Nasze Przebiegi"" ("Our Discourses", 1818), attested to "little Chopin's" popularity.

From September 1823 to 1826, Chopin attended the Warsaw Lyceum, where he received <a href="organ%20%28music%29">organ</a> lessons from the <a href="Czechs">Czech</a> musician <a href="Wilhelm%20W%C3%BCrfel">Wilhelm Würfel</a> during his first year. In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>n composer <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Elsner">Józef Elsner</a> at the <a href="Fryderyk%20Chopin%20University%20of%20Music">Warsaw Conservatory</a>, studying <a href="music%20theory">music theory</a>, <a href="figured%20bass">figured bass</a> and <a href="musical%20composition">composition</a>. Throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged by the inventors of the "aeolomelodicon" (a combination of piano and mechanical organ), and on this instrument in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by <a href="Ignaz%20Moscheles">Moscheles</a>. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a recital on a similar instrument (the "aeolopantaleon") before <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Tsar Alexander I</a>, who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent aeolopantaleon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his <a href="Rondo%20in%20C%20minor%20%28Chopin%29">Rondo Op. 1</a>. This was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press, when the Leipzig "<a href="Allgemeine%20musikalische%20Zeitung">Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung</a>" praised his "wealth of musical ideas".

During 1824–28 Chopin spent his vacations away from Warsaw, at a number of locales. In 1824 and 1825, at <a href="Szafarnia%2C%20Kuyavian-Pomeranian%20Voivodeship">Szafarnia</a>, he was a guest of <a href="Dominik%20Dziewanowski">Dominik Dziewanowski</a>, the father of a schoolmate. Here for the first time he encountered Polish rural <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>. His letters home from Szafarnia (to which he gave the title "The Szafarnia Courier"), written in a very modern and lively Polish, amused his family with their <a href="parody">spoofing</a> of the Warsaw newspapers and demonstrated the youngster's literary gift.

In 1827, soon after the death of Chopin's youngest sister Emilia, the family moved from the Warsaw University building, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace, to <a href="Chopin%20family%20parlor">lodgings just across the street from the university</a>, in the south annexe of the <a href="Czapski%20Palace%23History">Krasiński Palace</a> on <a href="Krakowskie%20Przedmie%C5%9Bcie">Krakowskie Przedmieście</a>, where Chopin lived until he left Warsaw in 1830. Here his parents continued running their boarding house for male students; the <a href="Chopin%20Family%20Parlor">Chopin Family Parlour</a> ("Salonik Chopinów") became a museum in the 20th century. In 1829 the artist <a href="Ambro%C5%BCy%20Mieroszewski">Ambroży Mieroszewski</a> executed a set of portraits of Chopin family members, including the first known portrait of the composer.

Four boarders at his parents' apartments became Chopin's intimates: <a href="Tytus%20Woyciechowski">Tytus Woyciechowski</a>, <a href="Jan%20Nepomucen%20Bia%C5%82ob%C5%82ocki">Jan Nepomucen Białobłocki</a>, <a href="Jan%20Matuszy%C5%84ski">Jan Matuszyński</a> and <a href="Julian%20Fontana">Julian Fontana</a>; the latter two would become part of his Paris milieu. He was friendly with members of Warsaw's young artistic and intellectual world, including Fontana, <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Bohdan%20Zaleski">Józef Bohdan Zaleski</a> and <a href="Stefan%20Witwicki">Stefan Witwicki</a>. He was also attracted to the singing student <a href="Konstancja%20G%C5%82adkowska">Konstancja Gładkowska</a>. In letters to Woyciechowski, he indicated which of his works, and even which of their passages, were influenced by his fascination with her; his letter of 15 May 1830 revealed that the slow movement ("Larghetto") of his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%201%20%28Chopin%29">Piano Concerto No. 1 (in E minor)</a> was secretly dedicated to her – "It should be like dreaming in beautiful springtime – by moonlight." His final Conservatory report (July 1829) read: "Chopin F., third-year student, exceptional talent, musical genius."

In September 1828 Chopin, while still a student, visited Berlin with a family friend, zoologist <a href="Feliks%20Pawe%C5%82%20Jarocki">Feliks Jarocki</a>, enjoying operas directed by <a href="Gaspare%20Spontini">Gaspare Spontini</a> and attending concerts by <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Zelter">Carl Friedrich Zelter</a>, <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a> and other celebrities. On an 1829 return trip to Berlin, he was a guest of Prince <a href="Antoni%20Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82">Antoni Radziwiłł</a>, governor of the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Posen">Grand Duchy of Posen</a>—himself an accomplished composer and aspiring cellist. For the prince and his pianist daughter Wanda, he composed his <a href="Introduction%20and%20Polonaise%20brillante%20%28Chopin%29">Introduction and Polonaise brillante in C major for cello and piano</a>, Op. 3.

Back in Warsaw that year, Chopin heard <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Paganini">Niccolò Paganini</a> play the violin, and composed a set of variations, "Souvenir de Paganini". It may have been this experience which encouraged him to commence writing his first <a href="%C3%89tudes%20%28Chopin%29">Études</a>, (1829–32), exploring the capacities of his own instrument. On 11 August, three weeks after completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory, he made his debut in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>. He gave two piano concerts and received many favourable reviews—in addition to some commenting (in Chopin's own words) that he was "too delicate for those accustomed to the piano-bashing of local artists". In one of these concerts, he premiered his <a href="Variations%20on%20%26quot%3BL%C3%A0%20ci%20darem%20la%20mano%26quot%3B%20%28Chopin%29">Variations on "Là ci darem la mano"</a>, Op. 2 (variations on a duet from <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>'s opera "<a href="Don%20Giovanni">Don Giovanni</a>") for piano and orchestra. He returned to Warsaw in September 1829, where he premiered his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Chopin%29">Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor</a>, Op. 21 on 17 March 1830.

Chopin's successes as a composer and performer opened the door to western Europe for him, and on 2 November 1830, he set out, in the words of <a href="Zdzis%C5%82aw%20Jachimecki">Zdzisław Jachimecki</a>, "into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever." With Woyciechowski, he headed for Austria again, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the <a href="November%20Uprising">November 1830 Uprising</a> broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, "I curse the moment of my departure." When in September 1831 he learned, while travelling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: "Oh God! ... You are there, and yet you do not take vengeance!" Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer's maturing "into an inspired <a href="national%20bard">national bard</a> who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland."

When he left Warsaw in late 1830, Chopin had intended to go to Italy, but violent unrest there made that a dangerous destination. His next choice was Paris; difficulties obtaining a visa from Russian authorities resulted in him getting a transit permission from the French. In later years he would quote the passport's endorsement "Passeport en passant par Paris à Londres" ("In transit to London via Paris"), joking that he was in the city "only in passing."

Chopin arrived in Paris in late September 1831; he would never return to Poland, thus becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish <a href="Great%20Emigration">Great Emigration</a>. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer <a href="Adam%20Zamoyski">Adam Zamoyski</a> writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.

In Paris, Chopin encountered artists and other distinguished figures, and found many opportunities to exercise his talents and achieve celebrity. During his years in Paris he was to become acquainted with, among many others, <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a>, <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, <a href="Ferdinand%20Hiller">Ferdinand Hiller</a>, <a href="Heinrich%20Heine">Heinrich Heine</a>, <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delacroix">Eugène Delacroix</a>, and <a href="Alfred%20de%20Vigny">Alfred de Vigny</a>. Chopin was also acquainted with the poet <a href="Adam%20Mickiewicz">Adam Mickiewicz</a>, principal of the Polish Literary Society, some of whose verses he set as songs.

Two Polish friends in Paris were also to play important roles in Chopin's life there. His fellow student at the Warsaw Conservatory, Julian Fontana, had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in England; Fontana was to become, in the words of Michałowski and Samson, Chopin's "general <a href="servant">factotum</a> and copyist". <a href="Wojciech%20Grzyma%C5%82a">Albert Grzymała</a>, who in Paris became a wealthy financier and society figure, often acted as Chopin's adviser and "gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [his] life."

At the end of 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert Schumann</a>, reviewing the Op. 2 Variations in the "Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung" (his first published article on music), declared: "Hats off, gentlemen! A genius." On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the <a href="Salle%20Pleyel">Salle Pleyel</a> which drew universal admiration. The critic <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Joseph%20F%C3%A9tis">François-Joseph Fétis</a> wrote in the "<a href="Revue%20et%20gazette%20musicale">Revue et gazette musicale</a>": "Here is a young man who ... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music, ... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else ..." After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy <a href="Rothschild%20family">Rothschild</a> banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private <a href="salon%20%28gathering%29">salons</a> (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe. This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.
Chopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons, but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends. The musicologist <a href="Arthur%20Hedley">Arthur Hedley</a> has observed that "As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances—few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime." The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts provides an indication of the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos) a <a href="Harpsichord%20concertos%20%28J.%20S.%20Bach%29%23Concertos%20for%20three%20harpsichords">concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards</a>; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil <a href="Adolphe%20Gutmann">Adolphe Gutmann</a>, <a href="Charles-Valentin%20Alkan">Charles-Valentin Alkan</a>, and Alkan's teacher <a href="Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume%20Zimmermann">Joseph Zimmermann</a> performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Beethoven%29">7th symphony</a>. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's "<a href="Hexameron%20%28musical%20composition%29">Hexameron</a>"; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on <a href="Vincenzo%20Bellini">Bellini</a>'s theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with <a href="Maurice%20Schlesinger">Maurice Schlesinger</a>, who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.

In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in <a href="Aachen">Aix-la-Chapelle</a> with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as "a very agreeable day", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Schadow">Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow</a>, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as <a href="Karl%20Friedrich%20Lessing">Lessing</a>, <a href="Eduard%20Bendemann">Bendemann</a>, <a href="Eduard%20Hildebrandt">Hildebrandt</a> and <a href="Karl%20Ferdinand%20Sohn">Sohn</a>. In 1835 Chopin went to <a href="Karlovy%20Vary">Carlsbad</a>, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter <a href="Maria%20Wodzi%C5%84ska">Maria</a> in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, <a href="Clara%20Schumann">Clara Wieck</a> and Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio "<a href="St.%20Paul%20%28oratorio%29">St. Paul</a>", and who considered him "a perfect musician". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to <a href="Marienbad">Marienbad</a> and <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> to be with the Wodziński family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzińska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his <a href="Ballades%20%28Chopin%29%23Ballade%20No.%201">G minor Ballade</a>. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 <a href="Nocturnes%2C%20Op.%2027%20%28Chopin%29%23Nocturne%20in%20C-sharp%20minor%2C%20Op.%2027%2C%20No.%201">Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1</a>. The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.

Although it is not known exactly when Chopin first met Liszt after arriving in Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski that "I have met <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Rossini</a>, <a href="Luigi%20Cherubini">Cherubini</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Baillot">Baillot</a>, etc.—also <a href="Friedrich%20Kalkbrenner">Kalkbrenner</a>. You would not believe how curious I was about <a href="Henri%20Herz">Herz</a>, Liszt, Hiller, etc." Liszt was in attendance at Chopin's Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at the Salle Pleyel, which led him to remark: "The most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art."

The two became friends, and for many years lived in close proximity in Paris, Chopin at 38 <a href="Rue%20de%20la%20Chauss%C3%A9e-d%27Antin">Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin</a>, and Liszt at the Hôtel de France on the Rue Lafitte, a few blocks away. They performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841. The first, on 2 April 1833, was at a benefit concert organized by Hector Berlioz for his bankrupt Shakespearean actress wife <a href="Harriet%20Smithson">Harriet Smithson</a>, during which they played <a href="George%20Onslow%20%28composer%29">George Onslow</a>'s "Sonata in F minor" for piano duet. Later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the Benevolent Association of Polish Ladies in Paris. Their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the <a href="Beethoven%20Monument%20%28Bonn%29">Beethoven Monument</a> in Bonn, held at the Salle Pleyel and the Paris Conservatory on 25 and 26 April 1841.

Although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship. <a href="Harold%20C.%20Schonberg">Harold C. Schonberg</a> believes that Chopin displayed a "tinge of jealousy and spite" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, "I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies." However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as "my friend Liszt". Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress <a href="Marie%20d%27Agoult">Marie d'Agoult</a>'s obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with <a href="George%20Sand">George Sand</a>.

In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author <a href="George%20Sand">George Sand</a> (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin). Short (under five feet, or 152 cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker, she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, "What an unattractive person "la Sand" is. Is she really a woman?" However, by early 1837 Maria Wodzińska's mother had made it clear to Chopin in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was unlikely to proceed. It is thought that she was influenced by his poor health and possibly also by rumours about his associations with women such as d'Agoult and Sand. Chopin finally placed the letters from Maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote, in Polish, "My tragedy". Sand, in a letter to Grzymała of June 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship with Chopin; she asked Grzymała to assess Chopin's relationship with Maria Wodzińska, without realising that the affair, at least from Maria's side, was over.

In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer <a href="Camille%20Pleyel">Camille Pleyel</a> where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker <a href="James%20Broadwood">James Broadwood</a>. On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest and by the end of June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: "I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me ... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away ..." The two spent a miserable winter on <a href="Majorca">Majorca</a> (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover <a href="F%C3%A9licien%20Mallefille">Félicien Mallefille</a>. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former <a href="Carthusian">Carthusian</a> monastery in <a href="Valldemossa">Valldemossa</a>, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.

On 3 December, Chopin complained about his bad health and the incompetence of the doctors in Majorca: "Three doctors have visited me ... The first said I was dead; the second said I was dying; and the third said I was about to die." He also had problems having his <a href="Pleyel%20et%20Cie">Pleyel piano</a> sent to him, having to rely in the meantime on a piano made in <a href="Palma%2C%20Majorca">Palma</a> by Juan Bauza. The Pleyel piano finally arrived from Paris in December, just shortly before Chopin and Sand left the island. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: "I am sending you my <a href="Preludes%20%28Chopin%29">Preludes</a> [(Op. 28)]. I finished them on your little piano, which arrived in the best possible condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the Palma customs." Chopin was also able to undertake work while in Majorca on his <a href="Ballades%20%28Chopin%29%23Ballade%20No.%202">Ballade No. 2</a>, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the <a href="Scherzo%20No.%203%20%28Chopin%29">Scherzo No. 3</a>, Op. 39.
Although this period had been productive, the bad weather had such a detrimental effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined to leave the island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts. The group traveled first to <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, then to <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a>, where they stayed for a few months while Chopin convalesced. In May 1839 they headed for the summer to Sand's estate at <a href="Nohant-Vic">Nohant</a>, where they spent most summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's rented accommodation at the rue Pigalle. He frequently visited Sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence. In 1842 he and Sand moved to the <a href="Square%20d%27Orl%C3%A9ans">Square d'Orléans</a>, living in adjacent buildings.

At the funeral of the tenor <a href="Adolphe%20Nourrit">Adolphe Nourrit</a> in Paris in 1839, Chopin made a rare appearance at the organ, playing a transcription of <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Franz Schubert</a>'s "<a href="lied">lied</a>" "Die Gestirne" (D. 444). On 26 July 1840 Chopin and Sand were present at the dress rehearsal of Berlioz's "<a href="Grande%20symphonie%20fun%C3%A8bre%20et%20triomphale">Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale</a>", composed to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a>. Chopin was reportedly unimpressed with the composition.

During the summers at Nohant, particularly in the years 1839–43, Chopin found quiet, productive days during which he composed many works, including his <a href="Polonaise%20in%20A-flat%20major%2C%20Op.%2053%20%28Chopin%29">Polonaise in A-flat major</a>, Op. 53. Among the visitors to Nohant were Delacroix and the <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> <a href="Pauline%20Viardot">Pauline Viardot</a>, whom Chopin had advised on piano technique and composition. Delacroix gives an account of staying at Nohant in a letter of 7 June 1842:
The hosts could not be more pleasant in entertaining me. When we are not all together at dinner, lunch, playing billiards, or walking, each of us stays in his room, reading or lounging around on a couch. Sometimes, through the window which opens on the garden, a gust of music wafts up from Chopin at work. All this mingles with the songs of nightingales and the fragrance of roses.

From 1842 onwards, Chopin showed signs of serious illness. After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzymała: "I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much." He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at Érard's on 1 March 1843. Late in 1844, <a href="Charles%20Hall%C3%A9">Charles Hallé</a> visited Chopin and found him "hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor. Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from <a href="temporal%20lobe%20epilepsy">temporal lobe epilepsy</a>.

Chopin's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange's fiancé, the young fortune-hunting sculptor <a href="Auguste%20Cl%C3%A9singer">Auguste Clésinger</a>. The composer frequently took Solange's side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand's son Maurice. Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand's radical political pursuits, while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain. As the composer's illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her "third child". In letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a "child," a "little angel", a "sufferer" and a "beloved little corpse." In 1847 Sand published her novel "Lucrezia Floriani", whose main characters—a rich actress and a prince in weak health—could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the <a href="galley%20proof">printer's galleys</a>. In 1847 he did not visit Nohant, and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which, in Sand's words, made "a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship." The two would never meet again.

Chopin's output as a composer throughout this period declined in quantity year by year. Whereas in 1841 he had written a dozen works, only six were written in 1842 and six shorter pieces in 1843. In 1844 he wrote only the <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20No.%203%20%28Chopin%29">Op. 58 sonata</a>. 1845 saw the completion of three mazurkas (Op. 59). Although these works were more refined than many of his earlier compositions, Zamoyski concludes that "his powers of concentration were failing and his inspiration was beset by anguish, both emotional and intellectual."

Chopin's public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane, as did the number of his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially. In February 1848, with the cellist <a href="Auguste%20Franchomme">Auguste Franchomme</a>, he gave his last Paris concert, which included three movements of the <a href="Cello%20Sonata%20%28Chopin%29">Cello Sonata Op. 65</a>.
In April, during the <a href="French%20Revolution%20of%201848">Revolution of 1848</a> in Paris, he left for London, where he performed at several concerts and at numerous receptions in great houses. This tour was suggested to him by his Scottish pupil <a href="Jane%20Stirling">Jane Stirling</a> and her elder sister. Stirling also made all the logistical arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding.

In London Chopin took lodgings at <a href="Dover%20Street">Dover Street</a>, where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at <a href="Stafford%20House">Stafford House</a>, the audience included <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">Thackeray</a> and the singer <a href="Jenny%20Lind">Jenny Lind</a>. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guinea</a> per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts. On 28 August, he played at a concert in Manchester's Concert Hall, sharing the stage with <a href="Marietta%20Alboni">Marietta Alboni</a> and <a href="Lorenzo%20Salvi">Lorenzo Salvi</a>.

In late summer he was invited by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he stayed at Calder House near <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and at <a href="Johnstone%20Castle">Johnstone Castle</a> in <a href="Renfrewshire">Renfrewshire</a>, both owned by members of Stirling's family. She clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged to make it clear to her that this could not be so. He wrote at this time to Grzymała "My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores", and responding to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was "closer to the grave than the nuptial bed." He gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September, and another in Edinburgh, at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4 October. In late October 1848, while staying at 10 Warriston Crescent in Edinburgh with the Polish physician Adam Łyszczyński, he wrote out his last will and testament—"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, if I should drop dead somewhere", he wrote to Grzymała.

Chopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform at London's <a href="Guildhall%2C%20London">Guildhall</a> on 16 November 1848, when, in a final patriotic gesture, he played for the benefit of Polish refugees. By this time he was very seriously ill, weighing under 99 pounds (i.e. less than 45 kg), and his doctors were aware that his sickness was at a terminal stage.

At the end of November, Chopin returned to Paris. He passed the winter in unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including Delacroix and Franchomme. Occasionally he played, or accompanied the singing of <a href="Delfina%20Potocka">Delfina Potocka</a>, for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in <a href="Chaillot">Chaillot</a>, out of the centre of the city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Obreskoff. Here in June 1849 he was visited by <a href="Jenny%20Lind">Jenny Lind</a>.

With his health further deteriorating, Chopin desired to have a family member with him. In June 1849 his sister Ludwika came to Paris with her husband and daughter, and in September, supported by a loan from Jane Stirling, he took an apartment at <a href="Place%20Vend%C3%B4me">Place Vendôme 12</a>. After 15 October, when his condition took a marked turn for the worse, only a handful of his closest friends remained with him, although Viardot remarked sardonically that "all the grand Parisian ladies considered it "<a href="de%20rigueur">de rigueur</a>" to faint in his room."

Some of his friends provided music at his request; among them, Potocka sang and Franchomme played the cello. Chopin bequeathed his unfinished notes on a piano tuition method, "Projet de méthode", to Alkan for completion. On 17 October, after midnight, the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly. "No longer", he replied. He died a few minutes before two o'clock in the morning. Those present at the deathbed appear to have included his sister Ludwika, Princess Marcelina Czartoryska, Sand's daughter Solange, and his close friend Thomas Albrecht. Later that morning, Solange's husband Clésinger made Chopin's <a href="death%20mask">death mask</a> and a cast of his left hand.

The funeral, held at the <a href="%C3%89glise%20de%20la%20Madeleine">Church of the Madeleine</a> in Paris, was delayed almost two weeks, until 30 October. Entrance was restricted to ticket holders as many people were expected to attend. Over 3,000 people arrived without invitations, from as far as London, Berlin and Vienna, and were excluded.

<a href="Requiem%20%28Mozart%29">Mozart's Requiem</a> was sung at the funeral; the soloists were the <a href="soprano">soprano</a> <a href="Jeanne-Ana%C3%AFs%20Castellan">Jeanne-Anaïs Castellan</a>, the <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> <a href="Pauline%20Viardot">Pauline Viardot</a>, the <a href="tenor">tenor</a> <a href="Alexis%20Dupont">Alexis Dupont</a>, and the <a href="bass%20%28voice%20type%29">bass</a> <a href="Luigi%20Lablache">Luigi Lablache</a>; Chopin's Preludes No. 4 in E minor and No. 6 in B minor were also played. The organist at the funeral was <a href="Louis%20James%20Alfred%20Lef%C3%A9bure-W%C3%A9ly">Louis Lefébure-Wély</a>. The funeral procession to <a href="P%C3%A8re%20Lachaise%20Cemetery">Père Lachaise Cemetery</a>, which included Chopin's sister Ludwika, was led by the aged Prince <a href="Adam%20Jerzy%20Czartoryski">Adam Czartoryski</a>. The pallbearers included Delacroix, Franchomme, and Camille Pleyel. At the graveside, the "Funeral March" from <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20No.%202%20%28Chopin%29">Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2</a> was played, in <a href="Napol%C3%A9on%20Henri%20Reber">Reber</a>'s instrumentation.

Chopin's tombstone, featuring the <a href="muse">muse</a> of music, <a href="Euterpe">Euterpe</a>, weeping over a broken <a href="lyre">lyre</a>, was designed and sculpted by Clésinger. The expenses of the funeral and monument, amounting to 5,000 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid for the return of the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw. As requested by Chopin, Ludwika took his heart (which had been removed by his doctor <a href="Jean%20Cruveilhier">Jean Cruveilhier</a> and preserved in alcohol in a vase), back to Poland in 1850. She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who destroyed them.

<a href="Chopin%27s%20disease">Chopin's disease</a> and the cause of his death have been a matter of discussion. His death certificate gave the cause of death as <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, and his physician, Cruveilhier, was then the leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities that have been advanced have included <a href="cystic%20fibrosis">cystic fibrosis</a>, <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a>, and <a href="alpha%201-antitrypsin%20deficiency">alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency</a>. A visual examination of Chopin's preserved heart (the jar was not opened), conducted in 2014 and published in 2017, suggested that the likely cause of his death was a rare case of <a href="pericarditis">pericarditis</a> caused by complications of chronic tuberculosis.

Over 230 works of Chopin survive; some compositions from early childhood have been lost. All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either <a href="piano%20concerto">piano concerto</a>s, songs or <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a>.

Chopin was educated in the tradition of Beethoven, <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>, Mozart and <a href="Muzio%20Clementi">Clementi</a>; he used Clementi's piano method with his own students. He was also influenced by <a href="Johann%20Nepomuk%20Hummel">Hummel</a>'s development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a> and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook. Chopin's early works are in the style of the "brilliant" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of <a href="Ignaz%20Moscheles">Ignaz Moscheles</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20Kalkbrenner">Friedrich Kalkbrenner</a>, and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of <a href="Italian%20opera">Italian opera</a>. Much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his "<a href="fioritura">fioriture</a>") is taken from singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the <a href="mode%20%28music%29">modes</a> and features of the music of his native country, such as <a href="drone%20%28music%29">drones</a>.

Chopin took the new salon genre of the <a href="nocturne">nocturne</a>, invented by the Irish composer <a href="John%20Field%20%28composer%29">John Field</a>, to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write <a href="ballade%20%28classical%20music%29">ballades</a> and <a href="Scherzo">scherzi</a> as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op. 28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert <a href="%C3%A9tude">étude</a>, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op. 10 published in 1833, Op. 25 in 1837).

Chopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression. <a href="Mazurkas%20%28Chopin%29">Chopin's mazurkas</a>, while originating in the traditional Polish dance (the "<a href="mazurka">mazurek</a>"), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; as J. Barrie Jones puts it, "it was Chopin who put the mazurka on the European musical map." The series of seven <a href="Polonaises%20%28Chopin%29">polonaises</a> published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with the Op. 26 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the form. His <a href="Waltzes%20%28Chopin%29">waltzes</a> were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance-floor equivalents.

Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the <a href="%C3%89tude%20Op.%2010%2C%20No.%2012%20%28Chopin%29">"Revolutionary" Étude</a> (Op. 10, No. 12), and the "<a href="Minute%20Waltz">Minute Waltz</a>" (Op. 64, No. 1). However, with the exception of his "Funeral March", the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the "Revolutionary" Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The "Funeral March", the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.

The last <a href="opus%20number">opus number</a> that Chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At the request of the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66–73), published in 1855. In 1857, <a href="Polish%20songs%20%28Chopin%29">17 Polish songs</a> that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.

Works published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers. The present standard musicological reference for Chopin's works is the Kobylańska Catalogue (usually represented by the initials 'KK'), named for its compiler, the Polish musicologist <a href="Krystyna%20Kobyla%C5%84ska">Krystyna Kobylańska</a>.

Chopin's original publishers included Maurice Schlesinger and Camille Pleyel. His works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies. The first collected edition was by <a href="Breitkopf%20%26amp%3B%20H%C3%A4rtel">Breitkopf & Härtel</a> (1878–1902). Among modern scholarly editions of Chopin's works are the version under the name of <a href="Ignacy%20Jan%20Paderewski">Paderewski</a> published between 1937 and 1966 and the more recent Polish "National Edition", edited by <a href="Jan%20Ekier">Jan Ekier</a>, both of which contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.

Chopin published his music in France, England and the German states due to the copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of ‘first editions’. Each edition is different from the other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.

<a href="Musical%20improvisation">Improvisation</a> stands at the centre of Chopin's creative processes. However, this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that "improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form." The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by Temperley to be "merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing ... formally longwinded and extremely conservative". After the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and for cello; "instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure." Rosen suggests that an important aspect of Chopin's individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar <a href="phrase%20%28music%29">phrase</a> as a structural unit.

J. Barrie Jones suggests that "amongst the works that Chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme", and adds that "the <a href="Barcarole%20%28Chopin%29">Barcarolle</a> Op. 60 stands apart as an example of Chopin's rich harmonic palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody." Temperley opines that these works, which contain "immense variety of mood, thematic material and structural detail", are based on an extended "departure and return" form; "the more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes."

Chopin's mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward <a href="ternary%20form">ternary</a> or episodic form, sometimes with a <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a>. The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example Op. 63 No. 3, which includes a <a href="canon%20%28music%29">canon</a> at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.

Chopin's polonaises show a marked advance on those of his Polish predecessors in the form (who included his teachers Żywny and Elsner). As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.

The 21 <a href="Nocturnes%20%28Chopin%29">nocturnes</a> are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than those of Field (whom Chopin met in 1833). Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult demands on the performer) which heightens their dramatic character.

Chopin's études are largely in straightforward ternary form. He used them to teach his own technique of piano playing—for instance playing double <a href="third%20%28chord%29">thirds</a> (<a href="%C3%89tude%20Op.%2025%2C%20No.%206%20%28Chopin%29">Op. 25, No. 6</a>), playing in octaves (<a href="%C3%89tude%20Op.%2025%2C%20No.%2010%20%28Chopin%29">Op. 25, No. 10</a>), and playing repeated notes (<a href="%C3%89tude%20Op.%2010%2C%20No.%207%20%28Chopin%29">Op. 10, No.  7</a>).

The preludes, many of which are very brief (some consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure), were described by Schumann as "the beginnings of studies". Inspired by J.S. Bach's "<a href="The%20Well-Tempered%20Clavier">The Well-Tempered Clavier</a>", Chopin's preludes move up the <a href="circle%20of%20fifths">circle of fifths</a> (rather than Bach's <a href="chromatic%20scale">chromatic scale</a> sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality. The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers, as <a href="Kenneth%20Hamilton">Kenneth Hamilton</a> suggests: he has noted a recording by <a href="Ferruccio%20Busoni">Ferruccio Busoni</a> of 1922, in which the Prelude Op. 28 No. 7 is followed by the Étude Op. 10 No. 5.

The two mature piano sonatas (<a href="Piano%20Sonata%20No.%202%20%28Chopin%29">No. 2</a>, Op. 35, written in 1839 and No. 3, Op. 58, written in 1844) are in four movements. In Op. 35, Chopin was able to combine within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique—"a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle". The sonata has been considered as showing the influences of both Bach and Beethoven. The Prelude from Bach's <a href="Cello%20Suites%20%28Bach%29%23Suite%20No.%206%20in%20D%20major%2C%20BWV%201012">Suite No. 6 in D major for cello</a> (BWV 1012) is quoted; and there are references to two sonatas of Beethoven: the <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20No.%2032%20%28Beethoven%29">Sonata Opus 111</a> in C minor, and the <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20No.%2012%20%28Beethoven%29">Sonata Opus 26</a> in A flat major, which, like Chopin's Op. 35, has a <a href="funeral%20march">funeral march</a> as its slow movement. The last movement of Chopin's Op. 35, a brief (75-bar) <a href="perpetuum%20mobile">perpetuum mobile</a> in which the hands play in unmodified octave unison throughout, was found shocking and unmusical by contemporaries, including Schumann. The Op. 58 sonata is closer to the German tradition, including many passages of complex <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>, "worthy of <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>" according to the music historians Kornel Michałowski and Jim Samson.

Chopin's harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique. Temperley says that in his works "novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary <a href="appoggiatura">appoggiatura</a>s or <a href="passing%20notes">passing notes</a> with melodic figures of accompaniment", and <a href="cadence%20%28music%29">cadences</a> are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key (<a href="neapolitan%20sixth">neapolitan sixth</a>s and <a href="diminished%20seventh">diminished seventh</a>s), or by sudden shifts to remote keys. <a href="Chord%20progression">Chord progression</a>s sometimes anticipate the shifting <a href="tonality">tonality</a> of later composers such as <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>, as does Chopin's use of modal harmony.

In 1841, <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Escudier">Léon Escudier</a> wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, "One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace." Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his "Projet de méthode" he wrote: "Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering ... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm." He further stated: "One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity." The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double <a href="octave">octave</a>s and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of <a href="grace%20notes">grace notes</a>, and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.

<a href="Jonathan%20Bellman">Jonathan Bellman</a> writes that modern concert performance style—set in the "<a href="music%20school">conservatory</a>" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings—militates against what is known of Chopin's more intimate performance technique. The composer himself said to a pupil that "concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art." Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as "always crescendo to a high note", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring. Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin "has created a kind of chromatic embroidery ... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe ... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn". Hiller wrote that "What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers."

Chopin's music is frequently played with "<a href="Tempo%20rubato">rubato</a>", "the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect". There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of "rubato" is appropriate for his works. <a href="Charles%20Rosen">Charles Rosen</a> comments that "most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas ... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart ... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass ... An allied form of this rubato is the <a href="arpeggio">arpeggiation</a> of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil <a href="Karol%20Mikuli">Karol Mikuli</a>, Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice."

Friederike Müller, a pupil of Chopin, wrote: "[His] playing was always noble and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full "<a href="forte%20%28dynamic%29">forte</a>" or softest "<a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29">piano</a>". He took infinite pains to teach his pupils this "<a href="legato">legato</a>", "<a href="cantabile">cantabile</a>" style of playing. His most severe criticism was 'He—or she—does not know how to join two notes together.' He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced "rubatos", as well as exaggerated "<a href="Tempo">ritardandos</a>" ... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works."

With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>. Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native Poland, writing that "Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the <a href="November%20Uprising">November Uprising</a> of 1830], their appeal to us artists is even stronger ... If the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e. <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Nicholas I of Russia</a>] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!" The biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by <a href="Carolyne%20zu%20Sayn-Wittgenstein">Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein</a>) states that Chopin "must be ranked first among the first musicians ... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation."

Some modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin's primacy as a "nationalist" or "patriotic" composer. George Golos refers to earlier "nationalist" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's <a href="Micha%C5%82%20Kleofas%20Ogi%C5%84ski">Michał Kleofas Ogiński</a> and <a href="Franciszek%20Lessel">Franciszek Lessel</a>, who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms. Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more from "urbanised" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts (by Jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis. <a href="Richard%20Taruskin">Richard Taruskin</a> impugns Schumann's attitude toward Chopin's works as patronizing and comments that Chopin "felt his Polish patriotism deeply and sincerely" but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and Field.

A reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Atwood: "Undoubtedly [Chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World ... While some sought solace in [them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom. Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the Polish people ..."

Jones comments that "Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned." He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831—"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons"—and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation. While his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of <a href="romanticism">romanticism</a>, the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soirées) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that "his lack of <a href="Lord%20Byron">Byronic</a> flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional" among his romantic contemporaries, such as Liszt and Henri Herz.

Chopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognized by many of his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite "<a href="Carnaval%20%28Schumann%29">Carnaval</a>", and Chopin later dedicated his <a href="Ballade%20No.%202%20%28Chopin%29">Ballade No. 2 in F major</a> to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.

Two of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli (1821–1897) and Georges Mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to their own students, some of whom (such as <a href="Raoul%20Koczalski">Raoul Koczalski</a>) were to make recordings of his music. Other pianists and composers influenced by Chopin's style include <a href="Louis%20Moreau%20Gottschalk">Louis Moreau Gottschalk</a>, Édouard Wolff (1816–1880) and Pierre Zimmermann. Debussy dedicated <a href="%C3%89tudes%20%28Debussy%29">his own 1915 piano Études</a> to the memory of Chopin; he frequently played Chopin's music during his studies at the <a href="Paris%20Conservatoire">Paris Conservatoire</a>, and undertook the editing of Chopin's piano music for the publisher Jacques Durand.
Polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as <a href="Moritz%20Moszkowski">Moritz Moszkowski</a>, but, in the opinion of J. Barrie Jones, his "one worthy successor" among his compatriots was <a href="Karol%20Szymanowski">Karol Szymanowski</a> (1882–1937). <a href="Edvard%20Grieg">Edvard Grieg</a>, <a href="Anton%C3%ADn%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k">Antonín Dvořák</a>, <a href="Isaac%20Alb%C3%A9niz">Isaac Albéniz</a>, <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a> and <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a>, among others, are regarded by critics as having been influenced by Chopin's use of national modes and idioms. <a href="Alexander%20Scriabin">Alexander Scriabin</a> was devoted to the music of Chopin, and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas, as well as numerous études and preludes; his teacher <a href="Nikolai%20Zverev">Nikolai Zverev</a> drilled him in Chopin's works to improve his virtuosity as a performer. In the 20th century, composers who paid homage to (or in some cases parodied) the music of Chopin included <a href="George%20Crumb">George Crumb</a>, <a href="Bohuslav%20Martin%C5%AF">Bohuslav Martinů</a>, <a href="Darius%20Milhaud">Darius Milhaud</a>,
<a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a> and <a href="Heitor%20Villa-Lobos">Heitor Villa-Lobos</a>.

Chopin's music was used in the 1909 ballet "<a href="Les%20Sylphides">Chopiniana</a>", choreographed by <a href="Michel%20Fokine">Michel Fokine</a> and orchestrated by <a href="Alexander%20Glazunov">Alexander Glazunov</a>. <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Sergei Diaghilev</a> commissioned additional orchestrations—from Stravinsky, <a href="Anatoly%20Lyadov">Anatoly Lyadov</a>, <a href="Sergei%20Taneyev">Sergei Taneyev</a> and <a href="Nikolai%20Tcherepnin">Nikolai Tcherepnin</a>—for later productions, which used the title "Les Sylphides".

Chopin's music remains very popular and is regularly performed, recorded and broadcast worldwide. The world's oldest monographic music competition, the <a href="International%20Chopin%20Piano%20Competition">International Chopin Piano Competition</a>, founded in 1927, is held every five years in Warsaw. The <a href="Fryderyk%20Chopin%20Institute">Fryderyk Chopin Institute</a> of Poland lists on its website over eighty societies worldwide devoted to the composer and his music. The Institute site also lists nearly 1,500 performances of Chopin works on YouTube .

The <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> notes that "Chopin's works have been recorded by all the great pianists of the recording era." The earliest recording was an 1895 performance by <a href="Pavel%20Pabst">Paul Pabst</a> of the Nocturne in E major Op. 62 No. 2. The British Library site makes available a number of historic recordings, including some by <a href="Alfred%20Cortot">Alfred Cortot</a>, <a href="Ignaz%20Friedman">Ignaz Friedman</a>, <a href="Vladimir%20Horowitz">Vladimir Horowitz</a>, <a href="Benno%20Moiseiwitsch">Benno Moiseiwitsch</a>, <a href="Ignacy%20Jan%20Paderewski">Ignacy Jan Paderewski</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Rubinstein">Arthur Rubinstein</a>, <a href="Xaver%20Scharwenka">Xaver Scharwenka</a> and many others. A select discography of recordings of Chopin works by pianists representing the various pedagogic traditions stemming from Chopin is given by Methuen-Campbell in his work tracing the lineage and character of those traditions.

Numerous recordings of Chopin's works are available. On the occasion of the composer's bicentenary, the critics of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" recommended performances by the following contemporary pianists (among many others): <a href="Martha%20Argerich">Martha Argerich</a>, <a href="Vladimir%20Ashkenazy">Vladimir Ashkenazy</a>, <a href="Emanuel%20Ax">Emanuel Ax</a>, <a href="Evgeny%20Kissin">Evgeny Kissin</a>, <a href="Murray%20Perahia">Murray Perahia</a>, <a href="Maurizio%20Pollini">Maurizio Pollini</a> and <a href="Krystian%20Zimerman">Krystian Zimerman</a>. The Warsaw Chopin Society organizes the "Grand prix du disque de F. Chopin" for notable Chopin recordings, held every five years.

Chopin has figured extensively in Polish literature, both in serious critical studies of his life and music and in fictional treatments. The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 <a href="sonnet">sonnet</a> on Chopin by Leon Ulrich. French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a> and <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gide">André Gide</a>; and he has also featured in works of <a href="Gottfried%20Benn">Gottfried Benn</a> and <a href="Boris%20Pasternak">Boris Pasternak</a>. There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English (see <a href="%23Bibliography">bibliography</a> for some of these).

Possibly the first venture into fictional treatments of Chopin's life was a fanciful operatic version of some of its events. "<a href="Chopin%20%28opera%29">Chopin</a>" was written by <a href="Giacomo%20Orefice">Giacomo Orefice</a> and produced in Milan in 1901. All the music is derived from that of Chopin.

Franz Kafka

Franz Kafka (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was a <a href="German%20language">German-speaking</a> <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>n <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> novelist and short story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of <a href="20th%20century%20in%20literature">20th-century literature</a>. His work, which fuses elements of <a href="literary%20realism">realism</a> and the <a href="fantastic">fantastic</a>, typically features isolated protagonists faced by bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible social-<a href="bureaucratic">bureaucratic</a> powers, and has been interpreted as exploring themes of <a href="social%20alienation">alienation</a>, <a href="existential%20anxiety">existential anxiety</a>, <a href="guilt%20%28emotion%29">guilt</a>, and <a href="absurdity">absurdity</a>. His best known works include "" ("The Metamorphosis"), ("The Trial"), and ("The Castle"). The term "" has entered the English language to describe situations like those in his writing.

Kafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Jewish</a> family in <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, the capital of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia">Kingdom of Bohemia</a>, then part of the <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>, today the capital of the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>. He trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education was employed by an insurance company, forcing him to relegate writing to his spare time. Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship. He became engaged to several women but never married. He died in 1924 at the age of 40 from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>.

Few of Kafka's works were published during his lifetime: the story collections ("Contemplation") and ("A Country Doctor"), and individual stories (such as "") were published in literary magazines but received little public attention. Kafka's unfinished works, including his novels , and (translated as both "Amerika" and "The Man Who Disappeared"), were ordered by Kafka to be destroyed by his friend <a href="Max%20Brod">Max Brod</a>, who nonetheless ignored his friend's direction and published them after Kafka's death. His work went on to influence a vast range of writers, critics, artists, and philosophers during the 20th century.

Kafka was born near the <a href="Old%20Town%20Square%20%28Prague%29">Old Town Square</a> in <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, then part of the <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>. His family were German-speaking middle-class <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a>. His father, Hermann Kafka (1854–1931), was the fourth child of Jakob Kafka, a or <a href="Shechita">ritual slaughterer</a> in <a href="Osek%20%28Strakonice%20District%29">Osek</a>, a Czech village with a large Jewish population located near <a href="Strakonice">Strakonice</a> in southern Bohemia. Hermann brought the Kafka family to Prague. After working as a travelling sales representative, he eventually became a fashion retailer who employed up to 15 people and used the image of a <a href="Western%20Jackdaw">jackdaw</a> ( in Czech, pronounced and colloquially written as "kafka") as his business logo. Kafka's mother, Julie (1856–1934), was the daughter of Jakob Löwy, a prosperous retail merchant in <a href="Pod%C4%9Bbrady">Poděbrady</a>, and was better educated than her husband.
Kafka's parents probably spoke a German influenced by <a href="Yiddish%20language">Yiddish</a> that was sometimes pejoratively called <a href="Yiddish%20language%23Secularization">Mauscheldeutsch</a>, but, as the German language was considered the vehicle of social mobility, they probably encouraged their children to speak <a href="Standard%20German">Standard German</a>. Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest. Franz's two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele ("Ellie") (1889–1944), Valerie ("Valli") (1890–1942) and <a href="Ottla%20Kafka">Ottilie</a> ("Ottla") (1892–1943). They all died during the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> of World War II. Valli was deported to the <a href="%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA%20Ghetto">Łódź Ghetto</a> in occupied Poland in 1942, but that is the last documentation of her. Ottilie was his favourite sister.

Hermann is described by the biographer Stanley Corngold as a "huge, selfish, overbearing businessman" and by Franz Kafka as "a true Kafka in strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance, endurance, presence of mind, [and] knowledge of human nature". On business days, both parents were absent from the home, with Julie Kafka working as many as 12 hours each day helping to manage the family business. Consequently, Kafka's childhood was somewhat lonely, and the children were reared largely by a series of governesses and servants. Kafka's troubled relationship with his father is evident in his ("Letter to His Father") of more than 100 pages, in which he complains of being profoundly affected by his father's authoritarian and demanding character; his mother, in contrast, was quiet and shy. The dominating figure of Kafka's father had a significant influence on Kafka's writing.

The Kafka family had a servant girl living with them in a cramped apartment. Franz's room was often cold. In November 1913 the family moved into a bigger apartment, although Ellie and Valli had married and moved out of the first apartment. In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in this larger apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children. Franz at age 31 moved into Valli's former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the first time.

From 1889 to 1893, Kafka attended the German boys' elementary school at the (meat market), now known as Masná Street. His Jewish education ended with his <a href="Bar%20and%20Bat%20Mitzvah">Bar Mitzvah</a> celebration at the age of 13. Kafka never enjoyed attending the synagogue and went with his father only on four high holidays a year.

After leaving elementary school in 1893, Kafka was admitted to the rigorous classics-oriented state <a href="Gymnasium%20%28Germany%29">gymnasium</a>, , an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, within the <a href="Kinsk%C3%BD%20Palace%20%28Prague%29">Kinský Palace</a>. German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech. He studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades. Although Kafka received compliments for his Czech, he never considered himself fluent in Czech, though he spoke German with a Czech accent. He completed his <a href="Matura">Matura</a> exams in 1901.

Admitted to the of Prague in 1901, Kafka began studying chemistry, but switched to law after two weeks. Although this field did not excite him, it offered a range of career possibilities which pleased his father. In addition, law required a longer course of study, giving Kafka time to take classes in German studies and art history. He also joined a student club, (Reading and Lecture Hall of the German students), which organised literary events, readings and other activities. Among Kafka's friends were the journalist <a href="Felix%20Weltsch">Felix Weltsch</a>, who studied philosophy, the actor <a href="Yitzchak%20Lowy">Yitzchak Lowy</a> who came from an orthodox <a href="Hasidic%20Judaism">Hasidic</a> Warsaw family, and the writers <a href="Oskar%20Baum">Oskar Baum</a> and <a href="Franz%20Werfel">Franz Werfel</a>.

At the end of his first year of studies, Kafka met <a href="Max%20Brod">Max Brod</a>, a fellow law student who became a close friend for life. Brod soon noticed that, although Kafka was shy and seldom spoke, what he said was usually profound. Kafka was an avid reader throughout his life; together he and Brod read Plato's "<a href="Protagoras%20%28dialogue%29">Protagoras</a>" in the original <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>, on Brod's initiative, and <a href="Flaubert">Flaubert</a>'s and ("The Temptation of Saint Anthony") in French, at his own suggestion. Kafka considered <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoyevsky">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</a>, Flaubert, <a href="Nikolai%20Gogol">Nikolai Gogol</a>, <a href="Franz%20Grillparzer">Franz Grillparzer</a>, and <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Kleist">Heinrich von Kleist</a> to be his "true <a href="blood%20brother">blood brother</a>s". Besides these, he took an interest in <a href="Czech%20literature">Czech literature</a> and was also very fond of the works of <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Goethe</a>. Kafka was awarded the degree of Doctor of Law on 18 July 1906 and performed an obligatory year of unpaid service as law clerk for the civil and criminal courts.

On 1 November 1907, Kafka was hired at the , an insurance company, where he worked for nearly a year. His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00—making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing when he joined the <a href="Workers%27%20compensation">Worker's Accident Insurance Institute</a> for the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia">Kingdom of Bohemia</a>. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for <a href="personal%20injury">personal injury</a> to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace owing to poor <a href="work%20safety">work safety</a> policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with <a href="machine">machine</a> <a href="lathe">lathe</a>s, <a href="drill">drill</a>s, <a href="planing%20machine">planing machine</a>s and <a href="rotary%20saw">rotary saw</a>s which were rarely fitted with safety guards.

The management professor <a href="Peter%20Drucker">Peter Drucker</a> credits Kafka with developing the first civilian <a href="hard%20hat">hard hat</a> while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute, but this is not supported by any document from his employer. His father often referred to his son's job as an insurance officer as a , literally "bread job", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums. He would compile and compose the <a href="annual%20report">annual report</a> on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors. Kafka usually got off work at 2 P.M., so that he had time to spend on his literary work, to which he was committed. Kafka's father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store. In his later years, Kafka's illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term ("The Close Prague Circle") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him.

In late 1911, Elli's husband Karl Hermann and Kafka became partners in the first <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a> factory in Prague, known as Prager Asbestwerke Hermann & Co., having used dowry money from Hermann Kafka. Kafka showed a positive attitude at first, dedicating much of his free time to the business, but he later resented the encroachment of this work on his writing time. During that period, he also found interest and entertainment in the performances of <a href="Yiddish%20theatre">Yiddish theatre</a>. After seeing a Yiddish theatre troupe perform in October 1911, for the next six months Kafka "immersed himself in Yiddish language and in Yiddish literature". This interest also served as a starting point for his growing exploration of Judaism. It was at about this time that Kafka became a vegetarian. Around 1915 Kafka received his draft notice for military service in World WarI, but his employers at the insurance institute arranged for a deferment because his work was considered essential government service. Later he attempted to join the military but was prevented from doing so by medical problems associated with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, with which he was diagnosed in 1917. In 1918 the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute put Kafka on a pension due to his illness, for which there was no cure at the time, and he spent most of the rest of his life in <a href="sanatorium">sanatorium</a>s.

Kafka never married. According to Brod, Kafka was "tortured" by sexual desire and Kafka's biographer <a href="Reiner%20Stach">Reiner Stach</a> states that his life was full of "incessant womanising" and that he was filled with a fear of "sexual failure". He visited brothels for most of his adult life and was interested in pornography. In addition, he had close relationships with several women during his life. On 13 August 1912, Kafka met <a href="Felice%20Bauer">Felice Bauer</a>, a relative of Brod, who worked in Berlin as a representative of a <a href="dictaphone">dictaphone</a> company. A week after the meeting at Brod's home, Kafka wrote in his diary:

Shortly after this, Kafka wrote the story "" ("The Judgment") in only one night and worked in a productive period on ("The Man Who Disappeared") and "<a href="The%20Metamorphosis">Die Verwandlung</a>" ("The Metamorphosis"). Kafka and Felice Bauer communicated mostly through letters over the next five years, met occasionally, and were engaged twice. Kafka's extant letters to her were published as ("Letters to Felice"); her letters do not survive. According to biographers Stach and <a href="James%20Hawes%20%28author%29">James Hawes</a>, around 1920 Kafka was engaged a third time, to Julie Wohryzek, a poor and uneducated hotel chambermaid. Although the two rented a flat and set a wedding date, the marriage never took place. During this time Kafka began a draft of the "Letter to His Father", who objected to Julie because of her <a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> beliefs. Before the date of the intended marriage, he took up with yet another woman. While he needed women and sex in his life, he had low self-confidence, felt sex was dirty, and was shy—especially about his body.

Stach and Brod state that during the time that Kafka knew Felice Bauer, he had an affair with a friend of hers, Margarethe "Grete" Bloch, a Jewish woman from Berlin. Brod says that Bloch gave birth to Kafka's son, although Kafka never knew about the child. The boy, whose name is not known, was born in 1914 or 1915 and died in Munich in 1921. However, Kafka's biographer Peter-André Alt claims that, while Bloch had a son, Kafka was not the father as the pair were never intimate. Stach states that Bloch had a son, but there is not solid proof and moreover contradictory evidence that Kafka was the father.

Kafka was diagnosed with tuberculosis in August 1917 and moved for a few months to the <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>n village of Zürau (Siřem in the <a href="Czech%20language">Czech language</a>), where his sister Ottla worked on the farm of her brother-in-law Karl Hermann. He felt comfortable there and later described this time as perhaps the best time in his life, probably because he had no responsibilities. He kept diaries and (<a href="octavo">octavo</a>). From the notes in these books, Kafka extracted 109 numbered pieces of text on "Zettel", single pieces of paper in no given order. They were later published as (The Zürau Aphorisms or Reflections on Sin, Hope, Suffering, and the True Way).

In 1920 Kafka began an intense relationship with <a href="Milena%20Jesensk%C3%A1">Milena Jesenská</a>, a Czech journalist and writer. His letters to her were later published as . During a vacation in July 1923 to <a href="Graal-M%C3%BCritz">Graal-Müritz</a> on the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, Kafka met <a href="Dora%20Diamant">Dora Diamant</a>, a 25-year-old kindergarten teacher from an orthodox Jewish family. Kafka, hoping to escape the influence of his family to concentrate on his writing, moved briefly to Berlin and lived with Diamant. She became his lover and caused him to become interested in the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>. He worked on four stories, which he prepared to be published as ("A Hunger Artist").

Kafka feared that people would find him mentally and physically repulsive. However, those who met him found him to possess a quiet and cool demeanor, obvious intelligence, and a dry sense of humour; they also found him boyishly handsome, although of austere appearance. Brod compared Kafka to <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Kleist">Heinrich von Kleist</a>, noting that both writers had the ability to describe a situation realistically with precise details. Brod thought Kafka was one of the most entertaining people he had met; Kafka enjoyed sharing humour with his friends, but also helped them in difficult situations with good advice. According to Brod, he was a passionate reciter, who was able to phrase his speaking as if it were music. Brod felt that two of Kafka's most distinguishing traits were "absolute truthfulness" () and "precise conscientiousness" (). He explored details, the inconspicuous, in depth and with such love and precision that things surfaced that were unforeseen, seemingly strange, but absolutely true ().

Although Kafka showed little interest in exercise as a child, he later showed interest in games and physical activity, as a good rider, swimmer, and rower. On weekends he and his friends embarked on long hikes, often planned by Kafka himself. His other interests included <a href="Naturopathy">alternative medicine</a>, modern education systems such as <a href="Montessori%20education">Montessori</a>, and technical novelties such as airplanes and film. Writing was important to Kafka; he considered it a "form of prayer". He was highly sensitive to noise and preferred quiet when writing.

Pérez-Álvarez has claimed that Kafka may have possessed a <a href="schizoid%20personality%20disorder">schizoid personality disorder</a>. His style, it is claimed, not only in "Die Verwandlung" ("The Metamorphosis"), but in various other writings, appears to show low to medium-level schizoid traits, which explain much of his work. His anguish can be seen in this diary entry from 21 June 1913:

and in Zürau Aphorism number 50:

Alessia Coralli and Antonio Perciaccante of San Giovanni di Dio Hospital have posited that Kafka may have had <a href="borderline%20personality%20disorder">borderline personality disorder</a> with co-occurring psychophysiological <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>. <a href="Joan%20Lachkar">Joan Lachkar</a> interpreted "Die Verwandlung" as "a vivid depiction of the borderline personality" and described the story as "model for Kafka's own abandonment fears, anxiety, depression, and parasitic dependency needs. Kafka illuminated the borderline's general confusion of normal and healthy desires, wishes, and needs with something ugly and disdainful."

Though Kafka never married, he held marriage and children in high esteem. He had several girlfriends. He may have suffered from an eating disorder. Doctor Manfred M. Fichter of the Psychiatric Clinic, <a href="University%20of%20Munich">University of Munich</a>, presented "evidence for the hypothesis that the writer Franz Kafka had suffered from an atypical <a href="anorexia%20nervosa">anorexia nervosa</a>", and that Kafka was not just lonely and depressed but also "occasionally suicidal". In his 1995 book "Franz Kafka, the Jewish Patient", <a href="Sander%20Gilman">Sander Gilman</a> investigated "why a Jew might have been considered '<a href="hypochondriacal">hypochondriacal</a>' or 'homosexual' and how Kafka incorporates aspects of these ways of understanding the Jewish male into his own self-image and writing". Kafka considered committing suicide at least once, in late 1912.

Prior to World War I, Kafka attended several meetings of the "Klub mladých", a Czech anarchist, <a href="Antimilitarism">anti-militarist</a>, and <a href="Anti-clericalism">anti-clerical</a> organization. <a href="Hugo%20Bergmann">Hugo Bergmann</a>, who attended the same elementary and high schools as Kafka, fell out with Kafka during their last academic year (1900–1901) because "[Kafka's] socialism and my <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a> were much too strident". "Franz became a socialist, I became a Zionist in 1898. The synthesis of Zionism and socialism did not yet exist". Bergmann claims that Kafka wore a red carnation to school to show his support for socialism. In one diary entry, Kafka made reference to the influential anarchist philosopher <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>: "Don't forget Kropotkin!"

During the communist era, the legacy of Kafka's work for Eastern bloc socialism was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from the notion that he satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungarian Empire</a>, to the belief that he embodied the rise of socialism. A further key point was <a href="Marx%27s%20theory%20of%20alienation">Marx's theory of alienation</a>. While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in <a href="Liblice">Liblice</a>, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.

Kafka grew up in Prague as a German-speaking Jew. He was deeply fascinated by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who he thought possessed an intensity of spiritual life that was absent from Jews in the West. His diary is full of references to <a href="Yiddish%20literature">Yiddish writers</a>. Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life: "What have I in common with Jews? I have hardly anything in common with myself and should stand very quietly in a corner, content that I can breathe". In his adolescent years, Kafka had declared himself an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>.

Hawes suggests that Kafka, though very aware of his own <a href="Jewish%20peoplehood">Jewishness</a>, did not incorporate it into his work, which, according to Hawes, lacks Jewish characters, scenes or themes. In the opinion of literary critic <a href="Harold%20Bloom">Harold Bloom</a>, although Kafka was uneasy with his Jewish heritage, he was the quintessential Jewish writer. Lothar Kahn is likewise unequivocal: "The presence of Jewishness in Kafka's is no longer subject to doubt". <a href="Pavel%20Eisner">Pavel Eisner</a>, one of Kafka's first translators, interprets ("The Trial") as the embodiment of the "triple dimension of Jewish existence in Prague... his protagonist Josef K. is (symbolically) arrested by a German (Rabensteiner), a Czech (Kullich), and a Jew (Kaminer). He stands for the 'guiltless guilt' that imbues the Jew in the modern world, although there is no evidence that he himself is a Jew".

In his essay "Sadness in Palestine?!", <a href="Dan%20Miron">Dan Miron</a> explores Kafka's connection to Zionism: "It seems that those who claim that there was such a connection and that Zionism played a central role in his life and literary work, and those who deny the connection altogether or dismiss its importance, are both wrong. The truth lies in some very elusive place between these two simplistic poles". Kafka considered moving to <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a> with Felice Bauer, and later with Dora Diamant. He studied <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> while living in Berlin, hiring a friend of Brod's from Palestine, Pua Bat-Tovim, to tutor him and attending Rabbi Julius Grünthal's and Rabbi <a href="Julius%20Guttmann">Julius Guttmann</a>'s classes in the Berlin (College for the Study of Judaism).

Livia Rothkirchen calls Kafka the "symbolic figure of his era". His contemporaries included numerous Jewish, Czech, and German writers who were sensitive to Jewish, Czech, and German culture. According to Rothkirchen, "This situation lent their writings a broad cosmopolitan outlook and a quality of exaltation bordering on transcendental metaphysical contemplation. An illustrious example is Franz Kafka".

Towards the end of his life Kafka sent a postcard to his friend Hugo Bergman in Tel Aviv, announcing his intention to emigrate to Palestine. Bergman refused to host Kafka because he had young children and was afraid that Kafka would infect them with tuberculosis.

Kafka's <a href="Larynx">laryngeal</a> <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> worsened and in March 1924 he returned from Berlin to Prague, where members of his family, principally his sister Ottla, took care of him. He went to Dr. Hoffmann's sanatorium in <a href="Klosterneuburg">Kierling</a> just outside <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> for treatment on 10 April, and died there on 3 June 1924. The cause of death seemed to be starvation: the condition of Kafka's throat made eating too painful for him, and since <a href="parenteral%20nutrition">parenteral nutrition</a> had not yet been developed, there was no way to feed him. Kafka was editing "A Hunger Artist" on his deathbed, a story whose composition he had begun before his throat closed to the point that he could not take any nourishment. His body was brought back to Prague where he was buried on 11 June 1924, in the <a href="New%20Jewish%20Cemetery%2C%20Prague">New Jewish Cemetery</a> in <a href="%C5%BDi%C5%BEkov">Prague-Žižkov</a>. Kafka was virtually unknown during his own lifetime, but he did not consider fame important. He rose to fame rapidly after his death, particularly after World War II. The Kafka tombstone was designed by architect <a href="Leopold%20Ehrmann">Leopold Ehrmann</a>.

All of Kafka's published works, except some letters he wrote in Czech to Milena Jesenská, were written in German. What little was published during his lifetime attracted scant public attention.

Kafka finished none of his full-length novels and burned around 90 percent of his work, much of it during the period he lived in Berlin with Diamant, who helped him burn the drafts. In his early years as a writer, he was influenced by von Kleist, whose work he described in a letter to Bauer as frightening, and whom he considered closer than his own family.

Kafka's earliest published works were eight stories which appeared in 1908 in the first issue of the literary journal "<a href="Hyperion%20%28journal%29">Hyperion</a>" under the title ("Contemplation"). He wrote the story "" ("Description of a Struggle") in 1904; he showed it to Brod in 1905 who advised him to continue writing and convinced him to submit it to "Hyperion". Kafka published a fragment in 1908 and two sections in the spring of 1909, all in Munich.

In a creative outburst on the night of 22 September 1912, Kafka wrote the story "Das Urteil" ("The Judgment", literally: "The Verdict") and dedicated it to Felice Bauer. Brod noted the similarity in names of the main character and his fictional fiancée, Georg Bendemann and Frieda Brandenfeld, to Franz Kafka and Felice Bauer. The story is often considered Kafka's breakthrough work. It deals with the troubled relationship of a son and his dominant father, facing a new situation after the son's engagement. Kafka later described writing it as "a complete opening of body and soul", a story that "evolved as a true birth, covered with filth and slime". The story was first published in Leipzig in 1912 and dedicated "to Miss Felice Bauer", and in subsequent editions "for F."

In 1912, Kafka wrote "Die Verwandlung" ("<a href="The%20Metamorphosis">The Metamorphosis</a>", or "The Transformation"), published in 1915 in Leipzig. The story begins with a travelling salesman waking to find himself transformed into a , a monstrous <a href="vermin">vermin</a>, being a general term for unwanted and unclean animals. Critics regard the work as one of the seminal works of fiction of the 20th century. The story "<a href="In%20the%20Penal%20Colony">In der Strafkolonie</a>" ("In the Penal Colony"), dealing with an elaborate <a href="torture">torture</a> and execution device, was written in October 1914, revised in 1918, and published in Leipzig during October 1919. The story "<a href="A%20Hunger%20Artist">Ein Hungerkünstler</a>" ("A Hunger Artist"), published in the periodical in 1924, describes a victimized protagonist who experiences a decline in the appreciation of his strange craft of <a href="hunger%20artist">starving himself for extended periods</a>. His last story, "<a href="Josephine%20the%20Singer%2C%20or%20the%20Mouse%20Folk">Josefine, die Sängerin oder Das Volk der Mäuse</a>" ("Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk"), also deals with the relationship between an artist and his audience.

He began his first novel in 1912; its first chapter is the story "<a href="The%20Stoker">Der Heizer</a>" ("The Stoker"). Kafka called the work, which remained unfinished, ("The Man Who Disappeared" or "The Missing Man"), but when Brod published it after Kafka's death he named it "Amerika". The inspiration for the novel was the time spent in the audience of Yiddish theatre the previous year, bringing him to a new awareness of his heritage, which led to the thought that an innate appreciation for one's heritage lives deep within each person. More explicitly humorous and slightly more realistic than most of Kafka's works, the novel shares the <a href="Motif%20%28narrative%29">motif</a> of an oppressive and intangible system putting the protagonist repeatedly in bizarre situations. It uses many details of experiences of his relatives who had emigrated to America and is the only work for which Kafka considered an optimistic ending.

During 1914, Kafka began the novel ("The Trial"), the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader. Kafka did not complete the novel, although he finished the final chapter. According to <a href="List%20of%20Nobel%20laureates%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize winner</a> and Kafka scholar <a href="Elias%20Canetti">Elias Canetti</a>, Felice is central to the plot of "Der Process" and Kafka said it was "her story". Canetti titled his book on Kafka's letters to Felice "Kafka's Other Trial", in recognition of the relationship between the letters and the novel. Michiko Kakutani notes in a review for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that Kafka's letters have the "earmarks of his fiction: the same nervous attention to minute particulars; the same paranoid awareness of shifting balances of power; the same atmosphere of emotional suffocation—combined, surprisingly enough, with moments of boyish ardor and delight."

According to his diary, Kafka was already planning his novel (The Castle), by 11 June 1914; however, he did not begin writing it until 27 January 1922. The protagonist is the (land surveyor) named K., who struggles for unknown reasons to gain access to the mysterious authorities of a castle who govern the village. Kafka's intent was that the castle's authorities notify K. on his deathbed that his "legal claim to live in the village was not valid, yet, taking certain auxiliary circumstances into account, he was to be permitted to live and work there". Dark and at times <a href="Surrealism">surreal</a>, the novel is focused on <a href="Social%20alienation">alienation</a>, <a href="bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a>, the seemingly endless frustrations of man's attempts to stand against the system, and the futile and hopeless pursuit of an unobtainable goal. Hartmut M. Rastalsky noted in his thesis: "Like dreams, his texts combine precise "realistic" detail with absurdity, careful observation and reasoning on the part of the protagonists with inexplicable obliviousness and carelessness."

Kafka's stories were initially published in literary periodicals. His first eight were printed in 1908 in the first issue of the bi-monthly "Hyperion". <a href="Franz%20Blei">Franz Blei</a> published two dialogues in 1909 which became part of "Beschreibung eines Kampfes" ("Description of a Struggle"). A fragment of the story "<a href="The%20Aeroplanes%20At%20Brescia">Die Aeroplane in Brescia</a>" ("The Aeroplanes at Brescia"), written on a trip to Italy with Brod, appeared in the daily "<a href="Bohemia%20%28newspaper%29">Bohemia</a>" on 28 September 1909. On 27 March 1910, several stories that later became part of the book were published in the Easter edition of "Bohemia". In Leipzig during 1913, Brod and publisher <a href="Kurt%20Wolff%20%28publisher%29">Kurt Wolff</a> included "" ("The Judgment. A Story by Franz Kafka.") in their literary yearbook for the art poetry "Arkadia". In the same year, Wolff published "<a href="The%20Stoker">Der Heizer</a>" ("The Stoker") in the Jüngste Tag series, where it enjoyed three printings. The story "" ("Before the Law") was published in the 1915 New Year's edition of the independent Jewish weekly ; it was reprinted in 1919 as part of the story collection ("A Country Doctor") and became part of the novel . Other stories were published in various publications, including <a href="Martin%20Buber">Martin Buber</a>'s "<a href="Der%20Jude%20%28magazine%29">Der Jude</a>", the paper , and the periodicals , "<a href="Genius%20%28magazine%29">Genius</a>", and "<a href="Prager%20Presse">Prager Presse</a>".

Kafka's first published book, ("Contemplation", or "Meditation"), was a collection of 18stories written between 1904 and 1912. On a summer trip to <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a>, Brod initiated a meeting between Kafka and Kurt Wolff; Wolff published in the at the end of 1912 (with the year given as 1913). Kafka dedicated it to Brod, "", and added in the personal copy given to his friend "" ("As it is already printed here, for my dearest Max").

Kafka's story "Die Verwandlung" ("The Metamorphosis") was first printed in the October 1915 issue of , a monthly edition of <a href="expressionism">expressionist</a> literature, edited by <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Schickele">René Schickele</a>. Another story collection, ("A Country Doctor"), was published by Kurt Wolff in 1919, dedicated to Kafka's father. Kafka prepared a final collection of four stories for print, "(A Hunger Artist)", which appeared in 1924 after his death, in . On 20 April 1924, the published Kafka's essay on <a href="Adalbert%20Stifter">Adalbert Stifter</a>.

Kafka left his work, both published and unpublished, to his friend and <a href="literary%20executor">literary executor</a> Max Brod with explicit instructions that it should be destroyed on Kafka's death; Kafka wrote: "Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread". Brod ignored this request and published the novels and collected works between 1925 and 1935. He took many papers, which remain unpublished, with him in suitcases to Palestine when he fled there in 1939. Kafka's last lover, Dora Diamant (later, Dymant-Lask), also ignored his wishes, secretly keeping 20notebooks and 35letters. These were confiscated by the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> in 1933, but scholars continue to search for them.

As Brod published the bulk of the writings in his possession, Kafka's work began to attract wider attention and critical acclaim. Brod found it difficult to arrange Kafka's notebooks in chronological order. One problem was that Kafka often began writing in different parts of the book; sometimes in the middle, sometimes working backwards from the end. Brod finished many of Kafka's incomplete works for publication. For example, Kafka left with unnumbered and incomplete chapters and with incomplete sentences and ambiguous content; Brod rearranged chapters, copy edited the text, and changed the punctuation. appeared in 1925 in . Kurt Wolff published two other novels, in 1926 and "Amerika" in 1927. In 1931, Brod edited a collection of prose and unpublished stories as "(The Great Wall of China)", including the <a href="The%20Great%20Wall%20of%20China%20%28short%20story%29">story of the same name</a>. The book appeared in the . Brod's sets are usually called the "Definitive Editions".

In 1961, <a href="Malcolm%20Pasley">Malcolm Pasley</a> acquired most of Kafka's original handwritten work for the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a>. The text for was later purchased through auction and is stored at the German Literary Archives in <a href="Marbach%20am%20Neckar">Marbach am Neckar</a>, Germany. Subsequently, Pasley headed a team (including <a href="Gerhard%20Neumann">Gerhard Neumann</a>, Jost Schillemeit and Jürgen Born) which reconstructed the German novels; republished them. Pasley was the editor for , published in 1982, and , published in 1990. Jost Schillemeit was the editor of () published in 1983. These are called the "Critical Editions" or the "Fischer Editions".

When Brod died in 1968, he left Kafka's unpublished papers, which are believed to number in the thousands, to his secretary <a href="Esther%20Hoffe">Esther Hoffe</a>. She released or sold some, but left most to her daughters, Eva and Ruth, who also refused to release the papers. A court battle began in 2008 between the sisters and the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Israel">National Library of Israel</a>, which claimed these works became the property of the nation of Israel when Brod emigrated to <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">British Palestine</a> in 1939. Esther Hoffe sold the original manuscript of for US$2 million in 1988 to the German Literary Archive <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Literature">Museum of Modern Literature</a> in Marbach am Neckar. Only Eva was still alive as of 2012. A ruling by a Tel Aviv family court in 2010 held that the papers must be released and a few were, including a previously unknown story, but the legal battle continued. The Hoffes claim the papers are their personal property, while the National Library argues they are "cultural assets belonging to the Jewish people". The National Library also suggests that Brod bequeathed the papers to them in his will. The Tel Aviv Family Court ruled in October 2012 that the papers were the property of the National Library.

The poet <a href="W.%20H.%20Auden">W. H. Auden</a> called Kafka "the <a href="Dante">Dante</a> of the twentieth century"; the novelist <a href="Vladimir%20Nabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</a> placed him among the greatest writers of the 20th century. <a href="Gabriel%20Garc%C3%ADa%20M%C3%A1rquez">Gabriel García Márquez</a> noted the reading of Kafka's "The Metamorphosis" showed him "that it was possible to write in a different way". A prominent theme of Kafka's work, first established in the short story "Das Urteil", is father–son conflict: the guilt induced in the son is resolved through suffering and atonement. Other prominent themes and archetypes include alienation, physical and psychological brutality, characters on a terrifying quest, and mystical transformation.

Kafka's style has been compared to that of Kleist as early as 1916, in a review of "Die Verwandlung" and "Der Heizer" by Oscar Walzel in "Berliner Beiträge". The nature of Kafka's prose allows for varied interpretations and critics have placed his writing into a variety of literary schools. <a href="Marxism">Marxists</a>, for example, have sharply disagreed over how to interpret Kafka's works. Some accused him of distorting reality whereas others claimed he was critiquing capitalism. The hopelessness and absurdity common to his works are seen as emblematic of <a href="existentialism">existentialism</a>. Some of Kafka's books are influenced by the <a href="expressionism">expressionist</a> movement, though the majority of his literary output was associated with the experimental <a href="modernism">modernist</a> genre. Kafka also touches on the theme of human conflict with bureaucracy. William Burroughs claims that such work is centred on the concepts of struggle, pain, solitude, and the need for relationships. Others, such as <a href="Thomas%20Mann">Thomas Mann</a>, see Kafka's work as allegorical: a quest, metaphysical in nature, for God.

According to <a href="Gilles%20Deleuze">Gilles Deleuze</a> and <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Guattari">Félix Guattari</a>, the themes of alienation and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer <a href="Milan%20Kundera">Milan Kundera</a> suggests that Kafka's <a href="surreal%20humour">surrealist humour</a> may have been an inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.

Attempts have been made to identify the influence of Kafka's legal background and the role of law in his fiction. Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work, in which the legal system is often oppressive. The law in Kafka's works, rather than being representative of any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of the people, who are innocent victims of systems beyond their control. Critics who support this <a href="absurdism">absurdist</a> interpretation cite instances where Kafka describes himself in conflict with an absurd universe, such as the following entry from his diary:

However, James Hawes argues many of Kafka's descriptions of the legal proceedings in —metaphysical, absurd, bewildering and nightmarish as they might appear—are based on accurate and informed descriptions of German and Austrian criminal proceedings of the time, which were <a href="Inquisitorial%20system">inquisitorial</a> rather than <a href="Adversarial%20system">adversarial</a>. Although he worked in insurance, as a trained lawyer Kafka was "keenly aware of the legal debates of his day". In an early 21st-century publication that uses Kafka's office writings as its point of departure, Pothik Ghosh states that with Kafka, law "has no meaning outside its fact of being a pure force of domination and determination".

The earliest English translations of Kafka's works were by <a href="Edwin%20Muir">Edwin</a> and <a href="Willa%20Muir">Willa Muir</a>, who in 1930 translated the first German edition of . This was published as "The Castle" by <a href="Secker%20%26amp%3B%20Warburg">Secker & Warburg</a> in England and <a href="Alfred%20A.%20Knopf">Alfred A. Knopf</a> in the United States. A 1941 edition, including a homage by Thomas Mann, spurred a surge in Kafka's popularity in the United States during the late 1940s. The Muirs translated all shorter works that Kafka had seen fit to print; they were published by <a href="Schocken%20Books">Schocken Books</a> in 1948 as "", including additionally "<a href="The%20First%20Long%20Train%20Journey">The First Long Train Journey</a>", written by Kafka and Brod, Kafka's "A Novel about Youth", a review of Felix Sternheim's "Die Geschichte des jungen Oswald", his essay on Kleist's "Anecdotes", his review of the literary magazine "<a href="Hyperion%20%28magazine%29">Hyperion</a>", and an epilogue by Brod.

Later editions, notably those of 1954 ("<a href="Dearest%20Father.%20Stories%20and%20Other%20Writings">Dearest Father. Stories and Other Writings</a>"), included text, translated by Eithne Wilkins and <a href="Ernst%20Kaiser%20%28author%29">Ernst Kaiser</a>, which had been deleted by earlier publishers. Known as "Definitive Editions", they include translations of "The Trial, Definitive", "<a href="The%20Castle%2C%20Definitive%20Edition%2C%20Muir%20Translation">The Castle, Definitive</a>", and other writings. These translations are generally accepted to have a number of biases and are considered to be dated in interpretation. Published in 1961 by Schocken Books, "<a href="Parables%20and%20Paradoxes">Parables and Paradoxes</a>" presented in a bilingual edition by <a href="Nahum%20N.%20Glatzer">Nahum N. Glatzer</a> selected writings, drawn from notebooks, diaries, letters, short fictional works and the novel "Der Process".

New translations were completed and published based on the recompiled German text of Pasley and Schillemeit"<a href="The%20Castle%2C%20Critical%20Edition%2C%20Harman%20Translation">The Castle, Critical</a>" by <a href="Mark%20Harman%20%28translator%29">Mark Harman</a> (<a href="Schocken%20Books">Schocken Books</a>, 1998), "The Trial, Critical" by <a href="Breon%20Mitchell">Breon Mitchell</a> (Schocken Books, 1998), and "Amerika: The Man Who Disappeared" by <a href="Michael%20Hofmann">Michael Hofmann</a> (<a href="New%20Directions%20Publishing">New Directions Publishing</a>, 2004).

Kafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to the German language which permits long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka's sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop—this being the finalizing meaning and focus. This is due to the construction of <a href="subordinate%20clauses%20in%20German">subordinate clauses in German</a> which require that the verb be positioned at the end of the sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in English, so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the same (or at least equivalent) effect found in the original text. German's more flexible word order and syntactical differences provide for multiple ways in which the same German writing can be translated into English. An example is the first sentence of Kafka's "The Metamorphosis", which is crucial to the setting and understanding of the entire story:

Another difficult problem facing translators is how to deal with the author's intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which results in phrasing that is difficult to translate precisely. One such instance is found in the first sentence of <a href="The%20Metamorphosis%23Lost%20in%20translation">"The Metamorphosis"</a>. English translators often render the word as "insect"; in Middle German, however, literally means "an animal unclean for sacrifice"; in today's German it means vermin. It is sometimes used colloquially to mean "bug" —a very general term, unlike the scientific "insect". Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation. Another example is Kafka's use of the German noun in the final sentence of "Das Urteil". Literally, means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic. The sentence can be translated as: "At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge". The double meaning of "Verkehr" is given added weight by Kafka's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of "a violent ejaculation".

Unlike many famous writers, Kafka is rarely quoted by others. Instead, he is noted more for his visions and perspective. Shimon Sandbank, a professor, literary critic, and writer, identifies Kafka as having influenced <a href="Jorge%20Luis%20Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, <a href="Albert%20Camus">Albert Camus</a>, <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Ionesco">Eugène Ionesco</a>, <a href="J.%20M.%20Coetzee">J. M. Coetzee</a> and <a href="Jean-Paul%20Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>. A "Financial Times" literary critic credits Kafka with influencing <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Saramago">José Saramago</a>, and Al Silverman, a writer and editor, states that <a href="J.%20D.%20Salinger">J. D. Salinger</a> loved to read Kafka's works. In 1999 a committee of 99 authors, scholars, and literary critics ranked and the second and ninth <a href="Best%20German%20Novels%20of%20the%20Twentieth%20Century">most significant German-language novels of the 20th century</a>. Sandbank argues that despite Kafka's pervasiveness, his enigmatic style has yet to be emulated. Neil Christian Pages, a professor of German Studies and Comparative Literature at <a href="Binghamton%20University">Binghamton University</a> who specialises in Kafka's works, says Kafka's influence transcends literature and literary scholarship; it impacts visual arts, music, and popular culture. Harry Steinhauer, a professor of German and Jewish literature, says that Kafka "has made a more powerful impact on literate society than any other writer of the twentieth century". Brod said that the 20th century will one day be known as the "century of Kafka".

Michel-André Bossy writes that Kafka created a rigidly inflexible and sterile bureaucratic universe. Kafka wrote in an aloof manner full of legal and scientific terms. Yet his serious universe also had insightful humour, all highlighting the "irrationality at the roots of a supposedly rational world". His characters are trapped, confused, full of guilt, frustrated, and lacking understanding of their surreal world. Much of the post-Kafka fiction, especially science fiction, follow the themes and precepts of Kafka's universe. This can be seen in the works of authors such as <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a> and <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>.

The following are examples of works across a range of literary, musical, and dramatic genres which demonstrate the extent of cultural influence:

The term "Kafkaesque" is used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of his work, particularly ("<a href="The%20Trial">The Trial</a>") and "Die Verwandlung" ("<a href="The%20Metamorphosis">The Metamorphosis</a>"). Examples include instances in which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical.
Numerous films and television works have been described as Kafkaesque, and the style is particularly prominent in dystopian science fiction. Works in this genre that have been thus described include <a href="Patrick%20Bokanowski">Patrick Bokanowski</a>'s 1982 film "<a href="The%20Angel%20%281982%20film%29">The Angel</a>", Terry Gilliam's 1985 film "<a href="Brazil%20%281985%20film%29">Brazil</a>", and the 1998 science fiction <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>, "<a href="Dark%20City%20%281998%20film%29">Dark City</a>". Films from other genres which have been similarly described include "<a href="The%20Tenant">The Tenant</a>" (1976) and "<a href="Barton%20Fink">Barton Fink</a>" (1991). The television series "<a href="The%20Prisoner">The Prisoner</a>" and "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone">The Twilight Zone</a>" are also frequently described as Kafkaesque.

However, with common usage, the term has become so ubiquitous that Kafka scholars note it's often misused. More accurately then, according to author Ben Marcus, paraphrased in "What it Means to be Kafkaesque" by Joe Fassler in "The Atlantic", "Kafka’s quintessential qualities are affecting use of language, a setting that straddles fantasy and reality, and a sense of striving even in the face of bleakness—hopelessly and full of hope." 

The <a href="Franz%20Kafka%20Museum">Franz Kafka Museum</a> in Prague is dedicated to Kafka and his work. A major component of the museum is an exhibit "The City of K. Franz Kafka and Prague", which was first shown in Barcelona in 1999, moved to the <a href="Jewish%20Museum%20%28New%20York%29">Jewish Museum</a> in New York City, and was finally established in 2005 in Prague in <a href="Mal%C3%A1%20Strana">Malá Strana</a> (Lesser Town), along the <a href="Vltava">Moldau</a>. The museum calls its display of original photos and documents "Město K. Franz Kafka a Praha" (City K. Kafka and Prague) and aims to immerse the visitor into the world in which Kafka lived and about which he wrote.

The <a href="Franz%20Kafka%20Prize">Franz Kafka Prize</a> is an annual literary award of the <a href="Franz%20Kafka%20Society">Franz Kafka Society</a> and the City of Prague established in 2001. It recognizes the merits of literature as "humanistic character and contribution to cultural, national, language and religious tolerance, its existential, timeless character, its generally human validity, and its ability to hand over a testimony about our times". The selection committee and recipients come from all over the world, but are limited to living authors who have had at least one work published in the Czech language. The recipient receives $10,000, a diploma, and a bronze statuette at a presentation in <a href="Old%20Town%20%28Prague%29">Prague's Old Town Hall</a> on the Czech State Holiday in late October.

<a href="San%20Diego%20State%20University">San Diego State University</a> (SDSU) operates the <a href="Kafka%20Project">Kafka Project</a>, which began in 1998 as the official international search for Kafka's last writings.

FIFA World Cup

The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international <a href="association%20football">association football</a> competition contested by the senior <a href="List%20of%20men%27s%20national%20association%20football%20teams">men's national teams</a> of the members of the "" (<a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the <a href="1930%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">inaugural tournament in 1930</a>, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. The current champion is <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>, which won its second title at the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018 tournament</a> in Russia.

The current format of the competition involves a <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualification phase</a>, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the "World Cup Finals". After this, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.

The 21 World Cup tournaments have been won by eight national teams. <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a> have won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a> and <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a>, with four titles each; <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a>, <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> and inaugural winner <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a>, with two titles each; and <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> and <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a> with one title each.

The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>; the cumulative viewership of all matches of the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 World Cup</a> was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">final match</a>, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.

17 countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany and Mexico have each hosted twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, Japan and South Korea (jointly), South Africa and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar are planned as hosts of the 2022 finals, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to have hosted games in three finals.

The world's first international football match was a challenge match played in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> in 1872 between <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a> and <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>, which ended in a 0–0 draw. The first international tournament, the inaugural <a href="British%20Home%20Championship">British Home Championship</a>, took place in 1884. As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a <a href="demonstration%20sport">demonstration sport</a> with no medals awarded at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201900%20Summer%20Olympics">1900</a> and <a href="Football%20at%20the%201904%20Summer%20Olympics">1904 Summer Olympics</a> (however, the IOC has retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201906%20Summer%20Olympics">1906 Intercalated Games</a>.

After <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a> was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906. These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure.

At the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201908%20Summer%20Olympics">1908 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, football became an official competition. Planned by <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> (FA), England's football governing body, the event was for <a href="amateurism">amateur</a> players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition. Great Britain (represented by the <a href="England%20national%20amateur%20football%20team">England national amateur football team</a>) won the <a href="gold%20medal">gold medal</a>s. They repeated the feat at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201912%20Summer%20Olympics">1912 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>.

With the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, <a href="Thomas%20Lipton">Sir Thomas Lipton</a> organised the <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Lipton%20Trophy">Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy</a> tournament in <a href="Turin">Turin</a> in 1909. The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation. The competition is sometimes described as "The First World Cup", and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team. Lipton invited <a href="West%20Auckland%20Town%20F.C.">West Auckland</a>, an amateur side from <a href="County%20Durham">County Durham</a>, to represent England instead. West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title.

In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the <a href="Football%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">Olympic tournament</a> as a "world football championship for amateurs", and took responsibility for managing the event. This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition, at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201920%20Summer%20Olympics">1920 Summer Olympics</a>, contested by <a href="Egypt%20national%20football%20team">Egypt</a> and 13 European teams, and won by <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a>. <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a> won the next two Olympic football tournaments in <a href="Football%20at%20the%201924%20Summer%20Olympics">1924</a> and <a href="Football%20at%20the%201928%20Summer%20Olympics">1928</a>. Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era.

Due to the success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20FIFA">President</a> <a href="Jules%20Rimet">Jules Rimet</a> as the driving force, again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics. On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> decided to stage a world championship itself. With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their <a href="centenary">centenary</a> of <a href="treaty%20of%20Montevideo%20%281828%29">independence</a> in 1930, FIFA named <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> as the host country of the <a href="1930%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">inaugural World Cup tournament</a>.

The national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a>, <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>, <a href="Romania%20national%20football%20team">Romania</a>, and <a href="Yugoslavia%20national%20football%20team">Yugoslavia</a> to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.
The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 July 1930, and were won by <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">USA</a>, who defeated <a href="Mexico%20national%20football%20team">Mexico</a> 4–1 and <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a> 3–0 respectively. The first goal in World Cup history was scored by <a href="Lucien%20Laurent">Lucien Laurent</a> of France. In the <a href="1930%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a>, <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a> defeated <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a> 4–2 in front of 93,000 people in <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a>, and became the first nation to win the World Cup. After the creation of the World Cup, FIFA and the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">IOC</a> disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the <a href="1932%20Summer%20Olympics">1932 Summer Olympics</a>. Olympic football returned at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Summer Olympics</a>, but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious World Cup.

The issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war. Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the <a href="1934%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1934 World Cup</a> and all North and South American nations except <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a> and <a href="Cuba%20national%20football%20team">Cuba</a> boycotted the <a href="1938%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1938</a> tournament. Brazil was the only South American team to compete in both. The 1942 and 1946 competitions, which <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> sought to host, were cancelled due to <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and its aftermath.

The <a href="1950%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1950 World Cup</a>, held in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, was the first to include British participants. <a href="Home%20Nations">British teams</a> withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football, but rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation. The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a>, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups. Uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation Brazil, in the match called "<a href="Uruguay%20v%20Brazil%20%281950%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%29">Maracanazo</a>" (Portuguese: "Maracanaço").

In the tournaments between 1934 and <a href="1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1978</a>, 16 teams competed in each tournament, except in 1938, when <a href="Austria%20national%20football%20team">Austria</a> was <a href="Anschluss">absorbed</a> into <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when <a href="India%20national%20football%20team">India</a>, <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a>, and <a href="Turkey%20national%20football%20team">Turkey</a> withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams. Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">USA</a>, semi-finalists in 1930; <a href="Cuba%20national%20football%20team">Cuba</a>, quarter-finalists in 1938; <a href="North%20Korea%20national%20football%20team">North Korea</a>, quarter-finalists in <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966</a>; and <a href="Mexico%20national%20football%20team">Mexico</a>, quarter-finalists in <a href="1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1970</a>.

The tournament was expanded to 24 teams in <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982</a>, and then to 32 in <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998</a>, also allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part. Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: <a href="Mexico%20national%20football%20team">Mexico</a>, quarter-finalists in <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986</a>; <a href="Cameroon%20national%20football%20team">Cameroon</a>, quarter-finalists in <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1990</a>; <a href="South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team">South Korea</a>, finishing in fourth place in <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002</a>; <a href="Senegal%20national%20football%20team">Senegal</a>, along with <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">USA</a>, both quarter-finalists in 2002; <a href="Ghana%20national%20football%20team">Ghana</a>, quarter-finalists in 2010; and <a href="Costa%20Rica%20national%20football%20team">Costa Rica</a>, quarter-finalists in 2014. Nevertheless, European and South American teams continue to dominate, e.g., the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2018 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far.

Two hundred teams entered the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a> qualification rounds; 198 nations attempted to qualify for the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a>, while a record 204 countries entered qualification for the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>.

In October 2013, Sepp Blatter spoke of guaranteeing the <a href="Caribbean%20Football%20Union">Caribbean Football Union</a>'s region a position in the World Cup. In the edition of 25 October 2013 of the "FIFA Weekly" Blatter wrote that: "From a purely sporting perspective, I would like to see globalisation finally taken seriously, and the African and Asian national associations accorded the status they deserve at the FIFA World Cup. It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup." Those two remarks suggested to commentators that Blatter could be putting himself forward for re-election to the FIFA Presidency.

Following the magazine's publication, Blatter's would-be opponent for the FIFA Presidency, <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> President <a href="Michel%20Platini">Michel Platini</a>, responded that he intended to extend the World Cup to 40 national associations, increasing the number of participants by eight. Platini said that he would allocate an additional berth to <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>, two to the <a href="Asian%20Football%20Confederation">Asian Football Confederation</a> and the <a href="Confederation%20of%20African%20Football">Confederation of African Football</a>, two shared between <a href="CONCACAF">CONCACAF</a> and <a href="CONMEBOL">CONMEBOL</a>, and a guaranteed place for the <a href="Oceania%20Football%20Confederation">Oceania Football Confederation</a>. Platini was clear about why he wanted to expand the World Cup. He said: "[The World Cup is] not based on the quality of the teams because you don't have the best 32 at the World Cup ... but it's a good compromise. ... It's a political matter so why not have more Africans? The competition is to bring all the people of all the world. If you don't give the possibility to participate, they don't improve."

In October 2016, FIFA president <a href="Gianni%20Infantino">Gianni Infantino</a> stated his support for a 48-team World Cup in 2026. On 10 January 2017, FIFA confirmed the 2026 World Cup will have 48 finalist teams.

By May 2015, the games were under a particularly dark cloud because of the 2015 FIFA corruption case, allegations and criminal charges of bribery, fraud and money laundering to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights (rigged bids) for FIFA games, with FIFA officials accused of taking bribes totaling more than $150 million over 24 years. In late May, the U.S. Justice Department announced a 47-count indictment with charges of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy against 14 people. Arrests of over a dozen FIFA officials were made since that time, particularly on 29 May and 3 December. By the end of May 2015, a total of nine FIFA officials and five executives of sports and broadcasting markets had already been charged on corruption. At the time, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced he would relinquish his position in February 2016.

On 4 June 2015 <a href="Chuck%20Blazer">Chuck Blazer</a> while co-operating with the <a href="FBI">FBI</a> and the Swiss authorities admitted that he and the other members of FIFA's then-executive committee were bribed in order to promote the 1998 and 2010 World Cups. On 10 June 2015 Swiss authorities seized computer data from the offices of <a href="Sepp%20Blatter">Sepp Blatter</a>. The same day, FIFA postponed the bidding process for the <a href="2026%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2026 FIFA World Cup</a> in light of the <a href="Garcia%20Report">allegations surrounding bribery</a> in the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. Then-secretary general <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Valcke">Jérôme Valcke</a> stated, "Due to the situation, I think it's nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being." On 28 October 2015, Blatter and FIFA VP Michel Platini, a potential candidate for presidency, were suspended for 90 days; both maintained their innocence in statements made to the news media.

On 3 December 2015 two FIFA vice-presidents were arrested on suspicion of bribery in the same Zurich hotel where seven FIFA officials had been arrested in May. An additional 16 indictments by the U.S. Department of Justice were announced on the same day.

An equivalent tournament for <a href="Women%27s%20association%20football">women's football</a>, the <a href="FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">FIFA Women's World Cup</a>, was first held in <a href="FIFA%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup%201991">1991</a> in <a href="China">China</a>. The women's tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the men's, but is growing; the number of entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120, more than double that of 1991.

Men's football has been included in every <a href="Summer%20Olympic%20Games">Summer Olympic Games</a> except 1896 and 1932. Unlike many other sports, the men's <a href="Football%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">football tournament at the Olympics</a> is not a top-level tournament, and since 1992, an under-23 tournament with each team allowed three over-age players. Women's football made its <a href="Football%20at%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20tournament">Olympic debut in 1996</a>.

The <a href="FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup">FIFA Confederations Cup</a> is a tournament held one year before the World Cup at the World Cup host nation(s) as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming World Cup. It is contested by the winners of each of the six FIFA confederation championships, along with the FIFA World Cup champion and the host country.

FIFA also organises international tournaments for youth football (<a href="FIFA%20U-20%20World%20Cup">FIFA U-20 World Cup</a>, <a href="FIFA%20U-17%20World%20Cup">FIFA U-17 World Cup</a>, <a href="FIFA%20U-20%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup</a>, <a href="FIFA%20U-17%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup</a>), club football (<a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>), and football variants such as <a href="futsal">futsal</a> (<a href="FIFA%20Futsal%20World%20Cup">FIFA Futsal World Cup</a>) and <a href="beach%20soccer">beach soccer</a> (<a href="FIFA%20Beach%20Soccer%20World%20Cup">FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup</a>). The latter three do not have a women's version, although a <a href="FIFA%20Women%27s%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Women's Club World Cup</a> has been proposed.

The <a href="FIFA%20U-20%20Women%27s%20World%20Cup">FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup</a> is held the year before each Women's World Cup and both tournaments are awarded in a single bidding process. The U-20 tournament serves as a dress rehearsal for the larger competition.

From 1930 to 1970, the "<a href="Jules%20Rimet%20Trophy">Jules Rimet Trophy</a>" was awarded to the World Cup winning team. It was originally simply known as the "World Cup" or "Coupe du Monde", but in 1946 it was renamed after the FIFA president <a href="Jules%20Rimet">Jules Rimet</a> who set up the first tournament. In <a href="1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1970</a>, <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a>'s third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently. However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.
After 1970, a new trophy, known as the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Trophy%23FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Trophy">FIFA World Cup Trophy</a>, was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven countries, evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work of the Italian designer <a href="Silvio%20Gazzaniga">Silvio Gazzaniga</a>. The new trophy is high, made of solid 18 <a href="carat%20%28purity%29">carat</a> (75%) gold and weighs . The base contains two layers of semi-precious <a href="malachite">malachite</a> while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974</a>. The description of the trophy by Gazzaniga was: "The lines spring out from the base, rising in spirals, stretching out to receive the world. From the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory."

This new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy only until the post-match celebration is finished. They are awarded a gold-plated replica rather than the solid gold original immediately afterwards.

Currently, all members (players, coaches, and managers) of the top three teams receive medals with an insignia of the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Trophy%23FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Trophy">World Cup Trophy</a>; winners' (gold), runners-up' (silver), and third-place (bronze). In the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 edition</a>, fourth-place medals were awarded to hosts <a href="South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team">South Korea</a>. Before the 1978 tournament, medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch at the end of the final and the third-place match. In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals.

Since the second World Cup in <a href="1934%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1934</a>, qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament. They are held within the six FIFA continental zones (<a href="Confederation%20of%20African%20Football">Africa</a>, <a href="Asian%20Football%20Confederation">Asia</a>, <a href="CONCACAF">North and Central America and Caribbean</a>, <a href="CONMEBOL">South America</a>, <a href="Oceania%20Football%20Confederation">Oceania</a>, and <a href="UEFA">Europe</a>), overseen by their respective confederations. For each tournament, FIFA decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand, generally based on the relative strength of the confederations' teams.

The qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a two-year period. The formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations. Usually, one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental <a href="play-off">play-off</a>s. For example, the winner of the Oceanian zone and the fifth-placed team from the Asian zone entered a play-off for a spot in the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 World Cup</a>. From the <a href="1938%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1938 World Cup</a> onwards, host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament. This right was also granted to the defending champions between 1938 and 2002, but was withdrawn from the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a> onward, requiring the champions to qualify. <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a>, winners in <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002</a>, were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches.

The current final tournament has been used since 1998 and features 32 national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: the group stage followed by the knockout stage.

In the group stage, teams compete within eight groups of four teams each. Eight teams are seeded, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Rankings">FIFA World Rankings</a> and/or performances in recent World Cups, and drawn to separate groups. The other teams are assigned to different "pots", usually based on geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Since <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998</a>, constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two European teams or more than one team from any other confederation.

Each group plays a <a href="round-robin%20tournament">round-robin tournament</a>, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. This means that a total of six matches are played within a group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1994</a>, <a href="Three%20points%20for%20a%20win">three points have been awarded for a win</a>, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).

If one considers all possible outcomes (win, draw, loss) for all six matches in a group, there are 729 (= 3) outcome combinations possible. However, 207 of these combinations lead to ties between the second and third places. In such case, the ranking among these teams is determined as follows:

The knockout stage is a <a href="single-elimination%20tournament">single-elimination tournament</a> in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a> and <a href="penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalty shootouts</a> used to decide the winner if necessary. It begins with the round of 16 (or the second round) in which the winner of each group plays against the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the <a href="third%20place%20playoff">third-place match</a> (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.

On 10 January 2017, FIFA approved a new format, the 48-team World Cup (to accommodate more teams), which consists of 16 groups of three teams each, with two teams qualifying from each group, to form a round of 32 knockout stage, to be implemented by 2026.

Early World Cups were given to countries at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the <a href="1930%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">first World Cup</a> in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the <a href="1938%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1938 FIFA World Cup</a>.

Since the <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1958 FIFA World Cup</a>, to avoid future boycotts or controversy, FIFA began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the Americas and Europe, which continued until the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998 FIFA World Cup</a>. The <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a>, hosted jointly by South Korea and Japan, was the first one held in Asia, and the first tournament with multiple hosts. South Africa became the first African nation to host the World Cup in <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010</a>. The <a href="2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2014 FIFA World Cup</a> was hosted by Brazil, the first held in South America since <a href="1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">Argentina 1978</a>, and was the first occasion where consecutive World Cups were held outside Europe.

The host country is now chosen in a vote by FIFA's Council. This is done under an <a href="exhaustive%20ballot">exhaustive ballot</a> system. The national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a "Hosting Agreement" from FIFA, which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid. The bidding association also receives a form, the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy. After this, a FIFA designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced. The decision on who will host the World Cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament. However, there have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time, as was the case for the <a href="2018%20and%202022%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20bids">2018 and 2022 World Cups</a>, which were awarded to <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="Qatar">Qatar</a>, with Qatar becoming the first Middle Eastern country to host the tournament.

For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the final tournament is rotated between confederations, allowing only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid to host the tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%20hosts%232006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">controversy</a> surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 tournament</a>. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018</a>. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.

The <a href="2026%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2026 FIFA World Cup</a> was chosen to be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico, marking the first time a World Cup has been shared by three host nations. The 2026 tournament will be the biggest World Cup ever held, with 48 teams playing 80 matches. Sixty matches will take place in the US, including all matches from the quarter-finals onward, while Canada and Mexico will host 10 games each.

Six of the eight champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland, the exceptions being <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a>, who finished as runners-up after losing the <a href="Uruguay%20v%20Brazil%20%281950%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%29">deciding match</a> on home soil in 1950 and lost their semi-final against Germany in 2014, and <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a>, which reached the second round on home soil in 1982. <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> (1966) won its only title while playing as a host nation. <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a> (1930), <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> (1934), <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a> (1978) and 
<a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> (1998) won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again, while <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a> (1974) won their second title on home soil.

Other nations have also been successful when hosting the tournament. <a href="Switzerland%20national%20football%20team">Switzerland</a> (quarter-finals 1954), <a href="Sweden%20national%20football%20team">Sweden</a> (runners-up in 1958), <a href="Chile%20national%20football%20team">Chile</a> (third place in 1962), <a href="South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team">South Korea</a> (fourth place in 2002), and <a href="Mexico%20national%20football%20team">Mexico</a> (quarter-finals in 1970 and 1986) all have their best results when serving as hosts. So far, <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20football%20team">South Africa</a> (2010) has been the only host nation to fail to advance beyond the first round.

 The best-attended single match, shown in the last three columns, has been the final in half of the 20 World Cups . Another match or matches drew more attendance than the final in 1930, 1938, 1958, 1962, 1970–1982, 1990 and 2006.


The World Cup was first televised in 1954 and is now the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup is estimated to be 26.29 billion. 715.1 million individuals watched the final match of this tournament (a ninth of the entire population of the planet). The 2006 World Cup draw, which decided the distribution of teams into groups, was watched by 300 million viewers. The World Cup attracts many sponsors such as <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>, <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> and <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>. For these companies and many more, being a sponsor strongly impacts their global brands. Host countries typically experience a multimillion-dollar revenue increase from the month-long event.
The governing body of the sport, <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>, generated $4.8 billion in revenue from the 2014 tournament.

Each FIFA World Cup since 1966 has its own <a href="mascot">mascot</a> or logo. "World Cup Willie", the mascot for the 1966 competition, was the first <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%20mascots">World Cup mascot</a>. World Cups feature <a href="List%20of%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20official%20match%20balls">official match balls</a> specially designed for each tournament. Each World Cup also has an <a href="List%20of%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20anthems%20and%20songs">official song</a>, which have been performed by artists ranging from <a href="Shakira">Shakira</a> to <a href="Will%20Smith">Will Smith</a>. Other songs, such as “<a href="Nessun%20dorma">Nessun dorma</a>”, performed by <a href="The%20Three%20Tenors">The Three Tenors</a> at four World Cup concerts, have also become identified with the tournament.

Forming a partnership with FIFA in 1970, <a href="Panini%20Group">Panini</a> published its first <a href="sticker%20album">sticker album</a> for the 1970 World Cup. Since then, collecting and trading stickers has become part of the World Cup experience, especially for the younger generation. FIFA has also licensed World Cup <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%20video%20games">video games</a> since 1986, with <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> the current license holder.

The World Cup even has a statistically significant effect on birth rates, the male/female sex ratio of newborns, and heart attacks in nations whose national teams are competing.

In all, 79 nations have <a href="National%20team%20appearances%20in%20the%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">played in at least one World Cup</a>. Of these, eight national teams have won the World Cup, and they have added <a href="Star%20%28football%20badge%29">stars to their badges</a>, with each star representing a World Cup victory. (Uruguay, however, choose to display four stars on their badge, representing their two gold medals at the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics and their two World Cup titles in 1930 and 1950).

With five titles, Brazil are the most successful World Cup team and also the only nation to have <a href="National%20team%20appearances%20in%20the%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%23Ranking%20of%20teams%20by%20number%20of%20appearances">played in every World Cup</a> (21) to date. Brazil were also the first team to win the World Cup for the third (1970), fourth (1994) and fifth (2002) time. Italy (1934 and 1938) and Brazil (1958 and 1962) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles. West Germany (1982–1990) and Brazil (1994–2002) are the only nations to appear in three consecutive World Cup finals. Germany has made the most top-four finishes (13), medals (12), as well as the most finals (8).

To date, the final of the World Cup has only been contested by teams from the <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a> (Europe) and <a href="CONMEBOL">CONMEBOL</a> (South America) confederations. European nations have won twelve titles, while South American have won nine. Only two teams from outside these two continents have ever reached the semi-finals of the competition: <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">United States</a> (<a href="CONCACAF">North, Central America and Caribbean</a>) in 1930 and <a href="South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team">South Korea</a> (<a href="Asian%20Football%20Confederation">Asia</a>) in 2002. The best result of an <a href="Confederation%20of%20African%20Football">African</a> team is reaching the quarter-finals: <a href="Cameroon%20national%20football%20team">Cameroon</a> in 1990, <a href="Senegal%20national%20football%20team">Senegal</a> in 2002 and <a href="Ghana%20national%20football%20team">Ghana</a> in 2010. Only one <a href="Oceania%20Football%20Confederation">Oceanian</a> qualifier, <a href="Australia%20national%20soccer%20team">Australia</a> in 2006, has advanced to the second round.

<a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a>, <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a>, <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a> and <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a> are the only teams to win a World Cup outside their continental confederation; Brazil came out victorious in <a href="UEFA">Europe</a> (<a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1958</a>), <a href="CONCACAF">North America</a> (<a href="1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1970</a> and <a href="1994%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1994</a>) and <a href="Asian%20Football%20Confederation">Asia</a> (<a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002</a>). Argentina won a World Cup in North America in <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1986</a>, while Spain won in <a href="Confederation%20of%20African%20Football">Africa</a> in <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010</a>. In <a href="2014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2014</a>, Germany became the first European team to win in the Americas. Only on five occasions have consecutive World Cups been won by teams from the same continent, and currently it is the first time with four champions in a row from the same continental confederation. Italy and Brazil successfully defended their titles in 1938 and 1962 respectively, while Italy's triumph in 2006 has been followed by wins for Spain in 2010, Germany in 2014 and France in 2018. Currently, it is also the first time that one of the currently winning continents (Europe) is ahead of the other (South America) by more than one championship.

At the end of each World Cup, awards are presented to the players and teams for accomplishments other than their final team positions in the tournament. There are currently six awards:
An "<a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup%20awards%23All-Star%20Team">All-Star Team</a>" consisting of the best players of the tournament has also been announced for each tournament since 1998.

Three players share the record for <a href="List%20of%20players%20who%20have%20appeared%20in%20multiple%20FIFA%20World%20Cups">playing in the most World Cups</a>; <a href="Mexico%20national%20football%20team">Mexico</a>'s <a href="Antonio%20Carbajal">Antonio Carbajal</a> (1950–1966) and <a href="Rafael%20M%C3%A1rquez">Rafael Márquez</a> (2002–2018); and <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">Germany</a>'s <a href="Lothar%20Matth%C3%A4us">Lothar Matthäus</a> (1982–1998) all played in five tournaments.

<a href="Miroslav%20Klose">Miroslav Klose</a> of Germany (2002–2014) is the all-time top scorer at the finals, with 16 goals. He broke <a href="Ronaldo%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29">Ronaldo</a> of Brazil's record of 15 goals (1998–2006) during the <a href="Brazil%20v%20Germany%20%282014%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%29">2014 semi-final match against Brazil</a>. West Germany's <a href="Gerd%20M%C3%BCller">Gerd Müller</a> (1970–1974) is third, with 14 goals. The fourth placed goalscorer, <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>'s <a href="Just%20Fontaine">Just Fontaine</a>, holds the record for the most goals scored in a single World Cup; all his 13 goals were scored in the 1958 tournament.

In November 2007, FIFA announced that all members of World Cup-winning squads between 1930 and 1974 were to be retroactively awarded winners' medals. This made Brazil's <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a> the only player to have won three World Cup winners' medals (1958, 1962, and 1970, although he did not play in the 1962 final due to injury), with <a href="List%20of%20players%20who%20have%20won%20multiple%20FIFA%20World%20Cups">20 other players who have won two winners' medals</a>. Seven players have collected all three types of World Cup medals (winners', runner- ups', and third-place); five players were from <a href="Germany%20national%20football%20team">West Germany</a>'s squad of 1966–1974 including <a href="Franz%20Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a>, <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20Grabowski">Jürgen Grabowski</a>, <a href="Horst-Dieter%20H%C3%B6ttges">Horst-Dieter Höttges</a>, <a href="Sepp%20Maier">Sepp Maier</a> and <a href="Wolfgang%20Overath">Wolfgang Overath</a> (1966–1974), Italy's <a href="Franco%20Baresi">Franco Baresi</a> (1982, 1990, 1994) and the most recent has been <a href="Miroslav%20Klose">Miroslav Klose</a> of Germany (2002–2014) with four consecutive medals.

Brazil's <a href="M%C3%A1rio%20Zagallo">Mário Zagallo</a>, West Germany's <a href="Franz%20Beckenbauer">Franz Beckenbauer</a> and France's <a href="Didier%20Deschamps">Didier Deschamps</a> are the only people to date to win the World Cup as both player and head coach. Zagallo won in 1958 and 1962 as a player and in 1970 as head coach. Beckenbauer won in 1974 as captain and in 1990 as head coach, and Deschamps repeated the feat in 2018, after having won in 1998 as captain. <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a>'s <a href="Vittorio%20Pozzo">Vittorio Pozzo</a> is the only head coach to ever win two World Cups (1934 and 1938).

Female genital mutilation

Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the <a href="external%20female%20genitalia">external female genitalia</a>. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, <a href="Iraqi%20Kurdistan">Iraqi Kurdistan</a> and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.

Typically carried out by a traditional circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut before the age of five. Procedures differ according to the country or <a href="ethnic%20group">ethnic group</a>. They include removal of the <a href="clitoral%20hood">clitoral hood</a> and <a href="clitoral%20glans">clitoral glans</a>; removal of the <a href="Labia%20minora">inner labia</a>; and removal of the inner and <a href="Labia%20majora">outer labia</a> and closure of the <a href="vulva">vulva</a>. In this last procedure, known as <a href="%23Type%20III">infibulation</a>, a small hole is left for the passage of urine and <a href="Menstruation">menstrual fluid</a>; the <a href="vagina">vagina</a> is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.

The practice is rooted in <a href="gender%20inequality">gender inequality</a>, attempts to control <a href="human%20female%20sexuality">women's sexuality</a>, and ideas about purity, modesty and beauty. It is usually initiated and carried out by women, who see it as a source of honour and fear that failing to have their daughters and granddaughters cut will expose the girls to <a href="social%20exclusion">social exclusion</a>. Adverse health effects depend on the type of procedure; they can include recurrent infections, difficulty urinating and passing menstrual flow, <a href="chronic%20pain">chronic pain</a>, the development of <a href="cyst">cyst</a>s, an inability to get pregnant, complications during childbirth, and fatal bleeding. There are no known health benefits.

There have been international efforts since the 1970s to persuade practitioners to abandon FGM, and it has been outlawed or restricted in most of the countries in which it occurs, although the laws are poorly enforced. Since 2010 the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> has called upon healthcare providers to stop performing all forms of the procedure, including <a href="%23reinfibulation">reinfibulation</a> after childbirth and symbolic "nicking" of the clitoral hood. The opposition to the practice is not without its critics, particularly among <a href="Anthropology">anthropologists</a>, who have raised difficult questions about <a href="cultural%20relativism">cultural relativism</a> and the universality of <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a>.

Until the 1980s FGM was widely known in English as female circumcision, implying an equivalence in severity with <a href="male%20circumcision">male circumcision</a>. From 1929 the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Churches%20of%20Kenya">Kenya Missionary Council</a> referred to it as the sexual mutilation of women, following the lead of <a href="Marion%20Stevenson">Marion Scott Stevenson</a>, a <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> missionary. References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s. In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term "female genital mutilation" in the title of a paper in "American Ethnologist", and four years later <a href="Fran%20Hosken">Fran Hosken</a>, an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential "The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females". The <a href="Inter-African%20Committee%20on%20Traditional%20Practices%20Affecting%20the%20Health%20of%20Women%20and%20Children">Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children</a> began referring to it as female genital mutilation in 1990, and the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) followed suit in 1991. Other English terms include "female genital cutting" (FGC) and "female genital mutilation/cutting" (FGM/C), preferred by those who work with practitioners.

In countries where FGM is common, the practice's many variants are reflected in dozens of terms, often alluding to purification. In the <a href="Bambara%20language">Bambara language</a>, spoken mostly in Mali, it is known as "bolokoli" ("washing your hands") and in the <a href="Igbo%20language">Igbo language</a> in eastern Nigeria as "isa aru" or "iwu aru" ("having your bath"). Other terms include "khifad", "tahoor", "quodiin, irua, bondo, kuruna, negekorsigin", and "kene-kene". A common <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> term for purification has the root "t-h-r", used for male and female circumcision ("tahur" and "tahara"). It is also known in Arabic as "khafḍ" or "khifaḍ". Communities may refer to FGM as "pharaonic" for <a href="infibulation">infibulation</a> and "<a href="Sunnah">sunna</a>" circumcision for everything else. "Sunna" means "path or way" in Arabic and refers to the tradition of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, although none of the procedures are required within Islam. The term "infibulation" derives from <a href="Fibula%20%28brooch%29">"fibula"</a>, Latin for clasp; the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Ancient Romans</a> reportedly fastened clasps through the foreskins or labia of slaves to prevent sexual intercourse. The surgical infibulation of women came to be known as pharaonic circumcision in Sudan, and as Sudanese circumcision in Egypt. In Somalia it is known simply as "qodob" ("to sew up").

The procedures are generally performed by a traditional circumciser (cutter or "exciseuse") in the girls' homes, with or without anaesthesia. The cutter is usually an older woman, but in communities where the male <a href="Barber%23History">barber</a> has assumed the role of health worker he will also perform FGM. When traditional cutters are involved, non-sterile devices are likely to be used, including knives, razors, scissors, glass, sharpened rocks and fingernails. According to a nurse in Uganda, quoted in 2007 in "The Lancet", a cutter would use one knife on up to 30 girls at a time. Health professionals are often involved in Egypt, Kenya, Indonesia and Sudan; in Egypt 77 percent of FGM procedures, and in Indonesia over 50 percent, were performed by medical professionals as of 2008 and 2016. Women in Egypt reported in 1995 that a <a href="local%20anaesthetic">local anaesthetic</a> had been used on their daughters in 60 percent of cases, a <a href="general%20anaesthetic">general anaesthetic</a> in 13 percent, and neither in 25 percent (two percent were missing/don't know).

The WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA issued a joint statement in 1997 defining FGM as "all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons". The procedures vary considerably according to ethnicity and individual practitioners. During a 1998 survey in Niger, women responded with over 50 different terms when asked what was done to them. Translation problems are compounded by the women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it. Several studies have suggested that survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, a significant percentage of infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.

<a href="%23Household%20surveys">Standard questionnaires</a> from United Nations bodies ask women whether they or their daughters have undergone the following: (1) cut, no flesh removed (symbolic nicking); (2) cut, some flesh removed; (3) sewn closed; or (4) type not determined/unsure/doesn't know. The most common procedures fall within the "cut, some flesh removed" category and involve complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans. The World Health Organization (a UN agency) created a more detailed typology: Types I–III vary in how much tissue is removed; Type III is equivalent to the UNICEF category "sewn closed"; and Type IV describes miscellaneous procedures, including symbolic nicking.
Type I is "partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce". Type Ia involves removal of the <a href="clitoral%20hood">clitoral hood</a> only. This is rarely performed alone. The more common procedure is Type Ib (<a href="clitoridectomy">clitoridectomy</a>), the complete or partial removal of the <a href="clitoral%20glans">clitoral glans</a> (the visible tip of the clitoris) and clitoral hood. The circumciser pulls the clitoral glans with her thumb and index finger and cuts it off.

Type II (excision) is the complete or partial removal of the <a href="Labia%20minora">inner labia</a>, with or without removal of the clitoral glans and <a href="Labia%20majora">outer labia</a>. Type IIa is removal of the inner labia; Type IIb, removal of the clitoral glans and inner labia; and Type IIc, removal of the clitoral glans, inner and outer labia. "Excision" in French can refer to any form of FGM.

Type III (<a href="infibulation">infibulation</a> or pharaonic circumcision), the "sewn closed" category, involves the removal of the external genitalia and fusion of the wound. The inner and/or outer labia are cut away, with or without removal of the clitoral glans. Type III is found largely in northeast Africa, particularly Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan (although not in South Sudan). According to one 2008 estimate, over eight million women in Africa are living with Type III FGM. According to UNFPA in 2010, 20 percent of women with FGM have been infibulated. In Somalia "[t]he child is made to squat on a stool or mat facing the circumciser at a height that offers her a good view of the parts to be handled. ... adult helpers grab and pull apart the legs of the girl. ... If available, this is the stage at which a local anaesthetic would be used":

The element of speed and surprise is vital and the circumciser immediately grabs the clitoris by pinching it between her nails aiming to amputate it with a slash. The organ is then shown to the senior female relatives of the child who will decide whether the amount that has been removed is satisfactory or whether more is to be cut off.

After the clitoris has been satisfactorily amputated ... the circumciser can proceed with the total removal of the labia minora and the paring of the inner walls of the labia majora. Since the entire skin on the inner walls of the labia majora has to be removed all the way down to the perineum, this becomes a messy business. By now, the child is screaming, struggling, and bleeding profusely, which makes it difficult for the circumciser to hold with bare fingers and nails the slippery skin and parts that are to be cut or sutured together. ...

Having ensured that sufficient tissue has been removed to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the opposite sides of the labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.
The amputated parts might be placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3 mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with surgical thread, or <a href="agave">agave</a> or <a href="acacia">acacia</a> thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too large in the view of the girl's family, the procedure is repeated.

The vagina is opened for sexual intercourse, for the first time either by a midwife with a knife or by the woman's husband with his penis. In some areas, including Somaliland, female relatives of the bride and groom might watch the opening of the vagina to check that the girl is a virgin. The woman is opened further for childbirth ("defibulation" or "deinfibulation"), and closed again afterwards ("reinfibulation"). Reinfibulation can involve cutting the vagina again to restore the pinhole size of the first infibulation. This might be performed before marriage, and after childbirth, divorce and widowhood. Hanny Lightfoot-Klein interviewed hundreds of women and men in Sudan in the 1980s about sexual intercourse with Type III:

The penetration of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some who are unable to penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place. ... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, with the help of the "little knife". This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.

Type IV is "[a]ll other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes", including pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization. It includes nicking of the clitoris (symbolic circumcision), burning or scarring the genitals, and introducing substances into the vagina to tighten it. <a href="Labia%20stretching">Labia stretching</a> is also categorized as Type IV. Common in southern and eastern Africa, the practice is supposed to enhance sexual pleasure for the man and add to the sense of a woman as a closed space. From the age of eight, girls are encouraged to stretch their inner labia using sticks and massage. Girls in Uganda are told they may have difficulty giving birth without stretched labia.

A definition of FGM from the WHO in 1995 included <a href="gishiri%20cutting">gishiri cutting</a> and angurya cutting, found in Nigeria and Niger. These were removed from the WHO's 2008 definition because of insufficient information about prevalence and consequences. Angurya cutting is excision of the <a href="hymen">hymen</a>, usually performed seven days after birth. Gishiri cutting involves cutting the vagina's front or back wall with a blade or penknife, performed in response to infertility, obstructed labour and other conditions. In a study by Nigerian physician Mairo Usman Mandara, over 30 percent of women with gishiri cuts were found to have <a href="vesicovaginal%20fistula">vesicovaginal fistula</a>e (holes that allow urine to seep into the vagina).

FGM harms women's physical and emotional health throughout their lives. It has no known health benefits. The short-term and late <a href="complication%20%28medicine%29">complications</a> depend on the type of FGM, whether the practitioner has had medical training, and whether they used antibiotics and sterilized or single-use surgical instruments. In the case of Type III, other factors include how small a hole was left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, whether surgical thread was used instead of agave or acacia thorns, and whether the procedure was performed more than once (for example, to close an opening regarded as too wide or re-open one too small).
Common short-term complications include swelling, excessive bleeding, pain, <a href="Urinary%20retention">urine retention</a>, and healing problems/<a href="wound%20infection">wound infection</a>. A 2014 systematic review of 56 studies suggested that over one in ten girls and women undergoing any form of FGM, including symbolic nicking of the clitoris (Type IV), experience immediate complications, although the risks increased with Type III. The review also suggested that there was under-reporting. Other short-term complications include fatal bleeding, <a href="anaemia">anaemia</a>, <a href="urinary%20infection">urinary infection</a>, <a href="septicaemia">septicaemia</a>, <a href="tetanus">tetanus</a>, <a href="gangrene">gangrene</a>, <a href="necrotizing%20fasciitis">necrotizing fasciitis</a> (flesh-eating disease), and <a href="endometritis">endometritis</a>. It is not known how many girls and women die as a result of the practice, because complications may not be recognized or reported. The practitioners' use of shared instruments is thought to aid the transmission of <a href="hepatitis%20B">hepatitis B</a>, <a href="hepatitis%20C">hepatitis C</a> and <a href="HIV">HIV</a>, although no epidemiological studies have shown this.

Late complications vary depending on the type of FGM. They include the formation of scars and <a href="keloid">keloid</a>s that lead to <a href="Stenosis">strictures</a> and obstruction, <a href="epidermoid%20cyst">epidermoid cyst</a>s that may become infected, and <a href="neuroma">neuroma</a> formation (growth of nerve tissue) involving nerves that supplied the clitoris. An infibulated girl may be left with an opening as small as 2–3 mm, which can cause prolonged, drop-by-drop <a href="urination">urination</a>, <a href="dysuria">pain while urinating</a>, and a feeling of needing to urinate all the time. Urine may collect underneath the scar, leaving the area under the skin constantly wet, which can lead to infection and the formation of small stones. The opening is larger in women who are sexually active or have given birth by vaginal delivery, but the <a href="urethra">urethra</a> opening may still be obstructed by scar tissue. <a href="Vesicovaginal%20fistula">Vesicovaginal</a> or <a href="rectovaginal%20fistula">rectovaginal fistula</a>e can develop (holes that allow urine or faeces to seep into the vagina). This and other damage to the urethra and bladder can lead to infections and incontinence, <a href="dyspareunia">pain during sexual intercourse</a> and <a href="infertility">infertility</a>. <a href="Dysmenorrhea">Painful periods</a> are common because of the obstruction to the <a href="Menstruation">menstrual flow</a>, and blood can stagnate in the vagina and uterus. Complete obstruction of the vagina can result in <a href="hematocolpos">hematocolpos</a> and <a href="hematometra">hematometra</a> (where the vagina and uterus fill with menstrual blood). The swelling of the abdomen that results from the collection of fluid, together with the lack of menstruation, can lead to suspicion of pregnancy; Asma El Dareer, a Sudanese physician, reported in 1979 that a girl in Sudan with this condition was killed by her family.

FGM may place women at higher risk of problems during pregnancy and childbirth, which are more common with the more extensive FGM procedures. Infibulated women may try to make childbirth easier by eating less during pregnancy to reduce the baby's size. In women with vesicovaginal or rectovaginal fistulae, it is difficult to obtain clear urine samples as part of prenatal care, making the diagnosis of conditions such as <a href="pre-eclampsia">pre-eclampsia</a> harder. Cervical evaluation during labour may be impeded and labour prolonged or obstructed. Third-degree <a href="laceration">laceration</a> (tears), <a href="Human%20anus">anal-sphincter</a> damage and emergency <a href="caesarean%20section">caesarean section</a> are more common in infibulated women.

<a href="Perinatal%20mortality%23Neonatal%20mortality">Neonatal mortality</a> is increased. The WHO estimated in 2006 that an additional 10–20 babies die per 1,000 deliveries as a result of FGM. The estimate was based on a study conducted on 28,393 women attending delivery wards at 28 obstetric centres in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan. In those settings all types of FGM were found to pose an increased risk of death to the baby: 15 percent higher for Type I, 32 percent for Type II, and 55 percent for Type III. The reasons for this were unclear, but may be connected to genital and <a href="urinary%20tract%20infection">urinary tract infection</a>s and the presence of scar tissue. According to the study, FGM was associated with an increased risk to the mother of damage to the <a href="perineum">perineum</a> and <a href="postpartum%20bleeding">excessive blood loss</a>, as well as a need to <a href="Cardiopulmonary%20resuscitation">resuscitate</a> the baby, and <a href="stillbirth">stillbirth</a>, perhaps because of a long .

According to a 2015 <a href="systematic%20review">systematic review</a> there is little high-quality information available on the psychological effects of FGM. Several small studies have concluded that women with FGM suffer from anxiety, depression and <a href="post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>. Feelings of shame and betrayal can develop when women leave the culture that practises FGM and learn that their condition is not the norm, but within the practising culture they may view their FGM with pride, because for them it signifies beauty, respect for tradition, chastity and hygiene. Studies on sexual function have also been small. A 2013 <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> of 15 studies involving 12,671 women from seven countries concluded that women with FGM were twice as likely to report no sexual desire and 52 percent more likely to report <a href="dyspareunia">dyspareunia</a> (painful sexual intercourse). One third reported reduced sexual feelings.

Aid agencies define the prevalence of FGM as the percentage of the 15–49 age group that has experienced it. These figures are based on nationally representative household surveys known as <a href="Demographic%20and%20Health%20Surveys">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> (DHS), developed by <a href="ICF%20International">Macro International</a> and funded mainly by the <a href="United%20States%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development">United States Agency for International Development</a> (USAID); and <a href="Multiple%20Indicator%20Cluster%20Surveys">Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys</a> (MICS) conducted with financial and technical help from UNICEF. These surveys have been carried out in Africa, Asia, Latin America and elsewhere roughly every five years, since 1984 and 1995 respectively. The first to ask about FGM was the 1989–1990 DHS in northern Sudan. The first publication to estimate FGM prevalence based on DHS data (in seven countries) was written by Dara Carr of Macro International in 1997.

Questions the women are asked during the surveys include: "Was the genital area just nicked/cut without removing any flesh? Was any flesh (or something) removed from the genital area? Was your genital area sewn?" Most women report "cut, some flesh removed" (Types I and II).

Type I is the most common form in Egypt, and in the southern parts of Nigeria. Type III (infibulation) is concentrated in northeastern Africa, particularly Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan. In surveys in 2002–2006, 30 percent of cut girls in Djibouti, 38 percent in Eritrea, and 63 percent in Somalia had experienced Type III. There is also a high prevalence of infibulation among girls in Niger and Senegal, and in 2013 it was estimated that in Nigeria three percent of the 0–14 age group had been infibulated. The type of procedure is often linked to ethnicity. In Eritrea, for example, a survey in 2002 found that all <a href="Hedareb%20people">Hedareb</a> girls had been infibulated, compared with two percent of the <a href="Tigray-Tigrinya%20people">Tigrinya</a>, most of whom fell into the "cut, no flesh removed" category.

FGM is mostly found in what <a href="Gerry%20Mackie">Gerry Mackie</a> called an "intriguingly contiguous" zone in Africa—east to west from Somalia to Senegal, and north to south from Egypt to Tanzania. Nationally representative figures are available for 27 countries in Africa, as well as Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen. Over 200 million women and girls are thought to be living with FGM in those 30 countries.

The highest concentrations among the 15–49 age group are in Somalia (98 percent), Guinea (97 percent), Djibouti (93 percent), Egypt (91 percent) and Sierra Leone (90 percent). As of 2013, 27.2 million women had undergone FGM in Egypt, 23.8 million in Ethiopia, and 19.9 million in Nigeria. There is a high concentration in Indonesia, where according to UNICEF Type I (clitoridectomy) and Type IV (symbolic nicking) are practised; the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Health%20%28Indonesia%29">Indonesian Ministry of Health</a> and <a href="Indonesian%20Ulema%20Council">Indonesian Ulema Council</a> both say the clitoris should not be cut. The prevalence rate for the 0–11 group in Indonesia is 49 percent (13.4 million). Smaller studies or anecdotal reports suggest that FGM is also practised in Colombia, Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia and parts of Malaysia; in the United Arab Emirates; and in India by the <a href="Dawoodi%20Bohra">Dawoodi Bohra</a>. It is found within immigrant communities around the world.

Prevalence figures for the 15–19 age group and younger show a downward trend. For example, Burkina Faso fell from 89 percent (1980) to 58 percent (2010); Egypt from 97 percent (1985) to 70 percent (2015); and Kenya from 41 percent (1984) to 11 percent (2014). Beginning in 2010, household surveys asked women about the FGM status of all their living daughters. The highest concentrations among girls aged 0–14 were in Gambia (56 percent), Mauritania (54 percent), Indonesia (49 percent for 0–11) and Guinea (46 percent). The figures suggest that a girl was one third less likely in 2014 to undergo FGM than she was 30 years ago. According to a 2018 study published in "BMJ Global Health", the prevalence within the 0–14 year old group fell in East Africa from 71.4 percent in 1995 to 8 percent in 2016; in North Africa from 57.7 percent in 1990 to 14.1 percent in 2015; and in West Africa from 73.6 percent in 1996 to 25.4 percent in 2017. If the current rate of decline continues, the number of girls cut will nevertheless continue to rise because of population growth, according to UNICEF in 2014; they estimate that the figure will increase from 3.6 million a year in 2013 to 4.1 million in 2050.

Surveys have found FGM to be more common in rural areas, less common in most countries among girls from the wealthiest homes, and (except in Sudan and Somalia) less common in girls whose mothers had access to primary or secondary/higher education. In Somalia and Sudan the situation was reversed: in Somalia the mothers' access to secondary/higher education was accompanied by a rise in prevalence of FGM in their daughters, and in Sudan access to any education was accompanied by a rise.

FGM is not invariably a <a href="rite%20of%20passage">rite of passage</a> between childhood and adulthood, but is often performed on much younger children. Girls are most commonly cut shortly after birth to age 15. In half the countries for which national figures were available in 2000–2010, most girls had been cut by age five. Over 80 percent (of those cut) are cut before the age of five in Nigeria, Mali, Eritrea, Ghana and Mauritania. The 1997 Demographic and Health Survey in Yemen found that 76 percent of girls had been cut within two weeks of birth. The percentage is reversed in Somalia, Egypt, Chad and the Central African Republic, where over 80 percent (of those cut) are cut between five and 14. Just as the type of FGM is often linked to ethnicity, so is the mean age. In Kenya, for example, the <a href="Kisi%20people">Kisi</a> cut around age 10 and the <a href="Kamba%20people">Kamba</a> at 16.

A country's national prevalence often reflects a high sub-national prevalence among certain ethnicities, rather than a widespread practice. In Iraq, for example, FGM is found mostly among the <a href="Kurdish%20people">Kurds</a> in <a href="Erbil">Erbil</a> (58 percent prevalence within age group 15–49, as of 2011), <a href="Sulaymaniyah">Sulaymaniyah</a> (54 percent) and <a href="Kirkuk">Kirkuk</a> (20 percent), giving the country a national prevalence of eight percent. The practice is sometimes an ethnic marker, but it may differ along national lines. For example, in the northeastern regions of Ethiopia and Kenya, which share a border with Somalia, the <a href="Somali%20people">Somali people</a> practise FGM at around the same rate as they do in Somalia. But in Guinea all <a href="Fula%20people">Fulani</a> women responding to a survey in 2012 said they had experienced FGM, against 12 percent of the Fulani in Chad, while in Nigeria the Fulani are the only large ethnic group in the country not to practise it.

Dahabo Musa, a Somali woman, described infibulation in a 1988 poem as the "three feminine sorrows": the procedure itself, the wedding night when the woman is cut open, then childbirth when she is cut again. Despite the evident suffering, it is women who organize all forms of FGM. Anthropologist Rose Oldfield Hayes wrote in 1975 that educated Sudanese men who did not want their daughters to be infibulated (preferring clitoridectomy) would find the girls had been sewn up after the grandmothers arranged a visit to relatives. <a href="Gerry%20Mackie">Gerry Mackie</a> has compared the practice to <a href="footbinding">footbinding</a>. Like FGM, footbinding was carried out on young girls, nearly universal where practised, tied to ideas about honour, chastity and appropriate marriage, and "supported and transmitted" by women.
FGM practitioners see the procedures as marking not only ethnic boundaries but also gender difference. According to this view, male circumcision defeminizes men while FGM demasculinizes women. <a href="Fuambai%20Ahmadu">Fuambai Ahmadu</a>, an anthropologist and member of the <a href="Kono%20people">Kono people</a> of Sierra Leone, who in 1992 underwent clitoridectomy as an adult during a <a href="Sande%20society">Sande society</a> initiation, argued in 2000 that it is a male-centred assumption that the clitoris is important to female sexuality. African female symbolism revolves instead around the concept of the womb. Infibulation draws on that idea of enclosure and fertility. "[G]enital cutting completes the social definition of a child's sex by eliminating external traces of androgyny," <a href="Janice%20Boddy">Janice Boddy</a> wrote in 2007. "The female body is then covered, closed, and its productive blood bound within; the male body is unveiled, opened and exposed."

In communities where infibulation is common, there is a preference for women's genitals to be smooth, dry and without odour, and both women and men may find the natural vulva repulsive. Some men seem to enjoy the effort of penetrating an infibulation. The local preference for <a href="dry%20sex">dry sex</a> causes women to introduce substances into the vagina to reduce lubrication, including leaves, tree bark, toothpaste and <a href="Vicks%20VapoRub">Vicks menthol rub</a>. The WHO includes this practice within Type IV FGM, because the added friction during intercourse can cause lacerations and increase the risk of infection. Because of the smooth appearance of an infibulated vulva, there is also a belief that infibulation increases hygiene.

Common reasons for FGM cited by women in surveys are social acceptance, religion, hygiene, preservation of virginity, marriageability and enhancement of male sexual pleasure. In a study in northern Sudan, published in 1983, only 17.4 percent of women opposed FGM (558 out of 3,210), and most preferred excision and infibulation over clitoridectomy. Attitudes are changing slowly. In Sudan in 2010, 42 percent of women who had heard of FGM said the practice should continue. In several surveys since 2006, over 50 percent of women in Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gambia and Egypt supported FGM's continuance, while elsewhere in Africa, Iraq and Yemen most said it should end, although in several countries only by a narrow margin.

Against the argument that women willingly choose FGM for their daughters, UNICEF calls the practice a "self-enforcing social convention" to which families feel they must conform to avoid uncut daughters facing social exclusion. <a href="Ellen%20Gruenbaum">Ellen Gruenbaum</a> reported that, in Sudan in the 1970s, cut girls from an Arab ethnic group would mock uncut <a href="Zarma%20people">Zabarma</a> girls with "Ya, Ghalfa!" ("Hey, unclean!"). The Zabarma girls would respond "Ya, mutmura!" (A "mutmara" was a storage pit for grain that was continually opened and closed, like an infibulated woman.) But despite throwing the insult back, the Zabarma girls would ask their mothers, "What's the matter? Don't we have razor blades like the Arabs?"

Because of poor access to information, and because circumcisers downplay the causal connection, women may not associate the health consequences with the procedure. Lala Baldé, president of a women's association in Medina Cherif, a village in Senegal, told Mackie in 1998 that when girls fell ill or died, it was attributed to evil spirits. When informed of the causal relationship between FGM and ill health, Mackie wrote, the women broke down and wept. He argued that surveys taken before and after this sharing of information would show very different levels of support for FGM. The American non-profit group <a href="Tostan">Tostan</a>, founded by <a href="Molly%20Melching">Molly Melching</a> in 1991, introduced community-empowerment programs in several countries that focus on local democracy, literacy, and education about healthcare, giving women the tools to make their own decisions. In 1997, using the Tostan program, <a href="Malicounda%20Bambara">Malicounda Bambara</a> in Senegal became the first village to abandon FGM. By 2018 over 8,000 communities in eight countries had pledged to abandon FGM and <a href="child%20marriage">child marriage</a>.

Surveys have shown a widespread belief, particularly in Mali, Mauritania, Guinea and Egypt, that FGM is a religious requirement. Gruenbaum has argued that practitioners may not distinguish between religion, tradition and chastity, making it difficult to interpret the data. FGM's origins in northeastern Africa are pre-Islamic, but the practice became associated with Islam because of that religion's focus on female chastity and seclusion. There is no mention of it in the <a href="Quran">Quran</a>. It is praised in a few <a href="Hadith%20terminology">"daʻīf"</a> (weak) "<a href="hadith">hadith</a>" (sayings attributed to Muhammad) as noble but not required, although it is regarded as obligatory by the <a href="Shafi%27i">Shafi'i</a> version of <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Islam</a>. In 2007 the <a href="Al-Azhar%20University%23Council%20of%20Senior%20Scholars">Al-Azhar Supreme Council of Islamic Research</a> in Cairo ruled that FGM had "no basis in core Islamic law or any of its partial provisions".

There is no mention of FGM in the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. Christian missionaries in Africa were <a href="%23Colonial%20opposition%20in%20Kenya">among the first</a> to object to FGM, but Christian communities in Africa do practise it. A 2013 UNICEF report identified 17 African countries in which at least 10 percent of Christian women and girls aged 15 to 49 had undergone FGM; in Niger 55 percent of Christian women and girls had experienced it, compared with two percent of their Muslim counterparts. The only Jewish group known to have practised it are the <a href="Beta%20Israel">Beta Israel</a> of Ethiopia. Judaism requires male circumcision, but does not allow FGM. FGM is also practised by <a href="Animism">animist</a> groups, particularly in Guinea and Mali.
The practice's origins are unknown. Gerry Mackie has suggested that, because FGM's east-west, north-south distribution in Africa meets in Sudan, infibulation may have begun there with the <a href="Mero%C3%AB">Meroite civilization</a> (c. 800 BCE – c. 350 CE), before the rise of Islam, to increase confidence in paternity. According to historian Mary Knight, Spell 1117 (c. 1991–1786 BCE) of the <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ian <a href="Coffin%20Texts">Coffin Texts</a> may refer in <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphs</a> to an uncircumcised girl ("'m't"):

a-m-a:X1-D53-B1

The spell was found on the <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> of Sit-hedjhotep, now in the <a href="Egyptian%20Museum">Egyptian Museum</a>, and dates to Egypt's <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a>. (Paul F. O'Rourke argues that "'m't" probably refers instead to a menstruating woman.) The proposed circumcision of an Egyptian girl, Tathemis, is also mentioned on a Greek <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a>, from 163 BCE, in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>: "Sometime after this, Nephoris [Tathemis's mother] defrauded me, being anxious that it was time for Tathemis to be circumcised, as is the custom among the Egyptians."

The examination of <a href="Mummy">mummies</a> has shown no evidence of FGM. Citing the Australian pathologist <a href="Grafton%20Elliot%20Smith">Grafton Elliot Smith</a>, who examined hundreds of mummies in the early 20th century, Knight writes that the genital area may resemble Type III because during mummification the skin of the outer labia was pulled toward the anus to cover the <a href="pudendal%20cleft">pudendal cleft</a>, possibly to prevent sexual violation. It was similarly not possible to determine whether Types I or II had been performed, because soft tissues had deteriorated or been removed by the embalmers.

The Greek geographer <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> (c. 64 BCE – c. 23 CE) wrote about FGM after visiting Egypt around 25 BCE: "This is one of the customs most zealously pursued by them [the Egyptians]: to raise every child that is born and to circumcise ["peritemnein"] the males and excise ["ektemnein"] the females ..." <a href="Philo">Philo of Alexandria</a> (c. 20 BCE – 50 CE) also made reference to it: "the Egyptians by the custom of their country circumcise the marriageable youth and maid in the fourteenth (year) of their age, when the male begins to get seed, and the female to have a menstrual flow." It is mentioned briefly in a work attributed to the Greek physician <a href="Galen">Galen</a> (129 – c. 200 CE): "When [the clitoris] sticks out to a great extent in their young women, Egyptians consider it appropriate to cut it out." Another Greek physician, <a href="A%C3%ABtius%20of%20Amida">Aëtius of Amida</a> (mid-5th to mid-6th century CE), offered more detail in book 16 of his "Sixteen Books on Medicine", citing the physician Philomenes. The procedure was performed in case the clitoris, or "nymphê", grew too large or triggered sexual desire when rubbing against clothing. "On this account, it seemed proper to the Egyptians to remove it before it became greatly enlarged," Aëtius wrote, "especially at that time when the girls were about to be married":

The surgery is performed in this way: Have the girl sit on a chair while a muscled young man standing behind her places his arms below the girl's thighs. Have him separate and steady her legs and whole body. Standing in front and taking hold of the clitoris with a broad-mouthed forceps in his left hand, the surgeon stretches it outward, while with the right hand, he cuts it off at the point next to the pincers of the forceps.

It is proper to let a length remain from that cut off, about the size of the membrane that's between the nostrils, so as to take away the excess material only; as I have said, the part to be removed is at that point just above the pincers of the forceps. Because the clitoris is a skinlike structure and stretches out excessively, do not cut off too much, as a urinary fistula may result from cutting such large growths too deeply.

The genital area was then cleaned with a sponge, <a href="frankincense">frankincense</a> powder and wine or cold water, and wrapped in linen bandages dipped in vinegar, until the seventh day when <a href="calamine">calamine</a>, rose petals, date pits or a "genital powder made from baked clay" might be applied.

Whatever the practice's origins, infibulation became linked to slavery. Mackie cites the Portuguese missionary <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20dos%20Santos">João dos Santos</a>, who in 1609 wrote of a group near Mogadishu who had a "custome to sew up their Females, especially their slaves being young to make them unable for conception, which makes these slaves sell dearer, both for their chastitie, and for better confidence which their Masters put in them". Thus, Mackie argues, a "practice associated with shameful female slavery came to stand for honor".

Gynaecologists in 19th-century Europe and the United States removed the clitoris to treat insanity and masturbation. A British doctor, Robert Thomas, suggested clitoridectomy as a cure for <a href="nymphomania">nymphomania</a> in 1813.
The first reported clitoridectomy in the West, described in "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>" in 1825, was performed in 1822 in Berlin by <a href="Karl%20Ferdinand%20von%20Graefe">Karl Ferdinand von Graefe</a> on a 15-year-old girl who was masturbating excessively.

<a href="Isaac%20Baker%20Brown">Isaac Baker Brown</a>, an English gynaecologist, president of the <a href="Medical%20Society%20of%20London">Medical Society of London</a> and co-founder in 1845 of <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Hospital%2C%20London">St. Mary's Hospital</a>, believed that masturbation, or "unnatural irritation" of the clitoris, caused <a href="female%20hysteria">hysteria</a>, spinal irritation, fits, idiocy, mania and death. He therefore "set to work to remove the clitoris whenever he had the opportunity of doing so", according to his obituary. Brown performed several clitoridectomies between 1859 and 1866. In the United States, <a href="J.%20Marion%20Sims">J. Marion Sims</a> followed Brown's work and in 1862 slit the <a href="cervix">neck of a woman's uterus</a> and amputated her clitoris, "for the relief of the nervous or hysterical condition as recommended by Baker Brown". When Brown published his views in "On the Curability of Certain Forms of Insanity, Epilepsy, Catalepsy, and Hysteria in Females" (1866), doctors in London accused him of quackery and expelled him from the <a href="Obstetrical%20Society">Obstetrical Society</a>.

Later in the 19th century, A. J. Bloch, a surgeon in New Orleans, removed the clitoris of a two-year-old girl who was reportedly masturbating. According to a 1985 paper in the "Obstetrical & Gynecological Survey", clitoridectomy was performed in the United States into the 1960s to treat hysteria, erotomania and lesbianism. From the mid-1950s, <a href="James%20C.%20Burt">James Burt</a>, a gynaecologist in Dayton, Ohio, performed non-standard repairs of <a href="episiotomy">episiotomies</a> after childbirth, adding <a href="Husband%20stitch">more stitches</a> to make the vaginal opening smaller. From 1966 until 1989, he performed "love surgery" by cutting women's <a href="pubococcygeus%20muscle">pubococcygeus muscle</a>, repositioning the vagina and urethra, and removing the clitoral hood, thereby making their genital area more appropriate, in his view, for intercourse in the <a href="missionary%20position">missionary position</a>. "Women are structurally inadequate for intercourse," he wrote; he said he would turn them into "horny little mice". In the 1960s and 1970s he performed these procedures without consent while repairing episiotomies and performing hysterectomies and other surgery; he said he had performed a variation of them on 4,000 women by 1975. Following complaints, he was required in 1989 to stop practicing medicine in the United States.

Protestant missionaries in <a href="East%20Africa%20Protectorate">British East Africa</a> (present-day Kenya) began campaigning against FGM in the early 20th century, when Dr. <a href="John%20Arthur">John Arthur</a> joined the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> Mission (CSM) in Kikuyu. An important ethnic marker, the practice was known by the <a href="Kikuyu%20people">Kikuyu</a>, the country's main ethnic group, as "irua" for both girls and boys. It involved excision (Type II) for girls and removal of the foreskin for boys. Unexcised Kikuyu women ("irugu") were outcasts.

<a href="Jomo%20Kenyatta">Jomo Kenyatta</a>, general secretary of the <a href="Kikuyu%20Central%20Association">Kikuyu Central Association</a> and later Kenya's first prime minister, wrote in 1938 that, for the Kikuyu, the institution of FGM was the ""<a href="Sine%20qua%20non">conditio sine qua non</a>" of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion and morality". No proper Kikuyu man or woman would marry or have sexual relations with someone who was not circumcised. A woman's responsibilities toward the tribe began with her initiation. Her age and place within tribal history was traced to that day, and the group of girls with whom she was cut was named according to current events, an <a href="oral%20tradition">oral tradition</a> that allowed the Kikuyu to track people and events going back hundreds of years.

Beginning with the CSM mission in 1925, several missionary churches declared that FGM was prohibited for African Christians. The CSM announced that Africans practising it would be excommunicated, which resulted in hundreds leaving or being expelled. The stand-off turned FGM into a focal point of the Kenyan independence movement; the 1929–1931 period is known in the country's historiography as the female circumcision controversy.

In 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council began referring to FGM as the "sexual mutilation of women", rather than circumcision, and a person's stance toward the practice became a test of loyalty, either to the Christian churches or to the Kikuyu Central Association. <a href="Hulda%20Stumpf">Hulda Stumpf</a>, an American missionary with the <a href="Africa%20Inland%20Mission">Africa Inland Mission</a> who opposed FGM in the girls' school she helped to run, was murdered in 1930. <a href="Edward%20Grigg">Edward Grigg</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20and%20administrators%20of%20Kenya">governor of Kenya</a>, told the British <a href="Colonial%20Office">Colonial Office</a> that the killer, who was never identified, had tried to circumcise her.

In 1956 the council of male elders (the "Njuri Nchecke") in Meru announced a ban on FGM. Over the next three years, thousands of girls cut each other's genitals with razor blades as a symbol of defiance. The movement came to be known as "Ngaitana" ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators. FGM was eventually outlawed in Kenya in 2001, although the practice continued, reportedly driven by older women.

The first known non-colonial campaign against FGM began in Egypt in the 1920s, when the Egyptian Doctors' Society called for a ban. There was a parallel campaign in Sudan, run by religious leaders and British women. Infibulation was banned there in 1946, but the law was unpopular and barely enforced. The Egyptian government banned infibulation in state-run hospitals in 1959, but allowed partial clitoridectomy if parents requested it. (Egypt banned FGM entirely in 2007.)

In 1959, the UN asked the WHO to investigate FGM, but the latter responded that it was not a medical matter. Feminists took up the issue throughout the 1970s. The Egyptian physician and feminist <a href="Nawal%20El%20Saadawi">Nawal El Saadawi</a> criticized FGM in her book "Women and Sex" (1972); the book was banned in Egypt and El Saadawi lost her job as director general of public health. She followed up with a chapter, "The Circumcision of Girls", in her book "The Hidden Face of Eve: Women in the Arab World" (1980), which described her own clitoridectomy when she was six years old:

I did not know what they had cut off from my body, and I did not try to find out. I just wept, and called out to my mother for help. But the worst shock of all was when I looked around and found her standing by my side. Yes, it was her, I could not be mistaken, in flesh and blood, right in the midst of these strangers, talking to them and smiling at them, as though they had not participated in slaughtering her daughter just a few moments ago.
In 1975, Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American social scientist, became the first female academic to publish a detailed account of FGM, aided by her ability to discuss it directly with women in Sudan. Her article in "American Ethnologist" called it "female genital mutilation", rather than female circumcision, and brought it to wider academic attention. <a href="Edna%20Adan%20Ismail">Edna Adan Ismail</a>, who worked at the time for the Somalia Ministry of Health, discussed the health consequences of FGM in 1977 with the <a href="Somali%20Women%27s%20Democratic%20Organization">Somali Women's Democratic Organization</a>. Two years later <a href="Fran%20Hosken">Fran Hosken</a>, an Austria-American feminist, published "The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females" (1979), the first to offer global figures. She estimated that 110,529,000 women in 20 African countries had experienced FGM. The figures were speculative but consistent with later surveys. Describing FGM as a "training ground for male violence", Hosken accused female practitioners of "participating in the destruction of their own kind". The language caused a rift between Western and African feminists; African women boycotted a session featuring Hosken during the <a href="World%20Conference%20on%20Women%2C%201980">UN's Mid-Decade Conference on Women</a> in Copenhagen in July 1980.

In 1979, the WHO held a seminar, "Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children", in Khartoum, Sudan, and in 1981, also in Khartoum, 150 academics and activists signed a pledge to fight FGM after a workshop held by the <a href="Babikir%20Badri">Babiker Badri Scientific Association for Women's Studies</a> (BBSAWS), "Female Circumcision Mutilates and Endangers Women – Combat it!" Another BBSAWS workshop in 1984 invited the international community to write a joint statement for the United Nations. It recommended that the "goal of all African women" should be the eradication of FGM and that, to sever the link between FGM and religion, clitoridectomy should no longer be referred to as "sunna".

The <a href="Inter-African%20Committee%20on%20Traditional%20Practices%20Affecting%20the%20Health%20of%20Women%20and%20Children">Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children</a>, founded in 1984 in Dakar, Senegal, called for an end to the practice, as did the UN's <a href="World%20Conference%20on%20Human%20Rights">World Conference on Human Rights</a> in Vienna in 1993. The conference listed FGM as a form of <a href="violence%20against%20women">violence against women</a>, marking it as a human-rights violation, rather than a medical issue. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s governments in Africa and the Middle East passed legislation banning or restricting FGM. In 2003 the <a href="African%20Union">African Union</a> ratified the <a href="Maputo%20Protocol">Maputo Protocol</a> on the rights of women, which supported the elimination of FGM. By 2015 laws restricting FGM had been passed in at least 23 of the 27 African countries in which it is concentrated, although several fell short of a ban.

In December 1993, the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> included FGM in resolution 48/104, the <a href="Declaration%20on%20the%20Elimination%20of%20Violence%20Against%20Women">Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women</a>, and from 2003 sponsored <a href="International%20Day%20of%20Zero%20Tolerance%20for%20Female%20Genital%20Mutilation">International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation</a>, held every 6 February. UNICEF began in 2003 to promote an evidence-based <a href="social%20norms%20approach">social norms approach</a>, using ideas from <a href="game%20theory">game theory</a> about how communities reach decisions about FGM, and building on the work of Gerry Mackie on the demise of footbinding in China. In 2005 the UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre in Florence published its first report on FGM. UNFPA and UNICEF launched a joint program in Africa in 2007 to reduce FGM by 40 percent within the 0–15 age group and eliminate it from at least one country by 2012, goals that were not met and which they later described as unrealistic. In 2008 several UN bodies recognized FGM as a human-rights violation, and in 2010 the UN called upon healthcare providers to stop carrying out the procedures, including reinfibulation after childbirth and symbolic nicking. In 2012 the General Assembly passed resolution 67/146, "Intensifying global efforts for the elimination of female genital mutilations".

Immigration spread the practice to Australia, New Zealand, Europe and North America, all of which outlawed it entirely or restricted it to consenting adults. Sweden outlawed FGM in 1982 with the "Act Prohibiting the Genital Mutilation of Women", the first Western country to do so. Several former colonial powers, including Belgium, Britain, France and the Netherlands, introduced new laws or made clear that it was covered by existing legislation. legislation banning FGM had been passed in 33 countries outside Africa and the Middle East.

In the United States an estimated 513,000 women and girls had experienced FGM or were at risk as of 2012. A Nigerian woman successfully contested deportation in March 1994 on the grounds that her daughters might be cut, and in 1996 <a href="Matter%20of%20Kasinga">Fauziya Kasinga</a> from Togo became the first to be granted asylum to escape FGM. In 1996 the Federal Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act made it illegal to perform FGM on minors for non-medical reasons, and in 2013 the Transport for Female Genital Mutilation Act prohibited transporting a minor out of the country for the purpose of FGM. The first FGM conviction in the US was in 2006, when <a href="Khalid%20Adem">Khalid Adem</a>, who had emigrated from Ethiopia, was sentenced to ten years for aggravated battery and cruelty to children after severing his two-year-old daughter's clitoris with a pair of scissors. A federal judge ruled in 2018 that the 1996 Act was unconstitutional, arguing that FGM is a "local criminal activity" that should be regulated by states, not by Congress; he made his ruling during a case against members of the <a href="Dawoodi%20Bohra">Dawoodi Bohra</a> community in Michigan accused of carrying out FGM. Twenty-four states had legislation banning FGM as of 2016. The <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Pediatrics">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> opposes all forms of the practice, including pricking the clitoral skin.

Canada recognized FGM as a form of persecution in July 1994, when it granted refugee status to Khadra Hassan Farah, who had fled Somalia to avoid her daughter being cut. In 1997 section 268 of its <a href="Criminal%20Code%20%28Canada%29">Criminal Code</a> was amended to ban FGM, except where "the person is at least eighteen years of age and there is no resulting bodily harm". there had been no prosecutions. Canadian officials have expressed concern that a few thousand Canadian girls are at risk of "vacation cutting", whereby girls are taken overseas to undergo the procedure, but as of 2017 there were no firm figures.

According to the European Parliament, 500,000 women in Europe had undergone FGM . France is known for its tough stance against FGM. Up to 30,000 women there were thought to have experienced it as of 1995. According to Colette Gallard, a family-planning counsellor, when FGM was first encountered in France, the reaction was that Westerners ought not to intervene. It took the deaths of two girls in 1982, one of them three months old, for that attitude to change. In 1991 a French court ruled that the <a href="Convention%20Relating%20to%20the%20Status%20of%20Refugees">Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees</a> offered protection to FGM victims; the decision followed an asylum application from <a href="Aminata%20Diop">Aminata Diop</a>, who fled an FGM procedure in Mali. The practice is outlawed by several provisions of France's penal code that address bodily harm causing permanent mutilation or torture. All children under six who were born in France undergo medical examinations that include inspection of the genitals, and doctors are obliged to report FGM. The first civil suit was in 1982, and the first criminal prosecution in 1993. In 1999 a woman was given an eight-year sentence for having performed FGM on 48 girls. By 2014 over 100 parents and two practitioners had been prosecuted in over 40 criminal cases.

Around 137,000 women and girls living in England and Wales were born in countries where FGM is practised, as of 2011. Performing FGM on children or adults was outlawed under the <a href="Prohibition%20of%20Female%20Circumcision%20Act%201985">Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985</a>. This was replaced by the <a href="Female%20Genital%20Mutilation%20Act%202003">Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003</a> and <a href="Prohibition%20of%20Female%20Genital%20Mutilation%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%202005">Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation (Scotland) Act 2005</a>, which added a prohibition on arranging FGM outside the country for British citizens or permanent residents. The United Nations <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Elimination%20of%20All%20Forms%20of%20Discrimination%20against%20Women">Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women</a> (CEDAW) asked the government in July 2013 to "ensure the full implementation of its legislation on FGM". The first charges were brought in 2014 against a physician and another man; the physician had stitched an infibulated woman after opening her for childbirth. Both men were acquitted in 2015.

Anthropologists have accused FGM eradicationists of <a href="cultural%20imperialism">cultural colonialism</a>, and have been criticized in turn for their <a href="moral%20relativism">moral relativism</a> and failure to defend the idea of universal <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a>. According to critics of the eradicationist position, the <a href="Reductionism%23In%20science">biological reductionism</a> of the opposition to FGM, and the failure to appreciate FGM's cultural context, serves to "<a href="Othering">other</a>" practitioners and undermine their agency—in particular when parents are referred to as "mutilators".

Africans who object to the tone of FGM opposition risk appearing to defend the practice. The feminist theorist <a href="Obioma%20Nnaemeka">Obioma Nnaemeka</a>, herself strongly opposed to FGM, argued in 2005 that renaming the practice "female genital mutilation" had introduced "a subtext of barbaric African and Muslim cultures and the West's relevance (even indispensability) in purging [it]". According to Ugandan law professor <a href="Sylvia%20Tamale">Sylvia Tamale</a>, the early Western opposition to FGM stemmed from a Judeo-Christian judgment that African sexual and family practices, including not only FGM but also <a href="dry%20sex">dry sex</a>, <a href="polygyny">polygyny</a>, <a href="bride%20price">bride price</a> and <a href="levirate%20marriage">levirate marriage</a>, required correction. African feminists "take strong exception to the imperialist, racist and dehumanising infantilization of African women", she wrote in 2011. Commentators highlight the voyeurism in the treatment of women's bodies as exhibits. Examples include images of women's vaginas after FGM or girls undergoing the procedure. The 1996 <a href="%23Pulitzer">Pulitzer-prize-winning photographs</a> of a 16-year-old Kenyan girl experiencing FGM were published by 12 American newspapers, without her consent either to be photographed or to have the images published.

The debate has highlighted a tension between anthropology and feminism, with the former's focus on tolerance and the latter's on equal rights for women. According to the anthropologist Christine Walley, a common position in anti-FGM literature has been to present African women as victims of <a href="false%20consciousness">false consciousness</a> participating in their own oppression, a position promoted by feminists in the 1970s and 1980s, including Fran Hosken, <a href="Mary%20Daly">Mary Daly</a> and Hanny Lightfoot-Klein. It prompted the French Association of Anthropologists to issue a statement in 1981, at the height of the early debates, that "a certain feminism resuscitates (today) the moralistic arrogance of yesterday's colonialism".

Nnaemeka argues that the crucial question, broader than FGM, is why the female body is subjected to so much "abuse and indignity", including in the West. Several authors have drawn a parallel between FGM and cosmetic procedures. Ronán Conroy of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20in%20Ireland">Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland</a> wrote in 2006 that cosmetic genital procedures were "driving the advance" of FGM by encouraging women to see natural variations as defects. Anthropologist <a href="Fadwa%20El%20Guindi">Fadwa El Guindi</a> compared FGM to <a href="Breast%20augmentation">breast enhancement</a>, in which the maternal function of the breast becomes secondary to men's sexual pleasure. <a href="Beno%C3%AEte%20Groult">Benoîte Groult</a>, the French feminist, made a similar point in 1975, citing FGM and cosmetic surgery as sexist and patriarchal. Against this, the medical anthropologist <a href="Carla%20Obermeyer">Carla Obermeyer</a> argued in 1999 that FGM may be conducive to a subject's social well-being in the same way that <a href="rhinoplasty">rhinoplasty</a> and male circumcision are. Despite the 2007 ban in Egypt, Egyptian women wanting FGM for their daughters seek "amalyet tajmeel" (cosmetic surgery) to remove what they see as excess genital tissue.
Cosmetic procedures such as <a href="labiaplasty">labiaplasty</a> and <a href="clitoral%20hood%20reduction">clitoral hood reduction</a> do fall within the WHO's definition of FGM, which aims to avoid loopholes, but the WHO notes that these elective practices are generally not regarded as FGM. Some legislation banning FGM, such as in Canada and the US, covers minors only, but several countries, including Sweden and the UK, have banned it regardless of consent. Sweden, for example, has banned operations "on the outer female sexual organs with a view to mutilating them or bringing about some other permanent change in them, regardless of whether or not consent has been given for the operation". Gynaecologist Birgitta Essén and anthropologist Sara Johnsdotter argue that the law seems to distinguish between Western and African genitals, and deems only African women (such as those seeking reinfibulation after childbirth) unfit to make their own decisions.

The philosopher <a href="Martha%20Nussbaum">Martha Nussbaum</a> argues that a key concern with FGM is that it is mostly conducted on children using physical force. The distinction between social pressure and physical force is morally and legally salient, comparable to the distinction between seduction and rape. She argues further that the literacy of women in practising countries is generally poorer than in developed nations, which reduces their ability to make informed choices.

Several commentators maintain that children's rights are violated not only by FGM but also by the genital alteration of <a href="intersex">intersex</a> children, who are born with anomalies that physicians choose to correct. Arguments have been made that <a href="Religious%20male%20circumcision">non-therapeutic male circumcision</a>, practised by Muslims, Jews and some Christian groups, also violates children's rights. Globally about 30 percent of males over 15 are circumcised; of these, about two-thirds are Muslim. An <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Pediatrics">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> circumcision task force issued a policy statement in 2012 that the health benefits of male circumcision outweigh the risks; they recommended that it be carried out, if it is performed, by "trained and competent practitioners ... using sterile techniques and effective pain management". The statement met with protests from a group of 38 doctors in Europe, who accused the task force of "cultural bias". At least half the male population of the United States is circumcised, while most men in Europe are not.

Finnish Civil War

The Finnish Civil War was a conflict for the leadership and control of <a href="Finland">Finland</a> during the country's transition from a <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Finland">Grand Duchy</a> of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> to an independent state. The clashes took place in the context of <a href="Aftermath%20of%20World%20War%20I">the national, political, and social turmoil</a> caused by <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (<a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Eastern Front</a>) in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. The civil war was fought between the "Reds", led by a section of the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Finland">Social Democratic Party</a>, and the "Whites", conducted by the <a href="conservatism">conservative</a>-based <a href="Senate%20of%20Finland">Senate</a> and the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Imperial Army</a>. The <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> <a href="Red%20Guards%20%28Finland%29">Red Guards</a>, composed of industrial and agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centres of southern Finland. The paramilitary <a href="White%20Guard%20%28Finland%29">White Guards</a>, composed of farmers, along with middle-class and upper-class social strata, controlled rural central and northern Finland.

In the years before the conflict, Finnish society had experienced rapid population growth, <a href="industrialisation">industrialisation</a>, pre-urbanisation and the rise of a comprehensive <a href="labour%20movement">labour movement</a>. The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of <a href="democratisation">democratisation</a> and modernisation. The socio-economic condition and education of the population had gradually improved, as well as national thinking and cultural life had awakened.

<a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> led to <a href="Russian%20Revolution">the collapse of the Russian Empire</a>, causing a <a href="power%20vacuum">power vacuum</a> in Finland, and a subsequent struggle for dominance led to militarisation and an escalating crisis between the left-leaning labour movement and the conservatives. The Reds carried out an unsuccessful general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by <a href="Soviet%20Russia">Soviet Russia</a>. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>'s military detachments in April. The decisive engagements were the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tampere">Battles of Tampere</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Vyborg">Vyborg</a> (; ), won by the Whites, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Helsinki">Battles of Helsinki</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Lahti">Lahti</a>, won by German troops, leading to overall victory for the Whites and the German forces. <a href="Political%20violence">Political violence</a> became a part of this warfare. Around 12,500 Red <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> died of malnutrition and disease in <a href="Finnish%20Civil%20War%20prison%20camps">camps</a>. About 39,000 people, of whom 36,000 were Finns, perished in the conflict.

In the aftermath, the Finns passed from Russian governance to the German <a href="sphere%20of%20influence">sphere of influence</a> with a plan to establish a German-led <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Finland%20%281918%29">Finnish monarchy</a>. The scheme was cancelled with the defeat of <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> in World War I and Finland instead emerged as an independent, democratic republic. The Civil War divided the nation for decades. Finnish society was reunited through social compromises based on a long-term culture of moderate politics and religion and the post-war economic recovery.

The main factor behind the Finnish Civil War was a political crisis arising out of World War I. Under the pressures of the Great War, the Russian Empire collapsed, leading to the <a href="February%20Revolution">February</a> and <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a>s in 1917. This breakdown caused a <a href="power%20vacuum">power vacuum</a> and a subsequent struggle for power in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>. Russia's Grand Duchy of Finland (1809-1917), became embroiled in the turmoil. <a href="Geopolitically">Geopolitically</a> less important than the continental <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>–<a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> gateway, Finland, isolated by the <a href="Baltic%20sea">Baltic Sea</a> was a peaceful side front until early 1918. The war between the German Empire and Russia had only indirect effects on the <a href="Finns">Finns</a>. Since the end of the 19th century, the Grand Duchy had become a vital source of <a href="raw%20materials">raw materials</a>, industrial products, food and labour for the growing Imperial Russian capital <a href="Petrograd">Petrograd</a> (modern Saint Petersburg), and World War I emphasised that role. Strategically, the Finnish territory was the less important northern section of the Estonian–Finnish gateway and a buffer zone to and from Petrograd through the <a href="Narva">Narva</a> area, the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a> and the <a href="Karelian%20Isthmus">Karelian Isthmus</a>.

The German Empire saw Eastern Europe—primarily Russia—as a major source of vital products and raw materials, both during World War I and for the future. Her resources overstretched by the two-front war, Germany attempted to divide Russia by providing financial support to revolutionary groups, such as the <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> and the <a href="Socialist%20Revolutionary%20Party">Socialist Revolutionary Party</a>, and to radical, separatist factions, such as the Finnish national activist movement leaning toward <a href="Pan-Germanism">Germanism</a>. Between 30 and 40 million <a href="German%20Papiermark">marks</a> were spent on this endeavour. Controlling the Finnish area would allow the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Army">Imperial German Army</a> to penetrate Petrograd and the <a href="Kola%20Peninsula">Kola Peninsula</a>, an area rich in raw materials for the mining industry. Finland possessed large ore reserves and a well-developed forest industry.

From 1809 to 1898, a period called "Pax Russica", the peripheral authority of the Finns gradually increased, and Russo-Finnish relations were exceptionally peaceful in comparison with other parts of the Russian Empire. Russia's defeat in the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> in the 1850s led to attempts to speed up the modernisation of the country. This caused more than 50 years of economic, industrial, cultural and educational progress in the Grand Duchy of Finland, including an improvement in the status of the Finnish language. All this encouraged Finnish nationalism and cultural unity through the birth of the <a href="Fennoman%20movement">Fennoman movement</a>, which bound the Finns to the domestic administration and led to the idea that the Grand Duchy was an increasingly autonomous state of the Russian Empire.

In 1899, the Russian Empire initiated a policy of integration through the <a href="Russification%20of%20Finland">Russification of Finland</a>. The strengthened, <a href="Pan-Slavism">pan-slavist</a> central power tried to unite the "Russian Multinational Dynastic Union" as the military and strategic situation of Russia became more perilous due to the rise of Germany and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. Finns called the increased military and <a href="Administration%20%28government%29">administrative</a> control, "the First Period of Oppression", and for the first time Finnish politicians drew up plans for disengagement from Russia or sovereignty for Finland. In the struggle against integration, activists drawn from sections of the working class and the Swedish-speaking intelligentsia carried out terrorist acts. During World War I and the rise of Germanism, the pro-Swedish <a href="Svecoman%20movement">Svecomans</a> began their covert collaboration with Imperial Germany and, from 1915 to 1917, a <a href="J%C3%A4ger%20Movement">Jäger</a> (; ) battalion consisting of 1,900 Finnish volunteers was trained in Germany.

The major reasons for rising political tensions among Finns were the autocratic rule of the Russian <a href="czar">czar</a> and the undemocratic class system of the <a href="estates%20of%20the%20realm">estates of the realm</a>. The latter system originated in the regime of the <a href="Swedish%20Empire">Swedish Empire</a> that preceded Russian governance and divided the Finnish people economically, socially and politically. Finland's population grew rapidly in the nineteenth century (from 860,000 in 1810 to 3,130,000 in 1917), and a class of agrarian and industrial workers, as well as <a href="croft%20%28land%29">crofters</a> emerged over the period. The <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> was rapid in Finland, though it started later than in the rest of <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>. Industrialisation was financed by the state and some of the social problems associated with the industrial process were diminished by the administration's actions. Among urban workers, socio-economic problems steepened during periods of industrial depression. The position of rural workers worsened after the end of the nineteenth century, as farming became more efficient and market-oriented, and the development of industry was not vigorous enough to fully utilise the rapid population growth of the countryside.

The difference between Scandinavian-Finnish (<a href="Finno-Ugric%20peoples">Finno-Ugric peoples</a>) and Russian-<a href="Slavic%20people">Slavic</a> culture affected the nature of Finnish national integration. The upper social strata took the lead and gained domestic authority from the Russian czar in 1809. The estates planned to build up an increasingly autonomous Finnish state, led by the elite and the intelligentsia. The Fennoman movement aimed to include the common people in a non-political role; the labour movement, youth associations and the temperance movement were initially led "from above".

Between 1870 and 1916 industrialisation gradually improved social conditions and the self-confidence of workers, but while the standard of living of the common people rose in absolute terms, the rift between rich and poor deepened markedly. The commoners' rising awareness of socio-economic and political questions interacted with the ideas of <a href="socialism">socialism</a>, <a href="social%20liberalism">social liberalism</a> and <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>. The workers' initiatives and the corresponding responses of the dominant authorities intensified social conflict in Finland.The Finnish labour movement, which emerged at the end of the nineteenth century from <a href="temperance%20movement%20in%20Finland">temperance</a>, <a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20of%20Finland%23History">religious movements</a> and Fennomania, had a Finnish nationalist, <a href="working-class">working-class</a> character. From 1899 to 1906, the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the paternalistic thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by the Finnish Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers' activism was directed both toward opposing <a href="Russification">Russification</a> and in developing a domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for <a href="democracy">democracy</a>. This was a reaction to the domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between the Finnish nobility-<a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> and the labour movement concerning voting rights for the common people.
Despite their obligations as obedient, peaceful and non-political inhabitants of the Grand Duchy (who had, only a few decades earlier, accepted the class system as the natural order of their life), the commoners began to demand their <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> and <a href="citizenship">citizenship</a> in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labour movement. On the other side, due to an at-least century-long tradition and experience of administrative authority, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural leader of the nation. The political struggle for democracy was solved outside Finland, in international politics: the Russian Empire's failed <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">1904–1905 war against Japan</a> led to the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201905">1905 Revolution</a> in Russia and to <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201905%23Finland">a general strike in Finland</a>. In an attempt to quell the general unrest, the system of estates was abolished in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Finland%23History">Parliamentary Reform of 1906</a>. The general strike increased support for the <a href="Social%20Democrats">social democrats</a> substantially. The party encompassed a higher proportion of the population than any other socialist movement in the world.

The Reform of 1906 was a giant leap towards the political and social liberalisation of the common Finnish people: the Russian <a href="House%20of%20Romanov">House of Romanov</a> having been the most autocratic and conservative ruler in Europe. The Finns adopted a unicameral parliamentary system, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Finland">Parliament of Finland</a> (; ) with <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>. The number of voters increased from 126,000 to 1,273,000, including female citizens. The reform led to the social democrats obtaining about fifty percent of the popular vote, but the Czar regained his authority after the crisis of 1905. Subsequently, during the more severe programme of Russification, called "the Second Period of Oppression" by the Finns, the Czar neutralised the power of the Finnish Parliament between 1908 and 1917. He dissolved the assembly, ordered parliamentary elections almost annually, and determined the composition of the Finnish Senate, which did not correlate with the Parliament.

The capacity of the Finnish Parliament to solve socio-economic problems was stymied by confrontations between the largely uneducated commoners and the former estates. Another conflict festered as employers denied <a href="collective%20bargaining">collective bargaining</a> and the right of the labour unions to represent workers. The parliamentary process disappointed the labour movement, but as dominance in the Parliament and legislation was the workers' most likely way to obtain a more balanced society, they identified themselves with the state. Overall domestic politics led to a contest for leadership of the Finnish state during the ten years before the collapse of the Russian Empire.

The Second Period of Russification was halted on 15 March 1917 by the February Revolution, which removed the Russian czar, <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II</a>. The collapse of Russia was caused by military defeats, <a href="war-weariness">war-weariness</a> against the duration and hardships of the Great War, and the collision between the most conservative regime in Europe and a Russian people desiring modernisation. The Czar's power was transferred to the <a href="State%20Duma%20%28Russian%20Empire%29">State Duma</a> (Russian Parliament) and the right-wing <a href="Russian%20Provisional%20Government">Provisional Government</a>, but this new authority was challenged by the <a href="Petrograd%20Soviet">Petrograd Soviet</a> (city council), leading to <a href="dual%20power">dual power</a> in the country.

The autonomous status of 1809–1899 was returned to the Finns by the March 1917 manifesto of the Russian Provisional Government. For the first time in history, "de facto" political power existed in the Parliament of Finland. The political left, consisting mainly of social democrats, covered a wide spectrum from moderate to revolutionary socialists. The political right was even more diverse, ranging from social liberals and moderate conservatives to rightist conservative elements. The four main parties were:

During 1917, a power struggle and social disintegration interacted. The collapse of Russia induced a chain reaction of disintegration, starting from the government, military and economy, and spreading to all fields of society, such as local administration, workplaces and to individual citizens. The social democrats wanted to retain the civil rights already achieved and to increase the socialists' power over society. The conservatives feared the loss of their long-held socio-economic dominance. Both factions collaborated with their equivalents in Russia, deepening the split in the nation.

The Social Democratic Party gained an <a href="absolute%20majority">absolute majority</a> in the <a href="Finnish%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201916">parliamentary elections of 1916</a>. A new Senate was formed in March 1917 by <a href="Oskari%20Tokoi">Oskari Tokoi</a>, but it did not reflect the socialists' large parliamentary majority: it comprised six social democrats and six non-socialists. In theory, the Senate consisted of a broad national coalition, but in practice (with the main political groups unwilling to <a href="compromise">compromise</a> and top politicians remaining outside of it), it proved unable to solve any major Finnish problem. After the February Revolution, political authority descended to the street level: mass meetings, strike organisations and worker-soldier councils on the left and to active organisations of employers on the right, all serving to undermine the authority of the state.

The February Revolution halted the Finnish economic boom caused by the Russian war-economy. The collapse in business led to unemployment and high <a href="inflation">inflation</a>, but the employed workers gained an opportunity to resolve workplace problems. The commoners' call for the <a href="eight-hour%20day">eight-hour working day</a>, better working conditions and higher wages led to demonstrations and large-scale strikes in industry and agriculture.

While the Finns had specialised in <a href="milk">milk</a> and <a href="butter">butter</a> production, the bulk of the food supply for the country depended on cereals produced in southern Russia. The cessation of cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing <a href="rationing">rationing</a> and <a href="price%20controls">price controls</a>. The farmers resisted the state control and a <a href="black%20market">black market</a>, accompanied by sharply rising food prices formed and export to the free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices and, in the end, the fear of <a href="starvation">starvation</a> became emotional political issues between farmers and urban workers, especially those who were unemployed. Common people, their fears exploited by politicians and an incendiary, polarised political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no actual large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.

The passing of the Tokoi Senate bill called the "Law of Supreme Power" (, more commonly known as "valtalaki"; ) in July 1917, triggered one of the key crises in the power struggle between the social democrats and the conservatives. The fall of the Russian Empire opened the question of who would hold sovereign political authority in the former Grand Duchy. After decades of political disappointment, the February Revolution offered the Finnish social democrats an opportunity to govern; they held the absolute majority in Parliament. The conservatives were alarmed by the continuous increase of the socialists' influence since 1899, which reached a climax in 1917.

The "Law of Supreme Power" incorporated a plan by the socialists to substantially increase the authority of Parliament, as a reaction to the non-parliamentary and conservative leadership of the Finnish Senate between 1906 and 1916. The bill furthered Finnish autonomy in domestic affairs: the Russian Provisional Government was only allowed the right to control Finnish foreign and military policies. The Act was adopted with the support of the Social Democratic Party, the Agrarian League, part of the Young Finnish Party and some activists eager for Finnish sovereignty. The conservatives opposed the bill and some of the most right-wing representatives resigned from Parliament.

In Petrograd, the social democrats' plan had the backing of the Bolsheviks. They had been plotting a revolt against the Provisional Government since April 1917, and pro-Soviet demonstrations during the <a href="July%20Days">July Days</a> brought matters to a head. The Helsinki Soviet and the Regional Committee of the Finnish Soviets, led by the Bolshevik <a href="Ivar%20Smilga">Ivar Smilga</a>, both pledged to defend the Finnish Parliament, were it threatened with attack. However, the Provisional Government still had sufficient support in the Russian army to survive and as the street movement waned, <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> fled to Karelia. In the aftermath of these events, the "Law of Supreme Power" was overruled and the social democrats eventually backed down; more Russian troops were sent to Finland and, with the co-operation and insistence of the Finnish conservatives, Parliament was dissolved and new elections announced.

In the <a href="Finnish%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201917">October 1917 elections</a>, the social democrats lost their absolute majority, which radicalised the <a href="labor%20movement">labour movement</a> and decreased support for moderate politics. The crisis of July 1917 did not bring about the Red Revolution of January 1918 on its own, but together with political developments based on the commoners' interpretation of the ideas of <a href="Fennomania">Fennomania</a> and socialism, the events favoured a Finnish revolution. In order to win power, the socialists had to overcome Parliament.

The February Revolution resulted in a loss of institutional authority in Finland and the dissolution of the <a href="police">police</a> force, creating fear and uncertainty. In response, both the right and left assembled their own security groups, which were initially local and largely unarmed. By late 1917, following the dissolution of Parliament, in the absence of a strong government and national armed forces, the security groups began assuming a broader and more paramilitary character. The Civil Guards (; ; ) and the later White Guards (; ) were organised by local men of influence: conservative academics; industrialists; major landowners, and activists. The Workers' Order Guards (; ) and the Red Guards (; ) were recruited through the local social democratic party sections and from the labour unions.

The Bolsheviks' and Vladimir Lenin's October Revolution of 7 November 1917 transferred political power in Petrograd to the radical, left-wing socialists. The German government's decision to arrange safe conduct for Lenin and his comrades from exile in Switzerland to Petrograd in April 1917, was a success. An <a href="Armistice%20between%20Russia%20and%20the%20Central%20Powers">armistice between Germany and the Bolshevik regime</a> came into force on 6 December and peace negotiations began on 22 December 1917 at <a href="Brest%2C%20Belarus">Brest-Litovsk</a>.

November 1917 became another watershed in the 1917–1918 rivalry for the leadership of Finland. After the dissolution of the Finnish Parliament, <a href="Polarization%20%28politics%29">polarisation</a> between the social democrats and the conservatives increased markedly and the period witnessed the appearance of political violence. An agricultural worker had been shot during a local strike on 9 August 1917 at <a href="Yp%C3%A4j%C3%A4">Ypäjä</a> and a Civil Guard member was killed in a local political crisis at Malmi on 24 September. The October Revolution disrupted the informal truce between the Finnish non-socialists and the Russian Provisional Government. After political wrangling over how to react to the revolt, the majority of the politicians accepted a compromise proposal by <a href="Santeri%20Alkio">Santeri Alkio</a>, the leader of the Agrarian League. Parliament seized the sovereign power in Finland on 15 November 1917 based on the socialists' "Law of Supreme Power" and ratified their proposals of an <a href="eight-hour%20working%20day">eight-hour working day</a> and universal suffrage in <a href="local%20election">local election</a>s, from July 1917.
A purely non-socialist, conservative-led government of <a href="Pehr%20Evind%20Svinhufvud">Pehr Evind Svinhufvud</a> was appointed on 27 November. This nomination was both a long-term aim of the conservatives and a response to the challenges of the labour movement during November 1917. Svinhufvud's main aspirations were to separate Finland from Russia, to strengthen the Civil Guards, and to return a part of Parliament's new authority to the Senate. There were 149 Civil Guards on 31 August 1917 in Finland, counting local units and subsidiary White Guards in towns and rural communes; 251 on 30 September; 315 on 31 October; 380 on 30 November and 408 on 26 January 1918. The first attempt at serious military training among the Guards was the establishment of a 200-strong cavalry school at the Saksanniemi estate in the vicinity of the town of <a href="Porvoo">Porvoo</a>, in September 1917. The <a href="vanguard">vanguard</a> of the Finnish <a href="J%C3%A4ger%20Movement">Jägers</a> and German weaponry arrived in Finland during October–November 1917 on the ' freighter and the German U-boat '; around 50 Jägers had returned by the end of 1917.

After political defeats in July and October 1917, the social democrats put forward an uncompromising program called "We Demand" (; ) on 1 November, in order to push for <a href="concession%20%28politics%29">political concessions</a>. They insisted upon a return to the political status before the dissolution of Parliament in July 1917, disbandment of the Civil Guards and elections to establish a Finnish Constituent Assembly. The program failed and the socialists initiated a general strike during 14–19 November to increase political pressure on the conservatives, who had opposed the "Law of Supreme Power" and the parliamentary proclamation of sovereign power on 15 November.

<a href="Revolution">Revolution</a> became the goal of the radicalised socialists after the loss of political control, and events in November 1917 offered momentum for a socialist uprising. In this phase, Lenin and <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, under threat in Petrograd, urged the social democrats to take power in Finland. The majority of Finnish socialists were moderate and preferred parliamentary methods, prompting the Bolsheviks to label them "reluctant revolutionaries". The reluctance diminished as the general strike appeared to offer a major channel of influence for the workers in southern Finland. The strike leadership voted by a narrow majority to start a revolution on 16 November, but the uprising had to be called off the same day due to the lack of active revolutionaries to execute it.
At the end of November 1917, the moderate socialists among the social democrats won a second vote over the radicals in a debate over revolutionary versus parliamentary means, but when they tried to pass a resolution to completely abandon the idea of a socialist revolution, the party representatives and several influential leaders voted it down. The Finnish labour movement wanted to sustain a military force of its own and to keep the revolutionary road open too. The wavering Finnish socialists disappointed V. I. Lenin and in turn, he began to encourage the Finnish Bolsheviks in Petrograd.

Among the labour movement, a more marked consequence of the events of 1917 was the rise of the Workers' Order Guards. There were 20–60 separate guards between 31 August and 30 September 1917, but on 20 October, after defeat in parliamentary elections, the Finnish labour movement proclaimed the need to establish more worker units. The announcement led to a rush of recruits: on 31 October the number of guards was 100–150; 342 on 30 November 1917 and 375 on 26 January 1918. Since May 1917, the paramilitary organisations of the left had grown in two phases, the majority of them as Workers' Order Guards. The minority were Red Guards, these were partly underground groups formed in industrialised towns and industrial centres, such as <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, <a href="Kotka">Kotka</a> and Tampere, based on the original Red Guards that had been built up during 1905–1906 in Finland.

The presence of the two opposing armed forces created a state of dual power and divided sovereignty on Finnish society. The decisive rift between the guards broke out during the general strike: the Reds executed several political opponents in southern Finland and the first armed clashes between the Whites and Reds took place. In total, 34 casualties were reported. Eventually, the political rivalries of 1917 led to an <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a> and an <a href="Conflict%20escalation">escalation</a> towards civil war.

The disintegration of Russia offered Finns an historic opportunity to gain national independence. After the October Revolution, the conservatives were eager for secession from Russia in order to control the left and minimise the influence of the Bolsheviks. The socialists were skeptical about sovereignty under conservative rule, but they feared a loss of support among nationalistic workers, particularly after having promised increased national liberty through the "Law of Supreme Power". Eventually, both political factions supported an independent Finland, despite strong disagreement over the composition of the nation's leadership.

Nationalism had become a "civic religion" in Finland by the end of nineteenth century, but the goal during the general strike of 1905 was a return to the autonomy of 1809–1898, not full independence. In comparison to the unitary Swedish regime, the domestic power of Finns had increased under the less uniform Russian rule. Economically, the Grand Duchy of Finland benefited from having an independent domestic state budget, a central bank with national currency, the <a href="Finnish%20markka">markka</a> (deployed 1860), and customs organisation and the industrial progress of 1860–1916. The economy was dependent on the huge Russian market and separation would disrupt the profitable Finnish financial zone. The economic collapse of Russia and the power struggle of the Finnish state in 1917 were among the key factors that brought sovereignty to the fore in Finland.
Svinhufvud's Senate introduced <a href="Finland%27s%20declaration%20of%20independence">Finland's Declaration of Independence</a> on 4 December 1917 and Parliament adopted it on 6 December. The social democrats voted against the Senate's proposal, while presenting an alternative declaration of sovereignty. The establishment of an independent state was not a guaranteed conclusion for the small Finnish nation. Recognition by Russia and other <a href="great%20power">great power</a>s was essential; Svinhufvud accepted that he had to negotiate with Lenin for the acknowledgement. The socialists, having been reluctant to enter talks with the Russian leadership in July 1917, sent two delegations to Petrograd to request that Lenin approve Finnish sovereignty.

In December 1917, Lenin was under intense pressure from the Germans to conclude <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk">peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk</a> and the Bolsheviks' rule was in crisis, with an inexperienced administration and the demoralised army facing powerful political and military opponents. Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could fight for central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner. As a result, Svinhufvud's delegation won Lenin's concession of sovereignty on 31 December 1917.

By the beginning of the Civil War, <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland had recognised Finnish independence. The United Kingdom and United States did not approve it; they waited and monitored the relations between Finland and Germany (the main enemy of the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a>), hoping to override Lenin's regime and to get Russia back into the war against the German Empire. In turn, the Germans hastened Finland's separation from Russia so as to move the country to within their sphere of influence.

The final escalation towards war began in early January 1918, as each military or political action of the Reds or the Whites resulted in a corresponding counteraction by the other. Both sides justified their activities as defensive measures, particularly to their own supporters. On the left, the vanguard of the movement was the urban Red Guards from <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, <a href="Kotka">Kotka</a> and <a href="Turku">Turku</a>; they led the rural Reds and convinced the socialist leaders who wavered between peace and war to support the revolution. On the right, the vanguard was the Jägers, who had transferred to Finland, and the volunteer Civil Guards of southwestern Finland, southern <a href="Ostrobothnia%20%28region%29">Ostrobothnia</a> and <a href="Viipuri%20province">Vyborg province</a> in the southeastern corner of Finland. The first local battles were fought during 9–21 January 1918 in southern and southeastern Finland, mainly to win the arms race and to control <a href="Vyborg">Vyborg</a> (; ).
On 12 January 1918, Parliament authorised the Svinhufvud Senate to establish internal order and discipline on behalf of the state. On 15 January, Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, a former Finnish general of the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Army">Imperial Russian Army</a>, was appointed the commander-in-chief of the Civil Guards. The Senate appointed the Guards, henceforth called the White Guards, as the White Army of Finland. Mannerheim placed his <a href="Defence%20Command%20%28Finland%29">Headquarters of the White Army</a> in the <a href="Vaasa">Vaasa</a>–<a href="Sein%C3%A4joki">Seinäjoki</a> area. The White Order to engage was issued on 25 January. The Whites gained weaponry by disarming Russian garrisons during 21–28 January, in particular in southern Ostrobothnia.

The Red Guards, led by <a href="Ali%20Aaltonen">Ali Aaltonen</a>, refused to recognise the Whites' hegemony and established a military authority of their own. Aaltonen installed his headquarters in Helsinki and nicknamed it <a href="Smolna%2C%20Helsinki">Smolna</a> echoing the <a href="Smolny%20Institute">Smolny Institute</a>, the Bolsheviks' headquarters in Petrograd. The Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the uprising, was lit in the tower of the <a href="Paasitorni">Helsinki Workers' House</a>. A large-scale mobilisation of the Reds began late in the evening of 27 January, with the Helsinki Red Guard and some of the Guards located along the Vyborg-Tampere railway having been activated between 23 and 26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolshevik weapons from Petrograd to Finland. White troops tried to capture the shipment: 20–30 Finns, Red and White, died in the <a href="Battle%20of%20K%C3%A4m%C3%A4r%C3%A4">Battle of Kämärä</a> at the Karelian Isthmus on 27 January 1918. The Finnish rivalry for power had culminated.

At the beginning of the war, a discontinuous <a href="front%20line">front line</a> ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the country into <a href="White%20Finland">White Finland</a> and <a href="Red%20Finland">Red Finland</a>. The Red Guards controlled the area to the south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, along with the largest estates and farms with the highest numbers of crofters and <a href="tenant%20farmer">tenant farmer</a>s. The White Army controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian and contained small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers. The number of crofters was lower and they held a better social status than those in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed on both sides of the front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of <a href="Varkaus">Varkaus</a>, <a href="Kuopio">Kuopio</a>, <a href="Oulu">Oulu</a>, <a href="Raahe">Raahe</a>, <a href="Kemi">Kemi</a> and <a href="Tornio">Tornio</a>; within the Red area lay Porvoo, <a href="Kirkkonummi">Kirkkonummi</a> and <a href="Uusikaupunki">Uusikaupunki</a>. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.

Red Finland was led by the People's Delegation (; ), established on 28 January 1918 in Helsinki. The delegation sought democratic socialism based on the Finnish Social Democratic Party's ethos; their visions differed from Lenin's <a href="dictatorship%20of%20the%20proletariat">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>. <a href="Otto%20Ville%20Kuusinen">Otto Ville Kuusinen</a> formulated a proposal for a new constitution, influenced by those of Switzerland and the United States. With it, political power was to be concentrated to Parliament, with a lesser role for a government. The proposal included a multi-party system; freedom of assembly, speech and press; and the use of <a href="referenda">referenda</a> in political decision-making. In order to ensure the authority of the labour movement, the common people would have a right to <a href="permanent%20revolution">permanent revolution</a>. The socialists planned to transfer a substantial part of <a href="property%20rights%20%28economics%29">property rights</a> to the state and local administrations.

In foreign policy, Red Finland leaned on <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Bolshevist Russia</a>. A Red-initiated Finno–Russian treaty and peace agreement was signed on 1 March 1918, where Red Finland was called the <a href="Finnish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Republic">Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic</a> (; ). The negotiations for the treaty implied that –as in World War I in general– nationalism was more important for both sides than the principles of <a href="international%20socialism">international socialism</a>. The Red Finns did not simply accept an alliance with the Bolsheviks and major disputes appeared, for example, over the demarcation of the border between Red Finland and Soviet Russia. The significance of the Russo–Finnish Treaty evaporated quickly due to the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between the Bolsheviks and the German Empire on 3 March 1918.

Lenin's policy on the right of nations to <a href="self-determination">self-determination</a> aimed at preventing the disintegration of Russia during the period of military weakness. He assumed that in war-torn, splintering Europe, the <a href="proletariat">proletariat</a> of free nations would carry out socialist revolutions and unite with Soviet Russia later. The majority of the Finnish labour movement supported Finland's independence. The Finnish Bolsheviks, influential, though few in number, favoured annexation of Finland by Russia.

The government of White Finland, <a href="Pehr%20Evind%20Svinhufvud%27s%20first%20senate">Pehr Evind Svinhufvud's first senate</a>, was called the Vaasa Senate after its relocation to the safer west-coast city of Vaasa, which acted as the capital of the Whites from 29 January to 3 May 1918. In domestic policy, the White Senate's main goal was to return the political right to power in Finland. The conservatives planned a monarchist political system, with a lesser role for Parliament. A section of the conservatives had always supported <a href="monarchy">monarchy</a> and opposed democracy; others had approved of <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentarianism</a> since the revolutionary reform of 1906, but after the crisis of 1917–1918, concluded that empowering the common people would not work. Social liberals and reformist non-socialists opposed any restriction of parliamentarianism. They initially resisted German military help, but the prolonged warfare changed their stance.

In foreign policy, the Vaasa Senate relied on the German Empire for military and political aid. Their objective was to defeat the Finnish Reds; end the influence of Bolshevist Russia in Finland and expand Finnish territory to <a href="East%20Karelia">East Karelia</a>, a geopolitically significant home to people speaking <a href="Finno-Ugric%20languages">Finno-Ugric languages</a>. The weakness of Russia inspired an idea of <a href="Greater%20Finland">Greater Finland</a> among the expansionist factions of both the right and left: the Reds had claims concerning the same areas. General Mannerheim agreed on the need to take over East Karelia and to request German weapons, but opposed actual German intervention in Finland. Mannerheim recognised the Red Guards' lack of combat skill and trusted in the abilities of the German-trained Finnish Jägers. As a former Russian army officer, Mannerheim was well aware of the demoralisation of the Russian army. He co-operated with White-aligned Russian officers in Finland and Russia.

The number of Finnish troops on each side varied from 70,000 to 90,000 and both had around 100,000 rifles, 300–400 machine guns and a few hundred cannons. While the Red Guards consisted mostly of <a href="Military%20volunteer">volunteers</a>, with wages paid at the beginning of the war, the White Army consisted predominantly of <a href="conscription">conscripts</a> with 11,000–15,000 volunteers. The main motives for volunteering were socio-economic factors, such as salary and food, as well as idealism and peer pressure. The Red Guards included 2,600 women, mostly girls recruited from the industrial centres and cities of southern Finland. Urban and agricultural workers constituted the majority of the Red Guards, whereas land-owning farmers and well-educated people formed the backbone of the White Army. Both armies used <a href="child%20soldiers">child soldiers</a>, mainly between 14 and 17 years of age. The use of juvenile soldiers was not rare in World War I; children of the time were under the absolute authority of adults and were not shielded against exploitation.

Rifles and machine guns from Imperial Russia were the main armaments of the Reds and the Whites. The most commonly used rifle was the Russian <a href="Mosin%E2%80%93Nagant">Mosin–Nagant</a> Model 1891. In total, around ten different rifle models were in service, causing problems for ammunition supply. The <a href="Maxim%20gun">Maxim gun</a> was the most-used machine gun, along with the less-used <a href="M1895%20Colt-Browning%20machine%20gun">M1895 Colt–Browning</a>, <a href="Lewis%20gun">Lewis</a> and <a href="Madsen%20machine%20gun">Madsen</a> guns. The machine guns caused a substantial part of the casualties in combat. Russian <a href="field%20gun">field gun</a>s were mostly used with <a href="direct%20fire">direct fire</a>.

The Civil War was fought primarily along <a href="railways">railways</a>; vital means for transporting troops and supplies, as well for using armoured trains, equipped with light cannons and <a href="heavy%20machine%20gun">heavy machine gun</a>s. The strategically most important railway junction was <a href="Haapam%C3%A4ki">Haapamäki</a>, approximately northeast of Tampere, connecting eastern and western Finland and as well as southern and northern Finland. Other critical junctions included <a href="Kouvola">Kouvola</a>, <a href="Riihim%C3%A4ki">Riihimäki</a>, Tampere, <a href="Toijala">Toijala</a> and Vyborg. The Whites captured Haapamäki at the end of January 1918, leading to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vilppula">Battle of Vilppula</a>.

The Finnish Red Guards seized the early initiative in the war by taking control of Helsinki on 28 January 1918 and by undertaking a general offensive lasting from February till early March 1918. The Reds were relatively well armed, but a chronic shortage of skilled leaders, both at the command level and in the field, left them unable to capitalise on this momentum, and most of the offensives came to nothing. The military <a href="Command%20hierarchy">chain of command</a> functioned relatively well at company and platoon level, but leadership and authority remained weak as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of the troops. The common troops were more or less armed civilians, whose military training, discipline and combat morale were both inadequate and low.

Ali Aaltonen was replaced on 28 January 1918 by <a href="Eero%20Haapalainen">Eero Haapalainen</a> as commander-in-chief. He, in turn, was displaced by the Bolshevik triumvirate of <a href="Eino%20Rahja">Eino Rahja</a>, <a href="Adolf%20Taimi">Adolf Taimi</a> and <a href="Evert%20Eloranta">Evert Eloranta</a> on 20 March. The last commander-in-chief of the Red Guard was Kullervo Manner, from 10 April until the last period of the war when the Reds no longer had a named leader. Some talented local commanders, such as <a href="Hugo%20Salmela">Hugo Salmela</a> in the Battle of Tampere, provided successful leadership, but could not change the course of the war. The Reds achieved some local victories as they retreated from southern Finland toward Russia, such as against German troops in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Syrj%C3%A4ntaka">Battle of Syrjäntaka</a> on 28–29 April in Tuulos.

The revolutions in Russia divided the Soviet army officers politically and their attitude towards the Finnish Civil War varied. <a href="Mikhail%20Svechnikov">Mikhail Svechnikov</a> led Finnish Red troops in western Finland in February and <a href="Konstantin%20Yeremejev">Konstantin Yeremejev</a> Soviet forces on the Karelian Isthmus, while other officers were mistrustful of their revolutionary peers and instead co-operated with General Mannerheim, in disarming Soviet garrisons in Finland. On 30 January 1918, Mannerheim proclaimed to Russian soldiers in Finland that the White Army did not fight against Russia, but that the objective of the White campaign was to beat the Finnish Reds and the Soviet troops supporting them.

The number of Soviet soldiers active in the civil war declined markedly once Germany attacked Russia on 18 February 1918. The German-Soviet Treaty of Brest-Litovsk of 3 March restricted the Bolsheviks' support for the Finnish Reds to weapons and supplies. The Soviets remained active on the south-eastern front, mainly in the Battle of Rautu on the Karelian Isthmus between February and April 1918, where they defended the approaches to Petrograd.

While the conflict has been called by some, "The War of Amateurs", the White Army had two major advantages over the Red Guards: the professional military leadership of Gustaf Mannerheim and his staff, which included 84 Swedish volunteer officers and former Finnish officers of the czar's army; and 1,450 soldiers of the 1,900-strong, Jäger battalion. The majority of the unit arrived in Vaasa on 25 February 1918. On the battlefield, the Jägers, battle-hardened on the Eastern Front, provided strong leadership that made disciplined combat of the common White troopers possible. The soldiers were similar to those of the Reds, having brief and inadequate training. At the beginning of the war, the White Guards' top leadership had little authority over volunteer White units, which obeyed only their local leaders. At the end of February, the Jägers started a rapid training of six conscript regiments.

The Jäger battalion was politically divided, too. Four-hundred-and-fifty –mostly socialist– Jägers remained stationed in Germany, as it was feared they were likely to side with the Reds. White Guard leaders faced a similar problem when drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labour movement never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troops drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds. The Whites' propaganda promoted the idea that they were fighting a defensive war against <a href="Bolshevist">Bolshevist</a> Russians, and belittled the role of the Red Finns among their enemies. Social divisions appeared both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland. The economy and society of the north had modernised more slowly than that of the south. There was a more pronounced conflict between <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="socialism">socialism</a> in the north, and the ownership of farmland conferred major <a href="social%20status">social status</a>, motivating the farmers to fight against the Reds.

Sweden declared neutrality both during World War I and the Finnish Civil War. General opinion, in particular among the Swedish elite, was divided between supporters of the Allies and the <a href="Central%20powers">Central powers</a>, Germanism being somewhat more popular. Three war-time priorities determined the pragmatic policy of the Swedish liberal-social democratic government: sound economics, with export of <a href="iron-ore">iron-ore</a> and foodstuff to Germany; sustaining the tranquility of Swedish society; and geopolitics. The government accepted the participation of Swedish volunteer officers and soldiers in the Finnish White Army in order to block expansion of revolutionary unrest to <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>.

A 1,000-strong paramilitary <a href="Swedish%20Brigade">Swedish Brigade</a>, led by <a href="Hjalmar%20Frisell">Hjalmar Frisell</a>, took part in the Battle of Tampere and in the fighting south of the town. In February 1918, the <a href="Swedish%20Navy">Swedish Navy</a> escorted the German naval squadron transporting Finnish Jägers and German weapons and allowed it to pass through Swedish territorial waters. The Swedish socialists tried to open peace negotiations between the Whites and the Reds. The weakness of Finland offered Sweden a chance to take over the geopolitically vital Finnish <a href="%C3%85land%20islands">Åland Islands</a>, east of <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, but the German army's Finland operation stalled this plan.

In March 1918, the German Empire intervened in the Finnish Civil War on the side of the White Army. Finnish activists leaning on Germanism had been seeking German aid in freeing Finland from Soviet hegemony since late 1917, but because of the pressure they were facing at the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, the Germans did not want to jeopardise their armistice and <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk%23Peace%20negotiations">peace negotiations</a> with the Soviet Union. The German stance changed after 10 February when <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>, despite the weakness of the Bolsheviks' position, broke off negotiations, hoping revolutions would break out in the German Empire and change everything. On 13 February, the German leadership decided to retaliate and send military detachments to Finland too. As a pretext for aggression, the Germans invited "requests for help" from the western neighbouring countries of Russia. Representatives of White Finland in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> duly requested help on 14 February.

The <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">Imperial German Army</a> attacked Russia on 18 February. <a href="Operation%20Faustschlag">The offensive</a> led to a rapid collapse of the Soviet forces and to the signing of the first Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by the Bolsheviks on 3 March 1918. Finland, the Baltic countries, <a href="Poland">Poland</a> and <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> were transferred to the German sphere of influence. The Finnish Civil War opened a low-cost access route to <a href="Fennoscandia">Fennoscandia</a>, where the <a href="geopolitical">geopolitical</a> status was altered as a British Naval squadron <a href="North%20Russia%20Intervention">invaded</a> the Soviet harbour of <a href="Murmansk">Murmansk</a> by the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> on 9 March 1918. The leader of the German war effort, General <a href="Erich%20Ludendorff">Erich Ludendorff</a>, wanted to keep Petrograd under threat of attack via the Vyborg-Narva area and to install a German-led monarchy in Finland.

On 5 March 1918, a German naval squadron landed on the <a href="%C3%85land">Åland Islands</a> (in mid-February 1918, the islands had been occupied by a Swedish military expedition, which departed from there in May). On 3 April 1918, the 10,000-strong <a href="Baltic%20Sea%20Division">Baltic Sea Division</a> (), led by General <a href="R%C3%BCdiger%20von%20der%20Goltz">Rüdiger von der Goltz</a>, launched the main attack at <a href="Hanko">Hanko</a>, west of Helsinki. It was followed on 7 April by Colonel <a href="Otto%20von%20Brandenstein">Otto von Brandenstein's</a> 3,000-strong <a href="Detachment%20Brandenstein">Detachment Brandenstein</a> () taking the town of <a href="Loviisa">Loviisa</a> east of Helsinki. The larger German formations advanced eastwards from Hanko and took Helsinki on 12–13 April, while Detachment Brandenstein overran the town of <a href="Lahti">Lahti</a> on 19 April. The main German detachment proceeded northwards from Helsinki and took <a href="Hyvink%C3%A4%C3%A4">Hyvinkää</a> and <a href="Riihim%C3%A4ki">Riihimäki</a> on 21–22 April, followed by <a href="H%C3%A4meenlinna">Hämeenlinna</a> on 26 April. The final blow to the cause of the Finnish Reds was dealt when the Bolsheviks broke off the peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, leading to the German eastern offensive in February 1918.

In February 1918, General Mannerheim deliberated on where to focus the general offensive of the Whites. There were two strategically vital enemy strongholds: Tampere, Finland's major industrial town in the south-west, and Vyborg, Karelia's main city. Although seizing Vyborg offered many advantages, his army's lack of combat skills and the potential for a major counterattack by the Reds in the area or in the south-west made it too risky.

Mannerheim decided to strike first at Tampere. He launched the main assault on 16 March 1918, at <a href="L%C3%A4ngelm%C3%A4ki">Längelmäki</a> north-east of the town, through the right flank of the Reds' defence. At the same time, the Whites attacked through the north-western frontline <a href="Vilppula">Vilppula</a>–<a href="Kuru%2C%20Finland">Kuru</a>–Kyröskoski–<a href="Suodenniemi">Suodenniemi</a>. Although the Whites were unaccustomed to offensive warfare, some Red Guard units collapsed and retreated in panic under the weight of the offensive, while other Red detachments defended their posts to the last and were able to slow the advance of the White troops. Eventually, the Whites lay siege to Tampere. They cut off the Reds' southward connection at <a href="Lemp%C3%A4%C3%A4l%C3%A4">Lempäälä</a> on 24 March and westward ones at Siuro, <a href="Nokia%2C%20Finland">Nokia</a>, and <a href="Yl%C3%B6j%C3%A4rvi">Ylöjärvi</a> on 25 March.

The Battle for Tampere was fought between 16,000 White and 14,000 Red soldiers. It was Finland's first large-scale <a href="urban%20warfare">urban battle</a> and one of the four most decisive military engagements of the war. The fight for the area of Tampere began on 28 March, on the eve of Easter 1918, later called "Bloody <a href="Maundy%20Thursday">Maundy Thursday</a>", in the Kalevankangas cemetery. The White Army did not achieve a decisive victory in the fierce combat, suffering more than 50 percent losses in some of their units. The Whites had to re-organise their troops and battle plans, managing to raid the town centre in the early hours of 3 April.

After a heavy, concentrated <a href="Barrage%20%28artillery%29">artillery barrage</a>, the White Guards advanced from house to house and street to street, as the Red Guards retreated. In the late evening of 3 April, the Whites reached the eastern banks of the <a href="Tammerkoski">Tammerkoski</a> rapids. The Reds' attempts to break the siege of Tampere from the outside along the Helsinki-Tampere railway failed. The Red Guards lost the western parts of the town between 4 and 5 April. The <a href="Tampere%20City%20Hall">Tampere City Hall</a> was among the last strongholds of the Reds. The battle ended 6 April 1918 with the surrender of Red forces in the <a href="Pyynikki">Pyynikki</a> and <a href="Pispala">Pispala</a> sections of Tampere.

The Reds, now on the defensive, showed increased motivation to fight during the battle. General Mannerheim was compelled to deploy some of the best-trained Jäger detachments, initially meant to be conserved for later use in the Vyborg area. The Battle of Tampere was the bloodiest action of the Civil War. The White Army lost 700–900 men, including 50 Jägers, the highest number of deaths the Jäger battalion suffered in a single battle of the 1918 war. The Red Guards lost 1,000–1,500 soldiers, with a further 11,000–12,000 captured. 71 civilians died, mainly due to artillery fire. The eastern parts of the city, consisting mostly of wooden buildings, were completely destroyed.

After peace talks between Germans and the Finnish Reds were broken off on 11 April 1918, the battle for the capital of Finland began. At 05:00 on 12 April, around 2,000–3,000 German Baltic Sea Division soldiers, led by Colonel Hans von Tschirsky und von Bögendorff, attacked the city from the north-west, supported via the <a href="Rantarata">Helsinki-Turku railway</a>. The Germans broke through the area between <a href="Munkkiniemi">Munkkiniemi</a> and <a href="Pasila">Pasila</a>, and advanced on the central-western parts of the town. The German naval squadron led by Vice Admiral <a href="Hugo%20Meurer">Hugo Meurer</a> blocked the city harbour, bombarded the southern town area, and landed "<a href="Seebataillon">Seebataillon</a>" marines at <a href="Katajanokka">Katajanokka</a>.

Around 7,000 Finnish Reds defended Helsinki, but their best troops fought on other fronts of the war. The main strongholds of the Red defence were the <a href="Helsinki%20Workers%27%20Hall">Workers' Hall</a>, the <a href="Helsinki%20railway%20station">Helsinki railway station</a>, the Red Headquarters at <a href="Smolna%2C%20Helsinki">Smolna</a>, the <a href="Government%20Palace%20%28Finland%29">Senate Palace</a>–<a href="Helsinki%20University">Helsinki University</a> area and the former Russian garrisons. By the late evening of 12 April, most of the southern parts and all of the western area of the city had been occupied by the Germans. Local Helsinki White Guards, having hidden in the city during the war, joined the battle as the Germans advanced through the town.

On 13 April, German troops took over the <a href="Market%20Square%2C%20Helsinki">Market Square</a>, the Smolna, the Presidential Palace and the Senate-<a href="Ritarihuone">Ritarihuone</a> area. Toward the end, a German brigade with 2,000–3,000 soldiers, led by Colonel Kondrad Wolf joined the battle. The unit rushed from north to the eastern parts of Helsinki, pushing into the working-class neighborhoods of <a href="Hermanni%20%28Helsinki%29">Hermanni</a>, <a href="Kallio">Kallio</a> and <a href="S%C3%B6rn%C3%A4inen">Sörnäinen</a>. German artillery bombarded and destroyed the Workers' Hall and put out the red lantern of the Finnish revolution. The eastern parts of the town surrendered around 14:00 on 13 April, when a white flag was raised in the tower of the <a href="Kallio%20Church">Kallio Church</a>. Sporadic fighting lasted until the evening. In total, 60 Germans, 300–400 Reds and 23 White Guard troopers were killed in the battle. Around 7,000 Reds were captured. The German army celebrated the victory with a military parade in the centre of Helsinki on 14 April 1918.

On 19 April 1918, Detachment Brandenstein took over the town of Lahti. The German troops advanced from the east-southeast via <a href="Nastola">Nastola</a>, through the Mustankallio graveyard in <a href="Salpausselk%C3%A4">Salpausselkä</a> and the Russian garrisons at <a href="Hennala">Hennala</a>. The battle was minor but strategically important as it cut the connection between the western and eastern Red Guards. Local engagements broke out in the town and the surrounding area between 22 April and 1 May 1918 as several thousand western Red Guards and Red civilian refugees tried to push through on their way to Russia. The German troops were able to hold major parts of the town and halt the Red advance. In total, 600 Reds and 80 German soldiers perished, and 30,000 Reds were captured in and around Lahti.

After the defeat in Tampere, the Red Guards began a slow retreat eastwards. As the German army seized Helsinki, the White Army shifted the military focus to Vyborg area, where 18,500 Whites advanced against 15,000 defending Reds. General Mannerheim's war plan had been revised as a result of the Battle for Tampere, a civilian, industrial town. He aimed to avoid new, complex city combat in Vyborg, an old military fortress. The Jäger detachments tried to tie down and destroy the Red force outside the town. The Whites were able to cut the Reds' connection to Petrograd and weaken the troops on the Karelian Isthmus on 20–26 April, but the decisive blow remained to be dealt in Vyborg. The final attack began on late 27 April with a heavy Jäger artillery barrage. The Reds' defence collapsed gradually, and eventually the Whites conquered <a href="Patterinm%C3%A4ki">Patterinmäki</a>—the Reds' symbolic last stand of the 1918 uprising—in the early hours of 29 April 1918. In total, 400 Whites died, and 500–600 Reds perished and 12,000–15,000 were captured.

Both Whites and Reds carried out political violence through executions, respectively termed White Terror (; ) and Red Terror (; ). The threshold of political violence had already been crossed by the Finnish activists during the First Period of Russification. Large-scale terror operations were born and bred in Europe during World War I, the first <a href="total%20war">total war</a>. The February and October Revolutions initiated similar violence in Finland: at first by Russian army troops executing their officers, later between the Finnish Reds and Whites.

The terror consisted of a calculated aspect of general warfare and, on the other hand, the local, personal murders and corresponding acts of revenge. In the former, the commanding staff planned and organised the actions and gave orders to the lower ranks. At least a third of the Red terror and most of the White terror was centrally led. In February 1918, a "Desk of Securing Occupied Areas" was implemented by the highest-ranking White staff, and the White troops were given "Instructions for Wartime Judicature", later called the <a href="Shoot%20on%20the%20Spot%20Declaration">Shoot on the Spot Declaration</a>. This order authorised field commanders to execute essentially anyone they saw fit. No order by the less-organised, highest Red Guard leadership authorising Red Terror has been found. The paper was "burned" or the command was oral.

The main goals of the terror were to destroy the command structure of the enemy; to clear and secure the areas governed and occupied by armies; and to create shock and fear among the civil population and the enemy soldiers. Additionally, the common troops' paramilitary nature and their lack of combat skills drove them to use political violence as a military weapon. Most of the executions were carried out by cavalry units called Flying Patrols, consisting of 10 to 80 soldiers aged 15 to 20 and led by an experienced, adult leader with absolute authority. The patrols, specialised in <a href="search%20and%20destroy">search and destroy</a> operations and <a href="Death%20Squad">death squad</a> tactics, were similar to German Sturmbattalions and Russian Assault units organized during World War I. The terror achieved some of its objectives but also gave additional motivation to fight against an enemy perceived to be inhuman and cruel. Both Red and White propaganda made effective use of their opponents' actions, increasing the spiral of revenge.
The Red Guards executed influential Whites, including politicians, major landowners, industrialists, police officers, civil servants and teachers as well as White Guards. Ten priests of the <a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20of%20Finland">Evangelical Lutheran Church</a> and 90 moderate socialists were killed. The number of executions varied over the war months, peaking in February as the Reds secured power, but March saw low counts because the Reds could not seize new areas outside of the original frontlines. The numbers rose again in April as the Reds aimed to leave Finland. The two major centres for Red Terror were Toijala and Kouvola, where 300–350 Whites were executed between February and April 1918.

The White Guards executed Red Guard and party leaders, Red troops, socialist members of the Finnish Parliament and local Red administrators, and those active in implementing Red Terror. The numbers varied over the months as the Whites conquered southern Finland. Comprehensive White Terror started with their general offensive in March 1918 and increased constantly. It peaked at the end of the war and declined and ceased after the enemy troops had been transferred to prison camps. During the high point of the executions, between the end of April and the beginning of May, 200 Reds were shot per day. White Terror was decisive against Russian soldiers who assisted the Finnish Reds, and several Russian non-socialist civilians were killed in the <a href="Vyborg%20massacre">Vyborg massacre</a>, the aftermath of the Battle of Vyborg.

In total, 1,650 Whites died as a result of Red Terror, while around 10,000 Reds perished by White Terror, which turned into <a href="Political%20cleansing%20of%20population">political cleansing</a>. White victims have been recorded exactly, while the number of Red troops executed immediately after battles remains unclear. Together with the harsh prison-camp treatment of the Reds during 1918, the executions inflicted the deepest mental scars on the Finns, regardless of their political allegiance. Some of those who carried out the killings were traumatised, a phenomenon that was later documented.

On 8 April 1918, after the defeat in Tampere and the German army intervention, the People's Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Vyborg. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April. The escape of the leadership embittered many Reds, and thousands of them tried to flee to Russia, but most of the refugees were encircled by White and German troops. In the Lahti area they surrendered on 1–2 May. The long Red caravans included women and children, who experienced a desperate, chaotic escape with severe losses due to White attacks. The scene was described as a "road of tears" for the Reds, but for the Whites, the sight of long, enemy caravans heading east was a victorious moment. The Red Guards' last strongholds between the Kouvola and Kotka area fell by 5 May, after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ahvenkoski">Battle of Ahvenkoski</a>. The war of 1918 ended on 15 May 1918, when the Whites took over <a href="Fort%20Ino">Fort Ino</a>, a Russian <a href="coastal%20artillery">coastal artillery</a> base on the Karelian Isthmus, from the Russian troops. White Finland and General Mannerheim celebrated the victory with a large military parade in Helsinki on 16 May 1918.

The Red Guards had been defeated. The initially <a href="pacifist">pacifist</a> Finnish labour movement had lost the Civil War, several military leaders committed suicide and a majority of the Reds were sent to prison camps. The Vaasa Senate returned to Helsinki on 4 May 1918, but the capital was under the control of the German army. White Finland had become a protectorate of the German Empire and General Rüdiger von der Goltz was called "the true Regent of Finland". No armistice or peace negotiations were carried out between the Whites and Reds and an official peace treaty to end the Finnish Civil War was never signed.

The White Army and German troops captured around 80,000 Red prisoners of war (POWs), including 5,000 women, 1,500 children and 8,000 Russians. The largest <a href="List%20of%20concentration%20and%20internment%20camps%23Finland">prison camps</a> were Suomenlinna (an island facing Helsinki), Hämeenlinna, Lahti, Riihimäki, <a href="Eken%C3%A4s%2C%20Finland">Tammisaari</a>, Tampere and Vyborg. The Senate decided to keep the POWs detained until each individual's role in the Civil War had been investigated. Legislation making provision for a Treason Court (; ) was enacted on 29 May 1918. The judicature of the 145 inferior courts led by the Supreme Treason Court (; ) did not meet the standards of <a href="impartiality">impartiality</a>, due to the condemnatory atmosphere of White Finland. In total 76,000 cases were examined and 68,000 Reds were convicted, primarily for <a href="treason">treason</a>; 39,000 were released on <a href="parole">parole</a> while the mean-length of punishment for the rest was two to four years in jail. 555 people were sentenced to <a href="death">death</a>, of whom 113 were executed. The trials revealed that some innocent adults had been imprisoned.

Combined with the severe food shortages caused by the Civil War, mass imprisonment led to high mortality rates in the POW camps, and the catastrophe was compounded by the angry, punitive and uncaring mentality of the victors. Many prisoners felt that they had been abandoned by their own leaders, who had fled to Russia. The physical and mental condition of the POWs declined in May 1918. Many prisoners had been sent to the camps in Tampere and Helsinki in the first half of April and food supplies were disrupted during the Reds' eastward retreat. Consequently, in June 2,900 prisoners starved to death, or died as a result of diseases caused by malnutrition or the <a href="Spanish%20flu">Spanish flu</a>: 5,000 in July; 2,200 in August; and 1,000 in September. The mortality rate was highest in the <a href="Tammisaari%20prison%20camp">Tammisaari camp</a> at 34 percent, while the rate varied between 5 percent and 20 percent in the others. In total, around 12,500 Finns perished (3,000–4,000 due to the Spanish flu) while detained. The dead were buried in <a href="mass%20graves">mass graves</a> near the camps. Moreover, 700 severely weakened POWs died soon after release from the camps.

Most POWs were paroled or pardoned by the end of 1918, after a shift in the political situation. There were 6,100 Red prisoners left at the end of the year and 4,000 at the end of 1919. In January 1920, 3,000 POWs were pardoned and civil rights were returned to 40,000 former Reds. In 1927, the Social Democratic Party government led by <a href="V%C3%A4in%C3%B6%20Tanner">Väinö Tanner</a> pardoned the last 50 prisoners. The Finnish government paid <a href="Reparation%20%28legal%29">reparations</a> to 11,600 POWs in 1973. The traumatic hardships of the prison camps increased support for communism in Finland.

The Civil War was a catastrophe for Finland: around 36,000 people – 1.2 percent of the population – perished. The war left approximately 15,000 children orphaned. Most of the casualties occurred outside the battlefields: in the prison camps and the terror campaigns. Many Reds fled to Russia at the end of the war and during the period that followed. The fear, bitterness and trauma caused by the war deepened the divisions within Finnish society and many moderate Finns identified themselves as "citizens of two nations."

The conflict caused disintegration within both socialist and non-socialist factions. The rightward shift of power caused a dispute between conservatives and liberals on the best system of government for Finland to adopt: the former demanded monarchy and restricted parliamentarianism; the latter demanded a democratic republic. Both sides justified their views on political and legal grounds. The monarchists leaned on the Swedish regime's 1772 monarchist constitution (accepted by Russia in 1809), belittled the Declaration of Independence of 1917, and proposed a modernised, monarchist constitution for Finland. The republicans argued that the 1772 law lost validity in the February Revolution, that the authority of the Russian czar was assumed by the Finnish Parliament on 15 November 1917, and that the Republic of Finland had been adopted on 6 December that year. The republicans were able to halt the passage of the monarchists' proposal in Parliament. The royalists responded by applying the 1772 law to select a new monarch for the country without reference to Parliament.

The Finnish labour movement was divided into three parts: moderate social democrats in Finland; radical socialists in Finland; and communists in Soviet Russia. The Social Democratic Party had its first official party meeting after the Civil War on 25 December 1918, at which the party proclaimed a commitment to parliamentary means and disavowed Bolshevism and communism. The leaders of Red Finland, who had fled to Russia, established the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Finland">Communist Party of Finland</a> in Moscow on 29 August 1918. After the power struggle of 1917 and the bloody civil war, the former Fennomans and the social democrats who had supported "ultra-democratic" means in Red Finland declared a commitment to revolutionary Bolshevism–communism and to the dictatorship of the proletariat, under the control of Lenin.

In May 1918, a conservative-monarchist Senate was formed by <a href="Juho%20Kusti%20Paasikivi">J. K. Paasikivi</a>, and the Senate asked the German troops to remain in Finland. 3 March 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and 7 March German-Finnish agreements bound White Finland to the German Empire's sphere of influence. General Mannerheim resigned his post on 25 May after disagreements with the Senate about German hegemony over Finland, and about his planned attack on Petrograd to repulse the Bolsheviks and capture Russian Karelia. The Germans opposed these plans due to their peace treaties with Lenin. The Civil War weakened the Finnish Parliament; it became a Rump Parliament that included only three socialist representatives.

On 9 October 1918, under pressure from Germany, the Senate and Parliament elected a German prince, <a href="Prince%20Frederick%20Charles%20of%20Hesse">Friedrich Karl</a>, the brother-in-law of German Emperor <a href="William%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">William II</a>, to become the King of Finland. The German leadership was able to utilise the breakdown of Russia for the geopolitical benefit of the German Empire in Fennoscandia also. The Civil War and the aftermath diminished independence of Finland, compared to the status it had held at the turn of the year 1917–1918.

The economic condition of Finland deteriorated drastically from 1918; recovery to pre-conflict levels was achieved only in 1925. The most acute crisis was in food supply, already deficient in 1917, though large-scale starvation had been avoided that year. The Civil War caused marked starvation in southern Finland. Late in 1918, Finnish politician <a href="Rudolf%20Holsti">Rudolf Holsti</a> appealed for relief to <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>, the American chairman of the <a href="Committee%20for%20Relief%20in%20Belgium">Committee for Relief in Belgium</a>. Hoover arranged for the delivery of food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, and to allow food into the country.

On 15 March 1917, the fate of Finns had been decided outside Finland, in Petrograd. On 11 November 1918, the future of the nation was determined in Berlin, as a result of Germany's surrender to end World War I. The German Empire collapsed in the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%9319">German Revolution of 1918–19</a>, caused by lack of food, war-weariness and defeat in the battles of the Western Front. General Rüdiger von der Goltz and his division left Helsinki on 16 December 1918, and Prince Friedrich Karl, who had not yet been crowned, abandoned his role four days later. Finland's status shifted from a monarchist protectorate of the German Empire to an independent republic. The new system of government was confirmed by the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Finland">Constitution Act</a> (; ) on 17 July 1919.

The first local elections based on universal suffrage in Finland were held during 17–28 December 1918, and the first free parliamentary election took place after the Civil War on 3 March 1919. The United States and the United Kingdom recognised Finnish sovereignty on 6–7 May 1919. The Western powers demanded the establishment of democratic republics in post-war Europe, to lure the masses away from widespread revolutionary movements. The Finno–Russian <a href="Treaty%20of%20Tartu%20%28Russian-Finnish%29">Treaty of Tartu</a> was signed on 14 October 1920, with the aim of stabilizing political relations between Finland and Russia and settling the border question.

In April 1918, the leading Finnish social liberal and the eventual first President of Finland, <a href="Kaarlo%20Juho%20St%C3%A5hlberg">Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg</a> wrote: "It is urgent to get the life and development in this country back on the path that we had already reached in 1906 and which the turmoil of war turned us away from." Moderate social democrat <a href="V%C3%A4in%C3%B6%20Voionmaa">Väinö Voionmaa</a> agonised in 1919: "Those who still trust in the future of this nation must have an exceptionally strong faith. This young independent country has lost almost everything due to the war." Voionmaa was a vital companion for the leader of the reformed Social Democratic Party, Väinö Tanner.

Santeri Alkio supported moderate politics. His party colleague, <a href="Ky%C3%B6sti%20Kallio">Kyösti Kallio</a> urged in his Nivala address of 5 May 1918: "We must rebuild a Finnish nation, which is not divided into the Reds and Whites. We have to establish a democratic Finnish republic, where all the Finns can feel that we are true citizens and members of this society." In the end, many of the moderate Finnish conservatives followed the thinking of National Coalition Party member <a href="Lauri%20Ingman">Lauri Ingman</a>, who wrote in early 1918: "A political turn more to the right will not help us now, instead it would strengthen the support of socialism in this country."

Together with other broad-minded Finns, the new partnership constructed a Finnish compromise which eventually delivered a stable and broad parliamentary democracy. The compromise was based both on the defeat of the Reds in the Civil War and the fact that most of the Whites' political goals had not been achieved. After foreign forces left Finland, the militant factions of the Reds and the Whites lost their backing, while the pre-1918 cultural and national integrity and the legacy of Fennomania stood out among the Finns.

The weakness of both Germany and Russia after World War I empowered Finland and made a peaceful, domestic Finnish social and political settlement possible. A reconciliation process led to a slow and painful, but steady, national unification. In the end, the power vacuum and <a href="interregnum">interregnum</a> of 1917–1919 gave way to the Finnish compromise. From 1919 to 1991, the democracy and sovereignty of the Finns withstood challenges from right-wing and left-wing political radicalism, the crisis of World War II and <a href="Finlandization">pressure from the Soviet Union</a> during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>.

Between 1918 and the 1950s, mainstream literature and poetry presented the 1918 war from the White victors' point of view, with works such as the "Psalm of the Cannons" () by <a href="Arvi%20J%C3%A4rventaus">Arvi Järventaus</a> in 1918. In poetry, <a href="Bertel%20Gripenberg">Bertel Gripenberg</a>, who had volunteered for the White Army, celebrated its cause in "The Great Age" () in 1928 and <a href="V.%20A.%20Koskenniemi">V. A. Koskenniemi</a> in "Young Anthony" () in 1918. The war tales of the Reds were kept silent.

The first neutrally critical books were written soon after the war, notably, "Devout Misery" () written by the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize laureate</a> <a href="Frans%20Emil%20Sillanp%C3%A4%C3%A4">Frans Emil Sillanpää</a> in 1919; "Dead Apple Trees" () by <a href="Joel%20Lehtonen">Joel Lehtonen</a> in 1918; and "Homecoming" () by <a href="Runar%20Schildt">Runar Schildt</a> in 1919. These were followed by <a href="Jarl%20Hemmer">Jarl Hemmer</a> in 1931 with the book "A Man and His Conscience" () and <a href="Oiva%20Paloheimo">Oiva Paloheimo</a> in 1942 with "Restless Childhood" (). <a href="Lauri%20Viita">Lauri Viita's</a> book "Scrambled Ground" () from 1950 presented the life and experiences of a worker family in the Tampere of 1918, including a point of view from outsiders to the Civil War.

Between 1959 and 1962, <a href="V%C3%A4in%C3%B6%20Linna">Väinö Linna</a> described in his trilogy "<a href="Under%20the%20North%20Star">Under the North Star</a>" () the Civil War and World War II from the viewpoint of the common people. Part II of Linna's work opened a larger view of these events and included tales of the Reds in the 1918 war. At the same time, a new outlook on the war was opened by <a href="Paavo%20Haavikko">Paavo Haavikko's</a> book "Private Matters" (), <a href="Veijo%20Meri">Veijo Meri</a>'s "The Events of 1918" () and <a href="Paavo%20Rintala">Paavo Rintala's</a> "My Grandmother and Mannerheim" (), all published in 1960. In poetry, <a href="Viljo%20Kajava">Viljo Kajava</a>, who had experienced the Battle of Tampere at the age of nine, presented a pacifist view of the Civil War in his "Poems of Tampere" () in 1966. The same battle is described in the novel "Corpse Bearer" () by <a href="Antti%20Tuuri">Antti Tuuri</a> from 2007. <a href="Jenni%20Linturi">Jenni Linturi</a>'s multilayered "Malmi 1917" (2013) describes contradictory emotions and attitudes in a village drifting towards civil war.

Väinö Linna's trilogy turned the general tide, and after it, several books were written mainly from the Red viewpoint: The Tampere-trilogy by <a href="Erkki%20Lepokorpi">Erkki Lepokorpi</a> in 1977; <a href="Juhani%20Syrj%C3%A4">Juhani Syrjä's</a> "Juho 18" in 1998; "The Command" () by <a href="Leena%20Lander">Leena Lander</a> in 2003; and "Sandra" by <a href="Heidi%20K%C3%B6ng%C3%A4s">Heidi Köngäs</a> in 2017. <a href="Kjell%20West%C3%B6">Kjell Westö's</a> epic novel "<a href="Where%20We%20Once%20Went">Where We Once Went</a>" (), published in 2006, deals with the period of 1915–1930 from both the Red and the White sides. Westö's book "Mirage 38" () from 2013, describes post-war traumas of the 1918 war and Finnish mentality in the 1930s. Many of the stories have been utilised in motion pictures and in theatre.

Fridtjof Nansen

Fridtjof Nansen (; 10 October 1861 – 13 May 1930) was a Norwegian explorer, scientist, diplomat, humanitarian and <a href="List%20of%20Nobel%20Peace%20Prize%20laureates">Nobel Peace Prize laureate</a>. In his youth he was a champion skier and ice skater. He led the team that made the first crossing of the <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> interior in 1888, traversing the island on cross-country skis. He won international fame after reaching a record northern latitude of 86°14′ during his <a href="Nansen%27s%20Fram%20expedition">"Fram" expedition</a> of 1893–1896. Although he retired from exploration after his return to Norway, his techniques of polar travel and his innovations in equipment and clothing influenced a generation of subsequent <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> and <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a> expeditions.

Nansen studied zoology at the <a href="University%20of%20Oslo">Royal Frederick University</a> in <a href="Oslo">Christiania</a> and later worked as a curator at the <a href="University%20Museum%20of%20Bergen">University Museum of Bergen</a> where his research on the central nervous system of lower marine creatures earned him a doctorate and helped establish <a href="neuron">neuron</a> doctrine. Later, famed neuroscientist <a href="Santiago%20Ram%C3%B3n%20y%20Cajal">Santiago Ramón y Cajal</a> would win the 1906 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his research on the same subject, though "technical priority" for the theory is given to Nansen. After 1896 his main scientific interest switched to <a href="oceanography">oceanography</a>; in the course of his research he made many scientific cruises, mainly in the North Atlantic, and contributed to the development of modern oceanographic equipment. As one of his country's leading citizens, in 1905 Nansen spoke out for the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20union%20between%20Norway%20and%20Sweden">ending</a> of <a href="Norway%27s%20union%20with%20Sweden">Norway's union with Sweden</a>, and was instrumental in persuading <a href="Prince%20Carl%20of%20Denmark">Prince Carl of Denmark</a> to accept the throne of the newly independent Norway. Between 1906 and 1908 he served as the Norwegian representative in London, where he helped negotiate the Integrity Treaty that guaranteed Norway's independent status.

In the final decade of his life, Nansen devoted himself primarily to the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>, following his appointment in 1921 as the League's High Commissioner for Refugees. In 1922 he was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> for his work on behalf of the displaced victims of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and related conflicts. Among the initiatives he introduced was the "<a href="Nansen%20passport">Nansen passport</a>" for stateless persons, a certificate that used to be recognised by more than 50 countries. He worked on behalf of refugees until his sudden death in 1930, after which the League established the <a href="Nansen%20International%20Office%20for%20Refugees">Nansen International Office for Refugees</a> to ensure that his work continued. This office received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1938. His name is commemorated in numerous geographical features, particularly in the polar regions.

The Nansen family originated in Denmark. <a href="Hans%20Nansen">Hans Nansen</a> (1598–1667), a trader, was an early explorer of the <a href="White%20Sea">White Sea</a> region of the Arctic Ocean. In later life he settled in Copenhagen, becoming the city's "<a href="burgomaster">borgmester</a>" in 1654. Later generations of the family lived in Copenhagen until the mid-18th century, when Ancher Antoni Nansen moved to Norway (then in <a href="Denmark%E2%80%93Norway">a union with Denmark</a>). His son, Hans Leierdahl Nansen (1764–1821), was a magistrate first in the <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a> district, later in <a href="J%C3%A6ren">Jæren</a>. After Norway's separation from Denmark in 1814, he entered national political life as the representative for <a href="Stavanger">Stavanger</a> in the first <a href="Parliament%20of%20Norway">Storting</a>, and became a strong advocate of union with Sweden. After suffering a paralytic stroke in 1821 Hans Leierdahl Nansen died, leaving a four-year-old son, Baldur Fridtjof Nansen, the explorer's father.

Baldur was a lawyer without ambitions for public life, who became Reporter to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Norway">Supreme Court of Norway</a>. He married twice, the second time to Adelaide Johanne Thekla Isidore Bølling Wedel-Jarlsberg from <a href="B%C3%A6rum">Bærum</a>, a niece of <a href="Johan%20Caspar%20Herman%20Wedel-Jarlsberg">Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg</a> who had helped frame the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Norway">Norwegian constitution of 1814</a> and was later the Swedish king's Norwegian <a href="Governor-general%20of%20Norway">Viceroy</a>. Baldur and Adelaide settled at Store Frøen, an estate at Aker, a few kilometres north of Norway's capital city, <a href="Oslo">Christiania</a> (since renamed Oslo). The couple had three children; the first died in infancy, the second, born 10 October 1861, was Fridtjof Nansen.

Store Frøen's rural surroundings shaped the nature of Nansen's childhood. In the short summers the main activities were swimming and fishing, while in the autumn the chief pastime was hunting for game in the forests. The long winter months were devoted mainly to skiing, which Nansen began to practice at the age of two, on improvised skis. At the age of 10 he defied his parents and attempted the ski jump at the nearby <a href="Husebyrennet">Huseby</a> installation. This exploit had near-disastrous consequences, as on landing the skis dug deep into the snow, pitching the boy forward: "I, head first, described a fine arc in the air ... [W]hen I came down again I bored into the snow up to my waist. The boys thought I had broken my neck, but as soon as they saw there was life in me ... a shout of mocking laughter went up." Nansen's enthusiasm for skiing was undiminished, though as he records, his efforts were overshadowed by those of the skiers from the mountainous region of <a href="Telemark">Telemark</a>, where a <a href="Telemark%20skiing">new style of skiing</a> was being developed. "I saw this was the only way", wrote Nansen later.

At school, Nansen worked adequately without showing any particular aptitude. Studies took second place to sports, or to expeditions into the forests where he would live "like <a href="Robinson%20Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a>" for weeks at a time. Through such experiences Nansen developed a marked degree of self-reliance. He became an accomplished skier and a highly proficient <a href="Ice%20skating">skater</a>. Life was disrupted when, in the summer of 1877, Adelaide Nansen died suddenly. Distressed, Baldur Nansen sold the Store Frøen property and moved with his two sons to Christiania. Nansen's sporting prowess continued to develop; at 18 he broke the world one-mile (1.6 km) skating record, and in the following year won the national cross-country skiing championship, a feat he would repeat on 11 subsequent occasions.

In 1880 Nansen passed his university entrance examination, the "<a href="examen%20artium">examen artium</a>". He decided to study <a href="zoology">zoology</a>, claiming later that he chose the subject because he thought it offered the chance of a life in the open air. He began his studies at the <a href="Royal%20Frederick%20University">Royal Frederick University</a> in Christiania early in 1881.

Early in 1882 Nansen took "...the first fatal step that led me astray from the quiet life of science." Professor <a href="Robert%20Collett">Robert Collett</a> of the university's zoology department proposed that Nansen take a sea voyage, to study Arctic zoology at first hand. Nansen was enthusiastic, and made arrangements through a recent acquaintance, Captain Axel Krefting, commander of the <a href="seal%20hunting">sealer</a> "<a href="SS%20Viking">Viking</a>". The voyage began on 11 March 1882 and extended over the following five months. In the weeks before sealing started, Nansen was able to concentrate on scientific studies. From water samples he showed that, contrary to previous assumption, sea ice forms on the surface of the water rather than below. His readings also demonstrated that the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a> flows beneath a cold layer of surface water. Through the spring and early summer "Viking" roamed between Greenland and <a href="Svalbard">Spitsbergen</a> in search of seal herds. Nansen became an expert marksman, and on one day proudly recorded that his team had shot 200 seal. In July, "Viking" became trapped in the ice close to an unexplored section of the Greenland coast; Nansen longed to go ashore, but this was impossible. However, he began to develop the idea that the <a href="Greenland%20ice%20sheet">Greenland icecap</a> might be explored, or even crossed. On 17 July the ship broke free from the ice, and early in August was back in Norwegian waters.

Nansen did not resume formal studies at the university. Instead, on Collett's recommendation, he accepted a post as curator in the zoological department of the <a href="Bergen%20Museum">Bergen Museum</a>. He was to spend the next six years of his life there—apart from a six-month <a href="sabbatical">sabbatical</a> tour of Europe—working and studying with leading figures such as <a href="Gerhard%20Armauer%20Hansen">Gerhard Armauer Hansen</a>, the discoverer of the <a href="leprosy">leprosy</a> bacillus, and <a href="Daniel%20Cornelius%20Danielssen">Daniel Cornelius Danielssen</a>, the museum's director who had turned it from a backwater collection into a centre of scientific research and education. Nansen's chosen area of study was the then relatively unexplored field of <a href="neuroanatomy">neuroanatomy</a>, specifically the central nervous system of lower marine creatures. Before leaving for his sabbatical in February 1886 he published a paper summarising his research to date, in which he stated that "anastomoses or unions between the different ganglion cells" could not be demonstrated with certainty. This unorthodox view was confirmed by the simultaneous researches of the embryologist <a href="Wilhelm%20His%2C%20Sr.">Wilhelm His</a> and the psychiatrist <a href="August%20Forel">August Forel</a>. Nansen is considered the first Norwegian defender of the neuron theory, originally proposed by <a href="Santiago%20Ram%C3%B3n%20y%20Cajal">Santiago Ramón y Cajal</a>. His subsequent paper, "The Structure and Combination of Histological Elements of the Central Nervous System", published in 1887, became his doctoral thesis.

The idea of an expedition across the Greenland icecap grew in Nansen's mind throughout his Bergen years. In 1887, after the submission of his <a href="doctoral%20thesis">doctoral thesis</a>, he finally began organising this project. Before then, the two most significant penetrations of the Greenland interior had been those of <a href="Adolf%20Erik%20Nordenski%C3%B6ld">Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld</a> in 1883, and <a href="Robert%20Peary">Robert Peary</a> in 1886. Both had set out from <a href="Disko%20Bay">Disko Bay</a> on the western coast, and had travelled about eastward before turning back. By contrast, Nansen proposed to travel from east to west, ending rather than beginning his trek at Disko Bay. A party setting out from the inhabited west coast would, he reasoned, have to make a return trip, as no ship could be certain of reaching the dangerous east coast and picking them up. By starting from the east—assuming that a landing could be made there—Nansen's would be a one-way journey towards a populated area. The party would have no line of retreat to a safe base; the only way to go would be forward, a situation that fitted Nansen's philosophy completely.

Nansen rejected the complex organisation and heavy manpower of other Arctic ventures, and instead planned his expedition for a small party of six. Supplies would be <a href="manhauling">manhauled</a> on specially designed lightweight sledges. Much of the equipment, including sleeping bags, clothing and cooking stoves, also needed to be designed from scratch. These plans received a generally poor reception in the press; one critic had no doubt that "if [the] scheme be attempted in its present form ... the chances are ten to one that he will ... uselessly throw his own and perhaps others' lives away". The Norwegian parliament refused to provide financial support, believing that such a potentially risky undertaking should not be encouraged. The project was eventually launched with a donation from a Danish businessman, Augustin Gamél; the rest came mainly from small contributions from Nansen's countrymen, through a fundraising effort organised by students at the university.

Despite the adverse publicity, Nansen received numerous applications from would-be adventurers. He wanted expert skiers, and attempted to recruit from the skiers of Telemark, but his approaches were rebuffed. Nordenskiöld had advised Nansen that <a href="Sami%20people">Sami people</a>, from <a href="Finland">Finland</a> in the far north of Norway, were expert snow travellers, so Nansen recruited a pair, <a href="Samuel%20Balto">Samuel Balto</a> and <a href="Ole%20Nielsen%20Ravna">Ole Nielsen Ravna</a>. The remaining places went to <a href="Otto%20Sverdrup">Otto Sverdrup</a>, a former sea-captain who had more recently worked as a forester; <a href="Oluf%20Christian%20Dietrichson">Oluf Christian Dietrichson</a>, an army officer, and <a href="Kristian%20Kristiansen%20%28explorer%29">Kristian Kristiansen</a>, an acquaintance of Sverdrup's. All had experience of outdoor life in extreme conditions, and were experienced skiers. Just before the party's departure, Nansen attended a formal examination at the university, which had agreed to receive his doctoral thesis. In accordance with custom he was required to defend his work before appointed examiners acting as <a href="devil%27s%20advocate">"devil's advocates"</a>. He left before knowing the outcome of this process.

The sealer <a href="Jason%20%28ship%29">"Jason"</a> picked up Nansen's party on 3 June 1888 from the Icelandic port of <a href="%C3%8Dsafj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur">Ísafjörður</a>. They sighted the Greenland coast a week later, but thick <a href="drift%20ice">pack ice</a> hindered progress. With the coast still away, Nansen decided to launch the small boats. They were within sight of <a href="Sermilik">Sermilik Fjord</a> on 17 July; Nansen believed it would offer a route up the icecap.

The expedition left "Jason" "in good spirits and with the highest hopes of a fortunate result." Days of extreme frustration followed as they drifted south. Weather and sea conditions prevented them from reaching the shore. They spent most time camping on the ice itself—it was too dangerous to launch the boats.

By 29 July, they found themselves south of the point where they left the ship. That day they finally reached land but were too far south to begin the crossing. Nansen ordered the team back into the boats after a brief rest and to begin rowing north. The party battled northward along the coast through the ice floes for the next 12 days. They encountered a large Eskimo encampment on the first day, near Cape Steen Bille. Occasional contacts with the nomadic native population continued as the journey progressed.

The party reached <a href="Umivik%20Bay">Umivik Bay</a> on 11 August, after covering . Nansen decided they needed to begin the crossing. Although they were still far south of his intended starting place; the season was becoming too advanced. After they landed at Umivik, they spent the next four days preparing for their journey. They set out on the evening of 15 August, heading north-west towards <a href="Christianhaab">Christianhaab</a> on the western shore of Disko Bay— away.

Over the next few days, the party struggled to ascend. The inland ice had a treacherous surface with many hidden <a href="crevasses">crevasses</a> and the weather was bad. Progress stopped for three days because of violent storms and continuous rain one time. The last ship was due to leave Christianhaab by mid-September. They would not be able to reach it in time, Nansen concluded on 26 August. He ordered a change of course due west, towards <a href="Nuuk">Godthaab</a>; a shorter journey by at least . The rest of the party, according to Nansen, "hailed the change of plan with acclamation." 
They continued climbing until 11 September and reached a height of above sea level. Temperatures on the icecap summit of the icecap dropped to at night. From then on the downward slope made travelling easier. Yet, the terrain was rugged and the weather remained hostile. Progress was slow: fresh snowfalls made dragging the sledges like pulling them through sand.

On 26 September, they battled their way down the edge of a <a href="fjord">fjord</a> westward towards Godthaab. Sverdrup constructed a makeshift boat out of parts of the sledges, willows, and their tent. Three days later, Nansen and Sverdrup began the last stage of the journey; rowing down the fjord.

On 3 October, they reached <a href="Godthaab">Godthaab</a>, where the Danish town representative greeted them. He first informed Nansen that he secured his doctorate, a matter that "could not have been more remote from [Nansen's] thoughts at that moment." The team accomplished their crossing in 49 days. Throughout the journey, they maintained meteorological and geographical and other records relating to the previously unexplored interior.

The rest of the team arrived in Godthaab on 12 October. Nansen soon learned no ship was likely to call at Godthaab until the following spring. Still, they were able to send letters back to Norway via a boat leaving <a href="Ivigtut">Ivigtut</a> at the end of October. He and his party spent the next seven months in Greenland. On 15 April 1889, the Danish ship "Hvidbjørnen" finally entered the harbour. Nansen recorded: "It was not without sorrow that we left this place and these people, among whom we had enjoyed ourselves so well."

"Hvidbjørnen" reached Copenhagen on 21 May 1889. News of the crossing had preceded its arrival, and Nansen and his companions were feted as heroes. This welcome, however, was dwarfed by the reception in Christiania a week later, when crowds of between thirty and forty thousand—a third of the city's population—thronged the streets as the party made its way to the first of a series of receptions. The interest and enthusiasm generated by the expedition's achievement led directly to the formation that year of the <a href="Norwegian%20Geographical%20Society">Norwegian Geographical Society</a>.

Nansen accepted the position of curator of the Royal Frederick University's zoology collection, a post which carried a salary but involved no duties; the university was satisfied by the association with the explorer's name. Nansen's main task in the following weeks was writing his account of the expedition, but he found time late in June to visit London, where he met <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">the Prince of Wales</a> (the future King Edward VII), and addressed a meeting of the <a href="Royal%20Geographical%20Society">Royal Geographical Society</a> (RGS).

The RGS president, Sir <a href="Mountstuart%20Elphinstone%20Grant%20Duff">Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff</a>, said that Nansen has claimed "the foremost place amongst northern travellers", and later awarded him the Society's prestigious <a href="Gold%20Medal%20%28RGS%29">Founder's Medal</a>. This was one of many honours Nansen received from institutions all over Europe. He was invited by a group of Australians to lead an expedition to Antarctica, but declined, believing that Norway's interests would be better served by a North Pole conquest.

On 11 August 1889 Nansen announced his engagement to <a href="Eva%20Sars">Eva Sars</a>, the daughter of <a href="Michael%20Sars">Michael Sars</a>, a zoology professor who had died when Eva was 11 years old. The couple had met some years previously, at the skiing resort of <a href="Frognerseteren">Frognerseteren</a>, where Nansen recalled seeing "two feet sticking out of the snow". Eva was three years older than Nansen, and despite the evidence of this first meeting, was an accomplished skier. She was also a celebrated classical singer who had been coached in Berlin by <a href="D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9e%20Art%C3%B4t">Désirée Artôt</a>, one-time paramour of <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>. The engagement surprised many; since Nansen had previously expressed himself forcefully against the institution of marriage, Otto Sverdrup assumed he had read the message wrongly. The wedding took place on 6 September 1889, less than a month after the engagement.

Nansen first began to consider the possibility of reaching the North Pole after reading meteorologist <a href="Henrik%20Mohn">Henrik Mohn</a>'s theory on <a href="polar%20drift">polar drift</a> in 1884. Artefacts found on the coast of Greenland were identified to have come from the <a href="Jeannette%20Expedition">"Jeannette" expedition</a>. In June 1881, was crushed and sunk off the Siberian coast—the opposite side of the Arctic Ocean. Mohn surmised the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an ocean current from east to west, all the way across the polar sea and possibly over the pole itself.

The idea remained fixated in Nansen's mind for the next couple of years. He developed a detailed plan for a polar venture after his triumphant return from Greenland. He made his idea public in February 1890, at a meeting of the newly-formed Norwegian Geographical Society. Previous expeditions, he argued, approached the North Pole from the west and failed because they were working against the prevailing east-west current; the secret was to work with the current. 

A workable plan would require a sturdy and manoeuvrable small ship, capable of carrying fuel and provisions for twelve men for five years. This ship would enter the ice pack close to the approximate location of "Jeannette's" sinking, drifting west with the current towards the pole and beyond it—eventually reaching the sea between Greenland and Spitsbergen.

Experienced polar explorers were dismissive: <a href="Adolphus%20Greely">Adolphus Greely</a> called the idea "an illogical scheme of self-destruction". Equally dismissive were <a href="Allen%20Young">Sir Allen Young</a>, a veteran of the searches for <a href="Franklin%27s%20lost%20expedition">Franklin's lost expedition</a>, and <a href="Joseph%20Dalton%20Hooker">Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker</a>, who had sailed to the Antarctic on the <a href="Ross%20expedition">Ross expedition</a>. Nansen still managed to secure a grant from the Norwegian parliament after an impassioned speech. Additional funding was secured through a national appeal for private donations.

Nansen chose naval engineer <a href="Colin%20Archer">Colin Archer</a> to design and build a ship. Archer designed an extraordinarily sturdy vessel with an intricate system of crossbeams and braces of the toughest oak timbers. Its rounded hull was designed to push the ship upwards when beset by pack ice. Speed and manoeuvrability were to be secondary to its ability as a safe and warm shelter during their predicted confinement.

The length-to-beam ratio— and —gave it a stubby appearance, justified by Archer: "A ship that is built with exclusive regard to its suitability for [Nansen's] object must differ essentially from any known vessel." It was christened "<a href="Fram">Fram</a>" and launched on 6 October 1892.

Nansen selected a party of twelve from thousands of applicants. <a href="Otto%20Sverdrup">Otto Sverdrup</a>, who took part in Nansen's earlier Greenland expedition was appointed as the expedition's second-in-command. Competition was so fierce that army lieutenant and dog-driving expert <a href="Hjalmar%20Johansen">Hjalmar Johansen</a> signed on as ship's stoker, the only position still available.

"<a href="Fram">Fram</a>" left <a href="Oslo">Christiania</a> on 24 June 1893, cheered on by thousands of well-wishers. After a slow journey around the coast, the final port of call was <a href="Vard%C3%B8%20%28town%29">Vardø</a>, in the far north-east of Norway. "Fram" left Vardø on 21 July, following the <a href="North-East%20Passage">North-East Passage</a> route pioneered by Nordenskiöld in 1878–1879, along the northern coast of Siberia. Progress was impeded by fog and ice conditions in the mainly uncharted seas.

The crew also experienced the <a href="dead%20water">dead water</a> phenomenon, where a ship's forward progress is impeded by friction caused by a layer of fresh water lying on top of heavier salt water. Nevertheless, <a href="Cape%20Chelyuskin">Cape Chelyuskin</a>, the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass, was passed on 10 September.

Heavy <a href="drift%20ice">pack ice</a> was sighted ten days later at around latitude 78°N, as "Fram" approached the area in which was crushed. Nansen followed the line of the pack northwards to a position recorded as , before ordering engines stopped and the rudder raised. From this point "Fram's" drift began. The first weeks in the ice were frustrating, as the drift moved unpredictably; sometimes north, sometimes south.

By 19 November, "Fram's" latitude was south of that at which she had entered the ice. Only after the turn of the year, in January 1894, did the northerly direction become generally settled; the 80°N mark was finally passed on 22 March. Nansen calculated that, at this rate, it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. As the ship's northerly progress continued at a rate rarely above a kilometre and a half per day, Nansen began privately to consider a new plan—a <a href="dog%20sled">dog sled</a>ge journey towards the pole. With this in mind, he began to practice dog-driving, making many experimental journeys over the ice. 

In November, Nansen announced his plan: when the ship passed latitude 83°N, he and Hjalmar Johansen would leave the ship with the dogs and make for the pole while "Fram", under Sverdrup, continued its drift until it emerged from the ice in the North Atlantic. After reaching the pole, Nansen and Johansen would make for the nearest known land, the recently discovered and sketchily mapped <a href="Franz%20Josef%20Land">Franz Josef Land</a>. They would then cross to <a href="Svalbard">Spitzbergen</a> where they would find a ship to take them home.

The crew spent the rest of the winter of 1894 preparing clothing and equipment for the forthcoming sledge journey. <a href="Kayaks">Kayaks</a> were built, to be carried on the sledges until needed for the crossing of open water. Preparations were interrupted early in January when violent tremors shook the ship. The crew disembarked, fearing the vessel would be crushed, but "Fram" proved herself equal to the danger. On 8 January 1895, the ship's position was 83°34′N, above Greely's <a href="Farthest%20North">previous record</a> of 83°24′N.

With the ship's latitude at 84°4′N and after two false starts, Nansen and Johansen began their journey on 14 March 1895. Nansen allowed 50 days to cover the to the pole, an average daily journey of . After a week of travel, a <a href="sextant">sextant</a> observation indicated they averaged per day, which put them ahead of schedule. However, uneven surfaces made skiing more difficult, and their speeds slowed. They also realised they were marching against a southerly drift, and that distances travelled did not necessarily equate to distance progressed. 

On 3 April, Nansen began to doubt whether the pole was attainable. Unless their speed improved, their food would not last them to the pole and back to <a href="Franz%20Josef%20Land">Franz Josef Land</a>. He confided in his diary: "I have become more and more convinced we ought to turn before time." Four days later, after making camp, he observed the way ahead was "... a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon." Nansen recorded their latitude as 86°13′6″N—almost three degrees beyond the previous record—and decided to turn around and head back south.

At first Nansen and Johansen made good progress south, but suffered a serious setback on 13 April, when in his eagerness to break camp, he had forgotten to wind both of their <a href="Marine%20chronometer">chronometer</a>s, which made it impossible to calculate their longitude and accurately navigate to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches based on Nansen's guess they were at 86°E. From then on were uncertain of their true position. The tracks of an <a href="Arctic%20fox">Arctic fox</a> were observed towards the end of April. It was the first trace of a living creature other than their dogs since they left "Fram". They soon saw bear tracks and by the end of May saw evidence of nearby seals, gulls and whales.
On 31 May, Nansen calculated they were only from <a href="Cape%20Fligely">Cape Fligely</a>, Franz Josef Land's northernmost point. Travel conditions worsened as increasingly warmer weather caused the ice to break up. On 22 June, the pair decided to rest on a stable <a href="Drift%20ice">ice floe</a> while they repaired their equipment and gathered strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained on the floe for a month.

The day after leaving this camp, Nansen recorded: "At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!" Whether this still-distant land was Franz Josef Land or a new discovery they did not know—they had only a rough sketch map to guide them. The edge of the pack ice was reached on 6 August and they shot the last of their dogs—the weakest of which they killed regularly to feed the others since 24 April. The two kayaks were lashed together, a sail was raised, and they made for the land.

It soon became clear this land was part of an archipelago. As they moved southwards, Nansen tentatively identified a headland as Cape Felder on the western edge of Franz Josef Land. Towards the end of August, as the weather grew colder and travel became increasingly difficult, Nansen decided to camp for the winter. In a sheltered cove, with stones and moss for building materials, the pair erected a hut which was to be their home for the next eight months. With ready supplies of bear, walrus and seal to keep their larder stocked, their principal enemy was not hunger but inactivity. After muted Christmas and New Year celebrations, in slowly improving weather, they began to prepare to leave their refuge, but it was 19 May 1896 before they were able to resume their journey.

On 17 June, during a stop for repairs after the kayaks had been attacked by a <a href="walrus">walrus</a>, Nansen thought he heard a dog barking as well as human voices. He went to investigate, and a few minutes later saw the figure of a man approaching. It was the British explorer <a href="Frederick%20George%20Jackson">Frederick Jackson</a>, who was leading an expedition to Franz Josef Land and was camped at <a href="Cape%20Flora">Cape Flora</a> on nearby <a href="Northbrook%20Island">Northbrook Island</a>. The two were equally astonished by their encounter; after some awkward hesitation Jackson asked: "You are Nansen, aren't you?", and received the reply "Yes, I am Nansen."

Johansen was picked up and the pair were taken to Cape Flora where, during the following weeks, they recuperated from their ordeal. Nansen later wrote that he could "still scarcely grasp" their sudden change of fortune; had it not been for the walrus attack that caused the delay, the two parties might have been unaware of each other's existence.
On 7 August, Nansen and Johansen boarded Jackson's supply ship "Windward", and sailed for Vardø where they arrived on the 13th. They were greeted by Hans Mohn, the originator of the polar drift theory, who was in the town by chance. The world was quickly informed by telegram of Nansen's safe return, but as yet there was no news of "Fram".

Taking the weekly mail steamer south, Nansen and Johansen reached <a href="Hammerfest">Hammerfest</a> on 18 August, where they learned that "Fram" had been sighted. She had emerged from the ice north and west of Spitsbergen, as Nansen had predicted, and was now on her way to Tromsø. She had not passed over the pole, nor exceeded Nansen's northern mark. Without delay Nansen and Johansen sailed for Tromsø, where they were reunited with their comrades.

The homeward voyage to Christiania was a series of triumphant receptions at every port. On 9 September, "Fram" was escorted into Christiania's harbour and welcomed by the largest crowds the city had ever seen. The crew were received by King Oscar, and Nansen, reunited with family, remained at the palace for several days as special guests. Tributes arrived from all over the world; typical was that from the British mountaineer <a href="Edward%20Whymper">Edward Whymper</a>, who wrote that Nansen had made "almost as great an advance as has been accomplished by all other voyages in the nineteenth century put together".

Nansen's first task on his return was to write his account of the voyage. This he did remarkably quickly, producing 300,000 words of Norwegian text by November 1896; the English translation, titled "Farthest North", was ready in January 1897. The book was an instant success, and secured Nansen's long-term financial future. Nansen included without comment the one significant adverse criticism of his conduct, that of Greely, who had written in "<a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>" on Nansen's decision to leave "Fram" and strike for the pole: "It passes comprehension how Nansen could have thus deviated from the most sacred duty devolving on the commander of a naval expedition."

During the 20 years following his return from the Arctic, Nansen devoted most of his energies to scientific work. In 1897 he accepted a professorship in zoology at the <a href="University%20of%20Oslo">Royal Frederick University</a>, which gave him a base from which he could tackle the major task of editing the reports of the scientific results of the "Fram" expedition. This was a much more arduous task than writing the expedition narrative. The results were eventually published in six volumes, and according to a later polar scientist, <a href="Robert%20Neal%20Rudmose-Brown">Robert Rudmose-Brown</a>, "were to Arctic oceanography what the <a href="Challenger%20expedition">"Challenger" expedition</a> results had been to the oceanography of other oceans."

In 1900, Nansen became director of the Christiania-based International Laboratory for North Sea Research, and helped found the <a href="International%20Council%20for%20the%20Exploration%20of%20the%20Sea">International Council for the Exploration of the Sea</a>. Through his connection with the latter body, in the summer of 1900 Nansen embarked on his first visit to Arctic waters since the "Fram" expedition, a cruise to Iceland and Jan Mayen Land on the oceanographic research vessel "Michael Sars", named after Eva's father. Shortly after his return he learned that his Farthest North record had been passed, by members of <a href="Luigi%20Amedeo%2C%20Duke%20of%20the%20Abruzzi">the Duke of the Abruzzi</a>'s Italian expedition. They had reached 86°34′N on 24 April 1900, in an attempt to reach the North Pole from Franz Josef Land. Nansen received the news philosophically: "What is the value of having goals for their own sake? They all vanish ... it is merely a question of time."

Nansen was now considered an oracle by all would-be explorers of the north and south polar regions. Abruzzi had consulted him, as had the Belgian <a href="Adrien%20de%20Gerlache">Adrien de Gerlache</a>, each of whom took expeditions to the Antarctic. Although Nansen refused to meet his own countryman and fellow-explorer <a href="Carsten%20Borchgrevink">Carsten Borchgrevink</a> (whom he considered a fraud), he gave advice to <a href="Robert%20Falcon%20Scott">Robert Falcon Scott</a> on polar equipment and transport, prior to the 1901–04 <a href="Discovery%20Expedition">"Discovery" expedition</a>. At one point Nansen seriously considered leading a South Pole expedition himself, and asked Colin Archer to design two ships. However, these plans remained on the drawing board.

By 1901 Nansen's family had expanded considerably. A daughter, Liv, had been born just before "Fram" set out; a son, Kåre was born in 1897 followed by a daughter, Irmelin, in 1900 and a second son <a href="Odd%20Nansen">Odd</a> in 1901. The family home, which Nansen had built in 1891 from the profits of his Greenland expedition book, was now too small. Nansen acquired a plot of land in the <a href="Lysaker">Lysaker</a> district and built, substantially to his own design, a large and imposing house which combined some of the characteristics of an English <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> with features from the <a href="Renaissance%20architecture">Italian renaissance</a>.

The house was ready for occupation by April 1902; Nansen called it "<a href="Polh%C3%B8gda">Polhøgda</a>" (in English "polar heights"), and it remained his home for the rest of his life. A fifth and final child, son Asmund, was born at Polhøgda in 1903.

<a href="Union%20between%20Sweden%20and%20Norway">The union between Norway and Sweden</a>, imposed by the Great Powers in 1814, had been under considerable strain through the 1890s, the chief issue in question being Norway's rights to its own <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29">consular service</a>. Nansen, although not by inclination a politician, had spoken out on the issue on several occasions in defence of Norway's interests. It seemed, early in the 20th century that agreement between the two countries might be possible, but hopes were dashed when negotiations broke down in February 1905. The Norwegian government fell, and was replaced by one led by <a href="Christian%20Michelsen">Christian Michelsen</a>, whose programme was one of separation from Sweden.

In February and March Nansen published a series of newspaper articles which placed him firmly in the separatist camp. The new prime minister wanted Nansen in the cabinet, but Nansen had no political ambitions. However, at Michelsen's request he went to Berlin and then to London where, in a letter to "The Times", he presented Norway's legal case for a separate consular service to the English-speaking world. On 17 May 1905, Norway's Constitution Day, Nansen addressed a large crowd in Christiania, saying: "Now have all ways of retreat been closed. Now remains only one path, the way forward, perhaps through difficulties and hardships, but forward for our country, to a free Norway". He also wrote a book, "Norway and the Union with Sweden", specifically to promote Norway's case abroad.

On 23 May the Storting passed the Consulate Act establishing a separate consular service. King Oscar refused his assent; on 27 May the Norwegian cabinet resigned, but the king would not recognise this step. On 7 June the Storting unilaterally announced that the union with Sweden was dissolved. In a tense situation the Swedish government agreed to Norway's request that the dissolution should be put to a referendum of the Norwegian people. This was held on 13 August 1905 and resulted in an overwhelming vote for separation, at which point King Oscar relinquished the crown of Norway while retaining the Swedish throne. A second referendum, held in November, determined that the new independent state should be a <a href="monarchy">monarchy</a> rather than a republic. In anticipation of this, Michelsen's government had been considering the suitability of various princes as candidates for the Norwegian throne. Faced with King Oscar's refusal to allow anyone from his own <a href="House%20of%20Bernadotte">House of Bernadotte</a> to accept the crown, the favoured choice was <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">Prince Charles of Denmark</a>. In July 1905 Michelsen sent Nansen to Copenhagen on a secret mission to persuade Charles to accept the Norwegian throne. Nansen was successful; shortly after the second referendum Charles was proclaimed king, taking the name Haakon VII. He and his wife, the British princess <a href="Maud%20of%20Wales">Maud</a>, were crowned in the <a href="Nidaros%20Cathedral">Nidaros Cathedral</a> in <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a> on 22 June 1906.

In April 1906 Nansen was appointed Norway's first <a href="Minister%20%28diplomacy%29">Minister</a> in London. His main task was to work with representatives of the major European powers on an Integrity Treaty which would guarantee Norway's position. Nansen was popular in England, and got on well with King Edward, though he found court functions and diplomatic duties disagreeable; "frivolous and boring" was his description. However, he was able to pursue his geographical and scientific interests through contacts with the Royal Geographical Society and other learned bodies. The Treaty was signed on 2 November 1907, and Nansen considered his task complete. Resisting the pleas of, among others, King Edward that he should remain in London, on 15 November Nansen resigned his post. A few weeks later, still in England as the king's guest at <a href="Sandringham%20House">Sandringham</a>, Nansen received word that Eva was seriously ill with <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. On 8 December he set out for home, but before he reached Polhøgda he learned, from a telegram, that Eva had died.

After a period of mourning, Nansen returned to London. He had been persuaded by his government to rescind his resignation until after King Edward's state visit to Norway in April 1908. His formal retirement from the diplomatic service was dated 1 May 1908, the same day on which his university professorship was changed from zoology to oceanography. This new designation reflected the general character of Nansen's more recent scientific interests.

In 1905, he had supplied the Swedish physicist <a href="Walfrid%20Ekman">Walfrid Ekman</a> with the data which established the principle in oceanography known as the <a href="Ekman%20spiral">Ekman spiral</a>. Based on Nansen's observations of ocean currents recorded during the "Fram" expedition, Ekman concluded that the effect of wind on the sea's surface produced currents which "formed something like a spiral staircase, down towards the depths".

In 1909 Nansen combined with <a href="Bj%C3%B8rn%20Helland-Hansen">Bjørn Helland-Hansen</a> to publish an academic paper, "The Norwegian Sea: its Physical Oceanography", based on the "Michael Sars" voyage of 1900. Nansen had by now retired from polar exploration, the decisive step being his release of "Fram" to fellow Norwegian <a href="Roald%20Amundsen">Roald Amundsen</a>, who was planning a North Pole expedition. When Amundsen made his controversial change of plan and <a href="Amundsen%27s%20South%20Pole%20expedition">set out for the South Pole</a>, Nansen stood by him.

Between 1910 and 1914, Nansen participated in several oceanographic voyages. In 1910, aboard the Norwegian naval vessel "Fridtjof", he carried out researches in the northern Atlantic, and in 1912 he took his own yacht, "Veslemøy", to <a href="Bear%20Island%20%28Norway%29">Bear Island</a> and <a href="Spitsbergen">Spitsbergen</a>. The main objective of the "Veslemøy" cruise was the investigation of <a href="salinity">salinity</a> in the North Polar Basin. One of Nansen's lasting contributions to oceanography was his work designing instruments and equipment; the "<a href="Nansen%20bottle">Nansen bottle</a>" for taking deep water samples remained in use into the 21st century, in a version updated by <a href="Shale%20Niskin">Shale Niskin</a>.

At the request of the Royal Geographical Society, Nansen began work on a study of Arctic discoveries, which developed into a two-volume history of the exploration of the northern regions up to the beginning of the 16th century. This was published in 1911 as "Nord i Tåkeheimen" ("In Northern Mists"). That year he renewed an acquaintance with <a href="Kathleen%20Scott">Kathleen Scott</a>, wife of Robert Falcon Scott whose <a href="Terra%20Nova%20Expedition">Terra Nova Expedition</a> had sailed for Antarctica in 1910.

Biographer <a href="Roland%20Huntford">Roland Huntford</a> has asserted, without any compelling evidence, that Nansen and Kathleen Scott had a brief love affair. <a href="Louisa%20Young">Louisa Young</a>, in her biography of Lady Scott, refutes the claim. Many women were attracted to Nansen, and he had a reputation as a womaniser. His personal life was troubled around this time; in January 1913 he received news of the suicide of Hjalmar Johansen, who had returned in disgrace from Amundsen's successful South Pole expedition. In March 1913, Nansen's youngest son Asmund died after a long illness.

In the summer of 1913, Nansen travelled to the Kara Sea, by the invitation of <a href="Jonas%20Lied">Jonas Lied</a>, as part of a delegation investigating a possible trade route between Western Europe and the Siberian interior. The party then took a steamer up the <a href="Yenisei%20River">Yenisei River</a> to <a href="Krasnoyarsk">Krasnoyarsk</a>, and travelled on the <a href="Trans-Siberian%20Railway">Trans-Siberian Railway</a> to <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> before turning for home. Nansen published a report from the trip in "Through Siberia". The life and culture of the Russian peoples aroused in Nansen an interest and sympathy he would carry through to his later life. Immediately before the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, Nansen joined Helland-Hansen in an oceanographical cruise in eastern Atlantic waters.

On the outbreak of war in 1914, Norway declared its neutrality, alongside Sweden and Denmark. Nansen was appointed as the president of the Norwegian Union of Defence, but had few official duties, and continued with his professional work as far as circumstances permitted. As the war progressed, the loss of Norway's overseas trade led to acute shortages of food in the country, which became critical in April 1917, when the United States entered the war and placed extra restrictions on international trade. Nansen was dispatched to Washington by the Norwegian government; after months of discussion, he secured food and other supplies in return for the introduction of a rationing system. When his government hesitated over the deal, he signed the agreement on his own initiative.

Within a few months of the war's end in November 1918, a draft agreement had been accepted by the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference</a> to create a <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>, as a means of resolving disputes between nations by peaceful means. The foundation of the League at this time was providential as far as Nansen was concerned, giving him a new outlet for his restless energy. He became president of the Norwegian League of Nations Society, and although the Scandinavian nations with their traditions of neutrality initially held themselves aloof, his advocacy helped to ensure that Norway became a full member of the League in 1920, and he became one of its three delegates to the League's General Assembly.

In April 1920, at the League's request, Nansen began organising the repatriation of around half a million prisoners of war, stranded in various parts of the world. Of these, 300,000 were in Russia which, gripped by revolution and civil war, had little interest in their fate. Nansen was able to report to the Assembly in November 1920 that around 200,000 men had been returned to their homes. "Never in my life", he said, "have I been brought into touch with so formidable an amount of suffering."

Nansen continued this work for a further two years until, in his final report to the Assembly in 1922, he was able to state that 427,886 prisoners had been repatriated to around 30 different countries. In paying tribute to his work, the responsible committee recorded that the story of his efforts "would contain tales of heroic endeavour worthy of those in the accounts of the crossing of Greenland and the great Arctic voyage."

Even before this work was complete, Nansen was involved in a further humanitarian effort. On 1 September 1921, prompted by the British delegate <a href="Philip%20Noel-Baker">Philip Noel-Baker</a>, he accepted the post of the League's High Commissioner for Refugees. His main brief was the resettlement of around two million Russian refugees displaced by the upheavals of the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20%281917%29">Russian Revolution</a>.

At the same time he tried to tackle the urgent problem of <a href="Russian%20famine%20of%201921">famine in Russia</a>; following a widespread failure of crops around 30 million people were threatened with starvation and death. Despite Nansen's pleas on behalf of the starving, Russia's revolutionary government was feared and distrusted internationally, and the League was reluctant to come to its peoples' aid. Nansen had to rely largely on fundraising from private organisations, and his efforts met with limited success. Later he was to express himself bitterly on the matter:

A major problem impeding Nansen's work on behalf of refugees was that most of them lacked documentary proof of identity or nationality. Without legal status in their country of refuge, their lack of papers meant they were unable to go anywhere else. To overcome this, Nansen devised a document that became known as the "<a href="Nansen%20passport">Nansen passport</a>", a form of identity for <a href="Statelessness">stateless persons</a> that was in time recognised by more than 50 governments, and which allowed refugees to cross borders legally. Although the passport was created initially for refugees from Russia, it was extended to cover other groups.

While attending the <a href="Conference%20of%20Lausanne">Conference of Lausanne</a> in November 1922, Nansen learned that he had been awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> for 1922. The citation referred to "his work for the repatriation of the prisoners of war, his work for the Russian refugees, his work to bring succour to the millions of Russians afflicted by famine, and finally his present work for the refugees in Asia Minor and Thrace". Nansen donated the prize money to international relief efforts.

After the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281919%E2%80%931922%29">Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922</a>, Nansen travelled to <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> to negotiate the resettlement of hundreds of thousands of refugees, mainly ethnic Greeks who had fled from Turkey after the defeat of the Greek Army. The impoverished Greek state was unable to take them in, and so Nansen devised a scheme for a <a href="Population%20exchange%20between%20Greece%20and%20Turkey">population exchange</a> whereby half a million Turks in Greece were returned to Turkey, with full financial compensation, while further loans facilitated the absorption of the refugee Greeks into their homeland. Despite some controversy over the principle of a population exchange, the plan was implemented successfully over a period of several years.

From 1925 onwards, Nansen devoted much time trying to help Armenian refugees, victims of <a href="Armenian%20genocide">Armenian genocide</a> at the hands of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> during the First World War and further ill-treatment thereafter. His goal was the establishment of a national home for these refugees, within the borders of <a href="Armenian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Soviet Armenia</a>. His main assistant in this endeavour was <a href="Vidkun%20Quisling">Vidkun Quisling</a>, the future <a href="Collaboration%20with%20the%20Axis%20Powers%20during%20World%20War%20II">Nazi collaborator</a> and head of a <a href="Quisling%20regime">Norwegian puppet government</a> during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

After visiting the region, Nansen presented the Assembly with a modest plan for the irrigation of on which 15,000 refugees could be settled. The plan ultimately failed, because even with Nansen's unremitting advocacy the money to finance the scheme was not forthcoming. Despite this failure, his reputation among the Armenian people remains high.

Nansen wrote "Armenia and the Near East" (1923) wherein he describes the plight of the Armenians in the wake of losing its independence to the Soviet Union. The book was translated into many languages. After his visit to Armenia, Nansen wrote two additional books: "Across Armenia" (1927) and "Through the Caucasus to the Volga" (1930).

Within the League's Assembly, Nansen spoke out on many issues besides those related to refugees. He believed that the Assembly gave the smaller countries such as Norway a "unique opportunity for speaking in the councils of the world." He believed that the extent of the League's success in reducing armaments would be the greatest test of its credibility. He was a signatory to the <a href="1926%20Slavery%20Convention">Slavery Convention</a> of 25 September 1926, which sought to outlaw the use of forced labour. He supported a settlement of the <a href="World%20War%20I%20reparations">post-war reparations</a> issue and championed Germany's membership of the League, which was granted in September 1926 after intensive preparatory work by Nansen.

On 17 January 1919 Nansen married Sigrun Munthe, a long-time friend with whom he had had a love affair in 1905, while Eva was still alive. The marriage was resented by the Nansen children, and proved unhappy; an acquaintance writing of them in the 1920s said Nansen appeared unbearably miserable and Sigrun steeped in hate.

Nansen's League of Nations commitments through the 1920s meant that he was mostly absent from Norway, and was able to devote little time to scientific work. Nevertheless, he continued to publish occasional papers. He entertained the hope that he might travel to the North Pole by airship, but could not raise sufficient funding. In any event he was forestalled in this ambition by Amundsen, who flew over the pole in <a href="Umberto%20Nobile">Umberto Nobile</a>'s airship "<a href="Norge%20%28airship%29">Norge</a>" in May 1926. Two years later Nansen broadcast a memorial oration to Amundsen, who had disappeared in the Arctic while organising a rescue party for Nobile whose airship had crashed during a second polar voyage. Nansen said of Amundsen: "He found an unknown grave under the clear sky of the icy world, with the whirring of the wings of eternity through space."
In 1926 Nansen was elected <a href="Rector%20of%20the%20University%20of%20St%20Andrews">Rector of the University of St Andrews</a> in Scotland, the first foreigner to hold this largely honorary position. He used the occasion of his inaugural address to review his life and philosophy, and to deliver a call to the youth of the next generation. He ended:

We all have a Land of Beyond to seek in our life—what more can we ask? Our part is to find the trail that leads to it. A long trail, a hard trail, maybe; but the call comes to us, and we have to go. Rooted deep in the nature of every one of us is the spirit of adventure, the call of the wild—vibrating under all our actions, making life deeper and higher and nobler.

Nansen largely avoided involvement in domestic Norwegian politics, but in 1924 he was persuaded by the long-retired former Prime Minister Christian Michelsen to take part in a new anti-communist political grouping, the <a href="Fatherland%20League%20%28Norway%29">Fatherland League</a>. There were fears in Norway that should the <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a>-oriented <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28Norway%29">Labour Party</a> gain power it would introduce a revolutionary programme. At the inaugural rally of the League in Oslo (as Christiania had now been renamed), Nansen declared: "To talk of the right of revolution in a society with full civil liberty, universal suffrage, equal treatment for everyone ... [is] idiotic nonsense." 

Following continued turmoil between the centre-right parties, there was even an independent petition in 1926 gaining some momentum that proposed for Nansen to head a centre-right <a href="national%20unity%20government">national unity government</a> on a <a href="balanced%20budget">balanced budget</a> program, an idea he did not reject. He was the headline speaker at the single largest Fatherland League rally with 15,000 attendees in Tønsberg in 1928. In 1929 he went on his final tour for the League on the ship "Stella Polaris", holding speeches from Bergen to Hammerfest.

In between his various duties and responsibilities, Nansen had continued to take skiing holidays when he could. In February 1930, aged 68, he took a short break in the mountains with two old friends, who noted that Nansen was slower than usual and appeared to tire easily. On his return to Oslo he was laid up for several months, with influenza and later <a href="phlebitis">phlebitis</a>, and was visited on his sickbed by <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">King Haakon VII</a>.

Nansen was a close friend of a clergyman named Wilhelm. Nansen himself was an atheist.

Nansen died of a heart attack on 13 May 1930. He was given a non-religious <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> before cremation, after which his ashes were laid under a tree at Polhøgda. Nansen's daughter Liv recorded that there were no speeches, just music: <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>'s "<a href="Death%20and%20the%20Maiden%20Quartet">Death and the Maiden</a>", which Eva used to sing. 

In his lifetime and thereafter, Nansen received honours and recognition from many countries. Among the many tributes paid to him subsequently was that of <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cecil%20of%20Chelwood">Lord Robert Cecil</a>, a fellow League of Nations delegate, who spoke of the range of Nansen's work, done with no regard for his own interests or health: "Every good cause had his support. He was a fearless peacemaker, a friend of justice, an advocate always for the weak and suffering."

Nansen was a pioneer and innovator in many fields. As a young man he embraced the revolution in skiing methods that transformed it from a means of winter travel to a universal sport, and quickly became one of Norway's leading skiers. He was later able to apply this expertise to the problems of polar travel, in both his Greenland and his "Fram" expeditions.

He invented the "Nansen sledge" with broad, ski-like runners, the "Nansen cooker" to improve the heat efficiency of the standard spirit stoves then in use, and the layer principle in polar clothing, whereby the traditionally heavy, awkward garments were replaced by layers of lightweight material. In science, Nansen is recognised both as one of the founders of modern <a href="neurology">neurology</a>, and as a significant contributor to early oceanographical science, in particular for his work in establishing the Central Oceanographic Laboratory in Christiania.

Through his work on behalf of the League of Nations, Nansen helped to establish the principle of international responsibility for refugees. Immediately after his death the League set up the <a href="Nansen%20International%20Office%20for%20Refugees">Nansen International Office for Refugees</a>, a semi-autonomous body under the League's authority, to continue his work. The Nansen Office faced great difficulties, in part arising from the large numbers of refugees from the European dictatorships during the 1930s. Nevertheless, it secured the agreement of 14 countries (including a reluctant Great Britain) to the Refugee Convention of 1933.

It also helped to repatriate 10,000 Armenians to <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a> in <a href="Soviet%20Armenia">Soviet Armenia</a>, and to find homes for a further 40,000 in Syria and Lebanon. In 1938, the year in which it was superseded by a wider-ranging body, the Nansen Office was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1954, the League's successor body, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Organisation">United Nations</a>, established the <a href="Nansen%20Refugee%20Award">Nansen Medal</a>, later named the <a href="Nansen%20Refugee%20Award">Nansen Refugee Award</a>, given annually by the <a href="United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> to an individual, group or organisation "for outstanding work on behalf of the forcibly displaced".

Numerous geographical features bear his name: the <a href="Nansen%20Basin">Nansen Basin</a> and the <a href="Gakkel%20Ridge">Nansen-Gakkel Ridge</a> in the Arctic Ocean; <a href="Mount%20Nansen%20%28Yukon%29">Mount Nansen</a> in the Yukon region of Canada; <a href="Mount%20Nansen%20%28Antarctica%29">Mount Nansen</a>, <a href="Mount%20Fridtjof%20Nansen">Mount Fridtjof Nansen</a> and <a href="Nansen%20Island">Nansen Island</a>, all in Antarctica; as well as <a href="Nansen%20Island%20%28Kara%20Sea%29">Nansen Island</a> in the <a href="Kara%20Sea">Kara Sea</a> and <a href="Nansen%20Island%20%28Franz%20Josef%20Land%29">Nansen Island</a> in <a href="Franz%20Josef%20Land">Franz Josef Land</a>; <a href="853%20Nansenia">853 Nansenia</a>, an asteroid; <a href="Nansen%20%28lunar%20crater%29">Nansen</a> crater at the Moon's north pole and <a href="Nansen%20%28Martian%20crater%29">Nansen</a> crater on Mars.

Germanium

Germanium is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with <a href="Symbol%20%28chemistry%29">symbol</a> Ge and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white <a href="metalloid">metalloid</a> in the <a href="carbon%20group">carbon group</a>, chemically similar to its group neighbours <a href="silicon">silicon</a> and <a href="tin">tin</a>. Pure germanium is a <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally <a href="Chemical%20reaction">reacts</a> and forms complexes with <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> in nature.

Because it seldom appears in high concentration, germanium was discovered comparatively late in the <a href="history%20of%20chemistry">history of chemistry</a>. Germanium ranks near fiftieth <a href="Abundance%20of%20elements%20in%20Earth%27s%20crust">in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust</a>. In 1869, <a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a> <a href="Mendeleev%27s%20predicted%20elements">predicted</a> its existence and some of its <a href="Chemical%20property">properties</a> from its position on his <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>, and called the element <a href="Mendeleev%27s%20predicted%20elements%23Ekasilicon%20and%20germanium">ekasilicon</a>. Nearly two decades later, in 1886, <a href="Clemens%20Winkler">Clemens Winkler</a> found the new element along with <a href="silver">silver</a> and <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>, in a rare mineral called <a href="argyrodite">argyrodite</a>. Although the new element somewhat resembled <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> and <a href="antimony">antimony</a> in appearance, the combining ratios in <a href="Chemical%20compound">compounds</a> agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the element after his country, <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a>. Today, germanium is mined primarily from <a href="sphalerite">sphalerite</a> (the primary ore of <a href="zinc">zinc</a>), though germanium is also recovered commercially from <a href="silver">silver</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, and <a href="copper">copper</a> <a href="ore">ore</a>s.

Elemental germanium is used as a semiconductor in <a href="transistor">transistor</a>s and various other electronic devices. Historically, the first decade of semiconductor electronics was based entirely on germanium. Presently, the major end uses are <a href="fibre-optic">fibre-optic</a> systems, <a href="infrared%20vision">infrared optics</a>, <a href="solar%20cell">solar cell</a> applications, and <a href="light-emitting%20diode">light-emitting diode</a>s (LEDs). Germanium compounds are also used for <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a> catalysts and have most recently found use in the production of <a href="nanowire">nanowire</a>s. This element forms a large number of <a href="organogermanium%20compound">organogermanium compound</a>s, such as <a href="tetraethylgermanium">tetraethylgermanium</a>, useful in <a href="organometallic%20chemistry">organometallic chemistry</a>. Germanium is considered a <a href="Technology-critical%20element">technology-critical element</a>.

Germanium is not thought to be an essential element for any <a href="Organic%20chemistry">living organism</a>. Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminium, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral <a href="toxicity">toxicity</a>. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are <a href="nephrotoxic">nephrotoxic</a>, and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> are irritants and toxins.

In his report on "The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements" in 1869, the Russian chemist <a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a> predicted the existence of several unknown <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s, including one that would fill a gap in the <a href="group%2014%20element">carbon family</a>, located between <a href="silicon">silicon</a> and <a href="tin">tin</a>. Because of its position in his periodic table, Mendeleev called it "ekasilicon (Es)", and he estimated its <a href="atomic%20weight">atomic weight</a> to be 70 (later 72).

In mid-1885, at a mine near <a href="Freiberg%2C%20Saxony">Freiberg, Saxony</a>, a new <a href="mineral">mineral</a> was discovered and named "<a href="argyrodite">argyrodite</a>" because of its high <a href="silver">silver</a> content. The chemist <a href="Clemens%20Winkler">Clemens Winkler</a> analyzed this new mineral, which proved to be a combination of silver, sulfur, and a new element. Winkler was able to isolate the new element in 1886 and found it similar to <a href="antimony">antimony</a>. He initially considered the new element to be eka-antimony, but was soon convinced that it was instead eka-silicon. Before Winkler published his results on the new element, he decided that he would name his element "neptunium", since the recent discovery of planet <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> in 1846 had similarly been preceded by mathematical predictions of its existence. However, the name "neptunium" had already been given to another proposed chemical element (though not the element that today bears the name <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a>, which was discovered in 1940). So instead, Winkler named the new element "germanium" (from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word, "Germania", for Germany) in honor of his homeland. Argyrodite proved empirically to be AgGeS.
Because this new element showed some similarities with the elements <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> and antimony, its proper place in the periodic table was under consideration, but its similarities with Dmitri Mendeleev's predicted element "ekasilicon" confirmed that place on the periodic table. With further material from 500 kg of ore from the mines in Saxony, Winkler confirmed the chemical properties of the new element in 1887. He also determined an atomic weight of 72.32 by analyzing pure <a href="germanium%20tetrachloride">germanium tetrachloride</a> (), while <a href="Lecoq%20de%20Boisbaudran">Lecoq de Boisbaudran</a> deduced 72.3 by a comparison of the lines in the spark <a href="spectrum">spectrum</a> of the element.

Winkler was able to prepare several new compounds of germanium, including <a href="Germanium%20fluoride">fluorides</a>, <a href="Germanium%20chloride">chlorides</a>, <a href="Germanium%20sulfide">sulfides</a>, <a href="Germanium%20dioxide">dioxide</a>, and <a href="tetraethylgermane">tetraethylgermane</a> (Ge(CH)), the first organogermane. The physical data from those compounds—which corresponded well with Mendeleev's predictions—made the discovery an important confirmation of Mendeleev's idea of element <a href="Periodic%20table">periodicity</a>. Here is a comparison between the prediction and Winkler's data:

Until the late 1930s, germanium was thought to be a poorly conducting <a href="metal">metal</a>. Germanium did not become economically significant until after 1945 when its properties as an <a href="electronics">electronic</a> semiconductor were recognized. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, small amounts of germanium were used in some special <a href="electronics">electronic devices</a>, mostly <a href="diode">diode</a>s. The first major use was the point-contact <a href="Schottky%20diode">Schottky diode</a>s for <a href="radar">radar</a> pulse detection during the War. The first <a href="silicon-germanium">silicon-germanium</a> alloys were obtained in 1955. Before 1945, only a few hundred kilograms of germanium were produced in smelters each year, but by the end of the 1950s, the annual worldwide production had reached .

The development of the germanium <a href="transistor">transistor</a> in 1948 opened the door to countless applications of <a href="solid%20state%20%28electronics%29">solid state electronics</a>. From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high-purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors, diodes, and <a href="rectifier">rectifier</a>s. For example, the company that became <a href="Fairchild%20Semiconductor">Fairchild Semiconductor</a> was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing silicon transistors. Silicon has superior electrical properties, but it requires much greater purity that could not be commercially achieved in the early years of <a href="solid-state%20electronics">semiconductor electronics</a>.

Meanwhile, the demand for germanium for <a href="fiber%20optics">fiber optic</a> communication networks, infrared <a href="night%20vision">night vision</a> systems, and <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a> <a href="catalysts">catalysts</a> increased dramatically. These end uses represented 85% of worldwide germanium consumption in 2000. The US government even designated germanium as a strategic and critical material, calling for a 146 <a href="Short%20ton">ton</a> (132 <a href="Tonne">tonne</a>) supply in the national defense stockpile in 1987.

Germanium differs from silicon in that the supply is limited by the availability of exploitable sources, while the supply of silicon is limited only by production capacity since silicon comes from ordinary sand and <a href="quartz">quartz</a>. While silicon could be bought in 1998 for less than $10 per kg, the price of germanium was almost $800 per kg.

Under <a href="standard%20conditions">standard conditions</a>, germanium is a brittle, silvery-white, semi-metallic element. This form constitutes an <a href="allotrope">allotrope</a> known as "α-germanium", which has a metallic luster and a <a href="diamond%20cubic">diamond cubic crystal structure</a>, the same as <a href="diamond">diamond</a>. At pressures above 120 <a href="bar%20%28unit%29">kbar</a>, it becomes the allotrope "β-germanium" with the same structure as β-<a href="tin">tin</a>. Like silicon, <a href="gallium">gallium</a>, <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>, <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, and <a href="water">water</a>, germanium is one of the few substances that expands as it solidifies (i.e. <a href="freezing">freezes</a>) from the molten state.

Germanium is a <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a>. <a href="Zone%20refining">Zone refining</a> techniques have led to the production of crystalline germanium for semiconductors that has an impurity of only one part in 10,
making it one of the purest materials ever obtained.
The first metallic material discovered (in 2005) to become a <a href="superconductor">superconductor</a> in the presence of an extremely strong <a href="electromagnetic%20field">electromagnetic field</a> was an <a href="Uranium%20rhodium%20germanium">alloy of germanium, uranium, and rhodium</a>.

Pure germanium suffers from the forming of <a href="Whisker%20%28metallurgy%29">whiskers</a> by spontaneous <a href="screw%20dislocation">screw dislocation</a>s. If a whisker grows long enough to touch another part of the assembly or a metallic packaging, it can effectively <a href="Shunt%20%28electrical%29">shunt out</a> a <a href="p-n%20junction">p-n junction</a>. This is one of the primary reasons for the failure of old germanium diodes and transistors.

Elemental germanium starts to oxidize slowly in air at around 250 °C, forming <a href="germanium%20dioxide">GeO</a> . Germanium is insoluble in dilute <a href="acids">acids</a> and <a href="alkalis">alkalis</a> but dissolves slowly in hot concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids and reacts violently with molten alkalis to produce <a href="germanate">germanate</a>s (). Germanium occurs mostly in the <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> +4 although many +2 compounds are known. Other oxidation states are rare: +3 is found in compounds such as GeCl, and +3 and +1 are found on the surface of oxides, or negative oxidation states in <a href="germanide">germanide</a>s, such as −4 in . Germanium cluster anions (<a href="Zintl%20phase">Zintl</a> ions) such as Ge, Ge, Ge, [(Ge)] have been prepared by the extraction from alloys containing alkali metals and germanium in liquid ammonia in the presence of <a href="ethylenediamine">ethylenediamine</a> or a <a href="cryptand">cryptand</a>. The oxidation states of the element in these ions are not integers—similar to the <a href="ozonide">ozonide</a>s O.

Two <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s of germanium are known: <a href="germanium%20dioxide">germanium dioxide</a> (, germania) and <a href="germanium%20monoxide">germanium monoxide</a>, (). The dioxide, GeO can be obtained by roasting <a href="germanium%20disulfide">germanium disulfide</a> (), and is a white powder that is only slightly soluble in water but reacts with alkalis to form germanates. The monoxide, germanous oxide, can be obtained by the high temperature reaction of GeO with Ge metal. The dioxide (and the related oxides and germanates) exhibits the unusual property of having a high refractive index for visible light, but transparency to <a href="infrared">infrared</a> light. <a href="Bismuth%20germanate">Bismuth germanate</a>, BiGeO, (BGO) is used as a <a href="scintillator">scintillator</a>.

<a href="Binary%20compound">Binary compound</a>s with other <a href="chalcogen">chalcogen</a>s are also known, such as the di<a href="sulfide">sulfide</a> (), di<a href="selenide">selenide</a> (), and the <a href="germanium%20monosulfide">monosulfide</a> (GeS), selenide (GeSe), and <a href="Telluride%20%28chemistry%29">telluride</a> (GeTe). GeS forms as a white precipitate when hydrogen sulfide is passed through strongly acid solutions containing Ge(IV). The disulfide is appreciably soluble in water and in solutions of caustic alkalis or alkaline sulfides. Nevertheless, it is not soluble in acidic water, which allowed Winkler to discover the element. By heating the disulfide in a current of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, the monosulfide (GeS) is formed, which sublimes in thin plates of a dark color and metallic luster, and is soluble in solutions of the caustic alkalis. Upon melting with <a href="alkali%20metal%20compound">alkaline carbonates</a> and <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>, germanium compounds form salts known as thiogermanates.
Four tetra<a href="halides">halides</a> are known. Under normal conditions GeI is a solid, GeF a gas and the others volatile liquids. For example, <a href="germanium%20tetrachloride">germanium tetrachloride</a>, GeCl, is obtained as a colorless fuming liquid boiling at 83.1 °C by heating the metal with chlorine. All the tetrahalides are readily hydrolyzed to hydrated germanium dioxide. GeCl is used in the production of organogermanium compounds. All four dihalides are known and in contrast to the tetrahalides are polymeric solids. Additionally GeCl and some higher compounds of formula GeCl are known. The unusual compound GeCl has been prepared that contains the GeCl unit with a <a href="neopentane">neopentane</a> structure.

<a href="Germane">Germane</a> (GeH) is a compound similar in structure to <a href="methane">methane</a>. Polygermanes—compounds that are similar to <a href="alkane">alkane</a>s—with formula GeH containing up to five germanium atoms are known. The germanes are less volatile and less reactive than their corresponding silicon analogues. GeH reacts with alkali metals in liquid ammonia to form white crystalline MGeH which contain the GeH <a href="anion">anion</a>. The germanium hydrohalides with one, two and three halogen atoms are colorless reactive liquids.
The first <a href="organogermanium%20compound">organogermanium compound</a> was synthesized by Winkler in 1887; the reaction of germanium tetrachloride with <a href="diethylzinc">diethylzinc</a> yielded <a href="tetraethylgermane">tetraethylgermane</a> (). Organogermanes of the type RGe (where R is an <a href="alkyl">alkyl</a>) such as <a href="tetramethylgermane">tetramethylgermane</a> () and tetraethylgermane are accessed through the cheapest available germanium precursor <a href="germanium%20tetrachloride">germanium tetrachloride</a> and alkyl nucleophiles. Organic germanium hydrides such as <a href="isobutylgermane">isobutylgermane</a> () were found to be less hazardous and may be used as a liquid substitute for toxic <a href="germane">germane</a> gas in <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> applications. Many germanium <a href="reactive%20intermediate">reactive intermediate</a>s are known: <a href="-yl">germyl</a> <a href="free%20radical">free radical</a>s, germylenes (similar to <a href="carbene">carbene</a>s), and germynes (similar to <a href="carbyne">carbyne</a>s). The organogermanium compound <a href="Propagermanium">2-carboxyethylgermasesquioxane</a> was first reported in the 1970s, and for a while was used as a dietary supplement and thought to possibly have anti-tumor qualities.

Using a ligand called Eind (1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octaethyl-s-hydrindacen-4-yl) germanium is able to form a double bond with oxygen (germanone).

Germanium occurs in 5 natural <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s: , , , , and . Of these, is very slightly radioactive, decaying by <a href="double%20beta%20decay">double beta decay</a> with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of . is the most common isotope, having a <a href="natural%20abundance">natural abundance</a> of approximately 36%. is the least common with a natural abundance of approximately 7%. When bombarded with alpha particles, the isotope will generate stable , releasing high energy electrons in the process. Because of this, it is used in combination with <a href="radon">radon</a> for <a href="Atomic%20battery">nuclear batteries</a>.

At least 27 <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a>s have also been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 58 to 89. The most stable of these is , decaying by <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> with a half-life of ays. The least stable is , with a half-life of . While most of germanium's radioisotopes decay by <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>, and decay by <a href="Positron%20emission"></a> delayed <a href="proton%20emission">proton emission</a>. through isotopes also exhibit minor <a href="Beta%20decay"></a> delayed <a href="neutron%20emission">neutron emission</a> decay paths.

Germanium is created by <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a>, mostly by the <a href="s-process">s-process</a> in <a href="asymptotic%20giant%20branch">asymptotic giant branch</a> stars. The s-process is a slow <a href="neutron">neutron</a> capture of lighter elements inside pulsating <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> stars. Germanium has been detected in some of the most distant stars and in the atmosphere of Jupiter.

Germanium's abundance <a href="abundance%20of%20elements%20in%20Earth%27s%20crust">in the Earth's crust</a> is approximately 1.6 <a href="Parts%20per%20million">ppm</a>. Only a few minerals like <a href="argyrodite">argyrodite</a>, <a href="briartite">briartite</a>, <a href="germanite">germanite</a>, and <a href="renierite">renierite</a> contain appreciable amounts of germanium. Only few of them (especially germanite) are, very rarely, found in mineable amounts. Some zinc-copper-lead ore bodies contain enough germanium to justify extraction from the final ore concentrate. An unusual natural enrichment process causes a high content of germanium in some coal seams, discovered by <a href="Victor%20Moritz%20Goldschmidt">Victor Moritz Goldschmidt</a> during a broad survey for germanium deposits. The highest concentration ever found was in <a href="Hartley%2C%20Northumberland">Hartley</a> coal ash with as much as 1.6% germanium. The coal deposits near <a href="Xilinhaote">Xilinhaote</a>, <a href="Inner%20Mongolia">Inner Mongolia</a>, contain an estimated 1600 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s of germanium.

About 118 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s of germanium was produced in 2011 worldwide, mostly in China (80 t), Russia (5 t) and United States (3 t). Germanium is recovered as a by-product from <a href="sphalerite">sphalerite</a> <a href="zinc">zinc</a> ores where it is concentrated in amounts as great as 0.3%, especially from low-temperature sediment-hosted, massive <a href="zinc">Zn</a>–<a href="lead">Pb</a>–<a href="copper">Cu</a>(–<a href="barium">Ba</a>) deposits and carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb deposits. A recent study found that at least 10,000 t of extractable germanium is contained in known zinc reserves, particularly those hosted by <a href="Carbonate-hosted%20lead-zinc%20ore%20deposits">Mississippi-Valley type deposits</a>, while at least 112,000 t will be found in coal reserves. In 2007 35% of the demand was met by recycled germanium.
While it is produced mainly from <a href="sphalerite">sphalerite</a>, it is also found in <a href="silver">silver</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, and <a href="copper">copper</a> ores. Another source of germanium is <a href="fly%20ash">fly ash</a> of power plants fueled from coal deposits that contain germanium. Russia and China used this as a source for germanium. Russia's deposits are located in the far east of <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a> Island, and northeast of <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a>. The deposits in China are located mainly in the <a href="lignite">lignite</a> mines near <a href="Lincang">Lincang</a>, <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a>; coal is also mined near <a href="Xilinhaote">Xilinhaote</a>, <a href="Inner%20Mongolia">Inner Mongolia</a>.

The ore concentrates are mostly <a href="sulfide">sulfidic</a>; they are converted to the <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s by heating under air in a process known as <a href="Roasting%20%28metallurgy%29">roasting</a>:

Some of the germanium is left in the dust produced, while the rest is converted to germanates, which are then leached (together with zinc) from the cinder by sulfuric acid. After neutralization, only the zinc stays in solution while germanium and other metals precipitate. After removing some of the zinc in the precipitate by the <a href="Waelz%20process">Waelz process</a>, the residing Waelz oxide is leached a second time. The <a href="germanium%20dioxide">dioxide</a> is obtained as precipitate and converted with <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> gas or hydrochloric acid to <a href="germanium%20tetrachloride">germanium tetrachloride</a>, which has a low boiling point and can be isolated by distillation:

Germanium tetrachloride is either hydrolyzed to the oxide (GeO) or purified by fractional distillation and then hydrolyzed. The highly pure GeO is now suitable for the production of germanium glass. It is reduced to the element by reacting it with hydrogen, producing germanium suitable for infrared optics and semiconductor production:

The germanium for steel production and other industrial processes is normally reduced using carbon:

The major end uses for germanium in 2007, worldwide, were estimated to be: 35% for <a href="fiber-optic">fiber-optic</a>s, 30% <a href="Infrared%20vision">infrared optics</a>, 15% <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a> catalysts, and 15% electronics and solar electric applications. The remaining 5% went into such uses as phosphors, metallurgy, and chemotherapy.

The notable properties of <a href="Germanium%20dioxide">germania</a> (GeO) are its high <a href="refractive%20index">index of refraction</a> and its low <a href="Dispersion%20%28optics%29">optical dispersion</a>. These make it especially useful for <a href="wide-angle%20camera%20lens">wide-angle camera lens</a>es, <a href="microscopy">microscopy</a>, and the core part of <a href="optical%20fiber">optical fiber</a>s. It has replaced <a href="titanium%20dioxide">titania</a> as the <a href="dopant">dopant</a> for silica fiber, eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle. At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption. <a href="GeSbTe">GeSbTe</a> is a <a href="phase%20change%20material">phase change material</a> used for its optic properties, such as that used in <a href="DVD-RW">rewritable DVDs</a>.

Because germanium is transparent in the infrared wavelengths, it is an important <a href="infrared">infrared</a> optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in <a href="Thermographic%20camera">thermal imaging cameras</a> working in the 8 to 14 <a href="micrometre">micron</a> range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile <a href="night%20vision">night vision</a>, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared <a href="spectroscope">spectroscope</a>s and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive <a href="Infrared%20photography">infrared detectors</a>. It has a very high <a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a> (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of <a href="diamond-like%20carbon">diamond-like carbon</a> (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.

<a href="Silicon-germanium">Silicon-germanium</a> alloys are rapidly becoming an important semiconductor material for high-speed integrated circuits. Circuits utilizing the properties of Si-SiGe junctions can be much faster than those using silicon alone. Silicon-germanium is beginning to replace <a href="gallium%20arsenide">gallium arsenide</a> (GaAs) in wireless communications devices. The SiGe chips, with high-speed properties, can be made with low-cost, well-established production techniques of the <a href="silicon%20chip">silicon chip</a> industry.

<a href="Solar%20panel">Solar panel</a>s are a major use of germanium. Germanium is the substrate of the wafers for high-efficiency <a href="multijunction%20photovoltaic%20cell">multijunction photovoltaic cell</a>s for space applications. High-brightness LEDs, used for automobile headlights and to backlight LCD screens, are an important application.

Because germanium and <a href="gallium%20arsenide">gallium arsenide</a> have very similar lattice constants, germanium substrates can be used to make gallium arsenide <a href="solar%20cell">solar cell</a>s. The <a href="Mars%20Exploration%20Rover">Mars Exploration Rover</a>s and several satellites use triple junction gallium arsenide on germanium cells.

Germanium-on-insulator (GeOI) substrates are seen as a potential replacement for silicon on miniaturized chips. CMOS circuit based on GeOI substrates has been reported recently. Other uses in electronics include <a href="phosphor">phosphor</a>s in <a href="fluorescent%20lamp">fluorescent lamp</a>s and solid-state light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Germanium transistors are still used in some <a href="effects%20pedal">effects pedal</a>s by musicians who wish to reproduce the distinctive tonal character of the <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">"fuzz"-tone</a> from the early <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> era, most notably the <a href="Fuzz%20Face">Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face</a>.

Germanium dioxide is also used in <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>s for <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a> in the production of <a href="polyethylene%20terephthalate">polyethylene terephthalate</a> (PET). The high brilliance of this polyester is especially favored for PET bottles marketed in Japan. In the United States, germanium is not used for polymerization catalysts.

Due to the similarity between silica (SiO) and germanium dioxide (GeO), the silica stationary phase in some <a href="gas%20chromatography">gas chromatography</a> columns can be replaced by GeO.

In recent years germanium has seen increasing use in precious metal alloys. In <a href="sterling%20silver">sterling silver</a> alloys, for instance, it reduces <a href="firescale">firescale</a>, increases tarnish resistance, and improves precipitation hardening. A tarnish-proof silver alloy trademarked <a href="Argentium%20sterling%20silver">Argentium</a> contains 1.2% germanium.

<a href="Semiconductor%20detector%23Germanium%20detector">Semiconductor detectors</a> made of single crystal high-purity germanium can precisely identify radiation sources—for example in airport security. Germanium is useful for <a href="Crystal%20monochromator">monochromators</a> for <a href="beamline">beamline</a>s used in <a href="single%20crystal">single crystal</a> <a href="neutron%20scattering">neutron scattering</a> and <a href="Synchrotron%20light">synchrotron X-ray</a> diffraction. The reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and <a href="High%20energy%20X-rays">high energy X-ray</a> applications. Crystals of high purity germanium are used in detectors for <a href="gamma%20spectroscopy">gamma spectroscopy</a> and the search for <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a>. Germanium crystals are also used in X-ray spectrometers for the determination of phosphorus, chlorine and sulfur.

Germanium is emerging as an important material for <a href="spintronics">spintronics</a> and spin-based <a href="quantum%20computing">quantum computing</a> applications. In 2010, researchers demonstrated room temperature spin transport and more recently donor electron spins in germanium has been shown to have very long <a href="coherence%20time">coherence time</a>s.

Germanium is not considered essential to the health of plants or animals. Germanium in the environment has little or no health impact. This is primarily because it usually occurs only as a trace element in ores and <a href="carbon">carbon</a>aceous materials, and the various industrial and electronic applications involve very small quantities that are not likely to be ingested. For similar reasons, end-use germanium has little impact on the environment as a biohazard. Some reactive intermediate compounds of germanium are poisonous (see precautions, below).

Germanium supplements, made from both organic and inorganic germanium, have been marketed as an <a href="alternative%20medicine">alternative medicine</a> capable of treating <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> and <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>. There is, however, no <a href="evidence-based%20medicine">medical evidence</a> of benefit; some evidence suggests that such supplements are actively harmful.

Some germanium compounds have been administered by alternative medical practitioners as non-FDA-allowed injectable solutions. Soluble inorganic forms of germanium used at first, notably the citrate-lactate salt, resulted in some cases of <a href="renal">renal</a> dysfunction, <a href="hepatic%20steatosis">hepatic steatosis</a>, and peripheral <a href="neuropathy">neuropathy</a> in individuals using them over a long term. Plasma and urine germanium concentrations in these individuals, several of whom died, were several orders of magnitude greater than <a href="endogenous">endogenous</a> levels. A more recent organic form, beta-carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide (<a href="propagermanium">propagermanium</a>), has not exhibited the same spectrum of toxic effects.

<a href="U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> research has concluded that inorganic germanium, when used as a <a href="nutritional%20supplement">nutritional supplement</a>, "presents potential human <a href="health%20hazard">health hazard</a>".

Certain compounds of germanium have low toxicity to <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, but have toxic effects against certain <a href="bacterium">bacteria</a>.

Some of germanium's artificially produced compounds are quite reactive and present an immediate hazard to human health on exposure. For example, <a href="Germanium%20tetrachloride">germanium chloride</a> and <a href="germane">germane</a> (GeH) are a liquid and gas, respectively, that can be very irritating to the eyes, skin, lungs, and throat.

As of the year 2000, about 15% of United States consumption of germanium was used for infrared optics technology and 50% for fiber-optics. Over the past 20 years, infrared use has consistently decreased; fiber optic demand, however, is slowly increasing. In America, 30–50% of current fiber optic lines are unused <a href="dark%20fiber">dark fiber</a>, sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, demand is increasing dramatically as countries such as China are installing fiber optic telecommunication lines throughout the country.
