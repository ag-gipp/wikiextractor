Circinus

Circinus is a small, faint <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="southern%20sky">southern sky</a>, first defined in 1756 by the French astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a>. Its name is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for <a href="compass%20%28drawing%20tool%29">compass</a>, referring to the <a href="Technical%20drawing">drafting</a> tool used for drawing circles (it should not be confused with <a href="Pyxis">Pyxis</a>, a constellation that represents a <a href="mariner%27s%20compass">mariner's compass</a> which points north). Its brightest star is <a href="Alpha%20Circini">Alpha Circini</a>, with an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 3.19. Slightly <a href="variable%20star">variable</a>, it is the brightest <a href="rapidly%20oscillating%20Ap%20star">rapidly oscillating Ap star</a> in the night sky. <a href="AX%20Circini">AX Circini</a> is a <a href="Cepheid%20variable">Cepheid variable</a> visible with the unaided eye, and <a href="BX%20Circini">BX Circini</a> is a faint star thought to have been formed from the merger of two <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>s. Two sun-like stars have planetary systems: <a href="HD%20134060">HD 134060</a> has two small planets, and <a href="HD%20129445">HD 129445</a> has a <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>-like planet. <a href="Supernova">Supernova</a> <a href="SN%20185">SN 185</a> appeared in Circinus in 185 AD and was recorded by Chinese observers. Two <a href="nova">nova</a>e have been observed more recently, in the 20th century.

The <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> runs through the constellation, featuring prominent objects such as the <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> <a href="NGC%205823">NGC 5823</a> and the <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a> <a href="NGC%205315">NGC 5315</a>. Circinus hosts a <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a>, the <a href="Circinus%20Galaxy">Circinus Galaxy</a>, which was discovered in 1977 and is the closest <a href="Seyfert%20galaxy">Seyfert galaxy</a> to the Milky Way. The <a href="Alpha%20Circinids">Alpha Circinids</a> (ACI), a <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a> also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation.

In 1756, French astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> introduced the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of Circinus with the French name "le Compas", representing a pair of dividing <a href="compass%20%28drawing%20tool%29">compass</a>es, on a chart of the southern sky. On that chart, Lacaille portrayed the constellations of <a href="Norma%20%28constellation%29">Norma</a>, Circinus, and <a href="Triangulum%20Australe">Triangulum Australe</a>, respectively, as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level in a set of draughtsman's instruments. Circinus was given its current name in 1763, when Lacaille published an updated sky map with Latin names for the constellations he introduced.

Bordered by <a href="Centaurus">Centaurus</a>, <a href="Musca">Musca</a>, <a href="Apus">Apus</a>, Triangulum Australe, Norma and <a href="Lupus%20%28constellation%29">Lupus</a>, Circinus lies adjacent to the <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha</a> and <a href="Beta%20Centauri">Beta Centauri</a> stars. As it is at <a href="declination">declination</a> −50° to −70°, the whole constellation is only visible south of <a href="latitude">latitude</a> <a href="30th%20parallel%20north">30° N</a>. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a <a href="polygon">polygon</a> of 14 segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , and the declination coordinates are between −55.43° and −70.62°. Circinus <a href="Culmination">culminates</a> each year at 9 p.m. on 30 July. The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Cir'.

Circinus is a faint constellation, with only one star brighter than fourth magnitude. <a href="Alpha%20Circini">Alpha Circini</a>, a white <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> star with an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 3.19, is 54 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s away and 4° south of <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a>. Not only the brightest star in the constellation, it is also the brightest example of a <a href="Rapidly%20oscillating%20Ap%20star">rapidly oscillating Ap (RoAp) star</a> in the night sky. It has the unusual <a href="spectral%20type">spectral type</a> A7 Vp SrCrE, showing increased emissions of <a href="strontium">strontium</a>, <a href="chromium">chromium</a> and <a href="europium">europium</a>. Stars of this type have oddly localised <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>s and are slightly <a href="variable%20star">variable</a>. Alpha Circini forms a <a href="binary%20star">binary</a> <a href="star%20system">star system</a> with an <a href="K-type%20main-sequence%20star">orange dwarf</a> companion of spectral type K5 and magnitude 8.5, which with a separation of 5.7 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s is only discernible with a telescope. The distance between the two stars is 260 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a> and they take 2600 years to rotate around a common centre of gravity. The second brightest star is <a href="Beta%20Circini">Beta Circini</a>, a white main sequence star of spectral type A3Va and a magnitude of 4.07, about 100 light-years away. It has around 1.8 times the diameter of the Sun.
<a href="Gamma%20Circini">Gamma Circini</a> is a binary star 450 light-years away, whose components need a telescope of 150 mm to be seen, as they are only 0.8 arcseconds apart. The brighter component is a bluish <a href="Be%20star">Be star</a> of spectral type B5IV+ and magnitude 4.51, while the dimmer component is a <a href="G-type%20main-sequence%20star">yellow star</a> of magnitude 5.5. They orbit each other every 180 years. <a href="Delta%20Circini">Delta Circini</a> is also a multiple star whose components have magnitudes of 5.1 and 13.4 and orbit around a common centre of gravity every 3.9 days. The brighter component is a close <a href="eclipsing%20binary">eclipsing binary</a> (specifically, a <a href="rotating%20ellipsoidal%20variable">rotating ellipsoidal variable</a>), with a minor dip of magnitude (0.1). Both are hot <a href="O-type%20main-sequence%20star">blue stars</a> of spectral types O7III-V and O9.5V, respectively, and are estimated to have around 22 and 12 times the Sun's mass. Over 3600 light-years away, this system would outshine <a href="Venus">Venus</a> at magnitude −4.8 if it were 32 light-years (10 <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s) distant. The two main components are separated by 50 arcseconds, resolvable to the naked eye for individuals with good vision and easily discernible with a telescope.

<a href="Eta%20Circini">Eta Circini</a> is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III and magnitude 5.17, located around 276 light-years distant, and <a href="Zeta%20Circini">Zeta Circini</a> is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B3V and magnitude 6.09, located around 1273 light-years away.
493 variable stars have been recorded in Circinus, but most have a very small range or are quite dim. Three prominent examples are <a href="Theta%20Circini">Theta Circini</a>, <a href="T%20Circini">T Circini</a>, and <a href="AX%20Circini">AX Circini</a>. Theta Circini is a B-class irregular variable, ranging in magnitude from 5.0 to 5.4. T Circini has a B-type spectrum, ranging in magnitude from 10.6 to 9.3 over a period of 3.298 days, although it is actually an eclipsing binary system rather than a pulsating star. AX is a <a href="Cepheid%20variable">Cepheid variable</a> that varies between magnitudes 5.6 and 6.19 over 5.3 days. It is a yellow-white supergiant of spectral type F8II+, 1600 light-years away. <a href="BP%20Circini">BP Circini</a> is another <a href="Cepheid%20variable">Cepheid variable</a> with an apparent magnitude ranging from 7.37 to 7.71 over 2.4 days. Both cepheids are spectroscopic binaries, with companions that are blue-white stars of spectral type B6 and 5 and 4.7 solar masses respectively. <a href="BX%20Circini">BX Circini</a> is a faint star that fluctuates between magnitudes 12.57 and 12.62 over a period of 2 hours 33 minutes. Over 99% of its composition appears to be helium. Its origin is unclear, but thought to be the result of the merger of a helium and a carbon/oxygen white dwarf.
Several stars with planetary systems lie within the borders of Circinus, although none of the host stars are particularly prominent. <a href="HD%20134060">HD 134060</a> is a sun-like yellow dwarf star of spectral type G0VFe+0.4 and magnitude 6.29, around 79 light-years away. Its two planets were discovered in 2011 through the <a href="radial%20velocity%20method">radial velocity method</a>: the smaller, <a href="HD%20134060%20b">HD 134060 b</a>, has a mass of 0.0351 <a href="Jupiter%20mass">M</a> (Jupiter masses) and orbits its star every 3.27 days, at 0.0444 AU; the larger, <a href="HD%20134060%20c">HD 134060 c</a> (0.15 M), orbits farther out at 2.226 AU, with a period of approximately 1161 days. Even fainter, at magnitude 8.8, <a href="HD%20129445">HD 129445</a> is 220 light-years away and has 99% of the Sun's mass and a similar spectral type of G8V. <a href="HD%20129445%20b">HD 129445 b</a>, a <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>-like planet (1.6 M) discovered in 2010 via the radial velocity method, orbits this star at a distance of 2.9 AU, approximately every 1840 days.

Three <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>s and a <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a> are found within the borders of Circinus, all visible with amateur telescopes of varying sizes. <a href="NGC%205823">NGC 5823</a>, also called <a href="Caldwell%20catalogue">Caldwell</a> 88, is an 800-million-year-old open cluster, located 3500 light-years away and spanning a 12-light-year region along the constellation's northern border. Despite having an integrated magnitude of 7.9, the cluster can be seen by <a href="star%20hopping">star hopping</a> from Beta Circini or from Alpha Centauri. It contains 80–100 stars of 10th magnitude and fainter, which are spread out over a diameter of 10 arcseconds. The brighter stars, however, are not true members of the cluster, as they are closer to the Earth than the dimmer ones. NGC 5823 appears distinct to the observer, sometimes seen as a reversed "S", as described by <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a>, although it has also been described as "tulip-shaped" and "boxy". That cluster can be easily mistaken with a similar cluster, <a href="NGC%205822">NGC 5822</a>, nearby in <a href="Lupus%20%28constellation%29">Lupus</a>. Comparatively, open cluster <a href="NGC%205715">NGC 5715</a> is fainter (integrated magnitude of 9.8)—its brightest star is only 11th magnitude—and smaller (7.0 arcminutes), comprising only 30 stars. The third open cluster, <a href="Pismis%2020">Pismis 20</a>, contains 12 stars in a diameter of 4.5 arcseconds but exhibits a magnitude similar to NGC 5823 (7.8). At 8270 light-years, it requires an amateur telescope with an aperture over 300 mm to be easily discerned.
The planetary nebula <a href="NGC%205315">NGC 5315</a> has a magnitude of 9.8 around a central star of magnitude 14.2, located 5.2 degrees west-southwest of Alpha Circini. It is only visible as a disc at magnifications over 200-fold. <a href="Bernes%20145">Bernes 145</a> is a <a href="dark%20nebula">dark</a> and <a href="reflection%20nebula">reflection nebula</a> first listed in the 1971 Bernes Catalog. The dark nebula component is easily visible in a large amateur telescope, and it measures 12 by 5 arcminutes. The smaller reflection nebula component requires a larger instrument and <a href="averted%20vision">averted vision</a> to be seen.

Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, commonly known as the <a href="Circinus%20Galaxy">Circinus Galaxy</a>. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust. This oblong <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> with 6.9 by 3.0 arcminutes and 26,000 light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the <a href="galactic%20plane">galactic plane</a>. It is the closest <a href="Seyfert%20galaxy">Seyfert galaxy</a> to the Milky Way, and therefore hosts an <a href="active%20galactic%20nucleus">active galactic nucleus</a>.
<a href="Circinus%20X-1">Circinus X-1</a> is an <a href="X-ray%20binary">X-ray binary</a> star system that includes a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>. Observations of Circinus X-1 in July 2007 revealed the presence of X-ray jets normally found in <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> systems. Located at 19,000 light-years, the pulsar <a href="PSR%20B1509-58">PSR B1509-58</a>, also called the Circinus Pulsar, has expelled a 20-light-year-long jet of material from its southern pole, clearly visible in the <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> spectrum. Another <a href="supernova">supernova</a> <a href="supernova%20remnant">remnant</a> in Circinus is that of <a href="SN%20185">SN 185</a>. Recorded by Chinese observers in 185 AD, SN 185 was visible in the night sky for around eight months; its remnants, known as RCW 86, cover an area larger than the typical full moon.

A white dwarf star in a close binary system can accumulate material from its companion until it ignites and blows off in a thermonuclear explosion, known as a <a href="nova">nova</a>. These stars generally brighten by 7 to 16 magnitudes. Nova Circini 1926, also known as <a href="X%20Circini">X Circini</a>, was observed at magnitude 6.5 on 3 September 1926, before fading and fluctuating between magnitudes 11.7 and 12.5, during 1928, and magnitude 13, in 1929. Nova Circini 1995 (<a href="BY%20Circini">BY Circini</a>) reached a maximum apparent magnitude of 7.2 in January 1995. <a href="BW%20Circini">BW Circini</a> is a low mass X-ray binary system, comprising a black hole of around 8 solar masses and a yellow G0III-G5III subgiant star. X-ray outbursts were recorded in 1987 and 1997, and possibly 1971–72.

Circinus is the <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiant</a> of an annual <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a>, the <a href="Alpha%20Circinids">Alpha Circinids</a> (ACI). First observed in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> in 1977, the meteors have an average velocity of 27.1 km/s and are thought to be associated with a <a href="long-period%20comet">long-period comet</a>. In 2011, <a href="Peter%20Jenniskens">Peter Jenniskens</a> proposed that the debris trail of comet C/1969 T1 could intersect with the Earth's orbit and generate a meteor outburst coming from a radiant close to Beta Circini. The ACI shower peaks on 4 June, the day it was first observed.

Musca

Musca () is a small <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the deep southern sky. It was one of 12 constellations created by <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> from the observations of <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a>, and it first appeared on a <a href="globe%23Celestial">celestial globe</a> in diameter published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a>. The first depiction of this constellation in a <a href="Celestial%20cartography">celestial atlas</a> was in <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" of 1603. It was also known as Apis () for 200 years. Musca remains below the horizon for most Northern Hemisphere observers.

Many of the constellation's brighter stars are members of the <a href="Scorpius%E2%80%93Centaurus%20Association">Scorpius–Centaurus Association</a>, a loose group of hot blue-white stars that appears to share a common origin and motion across the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. These include <a href="Alpha%20Muscae">Alpha</a>, <a href="Beta%20Muscae">Beta</a>, <a href="Gamma%20Muscae">Gamma</a>, <a href="Zeta2%20Muscae">Zeta</a> and (probably) <a href="Eta%20Muscae">Eta Muscae</a>, as well as <a href="HD%20100546">HD 100546</a>, a blue-white <a href="Herbig%20Ae/Be%20star">Herbig Ae/Be star</a> that is surrounded by a complex <a href="debris%20disk">debris disk</a> containing a large <a href="exoplanet">planet</a> or <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> and possible protoplanet. Two further star systems have been found to have planets. The constellation also contains two <a href="Classical%20Cepheid%20variable">cepheid variables</a> visible to the naked eye. <a href="Theta%20Muscae">Theta Muscae</a> is a triple star system, the brightest member of which is a <a href="Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet%20star">Wolf–Rayet star</a>.

Musca was one of the 12 constellations established by the Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius from the observations of the southern sky by the Dutch explorers <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a>, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the "<a href="First%20Dutch%20Expedition%20to%20Indonesia">Eerste Schipvaart</a>", to the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue in 1598 under the Dutch name "De Vlieghe", "The Fly". They assigned four stars to the constellation, with a star that would be later designated as Beta Muscae marking the head, Gamma the body, and Alpha and Delta the left and right wings, respectively. It first appeared on a 35-cm-diameter (14-in) <a href="globe%23Celestial">celestial globe</a> published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with Jodocus Hondius, though was unnamed. The first depiction of this constellation in a <a href="Celestial%20cartography">celestial atlas</a> was in the German cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s "Uranometria" of 1603, though Bayer termed it Apis— "the Bee", a name by which it was known for the next two centuries. A 1603 celestial globe by <a href="Willem%20Blaeu">Willem Blaeu</a> depicts it as providing nourishment for the nearby constellation <a href="Chamaeleon">Chamaeleon</a>—its tongue trying to catch the insect.

The French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> called it "la Mouche" on the 1756 version of his <a href="planisphere">planisphere</a> of the southern skies. <a href="Jean%20Nicolas%20Fortin">Jean Fortin</a> retained the French name in 1776 for his "Atlas Céleste", while Lacaille <a href="latin">latin</a>ised the name for his revised "Coelum Australe Stelliferum" in 1763. Lacaille renamed it to "Musca Australis", the Southern Fly—"Australis", since it counterparted the now <a href="former%20constellations">discarded constellation</a> of <a href="Musca%20Borealis">Musca Borealis</a> composed of a few stars in <a href="Aries%20%28constellation%29">Aries</a>, and to avoid <a href="Apus">confusion with Apus</a>. Today, the name is simply Musca. It is the only official constellation depicting an insect.

The <a href="Kalapalo%20people">Kalapalo people</a> of <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a> state in Brazil called Alpha and Beta Muscae (along with <a href="Beta%20Crucis">Beta</a> and <a href="Kappa%20Crucis%20%28star%29">Kappa Crucis</a>) "Kutsu anangagï" "<a href="Ornate%20Hawk-Eagle">Ornate Hawk-Eagle</a>'s double flutes". The <a href="Wardaman%20people">Wardaman people</a> of the Northern Territory in Australia perceived the main stars of Musca as a ceremonial boomerang, part of the Central Arena—a sacred area surrounding the constellation Crux that depicts the lightning creation beings and where they teach Wardaman customs; Alpha and Beta also signified a ceremonial headband, while <a href="Gamma%20Muscae">Gamma</a> and <a href="Delta%20Muscae">Delta</a> represented two armbands. In central Australia, the <a href="Upper%20Arrernte%20language">Arrernte</a> and <a href="Luritja%20dialect">Luritja</a> peoples living in on a mission in <a href="Hermannsburg%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Hermannsburg</a> viewed the sky as divided between them, east of the Milky Way representing Arrernte camps and west denoting Luritja camps. The stars of Musca, along with <a href="Fomalhaut">Fomalhaut</a>, <a href="Alpha%20Pavonis">Alpha Pavonis</a>, and <a href="Alpha%20Gruis">Alpha</a> and <a href="Beta%20Gruis">Beta Gruis</a>, were all claimed by the Arrernte.

Musca is bordered by <a href="Crux">Crux</a> to the north, <a href="Carina%20%28constellation%29">Carina</a> to the west, <a href="Chamaeleon">Chamaeleon</a> to the south, <a href="Apus">Apus</a> and <a href="Circinus%20%28constellation%29">Circinus</a> to the east, and <a href="Centaurus">Centaurus</a> to the northeast. Covering 138 square degrees and 0.335% of the night sky, it ranks 77th of the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Mus'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of six segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −64.64° and −75.68°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude <a href="14th%20parallel%20north">14°N</a>.

Lacaille charted and designated 10 stars with the <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s Alpha to Kappa in 1756. He catalogued stars that became <a href="Lambda%20Muscae">Lambda</a> and <a href="Mu%20Muscae">Mu</a>, but did not designate them as he considered them "informes" as they lay outside the asterism proper. Baily considered them part of Musca, and Gould gave them their Bayer designations. <a href="Francis%20Baily">Francis Baily</a> also dropped Kappa, which he felt was too faint to warrant a name, and designated two adjacent stars as <a href="Zeta1%20Muscae">Zeta</a> and <a href="Zeta2%20Muscae">Zeta</a>. These last two stars are 1° apart, quite far to be sharing a Bayer designation. Lacaille had originally labelled the fainter one as Zeta, while Baily presupposed he had meant to label the brighter one. Reluctant to remove Lacaille's designation, he gave them both the Zeta designation. Altogether there are 62 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5 in the constellation.

The pattern of the brightest stars resembles that of <a href="Ursa%20Minor">Ursa Minor</a>, in that the stars form a pattern reminiscent of a bowl with a handle. Lying south-southeast of <a href="Acrux">Acrux</a> in neighbouring Crux is <a href="Alpha%20Muscae">Alpha Muscae</a>. It is the brightest star in the constellation with an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 2.7. Lying around 310 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s away, it is a blue-white star of <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Spectral%20types">spectral type</a> B2IV-V that is around 4520 times as <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> and 8 times as massive as the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. The star is a <a href="Beta%20Cephei%20variable">Beta Cephei variable</a> with about 4.7 times the Sun's diameter, and pulsates every 2.2 hours, varying by 1% in brightness. A nearby star of magnitude 13 may or may not be a companion star. Marking the fly's tail is Gamma Muscae, a blue-white star of spectral type B5V that varies between magnitudes 3.84 and 3.86 over a period of 2.7 days. It is a variable of a different type, classed as a <a href="slowly%20pulsating%20B%20star">slowly pulsating B star</a>, a type of variable. It is around five times as massive as our Sun.

Beta Muscae is a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> system around 341 light-years distant that is composed of two <a href="B-type%20main-sequence%20star">blue-white main-sequence stars</a> of spectral types B2V and B3V that orbit each other every 194 years. They are eight and six times as massive as the Sun, respectively, and have about 3.5 times its diameter. Zeta Muscae is a <a href="A-type%20main-sequence%20star">white main sequence star</a> of spectral type A5V around 330 light-years distant from Earth. It is part of a triple star system with faint companions at 0.5 and 32.4 arc seconds distance. <a href="Eta%20Muscae">Eta Muscae</a> is a multiple star system, the two main components forming an eclipsing binary that has a combined spectral type of B8V and magnitude of 4.77 that dips by 0.05 magnitude every 2.39 days. Alpha, Beta, Gamma, <a href="HD%20103079">HD 103079</a>, Zeta and (likely) Eta are all members of the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup of the <a href="Scorpius%E2%80%93Centaurus%20Association">Scorpius–Centaurus Association</a>, a group of predominantly hot blue-white stars that share a common origin and <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> across the galaxy.

Delta and Epsilon mark the fly's left wing and right wing, respectively. With an apparent magnitude of 3.62, Delta is an orange giant of spectral type K2III located around 91 light-years away. <a href="Epsilon%20Muscae">Epsilon Muscae</a> is a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> of spectral type M5III and semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 3.99 and 4.31 over approximately 40 days. It has expanded to 130 times the Sun's diameter and 1800 to 2300 its luminosity. It was a star originally 1.5 to 2 times as massive as our Sun. Although of a similar distance—around 302 light-years—to the stars of the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup, it is moving much faster at around 100 km/s and does not share a common origin. To the northwest lies Mu Muscae, an orange giant of spectral type K4III that varies between apparent magnitude 4.71 and 4.76, and has been classified as a slow, irregular variable. Near Mu is Lambda Muscae, the third-brightest star in the constellation and a white main-sequence star of spectral type A7V around 128 light-years distant from Earth.

Located near Alpha is <a href="R%20Muscae">R Muscae</a>, a <a href="classical%20Cepheid%20variable">classical Cepheid variable</a> ranging from apparent magnitude 5.93 to 6.73 over 7.5 days. It is a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F7Ib and G2Ib, located around 2037 light-years away. <a href="S%20Muscae">S Muscae</a> is likewise a classical Cepheid, a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F6Ib and G0Ib and magnitudes 5.89 to 6.49 over a period of 9.66 days. A luminous star around 5.9 times as massive as the Sun, it is a binary star with a blue-white main-sequence star companion likely to be of spectral type B3V to B5V with a mass of just over 5 solar masses, one of the hottest and brightest companions of a cepheid known. The two stars orbit each other every 505 days.

<a href="Theta%20Muscae">Theta Muscae</a> is a triple star system thought to be around 7,500 light-years distant. It consists of a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> system composed of the <a href="Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet%20star">Wolf–Rayet star</a> (spectral type: WC5 or 6) and an <a href="O-type%20main-sequence%20star">O-type main-sequence star</a> (spectral type: O6 or O7) that orbit each other every 19 days and a <a href="blue%20supergiant">blue supergiant</a> (spectral type: O9.5/B0Iab) set about 46 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc">milliarcseconds</a> apart from them. If the system's estimated distance from Earth is accurate, the binary stars are about 0.5 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU) apart and the supergiant about 100 AU apart from them. All three are highly luminous; combined, they are likely to be over a million times as luminous as the Sun. <a href="TU%20Muscae">TU Muscae</a> is a binary star system located around 15,500 light-years away made up of two hot, luminous, blue main-sequence stars of spectral types O7.5V and O9.5V, with masses 23 and 15 times that of the Sun. The stars are so close that they are in contact with each other (<a href="Contact%20binary">overcontact binary</a>) and are classed as a <a href="Beta%20Lyrae%20variable">Beta Lyrae variable</a> as their light varies from Earth as they eclipse each other. The system ranges from apparent magnitude 8.17 to 8.75 over around 1.4 days.

Also known as Nova Muscae 1983, <a href="GQ%20Muscae">GQ Muscae</a> is a binary system consisting of a white dwarf and small star that is about 10% as massive as the Sun. The two orbit each other every 1.4 hours. The white dwarf accumulates material from its companion star via its <a href="accretion%20disc">accretion disc</a>. After a certain amount has accumulated, the star erupts, as it did in 1983, reaching a magnitude of 7.2. Discovered with a magnitude of 7.1 on 18 January 1983, it was the first nova from which X-rays were detected. The <a href="soft%20X-ray%20transient">soft X-ray transient</a> <a href="GRS%201124-683">GRS 1124-683</a> (also known as Nova Muscae 1991) is a binary object consisting of an orange main-sequence star (GU Muscae) of spectral type K3V–K4V and a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> of around six solar masses. During the 1991 outburst which led to its discovery, <a href="radiation">radiation</a> was produced through a process of <a href="positron">positron</a> <a href="annihilation">annihilation</a>. <a href="GR%20Muscae">GR Muscae</a> is an X-ray source composed of a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a> of between 1.2 and 1.8 times the mass of our Sun and a low-mass star likely to be around the mass of the Sun in close orbit. Finally, <a href="SY%20Muscae">SY Muscae</a> is a <a href="symbiotic%20nova">symbiotic</a> star system composed of a red giant and white dwarf, where although the larger star is transferring mass to the smaller, no periodic eruption occurs nor does an accretion disc form. The star system varies in magnitude from 10.2 to 12.7 over a period of 624.5 days.

Three star systems have been discovered to have <a href="exoplanets">exoplanets</a>. <a href="HD%20111232">HD 111232</a> is a yellow main-sequence star around 78% as massive as the Sun around 95 light-years distant. It has a planet (<a href="HD%20111232%20b">HD 111232 b</a>) around 6.8 times the mass of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> that has an orbital period around 1143 days. <a href="HD%20112410">HD 112410</a> is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located around 439 light-years distant. With around 1.54 times the mass of our Sun, it is cooling and expanding along the <a href="Stellar%20evolution%23Red-giant-branch%20phase">red-giant branch</a>, having left the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> after exhausting its core supply of hydrogen fuel. It has a substellar companion calculated to have a mass 9.2 times that of Jupiter and an orbital period of 124.6 days at a distance around 0.57 AU. Yet another member of the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup, <a href="HD%20100546">HD 100546</a> is a young, blue-white <a href="Herbig%20Ae/Be%20star">Herbig Ae/Be star</a> of spectral type B9V that has yet to settle on the main sequence—the closest of these stars to Earth around 320 light-years distant. It is surrounded by a circumstellar debris disk from a distance of 0.2 to 4 AU, and again from 13 AU out to a few hundred AU, with evidence for a protoplanet forming at a distance around 47 AU. A gap exists between 4 and 13 AU, which appears to contain a large planet around 20 times the mass of Jupiter, although further examination of the disk profile indicates it might be a more massive object such as a <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> or more than one planet. <a href="LP%20145-141">LP 145-141</a> is a white dwarf located 15 light-years distant—the fourth-closest to the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>. It is considered a good candidate to look for Jupiter-like planets, on account if its proximity and mass.

Located on the border with Circinus is the unusual <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a> <a href="NGC%205189">NGC 5189</a>, estimated to be around 1750 light-years away from Earth. Its complex structure is due to multiple ejections of material from the ageing central star, which are distorted by the presence of a likely binary companion. Located 2.4° east of Eta Muscae is the magnitude-12.9 <a href="Engraved%20Hourglass%20Nebula">Engraved Hourglass Nebula</a> (MyCn 18), which lies about 8000 light-years distant from Earth. To Eta's west lies <a href="IC%204191">IC 4191</a>, a compact bluish planetary nebula of magnitude 10.6, thought to lie around 10,750 light-years away from Earth. West of Epsilon Muscae is <a href="NGC%204071">NGC 4071</a>, a large, diffuse planetary nebula of magnitude 12.7 with a magnitude 12 central star, thought to lie around 4000 light-years away from Earth. The <a href="Coalsack%20Nebula">Coalsack Nebula</a> is a <a href="dark%20nebula">dark nebula</a> located mainly in neighbouring Crux that intrudes into Musca. <a href="NGC%204463">NGC 4463</a> is an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> located on its southwestern border. Around five light-years across, it is located around 3400 light-years away.

The comparatively old <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a> <a href="NGC%204833">NGC 4833</a> near Delta Muscae was catalogued by Lacaille in 1755. It is 21,200 light-years distant and somewhat obscured by dust clouds near the <a href="galactic%20plane">galactic plane</a>. The globular cluster <a href="NGC%204372">NGC 4372</a> near Gamma Muscae is fainter and likewise partially obscured by dust, but spans more <a href="arc%20minute">arc minute</a>s. It is 18,900 light-years away from Earth and 23,000 light-years distant from the centre of the Milky Way. Its extremely low <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> indicates it is very old—one of the oldest clusters in the Milky Way. Extending south from it is the <a href="Dark%20Doodad%20Nebula">Dark Doodad Nebula</a>, resembling a dark L-shaped river through a bright field of stars. Another <a href="dark%20nebula">dark nebula</a> in the constellation is <a href="BHR%2071">BHR 71</a>.

Leo Minor

Leo Minor is a small and faint <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">northern celestial hemisphere</a>. Its name is Latin for "the smaller lion", in contrast to <a href="Leo%20%28constellation%29">Leo</a>, the larger lion. It lies between the larger and more recognizable <a href="Ursa%20Major">Ursa Major</a> to the north and Leo to the south. Leo Minor was not regarded as a separate constellation by classical <a href="Astronomy">astronomers</a>; it was designated by <a href="Johannes%20Hevelius">Johannes Hevelius</a> in 1687.

There are 37 stars brighter than <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 6.5 in the constellation; three are brighter than magnitude 4.5. <a href="46%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLeonis%20Minoris">46 Leonis Minoris</a>, an orange <a href="giant%20star">giant</a> of magnitude 3.8, is located some 95 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth. At magnitude 4.4, <a href="Beta%20Leonis%20Minoris">Beta Leonis Minoris</a> is the second-brightest star and the only one in the constellation with a <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>. It is a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a>, the brighter component of which is an orange giant and the fainter a yellow-white <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> star. The third-brightest star is <a href="21%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLeonis%20Minoris">21 Leonis Minoris</a>, a rapidly rotating <a href="A-type%20main-sequence%20star">white main-sequence star</a> of average magnitude 4.5. The constellation also includes two stars with <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a>s, two pairs of <a href="interacting%20galaxies">interacting galaxies</a>, and the unique <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a> <a href="Hanny%27s%20Voorwerp">Hanny's Voorwerp</a>.

The classical astronomers <a href="Aratus">Aratus</a> and <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> had noted the region of what is now Leo Minor to be undefined and not containing any distinctive pattern; Ptolemy classified the stars in this area as "amorphōtoi" (not belonging to a constellation outline) within the constellation Leo.

<a href="Johannes%20Hevelius">Johannes Hevelius</a> first depicted Leo Minor in 1687 when he outlined ten new constellations in his star atlas "Firmamentum Sobiescianum", and included 18 of its objects in the accompanying "Catalogus Stellarum Fixarum". Hevelius decided upon Leo Minor or Leo Junior as a depiction that would align with its beastly neighbours the Lion and the Great Bear. In 1845, English astronomer <a href="Francis%20Baily">Francis Baily</a> revised the catalogue of Hevelius's new constellations, and assigned a Greek letter known as <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a> to stars brighter than <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 4.5. <a href="Richard%20A.%20Proctor">Richard A. Proctor</a> gave the constellation the name "Leaena" "the Lioness" in 1870, explaining that he sought to shorten the constellation names to make them more manageable on celestial charts.

German astronomer <a href="Christian%20Ludwig%20Ideler">Christian Ludwig Ideler</a> posited that the stars of Leo Minor had been termed "Al Thibā' wa-Aulāduhā" "Gazelle with her Young" on a 13th-century Arabic celestial globe, recovered by Cardinal <a href="Stefano%20Borgia">Stefano Borgia</a> and housed in the prelate's museum at <a href="Velletri">Velletri</a>. Arabist <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Lach">Friedrich Wilhelm Lach</a> describes a different view, noting that they had been seen as "Al Haud" "the Pond", which the Gazelle jumps into. In <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a>, the stars Beta, 30, 37 and 46 Leonis Minoris made up "Neiping", a "Court of Judge or Mediator", or "Shi" "Court Eunuch" or were combined with stars of the neighbouring Leo to make up a large celestial dragon or State Chariot. A line of four stars was known as "Shaowei"; it represented four Imperial advisors and may have been located in Leo Minor, Leo or adjacent regions.

A dark area of the sky with a triangle of brighter stars just visible to the naked eye in good conditions, Leo Minor has been described by <a href="Patrick%20Moore">Patrick Moore</a> as having "dubious claims to a separate identity". It is a small constellation bordered by <a href="Ursa%20Major">Ursa Major</a> to the north, <a href="Lynx%20%28constellation%29">Lynx</a> to the west, <a href="Leo%20%28constellation%29">Leo</a> to the south, and touching the corner of <a href="Cancer%20%28constellation%29">Cancer</a> to the southwest. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'LMi'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 16 <a href="Edge%20%28geometry%29">sides</a>. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between 22.84° and 41.43°. Ranked 64th out of 88 constellations in size, Leo Minor covers an area of 232.0 square degrees, or 0.562 percent of the sky. It <a href="Culmination">culminates</a> each year at midnight on February 24, and at 9 p.m. on May 24.

There are only three <a href="star">star</a>s in the constellation brighter than magnitude 4.5, and 37 stars with a magnitude brighter than 6.5. Leo Minor does not have a star designated Alpha because Baily erred and allocated a Greek letter to only one star, Beta. It is unclear whether he intended to give <a href="46%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLeonis%20Minoris">46 Leonis Minoris</a> a Bayer designation, as he recognized Beta and 46 Leonis Minoris as of the appropriate brightness in his catalogue. He died before revising his proofs, which might explain this star's omission.

At magnitude 3.8, the brightest star in Leo Minor is an orange <a href="giant%20star">giant</a> of <a href="Stellar%20classification">spectral class</a> K0III named 46 Leonis Minoris or Praecipua; its colour is evident when seen through binoculars. Situated from Earth, it has around 32 times the <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> and is 8.5 times the size of the Sun. It was also catalogued and named as o Leonis Minoris by <a href="Johann%20Elert%20Bode">Johann Elert Bode</a>, which has been misinterpreted as Omicron Leonis Minoris. More confusion occurred with its proper name "Praecipua", which appears to have been originally applied to <a href="37%20Leonis%20Minoris">37 Leonis Minoris</a> in the 1814 "Palermo Catalogue" of <a href="Giuseppe%20Piazzi">Giuseppe Piazzi</a>, who mistakenly assessed the latter star as the brighter. This name was later connected by Allen with 46 Leonis Minoris—an error perpetuated by subsequent astronomers. The original "Praecipua", 37 Leonis Minoris, has an apparent magnitude of 4.69, but is a distant yellow <a href="supergiant">supergiant</a> of spectral type G2.5IIa and absolute magnitude of −1.84, around distant.
<a href="Beta%20Leonis%20Minoris">Beta Leonis Minoris</a> is a binary star system. The primary is a giant star of spectral class G8 and apparent magnitude of 4.4. It has around double the mass, 7.8 times the radius and 36 times the luminosity of the Earth's Sun. Separated by 11 seconds of arc from the primary, the secondary is a <a href="F-type%20main-sequence%20star">yellow-white main sequence star</a> of spectral type F8. The two orbit around a common <a href="Barycentric%20coordinates%20%28astronomy%29">centre of gravity</a> every 38.62 years, and lie away from the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>.

Around away and around 10 times as luminous as the Sun, <a href="21%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLeonis%20Minoris">21 Leonis Minoris</a> is a rapidly rotating <a href="A-type%20main-sequence%20star">white main-sequence star</a>, spinning on its axis in less than 12 hours and very likely flattened in shape. Of average apparent magnitude 4.5 and spectral type A7V, it is a <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a>. These are short period (six hours at most) <a href="Variable%20star%23Pulsating%20variable%20stars">pulsating</a> stars which have been used as <a href="Cosmic%20distance%20ladder%23Standard%20candles">standard candles</a> and as subjects to study <a href="asteroseismology">asteroseismology</a>.

Also known as SU and SV Leonis Minoris, <a href="10%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLeonis%20Minoris">10</a> and <a href="11%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLeonis%20Minoris">11 Leonis Minoris</a> are yellow giants of spectral type G8III, with average magnitudes 4.54 and 5.34 respectively. Both are <a href="RS%20Canum%20Venaticorum%20variable">RS Canum Venaticorum</a> variables, with 10 Leonis Minoris varying by 0.012 magnitude over 40.4 days, and 11 Leonis Minoris by 0.033 magnitude over 18 days. 11 Leonis Minoris has a <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> companion of spectral type M5V and apparent magnitude 13.0. <a href="20%20Leonis%20Minoris">20 Leonis Minoris</a> is a multiple star system away from the Sun. The main star is another yellow star, this time a <a href="G-type%20main-sequence%20star">dwarf</a> of spectral type G3Va and apparent magnitude 5.4. The companion is an old, active red dwarf that has a relatively high <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> and is of spectral type M6.5. The fact that the secondary star is brighter than expected indicates it is likely two stars very close together that are unable to be made out separately with current viewing technology.

<a href="R%20Leonis%20Minoris">R</a> and <a href="S%20Leonis%20Minoris">S Leonis Minoris</a> are long-period <a href="Mira%20variable">Mira variable</a>s, while <a href="U%20Leonis%20Minoris">U Leonis Minoris</a> is a <a href="Semiregular%20variable%20star">semiregular variable</a>; all three are <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a>s of spectral types M6.5e-M9.0e, M5e and M6 respectively. R varies between magnitudes 6.3 and 13.2 during a period of 372 days, S varies between magnitudes 8.6 and 13.9 during a period of 234 days, and U varies between magnitudes 10.0 and 13.3 during a period of 272 days. The lack of bright stars makes finding these objects challenging for amateur astronomers. <a href="G%20117-B15A">G 117-B15A</a>, also known as RY Leonis Minoris, is a <a href="pulsating%20white%20dwarf">pulsating white dwarf</a> of apparent magnitude 15.5. With a period of approximately 215 seconds, and losing a second every 8.9 million years, the 400-million-year-old star has been proposed as the most stable celestial clock.

<a href="SX%20Leonis%20Minoris">SX Leonis Minoris</a> is a <a href="dwarf%20nova">dwarf nova</a> of the SU Ursae Majoris type that was identified in 1994. It consists of a white dwarf and a donor star, which orbit each other every 97 minutes. The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star onto an <a href="accretion%20disc">accretion disc</a> and heats up to between 6000 and 10000 K. The dwarf star erupts every 34 to 64 days, reaching magnitude 13.4 in these outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.8 when quiet. Leo Minor contains another dwarf nova, <a href="RZ%20Leonis%20Minoris">RZ Leonis Minoris</a>, which brightens to magnitude 14.2 from a baseline magnitude of around 17 but does so at shorter intervals than other dwarf novae.

Two stars with planetary systems have been found. <a href="HD%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B87883">HD 87883</a> is an orange dwarf of magnitude 7.57 and spectral type K0V 18 parsecs distant from Earth. With a diameter three quarters that of Earth's sun, it is only 31 percent as luminous. It is orbited by a planet around 1.78 times the mass of Jupiter every 7.9 years, and there are possibly other smaller planets. <a href="HD%2082886">HD 82886</a> is a yellow dwarf of spectral type G0 and visual magnitude 7.63. A planet 1.3 times the mass of Jupiter and orbiting every 705 days was discovered in 2011.

In terms of <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a>s, Leo Minor contains many galaxies viewable in amateur telescopes. Located 3 degrees southeast of <a href="38%20Leonis%20Minoris">38 Leonis Minoris</a>, <a href="NGC%203432">NGC 3432</a> is seen nearly edge on. Known as the knitting needle galaxy, it is of apparent magnitude 11.7 and measures 6.8 by 1.4 arcminutes. Located 42 million light-years away, it is moving away from the Solar System at a rate of 616 km per second. In 2000, a star within the galaxy brightened to magnitude 17.4, and has since been determined to be a <a href="luminous%20blue%20variable">luminous blue variable</a> and <a href="supernova%20impostor">supernova impostor</a>. <a href="NGC%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3003">NGC 3003</a>, a SBbc <a href="barred%20spiral%20galaxy">barred spiral galaxy</a> with an apparent magnitude of 12.3 and an angular size of 5.8 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc">arcminutes</a>, is seen almost edge-on. <a href="NGC%203344">NGC 3344</a>, 25 million light-years distant, is face-on towards Earth. Measuring 7.1 by 6.5 arcminutes in size, it has an apparent magnitude of 10.45. <a href="NGC%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3504">NGC 3504</a> is a <a href="starburst%20galaxy">starburst</a> barred spiral galaxy of apparent magnitude 11.67 and measuring 2.1 by 2.7 arcminutes. It has hosted supernovae in 1998 and 2001. It and the <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> <a href="NGC%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3486">NGC 3486</a> are also almost face-on towards Earth; the latter is of magnitude 11.05 and measures 7.1 by 5.2 arcminutes. <a href="NGC%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2859">NGC 2859</a> is an SB0-type <a href="lenticular%20galaxy">lenticular galaxy</a>.

At least two pairs of interacting galaxies have been observed. <a href="Arp%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B107">Arp 107</a> is a pair of galaxies in the process of merging, located 450 million light-years away. <a href="NGC%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3395">NGC 3395</a> and <a href="NGC%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3396">NGC 3396</a> are a spiral and irregular barred spiral galaxy, respectively, that are interacting, located 1.33 degrees southwest of 46 Leonis Minoris.

The unique deep-sky object known as <a href="Hanny%27s%20Voorwerp">Hanny's Voorwerp</a> was discovered in Leo Minor in 2007 by Dutch school teacher Hanny van Arkel while participating as a volunteer in the <a href="Galaxy%20Zoo">Galaxy Zoo</a> project. Lying near the 650-million-light-year-distant spiral galaxy <a href="IC%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2497">IC 2497</a>, it is around the same size as the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. It contains a 16,000-light-year-wide hole. The voorwerp is thought to be the visual light echo of a <a href="quasar">quasar</a> now gone inactive, possibly as recently as 200,000 years ago.

Discovered by Dick McCloskey and Annette Posen of the Harvard Meteor Program in 1959, the <a href="Leonis%20Minorids">Leonis Minorid</a> meteor shower peaks between October 18 and October 29. The shower's parent body is the long period comet <a href="C/1739%20K1%20%28Zanotti%29">C/1739 K1 (Zanotti)</a>. It is a minor shower, and can only be seen from the Northern Hemisphere.

1956 Winter Olympics

The 1956 Winter Olympics, officially known as the VII Olympic Winter Games (French: Les "VII Jeux olympiques d'hiver"; Italian: "VII Giochi olimpici invernali"), was a <a href="Winter%20Olympic%20Games">multi-sport event</a> held in <a href="Cortina%20d%27Ampezzo">Cortina d'Ampezzo</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, from 26 January to 5 February 1956.

Cortina, which had originally been awarded the <a href="1944%20Winter%20Olympics">1944 Winter Olympics</a>, beat out <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="Colorado%20Springs%2C%20Colorado">Colorado Springs</a> and <a href="Lake%20Placid%2C%20New%20York">Lake Placid</a> for the right to host the 1956 Games. The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues were within walking distance of each other. The organising committee received financial support from the Italian government for infrastructure improvements, but the rest of the costs for the Games had to be privately financed. Consequently, the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship for funding.

Thirty-two nations—the largest number of countries participating in the Winter Olympics until then—competed in the four sports and twenty-four events. <a href="Austria%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Austrian</a> <a href="Toni%20Sailer">Toni Sailer</a> became the first person to sweep all three alpine skiing events in a single Olympics. The figure skating competition was held outdoors for the last time at these Games. Logistically, the only problem encountered was a lack of snow at the alpine skiing events. To remedy this, the Italian army transported large amounts of snow to ensure the courses were adequately covered.

Politics did not affect the 1956 Winter Games as at the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">Summer Games</a> in Melbourne, Australia, where the Soviet repression of the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">Hungarian Revolution</a> and the <a href="Suez%20War">Suez War</a> caused many nations to boycott the Games. The Cortina Olympics were the first Winter Olympics televised to a multi-national audience. These were the first Olympic Games under the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">IOC</a> Presidency of <a href="Avery%20Brundage">Avery Brundage</a>.

Cortina d'Ampezzo is a ski resort village situated in the <a href="Dolomite%20Alps">Dolomite Alps</a> in the north-eastern corner of Italy. In 1956, it had a population of 6,500 people. Count <a href="Alberto%20Bonacossa">Alberto Bonacossa</a>, an accomplished alpine skier, figure skater and a member of the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC) since 1925, spearheaded the effort to bring the Olympic Games to Cortina d'Ampezzo. He persuaded the city council of Cortina to bid for the <a href="1944%20Winter%20Olympics">1944 Games</a>. During the 38th <a href="IOC%20Session">IOC Congress</a> held in London in 1939, Cortina d'Ampezzo was awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics, but the Games were canceled due to the outbreak of World War II.

In 1946 the Italian Winter Sports Federation convened in <a href="Milan">Milan</a> and decided to support a new attempt from Cortina to host the Winter Games. A delegation, led by Count Bonacossa, presented Cortina's bid to host the <a href="1952%20Winter%20Olympics">1952 Winter Olympics</a> at the 40th IOC Session in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Sweden. They were backed by the city's council and the <a href="Italian%20National%20Olympic%20Committee">Italian National Olympic Committee</a> (CONI, "Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano"). A rival bid from <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, Norway, soundly defeated Cortina. Count Bonacossa's and CONI prepared a third bid, this time for the 1956 Winter Games. The host city selection took place in Rome, during the 43rd IOC Session. On 28 April 1949, Cortina d'Ampezzo was selected with 75% of the votes, over bids from <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="Colorado%20Springs%2C%20Colorado">Colorado Springs</a> and <a href="Lake%20Placid%2C%20New%20York">Lake Placid</a>. Unfortunately, Bonacossa died on 30 January 1953, three years before he could witness Cortina host the Games.

A total of 32 nations sent athletes to Cortina d'Ampezzo. Along with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="Iran">Iran</a> competed at the Winter Games for the first time, making Bolivia the first completely Tropical nation to participate in a Winter Olympic. Korea, Liechtenstein, and Turkey returned after having missed the <a href="1952%20Winter%20Olympics">1952 Winter Olympics</a>, while Argentina, Denmark, New Zealand, and Portugal did not compete at these Games, after having participated in the previous edition. Athletes from <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> (FRG) and <a href="German%20Democratic%20Republic">East Germany</a> (GDR) competed together as the <a href="United%20Team%20of%20Germany">United Team of Germany</a>, an arrangement that would continue for the following two <a href="Olympiads">Olympiads</a>.

Below is the list of participating nations, with the number of competitors indicated in brackets:

These are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1956 Winter Olympics:

The 1956 Winter Olympics was organised by a committee composed of members of the Italian National Olympic Committee and the Italian government. Observers were sent to the Oslo Games in 1952 to collect information regarding the sports programme, infrastructure, and accommodation requirements. The intelligence gathered there indicated that Cortina's facilities were not up to Olympic standards. The town did not have an ice stadium, or a speed skating rink; the alpine ski runs, ski jump and bobsleigh run were in poor condition. Cortina was a small village, and its infrastructure would be overwhelmed by the crowds expected for the Games. To accommodate the influx of people, new roads and rail lines had to be built, and the city's power grid and telephone lines expanded. Enhancements also had to be made to sewer and water capacity. The Italian government supplied <a href="Italian%20lira">Italian lira</a> 460 million for infrastructure improvements. The Italian Olympic Committee was responsible for funding the rest of the costs of hosting the Games. They did this by setting aside monies from their own budget, ticket sales, and even culling funds from local football betting pools. The organising committee also took the unprecedented step of selling corporate sponsorship. For example, <a href="Fiat">Fiat</a> was designated the official car of the 1956 Winter Olympics, and <a href="Olivetti">Olivetti</a> supplied typewriters for the 400 journalists attending the Games.

The <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> began after the allied victory in World War II. Until 1952, many of the Communist countries of Eastern Europe had participated in <a href="Socialist%20Workers%27%20Sport%20International">Worker's Olympics</a> or <a href="Spartakiads">Spartakiads</a>. The Soviet Union emerged from <a href="international%20isolation">international isolation</a> by eschewing the Spartakiad and participating in the <a href="1952%20Summer%20Olympics">1952 Summer Olympics</a> in Helsinki; they made their Winter Olympics debut at the Cortina Games. <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet general secretary</a> <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>'s aim was to use international sports competitions, such as the Olympics, to demonstrate the superiority of communism, strengthen political ties with other communist countries, and project the Soviet Union as a peace-loving nation actively engaged in the world. The Soviets' participation at the Olympics raised the level of competition as they won the most medals and more gold medals than any other nation. The Cortina Games were held before the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">Hungarian Revolution</a> and subsequent Soviet invasion, and the <a href="Suez%20War">Suez War</a>, which occurred in the autumn of 1956; the Winter Games escaped the boycotts that plagued the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympic%20Games">Melbourne Olympics</a>, which were celebrated in November and December of that year.

The Cortina Games were the first Winter Olympics to be broadcast to a multi-national audience. Television as a mass communication technology was expanding rapidly in the 1950s. In the midst of the Cold War, Europe was a propaganda battlefield as countries relayed television signals across the <a href="Iron%20Curtain">Iron Curtain</a>. By 1956, countries in the Soviet <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">sphere of influence</a> had achieved a technological advantage and were able to broadcast communist television programmes into Finland, the eastern border regions and more isolated geographic areas of West Germany and Austria, where residents had coverage from an East German broadcast with a pro-communist point-of-view. Most West Germans watched the 1956 Winter Olympics via Eurovision broadcasts which were relayed all over western Europe including all major West German stations (Eurovision connectivity in 1956 ) The political ramifications were not the only impact television had these Olympics. The Cortina Games did not generate revenue from television – the <a href="1960%20Winter%20Olympics">1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley</a> were the first to do so – but were an experiment in the feasibility of televising a large multi-sport event. For the first time at an Olympic Games, the venues were built with television in mind. For example, the grand stand at the cross-country ski venue ("Lo Stadio della neve") was built facing south so that the television cameras would not be adversely affected by the rising or setting sun.

Medals were awarded in 24 events contested in 4 sports (8 disciplines). The programme for the 1956 Winter Games saw two new events added to the four sports and twenty-two events from the 1952 Olympics, namely the men's 30 kilometre <a href="Cross-country%20skiing%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">cross-country</a> ski race and the women's 3x5 kilometre cross-country relay race.

The <a href="Olympic%20Games%20ceremony">opening ceremonies</a> took place on Thursday, 26 January 1956 in the <a href="Stadio%20Olimpico%20Del%20Ghiaccio">Olympic Ice Stadium</a>. Temporary seating was added to boost the stadium's capacity to 14,000 people. Athletes representing 32 nations marched in the ceremony and Mr <a href="Giovanni%20Gronchi">Giovanni Gronchi</a>, President of the Italian Republic, declared the Games open. At this point, speed skater Guido Caroli skated into the stadium with the Olympic flame. While he was on a circuit of the Ice Stadium he tripped and fell over a television cable; he regained his feet and lit the cauldron. The Olympic oath was delivered by <a href="Giuliana%20Chenal-Minuzzo">Giuliana Chenal-Minuzzo</a>; this was the first time a female athlete gave the oath at an Olympic Games. The <a href="Olympic%20Hymn">Olympic Hymn</a>, officially recognised as such at the IOC congress in Paris on 13 June 1955, was played for the first time at the Cortina Games.

There were two bobsleigh events, the two-man and four-man competitions. Every participating nation was limited to two sleighs in each event. The sleighs made four runs, with the total time summed. The <a href="Italy%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Italians</a> won gold and silver in the two-man event. <a href="Switzerland%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Switzerland</a> took third place when they passed <a href="Spain%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Spain</a> on the fourth run. In the four-man event held a week later, the Swiss won the gold medal, Italy picked up the silver, and the <a href="United%20States%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">United States</a> won the bronze. Italy had participated in all six previous Olympic bobsleigh competitions but had never reached the podium. Italians <a href="Renzo%20Alver%C3%A0">Renzo Alverà</a> and <a href="Eugenio%20Monti">Eugenio Monti</a> won the silver in the two-man competition and were also on the silver-winning four-man sleigh. Monti's silver medals at the 1956 Games were the first of six Olympic medals he would win in his bobsleigh career. The <a href="Eugenio%20Monti%20track">bobsleigh run</a> at Cortina was eventually renamed the Eugenio Monti track to honour his bobsleigh career. The medals won in bobsleigh would be the host nation's only medals at these Games. One complaint of the bobsleigh events was that the track surface suffered extensive damage due to overuse. This hampered the performance of teams drawn late in the competition.

The eighth Olympic ice hockey tournament also served as both the European and World Championships. Split into three pools before the tournament, the ten participating nations began by playing each team in their pool in a <a href="Round%20robin%20tournament">round robin</a> format. The top two teams from each pool advanced to the final round, with the remaining teams played in a consolation group for 7th through 10th places. <a href="Canada%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Canada</a>, <a href="Czechoslovakia%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Czechoslovakia</a>, and the Soviet Union took first place in their preliminary pools with undefeated records. <a href="Germany%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Germany</a>, the United States, and <a href="Sweden%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Sweden</a> took second place in their pools.

An important early matchup of the final round was the game between Canada and the United States. The Canadians had never lost to the US in Olympic play prior to that game. In what was considered a tremendous upset, the United States defeated Canada 4–1. The Americans, who placed fourth at the <a href="1955%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1955 World Ice Hockey Championships</a> and were not expected to medal, then faced the USSR, who won the tournament in <a href="1954%20Ice%20Hockey%20World%20Championships">1954</a> and took silver in <a href="1955%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1955</a> behind Canada, in a game that would eventually make the difference in the gold medal. The Soviets overwhelmed the underdogs and won the match 4–0. The USSR then played Canada, who still had a chance to win the gold if they defeated the Soviets, and won 2–0 despite being dramatically outscored in the first and second periods. The USSR won gold, the United States surpisingly took silver and Canada, with their two losses, earned bronze, their worst result to date in Olympic play.

The Cortina Games were the last Olympics to feature figure skating outdoors. Skaters from the United States won five medals, sweeping the men's event and taking the top two spots in the ladies' event. <a href="Tenley%20Albright">Tenley Albright</a> was the women's Olympic champion despite sustaining a serious injury in practice. Less than two weeks before the Olympics she was practicing her skating routine when she hit a rut in the ice and fell. Her skate cut through several layers of clothing, and sliced her right leg at the ankle. Her teammate <a href="Carol%20Heiss">Carol Heiss</a> won the silver, and <a href="Austria%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Austrian</a> <a href="Ingrid%20Wendl">Ingrid Wendl</a> earned the bronze medal. Americans <a href="Hayes%20Jenkins">Hayes Jenkins</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Robertson%20%28figure%20skater%29">Ronald Robertson</a>, and Jenkins' brother <a href="David%20Jenkins%20%28figure%20skater%29">David Jenkins</a> were the men's medallists. The Austrian pair of <a href="Sissy%20Schwarz">Sissy Schwarz</a> and <a href="Kurt%20Oppelt">Kurt Oppelt</a> took the gold medal in the pairs event. Canadians <a href="Frances%20Dafoe">Frances Dafoe</a> and <a href="Norris%20Bowden">Norris Bowden</a> won the silver and the <a href="Hungary%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Hungarian</a> siblings <a href="Marianna%20Nagy%20%28figure%20skater%29">Marianna Nagy</a> and <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Nagy%20%28figure%20skater%29">László Nagy</a> defended their bronze medal from the 1952 Games.

The Soviet Union dominated the speed skating events by winning seven of the twelve medals, including four golds. Soviet skaters set two world records, an Olympic record, and had at least one medallist in each of the four events. <a href="Yevgeny%20Grishin%20%28speed%20skater%29">Yevgeny Grishin</a> was the top individual performer, with two gold medals and two world records. Grishin and Soviet teammate <a href="Yuri%20Mikhaylov">Yuri Mikhaylov</a> tied in the 1,500 metre race. It was decided to award both of the athletes gold medals and leave the silver medal position vacant. <a href="Sigvard%20Ericsson">Sigvard Ericsson</a> of Sweden earned gold and silver medals and set an Olympic record in the 10,000 metre event.

Six alpine skiing events were held, three for men and three for women. The races were the downhill, slalom and giant slalom. <a href="Toni%20Sailer">Toni Sailer</a> of Austria swept the men's gold medals, becoming the first person to win three alpine skiing golds in a single Olympics. Led by Sailer, the Austrians dominated the alpine skiing events for both men and women, winning nine out of a possible eighteen medals. The Austrians were particularly successful in the giant slalom; the men swept the medals and the women took silver and bronze. <a href="Chiharu%20Igaya">Chiharu Igaya</a> won the first Winter Olympics medal for <a href="Japan%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Japan</a> when he placed second in the slalom. Swiss teammates, <a href="Madeleine%20Berthod">Madeleine Berthod</a> and <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Colliard">Renée Colliard</a> won the women's downhill and slalom races. Germany earned its only gold medal of the Games when <a href="Ossi%20Reichert">Ossi Reichert</a> took first in the giant slalom.

Two women's events were added to the cross-country skiing programme for the first time. The Soviet women took the top two spots in the individual 10 kilometre race but lost to Finland in the new 3x5 kilometre relay. The men had a new event as well, the 30 kilometre race, which was won by <a href="Veikko%20Hakulinen">Veikko Hakulinen</a> from Finland. The other three men's events were won by three different nations: <a href="Norway%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Norway</a> took the 15 kilometre race, Sweden the 50 kilometre event, and the Soviet Union won the relay. Overall the Soviet Union won seven out of a possible eighteen medals in cross-country skiing. Sweden, behind the strong skiing of <a href="Sixten%20Jernberg">Sixten Jernberg</a>, won six medals. Jernberg won a gold, two silvers, and a bronze, which were the first of nine Olympic medals he would earn in his cross-country career.

There were significant changes to the Nordic combined event at the 1956 Games. The event had always been a cross-country race followed by a ski jump. Originally the competitors in the Nordic combined were entered into the open 18 kilometre cross-country race, which meant that they competed alongside athletes who were dedicated cross-country skiers. Their times were combined with their score from two ski jumps to determine the winner. At the Cortina Games, the format was altered to allow the Nordic combined athletes to compete in a dedicated 15 kilometre cross-country race. Two days later they had three jumps on the ski jump hill. Their best two scores were combined with their cross-country time to determine a winner. This format would become the standard for Nordic combined competitions going forward. Norway continued its dominance of Nordic combined when <a href="Sverre%20Stenersen">Sverre Stenersen</a> won the gold medal. Since its inception at the <a href="1924%20Winter%20Olympics">1924 Games</a>, the country had only lost the Nordic combined event once. Stenersen was followed by <a href="Bengt%20Eriksson">Bengt Eriksson</a> of Sweden and <a href="Poland%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Poland</a>'s <a href="Franciszek%20G%C4%85sienica%20Gro%C5%84">Franciszek Gąsienica Groń</a>.

In the ski jumping event, the Swiss jumper, <a href="Andreas%20D%C3%A4scher">Andreas Däscher</a> introduced a <a href="Daescher%20technique">new style</a> of jumping, which would soon come to be known as the Däscher technique. Before these Games, the athletes would hold their arms forward over their heads. Däscher reasoned that if the athlete held his arms at his side he would fly farther. Adherents to this new style dominated the competition. Finnish jumpers <a href="Antti%20Hyv%C3%A4rinen">Antti Hyvärinen</a> and <a href="Aulis%20K%C3%A4llakorpi">Aulis Källakorpi</a> took first and second place; <a href="Harry%20Glass">Harry Glass</a> of Germany won the bronze medal. This competition marked the end of Norwegian dominance in the sport. Since the first winter Games in 1924, the Norwegians had won the gold medal at each Olympics until 1956. The poor performance of the Norwegian jumpers was attributed to their refusal to use the new jumping technique.

The closing ceremonies took place on Sunday, 5 February in the <a href="Stadio%20Olimpico%20Del%20Ghiaccio">Olympic Ice Stadium</a>. They were preceded by a figure skating exhibition performed by the men's, women's, and pairs figure skating champions. The flag bearers of each nation then entered the stadium followed by the flags of Greece and the United States. These two flags were raised to honor the nation that founded the Olympics and the next country to host the Winter Games. <a href="Avery%20Brundage">Avery Brundage</a>, President of the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a>, declared the Olympics closed, and a fireworks display concluded the Games.

The opening ceremony was held on 26 January, along with the first games of the hockey tournament. From 27 January until 5 February, the day of the closing ceremony, at least one event final was held each day.

† The numeral indicates the number of event finals for each sport held that day.

A unique feature of the Cortina Olympics was the proximity of many event locations which were in walking distance of each other within the town of Cortina. The speed skating events were held at <a href="Lake%20Misurina">Lake Misurina</a>, roughly from Cortina. The venues featured grandstands heated by silica coils built into the seats. Silica coil heating was a technology that had only recently become economical. The competitions were held without incident except for the skiing events, which suffered from a lack of snow.

A notable venue not found at the 1956 Games was an Olympic Village, where the athletes would be housed. The town of Cortina d'Ampezzo had a population of less than 7,000 people in 1956. Local hotels were concerned that after the Olympics an Olympic Village would so significantly increase the hotel capacity it would put many of them out of business. Athletes were billeted by local families or stayed in hotels during the Games.

The Olympic Ice Stadium ("<a href="Stadio%20Olimpico%20Del%20Ghiaccio">Stadio Olimpico Del Ghiaccio</a>") was intended to be the focal point of the Games. It was built on the banks of the Boite river just north of Cortina. After new roads and a bridge had been constructed, the stadium was an eight-minute walk from the center of town. The stadium was built to accommodate 6,000–7,000 people. Due to space limitations the grandstands were constructed vertically, with tiers built directly on top of each other. There were two artificial ice rinks of , with a total ice surface of . A special cooling plant was built under the stadium, which froze the ice through the evaporation of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>. The construction cost totaled <a href="Italian%20lira">ITL</a> 1.3 billion (US$2.1 million in 1956), making it the most expensive venue of these Games. The stadium was used for the opening and closing ceremonies, all of the figure skating competitions and select ice hockey events. After the Games, the organising committee made the Ice Stadium a gift to the city of Cortina. It was used as an ice skating rink in the winter and an outdoor gymnasium for <a href="judo">judo</a> and gymnastics in the summer.

The "<a href="Apollonio%20Stadium">Apollonio Stadium</a>" was used for select games of the ice hockey tournament. Considerable work had to be done to bring the stadium up to date. A second rink was added to allow for two games to be held simultaneously. The stadium was outfitted with electric lights and the seating capacity was enlarged to accommodate 2,000 people.

The bobsleigh run ("<a href="Eugenio%20Monti%20track">Pista Olimpica di Bob – Eugenio Monti</a>"), was originally constructed in 1928. The track was rebuilt and expanded several times during the years leading up to the Olympics. A state-of-the-art signal board was installed displaying a diagram of the run with the position of each sleigh on the run shown with lights.

Situated around from Cortina, near Zuel, the "Italia" Jump ("<a href="Trampolino%20Olimpico">Trampolino Olimpico Italia</a>") was originally built in 1923 as the "Franchetti" Jump. After modifications in 1926, the first structure was demolished in 1939 and rebuilt in 1940. With the 1956 Games coming to Cortina, the jump had to be updated again to comply with the technical demands of the Olympics. On April 15, 1955, the "Franchetti" Jump was finally demolished and the new "Italia Jump" was completed in the same year at a cost of nearly ITL 310 million ($500,000). The reinforced concrete platform was high, and possessed a long, 35° steep in-run. Two grandstands, each with a capacity for 3,000 people, were placed on either side of the landing slope; a natural amphiteatre at the bottom of the hill could hold up to 40,000 standing spectators. A special road was built between Cortina and the venue for the transport of athletes, officials and authorities.

The Snow Stadium ("<a href="Lo%20Stadio%20della%20neve">Stadio della neve</a>") was constructed from Cortina, and hosted all of the cross-country events. Two grandstands were constructed to accommodate 6,000 people. Three types of cross-country courses were constructed: one of , three of , and four of . Some of these courses went through the <a href="Bobsleigh%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">bobsleigh</a> run. As a result, a bridge had to be constructed so events occurring in the two venues would not interfere with each other.

The alpine runs ("<a href="Alpine%20skiing%20at%20the%201956%20Winter%20Olympics">Le piste alpine</a>") were built on the slopes of <a href="Tofane">Monte Tofana</a> and <a href="Mount%20Faloria">Monte Faloria</a> in the nearby Dolomite alps. The men's and women's downhill and slalom races were held on Tofana. Faloria was the site of the two giant slalom events. It took nearly two years to complete construction of the runs. In previous years, lack of snow was never an issue, but in the winter of 1956 there was insufficient snowfall for skiers to safely navigate the runs. As a consequence, snow had to be transported from other parts of the mountains by the Italian army.

The Misurina rink ("<a href="Lake%20Misurina">La pista di Misurina</a>") was the location of the speed skating events. This was the last time that speed skating at the Olympics was held on natural ice. It was from Cortina. The rink was established at the northern end of the lake with a mountain backdrop. Stands were constructed to accommodate 8,500 people. Despite the event being held outdoors on lake ice, two world records and two Olympic records were broken during the competition.

Three of the venues for these games (the bobsleigh run, indoor arena, and ski jump) would serve as film location for the 1981 <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> film "<a href="For%20Your%20Eyes%20Only%20%28film%29">For Your Eyes Only</a>".

Forest raven

The forest raven ("Corvus tasmanicus", also commonly known as the Tasmanian raven) is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird in the family <a href="Corvidae">Corvidae</a> native to Tasmania and parts of southern <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, such as <a href="Wilsons%20Promontory">Wilsons Promontory</a> and <a href="Portland%2C%20Victoria">Portland</a>. Populations are also found in parts of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, including <a href="Dorrigo%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Dorrigo</a> and <a href="Armidale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Armidale</a>. Measuring in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and legs. As with the other two species of raven in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, its black feathers have grey bases. Adults have white <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a>es; younger birds have dark brown and then hazel irises with an inner blue rim. New South Wales populations are recognised as a separate subspecies "C. tasmanicus boreus", but appear to be nested within the Tasmanian subspecies genetically.

The forest raven lives in a wide variety of habitats in Tasmania but is restricted to more closed forest on mainland Australia. Breeding takes place in spring and summer, occurring later in Tasmania than in New South Wales. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree. An <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a> and opportunistic feeder, it eats a wide variety of plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas and roadkill. It has been blamed for killing lambs and poultry and raiding orchards in Tasmania, and is unprotected under Tasmanian legislation. The forest raven is sedentary, with pairs generally bonding for life and establishing permanent territories.

<a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> described the "South-Seas raven" in 1781, with loose throat feathers and found in "the Friendly Isles" in the South Seas, but did not give a binomial name. Although "the Friendly Isles" refers to Tonga, the specimen resembles what is now known as the forest raven and was collected by ships' surgeon <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28naturalist%29">William Anderson</a> on the <a href="third%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">third voyage of James Cook</a> in January 1777. Of the species, he had written, "Crows, nearly the same as ours in England". Tasked as the expedition's naturalist, Anderson collected many bird specimens but had died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in 1778 before the return home. Many collection localities were incorrect, and notes were lost or pieced together many years later. German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> gave the species the name "Corvus australis" in the 13th edition of "Systema naturae" in 1788.

Since Australia was settled by Europeans, all species of crows and ravens have been colloquially known as crows by the general population and are difficult to distinguish. In his 1865 "<a href="Handbook%20to%20the%20Birds%20of%20Australia">Handbook to the Birds of Australia</a>", <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> noted a single species of corvid in Australia, "Corvus australis", which he called the white-eyed crow. He used Gmelin's 1788 name, which took precedence by virtue of its age over Vigors and Horsfield's description. In 1912 Scottish naturalist <a href="William%20Robert%20Ogilvie-Grant">William Robert Ogilvie-Grant</a> clarified the species as "C. coronoides" (raven, and incorporating <a href="little%20raven">little</a> and <a href="Australian%20raven">Australian raven</a>s) and "C. cecilae" (<a href="Torresian%20crow">Torresian crow</a>). Subsequently, French-American ornithologist <a href="Charles%20Vaurie">Charles Vaurie</a> acted as <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature%23Principle%20of%20the%20First%20Reviser">First Revisor</a> under Article 24 of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Code of Zoological Nomenclature</a> (ICZN) Code and discarded "C. australis" as a junior homonym—in 1788, Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the <a href="black%20nunbird">black nunbird</a>—to preserve the stability of the name. This has been followed by later authors.

<a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> described the forest raven as a distinct subspecies—"Corvus marianae tasmanicus"—of the Australian raven in 1912, its species name derived from Tasmania, the type locality. Rowley raised the forest raven to species rank in 1970, noting there were no intermediate forms between it and the little raven (its closest relative) and that it was clearly larger with a much more massive bill. He described a second subspecies—"Corvus tasmanicus boreus"—the same year, observing that "C. tasmanicus" from Tasmania and southern Victoria has a very short tail compared with individuals from the northern New South Wales population. Rowley gave the species name forest raven in 1970. The term "crow" is colloquially applied to any or all species of Australian corvid.

Preliminary genetic analysis of the genus using <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another, and that the two lineages are not closely related. The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the forest raven may be <a href="Conspecificity">conspecific</a> with the Australian raven. Subsequent multigene analysis using nuclear DNA by Jønsson and colleagues in 2012 clarified that the forest and little raven are each other's closest relative. The northern subspecies "boreus" turned out to be nested in the Tasmanian "tasmanicus", indicating the populations separated very recently. It is still recognised as a distinct subspecies by the <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Committee">International Ornithological Committee</a>.

Ian Rowley proposed that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north. The raven diverged into the ancestor of the forest and little ravens in the east and Australian raven in the west. As the climate was cooler and drier, the aridity of central Australia split them entirely as the habitat between became inhospitable. Furthermore, the eastern diverged into nomadic little ravens and, in forested refuges, forest ravens. As the climate eventually became warmer, the western ravens spread eastwards and outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia, as evidenced by the forest raven being only found in closed forest refuges on the mainland but in a wider variety of habitats in Tasmania.

The largest of the Australian corvids, the adult forest raven is in length with a wingspan between and weight of approximately . There is no seasonal variation in plumage, which is entirely glossy black with a blue or green sheen visible on the upperparts. The wings are long and broad, with the largest of its ten primary feathers (usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth) almost reaching the end of the tail when at rest. The tail is rounded or wedge-shaped. It is quite short in Tasmanian populations but longer in northern New South Wales. The beak is a similar shape to that of the little raven, though more massive and heavy-set. The upper mandible, including the nares and nasal groove, is covered with bristles. The mouth and tongue are black, as are the powerful legs and feet. The <a href="Tibiotarsus">tibia</a> is fully feathered and the <a href="Tarsometatarsus">tarsus</a> is long.

Sexes have identical plumage; the male is generally larger, but there is considerable overlap in size between individuals. The forest raven can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers, which is white in the latter species. The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows. Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field, but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled. The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species, with the forest raven the stockiest of all. Relative size is only useful when two species can be seen side by side, as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small. In Tasmania, the forest raven could be confused with the <a href="black%20currawong">black currawong</a>, though the latter species has more slender wings with white markings, a longer tail and a very different call.

Juveniles (birds up to a year old) have a shorter, shallower bill, which is dark grey with some pink at the base. The <a href="Beak%23Gape">gape</a> is pink. The plumage is softer and fluffier and often has a brown tint. It generally lacks the glossy sheen of adult birds, though a blue-purple sheen can be seen sometimes on mantle and shoulders plumage. Birds between one and two years old closely resemble adults but retain juvenile feathers on wings and tail and have smaller bills. Birds between two and three years have adult plumage but lack the adult eye colour. Eye colour varies with age: nestlings up to four months old have blue-grey eyes, juveniles aged from four to fourteen months have brown eyes, and immature birds have hazel eyes with blue eyerings around the pupil until age two years and ten months.

The <a href="Bird%20vocalization">call</a> is considered the most reliable means of identification in areas where the forest raven's range overlaps with other corvids. It is a deep and husky ""korr-korr-korr-korr"" with a similarly drawn out last note to the Australian raven. It can also utter a barking <a href="alarm%20call">alarm call</a>. The calls of juveniles have a higher pitch than those of adult birds. Mated pairs greet each other with a specific return-home call; a long extended descending call, and characteristic flapping flight with reduced-amplitude wingbeats.

The only member of the <a href="Corvidae">corvid</a> family that has a permanent population in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, the forest raven is the most widely distributed bird species in the state. There are three populations in southern Victoria: from the vicinity of <a href="Lakes%20Entrance%2C%20Victoria">Lakes Entrance</a> west across <a href="Gippsland">Gippsland</a> to <a href="Wilsons%20Promontory">Wilsons Promontory</a>, the <a href="Great%20Otway%20National%20Park">Otway Ranges</a> from west of <a href="Torquay%2C%20Victoria">Torquay</a> to <a href="Port%20Campbell">Port Campbell</a>, and lastly in the <a href="Grampians%20National%20Park">Grampians</a> and Millicent Plain extending into south-east South Australia. Isolated records suggest the latter two populations may actually be continuous. There are two disjunct populations in northern New South Wales. A coastal population is found from <a href="Tea%20Gardens%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tea Gardens</a> north to <a href="Yuraygir%20National%20Park">Yuraygir National Park</a>, while a more montane population is found along the <a href="Great%20Dividing%20Range">Great Dividing Range</a> and <a href="New%20England%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">New England Tableland</a> from <a href="Gloucester%20Tops">Gloucester Tops</a> in the south to <a href="Tenterfield%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tenterfield</a> in the north. The gap between the two populations is around , shrinking to at <a href="Dorrigo%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Dorrigo</a>.

The forest raven inhabits a wide range of habitat within Tasmania such as woods, open interrupted forest, mountains, coastal areas, farmland and town and city fringes. A survey of <a href="Mount%20Wellington%20%28Tasmania%29">Mount Wellington</a> found it to be one of the few birds that remained in open and marshland habitat at higher elevations over the winter. On mainland Australia it appears to be more confined to forests: wet and dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest and cool <a href="temperate%20rainforest">temperate rainforest</a>, as well as pine plantations in Victoria. Populations in Victoria and New South Wales are possibly expanding, with the species more evident in towns such as <a href="Forster%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Forster-Tuncurry</a> and <a href="Port%20Macquarie">Port Macquarie</a>, and along segments of the <a href="Oxley%20Highway">Oxley Highway</a> between <a href="Wauchope%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wauchope</a> and <a href="Walcha%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Walcha</a>, and <a href="Thunderbolts%20Way">Thunderbolts Way</a> between <a href="Gloucester%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Gloucester</a> and <a href="Nowendoc%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Nowendoc</a>, most likely due to roadkill from increased vehicular traffic. It is unclear whether records since the 1970s in areas where the forest raven was unknown are the result of range expansion or improved field observations and identification.

Forest ravens fly from Tasmania and the mainland to islands well offshore in <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a> and may even traverse the strait entirely. First recorded on <a href="King%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">King Island</a> in Bass Strait in 1979, the forest raven has become more numerous and flocks of several hundred birds were recorded by 1997. The island was previously inhabited by little ravens.

Its large range and abundance means the bird is classified as "Least Concern" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>; some decrease has been noted but it is of insufficient size or duration to change classification. The populations of northern New South Wales have been classified as "Near Threatened" in 2000 by Garnett and Crowley and were estimated at the time to number about 10,000 breeding pairs.

Sedentary and territorial, the forest raven is similar in breeding and feeding habits to the Australian raven. A single breeding pair and their brood occupy a territory of variable size—areas of have been recorded—and remains there year-round, though groups of ravens may enter this area to forage. In northern New South Wales, forest ravens have been recorded nesting near Australian ravens and <a href="Torresian%20crow">Torresian crow</a>s. They were observed warding off the Australian ravens but to a degree permitting the crows to pass through their territories. Forest ravens will defend their territory by chasing and <a href="Mobbing%20%28animal%20behavior%29">mobbing</a> intruding birds of prey as large as <a href="wedge-tailed%20eagle">wedge-tailed eagle</a>s and <a href="white-bellied%20sea%20eagle">white-bellied sea eagle</a>s. Agonistic displays to ward off potential intruders include flying to a high perch and calling loudly with head extended and hackles raised. Forest ravens will give their wings a flick on the upward wingbeat when flying to the perch and may continue flicking their wings after landing. Subadult and nonbreeding forest ravens form flocks that move around, though they may use the same roosting site for a few months at a time. Forest ravens generally walk when moving around on the ground, though do hop when hurrying, such as when trying to avoid an oncoming car on a road.

Forest ravens breed after at least three years, and form monogamous pairs. Birds breed later in Tasmania than mainland Australia, though the species has been little-studied. Eggs have been recorded from July to September and nestlings in September and October in New South Wales, while nestlings have been noted from September to December in Victoria. In Tasmania, the breeding season appears to take place from August to January. Forest ravens generally nest in forks in tall trees, usually eucalypts, below the canopy line. They have been recorded nesting on the ground on some Bass Strait Islands. Breeding success rates were impacted severely by droughts in New South Wales.

The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of twigs lined with available materials such as leaves, wool, grass, bark, feathers, or occasionally horse manure or hair from cattle. The sticks are generally thick. Nests are sometimes renovated from previous years. A clutch can comprise up to six eggs, though usually four or five are laid. Measuring 45 by 31 mm ( ×  in), eggs are green-cream and splotched with brown and grey markings. Eggs are laid every one to two days. Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified. <a href="Avian%20incubation">Incubation</a> of the eggs is done solely by the female. The chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a> and <a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a>; that is, they are born helpless, naked and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period. Both parents feed the young.

The forest raven is an <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>, though it eats more meat than smaller corvids. Its diet includes a wide range of foods such as insects, <a href="carrion">carrion</a>, fruit, grain and earthworms. It has been known to attack and eat birds as large as the <a href="little%20penguin">little penguin</a>, though many birds and mammals are already dead when encountered. In general, a significant proportion of its food appears to come from habitats in or near water. Forest ravens observed on the beach at Wilson's Promontory would glean the sand and turn over or disturb pieces of seaweed and debris for insect prey. They have also been reported taking crabs from sandbars and raiding seabird colonies for eggs and young.

Forest ravens forage in pairs or groups of up to ten birds, though they may gather in much larger numbers if there is an abundant food source, such as a large carcass, rubbish or insect swarm. The species is attracted to areas where people have discarded excess food, such as rubbish tips, picnic grounds, parks, gardens and roads. Forest ravens sometimes forage in <a href="mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species flocks</a> with Torresian crows, little and Australian ravens. In these situations, the more abundant species may exclude the less abundant. In Tasmania, forest ravens have been recorded foraging with <a href="Pacific%20gull">Pacific</a> and <a href="silver%20gull">silver gull</a>s, and black currawongs. Foraging takes place in the early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while walking along and looking, and turning over objects with their bills as they go. Forest ravens often fly above the ground over marshland, heath or beaches looking for food. Nests of various birds, including domestic chickens and burrowing seabirds have been raided for eggs and young. Forest ravens have been observed attempting to raid the nest of ospreys on the New South Wales north coast.

Forest ravens cache food items for later consumption, generally using trees to evade other scavengers. Field observations in Nambucca showed that they built stick-like platforms in diameter high in the canopies of trees as places to store and eat food. They were recorded storing food in tree forks above the ground and within the folds of the bark of paperbark trees. In another field study, a forest raven stole a cape barren goose egg and hid it in a grassy tussock to consume later.

Alongside Australian ravens, forest ravens have been blamed for damaging orchards and killing lambs and poultry. This is not supported by fieldwork. They most often scavenge for afterbirth and newborn lamb faeces, which are highly nutritious. They are thought to have a beneficial role in cleaning up carcasses and consuming insect pests. Forest ravens prey on the larvae of the pasture beetle "<a href="Scitala%20sericans">Scitala sericans</a>". The beetle can damage pastures and is an agricultural pest; the raven may uproot plants when digging out the grubs.

The mite "<a href="Knemidocoptes%20intermedius">Knemidocoptes intermedius</a>" has been isolated from the forest raven. Infestation results in crusty (hyperkeratotic) grey lesions around their tibiotarsal joints, the mites living in tunnels under the skin. The <a href="channel-billed%20cuckoo">channel-billed cuckoo</a> ("Scythrops novaehollandiae") has been recorded as a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>.

Like the Australian raven on mainland Australia, the Forest raven in Tasmania has a history of being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers as it is perceived to be a threat to livestock and orchard crops. It is not protected under Tasmania's Nature Conservation Act 2002 and no permit is required if landowners seek to kill them. Larger numbers of forest ravens (alongside swamp harriers and brown falcons) were killed in 1958 as rabbit populations dwindled due to myxomatosis and predatory birds were thought to have turned their attention to poultry and livestock. Studies on corvids elsewhere in Australia showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked, and hence their poor reputation was unjustified. Forest ravens may do more good than harm by preying on insects and removing carrion. Despite their fondness for roadkill, forest ravens are rarely hit by vehicles.

<doc id="212374" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212374" title="Nebular hypothesis">
Nebular hypothesis

The nebular hypothesis is the most widely accepted model in the field of <a href="cosmogony">cosmogony</a> to explain the <a href="formation%20and%20evolution%20of%20the%20Solar%20System">formation and evolution of the Solar System</a> (as well as other <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a>s). It suggests that the Solar System is formed from the nebulous material. The theory was developed by <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> and published in his "<a href="Allgemeine%20Naturgeschichte%20und%20Theorie%20des%20Himmels">Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels</a>" ("Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens"), published in 1755. Originally applied to the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, the process of planetary system formation is now thought to be at work throughout the <a href="Universe">Universe</a>. The widely accepted modern variant of the nebular hypothesis is the solar nebular disk model (SNDM) or solar nebular model. It offered explanations for a variety of properties of the Solar System, including the nearly circular and coplanar orbits of the planets, and their motion in the same direction as the Sun's rotation. Some elements of the original nebular hypothesis are echoed in modern theories of planetary formation, but most elements have been superseded.

According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form in massive and dense clouds of <a href="molecular%20hydrogen">molecular hydrogen</a>—<a href="giant%20molecular%20cloud">giant molecular cloud</a>s (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation is a complex process, which always produces a gaseous <a href="protoplanetary%20disk">protoplanetary disk</a>, <a href="proplyd">proplyd</a>, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems is thought to be a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1 million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next 10–100 million years.

The protoplanetary disk is an <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a> that feeds the central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools in what is known as the <a href="T%20Tauri%20star">T Tauri star</a> stage; here, formation of small <a href="dust">dust</a> grains made of <a href="rock%20%28geology%29">rocks</a> and ice is possible. The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000 years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized <a href="planetary%20embryo">planetary embryo</a>s. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a>s. The last stage takes approximately 100 million to a billion years.

The formation of <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a>s is a more complicated process. It is thought to occur beyond the <a href="Frost%20line%20%28astrophysics%29">frost line</a>, where planetary embryos mainly are made of various types of ice. As a result, they are several times more massive than in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk. What follows after the embryo formation is not completely clear. Some embryos appear to continue to grow and eventually reach 5–10 <a href="Earth%20mass">Earth mass</a>es—the threshold value, which is necessary to begin accretion of the <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>–<a href="helium">helium</a> gas from the disk. The accumulation of gas by the core is initially a slow process, which continues for several million years, but after the forming protoplanet reaches about 30 Earth masses () it accelerates and proceeds in a runaway manner. <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>- and <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>-like planets are thought to accumulate the bulk of their mass during only 10,000 years. The accretion stops when the gas is exhausted. The formed planets can migrate over long distances during or after their formation. <a href="Ice%20giant">Ice giant</a>s such as <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> are thought to be failed cores, which formed too late when the disk had almost disappeared.

There is evidence that <a href="Emanuel%20Swedenborg">Emanuel Swedenborg</a> first proposed parts of the nebular hypothesis in 1734. <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, familiar with Swedenborg's work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own "Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens", wherein he argued that gaseous clouds (<a href="nebulae">nebulae</a>) slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten due to <a href="gravity">gravity</a>, eventually forming <a href="star">star</a>s and <a href="planet">planet</a>s.

<a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a> independently developed and proposed a similar model in 1796 in his "Exposition du systeme du monde". He envisioned that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout the volume of the Solar System. His theory featured a contracting and cooling protosolar cloud—the protosolar nebula. As this cooled and contracted, it flattened and spun more rapidly, throwing off (or shedding) a series of gaseous rings of material; and according to him, the planets condensed from this material. His model was similar to Kant's, except more detailed and on a smaller scale. While the Laplacian nebular model dominated in the 19th century, it encountered a number of difficulties. The main problem involved <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a> distribution between the Sun and planets. The planets have 99% of the angular momentum, and this fact could not be explained by the nebular model. As a result, astronomers largely abandoned this theory of planet formation at the beginning of the 20th century.

A major critique came during the 19th century from <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> (1831-1879), who maintained that "different rotation between the inner and outer parts of a ring" could not allow condensation of material. Astronomer <a href="Sir%20David%20Brewster">Sir David Brewster</a> also rejected Laplace, writing in 1876 that "those who believe in the Nebular Theory consider it as certain that our Earth derived its solid matter and its atmosphere from a ring thrown from the Solar atmosphere, which afterwards contracted into a solid terraqueous sphere, from which the Moon was thrown off by the same process". He argued that under such view, "the Moon must necessarily have carried off water and air from the watery and aerial parts of the Earth and must have an atmosphere". Brewster claimed that <a href="Sir%20Isaac%20Newton">Sir Isaac Newton</a>'s religious beliefs had previously considered nebular ideas as tending to atheism, and quoted him as saying that "the growth of new systems out of old ones, without the mediation of a Divine power, seemed to him apparently absurd".

The perceived deficiencies of the Laplacian model stimulated scientists to find a replacement for it. During the 20th century many theories addressed the issue, including the "planetesimal theory" of <a href="Thomas%20Chrowder%20Chamberlin">Thomas Chamberlin</a> and <a href="Forest%20Ray%20Moulton">Forest Moulton</a> (1901), the "tidal model" of <a href="James%20Jeans">James Jeans</a> (1917), the "accretion model" of <a href="Otto%20Schmidt">Otto Schmidt</a> (1944), the "protoplanet theory" of <a href="William%20McCrea%20%28astronomer%29">William McCrea</a> (1960) and finally the "capture theory" of <a href="Michael%20Woolfson">Michael Woolfson</a>. In 1978 <a href="Andrew%20Prentice">Andrew Prentice</a> resurrected the initial Laplacian ideas about planet formation and developed the "modern Laplacian theory". None of these attempts proved completely successful, and many of the proposed theories were descriptive.

The birth of the modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation—the solar nebular disk model (SNDM)—can be traced to the Soviet astronomer <a href="Victor%20Safronov">Victor Safronov</a>. His 1969 book "Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets", which was translated to English in 1972, had a long-lasting effect on the way scientists think about the formation of the planets. In this book almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved. Safronov's ideas were further developed in the works of <a href="George%20Wetherill">George Wetherill</a>, who discovered "<a href="Accretion%20%28astrophysics%29%23Runaway%20accretion">runaway accretion</a>". While originally applied only to the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, the SNDM was subsequently thought by theorists to be at work throughout the Universe; as of astronomers have discovered <a href="extrasolar%20planet">extrasolar planet</a>s in our <a href="galaxy">galaxy</a>.

The star formation process naturally results in the appearance of <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a>s around young stellar objects. At the age of about 1 million years, 100% of stars may have such disks. This conclusion is supported by the discovery of the gaseous and dusty disks around <a href="protostar">protostar</a>s and <a href="T%20Tauri%20star">T Tauri star</a>s as well as by theoretical considerations. Observations of these disks show that the <a href="dust">dust</a> grains inside them grow in size on short (thousand-year) time scales, producing 1 centimeter sized particles.

The accretion process, by which 1 km <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s grow into 1,000 km sized bodies, is well understood now. This process develops inside any disk where the number density of planetesimals is sufficiently high, and proceeds in a runaway manner. Growth later slows and continues as oligarchic accretion. The end result is formation of <a href="planetary%20embryo">planetary embryo</a>s of varying sizes, which depend on the distance from the star. Various simulations have demonstrated that the merger of embryos in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk leads to the formation of a few Earth-sized bodies. Thus the origin of <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a>s is now considered to be an almost solved problem.

The physics of accretion disks encounters some problems. The most important one is how the material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a>. One possible explanation suggested by <a href="Hannes%20Alfv%C3%A9n">Hannes Alfvén</a> was that angular momentum was shed by the solar wind during its <a href="T%20Tauri%20star">T Tauri star</a> phase. The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding angular momentum is <a href="magnetic%20braking">magnetic braking</a>, where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field. The main processes responsible for the disappearance of the gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.

The formation of planetesimals is the biggest unsolved problem in the nebular disk model. How 1 cm sized particles coalesce into 1 km planetesimals is a mystery. This mechanism appears to be the key to the question as to why some stars have planets, while others have nothing around them, not even <a href="debris%20disk">dust belts</a>.

The formation timescale of <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a>s is also an important problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk. The mean lifetime of the disks, which is less than ten million (10) years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation. Much progress has been done to solve this problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> (or more massive planets) in about 4 million years or less, well within the average lifetime of gaseous disks.

Another potential problem of giant planet formation is their <a href="Planetary%20migration">orbital migration</a>. Some calculations show that interaction with the disk can cause rapid inward migration, which, if not stopped, results in the planet reaching the "central regions still as a sub-<a href="Jupiter%20mass">Jovian</a> object." More recent calculations indicate that disk evolution during migration can mitigate this problem.

<a href="Star">Star</a>s are thought to form inside <a href="molecular%20cloud">giant clouds</a> of cold <a href="molecular%20hydrogen">molecular hydrogen</a>—<a href="giant%20molecular%20cloud">giant molecular cloud</a>s roughly 300,000 times the mass of the Sun () and 20 <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s in diameter. Over millions of years, giant molecular clouds are prone to <a href="gravitational%20collapse">collapse</a> and fragmentation. These fragments then form small, dense cores, which in turn collapse into stars. The cores range in mass from a fraction to several times that of the Sun and are called protostellar (protosolar) nebulae. They possess diameters of 0.01–0.1 pc (2,000–20,000 AU) and a <a href="particle%20number%20density">particle number density</a> of roughly 10,000 to 100,000 cm.

The initial collapse of a solar-mass protostellar nebula takes around 100,000 years. Every nebula begins with a certain amount of <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a>. Gas in the central part of the nebula, with relatively low angular momentum, undergoes fast compression and forms a hot <a href="hydrostatic">hydrostatic</a> (not contracting) core containing a small fraction of the mass of the original nebula. This core forms the seed of what will become a star. As the collapse continues, conservation of angular momentum means that the rotation of the infalling envelope accelerates, which largely prevents the gas from directly <a href="accretion%20%28astrophysics%29">accreting</a> onto the central core. The gas is instead forced to spread outwards near its equatorial plane, forming a <a href="accretion%20disk">disk</a>, which in turn accretes onto the core. The core gradually grows in mass until it becomes a young hot <a href="protostar">protostar</a>. At this stage, the protostar and its disk are heavily obscured by the infalling envelope and are not directly observable. In fact the remaining envelope's <a href="opacity%20%28optics%29">opacity</a> is so high that even <a href="millimeter-wave">millimeter-wave</a> radiation has trouble escaping from inside it. Such objects are observed as very bright condensations, which emit mainly millimeter-wave and <a href="Terahertz%20radiation">submillimeter-wave</a> radiation. They are classified as spectral Class 0 protostars. The collapse is often accompanied by <a href="bipolar%20outflow">bipolar outflow</a>s—<a href="jet%20%28gas%29">jets</a>—that emanate along the <a href="rotation">rotation</a>al axis of the inferred disk. The jets are frequently observed in star-forming regions (see <a href="Herbig%E2%80%93Haro%20object">Herbig–Haro (HH) objects</a>). The luminosity of the Class 0 protostars is high — a solar-mass protostar may radiate at up to 100 solar luminosities. The source of this energy is <a href="gravitational%20collapse">gravitational collapse</a>, as their cores are not yet hot enough to begin <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a>.
As the infall of its material onto the disk continues, the envelope eventually becomes thin and transparent and the <a href="young%20stellar%20object">young stellar object</a> (YSO) becomes observable, initially in <a href="far-infrared">far-infrared</a> light and later in the visible. Around this time the protostar begins to <a href="nuclear%20fusion">fuse</a> <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a>. If the protostar is sufficiently massive (above 80 Jupiter masses ()), hydrogen fusion follows. Otherwise, if its mass is too low, the object becomes a <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a>. This birth of a new star occurs approximately 100,000 years after the collapse begins. Objects at this stage are known as Class I protostars, which are also called young <a href="T%20Tauri%20star">T Tauri star</a>s, evolved protostars, or young stellar objects. By this time the forming star has already accreted much of its mass: the total mass of the disk and remaining envelope does not exceed 10–20% of the mass of the central YSO.

At the next stage the envelope completely disappears, having been gathered up by the disk, and the protostar becomes a classical T Tauri star. This happens after about 1 million years. The mass of the disk around a classical T Tauri star is about 1–3% of the stellar mass, and it is accreted at a rate of 10 to per year. A pair of bipolar jets is usually present as well. The accretion explains all peculiar properties of classical T Tauri stars: strong <a href="flux">flux</a> in the <a href="emission%20line">emission line</a>s (up to 100% of the intrinsic <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> of the star), <a href="magnetic">magnetic</a> activity, <a href="photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometric</a> <a href="variable%20star">variability</a> and jets. The emission lines actually form as the accreted gas hits the "surface" of the star, which happens around its <a href="Poles%20of%20astronomical%20bodies%23Magnetic%20poles">magnetic poles</a>. The jets are byproducts of accretion: they carry away excessive angular momentum. The classical T Tauri stage lasts about 10 million years. The disk eventually disappears due to accretion onto the central star, planet formation, ejection by jets and <a href="photoevaporation">photoevaporation</a> by UV-radiation from the central star and nearby stars. As a result, the young star becomes a <a href="Weak-lined%20T%20Tauri%20star">weakly lined T Tauri star</a>, which slowly, over hundreds of millions of years, evolves into an ordinary Sun-like star.

Under certain circumstances the disk, which can now be called protoplanetary, may give birth to a <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a>. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around a very high fraction of stars in young <a href="star%20clusters">star clusters</a>. They exist from the beginning of a star's formation, but at the earliest stages are unobservable due to the <a href="Opacity%20%28optics%29">opacity</a> of the surrounding envelope. The disk of a Class 0 <a href="protostar">protostar</a> is thought to be massive and hot. It is an <a href="accretion%20%28astrophysics%29">accretion disk</a>, which feeds the central protostar. The temperature can easily exceed 400 <a href="Kelvin">K</a> inside 5 AU and 1,000 K inside 1 AU. The heating of the disk is primarily caused by the <a href="viscosity">viscous</a> <a href="dissipation">dissipation</a> of <a href="turbulence">turbulence</a> in it and by the infall of the gas from the nebula. The high <a href="temperature">temperature</a> in the inner disk causes most of the <a href="volatiles">volatile</a> material—water, organics, and some <a href="rock%20%28geology%29">rocks</a> to evaporate, leaving only the most <a href="refractory">refractory</a> elements like <a href="iron">iron</a>. The ice can survive only in the outer part of the disk.

The main problem in the physics of accretion disks is the generation of turbulence and the mechanism responsible for the high <a href="viscosity">effective viscosity</a>. The turbulent viscosity is thought to be responsible for the <a href="transport%20phenomena">transport</a> of the mass to the central protostar and momentum to the periphery of the disk. This is vital for accretion, because the gas can be accreted by the central protostar only if it loses most of its angular momentum, which must be carried away by the small part of the gas drifting outwards. The result of this process is the growth of both the protostar and of the disk <a href="radius">radius</a>, which can reach 1,000 AU if the initial angular momentum of the nebula is large enough. Large disks are routinely observed in many star-forming regions such as the <a href="Orion%20nebula">Orion nebula</a>.

The lifespan of the accretion disks is about 10 million years. By the time the star reaches the classical T-Tauri stage, the disk becomes thinner and cools. Less volatile materials start to <a href="condensation">condense</a> close to its center, forming 0.1–1 μm dust grains that contain <a href="crystalline">crystalline</a> <a href="silicate">silicate</a>s. The transport of the material from the outer disk can mix these newly formed <a href="cosmic%20dust">dust grains</a> with <a href="primordial%20elements">primordial</a> ones, which contain organic matter and other volatiles. This mixing can explain some peculiarities in the composition of Solar System bodies such as the presence of <a href="interstellar%20dust">interstellar</a> grains in the primitive <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s and refractory inclusions in comets.

Dust particles tend to stick to each other in the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and <a href="coagulation">coagulation</a> are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s measuring 1 km across or larger, which are the building blocks of <a href="planet">planet</a>s. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.

One hypothesis is formation by the <a href="Jeans%20instability">gravitational instability</a>. Particles several centimeters in size or larger slowly settle near the middle plane of the disk, forming a very thin—less than 100 km—and dense layer. This layer is gravitationally unstable and may fragment into numerous clumps, which in turn collapse into planetesimals. However, the differing velocities of the gas disk and the solids near the mid-plane can generate turbulence which prevents the layer from becoming thin enough to fragment due to gravitational instability. This may limit the formation of planetesimals via gravitational instabilities to specific locations in the disk where the concentration of solids is enhanced.

Another possible mechanism for the formation of planetesimals is the <a href="streaming%20instability">streaming instability</a> in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.

Planetary formation can also be triggered by gravitational instability within the disk itself, which leads to its fragmentation into clumps. Some of them, if they are dense enough, will <a href="gravitational%20collapse">collapse</a>, which can lead to rapid formation of <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a> planets and even <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a>s on the timescale of 1,000 years. If these clumps migrate inward as the collapse proceeds tidal forces from the star can result in a significant <a href="tidal%20downsizing">mass loss</a> leaving behind a smaller body. However it is only possible in massive disks—more massive than . In comparison, typical disk masses are . Because the massive disks are rare, this mechanism of the planet formation is thought to be infrequent. On the other hand, this mechanism may play a major role in the formation of <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a>s.

The ultimate <a href="dissipation">dissipation</a> of protoplanetary disks is triggered by a number of different mechanisms. The inner part of the disk is either accreted by the star or ejected by the <a href="bipolar%20outflow">bipolar jets</a>, whereas the outer part can <a href="photoevaporation">evaporate</a> under the star's powerful <a href="ultraviolet">UV</a> <a href="radiation">radiation</a> during the T Tauri stage or by nearby stars. The gas in the central part can either be accreted or ejected by the growing planets, while the small dust particles are ejected by the <a href="radiation%20pressure">radiation pressure</a> of the central star. What is finally left is either a planetary system, a remnant disk of dust without planets, or nothing, if planetesimals failed to form.

Because planetesimals are so numerous, and spread throughout the protoplanetary disk, some survive the formation of a planetary system. <a href="Asteroid">Asteroid</a>s are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide a great deal of information about the formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal <a href="Planetary%20differentiation">differentiation</a> took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.

According to the solar nebular disk model, <a href="rocky%20planet">rocky planet</a>s form in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within the <a href="frost%20line%20%28astrophysics%29">frost line</a>, where the temperature is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains. This results in coagulation of purely rocky grains and later in the formation of rocky planetesimals. Such conditions are thought to exist in the inner 3–4 AU part of the disk of a Sun-like star.

After small planetesimals—about 1 km in diameter—have formed by one way or another, "runaway accretion" begins. It is called runaway because the mass growth rate is proportional to , where R and M are the radius and mass of the growing body, respectively. The specific (divided by mass) growth accelerates as the mass increases. This leads to the preferential growth of larger bodies at the expense of smaller ones. The runaway accretion lasts between 10,000 and 100,000 years and ends when the largest bodies exceed approximately 1,000 km in diameter. Slowing of the accretion is caused by gravitational perturbations by large bodies on the remaining planetesimals. In addition, the influence of larger bodies stops further growth of smaller bodies.

The next stage is called "oligarchic accretion". It is characterized by the dominance of several hundred of the largest bodies—oligarchs, which continue to slowly accrete planetesimals. No body other than the oligarchs can grow. At this stage the rate of accretion is proportional to R, which is derived from the geometrical <a href="Cross%20section%20%28geometry%29">cross-section</a> of an oligarch. The specific accretion rate is proportional to ; and it declines with the mass of the body. This allows smaller oligarchs to catch up to larger ones. The oligarchs are kept at the distance of about (= is the <a href="Hill%20radius">Hill radius</a>, where a is the <a href="semimajor%20axis">semimajor axis</a>, e is the <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a>, and M is the mass of the central star) from each other by the influence of the remaining planetesimals. Their orbital eccentricities and inclinations remain small. The oligarchs continue to accrete until planetesimals are exhausted in the disk around them. Sometimes nearby oligarchs merge. The final mass of an oligarch depends on the distance from the star and surface density of planetesimals and is called the isolation mass. For the rocky planets it is up to , or one <a href="Mars">Mars</a> mass. The final result of the oligarchic stage is the formation of about 100 <a href="Moon">Moon</a>- to Mars-sized planetary embryos uniformly spaced at about . They are thought to reside inside gaps in the disk and to be separated by rings of remaining planetesimals. This stage is thought to last a few hundred thousand years.

The last stage of rocky planet formation is the "merger stage". It begins when only a small number of planetesimals remains and embryos become massive enough to perturb each other, which causes their orbits to become <a href="Chaos%20theory">chaotic</a>. During this stage embryos expel remaining planetesimals, and collide with each other. The result of this process, which lasts for 10 to 100 million years, is the formation of a limited number of Earth-sized bodies. Simulations show that the number of surviving planets is on average from 2 to 5. In the Solar System they may be represented by Earth and <a href="Venus">Venus</a>. Formation of both planets required merging of approximately 10–20 embryos, while an equal number of them were thrown out of the Solar System. Some of the embryos, which originated in the <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a>, are thought to have brought water to Earth. Mars and <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a> may be regarded as remaining embryos that survived that rivalry. Rocky planets, which have managed to coalesce, settle eventually into more or less stable orbits, explaining why planetary systems are generally packed to the limit; or, in other words, why they always appear to be at the brink of instability.

The formation of <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a>s is an outstanding problem in the <a href="planetary%20science">planetary science</a>s. In the framework of the solar nebular model two theories for their formation exist. The first one is the "disk instability model", where giant planets form in the massive protoplanetary disks as a result of its <a href="gravity">gravitational</a> fragmentation (see above). The second possibility is the "core accretion model", which is also known as the "nucleated instability model". The latter scenario is thought to be the most promising one, because it can explain the formation of the giant planets in relatively low-mass disks (less than ). In this model giant planet formation is divided into two stages: a) accretion of a core of approximately and b) accretion of gas from the protoplanetary disk. Either method may also lead to the creation of <a href="brown%20dwarfs">brown dwarfs</a>. Searches as of 2011 have found that core accretion is likely the dominant formation mechanism.

Giant planet core formation is thought to proceed roughly along the lines of the terrestrial planet formation. It starts with planetesimals that undergo runaway growth, followed by the slower oligarchic stage. Hypotheses do not predict a merger stage, due to the low probability of collisions between planetary embryos in the outer part of planetary systems. An additional difference is the composition of the <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s, which in the case of giant planets form beyond the so-called <a href="Frost%20line%20%28astrophysics%29">frost line</a> and consist mainly of ice—the ice to rock ratio is about 4 to 1. This enhances the mass of planetesimals fourfold. However, the minimum mass nebula capable of terrestrial planet formation can only form cores at the distance of Jupiter (5 AU) within 10 million years. The latter number represents the average lifetime of gaseous disks around Sun-like stars. The proposed solutions include enhanced mass of the disk—a tenfold increase would suffice; protoplanet migration, which allows the embryo to accrete more planetesimals; and finally accretion enhancement due to <a href="drag%20%28physics%29">gas drag</a> in the gaseous envelopes of the embryos. Some combination of the above-mentioned ideas may explain the formation of the cores of gas giant planets such as <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and perhaps even <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>. The formation of planets like <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> is more problematic, since no theory has been capable of providing for the in situ formation of their cores at the distance of 20–30 AU from the central star. One hypothesis is that they initially accreted in the Jupiter-Saturn region, then were scattered and migrated to their present location. Another possible solution is the growth of the cores of the giant planets via <a href="pebble%20accretion">pebble accretion</a>. In pebble accretion objects between a cm and a meter in diameter falling toward a massive body are slowed enough by gas drag for them to spiral toward it and be accreted. Growth via pebble accretion may be as much as 1000 times faster than by the accretion of planetesimals.

Once the cores are of sufficient mass (), they begin to gather gas from the surrounding disk. Initially it is a slow process, increasing the core masses up to in a few million years. After that, the accretion rates increase dramatically and the remaining 90% of the mass is accumulated in approximately 10,000 years. The accretion of gas stops when the supply from the disk is exhausted. This happens gradually, due to the formation of a density gap in the protoplanetary disk and to disk dispersal. In this model ice giants—Uranus and Neptune—are failed cores that began gas accretion too late, when almost all gas had already disappeared. The post-runaway-gas-accretion stage is characterized by migration of the newly formed giant planets and continued slow gas accretion. Migration is caused by the interaction of the planet sitting in the gap with the remaining disk. It stops when the protoplanetary disk disappears or when the end of the disk is attained. The latter case corresponds to the so-called <a href="hot%20Jupiters">hot Jupiters</a>, which are likely to have stopped their migration when they reached the inner hole in the protoplanetary disk.

Giant planets can significantly influence <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a> formation. The presence of giants tends to increase <a href="Orbital%20eccentricity">eccentricities</a> and <a href="orbital%20inclination">inclinations</a> (see <a href="Kozai%20mechanism">Kozai mechanism</a>) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4 AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form near the end of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.

The region of a planetary system adjacent to the giant planets will be influenced in a different way. In such a region, eccentricities of embryos may become so large that the embryos pass close to a giant planet, which may cause them to be ejected from the system. If all embryos are removed, then no planets will form in this region. An additional consequence is that a huge number of small planetesimals will remain, because giant planets are incapable of clearing them all out without the help of embryos. The total mass of remaining planetesimals will be small, because cumulative action of the embryos before their ejection and giant planets is still strong enough to remove 99% of the small bodies. Such a region will eventually evolve into an <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a>, which is a full analog of the asteroid belt in the Solar System, located from 2 to 4 AU from the Sun.

Thousands of exoplanets have been identified in the last twenty years. The orbits of many of these planets and systems of planets differ significantly from the planets in the Solar System. The exoplanets discovered include hot-Jupiters, warm-Jupiters, super-Earths, and systems of tightly packed inner planets.

The hot-Jupiters and warm-Jupiters are thought to have migrated to their current orbits during or following their formation. A number of possible mechanisms for this migration have been proposed. Type I or Type II migration could smoothly decrease the semimajor axis of the planet's orbit resulting in a warm- or hot-Jupiter. Gravitational scattering by other planets onto eccentric orbits with a perihelion near the star followed by the circularization of its orbit due to tidal interactions with the star can leave a planet on a close orbit. If a massive companion planet or star on an inclined orbit was present an exchange of inclination for eccentricity via the Kozai mechanism raising eccentricities and lowering perihelion followed by circularization can also result in a close orbit. Many of the Jupiter-sized planets have eccentric orbits which may indicate that gravitational encounters occurred between the planets, although migration while in resonance can also excite eccentricities. The in situ growth of hot Jupiters from closely orbiting super Earths has also been proposed. The cores in this hypothesis could have formed locally or at a greater distance and migrated close to the star.

Super-Earths and other closely orbiting planets are thought to have either formed in situ or to have migrated inward from their initial locations. The in situ formation of closely orbiting super-Earths would require a massive disk, the migration of planetary embryos followed by collisions and mergers, or the radial drift of small solids from farther out in the disk. The migration of the super-Earths, or the embryos that collided to form them, is likely to have been Type I due to their smaller mass. The resonant orbits of some of the exoplanet systems indicates that some migration occurred in these systems, while the spacing of the orbits in many of the other systems not in resonance indicates that an instability likely occurred in those systems after the dissipation of the gas disk. The absence of Super-Earths and closely orbiting planets in the Solar System may be due to the previous formation of Jupiter blocking their inward migration.

The amount of gas a super-Earth that formed in situ acquires may depend on when the planetary embryos merged due to giant impacts relative to the dissipation of the gas disk. If the mergers happen after the gas disk dissipates terrestrial planets can form, if in a transition disk a super-Earth with a gas envelope containing a few percent of its mass may form. If the mergers happen too early runaway gas accretion may occur leading to the formation of a gas giant. The mergers begin when the dynamical friction due to the gas disk becomes insufficient to prevent collisions, a process that will begin earlier in a higher metallicity disk. Alternatively gas accretion may be limited due to the envelopes not being in hydrostatic equilibrium, instead gas may flow through the envelope slowing its growth and delaying the onset of runaway gas accretion until the mass of the core reaches 15 Earth masses.

Use of the term "<a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a>" for the <a href="protoplanetary%20disk">protoplanetary disk</a> leads to confusion over the <a href="planetary%20accretion">planetary accretion</a> process.
The protoplanetary disk is sometimes referred to as an accretion disk, because while the young <a href="T%20Tauri%20star">T Tauri</a>-like protostar is still contracting, gaseous material may still be falling onto it, accreting on its surface from the disk's inner edge. In an accretion disk, there is a net flux of mass from larger radii toward smaller radii.

However, that meaning should not be confused with the process of accretion forming the planets. In this context, accretion refers to the process of cooled, solidified grains of dust and ice orbiting the <a href="protostar">protostar</a> in the protoplanetary disk, colliding and sticking together and gradually growing, up to and including the high-energy collisions between sizable <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s.

In addition, the <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a>s probably had accretion disks of their own, in the first meaning of the word. The clouds of captured hydrogen and helium gas contracted, spun up, flattened, and deposited gas onto the surface of each giant <a href="protoplanet">protoplanet</a>, while solid bodies within that disk accreted into the giant planet's regular moons.

Four <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised, which mainly differ in the colouration of the <a href="plumage">plumage</a> on the head and nape. <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> first <a href="Species%20description">described</a> it formally, giving it the name "Corvus monedula". The common name derives from the word "jack", denoting "small", and daw, a less common <a href="synonym">synonym</a> for "jackdaw", and the native English name for the bird.

Measuring in length, the western jackdaw is a black-plumaged bird with a grey <a href="nape">nape</a> and distinctive pale-grey <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a>. It is <a href="gregarious">gregarious</a> and vocal, living in small groups with a complex social structure in farmland, open woodland, on coastal cliffs, and in urban settings. Like its relatives, Jackdaws are intelligent birds, and have been observed using tools. An <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a> and opportunistic feeder, it eats a wide variety of plant material and <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, as well as food waste from urban areas. Western jackdaws are <a href="Monogamous%20pairing%20in%20animals">monogamous</a> and build simple nests of sticks in cavities in trees, cliffs, or buildings. About five pale blue or blue-green eggs with brown speckles are laid and incubated by the female. The young fledge in four to five weeks.

The western jackdaw was one of the many species originally described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his 18th century work "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>". Owing to its supposed fondness for picking up coins, Linnaeus gave it the binomial name "Corvus monedula", choosing the <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "mǒnēdŭla", which is derived from "<a href="moneta">moneta</a>", the Latin stem of the word "money". Jackdaws are sometimes placed in the genus "<a href="Coloeus">Coloeus</a>", from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> κολοιός ("koloios") for jackdaw, though most subsequent works have retained the two jackdaw species in "Corvus".

The original <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word "ċēo" (pronounced with initial "ch") gave modern English "<a href="chough">chough</a>"; <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Chaucer</a> sometimes used this word to refer to the western jackdaw, as did <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> in "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>" although there has been debate about which species he was referring to. This <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a> name, based on the western jackdaw's call, now refers to corvids of the genus "<a href="Pyrrhocorax">Pyrrhocorax</a>"; the <a href="red-billed%20chough">red-billed chough</a> ("Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax"), formerly particularly common in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, became known initially as the "Cornish chough" and then just the "chough", the name transferring from one species to the other.

The common name "jackdaw" first appeared in the 16th century, and is thought to be a compound of the forename "Jack", used in animal names to signify a small form (e.g. <a href="jack%20snipe">jack snipe</a>), and the archaic native English word "daw". Formerly, western jackdaws were simply called "daws". The metallic "chyak" call may be the origin of the "jack" part of the common name, but this is not supported by the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>". "Daw", first used for the bird in the 15th century, is held by the "Oxford English Dictionary" to be derived from the postulated <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "dawe", citing the <a href="cognate">cognate</a>s in <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> "tāha", <a href="Middle%20High%20German">Middle High German</a> "tāhe" or "tāchele", and modern German "Dahle" or "Dohle", and dialectal "Tach, Dähi, Däche" and "Dacha".

Names in English dialects are numerous. Scottish and north English dialects have included "ka" or "kae" since the 14th century. The <a href="Midlands%20%28England%29">Midlands</a> form of this word was "co" or "coo". "Caddow" is potentially a compound of "ka" and "dow", a variant of "daw". Other dialectal or obsolete names include "caddesse", "cawdaw", "caddy", "chauk", "college-bird", "jackerdaw", "jacko", "ka-wattie", "chimney-sweep bird" (from their nesting propensities), and "sea-crow" (from the frequency with which they are found on coasts). It was also frequently known quasi-nominally as "Jack".

An archaic <a href="collective%20noun">collective noun</a> for a group of jackdaws is a "clattering". Another name for a flock is a "train".

A study in 2000 found that the genetic distance between jackdaws and the other members of "Corvus" was greater than that within the rest of the genus. This led <a href="Pamela%20C.%20Rasmussen">Pamela Rasmussen</a> to reinstate the genus name "Coloeus", created by <a href="Johann%20Jakob%20Kaup">Johann Kaup</a> in 1829, in her "<a href="Birds%20of%20South%20Asia">Birds of South Asia</a>" (2005), a treatment also used in a 1982 systematic list in German by <a href="Hans%20Edmund%20Wolters">Hans Edmund Wolters</a>. A study of corvid <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> undertaken in 2007 compared DNA sequences in the <a href="mtDNA%20control%20region">mitochondrial control region</a> of several corvids. It found that the western jackdaw, and the closely related <a href="Daurian%20jackdaw">Daurian jackdaw</a> ("C. dauuricus") of eastern <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="China">China</a>, were <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> to the core "Corvus" <a href="clade">clade</a>. The names "Coloeus monedula" and "Coloeus dauuricus" have since been adopted by the <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Congress">International Ornithological Congress</a> in their official list. The two species of jackdaw have been reported to <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridise</a> in the <a href="Altai%20Mountains">Altai Mountains</a>, southern <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, and <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>. Analysis of the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> of specimens of the two species from their core ranges show them to be genetically distinct.

There are four recognised subspecies of the western jackdaw. All European subspecies <a href="intergrade">intergrade</a> where their populations meet. "C. m. monedula" intergrades into "C. m. soemmerringii" in a transition zone running from <a href="Finland">Finland</a> south across the <a href="Baltic%20region">Baltic</a> and eastern <a href="Poland">Poland</a> to <a href="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>.


Measuring in length, the western jackdaw is the second smallest member of the genus "Corvus". Most of the plumage is a shiny black, with a purple (in subspecies "monedula" and "spermologus") or blue (in subspecies "cirtensis" and "soemmerringii") sheen on the crown, forehead, and <a href="Flight%20feather%23Secondaries">secondaries</a>, and a green-blue sheen on the throat, <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">primaries</a>, and tail. The cheeks, nape and neck are light grey to greyish-silver, and the underparts are slate-grey. The legs are black, as is the short stout bill, the length of which is about 75% of the length of the rest of the head. There are <a href="Beak%23Rictal%20bristles">rictal bristles</a> covering around 40% of the maxilla and 25% of the lower mandible. The <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a> of adults are greyish or silvery white while those of juveniles are light blue, becoming brownish before whitening at around one year of age. The sexes look alike, though the head and neck plumage of male birds fades more with age and wear, particularly just before <a href="Moulting%23Birds">moulting</a>. Western jackdaws undergo a complete <a href="Moulting">moult</a> from June to September in the western parts of their range, and a month later in the east. The purplish sheen of the cap is most prominent just after moulting.

Immature birds have duller and less demarcated plumage. The head is a sooty black, sometimes with a faint greenish sheen and brown feather bases visible; the back and side of the neck are dark grey and the underparts greyish or sooty black. The tail has narrower feathers and a greenish sheen.

There is very little geographic variation in size. The main differences are the presence or absence of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in the shade of the nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.

A skilled flyer, the western jackdaw can manoeuvre tightly as well as tumble and glide. It has characteristic jerky wing beats when flying, though these are not evident when birds are <a href="bird%20migration">migrating</a>. <a href="Wind%20tunnel">Wind tunnel</a> experiments show that the preferred gliding speed is between per second and that the wingspan decreases as the bird flies faster. On the ground, western jackdaws have an upright posture and strut briskly, their short legs giving them a rapid gait. They feed with their heads held down or horizontally.

Within its range, the western jackdaw is unmistakable; its short bill and grey nape are distinguishing features. From a distance, it can be confused with a <a href="Rook%20%28bird%29">rook</a> ("Corvus frugilegus"), or when in flight, with a <a href="Columbidae">pigeon</a> or <a href="chough">chough</a>. Flying western jackdaws are distinguishable from other corvids by their smaller size, faster and deeper wingbeats and proportionately narrower and less fingered wing tips. They also have shorter, thicker necks, much shorter bills and frequently fly in tighter flocks. They can be distinguished from choughs by their uniformly grey underwings and their black beaks and legs. The western jackdaw is very similar in morphology, behaviour, and calls to the Daurian jackdaw, with which its range overlaps in western Asia. Adults are readily distinguished, since the Daurian has a pied plumage, but immature birds are much more similar, both species having dark plumage and dark eyes. The Daurian tends to be darker, with a less contrasting nape than the Western.

Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, frequently given in flight, is a metallic and squeaky "chyak-chyak" or "kak-kak". This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as "kiaw" or "kyow". Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as "kyaay", "tchaayk" or "giaaaa". Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws also have a hoarse, drawn-out <a href="alarm%20call">alarm call</a>, "arrrrr" or "kaaaarr", used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft "cheep" at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.

The western jackdaw is found from north-west Africa through all of Europe, except for the extreme north, and eastwards through <a href="central%20Asia">central Asia</a> to the eastern <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> and <a href="Lake%20Baikal">Lake Baikal</a>. To the east, it occurs throughout <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and north-west <a href="India">India</a>. However, it is regionally extinct in <a href="Malta">Malta</a> and <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>. The range is vast, with an estimated global extent of between 1 million and 10 million square kilometres (4 hundred thousand to 4 million square miles). It has a large global population, with an estimated 15.6 to 45 million individuals in Europe alone. Censuses of bird populations in marginal uplands in Britain show that western jackdaws greatly increased in numbers between the 1970s and 2010, although this increase may be related to recovery from previous periods when they were regarded as pests. The UK population was estimated at 2.5 million individuals in 1998, up from 780,000 in 1970.
Most populations are resident, but the northern and eastern populations are more migratory, relocating to wintering areas between September and November and returning between February and early May. Their range expands northwards into Russia to Siberia during summer, and retracts in winter. They are vagrants to the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, particularly in the winter and spring, and occasionally to <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>. Elsewhere, western jackdaws congregate over winter in the <a href="Ural%20River">Ural Valley</a> in north-western Kazakhstan, the north <a href="Caspian%20Depression">Caspian</a>, and the <a href="Tian%20Shan">Tian Shan</a> region of western China. They are winter visitors to the <a href="Quetta">Quetta Valley</a> in western Pakistan, and are winter vagrants to <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, where they were first recorded in 1962. In <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, they are winter vagrants and rare residents with some confirmed breeding taking place. The "soemmerringii" subspecies occurs in south-central Siberia and extreme north-west China and is accidental to <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. A small number of western jackdaws reached the north-east of North America in the 1980s and have been found from <a href="Atlantic%20Canada">Atlantic Canada</a> to <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. They have also occurred as vagrants in <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>, and <a href="Saint%20Pierre%20and%20Miquelon">Saint Pierre and Miquelon</a>, and one is reported to have been seen in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>.

Western jackdaws inhabit wooded <a href="steppe">steppe</a>s, pastures, cultivated land, coastal cliffs, and towns. They thrive when forested areas are cleared and converted to fields and open areas. Habitats with a mix of large trees, buildings, and open ground are preferred; open fields are left to the rook, and more wooded areas to the <a href="Eurasian%20jay">Eurasian jay</a> ("Garrulus glandarius"). Along with other corvids such as the rook, <a href="common%20raven">common raven</a> ("Corvus corax"), and <a href="hooded%20crow">hooded crow</a> ("C. cornix"), some western jackdaws spend the winter in urban parks; populations measured in three urban parks in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> show increases from October to December, possibly due to western jackdaws migrating there from areas further north. The same data from Warsaw, collected from 1977 to 2003, showed that the wintering western jackdaw population had increased four-fold. The cause of the increase is unknown, but a reduction in the number of rooks may have benefited the species locally, or rooks overwintering in <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a> may have caused western jackdaws to relocate to Warsaw.

Generally wary of people in the forest or countryside, western jackdaws are much tamer in urban areas. Like <a href="Eurasian%20magpie">magpies</a>, they are known to show interest in shiny objects such as <a href="jewellery">jewellery</a>. <a href="John%20Gay">John Gay</a>, in his "<a href="Beggar%27s%20Opera">Beggar's Opera</a>", notes that "A covetous fellow, like a jackdaw, steals what he was never made to enjoy, for the sake of hiding it". In <a href="Tobias%20Smollett">Tobias Smollett</a>'s "<a href="The%20Expedition%20of%20Humphry%20Clinker">The Expedition of Humphry Clinker</a>", a scathing character assassination runs, "He is ungracious as a hog, greedy as a vulture, and thievish as a jackdaw."

Highly gregarious, western jackdaws are generally seen in flocks of varying sizes, though males and females pair-bond for life and pairs stay together within flocks. Flocks increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for <a href="communal%20roosting">communal roosting</a>, with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site. At <a href="Uppsala">Uppsala</a>, Sweden, 40,000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling together for the night. Western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows or rooks, the latter particularly when migrating or roosting. They have been recorded foraging with the <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a> ("Sturnus vulgaris"), <a href="Northern%20lapwing">Northern lapwing</a> ("Vanellus vanellus"), and <a href="common%20gull">common gull</a> ("Larus canus") in northwestern England. Flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of <a href="lanner%20falcon">lanner falcon</a>s ("Falco biarmicus"), although larger groups are more able to elude the <a href="Predation">predators</a>. Western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as European magpies, common ravens, or <a href="Egyptian%20vulture">Egyptian vulture</a>s ("Neophron percnopterus"); one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group. Occasionally, a sick or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed.

In his book "<a href="King%20Solomon%27s%20Ring%20%28nonfiction%29">King Solomon's Ring</a>", <a href="Konrad%20Lorenz">Konrad Lorenz</a> described and analysed the complex social interactions in a western jackdaw flock that lived around his house in <a href="Sankt%20Andr%C3%A4-W%C3%B6rdern">Altenberg</a>, <a href="Austria">Austria</a>. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual <a href="Bird%20migration">migration</a>. He found that the birds have a <a href="Dominance%20hierarchy">linear hierarchical group structure</a>, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last to have access to food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.

Social hierarchy in western jackdaw flocks is determined by supplanting, fighting, and <a href="threat%20display">threat display</a>s—several of which have been described. In the "bill-up posture", the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness, the posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. A "bill-down posture" is another commonly used <a href="agonistic%20behaviour">agonistic behaviour</a>. In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. Western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues. In the "forward-threat posture", a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. In intense versions, the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females. In the "defensive-threat posture", the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers. "Supplanting" is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch-site. The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight. Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other. Other individuals gather and call noisily.

Western jackdaws entreat their partners to preen them by showing their nape and ruffling their head feathers. Birds mainly preen each other's head and neck. Known as "allopreening", this behaviour is almost always done between birds of a mated pair.

Western jackdaws become sexually mature in their second year. Genetic analysis of pairs and offspring shows no evidence of <a href="extra-pair%20copulation">extra-pair copulation</a> and there is little evidence for couple separation even after multiple instances of reproductive failure. Some pairs do separate in the first few months, but almost all pairings of over six months' duration are lifelong, ending only when a partner dies. Widowed or separated birds fare badly, often being ousted from nests or territories and unable to rear broods alone.

Western jackdaws usually breed in <a href="Bird%20colony">colonies</a> with pairs collaborating to find a nest site, which they then defend from other pairs and predators during most of the year. They nest in cavities in trees or cliffs, in ruined or occupied buildings and in chimneys, the common feature being a sheltered site for the nest. The availability of suitable sites influences their presence in a locale. They may also use church steeples for nesting, a fact reported in verse by 18th century English poet <a href="William%20Cowper">William Cowper</a>:
Nest platforms can attain a great size. A mated pair usually constructs a nest by improving a crevice by dropping sticks into it; it is then built on top of the platform formed. This behaviour has led to the blocking of chimneys and even resulted in nests crashing down into fireplaces, sometimes with birds still on them.

In his "<a href="The%20Natural%20History%20and%20Antiquities%20of%20Selborne">The Natural History of Selborne</a>", <a href="Gilbert%20White">Gilbert White</a> notes that western jackdaws used to nest in crevices beneath the <a href="lintel">lintel</a>s of <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>, and describes an example of the bird using a rabbit burrow for nesting. The species has been recorded outcompeting the <a href="tawny%20owl">tawny owl</a> ("Strix aluco") for nest sites in the Netherlands. They can take over old nest sites of the <a href="black%20woodpecker">black woodpecker</a> ("Dryocopus martius") and <a href="stock%20dove">stock dove</a> ("Columba oenas"). Breeding colonies may also edge out those of the red-billed chough, but in turn be ousted by larger corvids such as the carrion crow, rook or magpie.

Nests are lined with hair, wool, dead grass and many other materials. The <a href="Egg%20%28biology%29">egg</a>s are a lighter colour than those of other corvids, being smooth, a glossy pale blue or blue-green with darker speckles ranging from dark brown to olive or grey-violet. Egg size and weight varies slightly between subspecies; those of subspecies "monedula" average and in weight, those of subspecies "soemmerringii" in size and in weight, and those of subspecies "spermologus" in size and in weight. Clutches usually contain 4 or 5 eggs, although a Slovakian study found clutch sizes ranging from 2 to 9 eggs. The eggs are incubated by the female for 17–18 days until hatching as naked <a href="altricial">altricial</a> chicks, which are completely dependent on the adults for food. They <a href="fledge">fledge</a> after 28–35 days, and the parents continue to feed them for another four weeks or so.

Western jackdaws hatch asynchronously and incubation begins before clutch completion, which often leads to the death of the last-hatched young. If the supply of food is low, parental investment in the brood is kept to a minimum as little energy is wasted on feeding a chick that is unlikely to survive. Replacement clutches are very rarely laid in the event of clutch failure.

The <a href="great%20spotted%20cuckoo">great spotted cuckoo</a> ("Clamator glandarius") has been recorded as a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a> of the western jackdaw, depositing its eggs in their nests in Spain and Israel. Nest robbers include the common raven in Spain, tawny owl, and <a href="least%20weasel">least weasel</a> ("Mustela nivalis") in England, and <a href="brown%20rat">brown rat</a> ("Rattus norvegicus") in Finland. The <a href="European%20pine%20marten">European pine marten</a> ("Martes martes") raids isolated nests in Sweden but is less successful when nests are part of a colony.

Foraging takes place mostly on the ground in open areas and to some extent in trees. <a href="Landfill">Landfill</a> sites, bins, streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about. Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. <a href="Fly">Flies</a> around <a href="Cow%20dung">cow pats</a> are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by dropping vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. <a href="Earthworm">Earthworm</a>s are not usually extracted from the ground by western jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil. Jackdaws will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking <a href="tick">tick</a>s as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight. Compared with other corvids, the western jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.

The western jackdaw tends to feed on small <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s up to in length that are found above ground, including various species of <a href="Coleoptera">beetle</a> (particularly cockchafers of the genus "<a href="Melolontha">Melolontha</a>", and <a href="Curculionidae">weevil</a> <a href="larva">larva</a>e and <a href="pupa">pupa</a>e.), "<a href="Diptera">Diptera</a>", and "<a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a>" species, as well as snails and spiders. Also eaten are small rodents, <a href="bat">bat</a>s, the eggs and chicks of birds, and <a href="carrion">carrion</a> such as <a href="roadkill">roadkill</a>. Vegetable items consumed include farm grains (barley, wheat and oats), weed seeds, elderberries, acorns, and various cultivated fruits. Examination of the <a href="gizzard">gizzard</a>s of western jackdaws shot in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> in spring and summer revealed a diet of cereals (predominantly wheat) and insects (notably <a href="cicada">cicada</a>s and <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s). The diet averages 84% plant material except when breeding, when the main food source is insects. A study in southern Spain examining western jackdaw pellets found that they contained significant amounts of <a href="Silicon%20dioxide">silicaceous</a> and <a href="Calcium%20carbonate">calcareous</a> grit to aid digestion of vegetable food and supply dietary calcium.

Opportunistic and highly adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet markedly depending on available food sources. They have been recorded taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the <a href="skylark">skylark</a> ("Alauda arvensis"), <a href="Manx%20shearwater">Manx shearwater</a> ("Puffinus puffinus"), <a href="razorbill">razorbill</a> ("Alca torda"), <a href="common%20murre">common murre</a> ("Uria aalge"), <a href="grey%20heron">grey heron</a> ("Ardea cinerea"), <a href="rock%20pigeon">rock pigeon</a> ("Columba livia"), and <a href="Eurasian%20collared%20dove">Eurasian collared dove</a> ("Streptopelia decaocto"). A field study of a large city dump on the outskirts of <a href="Le%C3%B3n%2C%20Spain">León</a> in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of <a href="kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a>. The <a href="saker%20falcon">saker falcon</a> ("Falco cherrug") has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in <a href="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a> in Serbia.

Western jackdaws practice active food sharing – where the initiative for the transfer lies with the donor – with a number of individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food. The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including <a href="Common%20chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a>s. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it has been found to be detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualism</a>, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.

Western jackdaws have learned to peck open the foil caps of milk bottles left on the doorsteps after delivery by the milkman. The bacterium "<a href="Campylobacter%20jejuni">Campylobacter jejuni</a>" has been isolated from their beaks and <a href="cloaca">cloaca</a>e so milk can become contaminated as they drink. This activity was linked to cases of "Campylobacter" <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a> in <a href="Gateshead">Gateshead</a> in northeast England and led the <a href="Department%20of%20Health%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Department of Health</a> to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded. It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds from pecking open bottles in the future.

An outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans has been linked to western jackdaws. During a <a href="Autopsy">post-mortem</a> on an affected bird, a <a href="Polyomaviridae">polyomavirus</a> was isolated from the <a href="spleen">spleen</a>. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with "<a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>" and the virus has been provisionally named the <a href="crow%20polyomavirus">crow polyomavirus</a> (CPyV). <a href="Segmented%20filamentous%20bacteria">Segmented filamentous bacteria</a> have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>icity or role is unknown.

The western jackdaw has been hunted as vermin, though not as heavily culled as other species of corvid. After a series of poor harvests in the early 1500s, <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England"></a> introduced a Vermin Act in 1532 "ordeyned to dystroye Choughes (i.e. jackdaws), Crowes and Rokes" to protect grain crops from their predations. Western jackdaws were notorious as they also favoured fruit, especially cherries. This act was taken up in a piecemeal fashion, but <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England"></a> passed the "Act for the Preservation of Grayne" in 1566 that was taken up with more vigour. The species was hunted for its threat to grain crops and for propensity for nesting in belfries until the mid-20th century. Particularly large numbers were culled in the county of <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>. Western jackdaws were also culled on game estates as they raid nests of other birds for eggs. In a 2003 dissertation on public opinion of corvids, Antonia Hereth notes that the German naturalist <a href="Alfred%20Brehm">Alfred Brehm</a> considered the western jackdaw to be a lovable bird, and did not describe any negative impacts of this species on agriculture.

The western jackdaw is one of a very small number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom. The other pest species that can be controlled by trapping are the <a href="carrion%20crow">crow</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20jay">jay</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20magpie">magpie</a> and <a href="Rook%20%28bird%29">rook</a>. An authorised person must comply with the requirements of the <a href="Wildlife%20and%20Countryside%20Act%201981">Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981</a> and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them. As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union <a href="Birds%20Directive">Birds Directive</a>, and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations. Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.

An ancient Greek and Roman adage runs "The swans will sing when the jackdaws are silent", meaning that educated or wise people will speak only after the foolish have become quiet. In <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greek</a> <a href="folklore">folklore</a>, a jackdaw can be caught with a dish of oil. A <a href="Narcissus%20%28mythology%29">narcissistic</a> creature, it falls in while looking at its own reflection. The mythical <a href="Arne%20Sithonis">Princess Arne Sithonis</a> was bribed with gold by <a href="Minos">King Minos</a> of <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, and was punished by the gods for her greed by being transformed into an equally avaricious jackdaw, who still seeks shiny things. The Roman poet <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> described jackdaws as harbingers of rain in his poetic work "<a href="Amores%20%28Ovid%29">Amores</a>". <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a> notes how the <a href="Thessalian">Thessalian</a>s, <a href="Illyrians">Illyrians</a>, and <a href="Lemnian">Lemnian</a>s cherished jackdaws for destroying grasshoppers' eggs. The <a href="Adriatic%20Veneti">Veneti</a> are fabled to have bribed the jackdaws to spare their crops.

In some cultures, a jackdaw on the roof is said to predict a new arrival; alternatively, a jackdaw settling on the roof of a house or flying down a chimney is an omen of death, and coming across one is considered a bad omen. A jackdaw standing on the vanes of a cathedral tower is said to foretell rain. The 12th-century historian <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> records the story of a woman who, upon hearing a jackdaw chattering "more loudly than usual," grew pale and became fearful of suffering a "dreadful calamity", and that "while yet speaking, the messenger of her misfortunes arrived". <a href="Czechs">Czech</a> superstition formerly held that if jackdaws are seen quarreling, war will follow, and that jackdaws will not build nests at <a href="S%C3%A1zava%20%28Bene%C5%A1ov%20District%29">Sázava</a> after being banished by <a href="Procopius%20of%20S%C3%A1zava">Saint Procopius</a>.

The jackdaw was considered sacred in <a href="Welsh%20folklore">Welsh folklore</a> as it nested in church steeples – it was shunned by the Devil because of its choice of residence. Nineteenth century belief in <a href="the%20Fens">the Fens</a> held that seeing a jackdaw on the way to a wedding was a good omen for a bride.

The jackdaw is featured on the <a href="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> town of <a href="Halych">Halych</a>'s ancient coat of arms, the town's name allegedly being derived from the <a href="East%20Slavic%20languages">East Slavic</a> word for the bird. In "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Laughter%20and%20Forgetting">The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</a>" (1979), <a href="Milan%20Kundera">Milan Kundera</a> notes that <a href="Franz%20Kafka">Franz Kafka</a>'s father Hermann had a sign in front of his shop with a jackdaw painted next to his name, since "kavka" means "jackdaw" in <a href="Czech%20language">Czech</a>.

Corvus (constellation)

Corvus is a small <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a>. Its name means "<a href="raven">raven</a>" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, it depicts a raven, a bird associated with stories about the god <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, perched on the back of <a href="Hydra%20%28constellation%29">Hydra</a> the water snake. The four brightest stars, <a href="Gamma%20Corvi">Gamma</a>, <a href="Delta%20Corvi">Delta</a>, <a href="Epsilon%20Corvi">Epsilon</a>, and <a href="Beta%20Corvi">Beta Corvi</a>, form a distinctive quadrilateral in the night sky.

With an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 2.59, Gamma Corvi—also known as Gienah—is the brightest star in the constellation. It is an aging <a href="blue%20giant">blue giant</a> around four times as <a href="solar%20mass">massive as the Sun</a>. The young star <a href="Eta%20Corvi">Eta Corvi</a> has been found to have two <a href="debris%20disk">debris disk</a>s. Three star systems have <a href="exoplanet">exoplanet</a>s, and a fourth <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a> is unconfirmed. <a href="TV%20Corvi">TV Corvi</a> is a <a href="dwarf%20nova">dwarf nova</a>—a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> and <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> in very <a href="binary%20star">close orbit</a>.

In the <a href="Babylonian%20star%20catalogues">Babylonian star catalogues</a> dating from at least 1100 BCE, what later became known as Corvus was called the Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN). As with more familiar <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20astronomy">Classical astronomy</a>, it was placed sitting on the tail of the Serpent (Greek <a href="Lernaean%20Hydra">Hydra</a>). The Babylonian constellation was sacred to <a href="Adad">Adad</a>, the god of rain and storm; in the second Millennium it would have risen just before the autumnal rainy season. John H. Rogers observed that Hydra signified <a href="Ningishzida">Ningishzida</a>, the god of the <a href="underworld">underworld</a> in the Babylonian compendium <a href="MUL.APIN">MUL.APIN</a>. He proposed that Corvus and Crater (along with Hydra) were death symbols and marked the gate to the underworld. These two constellations, along with the eagle <a href="Aquila%20%28constellation%29">Aquila</a> and the fish <a href="Piscis%20Austrinus">Piscis Austrinus</a>, were introduced to the Greeks around 500 BCE; they marked the <a href="winter%20solstice">winter</a> and <a href="summer%20solstice">summer solstice</a>s respectively. Furthermore, Hydra had been a landmark as it had straddled the <a href="celestial%20equator">celestial equator</a> in antiquity. Corvus and Crater also featured in the iconography of <a href="Mithraism">Mithraism</a>, which is thought to have been of middle-eastern origin before spreading into Ancient Greece and Rome.

Corvus is associated with the myth of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> and his lover <a href="Coronis%20%28mythology%29">Coronis</a> the <a href="Lapiths">Lapith</a>. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a pure white crow, he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat <a href="Common%20fig">fig</a>s. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, <a href="Hydra%20%28constellation%29">Hydra</a>, kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (<a href="Crater%20%28constellation%29">Crater</a>), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is just out of reach.

In <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a>, the stars of Corvus are located within the <a href="Vermilion%20Bird%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">Vermilion Bird of the South</a> (南方朱雀, "Nán Fāng Zhū Què"). The four main stars depict a chariot, "Zhen", which is the 28th and final <a href="lunar%20mansion">lunar mansion</a>; Alpha and Eta mark the linchpins for the wheels, and Zeta is "Changsha", a coffin. In <a href="Indian%20astronomy">Indian astronomy</a>, the five main stars of Corvus represent a hand or fist corresponding to the "Hastā", the 13th "<a href="nakshatra">nakshatra</a>" or lunar mansion.

Corvus was recognized as a constellation by several <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>n cultures. In the <a href="Marquesas%20Islands">Marquesas Islands</a>, it was called "Mee"; in <a href="Pukapuka">Pukapuka</a>, it was called "Te Manu", and in the <a href="Society%20Islands">Society Islands</a>, it was called "Metua-ai-papa". To <a href="Torres%20Strait%20Islanders">Torres Strait Islanders</a>, Corvus was the right hand (holding "kupa" fruit) of the huge constellation Tagai, a man fishing.

The <a href="Bororo%20%28Brazil%29">Bororo people</a> of <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a> in central Brazil regarded the constellation as a land tortoise "Geriguigui", while the <a href="Tucano%20people">Tucano people</a> of the northwestern Amazon region saw it as an <a href="egret">egret</a>. To the <a href="Tupi%20people">Tupi people</a> of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Lu%C3%ADs%20Island">São Luís Island</a> in Brazil, Corvus might have been seen as a grill or barbecue—"seychouioura", on which fish were grilled. The depiction could have also referred to the <a href="Great%20Square%20of%20Pegasus">Great Square of Pegasus</a>.

Covering 184 <a href="square%20degree">square degree</a>s and hence 0.446% of the sky, Corvus ranks 70th of the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 constellations</a> in area. It is bordered by <a href="Virgo%20%28constellation%29">Virgo</a> to the north and east, Hydra to the south, and Crater to the west. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Crv'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of six segments ("illustrated in infobox"). In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −11.68° and −25.20°. Its position in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of <a href="65th%20parallel%20north">65°N</a>.

The German cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> used the Greek letters <a href="Alpha">Alpha</a> through <a href="Eta">Eta</a> to label the most prominent stars in the constellation. <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a> gave nine stars <a href="Flamsteed%20designation">Flamsteed designation</a>s, while one star he designated in the neighbouring constellation Crater—<a href="31%20Crateris">31 Crateris</a>—lay within Corvus once the constellation boundaries were established in 1930. Within the constellation's borders, there are 29 stars brighter than or equal to <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 6.5.

Four principal stars, <a href="Delta%20Corvi">Delta</a>, <a href="Gamma%20Corvi">Gamma</a>, <a href="Epsilon%20Corvi">Epsilon</a>, and <a href="Beta%20Corvi">Beta Corvi</a>, form a quadrilateral <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> known as "the "<a href="Spica">Spica</a>'s <a href="Spanker%20%28sail%29">Spanker</a>" or "the Sail". Although none of the stars are particularly bright, they lie in a dim area of the sky, rendering the asterism easy to distinguish in the night sky. Gamma and Delta serve as pointers toward Spica. Also called Gienah, Gamma is the brightest star in Corvus at magnitude 2.59. Its traditional name means "wing", the star marking the left wing in Bayer's "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>". 154±1 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from Earth, it is a blue-white hued <a href="giant%20star">giant star</a> of <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Spectral%20types">spectral type</a> B8III that is times as massive, and 355 times as <a href="solar%20luminosity">luminous as the Sun</a>. Around million years old, it has largely <a href="Stellar%20evolution%23Mature%20stars">exhausted its core hydrogen</a> and begun expanding and cooling as it moves away from the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a>. A <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a>, it has a companion orange or <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> star of spectral type K5V to M5V that is about 0.8 times as massive as the Sun. Around 50 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s distant from Gamma Corvi A, it is estimated to complete an orbit in 158 years. Delta Corvi, traditionally called Algorab, is a <a href="double%20star">double star</a> divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 2.9, around 87 light-years from Earth. An enigmatic star around 2.7 times as massive as the Sun, it is more luminous (65–70 times that of the Sun) than its should be for its surface temperature of 10,400 K, and hence is either a 3.2 million year-old very young pre-main sequence star that has not settled down to a stable main sequence life stage, or a 260-million-year-old star that has begun to exhaust its core hydrogen and expand, cool and shine more brightly as it moves away from the main sequence. Its spectral type is given as A0IV, corresponding with the latter scenario. Warm <a href="circumstellar%20dust">circumstellar dust</a>—by definition part of its inner stellar system—has been detected around Delta Corvi A. Delta Corvi B is an orange dwarf star of magnitude 8.51 and spectral class K, also surrounded by circumstellar dust. A post T-tauri star, it is at least 650 AU distant from its brighter companion and takes at least 9400 years to complete an orbit. Delta Corvi's common name means "the raven". It is one of two stars marking the right wing. Located 4.5 degrees northeast of Delta Corvi is <a href="Struve%201669">Struve 1669</a>, a binary star that is divisible into two stars 5.4" apart by small amateur telescopes, 280 light-years from Earth. The pair, both white stars, is visible to the naked eye at magnitude 5.2; the primary is of magnitude 5.9 and the secondary is of magnitude 6.0.

The raven's breast is marked by Beta Corvi (the proper name is Kraz), a star of magnitude 2.7 located 146 ± 1 light-years from Earth. Roughly 206 million years old and 3.7 ± 1 times as massive as the Sun, it has exhausted its core hydrogen and expanded and cooled to a surface temperature of around 5,100 K and is now a yellow <a href="bright%20giant">bright giant</a> star of spectral type G5II. It likely spent most of its existence as a <a href="B-type%20main-sequence%20star">blue-white main sequence star</a> of spectral type B7V. Bearing the proper name of Minkar and marking the raven's nostril is Epsilon Corvi, located some 318 ± 5 light-years from Earth. It is a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> of spectral type K2III that is around 54 times the <a href="solar%20radius">Sun's radius</a> and 930 times its luminosity. Around 4 times as massive as the Sun, it spent much of its life as a main-sequence star of spectral type B5V. Lying to the south of the quadrilateral between Beta and Epsilon Corvi is the orange-hued <a href="6%20Corvi">6 Corvi</a>, an ageing giant star of spectral type K1III that is around 70 times as luminous as the Sun. It is 331 ± 10 light-years away from Earth.

Named Alchiba, <a href="Alpha%20Corvi">Alpha Corvi</a> is a white-hued star of spectral type F1V and magnitude 4.0, 48.7 ± 0.1 light-years from Earth. It exhibits periodic changes in its spectrum over a three-day period, which suggests it is either a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> or (more likely) a pulsating <a href="Gamma%20Doradus%20variable">Gamma Doradus</a>-type variable. If the latter is the case, it is estimated to be 1.39 times as massive as the Sun. According to Bayer's atlas, it lies above the bird's beak.

Marking the raven's right wing is <a href="Eta%20Corvi">Eta Corvi</a>, a yellow-white main-sequence star of type F2V that is 1.52 times as massive and 4.87 times as luminous as the Sun. It is 59 light-years distant from our Solar System. Two <a href="debris%20disk">debris disk</a>s have been detected orbiting this star, one warm within 3.5 astronomical units and another out at ~150 astronomical units distant. <a href="Zeta%20Corvi">Zeta Corvi</a> marks the raven's neck. It is of apparent magnitude 5.21, separated by 7 arcseconds from the star <a href="HR%204691">HR 4691</a>. Located 420 ± 10 light-years distant, it is a blue-white <a href="Be%20star">Be star</a> of spectral type B8V, the presence of hydrogen emission lines in its spectrum indicating it has a <a href="circumstellar%20disc">circumstellar disc</a>. These stars may be an optical double or a true multiple star system, with a separation of at least 50,000 astronomical units and the stars taking 3.5 million years to orbit each other. HR 4691 is itself double, composed of an ageing yellow-orange giant whose spectral type has been calculated at K0 or G3, and an <a href="F-type%20main-sequence%20star">F-type main-sequence star</a>.
31 Crateris (which was originally placed in Crater by Flamsteed) is a 5.26 magnitude star which was once mistaken for a <a href="Mercury%27s%20moon">moon of Mercury</a>. On 27 March 1974, the "<a href="Mariner%2010">Mariner 10</a>" mission detected emissions in the far ultraviolet from the planet (suggesting a satellite), but they were found to emanate from the star. It is in reality a remote binary star system with a hot blue-white star of spectral type B1.5V and a companion about which little is known. The two stars orbit each other every 2.9631 days. The primary is possibly a <a href="blue%20straggler">blue straggler</a> of the Hyades group. The primary is around 15.5 times as massive as the Sun and 52262 times as luminous.

<a href="VV%20Corvi">VV Corvi</a> is a close spectroscopic binary, its two component stars orbiting each other with a <a href="orbital%20period">period</a> of 1.46 days. Both are yellow-white main-sequence stars of spectral type F5V, though the primary has begun expanding and cooling as it nears the end of its time on the main sequence. The mass ratio of the two stars is 0.775 ± 0.024. A tertiary companion was discovered during the <a href="Two%20Micron%20All-Sky%20Survey">Two Micron All-Sky Survey</a>. <a href="W%20Corvi">W Corvi</a> is an eclipsing binary that varies in brightness from apparent magnitude 11.16 to 12.5 over 9 hours. Its period has increased by 1/4 second over a century. It is an unusual system in that its two stars are very close to each other yet have different surface temperatures, and hence thermal transfer is not taking place as expected. <a href="SX%20Corvi">SX Corvi</a> is an eclipsing binary that is also a contact binary known as a <a href="W%20Ursae%20Majoris%20variable">W Ursae Majoris variable</a>. The two component stars orbit closely enough to each other for mass to have been transferred between them—in this case the secondary having transferred a large amount of mass to the primary. <a href="RV%20Corvi">RV Corvi</a> is another eclipsing binary. Its brightness varies from apparent magnitude 8.6 to 9.16 over 18 hours. The system is composed of stars of spectral types F0 and G0, which orbit each other every 0.7473 days.

Close to Gamma Corvi and visible in the same binocular field is <a href="R%20Corvi">R Corvi</a>, a long period (<a href="Mira%20variable">Mira</a>) variable star. It ranges in brightness from a magnitude of 6.7 to 14.4 with a period of approximately 317 days. <a href="TT%20Corvi">TT Corvi</a> is a <a href="semiregular%20variable%20star">semiregular variable</a> red giant of spectral type M3III and apparent magnitude 6.48 around 923 light years distant. It is around 993 times as luminous as the Sun. <a href="TU%20Corvi">TU Corvi</a> is a <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a>—a class of short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as <a href="Cosmic%20distance%20ladder%23Standard%20candles">standard candles</a> and as subjects to study <a href="astroseismology">astroseismology</a>. It varies by 0.025 of a magnitude around apparent magnitude 6.53 over 59 minutes.

Three star systems have confirmed planets. <a href="HD%20103774">HD 103774</a> is a young yellow-white main-sequence star of apparent magnitude 7.12 that is 181 ± 5 light-years distant from Earth. It is 1.335 ± 0.03 times as massive and 3.5 ± 0.3 as luminous as the Sun. Variations in its radial velocity showed it was being orbited by a <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a>-sized planet every 5.9 days in 2013. <a href="HD%20104067">HD 104067</a> is an orange dwarf of spectral type K2V of apparent magnitude 7.93 that is 69 ± 1 light-years distant from Earth. Around 80% as massive as the Sun, it is orbited by a planet 3.6 times the mass of Neptune every 55.8 days. <a href="WASP-83">WASP-83</a> has a planet around as massive as <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a> that orbits it every 5 days. It was discovered by its transit across the star in 2015. A fourth star system has an unconfirmed planet. <a href="HD%20111031">HD 111031</a> is a sunlike star of spectral type G5V located 101 ± 2 light-years distant from Earth.

<a href="Ross%20695">Ross 695</a> is a red dwarf star located a mere 28.9 ± 0.6 light-years distant from Earth. At apparent magnitude 11.27, it is much too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. A small star, it has around 23% the mass and radius of the Sun, but only 0.7% its luminosity. <a href="VHS%201256-1257">VHS 1256-1257</a> is a <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> of spectral type M7.5 located 41 ± 3 light-years distant from Earth. Around 73 times as massive as <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, it is just under the mass boundary separating brown dwarves from stars. It has a companion that was first identified and documented by the <a href="2MASS">2MASS</a> survey in 2015. It orbits at a distance of 102 ± 9 <a href="astronomical%20units">AU</a> and has an estimated mass of approximately 11 times Jupiter's. <a href="DENIS-P%20J1228.2-1547">DENIS-P J1228.2-1547</a> is a system composed of two brown dwarfs orbiting each other located 73 ± 3 light-years away from Earth. <a href="TV%20Corvi">TV Corvi</a> is a <a href="dwarf%20nova">dwarf nova</a> composed of a white dwarf and brown dwarf that orbit each other every 90 minutes. The system has a baseline magnitude of 17 that brightens periodically to magnitude 12, discovered by <a href="Clyde%20Tombaugh">Clyde Tombaugh</a> in 1931 and David Levy in 1990 and 2005.

Corvus contains no <a href="Messier%20object">Messier object</a>s. It has several galaxies and a <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a> observable with amateur telescopes. The center of Corvus is home to a planetary nebula, <a href="NGC%204361">NGC 4361</a>. The nebula itself resembles a small <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical galaxy</a> and has a magnitude of 10.3, but the magnitude 13 star at its centre gives away its true nature.

The <a href="NGC%204038%20Group">NGC 4038 Group</a> is a <a href="Galaxy%20groups%20and%20clusters">group of galaxies</a> across Corvus and Crater. The group may contain between 13 and 27 galaxies. The best-known member is the <a href="Antennae%20Galaxies">Antennae</a> <a href="peculiar%20galaxy">peculiar galaxy</a>, located 0.25 north of 31 Crateris. It consists of two <a href="galaxy%20merger">interacting</a> galaxies—NGC 4038 and 4039—that appear to have a heart shape as seen from Earth. The name originates from the huge <a href="tidal%20tail">tidal tail</a>s that come off the ends of the two galaxies, formed because of the spiral galaxies' original rotation. Both original galaxies were <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxies</a> and are now experiencing extensive <a href="star%20formation">star formation</a> due to the interaction of gas clouds. The galaxies are 45 million light-years from Earth and each has multiple <a href="ultraluminous%20X-ray%20source">ultraluminous X-ray source</a>s, the source of which is unknown. Astronomers theorize that they may be a rare type of x-ray emitting binary stars or <a href="intermediate-mass%20black%20hole">intermediate-mass black hole</a>s. The Antennae Galaxies appear in a telescope at the 10th magnitude. <a href="SN%202004gt">SN 2004gt</a> was a <a href="type%20Ic%20supernova">type Ic supernova</a> that erupted on December 12, 2004. The progenitor was not identified from older images of the galaxy, and is either a type WC <a href="Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet%20star">Wolf–Rayet star</a> with a mass over 40 times that of the Sun, or a star 20 to 40 times as massive as the Sun in a binary star system. <a href="SN%202007sr">SN 2007sr</a> was a <a href="Type%20Ia%20supernova">Type Ia supernova</a> event that peaked in brightness on December 14, 2007. The galaxy has been identified as a good place to take detailed images in case of further supernovae.

<a href="NGC%204027">NGC 4027</a> is another member of the NGC 4038 group, notable for its extended spiral arm. Known as the Ringtail Galaxy, it lies close to 31 Crateris. A barred spiral galaxy, its distorted shape is probably due to a past collision, possibly with the nearby NGC 4027A. <a href="NGC%204782">NGC 4782</a> and <a href="NGC%204783">NGC 4783</a> are a pair of merging elliptical galaxies in the northeastern part of the constellation, around 200 million light-years distant.

Two established <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a>s originate from within Corvus' boundaries. German astronomer <a href="Cuno%20Hoffmeister">Cuno Hoffmeister</a> discovered and named the Corvids in 1937, after observing them between June 25 and July 2. They have not been seen since, nor was there evidence of a shower when previous records were examined. Hoffmeister noted the trajectory of the shower was similar to that of the comet <a href="11P/Tempel%E2%80%93Swift%E2%80%93LINEAR">11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR</a>, though this was not confirmed by Zhukov and colleagues in 2011. The shower has been tentatively linked with <a href="4015%20Wilson%E2%80%93Harrington">4015 Wilson–Harrington</a>. In January 2013, the MO Video Meteor Network published the discovery of the <a href="Eta%20Corvids">Eta Corvids</a>, assigning some 300 meteors seen between January 20 and 26. Their existence was confirmed by data analysis later that year.

In 1624, German astronomer <a href="Jakob%20Bartsch">Jakob Bartsch</a> equated the constellation <a href="Argo%20Navis">Argo Navis</a> with <a href="Noah%27s%20Ark">Noah's Ark</a>, linking Corvus and Columba to the crow and dove that feature in the <a href="Genesis%20flood%20narrative">story in Genesis</a>.

In "<a href="Action%20Comics">Action Comics</a>" #14 (January 2013), which was published 7 November 2012, astrophysicist <a href="Neil%20deGrasse%20Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> appears in the story, in which he determines that <a href="Superman">Superman</a>'s home planet, <a href="Krypton%20%28comics%29">Krypton</a>, orbited the red dwarf <a href="LHS%202520">LHS 2520</a> in the constellation Corvus, 27.1 light-years from Earth. Tyson assisted <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> in selecting a real-life star that would be an appropriate parent star to Krypton, and picked the star in Corvus, and which is the mascot of Superman's high school, the <a href="Smallville%20%28comics%29">Smallville</a> Crows.

Messier 87

Messier 87 (also known as Virgo A or NGC 4486, generally abbreviated to M87) is a <a href="Type-cD%20galaxy">supergiant</a> <a href="elliptical%20galaxy">elliptical galaxy</a> in the constellation <a href="Virgo%20%28constellation%29">Virgo</a>. One of the most massive galaxies in the local Universe, it is notable for its large population of <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s—about 12,000 compared to the 150–200 orbiting the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>—and its jet of energetic <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> that originates at the core and extends at least , traveling at <a href="relativistic%20speed">relativistic speed</a>. It is one of the brightest radio sources in the sky, and a popular target for both amateur and professional astronomers.

The French astronomer <a href="Charles%20Messier">Charles Messier</a> discovered M87 in 1781, and catalogued it as a <a href="Nebula">nebulous</a> feature while searching for objects that would otherwise confuse comet hunters. M87 is located about from Earth and is the second-brightest galaxy within the northern <a href="Virgo%20Cluster">Virgo Cluster</a>, having many <a href="Satellite%20galaxy">satellite galaxies</a>. Unlike a disk-shaped <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a>, M87 has no distinctive <a href="dust%20lane">dust lane</a>s. Instead, it has an almost featureless, <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>al shape typical of most giant elliptical galaxies, diminishing in <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> with distance from the center. Forming around one sixth of its mass, M87's <a href="star">star</a>s have a nearly spherically symmetric distribution. Their population density decreases with increasing distance from the core. It has an active <a href="supermassive%20black%20hole">supermassive black hole</a> at its core, which forms the primary component of an <a href="active%20galactic%20nucleus">active galactic nucleus</a>.

The galaxy is a strong source of multiwavelength radiation, particularly <a href="radio%20wave">radio wave</a>s. Its galactic envelope extends to a radius of about , where it is truncated—possibly by an <a href="Galaxy%20merger">encounter</a> with another galaxy. Its <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> consists of diffuse gas enriched by elements emitted from <a href="evolved%20star">evolved star</a>s.

In 1781, the French astronomer Charles Messier published a <a href="Messier%20object">catalogue</a> of 103 objects that had a nebulous appearance as part of a list intended to identify objects that might otherwise be confused with <a href="comet">comet</a>s. In subsequent use, each catalogue entry was prefixed with an "M". Thus, M87 was the eighty-seventh object listed in Messier's catalogue. During the 1880s, the object was included as NGC 4486, in the "<a href="New%20General%20Catalogue">New General Catalogue</a>" of nebulae and star clusters assembled by the Danish-Irish astronomer <a href="John%20Louis%20Emil%20Dreyer">John Dreyer</a>, which he based primarily on the observations of the English astronomer <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a>.

In 1918, the American astronomer <a href="Heber%20Doust%20Curtis">Heber Curtis</a> of <a href="Lick%20Observatory">Lick Observatory</a> noted M87's lack of a spiral structure and observed a "curious straight ray ... apparently connected with the nucleus by a thin line of matter." The ray appeared brightest near the galactic center. The following year, a <a href="supernova">supernova</a> within M87 reached a peak <a href="photographic%20magnitude">photographic magnitude</a> of 21.5, although this event was not reported until photographic plates were examined by the Russian astronomer in 1922.

In 1922, the American astronomer <a href="Edwin%20Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a> categorized M87 as one of the brighter globular nebulae, as it lacked any spiral structure, but like spiral nebulae, appeared to belong to the family of non-galactic nebulae. In 1926 he produced a new categorization, distinguishing extragalactic from galactic nebulae, the former being independent star systems. M87 was <a href="galaxy%20morphology%20classification">classified</a> as a type of elliptical extragalactic nebula with no apparent elongation (class E0).

In 1931, Hubble described M87 as a member of the <a href="Virgo%20Cluster">Virgo Cluster</a>, and gave a provisional estimate of from Earth. It was then the only known elliptical nebula for which individual stars could be <a href="optical%20resolution">resolved</a>, although it was pointed out that globular clusters would be indistinguishable from individual stars at such distances. In his 1936 "The Realm of the Nebulae", Hubble examines the terminology of the day; some astronomers labeled extragalactic nebulae as "external galaxies" on the basis that they were stellar systems at far distances from our own galaxy, while others preferred the conventional term "extragalactic nebulae", as "galaxy" then was synonym for the Milky Way. M87 continued to be labelled as an extragalactic nebula at least until 1954.

In 1947, a prominent <a href="Radio%20astronomy">radio</a> source, Virgo A, was identified overlapping the location of M87. The source was confirmed to be M87 by 1953, and the linear <a href="Astrophysical%20jet%23Relativistic%20jet">relativistic jet</a> emerging from the core of the galaxy was suggested as the cause. This jet extended from the core at a <a href="position%20angle">position angle</a> of 260° to an <a href="angular%20distance">angular distance</a> of 20<a href="arcsecond">″</a> with an angular width of 2″. In 1969–70, a strong component of the radio emission was found to closely align with the optical source of the jet.

In 1966, the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Research%20Laboratory">United States Naval Research Laboratory</a>'s <a href="Aerobee">Aerobee</a> 150 rocket identified Virgo X-1, the first X-ray source in Virgo. The Aerobee rocket launched from <a href="White%20Sands%20Missile%20Range">White Sands Missile Range</a> on 7 July 1967, yielded further evidence that the source of Virgo X-1 was the radio galaxy M87. Subsequent X-ray observations by the <a href="High%20Energy%20Astronomy%20Observatory%201">HEAO 1</a> and <a href="Einstein%20Observatory">Einstein Observatory</a> showed a complex source that included the active galactic nucleus of M87. However, there is little central concentration of the X-ray emission.

M87 has been an important testing ground for techniques that measure the masses of central supermassive black holes in galaxies. In 1978, <a href="stellar-dynamical">stellar-dynamical</a> modeling of the mass distribution in M87 gave evidence for a central mass of five billion <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es. After the installation of the <a href="COSTAR">COSTAR</a> corrective-optics module in the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> in 1993, the Hubble <a href="Faint%20Object%20Spectrograph">Faint Object Spectrograph</a> (FOS) was used to measure the <a href="rotation%20velocity">rotation velocity</a> of the ionized gas disk at the center of M87, as an "early release observation" designed to test the scientific performance of the post-repair Hubble instruments. The FOS data indicated a central black hole mass of 2.4 billion solar masses, with 30% uncertainty.

M87 is located near the high <a href="declination">declination</a> border of the Virgo constellation, next to the constellation of <a href="Coma%20Berenices">Coma Berenices</a>. It lies along the line between the stars <a href="Epsilon%20Virginis">Epsilon Virginis</a> and <a href="Denebola">Denebola</a>. At an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 9.59, the galaxy can be observed using a small telescope with a <a href="aperture">aperture</a>, extending across an angular area of 7.2 × 6.8 <a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc">arcminutes</a> with a bright, 45-<a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc">arcsecond</a> core. Viewing the jet is a challenge without the aid of photography. Before 1991, the Russian-American astronomer <a href="Otto%20Struve">Otto Struve</a> was the only person known to have seen the jet visually, using the <a href="Mount%20Wilson%20Observatory">Hooker telescope</a>. In more recent years it has been observed in larger amateur telescopes under excellent conditions.

In the modified <a href="Hubble%20sequence">Hubble sequence</a> <a href="galaxy%20morphological%20classification">galaxy morphological classification</a> scheme of the French astronomer <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20de%20Vaucouleurs">Gérard de Vaucouleurs</a>, M87 is categorized as an E0p galaxy. "E0" designates an elliptical galaxy that displays no flattening—that is, it appears spherical. A "p" suffix indicates a <a href="peculiar%20galaxy">peculiar galaxy</a> that does not fit cleanly into the classification scheme; in this case, the peculiarity is the presence of the jet emerging from the core. In the <a href="Galaxy%20morphological%20classification%23Yerkes%20%28or%20Morgan%29%20scheme">Yerkes (Morgan) scheme</a>, M87 is classified as a <a href="type-cD%20galaxy">type-cD galaxy</a>. A D galaxy has an elliptical-like nucleus surrounded by an extensive, dustless, diffuse envelope. A D type supergiant is called a cD galaxy.

The distance to M87 has been estimated using several independent techniques. These include measurement of the luminosity of <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a>e, comparison with nearby galaxies whose distance is estimated using <a href="Cosmic%20distance%20ladder">standard candles</a> such as <a href="cepheid%20variable">cepheid variable</a>s, the linear size distribution of <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s, and the <a href="tip%20of%20the%20red-giant%20branch">tip of the red-giant branch</a> method using individually resolved <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> stars. These measurements are consistent with each other, and their <a href="Weighted%20arithmetic%20mean">weighted average</a> yields a distance estimate of .

M87 is one of the most massive galaxies in the local Universe. It spans a diameter of 120 thousand light-years, which is slightly lower than that of the Milky Way, but M87 is a spheroid, not a flat spiral. The mass of M87 within a radius ("r") of from the core steadily increases roughly <a href="Proportionality%20%28mathematics%29">in proportion</a> to "r". Within a radius of , the mass is times the <a href="solar%20mass">mass of the Sun</a>, which is double the mass of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy. Only a fraction of this mass is in the form of stars. M87 has an estimated mass to luminosity ratio of ; that is, about one part in six of the galaxy's mass is in the form of stars that radiate energy. The total mass of M87 may be 200 times that of the Milky Way.

Gas is infalling into the galaxy at the rate of two to three solar masses per year, most of which may be accreted onto the core region. The extended stellar envelope of this galaxy reaches a radius of about , compared to about for the Milky Way. Beyond that distance the outer edge of the galaxy has been truncated by some means; possibly by an earlier encounter with another galaxy. There is evidence of linear streams of stars to the northwest of the galaxy, which may have been created by <a href="tidal%20stripping">tidal stripping</a> of orbiting galaxies or by small <a href="Satellite%20galaxy">satellite galaxies</a> falling in toward M87. Moreover, a filament of hot, ionized gas in the northeastern outer part of the galaxy may be the remnant of a small, gas-rich galaxy that was disrupted by M87 and could be feeding its active nucleus. M87 is estimated to have at least 50 satellite galaxies, including <a href="NGC%204486B">NGC 4486B</a> and <a href="NGC%204478">NGC 4478</a>.

The spectrum of the nuclear region of M87 shows the <a href="emission%20line">emission line</a>s of various ions, including hydrogen (HI, HII), helium (HeI), oxygen (OI, OII, OIII), nitrogen (NI), magnesium (MgII) and sulfur (SII). The line intensities for weakly ionized atoms (such as neutral <a href="atomic%20oxygen">atomic oxygen</a>, OI) are stronger than those of strongly ionized atoms (such as <a href="doubly%20ionized%20oxygen">doubly ionized oxygen</a>, OIII). A galactic nucleus with such spectral properties is termed a LINER, for "<a href="low-ionization%20nuclear%20emission-line%20region">low-ionization nuclear emission-line region</a>". The mechanism and source of weak-line-dominated ionization in LINERs and M87 are under debate. Possible causes include shock-induced excitation in the outer parts of the disk or <a href="photoionization">photoionization</a> in the inner region powered by the jet.

Elliptical galaxies such as M87 are believed to form as the result of one or more mergers of smaller galaxies. They generally contain relatively little cold <a href="Interstellar%20medium">interstellar gas</a> (in comparison with spiral galaxies) and they are populated mostly by old stars, with little or no ongoing star formation. M87's elliptical shape is maintained by the random orbital motions of its constituent stars, in contrast to the more orderly rotational motions found in a <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> such as the Milky Way. Using the <a href="Very%20Large%20Telescope">Very Large Telescope</a> to study the motions of about 300 planetary nebulae, astronomers have determined that M87 absorbed a medium-sized star-forming spiral galaxy over the last billion years. This has resulted in the addition of some younger, bluer stars to M87. The distinctive spectral properties of the planetary nebulae allowed astronomers to discover a chevron-like structure in M87's halo which was produced by the incomplete <a href="Phase%20space">phase-space</a> mixing of a disrupted galaxy.

The core contains a supermassive black hole that weighs billions of times the Sun's mass:
estimates have ranged from 
to ,
with the latest measurement being .
This mass is one of the <a href="List%20of%20most%20massive%20black%20holes">highest known</a> for such an object. A rotating disk of ionized gas surrounds the black hole, and is roughly perpendicular to the relativistic jet. The disk rotates at velocities of up to roughly 1,000 km/s, and spans a maximum diameter of . Gas <a href="Bondi%20accretion">accretes</a> onto the black hole at an estimated rate of one solar mass every ten years (about 90 <a href="earth%20mass">earth mass</a>es per day).

Observation suggests that the black hole may be displaced from the galactic center by about . The displacement is in the opposite direction of the one-sided jet, which may indicate that the black hole was accelerated away by the jet. Another possibility is that the change in location occurred during the merger of two supermassive black holes. A 2011 study did not find any statistically significant displacement.

The space between the stars in M87 is filled with a diffuse interstellar medium of gas that has been chemically enriched by the elements ejected from stars as they passed beyond their <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> lifetime. Carbon and nitrogen are continuously supplied by stars of intermediate mass as they pass through the <a href="asymptotic%20giant%20branch">asymptotic giant branch</a>. The heavier elements from oxygen to iron are produced largely by <a href="supernova">supernova</a> explosions within the galaxy. Of the heavy elements, about 60% were produced by core-collapse supernovae, while the remainder came from <a href="type%20Ia%20supernova">type Ia supernova</a>e. The distribution of oxygen is roughly uniform throughout, at about half of the <a href="Sun%23Composition">solar value</a> (i.e., oxygen abundance in the Sun), while iron distribution peaks near the center where it approaches the solar iron value. Since oxygen is produced mainly by core-collapse supernovae, which occur during the early stages of galaxies and mostly in outer star-forming regions, the distribution of these elements suggests an early enrichment of the interstellar medium from core-collapse supernovae and a continuous contribution from Type Ia supernovae throughout the history of M87. The contribution of elements from these sources was much lower than in the Milky Way.

Examination of M87 at far <a href="infrared">infrared</a> wavelengths shows an excess emission at wavelengths longer than 25 μm. Normally, this may be an indication of <a href="Thermal%20radiation">thermal emission</a> by warm dust. In the case of M87, the emission can be fully explained by <a href="synchrotron%20radiation">synchrotron radiation</a> from the jet; within the galaxy, silicate grains are expected to survive for no more than 46 million years because of the X-ray emission from the core. This dust may be destroyed by the hostile environment or expelled from the galaxy. The combined mass of dust in M87 is no more than 70,000 times the mass of the Sun. By comparison, the Milky Way's dust equals about a hundred million (10) solar masses.

Although M87 is an elliptical galaxy and therefore lacks the dust lanes of a <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a>, optical filaments have been observed in it, which arise from gas falling towards the core. Emission probably comes from shock-induced excitation as the falling gas streams encounter X-rays from the core region. These filaments have an estimated mass of about 10,000 solar masses. Surrounding the galaxy is an extended corona with hot, low-density gas.

M87 has an abnormally large population of <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s. A 2006 survey out to an <a href="angular%20distance">angular distance</a> of 25<a href="arcminute">′</a> from the core estimates that there are globular clusters in orbit around M87, compared to 150–200 in and around the Milky Way. The clusters are similar in size distribution to those of the Milky Way, most having an effective radius of 1 to 6 parsecs. The size of the M87 clusters gradually increases with distance from the galactic center. Within a radius of the core, the cluster <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a>—the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium—is about half the abundance in the Sun. Outside this radius, metallicity steadily declines as the cluster distance from the core increases. Clusters with low metallicity are somewhat larger than metal-rich clusters. In 2014, <a href="HVGC-1">HVGC-1</a>, the first hypervelocity globular cluster, was discovered escaping from M87 at 2,300 km/s. The escape of the cluster with such a high velocity may have been the result of a close encounter with, and subsequent gravitational kick from, a supermassive black hole binary. If this interpretation is correct, the core of M87 would have two supermassive black holes, the result of an ancient <a href="Galaxy%20merger">collision</a> between two galaxies which merged into a single giant galaxy.

Almost a hundred ultra-compact <a href="Dwarf%20galaxy">dwarfs</a> have been identified in M87. They resemble globular clusters but have a diameter of or more, much larger than the maximum of globular clusters. It is unclear whether they are dwarf galaxies captured by M87 or a new class of massive globular cluster.

The <a href="Astrophysical%20jet">relativistic jet</a> of matter emerging from the core extends at least from the nucleus and consists of matter ejected from a supermassive black hole. The jet is highly <a href="Collimated%20beam">collimated</a>, appearing constrained to an angle of 60° within of the core, to about 16° at , and to 6–7° at . Its base has the diameter of <a href="Schwarzschild%20radius">Schwarzschild radii</a>, and is probably powered by a <a href="Retrograde%20and%20prograde%20motion">prograde</a> accretion disk around a spinning supermassive black hole. The German-American astronomer <a href="Walter%20Baade">Walter Baade</a> found that light from the jet was <a href="Linear%20polarization">plane polarized</a>, which suggests that the energy is generated by the acceleration of electrons moving at <a href="Special%20relativity">relativistic velocities</a> in a <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>. The total energy of these electrons is estimated at 5.1 × 10 <a href="erg">erg</a>s (5.1 × 10 <a href="joule">joule</a>s or 3.2 × 10 <a href="Electronvolt">eV</a>). This is roughly 10 times the energy produced by the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> in one second, which is estimated at 5 × 10 joules. The jet is surrounded by a lower-velocity non-relativistic component. There is evidence of a counter jet, but it remains unseen from the Earth due to <a href="relativistic%20beaming">relativistic beaming</a>. The jet is <a href="precession">precessing</a>, causing the outflow to form a helical pattern out to . Lobes of expelled matter extend out to .

In pictures taken by the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This phenomenon, called <a href="superluminal%20motion">superluminal motion</a>, is an illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet. The time interval between any two light pulses emitted by the jet is, as registered by the observer, less than the actual interval due to the relativistic speed of the jet moving in the direction of the observer. This results in perceived <a href="faster-than-light">faster-than-light</a> speeds. Detection of such motion is used to support the theory that <a href="quasar">quasar</a>s, <a href="BL%20Lacertae%20object">BL Lacertae object</a>s and <a href="Radio%20galaxy">radio galaxies</a> may all be the same phenomenon, known as <a href="active%20galactic%20nucleus">active galaxies</a>, viewed from different perspectives. It is proposed that M87 is a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from a relatively large angle. Flux variations, characteristic of the BL Lacertae objects, have been observed in M87.
Observations indicate that the rate at which material is ejected from the supermassive black hole is variable. These variations produce pressure waves in the hot gas surrounding M87. The <a href="Chandra%20X-ray%20Observatory">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> has detected loops and rings in the gas. Their distribution suggests that minor eruptions occur every few million years. One of the rings, caused by a major eruption, is a shock wave in diameter around the black hole. Other features observed include narrow X-ray-emitting filaments up to long, and a large cavity in the hot gas caused by a major eruption 70 million years ago. The regular eruptions prevent a huge reservoir of gas from cooling and forming stars, implying that M87's evolution may have been seriously affected, preventing it from becoming a large <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a>. These observations also indicate that the variable eruptions produce sound waves of about 56 to 59 <a href="octave">octave</a>s below <a href="C%20%28musical%20note%29">middle C</a> in the medium.

M87 is a very strong source of <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s, the most energetic rays of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gamma rays emitted by M87 have been observed since the late 1990s. In 2006, using the <a href="High%20Energy%20Stereoscopic%20System">High Energy Stereoscopic System</a> Cherenkov telescopes, scientists measured the variations of the gamma ray flux coming from M87, and found that the flux changes over a matter of days. This short period indicates that the most likely source of the gamma rays is a supermassive black hole. In general, the smaller the diameter of the emission source, the faster the variation in flux, and vice versa.

A knot of matter in the jet (designated HST-1), about from the core, has been tracked by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. By 2006, the X-ray intensity of this knot had increased by a factor of 50 over a four-year period, while the X-ray emission has since been decaying in a variable manner.

The interaction of relativistic jets of plasma emanating from the core with the surrounding medium gives rise to <a href="radio%20lobe">radio lobe</a>s in active galaxies. The lobes occur in pairs and are often symmetrical. The two radio lobes of M87 together span about 80 kiloparsecs; the inner parts, extending up to two kiloparsecs, emit strongly at radio wavelengths. Two flows of material emerge from this region, one aligned with the jet itself and the other in the opposite direction. The flows are asymmetrical and deformed, implying that they encounter a dense intracluster medium. At greater distances, both flows diffuse into two lobes. The lobes are surrounded by a fainter halo of radio-emitting gas.

M87 is near the center of the <a href="Virgo%20Cluster">Virgo Cluster</a>, a closely compacted structure of about 2,000 galaxies. It forms the core of the larger <a href="Virgo%20Supercluster">Virgo Supercluster</a>, of which the <a href="Local%20Group">Local Group</a> (including the Milky Way) is an outlying member. It is organized into at least three distinct subsystems associated with the three large galaxies—M87, <a href="Messier%2049">M49</a> and <a href="Messier%2086">M86</a>—with the subgroup centered around M87 ("Virgo A") and M49 ("Virgo B"). There is a preponderance of elliptical and <a href="Lenticular%20galaxy">S0 galaxies</a> around M87, with a chain of elliptical galaxies aligned with the jet. In terms of mass, M87 is a dominant member of the cluster, and hence appears to be moving very little relative to the cluster as a whole. It is defined as the cluster center. The cluster has a sparse gaseous atmosphere that emits X-rays that decrease in temperature toward the middle, where M87 is located. The combined mass of the cluster is estimated to be (0.15–1.5) × 10 solar masses.

Measurements of the motion of intracluster <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a>e between M87 and M86 suggest that the two galaxies are moving toward each other and that this may be their first encounter. M87 may have interacted with <a href="Messier%2084">M84</a> in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of M87's outer halo by <a href="Tidal%20force">tidal interactions</a>. The truncated halo may also have been caused by contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 from the rest of the cluster, which may be the hypothesized <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a>. A third possibility is that the halo's formation was truncated by early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.

Pavo (constellation)

Pavo is a <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">southern sky</a> whose name is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "<a href="peafowl">peacock</a>." Pavo first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a> and was depicted in <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s star atlas "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" of 1603, and was likely conceived by <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> from the observations of <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a>. French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> gave its stars <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s in 1756. The constellations Pavo, <a href="Grus%20%28constellation%29">Grus</a>, <a href="Phoenix%20%28constellation%29">Phoenix</a> and <a href="Tucana">Tucana</a> are collectively known as the "Southern Birds".

The constellation's brightest member, <a href="Alpha%20Pavonis">Alpha Pavonis</a>, is also known as Peacock and appears as a 1.91-<a href="Apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> blue-white star, but is actually a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a>. <a href="Delta%20Pavonis">Delta Pavonis</a> is a nearby <a href="Sun">Sun</a>-like star some 19.9 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s distant. Six of the <a href="star%20system">star system</a>s in Pavo have been found to host planets, including <a href="HD%20181433">HD 181433</a> with a <a href="Super-Earth">super-earth</a>, and <a href="HD%20172555">HD 172555</a> with evidence of a major interplanetary collision in the past few thousand years. The constellation contains <a href="NGC%206752">NGC 6752</a>, the third-brightest <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a> in the sky, and the <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> <a href="NGC%206744">NGC 6744</a>, which closely resembles the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> but is twice as large. Pavo displays an annual <a href="meteor%20shower">meteor shower</a> known as the Delta Pavonids, whose <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiant</a> is near the star <a href="Delta%20Pavonis">δ Pav</a>.

Pavo was one of the twelve constellations established by <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> from the observations of the southern sky by explorers <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</a> and <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a>, who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the "<a href="First%20Dutch%20Expedition%20to%20Indonesia">Eerste Schipvaart</a>", to the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14 in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with <a href="Jodocus%20Hondius">Jodocus Hondius</a>. The first depiction of this constellation in a <a href="celestial%20atlas">celestial atlas</a> was in German cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" of 1603. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name "De Pauww", "The Peacock". Pavo and the nearby constellations <a href="Phoenix%20%28constellation%29">Phoenix</a>, <a href="Grus%20%28constellation%29">Grus</a> and <a href="Tucana">Tucana</a> are collectively called the "Southern Birds".

According to Mark Chartrand, former executive director of the <a href="National%20Space%20Institute">National Space Institute</a>, Plancius may not have been the first to designate this group of stars as a peacock: "In Greek myth the stars that are now the Peacock were Argos [or Argus], builder of the ship Argo. He was changed by the goddess Juno into a peacock and placed in the sky along with his ship." Indeed, the peacock "symboliz[ed] the starry firmament" for the Greeks, and the goddess Hera was believed to drive through the heavens in a chariot drawn by peacocks.

The peacock and the "Argus" nomenclature are also prominent in a different myth, in which <a href="Io%20%28mythology%29">Io</a>, a beautiful princess of Argos, was lusted after by <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> (Jupiter). Zeus changed Io into a heifer to deceive his wife (and sister) <a href="Hera">Hera</a> and couple with her. Hera saw through Zeus's scheme and asked for the heifer as a gift. Zeus, unable to refuse such a reasonable request, reluctantly gave the heifer to Hera, who promptly banished Io and arranged for <a href="Argus%20Panoptes">Argus Panoptes</a>, a creature with one hundred eyes, to guard the now-pregnant Io from Zeus. Meanwhile, Zeus entreated <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> to save Io; Hermes used music to lull Argus Panoptes to sleep, then slew him. Hera adorned the tail of a peacock—her favorite bird—with Argus's eyes in his honor.

As recounted in <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>", the death of Argus Panoptes also contains an explicit celestial reference: ""Argus lay dead; so many eyes, so bright quenched, and all hundred shrouded in one night. Saturnia [Hera] retrieved those eyes to set in place among the feathers of her bird [the peacock, Pavo] and filled his tail with starry jewels.""

It is uncertain whether the Dutch astronomers had the Greek mythos in mind when creating Pavo but, in keeping with other constellations introduced by Plancius through Keyser and De Houtmann, the "peacock" in the new constellation likely referred to the <a href="Green%20peafowl">green peacock</a>, which the explorers would have encountered in the East Indies, rather than the <a href="blue%20peafowl">blue peacock</a> known to the ancient Greeks.

The <a href="Wardaman%20people">Wardaman people</a> of the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> in Australia saw the stars of Pavo and the neighbouring constellation <a href="Ara%20%28constellation%29">Ara</a> as flying foxes.

Pavo is bordered by <a href="Telescopium">Telescopium</a> to the north, <a href="Apus">Apus</a> and Ara to the west, <a href="Octans">Octans</a> to the south, and <a href="Indus%20%28constellation%29">Indus</a> to the east and northeast. Covering 378 square degrees, it ranks 44th of the 88 <a href="modern%20constellations">modern constellations</a> in size and covers 0.916% of the night sky. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is "Pav". The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −56.59° and −74.98°. As one of the deep southern constellations, it remains below the horizon at latitudes north of the <a href="30th%20parallel%20north">30th parallel</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, and is circumpolar at latitudes south of the <a href="50th%20parallel%20south">50th parallel</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>.

Although he depicted Pavo on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s. French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> labelled them Alpha to Omega in 1756, but omitted Psi and Xi, and labelled two pairs of stars close together Mu and Phi Pavonis. In 1879, American astronomer <a href="Benjamin%20Apthorp%20Gould">Benjamin Gould</a> designated a star Xi Pavonis as he felt its brightness warranted a name, but dropped Chi Pavonis due to its faintness.

Lying near the constellation's northern border with Telescopium is <a href="Alpha%20Pavonis">Alpha Pavonis</a>, the brightest star in Pavo. Its <a href="Stellar%20designation%23Proper%20names">proper name</a> — Peacock — is an English translation of the constellation's name. It was assigned by the British <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Nautical%20Almanac%20Office">Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office</a> in the late 1930s; the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> insisted that all bright stars must have names, the star hitherto having lacked a proper name. Alpha has an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent</a> (or visual) magnitude of 1.91 and <a href="Stellar%20classification">spectral type</a> B2IV. It is a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> system, one estimate placing the distance between the pair of stars as 0.21 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU), or half the distance between <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a> and the Sun. The two stars rotate around each other in a mere 11 days and 18 hours. The <a href="star%20system">star system</a> is located around 180 light years away from Earth.

With an apparent magnitude of 3.43, <a href="Beta%20Pavonis">Beta Pavonis</a> is the second-brightest star in the constellation. A white <a href="giant%20star">giant</a> of spectral class A7III, it is an aging star that has used up the hydrogen fuel at its core and has expanded and cooled after moving off the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a>. It lies 135 light years away from the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>.

Lying a few degrees west of Beta is <a href="Delta%20Pavonis">Delta Pavonis</a>, a nearby Sun-like but more <a href="stellar%20evolution">evolved</a> star; this is a yellow subgiant of spectral type G8IV and apparent magnitude 3.56 that is only 19.9 light years distant from Earth. East of Beta and at the constellation's eastern border with Indus is <a href="Gamma%20Pavonis">Gamma Pavonis</a>, a fainter, <a href="solar-type%20star">solar-type star</a> 30 light years from Earth with a magnitude of 4.22 and stellar class F9V. Other nearby stars in Pavo are much fainter: <a href="SCR%201845-6357">SCR 1845-6357</a> (the nearest star in Pavo) is a binary system with an apparent magnitude of 17.4 consisting of a <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> and <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> companion lying around 12.6 light years distant, while <a href="Gliese%20693">Gliese 693</a> is a red dwarf of magnitude 10.78 lying 19 light years away.

Pavo contains several variable stars of note. <a href="Lambda%20Pavonis">Lambda Pavonis</a> is a bright <a href="irregular%20variable">irregular variable</a> ranging between magnitudes 3.4 and 4.4; this variation can be observed with the unaided eye. Classed as a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable or <a href="shell%20star">shell star</a>, it is of spectral type B2II-IIIe and lies around 1430 light years distant from Earth. <a href="Kappa%20Pavonis">Kappa Pavonis</a> is a <a href="W%20Virginis%20variable">W Virginis variable</a>—a subclass of <a href="Type%20II%20Cepheid">Type II Cepheid</a>. It ranges from magnitude 3.91 to 4.78 over 9 days and is a yellow-white <a href="supergiant">supergiant</a> pulsating between spectral classes F5I-II and G5I-II. <a href="NU%20Pavonis">NU</a> and <a href="V%20Pavonis">V Pavonis</a> are pulsating <a href="semiregular%20variable%20star">semiregular variable</a> <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> stars. NU has a spectral type M6III and ranges from magnitude 4.9 to 5.3, while V Pavonis ranges from magnitude 6.3 to 8.2 over two periods of 225.4 and 3735 days concurrently. V is a <a href="carbon%20star">carbon star</a> of spectral type C6,4(Nb) with a prominent red hue.

Located in the west of the constellation and depicting the peacock's tail are <a href="Eta%20Pavonis">Eta</a> and <a href="Xi%20Pavonis">Xi Pavonis</a>. At apparent magnitude 3.6, Eta is a luminous orange giant of spectral type K2II some 350 light years distant from Earth. Xi Pavonis is a multiple star system visible in small telescopes as a brighter orange star and fainter white companion. Located around 470 light years from Earth, the system has a magnitude of 4.38. <a href="AR%20Pavonis">AR Pavonis</a> is a faint but well-studied <a href="Eclipsing%20binaries">eclipsing binary</a> composed of a red giant and smaller hotter star some 18000 light years from Earth. It has some features of a <a href="cataclysmic%20variable">cataclysmic variable</a>, the smaller component most likely having an <a href="accretion%20disc">accretion disc</a>. The visual magnitude ranges from 7.4 to 13.6 over 605 days.

In November 2018, the 8th magnitude star, <a href="HD%20186302">HD 186302</a> became the second star identified to be a solar sibling, this one being particularly sun like, same spectra G2, virtually the same mass as well, with a twin spectra revealing identical metalicity. 

The first star identified as a solar sibling in May 2014, <a href="HD%20162826">HD 162826</a>, within Hercules is an F type main sequence star somewhat more powerful than the Sun, with a mass 15% greater.

Six stars with <a href="planetary%20systems">planetary systems</a> have been found. Three planets have been discovered in the system of the orange star <a href="HD%20181433">HD 181433</a>, an inner super-earth with an orbital period of 9.4 days and two outer gas giants with periods of 2.6 and 6 years respectively. <a href="HD%20196050">HD 196050</a> and <a href="HD%20175167">HD 175167</a> are yellow G-class Sun-like stars, while <a href="HD%20190984">HD 190984</a> is an F-class main sequence star slightly larger and hotter than the Sun; all three are accompanied by a gas giant companion. <a href="HD%20172555">HD 172555</a> is a young white A-type main sequence star, two planets of which appear to have had a major collision in the past few thousand years. <a href="Spectrographic">Spectrographic</a> evidence of large amounts of <a href="silicon%20dioxide">silicon dioxide</a> gas indicates the smaller of the two, which had been at least the size of Earth's moon, was destroyed, and the larger, which was at least the size of Mercury, was severely damaged. Evidence of the collision was detected by NASA's <a href="Spitzer%20Space%20Telescope">Spitzer Space Telescope</a>. In the south of the constellation, <a href="Epsilon%20Pavonis">Epsilon Pavonis</a> is a 3.95-magnitude white main sequence star of spectral type A0Va located around 105 light years distant from Earth. It appears to be surrounded by a narrow ring of dust at a distance of 107 AU.

The <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a>s in Pavo include <a href="NGC%206752">NGC 6752</a>, the third-brightest <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a> in the sky, after <a href="47%20Tucanae">47 Tucanae</a> and <a href="Omega%20Centauri">Omega Centauri</a>. An estimated 100 light years across, it is thought to contain 100,000 stars. Lying three degrees to the south is <a href="NGC%206744">NGC 6744</a>, a <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> around 30 million light years away from Earth that resembles the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, but is twice its diameter. A <a href="Type%20Ib%20and%20Ic%20supernovae">type 1c supernova</a> was discovered in the galaxy in 2005; known as SN2005at, it peaked at magnitude 16.8. The dwarf galaxy <a href="IC%204662">IC 4662</a> lies 10 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc">arcminutes</a> northeast of Eta Pavonis, and is of magnitude 11.62. Located only 8 million light years away, it has several regions of <a href="Starburst%20region">high star formation</a>. The 14th-magnitude galaxy <a href="IC%204965">IC 4965</a> lies 1.7 degrees west of Alpha Pavonis, and is a central member of the <a href="Shapley%20Supercluster">Shapley Supercluster</a>.

Pavo is the <a href="radiant%20%28meteor%20shower%29">radiant</a> of two annual <a href="meteor%20showers">meteor showers</a>: the <a href="Delta%20Pavonids">Delta Pavonids</a> and <a href="August%20Pavonids">August Pavonids</a>. Appearing from 21 March to 8 April and generally peaking around 5 and 6 April, Delta Pavonids are thought to be associated with Comet Grigg-Mellish. The shower was discovered by Michael Buhagiar from Perth, Australia, who observed meteors on six occasions between 1969 and 1980. The August Pavonids peak around August 31 and are thought to be associated with the <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley</a>-type Comet Levy (P/1991 L3).

Willie wagtail

The willie (or willy) wagtail ("Rhipidura leucophrys") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a> native to <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, the <a href="Bismarck%20Archipelago">Bismarck Archipelago</a>, and Eastern <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. It is a common and familiar bird throughout much of its range, living in most habitats apart from thick forest. Measuring in length, the willie wagtail is contrastingly coloured with almost entirely black upperparts and white underparts; the male and female have similar plumage.

Three subspecies are recognised; "Rhipidura leucophrys leucophrys" from central and southern Australia, the smaller "R. l. picata" from northern Australia, and the larger "R. l. melaleuca" from New Guinea and islands in its vicinity. It is unrelated to the true wagtails of the genus "<a href="Motacilla">Motacilla</a>"; it is a member of the fantail genus "<a href="Rhipidura">Rhipidura</a>" and is a part of a "core corvine" group that includes true <a href="Corvidae">crows and ravens</a>, <a href="drongo">drongo</a>s and <a href="Bird-of-paradise">birds of paradise</a>. Within this group, fantails are placed either in the family <a href="Dicruridae">Dicruridae</a>, alongside drongos, or in their own small family, Rhipiduridae.

The willie wagtail is <a href="insectivore">insectivorous</a> and spends much time chasing prey in open <a href="habitat">habitat</a>. Its common name is derived from its habit of wagging its tail horizontally when foraging on the ground. Aggressive and territorial, the willie wagtail will often harass much larger birds such as the <a href="laughing%20kookaburra">laughing kookaburra</a> and <a href="wedge-tailed%20eagle">wedge-tailed eagle</a>. It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and is a common sight in urban lawns, parks, and gardens. It was widely featured in <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> <a href="folklore">folklore</a> around the country as either a bringer of bad news or a stealer of secrets.

The willie wagtail was first described by the English ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in 1801 as "<a href="Turdus">Turdus</a> leucophrys". Its specific epithet is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "leukos" "white" and "ǒphrys" "eyebrow". Other early scientific names include "<a href="Muscicapa">Muscicapa</a> tricolor" by <a href="Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Vieillot</a>, and "Rhipidura motacilloides" by naturalists <a href="Nicholas%20Aylward%20Vigors">Nicholas Aylward Vigors</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Horsfield">Thomas Horsfield</a> in 1827, who erected the genus "Rhipidura". The generic term is derived from the Ancient Greek "rhipis" "fan" and "oura" "tail".

<a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> and other early writers referred to the species as the black-and-white fantail, although did note the current name. However, "willie wagtail" rapidly became widely accepted sometime after 1916. "Wagtail" is derived from its active behaviour, while the origins of "willie" are obscure. The name had been in use colloquially for the pied subspecies of the <a href="white%20wagtail">white wagtail</a> ("Motacilla alba") on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, and <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.

Other vernacular names applied include shepherd's companion (because it accompanied <a href="livestock">livestock</a>), frogbird, morning bird, and Australian nightingale. Many Aboriginal names are <a href="Onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a>, based on the sound of its scolding call. "Djididjidi" is a name from the Kimberley, and ' is used by the <a href="Gunwinggu">Gunwinggu</a> of western <a href="Arnhem%20Land">Arnhem Land</a>. In <a href="Central%20Australia">Central Australia</a>, southwest of <a href="Alice%20Springs">Alice Springs</a>, the <a href="Pitjantjatjara%20language">Pitjantjatjara</a> word is '. Among the <a href="Kamilaroi">Kamilaroi</a>, it is '. In Bougainville Island, it is called ' in the <a href="Piva-Banoni%20languages">Banoni</a> language from the west coast, and in Awaipa of Kieta district it is '. In the Solomon Islands Pijin it is sometimes called the ' (police) or "" (priest) bird, because of its black-and-white colouring.

The willie wagtail is unrelated to the <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>n <a href="wagtail">wagtail</a>s of the family <a href="Motacillidae">Motacillidae</a>. It is one of 47 members of the <a href="fantail">fantail</a> genus "<a href="Rhipidura">Rhipidura</a>"; some authorities classify this group of birds as a subfamily Rhipidurinae within the drongo family <a href="Dicruridae">Dicruridae</a>, together with the <a href="monarch%20flycatcher">monarch flycatcher</a>s, while others consider them distinct enough to warrant their own family <a href="Rhipiduridae">Rhipiduridae</a>. Early molecular research in the late 1980s and early 1990s revealed that the fantails belong to a large group of mainly Australasian birds known as the <a href="parvorder">parvorder</a> <a href="Corvida">Corvida</a> comprising many tropical and Australian passerines. More recently, the grouping has been refined somewhat and the fantails have been classified in a "core corvine" group with the <a href="Corvidae">crows and ravens</a>, <a href="shrikes">shrikes</a>, <a href="Bird-of-paradise">birds of paradise</a>, <a href="monarch%20flycatcher">monarch flycatcher</a>s, <a href="drongo">drongo</a>s and <a href="Corcoracidae">mudnest builders</a>.

The following three subspecies are widely recognised:

An adult willie wagtail is between in length and weighs 17–24 <a href="gram">g</a> (0.6–0.85 <a href="ounce">oz</a>), with a tail 10–11 cm (approx 4 in) long. The short, slender bill measures 1.64–1.93 cm (around 0.75 in), and is tipped with a small hook. This species has longer legs than other fantails, which may be an adaptation to foraging on the ground. The male and female have similar <a href="plumage">plumage</a>; the head, throat, upper breast, wings, upperparts, and tail are all black, with a white eyebrow, "whiskers" and underparts. The <a href="beak">bill</a> and legs are black and the <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> dark brown. Immature birds in their first year after moulting from juvenile plumage may have pale tips in their wings, while juvenile birds themselves have duller plumage, their upperparts brown-tinged with some pale brown scallops on the head and breast.

The wagtail is very "chatty" and has a number of distinct vocalisations. Its most-recognised sound is its alarm call which is a rapid "chit-chit-chit-chit", although it has more melodious sounds in its repertoire. The alarm call is sounded to warn off potential rivals and threats from its territory and also seems to serve as a signal to its mate when a potential threat is in the area. John Gould reported that it sounded like a child's rattle or "small cog-wheels of a steam mill". In his book "What Bird is That?" (1935), <a href="Neville%20William%20Cayley">Neville Cayley</a> writes that it has "a pleasant call resembling "sweet pretty little creature", frequently uttered during the day or night, especially on moonlight nights".

Widespread and abundant, the willie wagtail is found across most of Australia and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, the <a href="Bismarck%20Archipelago">Bismarck Archipelago</a>, and eastern <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. It is sedentary across most of Australia, though some areas have recorded seasonal movements; it is an autumn and winter visitor to northeastern New South Wales and southeast Queensland, as well as the <a href="Gulf%20Country">Gulf Country</a> and parts of <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> in the far north. It is a vagrant to Tasmania, and on occasion reaches <a href="Lord%20Howe%20Island">Lord Howe Island</a>. There is one record from <a href="Mangere%20Island">Mangere Island</a> in the Chatham Islands archipelago east of <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> in 2002. The willie wagtail was released in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> around 1922 to control insects on livestock, but the introduction was unsuccessful and the last sighting was at <a href="Koko%20Head">Koko Head</a> in 1937.

The willie wagtail is at home in a wide variety of habitats, but avoids densely forested areas such as rainforest. It prefers semi-open woodland or grassland with scattered trees, often near wetlands or bodies of water. In New Guinea, it inhabits man-made clearings and grasslands, as well as open forest and mangroves. On <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>, it was reported from open areas and coconut groves. It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and can often be seen hunting in open, grassed areas such as lawns, gardens, parkland, and sporting grounds. The species spread into the Western Australian <a href="Wheatbelt%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Wheatbelt</a> after the original vegetation had been cleared for agriculture.

The willie wagtail is almost always on the move and rarely still for more than a few moments during daylight hours. Even while perching it will flick its tail from side to side, twisting about looking for prey. Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs, although they may gather in small flocks. Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground. It beats its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.

The willie wagtail is highly <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> and can be quite fearless in defence of its territory; it will harry not only small birds but also much larger species such as the <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a> ("Gymnorhina tibicen"), <a href="Australian%20raven">raven</a> ("Corvus coronoides"), <a href="laughing%20kookaburra">laughing kookaburra</a> ("Dacelo novaeguineae"), or <a href="wedge-tailed%20eagle">wedge-tailed eagle</a> ("Aquila audax"). It may even attack domestic dogs, cats and humans which approach its nest too closely. It has also been observed harassing snake-neck turtles and tiger snakes in Western Australia. When harassing an opponent, the willie wagtail avoids the head and aims for the rear. Both the male and female may engage in this behaviour, and generally more intensely in the breeding season. Territories range from in area. A pair of birds will declare and defend their territory against other pairs in a "diving display". One bird remains still while the other loops and dives repeatedly before the roles are reversed; both sing all the while.

The willie wagtail has more than 'responded well to human alteration'. It has been seen to seek out the company of individual humans, following and "chatting". Calling out to a human who is inside a house, following (and chatting) at quite some distance from the nest is not aggressive or protective.

The bird's white eyebrows become flared and more prominent in an "aggressive display", and settled and more hidden when in a submissive or "appeasement display".

Willie wagtails usually pair for life. The breeding season lasts from July to December, more often occurring after rain in drier regions. Anywhere up to four <a href="brooding">broods</a> may be raised during this time. It builds a <a href="cup%20nest">cup-like nest</a> on a tree branch away from leaves or cover, less than above the ground. <a href="Rafter">Rafter</a>s and <a href="eaves">eaves</a> may also be used. It has been observed to build its nest in the vicinity of those of the <a href="magpie-lark">magpie-lark</a> ("Grallina cyanoleuca"), possibly taking advantage of the latter bird's territoriality and aggression toward intruders. Similarly, it is not afraid to build near human habitation.

The nest consists of grass stems, strips of <a href="Bark%20%28botany%29">bark</a>, and other fibrous material which is bound and woven together with <a href="spider%20web">spider web</a>. Even hair from pet dogs and cats may be used. It has also been observed attempting to take hair from a pet goat. An alpaca breeder in the Mudgee District of New South Wales has observed alpaca fleece in the nests of willy wagtails (the results of scraps of fleece not picked up at shearing time). The female lays two to four small cream-white <a href="bird%20egg">eggs</a> with brownish markings measuring , and <a href="avian%20incubation">incubates</a> them for 14 days. Like all <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, the chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a> and <a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a>; they are born naked and helpless with closed eyes, and remain in the nest. Both parents take part in feeding the young, and may continue to do so while embarking on another brood. Nestlings remain in the nest for around 14 days before fledging. Upon leaving, the fledglings will remain hidden in cover nearby for one or two days before venturing further afield, up to away by the third day. Parents will stop feeding their fledglings near the end of the second week, as the young birds increasingly forage for themselves, and soon afterwards drive them out of the territory.

The female <a href="pallid%20cuckoo">pallid cuckoo</a> ("Cuculus pallidus") will lay eggs in a willie wagtail <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a>, although the hosts often recognise and eject the foreign eggs, so successful <a href="brood%20parasitism">brood parasitism</a> is rare. Parasitism by the <a href="Fan-tailed%20cuckoo">fan-tailed</a> ("Cacomantis flabelliformis"), <a href="brush%20cuckoo">brush</a>, ("C. variolosus"), <a href="Horsfield%27s%20bronze%20cuckoo">Horsfield's bronze</a> ("Chrysococcyx basalis"), and <a href="shining%20bronze%20cuckoo">shining bronze cuckoo</a> ("C. lucidus") has also been reported.

Although the willie wagtail is an aggressive defender of its nest, <a href="predation">predators</a> do account for many eggs and young. About two thirds of eggs hatch successfully, and a third leave the nest as fledglings. Nestlings may be preyed upon by both <a href="pied%20butcherbird">pied butcherbird</a>s, ("Cracticus nigrogularis") <a href="black%20butcherbird">black butcherbird</a>s ("C. quoyi"), the <a href="spangled%20drongo">spangled drongo</a> ("Dicrurus bracteatus"), and the <a href="pied%20currawong">pied currawong</a> ("Strepera graculina"), as well as the <a href="feral%20cat">feral cat</a> ("Felis catus"), and <a href="Rattus">rat</a> species. The proximity of nesting to human habitation has also left nests open to destruction by children.

The willie wagtail perches on low branches, fences, posts, and the like, watching for insects and other small <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s in the air or on the ground. It usually hunts by <a href="hawking%20%28birds%29">hawking</a> flying insects such as <a href="gnat">gnat</a>s, flies, and small moths, but will occasionally <a href="gleaning%20%28birds%29">glean</a> from the ground. It will often hop along the ground and flit behind people and animals, such as cattle, sheep or horses, as they walk over grassed areas, to catch any creatures disturbed by their passing. It wags its tail in a horizontal fashion while foraging in this manner; the exact purpose of this behaviour is unknown but is thought to help flush out insects hidden in vegetation and hence make them easier to catch. The willie wagtail takes ticks from the skin of <a href="grazing">grazing</a> animals such as cattle or pigs, even from lions asleep in a zoo. It kills its prey by bashing it against a hard surface, or holding it and pulling off the wings before extracting the edible insides.

The adaptability and opportunistic diet of the willie wagtail have probably assisted it in adapting to human habitation; it eats a wide variety of <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s, including <a href="butterflies">butterflies</a>, <a href="moth">moth</a>s, <a href="flies">flies</a>, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, <a href="dragonflies">dragonflies</a>, <a href="Hemiptera">bugs</a>, <a href="spider">spider</a>s, <a href="centipede">centipede</a>s, and <a href="millipede">millipede</a>s, and has been recorded killing small lizards such as <a href="skinks">skinks</a> and <a href="gecko">gecko</a>s in a study in <a href="Madang">Madang</a> on Papua New Guinea's north coast. The tailbones of these lizards have been found in their <a href="faeces">faeces</a> although it is unclear whether the whole animal was eaten or merely the tail. Either way, lizards are only a very occasional prey item forming between 1 and 3% of the total diet. Evidence from the study in Madang suggested that the willie wagtail selectively fed nestlings larger prey.

The willie wagtail was a feature in <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Australian Aboriginal</a> <a href="folklore">folklore</a>. Aboriginal tribes in parts of southeastern Australia, such as the <a href="Ngarrindjeri">Ngarrindjeri</a> of the Lower <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a>, and the Narrunga People of the <a href="Yorke%20Peninsula">Yorke Peninsula</a>, regard the willie wagtail as the bearer of bad news. It was thought that the willie wagtail could steal a person's secrets while lingering around camps eavesdropping, so women would be tight-lipped in the presence of the bird. The people of the Kimberley held a similar belief that it would inform the spirit of the recently departed if living relatives spoke badly of them. They also venerated the willie wagtail as the most intelligent of all animals. Its cleverness is also seen in a <a href="Saposa-Tinputz%20languages">Tinputz</a> tale of Bougainville Island, where "Singsing Tongereng" (Willie Wagtail) wins a contest among all birds to see who can fly the highest, by riding on the back of the eagle. However, the Gunwinggu in western Arnhem Land took a dimmer view and regarded it as a liar and a <a href="wikt%3Atattletale">tattletale</a>. The willie wagtail was held to have stolen fire and tried to extinguish it in the sea in a <a href="Dreaming%20%28spirituality%29">dreaming</a> story of the <a href="Yinjibarndi%20language">Yindjibarndi</a> people of the central and western <a href="Pilbara">Pilbara</a>, and was able to send a strong wind if frightened. In the <a href="Noongar">Noongar</a> language dialects, the willie wagtail is known as the "Djiti-Djiti(pronounced Chitti-chitti)" and the "Willaring" in the <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a> region.

The <a href="Kalam%20%28tribe%29">Kalam</a> people of New Guinea highlands called it "konmayd", and deemed it a good bird; if it came and chattered when a new garden was tilled, then there would be good crops. It is said to be taking care of pigs if it is darting and calling around them. It may also be the manifestation of the ghost of paternal relatives to the Kalam. Called the "kuritoro" bird in New Guinea's eastern highlands, its appearance was significant in the mourning ceremony by a widow for her dead husband. She would offer him banana flowers; the presence of the bird singing nearby would confirm that the dead man's soul had taken the offering.

A tale from the Kieta district of Bougainville Island relates that a "maneka", the willie wagtail, darting along a river bank echoes a legendary daughter looking for her mother who drowned trying to cross a flooding river in a storm. The bird has been depicted on postage stamps in <a href="Palau">Palau</a> and the Solomon Islands, and has also appeared as a character in Australian children's literature, such as "<a href="Dot%20and%20the%20Kangaroo">Dot and the Kangaroo</a>" (1899), "<a href="Blinky%20Bill">Blinky Bill Grows Up</a>" (1935), and "Willie Wagtail and Other Tales" (1929).

God Hates Us All

God Hates Us All is the ninth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> band <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a>, released on September 11, 2001 by <a href="American%20Recordings%20%28US%29">American Recordings</a>. It was recorded over three months at <a href="The%20Warehouse%20Studio">The Warehouse Studio</a> in Vancouver, and includes the <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>-nominated "Disciple". Guitarist <a href="Kerry%20King">Kerry King</a> wrote the majority of its lyrics, taking a different approach from earlier recordings by exploring topics such as religion, murder, revenge, and self-control. The band experimented, recording most of the album in C# tuning, with three songs in <a href="Drop%20B%20tuning">drop B</a> and two others with <a href="seven-string%20guitar">seven-string guitar</a>s in B♭.

The album's release was delayed due to its explicit cover artwork, which led to alternative slip covers in some retail outlets, difficulties during mixing, and a change of <a href="Distribution%20%28business%29">distributor</a> for the band's label. Despite this, "God Hates Us All" received positive reviews from critics and peaked at number 28 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>.

Slayer began writing lyrics for a new album prior to their appearance at the 1999 <a href="Ozzfest">Ozzfest</a>. However, every three to four months the band was distracted by commitments to Ozzfest, and worldwide "<a href="Tattoo%20the%20Earth">Tattoo the Earth</a>" tour with <a href="Slipknot%20%28band%29">Slipknot</a>. Guitarist <a href="Jeff%20Hanneman">Jeff Hanneman</a> later admitted "that was the last break. Then we got our shit together." The band's longtime producer, <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a>, was too busy to work with Slayer, and felt "burned out"—unable to create intense music. Araya and King had similar feelings about Rubin, and King remarked he "wanted to work with someone into the heavy-music scene, and Rubin's not anymore. I wanted somebody who knows what's hot, knows what's selling, knows the new techniques, and will keep me on my toes." Rubin recommended two producers, although the first producer was not going to work out personality-wise according to Hanneman. The band gave second candidate, <a href="Matt%20Hyde">Matt Hyde</a>, a trial on the song "Bloodline", which appeared in the movie "<a href="Dracula%202000">Dracula 2000</a>". The band was pleased with Hyde's work on "Bloodline" and hired him to produce the entire album.

"God Hates Us All" was to be recorded in a <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> studio; however, the band relocated to <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, British Columbia due to the availability of cheaper studio time. Hyde recommended a studio to the band—<a href="The%20Warehouse%20Studio">The Warehouse Studio</a> (owned by <a href="Bryan%20Adams">Bryan Adams</a>) as he had previously worked there. The studio was altered to make it "feel like home" for Slayer; as opposed to the setting for, in King's words, the "lightweight Canadian pop singer". This consisted of adding <a href="incense">incense</a> burners, candles, dimmed lights and <a href="pornography">pornography</a> on the walls. Two banner flags of two middle fingers were also hung up. Vocalist <a href="Tom%20Araya">Tom Araya</a> says "that was basically the attitude of Slayer in the studio. We had a red devil head on one of the speakers. We had a skull on another. That's the kind of shit we put up. Spooky stuff that makes you feel at home."

Hyde used the <a href="digital%20audio%20workstation">digital audio workstation</a> <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a> during the <a href="sound%20engineer">engineering</a>, <a href="Record%20producer">production</a>, and <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">audio mixing</a> stages of the album. Slayer members wanted to keep the use of computer effects to a minimum, only to include a small amount of <a href="Delay%20%28audio%20effect%29">delay</a> and <a href="distortion">distortion</a>. As with previous recordings, the drum tracks were recorded first. Drummer <a href="Paul%20Bostaph">Paul Bostaph</a> follows a simple rule suggested by Rubin when in the studio: "The perfect take is the one that felt like it was going to fall apart but never did." <a href="Seven-string%20guitar">Seven-string guitar</a>s were used on the tracks "Scarstruck" and "Here Comes the Pain," the first time Slayer had done so. King was at the <a href="B.C.%20Rich">B.C. Rich</a> guitar company (manufacturer of his signature model, the <a href="KKV%20guitar">KKV</a>) and decided to borrow a seven string guitar. After writing one song, King ordered a seven string as he thought "there's no point having one tuning for just one song," so he wrote another, going on to comment "you don't have to be good to make up a seven-string riff." The album features two songs on seven string guitars, four songs with guitars tuned to Drop-B and all other songs in C# Standard.

"God Hates Us All" explores such themes as religion, murder, revenge, and <a href="self-control">self-control</a>. King wrote a majority of the lyrics, which he based on "street" subjects which everyone could relate to, rather than "<a href="Satan">Satan</a> this," "Satan that," and "the usual <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a> shit" from the band's previous records. King told "<a href="Guitar%20World">Guitar World</a>":

The song "Threshold" is about reaching one's limit with a person in a situation where one is about to break—and are about to blow up as they get "under your skin", while "Cast Down" features a fallen angel who falls into drugs. "God Send Death" and "Deviance" take up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman. Having read several books on <a href="serial%20killers">serial killers</a>, Hanneman came to the conclusion he could only kill someone if they really "pissed him off", and decided he was unable to kill someone he did not know just for power. He later admitted he was trying to get into that person's mind; "why do they get off on it? Without being angry, just killing for the sake of killing and getting off on it. I just wanted to get into that mindset."

While other members went to local pubs, Araya spent his free hours reading factual books regarding serial killers, including <a href="Gordon%20Burn">Gordon Burn</a>'s "Happy Like Murderers: The Story of Fred and Rosemary West". Araya was seeking inspiration, and aimed to sound convincing while singing the lyrics, avoiding himself to sound like a gimmick. Araya sang the lyrics more "over-the-top" than done on previous albums, as King's writing style is more "aggro." This resulted in "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" reviewer Jason Arnopp describing the album's lyrics as "so packed with foul and abusive language that it sounds as if <a href="D12%20%28band%29">D-12</a> and <a href="the%20Sopranos">the Sopranos</a> family were going head-to-head in a celebrity swearathon."

"God Hates Us All" was originally intended to be named "Soundtrack to the Apocalypse". However, Araya suggested that the title would be better used for a <a href="box%20set">box set</a>, which the band <a href="Soundtrack%20to%20the%20Apocalypse">released</a> in 2003. The phrase "God Hates Us All" originates from the song "Disciple", during which the line is repeated over the chorus. The lyrics are in reference to God's allowance of acts such as suicide and terrorism, while seemingly doing nothing to prevent them (see <a href="problem%20of%20evil">problem of evil</a>). A member of the heavy metal band <a href="Pantera">Pantera</a> suggested using "God Hates Us All" for a shirt design after King played the song to the band. King agreed, although he thought the phrase would have more impact as the album title.

The original album cover depicts a <a href="Bible">Bible</a> spiked with nails placed in a <a href="pentagram">pentagram</a> star shape, covered in blood with the word "Slayer" burnt across it. The <a href="liner%20notes">liner notes</a> intersperse the lyrics between passages from the biblical <a href="Book%20of%20Job">Book of Job</a>, partly crossed out with a black marker. The idea was suggested by the band's record company, although King wanted more time to develop a better cover. King's concept for the cover was to show nails in the shape of a pentagram, and have them miss keywords in Bible verses so it appeared as if it had been created by a <a href="Psychopathy%23Sociopathy">sociopath</a> who knew where every word appears. He later complained that the outcome was typical of "a record company with absolutely no idea what the fuck they were going to do", and said that the cover "looked like a seventh grader defaced the Bible." A <a href="Slipcase">slip insert</a> was placed in front of the covers in major retail outlets.

"God Hates Us All" was set for release on July 10; however, concerns regarding <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">audio mixing</a>, the album cover, and the band's label—<a href="American%20Recordings%20%28record%20label%29">American Recordings</a>—changing <a href="Distribution%20%28business%29">distributor</a>, caused the release date to be delayed until September 11, 2001. The release drew a connection to the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, which was the second time Slayer caused controversy towards one of their releases—the video for "Seasons in the Abyss" was filmed in Egypt and released prior to the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. In its week of release, "God Hates Us All" debuted at number 28 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, and sold 51,000 copies. It entered the <a href="Canadian%20Albums%20Chart">Canadian Albums Chart</a> at number 9, and debuted at number 18 on the top Internet album chart. As of August 16, 2006, the album has sold 304,000 copies in the United States.

"God Hates us All" received generally positive reviews from music critics. On <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, the album has a score of 80 out of 100 based on 12 reviews. "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" Jason Arnopp described the album as "easily Slayer's most convincing collection since "Seasons in the Abyss"," awarding the album five out of five. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" Rob Kemp wrote the record was "Slayer's most brutal record since 1986's immortal (or undead) "Reign in Blood"," describing the music as "galloping <a href="double-bass">double-bass</a>-drum salvos" which "switch on a dime to furious double-time pummeling, as ominous <a href="power%20chords">power chords</a> and jagged shred solos slice and dice with <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> precision." Kemp awarded the album three and a half out of five. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> reviewer Jason Birchmeier commented that "nearly 20 years into their evolution, Slayer have abandoned the extravagancies and accessibility of their late-'80s/early-'90s work and returned to perfect the raw approach of their early years. A near flawless album," and that Araya's performance possibly makes "the most exhausting Slayer album yet."

Not all critics were impressed with the album. <a href="Blabbermouth.net">Blabbermouth.net</a> reviewer Borivoj Krgin dismissively labeled the album as "another failure on the band's part to take the initiative and reinvent themselves." Krgin described King as "the weaker and less inventive of the two main songwriters" (King and Hanneman), feeling the album followed "a familiar direction that almost always sounds tired and forced" as a result of King being the album's main songwriter. Krgin also singled out Araya for criticism, and called the vocalist a "hollow shell of his former self, boasting a singing style that is monotonous, devoid of creativity and at times virtually unlistenable." Krgin awarded the record 6 out of 10, and ended the review by observing that "Slayer's rapidly diminishing record sales ("Diabolus In Musica" has shifted less than 300,000 copies in the US compared to 600–700,000+) as a sign that the band is in dire need of a new lease on life." "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" gave it a mixed review, stating, "Of course, what Slayer says isn't supposed to be nearly as important as how it says it: The riffs are all overdriven and suffocating, and that's a conscious decision. In its simplest form, a song like "Exile" could pass for Motorhead pushed through the blades of a lawn mower, but that's selling Slayer short; guitarist Kerry King actively fights the groove that naturally comes from playing heavy rock-and-roll."

The song "Disciple" received a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> nomination for "<a href="Best%20Metal%20Performance">Best Metal Performance</a>" at the <a href="44th%20Grammy%20Awards">44th Grammy Awards</a>, the band's first nomination. The members cared neither about the nomination nor the award ceremony, and although they did not expect to win, thought it was "cool" to be nominated. The ceremony took place on February 27, 2002, with <a href="Tool%20%28band%29">Tool</a> winning the award for their song "<a href="Schism%20%28song%29">Schism</a>".

Prior to Christmas 2001, Bostaph sustained a chronic elbow injury which hindered his ability to drum, resulting in his decision to leave the band. His third-to-last performance with Slayer was recorded on "<a href="War%20at%20the%20Warfield">War at the Warfield</a>". To date, Bostaph has not viewed the footage; he has likened the experience to "breaking up with a girlfriend," and wants to move on with his life. Bostaph does not regret his time spent with the band, and described the period as a high point in his career. Bostaph eventually rejoined Slayer in 2013, once again replacing Dave Lombardo. Without a drummer the band were unable to finish their "God Hates Us All" tour. King contacted original drummer <a href="Dave%20Lombardo">Dave Lombardo</a> almost ten years after his departure, and asked him if he would be willing to play for the remainder of the tour. Lombardo accepted the offer, and played for the remaining 21 shows; however, he did not take on a permanent position with the band.

Following the tour, the band continued their search for a permanent drummer, and sought solicitation via demo tape and <a href="snail%20mail">snail mail</a>. Interested fans sent video recordings of renditions of the songs "Disciple," "God Send Death," "Stain of Mind," "<a href="Angel%20of%20Death%20%28Slayer%20song%29">Angel of Death</a>", "Postmortem/<a href="Raining%20Blood">Raining Blood</a>," "South of Heaven," "War Ensemble," and "Seasons in the Abyss"; complete with résumés. The band listened to hundreds of demo tapes, and created a "good pile" and "ungood pile," though the "ungood" was much larger. Those whose performances the band were pleased with were offered an audition in Dallas, San Francisco or Peoria, Illinois; many applicants, however, were unable to attend due to flight costs. The band auditioned roughly two to three drummers a day, and their top choice was one of Lombardo's recommendations. However, the band ultimately returned to Lombardo after deciding that they could not find a drummer who suited the job; Lombardo re-joined Slayer and attended music festivals worldwide to promote "God Hates Us All" and record drums on the 2006 album "<a href="Christ%20Illusion">Christ Illusion</a>".

The Country Wife

The Country Wife is a <a href="Restoration%20comedy">Restoration comedy</a> written in 1675 by <a href="William%20Wycherley">William Wycherley</a>. A product of the tolerant early <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a> period, the play reflects an <a href="aristocracy">aristocratic</a> and anti-<a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> ideology, and was controversial for its sexual explicitness even in its own time. The title itself contains a lewd pun with regard to the first syllable of "country". It is based on several plays by <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a>, with added features that 1670s London audiences demanded: <a href="colloquialism">colloquial</a> <a href="prose">prose</a> <a href="dialogue">dialogue</a> in place of Molière's <a href="Poetry">verse</a>, a complicated, fast-paced plot tangle, and many sex jokes. It turns on two indelicate plot devices: a <a href="rake%20%28character%29">rake</a>'s trick of pretending near <a href="impotence">impotence</a> to safely have clandestine affairs with married women, and the arrival in London of an inexperienced young "country wife", with her discovery of the joys of town life, especially the fascinating London men.
The implied condition the Rake, Horner, claimed to suffer from was, he said, contracted in France whilst "dealing with common women". The only cure was to have a surgeon drastically reduce the extent of his manly stature and therefore he would be no threat to any man's wife.

The scandalous trick and the frank language have for much of the play's history kept it off the stage and out of print. Between 1753 and 1924, "The Country Wife" was considered too outrageous to be performed at all and was replaced on the stage by <a href="David%20Garrick">David Garrick</a>'s cleaned-up and bland version "<a href="The%20Country%20Girl%20%281766%20play%29">The Country Girl</a>", now a forgotten curiosity. The original play is again a stage favourite today, and is also acclaimed by <a href="academia">academic</a> critics, who praise its linguistic energy, sharp social satire, and openness to different interpretations.

After the 18-year <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> stage ban was lifted at the <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a> of the monarchy in 1660, the theatrical life of London recreated itself quickly and abundantly. During the reign of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> (1660–1685), playwrights such as <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a>, <a href="George%20Etherege">George Etherege</a>, <a href="Aphra%20Behn">Aphra Behn</a>, and William Wycherley wrote comedies that triumphantly reassert aristocratic dominance and prestige after the years of middle class power during <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth</a>. Reflecting the atmosphere of the <a href="Noble%20court">Court</a>, these plays celebrate a lifestyle of sensual intrigue and conquest, especially conquest that served to humiliate the husbands of the London middle classes and to avenge, in the sensual arena, the marginalisation and exile suffered by <a href="Cavalier">royalists</a> under Cromwell. Charles' personal interest in the stage nourished Restoration drama, and his most favoured <a href="courtier">courtier</a>s were poets, playwrights, and men of wit, such as <a href="John%20Wilmot%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Rochester">John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester</a>, <a href="Charles%20Sackville%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Dorset">Charles Sackville, Earl of Dorset</a>, and William Wycherley. Wycherley had no title or wealth, but had by 1675 already recommended himself by two well-received comedies and had been admitted to the inner circle, sharing the conversation and sometimes the <a href="Mistress%20%28lover%29">mistresses</a> of Charles, who "was extremely fond of him upon account of his wit". In 1675, at age 35, he created a sensation with "The Country Wife", greeted as the bawdiest and wittiest play yet seen on the English stage.

Like Charles II, Wycherley had spent some Commonwealth years in France and become interested in French drama, and throughout his short playwriting career (1671–1676) he would borrow plotlines and techniques from French plays, particularly <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a>. However, in contrast to the French, English audiences of the 1670s had no enthusiasm for structurally simple comedies or for the <a href="neoclassicism">neoclassical</a> <a href="classical%20unities">unities of time, place, and action</a>, but demanded fast pace, many complications, and above all "variety". To achieve the much denser texture and more complex plotting that pleased in London, Wycherley would combine several source plays to produce bustling action and clashing moods, ranging from <a href="farce">farce</a> through <a href="paradox">paradox</a> to satire.

A Restoration novelty of which Wycherley took advantage was the readiness of public opinion to accept women on stage, for the first time in British history. Audiences were fascinated to see real women reverse the <a href="cross-dressing">cross-dressing</a> of the Elizabethan boy actors and appear in tight-fitting male outfits in the popular <a href="breeches%20role">breeches role</a>s, and to hear them match or even outdo the <a href="rake%20%28character%29">rake</a> heroes in <a href="repartee">repartee</a> and <a href="double%20entendre">double entendre</a>. Charles' choice of actresses as mistresses, notably <a href="Nell%20Gwyn">Nell Gwyn</a>, helped keep the interest fresh, and Wycherley plays on this interest in "The Country Wife" by having Mr. Pinchwife disguise his wife (the eponymous 'country wife') in a boy's outfit. It has also been suggested that he uses the allure of women on display to emphasise in an almost <a href="voyeurism">voyeuristic</a> way Margery's provocative innocence, as well as the immodest knowingness of "town" wives like Lady Fidget.

"The Country Wife" is more neatly constructed than most Restoration comedies, but is typical of its time and place in having three sources and three plots. The separate plots are interlinked but distinct, each projecting a sharply different mood. They may be schematised as Horner's <a href="impotence">impotence</a> trick, the married life of Pinchwife and Margery, and the courtship of Harcourt and Alithea.

1. Horner's impotence trick provides the play's organising principle and the turning-points of the action. The trick, to pretend impotence to be allowed where no complete man may go, is (distantly) based on the classic <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> comedy "Eunuchus" by <a href="Terence">Terence</a>. The upper-class town rake Harry Horner begins a campaign for seducing as many respectable ladies as possible and thus <a href="cuckold">cuckold</a>ing or "putting horns on" their husbands: Horner's name serves to alert the audience to what is going on. He spreads a false rumour of his own impotence, to convince married men that he can safely be allowed to socialise with their wives. The rumour is also meant to assist his mass seduction campaign by helping him identify women who are secretly eager for extramarital sex, because those women will react to a supposedly impotent man with tell-tale horror and disgust. This diagnostic trick, which invariably works perfectly, is one of "The Country Wife"'s many running jokes at the expense of hypocritical upper-class women who are rakes at heart.

Horner's ruse of impotence is a great success, and he has sex with many ladies of virtuous reputation, mostly the wives and daughters of citizens or "cits", i.e. upwardly mobile businessmen and entrepreneurs of the City of London, as opposed to the Town, the aristocratic quarters where Horner and his friends live. Three such ladies appear on stage, usually together: Lady Fidget, her sister-in-law Mrs Dainty Fidget, and her tag-along friend Mrs Squeamish names that convey both a delicate sensitivity about the jewel of reputation, and a certain fidgety physical unease or tickle and the dialogue gives an indefinite impression of many more. The play is structured as a farce, driven by Horner's secret and by a succession of near-discoveries of the truth, from which he extricates himself by aplomb and good luck. A final hair-raising threat of exposure comes in the last scene, through the well-meaning frankness of the young country wife Margery Pinchwife. Margery is indignant at the accusations of impotence directed at "poor dear Mr. Horner", which she knows from personal experience to be untrue, and is intent on saying so at the traditional end-of-the-play public gathering of the entire cast. In a final <a href="trickster">trickster</a> masterpiece, Horner averts the danger, joining forces with his more sophisticated lovers to persuade the jealous Pinchwife to at least pretend to believe Horner impotent and his own wife still innocent. Horner never becomes a reformed character but is assumed to go on reaping the fruits of his planted misinformation, past the last act and beyond.
2. The married life of Pinchwife and Margery is based on <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a>'s "School For Husbands" (1661) and "School For Wives" (1662). Pinchwife is a middle-aged man who has married a naive country girl in the hope that she will not know to cuckold him. However, Horner teaches her, and Margery cuts a swath through the complexities of London <a href="Upper%20class">upper-class</a> marriage and seduction without even noticing them. Restoration comedies often contrast town and country for humorous effect, and this is one example of it. Both Molière in the "School For Wives" and Wycherley in "The Country Wife" get much comic business out of the meeting between, on the one hand, innocent but inquisitive young girls and, on the other hand, the sophisticated 17th-century culture of sexual relations which they encounter. The difference, which would later make Molière acceptable and Wycherley atrocious to 19th-century critics and theatre producers, is that Molière's Agnes is naturally pure and virtuous, while Margery is just the opposite: enthusiastic about the virile handsomeness of town gallants, rakes, and especially theatre actors, she keeps Pinchwife in a state of continual horror with her plain-spokenness and her interest in sex. A running joke is the way Pinchwife's <a href="pathological%20jealousy">pathological jealousy</a> always leads him into supplying Margery with the very type of information he wishes her not to have.

3. The courtship of Harcourt and Alithea is a conventional love story without any direct source. By means of persistence and true love, the witty Harcourt, Horner's friend, wins the hand of Pinchwife's sister Alithea, who is, when the play opens, engaged to the shallow <a href="fop">fop</a> Sparkish. The delay mechanism of this story is that the upright Alithea holds fast virtuously to her engagement to Sparkish, even while his stupid and cynical character unfolds to her. It is only after Alithea has been caught in a misleadingly compromising situation with Horner, and Sparkish has doubted her virtue while Harcourt has not, that she finally admits her love for Harcourt.

Notorious scenes in the play include "the china scene", a sustained <a href="double%20entendre">double entendre</a> <a href="dialogue">dialogue</a> mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection with two of his lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval, failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already explained to her husband that Horner "knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not let me see it lest I should beg some. But I will find it out, and have what I came for yet" (IV.iii.110). Dialogue such as this made "china" a dirty word in common conversation, Wycherley later claimed.

In another famous scene Lady Fidget's self-styled "virtuous gang" meet up at Horner's lodging to carouse, throw off their public virtue, and behave exactly like male rakes, singing riotous songs and drinking defiant toasts. Finally each of the ladies triumphantly declares that Horner himself is the very lover they have been toasting, and a mayhem of jealousy breaks out as they realise that their friends have also been receiving Horner's favours. But they quickly realise they have no choice but to keep the scandalous secret: "Well then, there's no remedy, sister sharers, let us not fall out, but have a care of our honour" (V.iv.169).

A scene of the Pinchwife plot that combines farce and nightmare is Pinchwife's attempt to force Mrs Pinchwife to write a haughty farewell letter to Horner, using the Freudian threat to "write whore with this penknife in your face" (IV.ii.95). Like all Pinchwife's efforts it misfires, giving Mrs Pinchwife instead an opportunity to send Horner a fan letter.

People marry for the sake of outward appearances, for example Alithea feels that she has no choice but to marry Sparkish because her status in society expects her to. Wives are treated as property as made evident by Pinchwife who locks Margery in her room and forbids her from speaking to men. Sir Jasper's marriage to Lady Fidget is beneficial to his business; therefore he treats her as his asset. He constantly asks Horner to “watch” her so that she will have no opportunity to make a cuckold out of him. Furthermore, there is a struggle for dominance between men and women. As Pinchwife says, ‘”If we do not cheat women, they’ll cheat us” is the very basis for the chief plot of the play, “which centers upon the exchange of positions of dominance within his own family.” Pinchwife decides to marry a country woman in the hopes that she will not be clever enough to know how to cheat, but his extremes in preventing her exposure to men leads to his downfall. Only the women are expected to remain faithful to their husbands. As a result, Lady Fidget “uses sex as a means of revenge against their husbands and achieve a kind of moral victory over them by making them what they most fear to be cuckolds.”

Initially, Horner is confident that he can seek out the married women who are willing to have affairs because they are the ones who do not care about their honor. Horner seems to believe he is in a position of power over the women because their extramarital affair is with him, but his power wanes during the duration of the play. In Act 5, Scene 4, Lady Fidget, Dainty Fidget, and Mistress Squeamish barge into Horner's lodgings despite his protest, conveying “his lower position that alludes to his disguise: a lowly eunuch.” They talk about him as if he was not present, referring to him as a ‘beast,’ ‘toad,’ and eunuch. Cohen says, “As the ladies grow in aggressive self-confidence, Lady Fidget also ‘claps him on the back’ thereby revealing the altered socio-sexual roles that are now presented.” While Horner thinks he is manipulating the women, he has “exhausted his sexual resources and has, in reality, become that impotent and useless object with the world publicly recognizes him to be.” Horner's true power is not in relationship to the women, but to the men. He shows his dominance over the men he cuckolds.

Andrew Kaufman claims that although Horner may seem to pretend to despise women because of his pretended state as a eunuch, his hatred towards women is real. When asked whether he enjoys the company of women, “Horner’s language in a constant barrage of hostile wit, discharging hostility which cannot, at the moment, be directly expressed. His characteristic action, verbally, is to ‘unmask’ women.”

"The Country Wife" was first performed in January 1675, by the King's Company, at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>. This luxurious playhouse, designed by <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a> and with room for 2,000 spectators, had opened only the year before. It was of compact design, retaining in spite of its large <a href="seating%20capacity">seating capacity</a> much of the intimate actor/audience contact of the Elizabethan theatre, still with an almost Elizabethan-size forestage or <a href="apron%20stage">apron stage</a>, on which actors would come forward for maximum audience contact.

The original cast was listed in the first edition of "The Country Wife", as was standard practice, and modern scholars have suggested that this information throws light on Wycherley's intentions. Wycherley wrote with the original actors in mind, tailoring the roles to their strengths. Also, since the audience consisted mostly of habitual playgoers, authors and directors could use the associations of an actor's previous repertoire to enrich or undercut a character, effects familiar on television and in the cinema today.

Several of the actors were specialised comedians, notably <a href="Joseph%20Haines">Joseph Haines</a> who played the false-wit character Sparkish, Alithea's original fiancé. At the outset of his high-profile career as comedian and song-and-dance man, young Haines already had a reputation for eccentricity and dominant stage presence, suggesting that Sparkish is not merely a comic butt for the truewits Horner, Harcourt, and Dorilant to mock, but also a real threat to the romance of Harcourt and Alithea.

The male leads Horner and Harcourt were played by the contrasted actors <a href="Charles%20Hart%20%2817th-century%20actor%29">Charles Hart</a> and <a href="Edward%20Kynaston">Edward Kynaston</a> (or Kenaston). The forcefully masculine 45-year-old Hart "was celebrated for superman roles, notably the arrogant, bloodthirsty Almanzor in <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a>'s "<a href="The%20Conquest%20of%20Granada">Conquest of Granada</a>"", and also for playing rakish comedy heroes with nonchalance and charisma. Many critics credit the personalities and skills of Hart and <a href="Nell%20Gwyn">Nell Gwyn</a> with creating, as much as any playwright did, the famous flirting/bantering Restoration comedy couple. The beautiful <a href="androgynous">androgynous</a> Kynaston, probably in his early thirties, was a different kind of hero. He had started his career in 1660 as the outstanding Restoration female impersonator "the prettiest woman in the whole house" before real women entered the profession in the fall of 1660. (The 2004 movie "<a href="Stage%20Beauty">Stage Beauty</a>" is loosely based on Kynaston's career.)

John Harold Wilson argues that the famously virile stage presence of Hart as Horner must be taken into account when interpreting the play. As personified by Hart, Horner will have won women not so much through clever trickery as "the old-fashioned way", by being "dangerously attractive", and it is only fools like Sir Jaspar Fidget who really believe him harmless. Harcourt/Kynaston, although by 1675 a well-regarded and skilful actor of male roles, would clearly have been overshadowed by Horner/Hart. The actresses associated with each hero must also have tended to make the Horner plot more striking on the stage than the true-love plot. Horner's primary mistress Lady Fidget, spokeswoman for "the virtuous gang" of secretly sex-hungry town wives, was played by the dynamic <a href="Elizabeth%20Knepp">Elizabeth Knepp</a>, who <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a> declared "the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest I've ever heard", talents that the famous drinking scene in Horner's lodging seems designed to do justice to. By contrast, the choice of the bit-part actress Elizabeth James as Alithea would have de-emphasised the Harcourt-Alithea plot. Such historical considerations have made modern critics sceptical of Norman Holland's classic 1959 "right way/wrong way" interpretation of the play, which positions the true-love plot as the most important one.

The play had a good initial run, although Horner's trick and the notorious china scene immediately raised offence. Wycherley laughed off such criticisms in his next play, "The Plain Dealer" (1676), where he has the hypocritical Olivia exclaim that the china scene in "The Country Wife" "has quite taken away the reputation of poor china itself, and sullied the most innocent and pretty furniture of a lady's chamber". Olivia's sensible cousin Eliza insists that she'll go see "The Country Wife" anyway: "All this will not put me out of conceit with china, nor the play, which is acted today, or another of the same beastly author's, as you call him, which I'll go see." Writing himself into "The Plain Dealer" as the "beastly author" of the china scene, Wycherley seems more amused than repentant. "The Country Wife" did in fact survive the complaints to become a dependable <a href="repertory">repertory</a> play from 1675 till the mid-1740s, but by then public taste had changed too much to put up with the sex jokes any longer. Its last eighteenth century performance in 1753 was followed by a hiatus of 171 years, until the successful Phoenix Society production in 1924 at the Regent Theatre in London. The first-ever American performance of Wycherley's original "Country Wife" took place in 1931.

During its long banishment from the stage, "The Country Wife" continued a shadowy existence in the form of <a href="David%20Garrick">David Garrick</a>'s cleaned-up version "The Country Girl" (1766), where Margery is a virgin and Horner her romantic lover. This play was very popular, going through at least twenty editions, reaching the New York stage in 1794, and surviving in both London and New York into the twentieth century. The few modern critics who have read Garrick's version typically dismiss it as "sentimental and boring, where "The Country Wife" is astringent and provocative". Wycherley's original is now again a stage classic, with countless professional and amateur performances, an actors' favourite because of the high number of good parts it offers. The movie "<a href="Shampoo%20%28film%29">Shampoo</a>" (1975), with <a href="Warren%20Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> as the Horner character, is a somewhat distant version of "The Country Wife" after exactly 300 years, reportedly inspired by the <a href="Chichester%20Festival">Chichester Festival</a> production of 1969. There was a BBC "<a href="Play%20of%20the%20Month">Play of the Month</a>" production of "The Country Wife", in 1977, in which <a href="Anthony%20Andrews">Anthony Andrews</a> plays Horner and <a href="Helen%20Mirren">Helen Mirren</a> plays Margery.

"The Country Wife" was also restaged as a musical "Lust". Written by the <a href="Heather%20Brothers">Heather Brothers</a>, it was first performed at the <a href="Queens%20Theatre%20in%20Hornchurch">Queens Theatre in Hornchurch</a> in the London Borough of Havering in 1992. It later transferred to the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%20Haymarket">Theatre Royal Haymarket</a> in London's West End, starring <a href="Denis%20Lawson">Denis Lawson</a> as Horner. The production & Lawson then moved to the John Houseman Theatre in New York in 1995.

The 1977 BBC TV production of the play, with <a href="Bernard%20Cribbins">Bernard Cribbins</a>, <a href="Helen%20Mirren">Helen Mirren</a> and <a href="Anthony%20Andrews">Anthony Andrews</a> was later released on DVD. On 13 April 2008, an adaptation was broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a> directed by David Blount and featuring Ben Miller as Horner, <a href="Geoffrey%20Whitehead">Geoffrey Whitehead</a> as Pinchwife, Clare Corbett as Mrs. Margery Pinchwife, <a href="Nigel%20Anthony">Nigel Anthony</a> as Sir Jasper Fidget, <a href="Celia%20Imrie">Celia Imrie</a> as Lady Fidget and <a href="Jonathan%20Keeble">Jonathan Keeble</a> as Harcourt.

From its creation until the mid-20th century, "The Country Wife" was subject to both aesthetic praise and moral outrage. Many critics through the centuries have acknowledged its linguistic energy and wit, including even Victorians such as <a href="James%20Henry%20Leigh%20Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a>, who praised its literary quality in a selection of Restoration plays that he published in 1840 (itself a daring undertaking, for reputedly "obscene" plays that had been long out of print). However, in an influential review of Hunt's edition, <a href="Thomas%20Babington%20Macaulay%2C%201st%20Baron%20Macaulay">Thomas Babington Macaulay</a> swept aside questions of literary merit, claiming with indignation that "Wycherley's indecency is protected against the critics as a skunk is protected against the hunters. It is safe, because it is too filthy to handle and too noisome even to approach." Margery Pinchwife, regarded in Wycherley's own time as a purely comic character, was denounced by Macaulay as a scarlet woman who threw herself into "a licentious intrigue of the lowest and least sentimental kind".
It was Macaulay, not Hunt, who set the keynote for the 19th century. The play was impossible equally to stage and to discuss, forgotten and obscure.

Academic critics of the first half of the 20th century continued to approach "The Country Wife" gingerly, with frequent warnings about its "heartlessness", even as they praised its keen social observation. At this time nobody found it funny, and positive criticism tried to rescue it as satire and social criticism rather than as comedy. Macaulay's "licentious" Mrs. Pinchwife becomes in the 20th century a focus for moral concern: to critics such as Bonamy Dobrée, she is a tragic character, destined to have her naiveté cruelly taken advantage of by the "grim, nightmare figure" of Horner.

The past fifty years have seen a major change, and academic critics have acknowledged the play as a powerful and original work. Norman Holland's widely influential proposal in 1959 of a "right way/wrong way" reading took Wycherley's morality with innovative seriousness and interpreted the play as presenting two bad kinds of masculinity Horner's libertinism and Pinchwife's possessiveness and recommending the golden mean of Harcourt, the true lover, the representative of mutual trust in marriage. A competing milestone approach of the same generation is that of Rose Zimbardo (1965), who discusses the play in generic and historical terms as a fierce social satire.

Both these types of reading have now fallen out of favour; there is little consensus about the meaning of "The Country Wife", but its "notorious resistance to interpretation" is having an invigorating rather than damping effect on academic interest. The play's ideological dimension has been emphasised recently. It was written by a courtier for a courtly and <a href="Aristocracy%20%28class%29">aristocratic</a> audience, and Douglas Canfield has pointed to an unusual complication for a courtly play. Horner's acts of <a href="cuckold">cuckold</a>ing aggression are directed not only at disrupting middle-class families of "the City", in the usual way of the aristocratic <a href="rake%20%28character%29">Restoration rake</a>, but also at his own, upper, class, the inhabitants of "the Town" the new and fashionable quarters (the future West End) that had sprung up west of the medieval City walls after the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%20London">Great Fire of London</a> in 1666. The courtier code proposed by Wycherley is of a sexual game. <a href="Eve%20Kosofsky%20Sedgwick">Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick</a> argued in "Between Men" that the game is played not between men and women, but between men by means of women, who are merely the "conduits" of <a href="homosocial">homosocial</a> desire between men. The hierarchy of wits meant that the wittiest and most virile man would win at the game. Thus Horner, as Canfield puts it, "represents not just class superiority, but that subset of class represented by the Town wits, a privileged minority that ... is the jet set identified with the Town and the Court as the loci of real power in the kingdom." The aggressive attack mounted in the china scene against the class and the generation by which Wycherley was <a href="patronage">patronised</a> with the expectation that he would defend it (against Sir Jaspar Fidget and Lady Fidget), suggests Canfield, would only let an audience of that class laugh comfortably if Horner were punished by actual impotence in the end, which he is not. "When the play concludes with no poetical justice that makes Horner really impotent", writes Canfield, "leaving him instead potent and still on the make, the audience laughs at its own expense: the women of quality nervously because they have been misogynistically slandered; the men of quality nervously because at some level they recognize that class solidarity is just a pleasing fiction."

The <a href="Hobey%20Baker%20Award">Hobey Baker Award</a> was introduced in 1980, awarded annually to the best collegiate hockey player.

Baker was born in <a href="Bala%20Cynwyd%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania</a>, the second son of Alfred Thornton Baker, a wealthy <a href="upholstery">upholsterer</a>, and Mary Augusta Pemberton, a socialite. Alfred, known as Bobby to his friends, had played <a href="Halfback%20%28American%20football%29">halfback</a> while a student at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> in the 1880s, the same school his father had attended. One of Baker's ancestors was <a href="Francis%20Rawle">Francis Rawle</a>, a <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> who emigrated to Philadelphia in 1688 and became one of the wealthiest members of the city. Baker was named after his uncle, Dr. Hobart Amory Hare, who was the <a href="obstetrician">obstetrician</a> at his birth and president of the Jefferson Medical Hospital in Philadelphia. At the age of eleven, Baker and his twelve-year-old brother Thornton were sent to <a href="St.%20Paul%27s%20School%20%28Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire%29">St. Paul's School</a> in <a href="Concord%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Concord, New Hampshire</a>. Baker's parents divorced in 1907 and both remarried.

While at St. Paul's, Baker was introduced to <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a>. <a href="Malcolm%20Gordon">Malcolm Gordon</a>, one of the first people to help develop hockey in the United States, was the coach of the school team and recognized Baker's skill. Baker was known by his classmates to be an exceptionally fast and agile skater. He spent nights skating on frozen ponds to improve his ability to <a href="wiktionary%3Astickhandle">move with the puck while not looking down</a>. Baker was named to the school's varsity team at the age of fourteen and helped St. Paul's defeat some of the best prep schools and universities in the United States. In every sport he attempted, Baker soon demonstrated proficiency. His cousin said that Baker swam through water "like some sort of engine". After his first attempt at <a href="golf">golf</a> he was able to score in the low 40s on the school's nine-hole course; after using <a href="roller%20skates">roller skates</a> for the first time, he was able to perform one-legged stunts within minutes. He once entered St. Paul's annual cross-country race for fun and won, defeating some of the school's most proficient runners. At the age of fifteen he was named the school's best athlete for his skill in hockey, football, baseball, tennis, swimming, and track. Most of his former classmates recalled their time at St. Paul's with Baker solely by his athletic achievements.

Alfred Baker lost much of his savings in the <a href="Panic%20of%201907">Panic of 1907</a> and could only afford to send one of his sons to college. Thornton agreed to let his talented younger brother continue his education, a sacrifice that Hobey Baker never forgot. Although an above-average student, Baker stayed an extra year at St. Paul's in 1909 to allow his father another year to save money. By the time Baker left St. Paul's, his sporting achievements had helped make him one of the school's most popular students.

In 1910, Baker enrolled at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> as a member of the Class of 1914. Along with six other classmates from St. Paul's, he lived in a house at <a href="Nassau%20Street%20%28Princeton%29">82 Nassau Street</a> in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton</a>. He joined the school's hockey, football, and baseball teams in his freshman year. The university's rules stated that students could only play two <a href="varsity%20sports">varsity sports</a>, so Baker played <a href="outfield">outfield</a> for the freshman baseball team before he gave up that sport to focus on hockey and football. In one of his first games with the <a href="Princeton%20Tigers%20football">football team</a>, he helped defeat rival <a href="Yale%20Bulldogs%20football">Yale</a> when he faked a drop-kick field goal and instead ran the ball for a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>. Easily recognizable on the field because he wore no helmet, Baker was referred to as "the blond <a href="Adonis">Adonis</a> of the gridiron" by Philadelphia sportswriters. Princeton finished the 1911 season with a record of eight wins and two ties in ten games and won the national championship. During a game against Yale on November 18, 1911, Baker set a school record that still stands when he had 13 <a href="punt%20returns">punt returns</a> for 63 yards.

During the 1911 football season Baker scored 92 points, a school record that lasted until 1974. Princeton finished the 1912 season with seven wins, one loss, and one tie in nine games. As the Princeton hockey team did not have its own ice rink, most of their home games were played in New York City at the <a href="St.%20Nicholas%20Rink">St. Nicholas Rink</a>, one of the few facilities in the world with <a href="ice%20rink%23Artificial%20ice%20rink">artificial ice</a> at the time. The team finished the 1911–12 hockey season with a record of eight wins and two losses in ten games. During his sophomore year, Baker was invited to join the <a href="Ivy%20Club">Ivy Club</a>, the oldest and most prestigious of the <a href="eating%20clubs%20at%20Princeton%20University">eating clubs</a> that were at the center of social life at the university.

Baker was named captain of the football team in 1913, his senior year. Princeton finished with a record of five wins, two losses, and one tie. Over his three-year football career with the Tigers, Baker scored 180 points, a school record that lasted until 1964 when <a href="Cosmo%20Iacavazzi">Cosmo Iacavazzi</a> broke it in the final quarter of his last college game. Baker caught over 900 <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punts</a> in his career, and averaged 300 yards in punt returns per season. He was awarded a <a href="varsity%20letter">varsity letter</a> in football five times; combined with the three letters he earned in hockey, his total was the most that could be earned at Princeton at the time.
It was during the 1913–14 hockey season, Baker's senior year, that his most famous game with Princeton took place. On January 24, they played Harvard at the <a href="Boston%20Arena">Boston Arena</a>. Initially the favorite to win, Princeton had a setback as one of its star players was injured and unable to play, and another was suspended. Baker was repeatedly called <a href="offside%20%28ice%20hockey%29">offside</a>, as he was too fast for the two replacement Princeton players (players were required to stay behind the puck-carrier at the time). In the "sudden death" overtime, after sixty minutes of play, Baker was not even breathing heavily. The game was the longest college hockey game played up to that point.

The final hockey game of Baker's Princeton career was at Ottawa's <a href="Dey%27s%20Arena">Dey's Arena</a> against the <a href="University%20of%20Ottawa">University of Ottawa</a> on February 28, 1914, for the Intercollegiate Hockey Championship of America. Ottawa defeated Princeton by a 3–2 score. Princeton won the 1914 national championship after they finished with a record of ten wins and three losses. Statistics were not kept of his time at Princeton, but biographer <a href="Emil%20Salvini">Emil Salvini</a> estimated Baker to have scored over 120 goals and 100 assists in three years, an average of three goals and three assists per game. As well as skill, Baker was known for his sportsmanship. In a hockey game against <a href="Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey">Harvard</a> on January 22, 1913, Baker suffered the only <a href="penalty%20%28ice%20hockey%29">penalty</a> of his collegiate career, for <a href="slashing%20%28ice%20hockey%29">slashing</a>; Princeton lost the game 5–4 in overtime. He visited the dressing rooms of opponents after every game to shake hands with each player.

In early 1914, Baker graduated from Princeton, majoring in history, politics, and economics, and finished with above-average grades. He was named the school's best football player, hockey player, and all-round athlete and the man who had done the most for Princeton. The football team had posted a record of twenty wins, three losses, and four ties in Baker's three seasons as a member; the hockey team fared equally well with a record of twenty wins and seven losses. By the end of his football career at Princeton, he had two notable achievements: he had never fumbled a punt, and had never lost to Yale.

The summer after graduation, Baker toured Europe as a celebrity correspondent for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", where he wrote about events like the <a href="Henley%20Royal%20Regatta">Henley Royal Regatta</a>. Through his Princeton classmates, he was hired by <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a> insurance firm <a href="Johnson%20%26amp%3B%20Higgins">Johnson & Higgins</a> upon his return to the United States. Soon after, another Princeton graduate offered him a job at <a href="J.P.%20Morgan%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">J.P. Morgan Bank</a>. Hired onto a two-year trainee program, Baker earned about $20 per week. Baker befriended a rich New York socialite, Percy R. Pyne II, who had also attended St. Paul's and Princeton. Though ten years older than Baker, they quickly became friends and Pyne allowed Baker to stay at his house at <a href="Madison%20Avenue">263 Madison Avenue</a>. Pyne later introduced Baker to Jeanne Marie Scott, a socialite known as Mimi, to whom Baker was briefly engaged late in 1918. A quiet individual, Baker was embarrassed when bank executives brought important clients by his office to see him. He quickly tired of working in an office job, and looked for ways to alleviate his boredom.

Baker found enjoyment outside the office through sports. He joined the <a href="St.%20Nicholas%20Hockey%20Club">St. Nicholas Club</a>, an amateur hockey team in New York, soon after he arrived in the city. Pyne introduced Baker to both <a href="polo">polo</a> and <a href="auto%20racing">auto racing</a>, sports he quickly mastered. Baker remained well known from his time at Princeton; marquees at his home arena, which was shared with Princeton, often said "Hobey Baker Plays Tonight". This made Baker uncomfortable and he eventually asked the building manager to take down the sign. Preferring a life out of the public eye, he once told a reporter that he would rather have nothing written about him. In order to leave the arena quickly after hockey games without having to deal with the public, Baker often borrowed Pyne's valet and car. During the two years that Baker played hockey with St. Nicholas, he was recognized as one of the best players in the <a href="American%20Amateur%20Hockey%20League">American Amateur Hockey League</a> and named to the post-season All-Star Teams both years. While still with the St. Nicholas Club, Baker was offered a contract by the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20Association">National Hockey Association</a>. He turned down an offer of $20,000 to play three seasons as social conventions prohibited a person of his standing from playing sports for money.

On March 24, 1917, Baker played his last hockey game at the <a href="Winter%20Garden%20at%20Exposition%20Hall">Winter Garden at Exposition Hall</a> in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>. The game pitted an amateur all-star team from Philadelphia, led by Baker, against an all-star team from Pittsburgh's amateur leagues. The Philadelphia team defeated Pittsburgh in overtime by a score of 3–2. Baker scored all three Philadelphia goals to net a <a href="hat%20trick">hat trick</a>. Baker began to tire of playing hockey after 1915; the constant physical play of opposing players on the ice had taken its toll, and the growing professionalism of the sport went against his belief that sports should be played for the love of the game.

Looking for new adventures, in 1916 he joined a civilian aviation corps led by New York City attorney Phillip A. Carroll on <a href="Governors%20Island">Governors Island</a>, off the coast of Manhattan, a privately funded program to train civilians to pass the <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force%20aeronautical%20rating">Reserve Military Aviator flying test</a> and receive commissions in the <a href="Aviation%20Section%2C%20U.S.%20Signal%20Corps">Signal Officers Reserve Corps</a>. He often went to the island late in the afternoon after he finished work for the day. Baker found the same enjoyment in flying that he had in sports, but with a more serious aspect. Prior to the annual Yale–Princeton football game on November 18, 1916, Baker in a <a href="Curtiss%20JN-2">Curtiss "Jenny"</a> flown by fellow Governors Island student Cord Meyer (a Yalie), joined a <a href="102d%20Rescue%20Squadron">squadron of New York National Guard</a> Jennies led by Captain <a href="Raynal%20Bolling">Raynal Bolling</a>, the most to have ever flown in military formation, and flew to <a href="Palmer%20Stadium">Palmer Stadium</a>, home of the Princeton football team. The planes performed several maneuvers, to the delight of the crowd, and Baker landed on the field, becoming the first person to reach a football game by air.

The entry of the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally gave him a purpose in life and allowed him to make good use of his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be certified by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he would ever get to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.

Baker was finally sent to the front in April and assigned to the <a href="103d%20Aero%20Squadron">103d Aero Squadron</a>, formed from former members of the <a href="Lafayette%20Escadrille">Lafayette Escadrille</a> and <a href="Lafayette%20Flying%20Corps">Lafayette Flying Corps</a> in January 1918. Baker helped to bring down an enemy plane for the first time in his career on May 21, but due to a complicated system of confirming kills, he was not given credit for it. In a letter home describing the battle, Baker said it was the "biggest thrill I ever had in my life", and compared it to the feeling after a big sports game. Throughout the spring of 1918 Baker continued to lead planes over the front, and continued to see Scott, although he began to have reservations over their future together due to the financial disparity between them. After his first confirmed kill on May 21, 1918, the French government awarded him the <a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de Guerre</a>.

During the summer, Baker was transferred to the <a href="13th%20Bomb%20Squadron">13th Aero Squadron</a> after its commander, Captain <a href="Charles%20J.%20Biddle%20%28aviator%29">Charles Biddle</a>, requested that he join the squadron as a flight commander. Though reluctant to leave the 103rd, Baker felt that Biddle would not have requested him without confidence in his abilities. On July 20, the 13th Squadron recorded its first confirmed kill during a flight led by Baker; he and two other men shot down a German plane. In August, Baker and another pilot were promoted and given command of their own squadron; Baker was given charge of the <a href="141st%20Air%20Refueling%20Squadron">141st Aero Squadron</a>, composed of 26 pilots and 180 enlisted men stationed behind the front line, where they had to wait for equipment to arrive before leaving for the front.

Various delays in the arrival of planes and equipment meant that Baker's squadron was unable to participate in the final major offensives of the war. In September, Baker became engaged to Scott. He asked Pyne to sell a bond to pay for an engagement ring, and the newspapers in the United States carried headlines that announced the engagement. Early in October, Baker was promoted again and given the rank of captain. The planes and equipment arrived for his squadron soon after. Baker had the planes painted in Princeton's black and orange and adopted a tiger for the squadron insignia. He recorded two more kills on October 28 and November 5, the last of his career (despite reports at the time of his death, Baker was not an <a href="flying%20ace">ace</a>, as that required five confirmed kills).

Around the time of the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">armistice</a> which ended the war, Baker's engagement with Scott was broken off; Scott then began a relationship with an American diplomat in Paris, Philander Cable. Missing his fiancée and the excitement of the war, he felt directionless; he dreaded going back to work in an office and considered himself a sportsman rather than a businessman. Though he was scheduled to return to the United States in December, Baker requested and was refused an extension of his time in France.

On December 21, 1918, Baker received orders to return to the United States. Reluctant to leave France and return to his life in America, he decided to take a final flight at his squadron's airfield in <a href="Toul">Toul</a>. As he went for his own plane, the mechanic brought out a recently repaired one instead, in need of a test flight. The other pilots remonstrated with Baker, but he maintained that as commanding officer he could not let anyone else test the aircraft.

In heavy rain, Baker took off and began to level off at 600 feet. A quarter of a mile into the flight, the engine failed. The plane was generally easy to crash-land if necessary, something he had done previously at the cost of a few broken ribs.

A few hundred yards from the airfield, his plane crashed nose first into the ground. He was quickly freed from the aircraft by his men, but died in an ambulance minutes later; his orders to return home were found in his jacket pocket. Baker was buried in a small military cemetery near Toul; in 1921, his mother had his remains moved to her family plot in <a href="West%20Laurel%20Hill%20Cemetery">West Laurel Hill Cemetery</a>, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

Though newspapers reported that Baker had died as a result of engine failure, unsubstantiated rumors began to circulate that his death was not accidental. Those who knew him were aware of his reluctance to return to civilian life and his feelings over the loss of Scott. He could have returned to America and played professional sport, where he could have earned far more money than from a job in finance, but his upbringing made that impossible for him. A career in business held no appeal; during a weekend vacation with a fellow Princeton graduate, Baker revealed that he felt his life was over, and he would never again experience the thrills of football or hockey. In 1966, author John D. Davies published a biography of Baker, in which he noted that a relative of Baker's could not see a future for him in the post-war world. However, Davies refused to elaborate on what he called the "suicide theory of [Baker's] enigmatic death", as he feared that "some of the old guard would be furious if they thought I was trying to prove it".

Baker is considered one of the greatest ice hockey players of his era, and the first great American hockey player. He was one of the first nine players inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> upon its founding in 1945, the first American so honored, and was inducted into the <a href="United%20States%20Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">United States Hockey Hall of Fame</a> as one of its charter members in 1973. Baker was posthumously awarded the <a href="Lester%20Patrick%20Trophy">Lester Patrick Trophy</a> by the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> and <a href="USA%20Hockey">USA Hockey</a> in 1987 for his contributions to hockey in the United States. In 1975, he was inducted into the <a href="College%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">College Football Hall of Fame</a> and is the only person in both the College Football and Hockey Halls of Fame. Baker was also inducted into the <a href="Philadelphia%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame</a> in 2010.

His popularity was such that, after he enlisted in the military, so many of his fellow Princeton athletes followed his lead that the school had to cancel its hockey team for the 1917–18 season; all five starting players enlisted in the armed forces. Of the eleven players on the team the previous season, nine enlisted shortly after Baker.

Baker was also the inspiration for literary works. In 1913 <a href="F.%20Scott%20Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> enrolled at Princeton as a freshman, when Baker was a senior. Though he only spoke to Baker once during their time at Princeton, Fitzgerald idolized him. His first novel, "<a href="This%20Side%20of%20Paradise">This Side of Paradise</a>", has several references to Baker: the main character is named Amory Blaine after Baker's middle name, and the minor character Allenby is Baker himself. Mark Goodman's 1985 novel "Hurrah for the Next Man Who Dies" is a fictionalized account of Baker's life.

Baker's honors included a citation on March 27, 1919, by General <a href="John%20J.%20Pershing">John Pershing</a>, commander of the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Forces">American Expeditionary Forces</a>, for exceptional bravery on May 21, 1918, when he brought down his first plane. The <a href="Hobey%20Baker%20Award">Hobey Baker Award</a> was established in 1981 and is awarded annually to the best player in NCAA hockey. The <a href="Hobey%20Baker%20Legends%20of%20College%20Hockey%20Award">Hobey Baker Legends of College Hockey Award</a> was also created that year and is given to the "all-time great contributors to the game of college hockey" each year. Since 1950, Princeton has awarded the Hobey Baker Trophy to the "freshman hockey player who, among his classmates, in play, sportsmanship and influence has contributed most to the sport." When Princeton opened their hockey arena in 1921, it was named the <a href="Hobey%20Baker%20Memorial%20Rink">Hobey Baker Memorial Rink</a>. At St. Paul's, hockey players compete for an award known as "Hobey's Stick". Inside the bar of the Nassau Inn in Princeton is a photo of Baker flanked by two other famous Princeton athletes, <a href="Bill%20Bradley">Bill Bradley</a> and <a href="Dick%20Kazmaier">Dick Kazmaier</a>. The Ivy Club, of which Baker was a member, has had a painting of him in the living room.

Installed in 2001, there is a life size bust of Baker, by sculptor <a href="Dony%20MacManus">Dony MacManus</a>, in St. Paul's School.

Judah P. Benjamin

Judah Philip Benjamin, <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">QC</a> (August 11, 1811 – May 6, 1884) was a lawyer and politician who was a <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a> from Louisiana, a <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Cabinet officer of the Confederate States</a> and, after his escape to the United Kingdom at the end of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, an English <a href="Barristers%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">barrister</a>. Benjamin was the first <a href="Jew">Jew</a> to be elected to the United States Senate who had not renounced that faith, and was the first Jew to hold a Cabinet position in North America. He was successively the <a href="Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a>, <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>, and <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>.

Benjamin was born to <a href="Spanish%20and%20Portuguese%20Jews">Sephardic Jew</a>ish parents from London, who had moved to <a href="St.%20Croix">St. Croix</a> in the <a href="Danish%20West%20Indies">Danish West Indies</a> when it was occupied by Britain during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. Seeking greater opportunities, his family immigrated to the United States, eventually settling in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. Judah Benjamin attended <a href="Yale%20University">Yale College</a> but left without graduating. He moved to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, where he <a href="read%20law">read law</a> and <a href="Admission%20to%20the%20bar%20in%20the%20United%20States">passed the bar</a>.

Benjamin rose rapidly both at the bar and in politics. He became a wealthy <a href="Planter%20%28American%20South%29">planter</a> and slaveowner and was elected to and served in both houses of the Louisiana legislature prior to his election by the legislature to the US Senate in 1852. There, he was an eloquent supporter of slavery. After Louisiana seceded in 1861, Benjamin resigned as senator and returned to New Orleans.

He soon moved to Richmond after <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> President <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> appointed him as <a href="Confederate%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a>. Benjamin had little to do in that position, but Davis was impressed by his competence and appointed him as <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>. Benjamin firmly supported Davis, and the President reciprocated the loyalty by promoting him to <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> in March 1862, while Benjamin was being criticized for the rebel defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Roanoke%20Island">Battle of Roanoke Island</a>.

As Secretary of State, Benjamin attempted to gain official recognition for the Confederacy by <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">France</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, but his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. To preserve the Confederacy as military defeats made its situation increasingly desperate, he advocated freeing and arming the slaves late in the war, but his proposals were only partially accepted in the closing month of the war. When Davis fled the Confederate capital of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a> in early 1865, Benjamin went with him. He left the presidential party and was successful in escaping from the mainland United States, but Davis was captured by Union troops. Benjamin sailed to Great Britain, where he settled and became a barrister, again rising to the top of his profession before retiring in 1883. He died in Paris the following year.

Judah Philip Benjamin was born on August 11, 1811, in <a href="Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">St. Croix</a> of the <a href="Danish%20West%20Indies">Danish West Indies</a> (today the <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a>), a colony then occupied by the British during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. His parents were <a href="Sephardic%20Jews">Sephardic Jews</a> from London, Philip Benjamin and the former Rebecca de Mendes. Philip and Rebecca had been shopkeepers and migrated to the West Indies in search of better opportunities. Rebecca's family had been prominent in Spain before being forced to leave under the <a href="Expulsion%20of%20the%20Jews%20from%20Spain">Expulsion Edict of 1492</a>.

Judah, the third of seven children, was given the same name as an older brother who died in infancy. Following a tradition adhered to by some Sephardi, he was named for his paternal grandfather, who performed the "<a href="brit%20milah">brit milah</a>", or circumcision ceremony. The Benjamins encountered hard times in the Danish West Indies, as normal trade was blocked by the British occupation. In 1813 the Benjamin family moved to <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Fayetteville, North Carolina</a>, where they had relatives. Philip Benjamin was not financially successful there, and around 1821 moved with his family to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. That city had the largest Jewish community in the United States and a reputation for religious tolerance. Benjamin was learned in his faith but not a successful businessman; Rebecca earned money for the family by operating a fruit stand near the harbor. Phillip Benjamin was a first cousin and business partner of <a href="Moses%20Elias%20Levy">Moses Elias Levy</a> from the West Indies. Levy also immigrated to the United States, in the early 1820s.

Judah and two siblings were boarded with relatives in Fayetteville for about 18 months after the rest of the family moved to Charleston. He attended the Fayetteville Academy, a well-regarded school where his intelligence was recognized. In Charleston, his father was among the founders of the first <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform</a> congregation in the United States. It developed practices that included shorter services conducted in English rather than in Hebrew. Benjamin was ultimately expelled from that community, as he did not keep the Sabbath. The extent of Judah's religious education is uncertain. The boy's intelligence was noted by others in Charleston, one of whom offered to finance his education.

At the age of 14, in 1825, Benjamin entered <a href="Yale%20University">Yale College</a>, an institution popular among white Southerners; Vice President <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>, a South Carolinian, was among its alumni. Although Benjamin was successful as a student at Yale, he left abruptly in 1827 without completing his course of study. The reasons for this are uncertain: in 1861, when Louisiana left the Union and Benjamin resigned as a U.S. senator, an abolitionist newspaper alleged that he had been caught as a thief at Yale. He considered bringing suit for <a href="libel">libel</a> but litigation was impractical. In 1901, his sole surviving classmate wrote that Benjamin had been expelled for gambling. One of his biographers, Robert Meade, considered the evidence of wrongdoing by Benjamin to be "too strong to be ignored", but noted that at the time Benjamin left Yale, he was only 16 years old.

After a brief return to Charleston, Benjamin moved to <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>. According to Rabbi Bertram W. Korn's volume on that city's Jews, he "arrived in New Orleans in 1828, with no visible assets other than the wit, charm, omnivorous mind and boundless energy with which he would find his place in the sun". After working in a mercantile business, he became a clerk for a law firm, where he began to <a href="read%20law">read law</a>, studying as an apprentice. Knowledge of French was important in practicing law in Louisiana, as <a href="Law%20of%20Louisiana">the state's code</a> was (and is still) based on French and Spanish law. To earn money, he tutored <a href="Louisiana%20Creole%20people">French Creoles</a> in English; he taught the language to Natalie Bauché de St. Martin on the condition that she teach him French. In late 1832, at age 21, he was admitted to the bar.

Early the following year, Benjamin married Natalie, who was Catholic and from a wealthy French Creole family. As part of her dowry, she brought with her $3,000 and two female <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a>, aged 11 and 16 (together worth about $1,000). Even before the marriage, Natalie St. Martin had scandalized New Orleans society by her conduct. William De Ville, in his journal article on the Benjamin marriage contract, suggests that the "St. Martin family was not terribly distraught to be rid of their young daughter" and that "Benjamin was virtually suborned to marry [Natalie], and did so without hesitation in order to further his ambitions".

The marriage was not a success. By the 1840s, Natalie Benjamin was living in Paris with the couple's only child, Ninette, whom she raised as a Catholic. Benjamin would visit them annually. While a senator, in the late 1850s he persuaded Natalie to rejoin him and expensively furnished a home in Washington for all three to live in. Natalie and their daughter soon embarked again for France. Benjamin, publicly humiliated by his failure to keep Natalie, consigned the household goods to auction. There were rumors, never substantiated, that Benjamin was impotent and that Natalie was unfaithful.

Benjamin's troubled married life has led to speculation that he was <a href="homosexual">gay</a>. Daniel Brook, in a 2012 article about Benjamin, suggests that early biographies read as though "historians are presenting him as an almost farcically stereotypical gay man and yet wear such impervious heteronormative blinders that they themselves know not what they write". These conjectures were not given scholarly weight until 2001, when in an introduction to a reprinting of Meade's biography of Benjamin, Civil War historian <a href="William%20C.%20Davis%20%28historian%29">William C. Davis</a> acknowledged "cloaked suggestions that he [Benjamin] was a homosexual".

Within months of his admission to the bar, Benjamin argued his first case before the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Louisiana">Supreme Court of Louisiana</a> and won. Still, clients were slow to come in his first years in practice. He had enough free time to compile and publish, with <a href="Thomas%20Slidell">Thomas Slidell</a>, the "Digest of the Reported Decisions of the Superior Court of the Late Territory of Orleans and the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana" in 1834, which required the analysis of 6,000 cases. The book was an immediate success and helped launch Benjamin's career. When Slidell published a revised edition in 1840, he did so alone, as Benjamin was too busy litigating cases to participate.

Benjamin became a specialist in <a href="commercial%20law">commercial law</a>, of which there was a great deal in New Orleans' busy river port—a center of international commerce and the domestic <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slave trade</a>. By 1840, the city had become the fourth largest in the United States and among the wealthiest. Many of the best lawyers in the country practiced commercial law there, and Benjamin successfully competed with them. In one case, he successfully represented the seller of a slave against allegations that the seller knew the slave had incurable <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.

In 1842, Benjamin had a group of cases with international implications. He represented insurance companies being sued for the value of slaves who had revolted aboard <a href="Creole%20case">the ship "Creole"</a> in 1841, as they were being transported in the <a href="coastwise%20slave%20trade">coastwise slave trade</a> from Virginia to New Orleans. The rebels had sailed the ship to <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a> in <a href="the%20Bahamas">the Bahamas</a>, British territory, where most were freed, as Britain had abolished slavery in 1834. The owners of the slaves brought suit for $150,000 against their insurers, who declined to pay. Benjamin made several arguments, the most prominent of which was that the slaveowners had brought the revolt on themselves by packing the slaves in overcrowded conditions. 

Benjamin said in his brief to the court:

The court ruled for Benjamin's clients, although on other grounds. Benjamin's brief was widely reprinted, including by <a href="abolitionist">abolitionist</a> groups. Historian Eli Evans, Benjamin's biographer, does not believe that the argument in the "Creole" case represented Benjamin's personal view; rather, he was an advocate for his clients in an era when it was usual to write dramatically to distract attention from the weaker points of a case. Evans finds it remarkable and a testament to Benjamin that he could be elected to office in <a href="History%20of%20the%20Southern%20United%20States%23Antebellum%20era%20.281781.E2.80.931860.29">antebellum</a> Louisiana, a slave society, after writing such words.

Benjamin was a supporter of the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> from the time of its formation in the early 1830s. He became increasingly involved in the party, and in 1841 ran unsuccessfully for the <a href="New%20Orleans%20City%20Council">New Orleans Board of Aldermen</a>. The following year, he was nominated for the <a href="Louisiana%20House%20of%20Representatives">Louisiana House of Representatives</a>. He was elected, though the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> alleged fraud: Whig supporters, to obtain the vote at a time when the state had a restrictive property qualification for <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a>, acquired licenses for carriages. A voter did not have to demonstrate that the carriage existed, but his license had to be accepted as evidence of ownership by election officials. The Democratic press blamed Benjamin as the strategist behind this maneuver. In 1844, the legislature voted to hold a constitutional convention, and Benjamin was chosen as a delegate from New Orleans. At the convention, Benjamin successfully opposed counting a slave as three-fifths of a human being for purposes of representation in state elections, as <a href="Three-Fifths%20Compromise">was done in federal elections</a>. His position prevailed, and slaves were not counted at all for electoral purposes in Louisiana state elections. According to Evans, his "tact, courtesy, and ability to find compromises impressed the political elders in all corners of the state".

Rabbi Myron Berman, in his history of Jews in Richmond, describes the attitude of antebellum white Southerners toward Jews:

By the early 1840s, Benjamin was wealthy from his law practice and, with a partner, bought a sugar cane <a href="plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">plantation</a>, Bellechasse. This purchase, and the subsequent construction of a grand house there, advanced Benjamin's ambitions; the planter class controlled Louisiana politics and would trust only a man who also owned substantial land and slaves. The Benjamin marriage was by then failing, and he hoped in vain that his wife would be content at the plantation. Benjamin threw his energy into improving Bellechasse, importing new varieties of sugar cane and adopting up-to-date methods and equipment to extract and process the sugar. He purchased 140 slaves to work the plantation, and had a reputation as a humane slaveowner.

Benjamin scaled back his involvement in politics in the late 1840s, distracted by his plantation and law practice. His mother Rebecca, whom he had brought to New Orleans, died in 1847 during a <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> epidemic. In 1848, Benjamin was a Whig member of the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a>; he voted for fellow Louisiana planter, General <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>, who was elected U.S. President. He and other Louisianans accompanied President-elect Taylor to Washington for his inauguration, and Benjamin attended a state dinner given by outgoing president <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>. In 1850, <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>, who succeeded Taylor after his death earlier that year, appointed Benjamin as judge of the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20California">United States District Court for the Northern District of California</a>. He was confirmed by the Senate, but he declined the appointment as the salary of $3,500 was too small. The following year, Benjamin assisted the <a href="United%20States%20Attorney">United States Attorney</a> in New Orleans in prosecuting American adventurers who had tried to spark a rebellion against Spanish rule in Cuba, but two trials both ended in <a href="hung%20juries">hung juries</a>.

Benjamin became interested in strengthening trade connections between New Orleans and California, and promoted an infrastructure project to build a railroad across the Mexican isthmus near Oaxaca. This would speed passenger traffic and cargo shipments. According to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", in an 1852 speech to a railroad builders' convention, Benjamin said this trade route "belongs to New Orleans. Its commerce makes empires of the countries to which it flows." Benjamin lobbied fellow lawmakers about the project, gained funds from private New York bankers, and even helped organize construction crews. In private correspondence he warned backers of problems; project workers suffered yellow fever, shipments of construction materials hit rough seas, and actions or inaction by both U.S. and Mexican officials caused delays and increases in construction costs. Backers had invested several hundred thousand dollars by the time the project died after the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> in 1861.

Benjamin spent the summer of 1851 abroad, including a visit to Paris to see Natalie and Ninette. He was still away in October 1851, when the Whigs nominated him for the <a href="Louisiana%20State%20Senate">state Senate</a>. Despite his absence, he was easily elected. When the new legislature met in January 1852, Benjamin emerged as one of the leading Whig candidates for election to the U.S. Senate seat that would become vacant on March 4, 1853. As the Louisiana legislature, responsible for electing the state's senators, met once in two years under the 1845 constitution, it was not scheduled to meet again before the seat became vacant. Some Whig newspapers thought Benjamin too young and inexperienced at forty, despite his undoubted talent, but the Whig legislative caucus selected him on the second ballot, and he was elected by the two houses over Democrat <a href="Solomon%20W.%20Downs">Solomon W. Downs</a>.

The outgoing president, Fillmore, offered to nominate Benjamin, a fellow Whig, to fill a Supreme Court vacancy after the Senate Democrats had defeated Fillmore's other nominees for the post. "The New York Times" reported on February 15, 1853, that "if the President nominates Benjamin, the Democrats are determined to confirm him." The new president, <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>, a Democrat, also offered Benjamin a place on the Supreme Court. <a href="Pierce%20Butler%20%28justice%29">Pierce Butler</a>, a future Supreme Court justice, suggested in his 1908 biography of Benjamin that the newly elected senator likely declined these offers not only because he preferred active politics, but because he could maintain his law practice and substantial income as a senator, but could not as a justice. As an advocate before the U.S. Supreme Court, Benjamin won 13 of his first 18 cases.

Judah Benjamin was sworn in as senator from Louisiana on March 4, 1853, at a brief meeting called just prior to President Pierce's inauguration. These new colleagues included <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> of Illinois, <a href="Robert%20M.%20T.%20Hunter">Robert M. T. Hunter</a> of Virginia, and <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> of Texas. The slavery issue was in a brief remission as much of the country wished to accept the <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a> as a final settlement. When the Senate was not in session, Benjamin remained in Washington, D.C., conducting a lucrative practice including many cases before the Supreme Court, then conveniently located in a room of the Capitol. His law partners in New Orleans took care of his firm's affairs there. About this time Benjamin sold his interest in Bellechasse, lacking the time to deal with plantation business.

Benjamin's view that slavery should continue was based in his belief that citizens had a right to their property as guaranteed by the Constitution. As Butler put it, "he could no more see that it was right for Northern people to rob him of his slave than it would be for him to connive at horse stealing". He avoided the arguments of some that the slaves were inferior beings, and that their position was ordained by God: Evans ascribes this to Benjamin not being raised as a slaveowner, but coming to it later in life. Benjamin joined in a widespread view of white Southerners that the African American would not be ready for <a href="emancipation">emancipation</a> for many years, if ever. They feared that freeing the slaves would ruin many and lead to murders and rapes by the newly liberated of their former masters and mistresses. Such a massacre had been feared by Southerners since the <a href="Haitian%20Revolution">Haitian Revolution</a>, the violent revolt known as "Santo Domingo" in the South, in which the slaves of what became Haiti killed many whites and <a href="Mulatto%20Haitian">mulattoes</a> in 1804 while gaining independence from French control. When the anti-slavery book "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>" was published in 1852, Benjamin spoke out against <a href="Harriet%20Beecher%20Stowe">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>'s portrayal. He said that slaves were for the most part well treated, and plantation punishments, such as whipping or branding, were more merciful than sentences of imprisonment that a white man might receive in the North for similar conduct.

In early 1854, Senator Douglas introduced his <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Bill</a>, calling for <a href="popular%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States">popular sovereignty</a> to determine whether the <a href="Kansas%20Territory">Kansas</a> and <a href="Nebraska%20Territory">Nebraska</a> territories should enter the Union as slave or free states. Depending on the outcome of such elections, slavery might spread to territories closed to it under the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> of 1820. In the debate over the bill, Benjamin defended this change as returning to "the traditions of the fathers", that the federal government not legislate on the subject of slavery. He said that the South merely wished to be left alone. The bill passed, but its passage had drastic political effects, as the differences between North and South that had been settled by both the 1820 and 1850 compromises were reopened. The Whig Party was torn apart North from South, with many Northern Whigs joining the new <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>, a group pledged to oppose the spread of slavery. Benjamin continued to caucus with the remains of the Whig Party through 1854 and 1855, but as a member of a legislative minority, he had little influence on legislation, and received no important committee assignments.

In May 1856, Benjamin joined the Democrats, stating they had the principles of the old-time Whig Party. He indicated, in a letter to constituents, that as Northern Whigs had failed to vote to uphold the rights granted to Southern states in the Constitution, the Whigs, as a national party, were no more.

At a state dinner given by Pierce, Benjamin first met <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, whose wife <a href="Varina%20Davis">Varina</a> described the Louisiana senator as having "rather the air of a witty bon vivant than of a great senator". The two men, both ambitious for leadership in the South and the nation, formed a relationship that Evans describes as "respectful but wary". The two had occasional differences; when in 1858, Davis, by then a Mississippi senator, was irritated by Benjamin's questioning him on a military bill and suggested that Benjamin was acting as a paid attorney, the Louisianan challenged him to a duel. Davis apologized.

Benjamin, in his speeches in the Senate, took the position that the Union was a compact by the states from which any of them could secede. Nevertheless, he understood that any dissolution would not be peaceful, stating in 1856 that "dreadful will be the internecine war that must ensue". In 1859, Benjamin was elected to a second term, but allegations of involvement in land scandals and the fact that upstate legislators objected to both of Louisiana's senators being from New Orleans stretched the contest to 42 ballots before he prevailed.

Benjamin worked to deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential nomination, feeling he had turned against the South. Douglas contended that although the Supreme Court, in "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a>", had stated Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, the people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it. This position was anathema to the South. Benjamin praised Douglas's opponent in his re-election bid, former congressman <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas the senator considered Douglas to be a hypocrite. Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the <a href="1860%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1860 convention</a> was not able to nominate anyone and split into Northern and Southern factions. The Northerners backed Douglas while Southern delegates chose Vice President <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a> of Kentucky. Despite their agreement in opposing Douglas, Benjamin and Davis differed on some race issues: in May, Benjamin voted for a bill to aid Africans liberated by U.S. naval vessels from illegal slave ships, in order to return them to their native continent from <a href="Key%20West%2C%20Florida">Key West</a>. Davis and many other Southerners opposed the bill.

Between June and December 1860, Benjamin was almost entirely absorbed in the case of "United States v. Castillero", that was tried in San Francisco during the latter part of that period. The case concerned a land grant by the former Mexican government of California. Castillero had leased part of his land to British mining companies, and when American authorities ruled the grant invalid, they hired Benjamin; he spent four months in San Francisco working on the case. The trial began in October, and Benjamin gave an address lasting six days. The local correspondent for "The New York Times" wrote that Benjamin, "a distinguished stranger", drew the largest crowds to the courtroom and "the Senator is making this terribly tedious case interesting". Benjamin sailed for New York once the case was submitted for decision in early November. The court's ruling, rendered in January 1861, was substantially for the company but, not satisfied, it appealed. It lost the case entirely to an adverse decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, three justices dissenting, the following year. Benjamin was by then a Confederate Cabinet officer, and could not argue the case. His co-counsel filed his brief with the court.

By the time Benjamin returned to the East Coast, the Republican candidate, Lincoln, had been elected president, and there was talk, in Louisiana and elsewhere, of secession from the Union. The "<a href="New%20Orleans%20Times-Picayune">New Orleans Picayune</a>" reported that Benjamin favored secession only in the last resort. On December 23, 1860, another Louisiana periodical, the "Delta", printed a letter from Benjamin dated the eighth stating that, as the people of the North were of unalterable hostility to their Southern brethren, the latter should depart from the government common to them. He also signed a joint letter from Southern congressmen to their constituents, urging the formation of a confederation of the seceding states. According to a letter reportedly written by Benjamin during the crisis, he saw secession as a means of obtaining more favorable terms in a reformed Union.

With Southern opinion turning in favor of secession, Benjamin made a farewell speech in the Senate on December 31, 1860, to a packed gallery, desirous of hearing one of the South's most eloquent voices. They were not disappointed; Evans writes that "historians consider Benjamin's farewell ... one of the great speeches in American history". Benjamin foresaw that the South's departure would lead to civil war:

According to Geoffrey D. Cunningham in his article on Benjamin's role in secession, "Swept up in the popular cries for independence, Benjamin willingly went out with the Southern tide." He and his Louisiana colleague, <a href="John%20Slidell">John Slidell</a>, resigned from the U.S. Senate on February 4, 1861, nine days after their state voted to secede from the Union.

Fearful of arrest as a rebel once he left the Senate, Benjamin quickly departed Washington for New Orleans. On the day of Benjamin's resignation, the <a href="Provisional%20Confederate%20States%20Congress">Provisional Confederate States Congress</a> gathered in <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery, Alabama</a>, and soon chose Davis as president. Davis was sworn in as provisional <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Confederate States President</a> on February 18, 1861. At home in New Orleans for, it would prove, the last time, Benjamin addressed a rally on <a href="Washington%27s%20Birthday">Washington's Birthday</a>, February 22, 1861. On February 25, Davis appointed Benjamin, still in New Orleans, as <a href="attorney%20general">attorney general</a>; the Louisianan was approved immediately and unanimously by the provisional Congress. Davis thus became the first chief executive in North America to appoint a Jew to his Cabinet.

Davis, in his memoirs, remarked that he chose Benjamin because he "had a very high reputation as a lawyer, and my acquaintance with him in the Senate had impressed me with the lucidity of his intellect, his systematic habits, and capacity for labor". Meade suggested that Davis wanted to have a Louisianan in his Cabinet, but that a smarter course of action would have been to send Benjamin abroad to win over the European governments. Butler called Benjamin's appointment "a waste of good material". Historian William C. Davis, in his volume on the formation of the Confederate government, notes, "For some there was next to nothing to do, none more so than Benjamin." The role of the attorney general in a Confederacy that did not yet have federal courts or marshals was so minimal that initial layouts for the building housing the government in Montgomery allotted no space to the Justice Department.

Meade found the time that Benjamin spent as attorney general to be fruitful, as it allowed him the opportunity to judge Davis's character and to ingratiate himself with the president. Benjamin served as a host, entertaining dignitaries and others Davis had no time to see. At the first Cabinet meeting, Benjamin counseled Davis to have the government buy 150,000 bales of cotton for shipment to the United Kingdom, with the proceeds used to buy arms and for future needs. His advice was not taken, as the Cabinet believed the war would be short and successful. Benjamin was called upon from time to time to render legal opinions, writing on April 1 to assure Treasury Secretary <a href="Christopher%20Memminger">Christopher Memminger</a> that lemons and oranges could enter the Confederacy duty-free, but walnuts could not.

Once Virginia joined the Confederacy, the capital was moved to Richmond, though against Benjamin's advice—he believed that the city was too close to the North. Nevertheless, he traveled there with his brother-in-law, Jules St. Martin; the two lived in the same house throughout the war, and Benjamin probably procured the young man's job at the War Department. Although Alabama's <a href="LeRoy%20Pope%20Walker">Leroy Walker</a> was <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>, Davis—a war hero and former U.S. War Secretary—considered himself more qualified and gave many orders himself. When the Confederates were unable to follow up their victory at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Manassas">First Battle of Manassas</a> by threatening Washington, Walker was criticized in the press. In September, Walker resigned to join the army as a brigadier general, and Davis appointed Benjamin in his place. Butler wrote that Davis had found the cheerfully competent Benjamin "a most useful member of the official family, and thought him suited for almost any post in it." In addition to his appointment as War Secretary, Benjamin continued to act as Attorney General until November 15, 1861.

As War Secretary, Benjamin was responsible for a territory stretching from <a href="Virginia%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Virginia</a> to <a href="Texas%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Texas</a>. It was his job, with Davis looking over his shoulder, to supervise the Confederate Army and to feed, supply, and arm it—in a nascent country with almost no arms manufacturers. Accordingly, Benjamin saw his job as closely tied to foreign affairs, as the Confederacy was dependent on imports to supply its troops. Davis had determined on a "defensive war" strategy—the Confederacy would await invasion by the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">North</a>, then seek to defeat its armies until Lincoln tired of sending them. Davis and Benjamin worked together closely, and as Davis came to realize that his subordinate was loyal both to the Confederacy and to Davis personally, he returned complete trust in Benjamin. Varina Davis wrote, "It was to me a curious spectacle, the steady approximation to a thorough friendliness of the President and his War Minister. It was a very gradual rapprochement, but all the more solid for that reason."

In his months as War Secretary, Benjamin sent thousands of communications. According to Evans, Benjamin initially "turn[ed] prejudice to his favor and play[ed] on the Southerner's instinctive respect for the Jewish mind with a brilliant performance". Nevertheless, Benjamin faced difficulties that he could do little about. The Confederacy lacked sufficient soldiers, trained officers to command them, naval and civilian ships, manufacturing capacity to make ships and many weapons, and powder for guns and cannon. The Union had these things, and moved to block the South's access to European supplies, both by blockade and by buying up supplies the South might have secured. Other problems included drunkenness among the men—and their officers—and uncertainty as to when and where the expected Northern invasion would begin. Further, Benjamin had no experience of the military, or of the executive branch of the government, placing him in a poor position to contradict President Davis.

An insurgency against the Confederacy developed in staunchly <a href="Southern%20Unionist">pro-Union</a> <a href="East%20Tennessee">East Tennessee</a> in late 1861, and at Davis's order, Benjamin sent troops to crush it. Once it was put down, Benjamin and Davis were in a quandary about what to do about its leader, <a href="William%20G.%20Brownlow">William "Parson" Brownlow</a>, who had been captured, and eventually allowed him to cross to Union-controlled territory in the hope that it would cause Lincoln to release Confederate prisoners. While Brownlow was in Southern custody, he stated that he expected, "no more mercy from Benjamin than was shown by his illustrious predecessors towards Jesus Christ".

Benjamin had difficulty in managing the Confederacy's generals. He quarreled with General <a href="P.G.T.%20Beauregard">P.G.T. Beauregard</a>, a war hero since his victory at First Manassas. Beauregard sought to add a rocket battery to his command, an action Benjamin stated was not authorized by law. He was most likely relaying Davis's views, and when challenged by Beauregard, the president backed Benjamin, advising the general to "dismiss this small matter from your mind. In the hostile masses before you, you have a subject more worthy of your contemplation". In January 1862, <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Jackson">Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's</a> forces had advanced in western Virginia, leaving troops under <a href="William%20W.%20Loring">William W. Loring</a> at the small town of <a href="Romney%2C%20West%20Virginia">Romney</a>. Distant from Jackson's other forces and ill-supplied, Loring and other officers petitioned the War Department to be recalled, and Benjamin, after consulting Davis, so ordered, using the pretext of rumored Union troop movements in the area. Jackson complied, but in a letter to Benjamin asked to be removed from the front, or to resign. High-ranking Confederates soothed Jackson into withdrawing his request.

The power of state governments was another flaw in the Confederacy and a problem for Benjamin. Georgia Governor <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Brown">Joseph E. Brown</a> repeatedly demanded arms and the return of Georgian troops to defend their state. North Carolina's governor, <a href="Henry%20T.%20Clark">Henry T. Clark</a>, also wanted troops returned to him to defend his coastline. After <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras</a>, on North Carolina's coast, was captured, Confederate forces fell back to <a href="Roanoke%20Island">Roanoke Island</a>. If that fell, a number of ports in that area of the coast would be at risk, and <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, might be threatened by land.

General <a href="Henry%20A.%20Wise">Henry A. Wise</a>, commanding Roanoke, also demanded troops and supplies. He received little from Benjamin's War Department that had no arms to send, as the Union blockade was preventing supplies from being imported. That Confederate armories were empty was a fact not publicly known at the time. Benjamin and Davis hoped the island's defenses could hold off the Union forces, but an overwhelming number of troops were landed in February 1862 at an undefended point, and the Confederates <a href="Battle%20of%20Roanoke%20Island">were quickly defeated</a>. Combined with Union General <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s capture of <a href="Fort%20Henry%20%28site%20of%20the%20Battle%20of%20Fort%20Henry%29">Fort Henry</a> and <a href="Fort%20Donelson">Fort Donelson</a> in Tennessee, this was the most severe military blow yet to the Confederacy, and there was a public outcry against Benjamin, led by General Wise.

It was revealed, a quarter century after the war, that Benjamin and Davis had agreed for the secretary to act as scapegoat rather than reveal the shortage of arms. Not knowing this, the <a href="Richmond%20Examiner">Richmond "Examiner"</a> accused Benjamin of "stupid complacency". Diarist <a href="Mary%20Chestnut">Mary Chestnut</a> recorded, "the mob calls him Mr. Davis's pet Jew". The Wise family never forgave Benjamin, to the detriment of his memory in Southern eyes. The general's son, Captain Jennings Wise, fell at Roanoke Island, and Henry's grandson John Wise, interviewed in 1936, told Meade that "the fat Jew sitting at his desk" was to blame. Another of the general's sons, also named John Wise, wrote a highly popular book about the South in the Civil War, "The End of an Era" (1899), in which he said that Benjamin "had more brains and less heart than any other civic leader in the South ... The Confederacy and its collapse were no more to Judah P. Benjamin than last year's birds nest."

The <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Confederate Congress</a> established a special committee to investigate the military losses; Benjamin testified before it. The <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>, Virginia's <a href="Robert%20M.%20T.%20Hunter">Robert M. T. Hunter</a>, had quarreled with Davis and resigned and in March 1862, Benjamin was appointed as his replacement. Varina Davis noted that some in Congress had sought Benjamin's ouster "because of reverses which no one could have averted, [so] the President promoted him to the State Department with a personal and aggrieved sense of injustice done to the man who had now become his friend and right hand." Richmond diarist <a href="Sallie%20Ann%20Brock%20Putnam">Sallie Ann Brock Putnam</a> wrote, "Mr. Benjamin was not forgiven ... this act on the part of the President [in promoting Benjamin], in defiance of public opinion, was considered as unwise, arbitrary, and a reckless risking of his reputation and popularity ... [Benjamin] was ever afterwards unpopular in the Confederacy, and particularly in Virginia". Despite the promotion, the committee reported that any blame for the defeat at Roanoke Island should attach to Wise's superior, Major General <a href="Benjamin%20Huger%20%28general%29">Benjamin Huger</a>, "and the late secretary of war, J.P. Benjamin".

Throughout his time as Secretary of State, Benjamin tried to induce Britain and France to recognize the Confederacy—no other nation was likely to do so unless these powerful states led the way. The protection this would bring to the Confederacy and its foreign trade was hoped to be enough to save it.

By the 1850s, cheap Southern cotton fueled the industries of Europe. The mills of Britain, developed during the first half of the 19th century, by 1860 used more cotton than the rest of the industrialized world combined. Cotton imports to Britain came almost entirely from the American South. According to an article in "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>" in 1853, "let any great social or physical convulsion visit the United States, and England would feel the shock from Land's End to John O'Groat's. The lives of nearly two million of our countrymen ... hang upon a thread."

In 1855, an Ohioan, David Christy, published "Cotton Is King: or Slavery in the Light of Political Economy". Christy argued that the flow of cotton was so important to the industrialized world that cutting it off would be devastating—not least to the Northern United States, as cotton was by far the largest U.S. export. This became known as the "<a href="King%20Cotton">King Cotton</a>" theory, to which Davis was an enthusiastic subscriber. Benjamin also spoke in favor of the theory, though Butler suspected he may have "known better", based on his firsthand knowledge of Europe.

When war came, Davis, against Benjamin's advice, imposed an embargo on exports of cotton to nations that had not recognized the Confederate government, hoping to force such relations, especially with Britain and France. As the Union was attempting to prevent cotton from being exported from Confederate ports by a blockade and other means, this played to a certain extent into the hands of Lincoln and his Secretary of State, <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a>. Additionally, when the war began, Britain had a large surplus of cotton in warehouses, enough to keep the mills running at least part-time for a year or so. Although many prominent Britons believed the South would prevail, there was a reluctance to recognize Richmond until it had gained the military victories to put its foe at bay. Much of this was due to hatred of slavery, though part of it stemmed from a desire to remain on good terms with the U.S. government—due to a drought in 1862, Britain was forced to import large quantities of wheat and flour from the United States. Also, Britain feared the expansionist Americans might invade the vulnerable Canadian colonies, as Seward hinted they might.

Davis appointed Benjamin as Secretary of State on March 17, 1862. He was promptly confirmed by the Confederate Senate. A motion to reconsider the confirmation was lost, 13–8. According to Butler, the appointment of Benjamin brought Davis little political support, as the average white Southerner did not understand Benjamin and somewhat disliked him. As there was not much open opposition to Davis in the South at the time, Benjamin's appointment was not criticized, but was not given much praise either. Meade noted, "the silence of many influential newspapers was ominous. [Benjamin's] promotion in the face of such bitter criticism of his conduct in the war office caused the first serious lack of confidence in the Davis government."

Meade wrote that, since the Secretary of State would have to work closely with Jefferson Davis, Benjamin was likely the person best suited to the position. In addition to his relationship with the President, Benjamin was very close to the Confederate First Lady, Varina Davis, with whom he exchanged confidences regarding war events and the President's health. "Together, and by turns, they could help him over the most difficult days."

For recreation, Benjamin frequented Richmond's gambling dens, playing poker and <a href="faro%20%28card%20game%29">faro</a>. He was incensed when British correspondent <a href="William%20Howard%20Russell">William Howard Russell</a> publicized his gambling, feeling that it was an invasion of his private affairs. He was also displeased that Russell depicted him as a losing gambler, when his reputation was the opposite.

The <a href="Trent%20Affair">"Trent" Affair</a> had taken place before Benjamin took office as Secretary of State: a U.S. warship had in October 1861 removed Confederate diplomats <a href="James%20Murray%20Mason">James Mason</a> and James Slidell (Benjamin's former Louisiana colleague in the U.S. Senate) and their private secretaries from a British-flagged vessel. The crisis brought the U.S. and Britain near war, and was resolved by their release. By the time of Benjamin's appointment, Mason and Slidell were at their posts in London and Paris as putative ministers from the Confederacy, seeking recognition by the governments of Britain and France. With difficult communications between the South and Europe (dispatches were often lost or intercepted), Benjamin was initially reluctant to change the instructions given the agents by Secretary Hunter. Communications improved by 1863, with Benjamin ordering that dispatches be sent to Bermuda or the Bahamas, from where they reached the Confederacy by <a href="Blockade%20runners%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">blockade runner</a>.

As a practical matter, Benjamin's chances of gaining European recognition rose and fell with the military fortunes of the Confederacy. When, at the end of June 1862, Confederate General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> turned back Union General <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a>'s <a href="Peninsula%20Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a> in the <a href="Seven%20Days%20Battles">Seven Days Battles</a>, ending the immediate threat to Richmond, Emperor <a href="Napoleon%20III%20of%20France">Napoleon III of France</a> favorably received proposals from Benjamin, through Slidell, for the French to intervene on the Confederacy's behalf in exchange for trade concessions. Nevertheless, the Emperor proved unwilling to act without Britain. In August 1862, Mason, angered by the refusal of British government ministers to meet with him, threatened to resign his post. Benjamin soothed him, stating that while Mason should not submit to insulting treatment, resignation should not take place without discussion.

The bloody standoff at <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Antietam</a> in September 1862 that ended Lee's first major incursion into the North gave Lincoln the confidence in Union arms he needed to announce the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>. British newspapers mocked Lincoln for hypocrisy in freeing slaves only in Confederate-held areas, where he could exercise no authority. British officials had been shocked by the outcome of Antietam—they had expected Lee to deliver another brilliant victory—and now considered an additional reason for intervening in the conflict. Antietam, the bloodiest day of the war, had been a stalemate; they read this as presaging an overall deadlock in the war, with North and South at each other's throats for years as Britain's mills sat empty and its people starved. France agreed with this assessment.

The final few months of 1862 saw a high water mark for Benjamin's diplomacy. In October, the British <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a href="William%20Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, expressed confidence in Confederate victory, stating in Newcastle, "There is no doubt that Jefferson Davis and other leaders of the South have made an army. They are making, it appears, a navy, and they have made what is more than either—they have made a nation." Later that month, Napoleon proposed to the British and Russians (a U.S. ally) that they combine to require a six months' armistice for mediation, and an end to the blockade; if they did so, it would likely lead to Southern independence. The proposal divided the British Cabinet. In mid-November, at the urgings of Palmerston and <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">War Secretary</a> <a href="Sir%20George%20Cornewall%20Lewis%2C%202nd%20Baronet">George Cornewall Lewis</a>, members decided to continue to wait for the South to defeat Lincoln's forces before recognizing it. Although proponents of intervention were prepared to await another opportunity, growing realization among the British public that the Emancipation Proclamation meant that Union victory would be slavery's end made succoring the South politically infeasible.

Benjamin had not been allowed to offer the inducement for intervention that might have succeeded—abolition of slavery in the Confederacy, and because of that, Meade deemed his diplomacy "seriously, perhaps fatally handicapped". The Secretary of State blamed Napoleon for the failure, believing the Emperor had betrayed the Confederacy to get the ruler the French had installed in Mexico, <a href="Maximilian%20I%20of%20Mexico">Maximilian</a>, accepted by the United States.

In Paris, Slidell had been approached by the banking firm <a href="Emile%20Erlanger%20and%20Company">Erlanger et Cie</a>. The company offered to float a loan to benefit the Confederacy. The proposed terms provided a large commission to Erlanger and would entitle the bondholder to cotton at a discounted price once the South won the war. Baron <a href="Frederic%20Emile%20d%27Erlanger">Frederic Emile d'Erlanger</a>, head of the firm, journeyed to Richmond in early 1863, and negotiated with Benjamin, although the transaction properly fell within the jurisdiction of Treasury Secretary Memminger. The banker softened the terms somewhat, though they were still lucrative for his firm. Benjamin felt the deal was worth it, as it would provide the Confederacy with badly needed funds to pay its agents in Europe.

The twin rebel defeats at <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Gettysburg</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Vicksburg">Vicksburg</a> in early July 1863 made it unlikely that Britain, or any other nation, would recognize a slaveholding Confederacy staggering towards oblivion. Accordingly, in August, Benjamin wrote to Mason telling him that as Davis believed the British unwilling to recognize the South, he was free to leave the country. In October, with Davis absent on a trip to Tennessee, Benjamin heard that the British consul in Savannah had forbidden British subjects in the Confederate Army from being used against the United States. The Secretary of State convened a Cabinet meeting, that expelled the remaining British consuls in Confederate-controlled territory, then notified Davis by letter. Evans suggests that Benjamin's actions made him the Confederacy's acting president—the first Jewish president.

Benjamin supervised the <a href="Confederate%20Secret%20Service">Confederate Secret Service</a>, responsible for covert operations in the North, and financed former federal Interior Secretary <a href="Jacob%20Thompson">Jacob Thompson</a> to work behind the scenes financing operations that might undermine Lincoln politically. Although efforts were made to boost <a href="Peace%20Democrats">Peace Democrats</a>, the most prominent actions proved to be the <a href="St.%20Albans%20Raid">St. Albans Raid</a> (an attack on a Vermont town from Canada) and an unsuccessful attempt to burn New York City. In the aftermath of the war, these activities led to accusations that Benjamin and Davis were involved in the <a href="assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">assassination of Abraham Lincoln</a>, as one Confederate courier, <a href="John%20H.%20Surratt">John H. Surratt</a>, who had received money from Benjamin, was tried for involvement in the conspiracy, though Surratt was acquitted.

As the Confederacy's military fortunes flagged, there was increasing consideration of what would have been unthinkable in 1861—enlisting male slaves in the army and emancipating them for their service. In August 1863, B. H. Micou, a relative of a former law partner, wrote to Benjamin proposing the use of black soldiers. Benjamin responded that this was not feasible, principally for legal and financial reasons, and that the slaves were performing valuable services for the Confederacy where they were. According to Meade, "Benjamin did not offer any objections to Micou's plan except on practical grounds—he was not repelled by the radical nature of the proposal". A British financial agent for the Confederacy, James Spence, also urged emancipation as a means of gaining British recognition. Benjamin allowed Spence to remain in his position for almost a year despite the differences with Confederate policy, before finally dismissing him in late 1863. Despite official neutrality, tens of thousands from British-ruled Ireland were enlisting in the Union cause; Benjamin sent an agent to Ireland hoping to impede those efforts and <a href="Dudley%20Mann">Dudley Mann</a> to Rome to urge <a href="Pope%20Pius%20IX">Pope Pius IX</a> to forbid Catholic Irish from enlisting. The Pope did not do so, though he responded sympathetically.

In January 1864, Confederate General <a href="Patrick%20Cleburne">Patrick Cleburne</a>, of the <a href="Army%20of%20Tennessee">Army of Tennessee</a>, proposed emancipating and arming the slaves. Davis, when he heard of it, turned it down and ordered it kept secret. Evans notes that Benjamin "had been thinking in similar terms for much longer, and perhaps the recommendation of so respected an officer was just the impetus he needed." The year 1864 was a disastrous one for the Confederacy, with Lee forced <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">within siege lines</a> at Petersburg and Union General <a href="William%20T.%20Sherman">William T. Sherman</a> <a href="Burning%20of%20Atlanta">sacking Atlanta</a> and devastating Georgia on <a href="Sherman%27s%20March%20to%20the%20Sea">his march to the sea</a>. Benjamin urged Davis to send the secretary's fellow Louisianan, <a href="Duncan%20Kenner">Duncan Kenner</a>, to Paris and London, with an offer of emancipation in exchange for recognition. Davis was only willing to offer gradual emancipation, and both Napoleon and Palmerston rejected the proposal. Benjamin continued to press the matter, addressing a mass meeting in Richmond in February 1865 in support of arming the slaves and emancipating them. A bill eventually emerged from the Confederate Congress in March, but it had many restrictions, and it was too late to affect the outcome of the war.

In January 1865, Lincoln, who had been re-elected the previous November, sent <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair">Francis Blair</a> as an emissary to Richmond, hoping to secure reunion without further bloodshed. Both sides agreed to a meeting at <a href="Fort%20Monroe">Fort Monroe</a>, Virginia. Benjamin drafted vague instructions for the Southern delegation, led by Vice President <a href="Alexander%20Stephens">Alexander Stephens</a>, but Davis insisted on modifying them to refer to North and South as "two nations". This was the point that scuttled the <a href="Hampton%20Roads%20Conference">Hampton Roads Conference</a>; Lincoln would not consider the South a separate entity, insisting on union and emancipation.

By March 1865, the Confederate military situation was desperate. Most major population centers had fallen, and General Lee's defense of Richmond was faltering against massive Union forces. Nevertheless, Benjamin retained his usual good humor; on the evening of April 1, with evacuation likely, he was at the State Department offices, singing a silly ballad of his own composition, "The Exit from Shocko Hill", <a href="Shockoe%20Hill">a graveyard district</a> located in Richmond. On April 2, Lee sent word that he could only keep Union troops away from the line of the <a href="Richmond%20and%20Danville%20Railroad">Richmond and Danville Railroad</a> for a short time. Those who did not leave Richmond would be trapped. At 11:00 pm that night, the Confederate President and Cabinet left aboard a <a href="Danville%2C%20Virginia">Danville</a>-bound train. Navy Secretary <a href="Stephen%20R.%20Mallory">Stephen R. Mallory</a> recorded that Benjamin's "hope and good humor [was] inexhaustible ... with a 'never-give-up-the-ship' sort of air, referred to other great national causes which had been redeemed from far gloomier reverses than ours".

In Danville, Benjamin shared a room with another refugee, in the home of a banker. For a week, Danville served as capital of the Confederacy, until word came of Lee's <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Court%20House%23Surrender">surrender at Appomattox Court House</a>. With no army to shield the Confederate government, it would be captured by Union forces within days, so Davis and his Cabinet, including Benjamin, fled south to <a href="Greensboro%2C%20North%20Carolina">Greensboro, North Carolina</a>. Five minutes after the train passed over the <a href="Haw%20River">Haw River</a>, Union cavalry raiders burned the bridge, trapping the trains that followed Davis's.

Greensboro, fearing wrathful reprisal from the Union, gave the fugitives little hospitality, forcing Benjamin and the other Cabinet members to bunk in a railroad boxcar. Davis hoped to reach Texas, where rumor had it large Confederate forces remained active. The Cabinet met in Greensboro, and Generals Beauregard and <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> sketched the bleak military situation. Davis, backed as usual by Benjamin, was determined to continue to fight. The refugee government moved south on April 15. With the train tracks cut, most Cabinet members rode on horseback, but the heavyset Benjamin declared he would not ride on one until he had to, and shared an ambulance with Jules St. Martin and others. For the entertainment of his companions, Benjamin recited <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Tennyson's</a> "Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington".

In Charlotte, Benjamin stayed in the home of a Jewish merchant as surrender negotiations dragged. Here, Benjamin abandoned Davis's plan to fight on, telling him and the Cabinet that the cause was hopeless. When negotiations failed, Benjamin was part of the shrunken remnant of associates that moved on with Davis. The party reached <a href="Abbeville%2C%20South%20Carolina">Abbeville, South Carolina</a> on May 2, and Benjamin told Davis that he wanted to separate from the presidential party temporarily, and go to the Bahamas to be able to send instructions to foreign agents before rejoining Davis in Texas. According to historian William C. Davis, "the pragmatic Secretary of State almost certainly never had any intention of returning to the South once gone". When he bade <a href="John%20Reagan">John Reagan</a> goodbye, the postmaster general asked where Benjamin was going. "To the farthest place from the United States, if it takes me to the middle of China."

With one companion, Benjamin travelled south in a poor carriage, pretending to be a Frenchman who spoke no English. He had some gold with him, and left much of it for the support of relatives. He was traveling in the same general direction as the Davis party, but evaded capture whereas Davis was taken by Union troops. Benjamin reached <a href="Monticello%2C%20Florida">Monticello, Florida</a>, on May 13 to learn Union troops were in nearby <a href="Madison%2C%20Florida">Madison</a>. Benjamin decided to continue alone on horseback, east and south along Florida's Gulf Coast, pretending to be a South Carolina farmer. <a href="John%20T.%20Lesley">John T. Lesley</a>, <a href="James%20McKay%20Sr.">James McKay</a>, and <a href="Charles%20James%20Munnerlyn">C. J. Munnerlyn</a> assisted in hiding Benjamin in a swamp, before eventually transporting him to <a href="Gamble%20Plantation%20Historic%20State%20Park">Gamble Mansion</a> in <a href="Ellenton%2C%20Florida">Ellenton</a>, on the southwest coast of Florida. From there, assisted by the blockade runner Captain Archibald McNeill, he reached <a href="Bimini">Bimini</a> in the Bahamas. His escape from Florida to England was not without hardship: at one point he pretended to be a Jewish cook on McNeill's vessel, to deceive American soldiers who inspected it—one of whom stated it was the first time he had seen a Jew do menial labor. The small sponge-carrying vessel on which he left Bimini bound for <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a> exploded on the way, and he and the three black crewmen eventually managed to return to Bimini. McNeill's ship was still there, and he chartered it to take him to Nassau. From there, he took a ship for Havana, and on August 6, 1865, left there for Britain. He was not yet done with disaster; his ship caught fire after departing <a href="Saint%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">St. Thomas</a>, and the crew put out the flames only with difficulty. On August 30, 1865, Judah Benjamin arrived at <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, in Britain.

Benjamin spent a week in London assisting Mason in winding up Confederate affairs. He then went to Paris to visit his wife and daughter for the first time since before the war. Friends in Paris urged him to join a mercantile firm there, but Benjamin felt that such a career would be subject to interference by Seward and the United States. Accordingly, Benjamin sought to shape his old course in a new country, resuming his legal career as an English <a href="Barristers%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">barrister</a>. Most of Benjamin's property had been destroyed or confiscated, and he needed to make a living for himself and his relatives. He had money in the United Kingdom as he had, during the war, purchased cotton for transport to <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> by blockade runner.

On January 13, 1866, Benjamin enrolled at <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a>, and soon thereafter was admitted to read law under Charles Pollock, son of <a href="Baron%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chief Baron</a> <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Pollock">Charles Edward Pollock</a>, who took him as a pupil at his father's direction. Benjamin, despite his age of 54, was initially required, like his thirty-years-younger peers, to attend for twelve terms, that is, three years. According to Benjamin's obituary in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", though, "the secretary of the Confederacy was dispensed from the regular three years of unprofitable dining, and called to the bar" on June 6, 1866.

Once qualified as a barrister, Benjamin chose to join the <a href="Northern%20Circuit">Northern Circuit</a>, as it included Liverpool, where his connections in New Orleans and knowledge of mercantile affairs would do him the most good. In an early case, he defended two former Confederate agents against a suit by the United States to gain assets said to belong to that nation. Although he lost that case ("United States v Wagner") on appeal, he was successful against his former enemies in "United States v McRae" (1869). He had need of rapid success, as most of his remaining assets were lost in the collapse of the firm of <a href="Overend%2C%20Gurney%20and%20Company">Overend, Gurney and Company</a>. He was reduced to penning columns on international affairs for "<a href="The%20Telegraph%20%28UK%29">The Daily Telegraph</a>".

According to Justice <a href="Ruth%20Bader%20Ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, "repeating his Louisiana progress, Benjamin made his reputation among his new peers by publication". In an early representation, he wrote a complex governing document for an insurance firm that other counsel had declined despite the substantial fee, due to the early deadline. After brief study, Benjamin wrote out the document, never making a correction or erasure. In 1868, Benjamin published "A Treatise on the Law of Sale of Personal Property, With Reference to the American Decisions, to the French Code, and Civil Law". This work, known for short as "Benjamin on Sales", became a classic in both Britain and America, and launched his career as a barrister. It went through three editions prior to Benjamin's death in 1884; an eighth edition was published in 2010. Today "Benjamin's Sale of Goods" forms part of the "common law library" of key practitioner texts on English civil law.

In 1867, Benjamin had been indicted in Richmond, along with Davis, Lee, and others, for waging war against the United States. The indictment was soon quashed. Davis visited London in 1868, free on bail, and Benjamin advised him not to take legal action against the author of a book that had angered Davis, as it would only give the book publicity. Benjamin corresponded with Davis, and met with him on the former rebel president's visits to Europe during Benjamin's lifetime, though the two were never as close as they had been during the war.

Benjamin was created a "Palatine silk", entitled to the precedence of a <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">Queen's Counsel</a> within <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, in July 1869. There was a large creation of Queen's Counsel in early 1872, but Benjamin was not included; it was stated in his "Times" obituary that he had put his name forward. Later that year, he argued the case of "Potter v Rankin" before the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> and so impressed <a href="William%20Wood%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hatherley">Lord Hatherley</a> that a <a href="patent%20of%20precedence">patent of precedence</a> was soon made out, giving Benjamin the privileges of a Queen's Counsel. As he became prominent as a barrister, he discontinued practice before juries (at which he was less successful) in favor of trials or appeals before judges. In his last years in practice, he demanded an additional fee of 100 guineas (£105) to appear in any court besides the House of Lords and the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a>. In 1875, he was made a <a href="bencher">bencher</a> of Lincoln's Inn.

In 1881, Benjamin represented Arthur Orton, the <a href="Tichborne%20case">Tichborne claimant</a>, before the House of Lords. Orton, a butcher from <a href="Wagga%20Wagga">Wagga Wagga</a>, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, had claimed to be Sir Roger Tichborne, a <a href="baronet">baronet</a> who had vanished some years previously, and Orton had perjured himself in the course of defending his claim. Benjamin sought to overturn the sentence of 14 years passed on Orton, but was not successful.
In his final years, Benjamin suffered from health issues. In 1880, he was badly injured in a fall from a tram in Paris. He also developed diabetes. He suffered a heart attack in Paris at the end of 1882, and his doctor ordered him to retire. His health improved enough to allow him to travel to London in June 1883 for a dinner in his honor attended by the English bench and bar. He returned to Paris and suffered a relapse of his heart trouble in early 1884. Natalie Benjamin had the <a href="last%20rites">last rites</a> of the Catholic Church administered to her Jewish husband before his death in Paris on May 6, 1884, and funeral services were held in a church prior to Judah Benjamin's interment at <a href="P%C3%A8re%20Lachaise%20Cemetery">Père Lachaise Cemetery</a> in the St. Martin family crypt. His grave did not bear his name until 1938, when a plaque was placed by the Paris chapter of the <a href="United%20Daughters%20of%20the%20Confederacy">United Daughters of the Confederacy</a>.

Benjamin was the first U.S. senator to profess the Jewish faith. In 1845, <a href="David%20Yulee">David Yulee</a>, born David Levy, had been sworn in for Florida, but he renounced Judaism and eventually formally converted to Christianity. As an adult, Benjamin was a nonobservant Jew, who was not a member of a synagogue and took no part in communal affairs. He rarely spoke of his religion publicly, but was not ashamed of it. Some of the stories told of Benjamin that touch on his faith come from Rabbi <a href="Isaac%20Mayer%20Wise">Isaac Mayer Wise</a>, who related that Benjamin delivered an address in a San Francisco synagogue on <a href="Yom%20Kippur">Yom Kippur</a> in 1860, though whether this occurred is open to question as Wise was not there and it was not reported in the city's Jewish newspaper. One quote from Senate debate that remains "part of the Benjamin legend", according to Evans, followed an allusion to Moses as a freer of slaves by a Northern senator, hinting that Benjamin was an "Israelite in Egyptian clothing". Benjamin is supposed to have replied, "It is true that I am a Jew, and when my ancestors were receiving their Ten Commandments from the immediate hand of deity, amidst the thunderings and lightnings of Mount Sinai, the ancestors of my opponent were herding swine in the forests of Great Britain."

Edgar M. Kahn, in his journal article on the 1860 California sojourn, wrote, "Benjamin's life is an example of a man's determination to overcome almost insurmountable barriers by industry, perseverance, and intelligent use of a remarkable brain." This brilliance was recognized by contemporaries; <a href="Salomon%20James%20de%20Rothschild">Salomon de Rothschild</a>, in 1861, deemed Benjamin "the greatest mind" in North America. Nevertheless, according to Meade, "he was given to quixotic enthusiasms and was sometimes too cocksure of his knowledge." Ginsburg said of Benjamin, "he rose to the top of the legal profession twice in one lifetime, on two continents, beginning his first ascent as a raw youth and his second as a fugitive minister of a vanquished power." Davis, after Benjamin's death, deemed him the most able member of his Cabinet, and said that the lawyer's postwar career had fully vindicated his confidence in him.
According to Brook, "in every age, a heroic sage struggles to rescue Benjamin from obscurity—and invariably fails." Benjamin left no memoir and destroyed his personal papers, by which "the task of future researchers and historians was made exceedingly difficult and laborious". After his death, Benjamin was rarely written about, in contrast to Davis and other Confederate leaders. Part of this was due to Benjamin depriving his potential biographers of source material, but even Davis, in his two-volume war memoir, mentions him only twice. Evans suggests that as Davis wrote the books in part to defend and memorialize his place in history, it would not have been characteristic of him to give much credit to Benjamin. Davis, in the midst of postwar business struggles, may have resented Benjamin's success as a barrister, or may have feared that allegations of involvement in Lincoln's assassination would again be made against the two men. Brook concurs that Benjamin's postwar success, that began as Davis lay in prison and other Confederates struggled for survival, may have soured Southerners towards the former secretary, but that anti-Semitism was also likely a factor. "For the guardians of Confederate memory after Reconstruction, Benjamin became a kind of pet Jew, generally ignored, but then trotted out at opportune moments to defend the segregated South against charges of bigotry."

Those writing on Jewish history were reluctant to glorify a slaveowner, and reacted to Benjamin's story with "embarrassed dismay". This was especially so in the two generations following 1865, when the question of the Civil War remained an active issue in American politics. It was not until the 1930s that Benjamin began to be mentioned as a significant figure in the history of the United States, and in the chronicle of the Jews there. Nevertheless, Tom Mountain, in his 2009 article on Benjamin, points out that Benjamin was respected in the South as a leader of the rebel cause for a century after the Civil War, and that Southern schoolchildren who could not name the current Secretary of State in Washington knew about Benjamin. Reform Rabbi Daniel Polish noted in 1988 that Benjamin "represent[ed] a significant dilemma [in] my years growing up as a Jew both proud of his people and with an intense commitment to the ideals of liberalism and human solidarity that I found embodied in the civil rights movement."

Berman recounts a story that during the Civil War, Benjamin was <a href="Aliyah%20%28Torah%29">called to the Torah</a> at Beth Ahabah synagogue in Richmond. However, there is no proof of this, nor does Benjamin's name appear in any surviving record of the Jews of that city. "But whether or not Benjamin practiced Judaism overtly or contributed to Jewish causes, to the Jews of the South, he was a symbol of a coreligionist who was a man among men". According to Evans, "Benjamin survives, as he willed it: a shadowy figure in Civil War history". Kahn noted that Benjamin "is epitomized as a foremost orator, lawyer, and statesman, without a peer at the bars of two of the world's greatest nations". Meade questioned whether Benjamin's character can ever be fully understood:

Colley Cibber

Colley Cibber (6 November 1671 – 11 December 1757) was an English <a href="actor-manager">actor-manager</a>, playwright and <a href="Poet%20laureate%23British%20Poets%20Laureate">Poet Laureate</a>. His colourful memoir "Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber" (1740) describes his life in a personal, anecdotal and even rambling style. He wrote 25 plays for his own company at <a href="Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a>, half of which were adapted from various sources, which led Robert Lowe and <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>, among others, to criticise his "miserable mutilation" of "crucified <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a> [and] hapless <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>". He regarded himself as first and foremost an actor and had great popular success in comical <a href="fop">fop</a> parts, while as a tragic actor he was persistent but much ridiculed. Cibber's brash, extroverted personality did not sit well with his contemporaries, and he was frequently accused of tasteless theatrical productions, shady business methods, and a social and political opportunism that was thought to have gained him the laureateship over far better poets. He rose to ignominious fame when he became the chief target, the head Dunce, of Alexander Pope's satirical poem "<a href="The%20Dunciad">The Dunciad</a>".

Cibber's poetical work was derided in his time, and has been remembered only for being poor. His importance in British theatre history rests on his being one of the first in a long line of actor-managers, on the interest of two of his comedies as documents of evolving early 18th-century taste and ideology, and on the value of his autobiography as a historical source.

Cibber was born in Southampton Street, in <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>, London. He was the eldest child of <a href="Caius%20Gabriel%20Cibber">Caius Gabriel Cibber</a>, a distinguished sculptor originally from Denmark. His mother, Jane née Colley, came from a family of <a href="gentry">gentry</a> from <a href="Glaston">Glaston</a>, <a href="Rutland">Rutland</a>. He was educated at <a href="the%20King%27s%20School%2C%20Grantham">the King's School, Grantham</a>, from 1682 until the age of 16, but failed to win a place at <a href="Winchester%20College">Winchester College</a>, which had been founded by his maternal ancestor <a href="William%20of%20Wykeham">William of Wykeham</a>. In 1688, he joined the service of his father's patron, <a href="William%20Cavendish%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Devonshire">Lord Devonshire</a>, who was one of the prime supporters of the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>. After the revolution, and at a loose end in London, he was attracted to the stage and in 1690 began work as an actor in <a href="Thomas%20Betterton">Thomas Betterton</a>'s <a href="United%20Company">United Company</a> at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane Theatre</a>. "Poor, at odds with his parents, and entering the theatrical world at a time when players were losing their power to businessmen-managers", on 6 May 1693 Cibber married <a href="Catherine%20Ciber">Katherine Shore</a>, the daughter of Matthias Shore, sergeant-trumpeter to the King, despite his poor prospects and insecure, socially inferior job.

Cibber and Katherine had 12 children between 1694 and 1713. Six died in infancy, and most of the surviving children received short shrift in his will. Catherine, the eldest surviving daughter, married Colonel James Brown and seems to have been the dutiful one who looked after Cibber in old age following his wife's death in 1734. She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares and foods, and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near <a href="Gray%27s%20Inn">Gray's Inn</a>, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett's death) Joseph Marples. His only son to reach adulthood, <a href="Theophilus%20Cibber">Theophilus</a>, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was an embarrassment to his father because of his scandalous private life. His other son to survive infancy, James, died in or after 1717 before reaching adulthood. Colley's youngest daughter <a href="Charlotte%20Charke">Charlotte</a> followed in her father's theatrical footsteps, but she fell out with him and her sister Catherine, and she was cut off by the family.

After an inauspicious start as an actor, Cibber eventually became a popular comedian, wrote and adapted many plays, and rose to become one of the newly empowered businessmen-managers. He took over the management of Drury Lane in 1710 and took a highly commercial, if not artistically successful, line in the job. In 1730, he was made <a href="Poet%20Laureate">Poet Laureate</a>, an appointment which attracted widespread scorn, particularly from <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a> and other <a href="Tory">Tory</a> satirists. Off-stage, he was a keen gambler, and was one of the investors in the <a href="South%20Sea%20Company">South Sea Company</a>.

In the last two decades of his life, Cibber remained prominent in society, and summered in <a href="Georgian%20era">Georgian</a> <a href="spa">spa</a>s such as <a href="Tunbridge%20Wells">Tunbridge</a>, <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a> and <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>. He was friendly with the writer <a href="Samuel%20Richardson">Samuel Richardson</a>, the actress <a href="Margaret%20Woffington">Margaret Woffington</a> and the memoirist–poet <a href="Laetitia%20Pilkington">Laetitia Pilkington</a>. Aged 73 in 1745, he made his last appearance on the stage as Pandulph in his own "deservedly unsuccessful" "Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John". In 1750, he fell seriously ill and recommended his friend and protégé <a href="Henry%20Jones%20%28poet%29">Henry Jones</a> as the next Poet Laureate. Cibber recovered and Jones passed into obscurity. Cibber died suddenly at his house in <a href="Berkeley%20Square">Berkeley Square</a>, London, in December 1757, leaving small pecuniary legacies to four of his five surviving children, £1,000 each (the equivalent of approximately £180,000 in 2011) to his granddaughters Jane and Elizabeth (the daughters of Theophilus), and the residue of his estate to his eldest daughter Catherine. He was buried on 18 December, probably at the <a href="Grosvenor%20Chapel">Grosvenor Chapel</a> on South Audley Street.

Cibber's colourful autobiography "An Apology for the Life of Colley Cibber, Comedian" (1740) was chatty, meandering, anecdotal, vain, and occasionally inaccurate. At the time of writing the word "apology" meant an "<a href="apologia">apologia</a>", a statement in defence of one's actions rather than a statement of regret for having transgressed.

The text virtually ignores his wife and family, but Cibber wrote in detail about his time in the theatre, especially his early years as a young actor at Drury Lane in the 1690s, giving a vivid account of the cut-throat theatre company rivalries and chicanery of the time, as well as providing pen portraits of the actors he knew. The "Apology" is vain and self-serving, as both his contemporaries and later commentators have pointed out, but it also serves as Cibber's rebuttal to his harshest critics, especially Pope. For the early part of Cibber's career, it is unreliable in respect of chronology and other hard facts, understandably, since it was written 50 years after the events, apparently without the help of a journal or notes. Nevertheless, it is an invaluable source for all aspects of the early 18th-century theatre in London, for which documentation is otherwise scanty. Because he worked with many actors from the early days of <a href="Restoration%20theatre">Restoration theatre</a>, such as <a href="Thomas%20Betterton">Thomas Betterton</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20Barry">Elizabeth Barry</a> at the end of their careers, and lived to see <a href="David%20Garrick">David Garrick</a> perform, he is a bridge between the earlier mannered and later more naturalistic styles of performance.

The "Apology" was a popular work and gave Cibber a good return. Its self-complacency, however, infuriated some of his contemporaries, notably Pope, but even the usually critical <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> admitted it was "very entertaining and very well done". It went through four editions in his lifetime, and more after his death, and generations of readers have found it an amusing and engaging read, projecting an author always "happy in his own good opinion, the best of all others; teeming with animal spirits, and uniting the self-sufficiency of youth with the garrulity of age."
Cibber began his career as an actor at Drury Lane in 1690, and had little success for several years. "The first Thing that enters into the Head of a young Actor", he wrote in his autobiography half a century later, "is that of being a Hero: In this Ambition I was soon snubb'd by the Insufficiency of my Voice; to which might be added an uninform'd meagre Person ... with a dismal pale Complexion. Under these Disadvantages, I had but a melancholy Prospect of ever playing a Lover with <a href="Anne%20Bracegirdle">Mrs. Bracegirdle</a>, which I had flatter'd my Hopes that my Youth might one Day have recommended me to."
At this time the London stage was in something of a slump after the glories of the early <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a> period. The <a href="King%27s%20Company">King's</a> and <a href="Duke%27s%20Company">Duke's companies</a> had merged into a monopoly, leaving actors in a weak negotiating position and much at the mercy of the dictatorial manager <a href="Christopher%20Rich%20%28theatre%20manager%29">Christopher Rich</a>. When the senior actors rebelled and established a cooperative company of their own in 1695, Cibber—"wisely", as the "Biographical Dictionary of Actors" puts it—stayed with the remnants of the old company, "where the competition was less keen". After five years, he had still not seen significant success in his chosen profession, and there had been no heroic parts and no love scenes. However, the return of two-company rivalry created a sudden demand for new plays, and Cibber seized this opportunity to launch his career by writing a comedy with a big, flamboyant part for himself to play. He scored a double triumph: his comedy "<a href="Love%27s%20Last%20Shift">Love's Last Shift, or The Fool in Fashion</a>" (1696) was a great success, and his own uninhibited performance as the Frenchified <a href="fop">fop</a> Sir Novelty Fashion ("a coxcomb that loves to be the first in all foppery") delighted the audiences. His name was made, both as playwright and as comedian.

Later in life, when Cibber himself had the last word in casting at Drury Lane, he wrote, or patched together, several <a href="tragedies">tragedies</a> that were tailored to fit his continuing hankering after playing "a Hero". However, his performances of such parts never pleased audiences, which wanted to see him typecast as an affected fop, a kind of character that fitted both his private reputation as a vain man, his exaggerated, mannered style of acting, and his habit of ad libbing. His most famous part for the rest of his career remained that of Lord Foppington in "<a href="The%20Relapse">The Relapse</a>", a sequel to Cibber's own "Love's Last Shift" but written by <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>, first performed in 1696 with Cibber reprising his performance as Sir Novelty Fashion in the newly ennobled guise of Lord Foppington. Pope mentions the audience jubilation that greeted the small-framed Cibber donning Lord Foppington's enormous wig, which would be ceremoniously carried on stage in its own <a href="sedan%20chair">sedan chair</a>. Vanbrugh reputedly wrote the part of Lord Foppington deliberately "to suit the eccentricities of Cibber's acting style".

His tragic efforts, however, were consistently ridiculed by contemporaries: when Cibber in the role of <a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a> made love to Lady Anne, the "<a href="Grub%20Street%20Journal">Grub Street Journal</a>" wrote, "he looks like a pickpocket, with his shrugs and grimaces, that has more a design on her purse than her heart". Cibber was on the stage in every year but two (1727 and 1731) between his debut in 1690 and his retirement in 1732, playing more than 100 parts in all in nearly 3,000 documented performances. After he had sold his interest in Drury Lane in 1733 and was a wealthy man in his sixties, he returned to the stage occasionally to play the classic fop parts of <a href="Restoration%20comedy">Restoration comedy</a> for which audiences appreciated him. His Lord Foppington in Vanbrugh's "The Relapse", Sir Courtly Nice in <a href="John%20Crowne">John Crowne</a>'s "Sir Courtly Nice", and Sir Fopling Flutter in <a href="George%20Etherege">George Etherege</a>'s "Man of Mode" were legendary. Critic John Hill in his 1775 work "The actor, or, A treatise on the art of playing", described Cibber as "the best Lord Foppington who ever appeared, was in real life (with all due respect be it spoken by one who loves him) something of the coxcomb". These were the kind of comic parts where Cibber's affectation and mannerism were desirable. In 1738–39, he played Shallow in Shakespeare's <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%202">Henry IV, Part 2</a> to critical acclaim, but his Richard III (in his own version of the play) was not well received. In the middle of the play, he whispered to fellow actor <a href="Benjamin%20Victor%20%28theatre%20manager%29">Benjamin Victor</a> that he wanted to go home, perhaps realising he was too old for the part and its physical demands. Cibber also essayed tragic parts in plays by Shakespeare, <a href="Ben%20Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>, <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a> and others, but with less success. By the end of his acting career, audiences were being entranced by the innovatively naturalistic acting of the rising star <a href="David%20Garrick">David Garrick</a>, who made his London debut in the title part in a production of Cibber's adaptation of "Richard III" in 1741. He returned to the stage for a final time in 1745 as Cardinal Pandulph in his play "Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John".

Cibber's comedy "Love's Last Shift" (1696) is an early herald of a massive shift in audience taste, away from the <a href="intellectualism">intellectualism</a> and sexual frankness of <a href="Restoration%20comedy">Restoration comedy</a> and towards the conservative certainties and gender-role backlash of exemplary or <a href="sentimental%20comedy">sentimental comedy</a>. According to Paul Parnell, "Love's Last Shift" illustrates Cibber's opportunism at a moment in time before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something for everybody into his first play, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness.

The central action of "<a href="Love%27s%20Last%20Shift">Love's Last Shift</a>" is a celebration of the power of a good woman, Amanda, to reform a <a href="rake%20%28character%29">rakish</a> husband, Loveless, by means of sweet patience and a daring bed-trick. She masquerades as a prostitute and seduces Loveless without being recognised, and then confronts him with logical argument. Since he enjoyed the night with her while taking her for a stranger, a wife can be as good in bed as an illicit mistress. Loveless is convinced and stricken, and a rich choreography of mutual kneelings, risings and prostrations follows, generated by Loveless' penitence and Amanda's "submissive eloquence". The première audience is said to have wept at this climactic scene. The play was a great box-office success and was for a time the talk of the town, in both a positive and a negative sense. Some contemporaries regarded it as moving and amusing, others as a sentimental tear-jerker, incongruously interspersed with sexually explicit Restoration comedy jokes and semi-nude bedroom scenes.

"Love's Last Shift" is today read mainly to gain a perspective on <a href="Vanbrugh">Vanbrugh</a>'s sequel "<a href="The%20Relapse">The Relapse</a>", which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at "Love's Last Shift" from the first, namely that it is a blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy "Woman's Wit" (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of his plays, even elided its name in the "Apology". It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy "Xerxes" (1699). Cibber reused parts of "Woman's Wit" for "The School Boy" (1702).

Perhaps partly because of the failure of his previous two plays, Cibber's next effort was an adaptation of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>". Neither Cibber's adaptations nor his own original plays have stood the test of time, and hardly any of them have been staged or reprinted after the early 18th century, but his popular adaptation of "Richard III" remained the standard stage version for 150 years. The American actor <a href="George%20Berrell">George Berrell</a> wrote in the 1870s that "Richard III" was:
"Richard III" was followed by another adaptation, the comedy, "Love Makes a Man", which was constructed by splicing together two plays by <a href="John%20Fletcher%20%28playwright%29">John Fletcher</a>: "<a href="The%20Elder%20Brother">The Elder Brother</a>" and "<a href="The%20Custom%20of%20the%20Country%20%28play%29">The Custom of the Country</a>". Cibber's confidence was apparently restored by the success of the two plays, and he returned to more original writing.

The comedy "The Careless Husband" (1704), generally considered to be Cibber's best play, is another example of the retrieval of a straying husband by means of outstanding wifely tact, this time in a more domestic and genteel register. The easy-going Sir Charles Easy is chronically unfaithful to his wife, seducing both <a href="Lady">ladies of quality</a> and his own female servants with insouciant charm. The turning point of the action, known as "the Steinkirk scene", comes when his wife finds him and a maidservant asleep together in a chair, "as close an approximation to actual adultery as could be presented on the 18th-century stage". His <a href="periwig">periwig</a> has fallen off, an obvious suggestion of intimacy and abandon, and an opening for Lady Easy's tact. <a href="Soliloquy">Soliloquizing</a> to herself about how sad it would be if he caught cold, she "takes a Steinkirk off her Neck, and lays it gently on his Head" (V.i.21). (A "steinkirk" was a loosely tied lace collar or scarf, named after the way the officers wore their <a href="cravat">cravat</a>s at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Steenkerque">Battle of Steenkirk</a> in 1692.) She steals away, Sir Charles wakes, notices the steinkirk on his head, marvels that his wife did not wake him and make a scene, and realises how wonderful she is. The Easys go on to have a reconciliation scene which is much more low-keyed and tasteful than that in "Love's Last Shift", without kneelings and risings, and with Lady Easy shrinking with feminine delicacy from the coarse subjects that Amanda had broached without blinking. Paul Parnell has analysed the manipulative nature of Lady Easy's lines in this exchange, showing how they are directed towards the sentimentalist's goal of "ecstatic self-approval".

"The Careless Husband" was a great success on the stage and remained a <a href="repertory">repertory</a> play throughout the 18th century. Although it has now joined "Love's Last Shift" as a forgotten curiosity, it kept a respectable critical reputation into the 20th century, coming in for serious discussion both as an interesting example of <a href="doublethink">doublethink</a>, and as somewhat morally or emotionally insightful. In 1929, the well-known critic <a href="F.%20W.%20Bateson">F. W. Bateson</a> described the play's psychology as "mature", "plausible", "subtle", "natural", and "affecting".

"The Lady's Last Stake" (1707) is a rather bad-tempered reply to critics of Lady Easy's wifely patience in "The Careless Husband". It was coldly received, and its main interest lies in the glimpse the prologue gives of angry reactions to "The Careless Husband", of which we would otherwise have known nothing (since all contemporary published reviews of "The Careless Husband" approve and endorse its message). Some, says Cibber sarcastically in the prologue, seem to think Lady Easy ought rather to have strangled her husband with her steinkirk:
Many of Cibber's plays, listed below, were hastily cobbled together from borrowings. Alexander Pope said Cibber's drastic adaptations and patchwork plays were stolen from "crucified Molière" and "hapless Shakespeare". "The Double Gallant" (1707) was constructed from <a href="William%20Burnaby%20%28playwright%29">Burnaby's</a> "The Reformed Wife" and "The Lady's Visiting Day", and <a href="Susanna%20Centlivre">Centlivre's</a> "Love at a Venture". In the words of Leonard R. N. Ashley, Cibber took "what he could use from these old failures" to cook up "a palatable hash out of unpromising leftovers". "The Comical Lovers" (1707) was based on <a href="John%20Dryden">Dryden's</a> "<a href="Marriage%20%C3%A0%20la%20mode%20%28Restoration%20Drama%29">Marriage à la Mode</a>". "The Rival Fools" (1709) was based on <a href="John%20Fletcher%20%28playwright%29">Fletcher's</a> "<a href="Wit%20at%20Several%20Weapons">Wit at Several Weapons</a>". He rewrote <a href="Pierre%20Corneille">Corneille's</a> "<a href="Le%20Cid">Le Cid</a>" with a happy ending as "Ximena" in 1712. "The Provoked Husband" (1728) was an unfinished fragment by <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a> that Cibber reworked and completed to great commercial success.

"The Nonjuror" (1717) was adapted from <a href="Moli%C3%A8re">Molière</a>'s "<a href="Tartuffe">Tartuffe</a>", and features a Papist spy as a villain. Written just two years after the <a href="Jacobite%20rising%20of%201715">Jacobite rising of 1715</a>, it was an obvious propaganda piece directed against Roman Catholics. "The Refusal" (1721) was based on Molière's "<a href="Les%20Femmes%20Savantes">Les Femmes Savantes</a>". Cibber's last play, "Papal Tyranny in the Reign of King John" was "a miserable mutilation of Shakespeare's "<a href="The%20Life%20and%20Death%20of%20King%20John">King John</a>"". Heavily politicised, it caused such a storm of ridicule during its 1736 rehearsal that Cibber withdrew it. During the <a href="Jacobite%20Rising%20of%201745">Jacobite Rising of 1745</a>, when the nation was again in fear of a <a href="Popery">Popish</a> pretender, it was finally acted, and this time accepted for patriotic reasons.

Cibber's career as both actor and theatre manager is important in the history of the British stage because he was one of the first in a long and illustrious line of actor-managers that would include such luminaries as Garrick, <a href="Henry%20Irving">Henry Irving</a>, and <a href="Herbert%20Beerbohm%20Tree">Herbert Beerbohm Tree</a>. Rising from actor at Drury Lane to advisor to the manager Christopher Rich, Cibber worked himself by degrees into a position to take over the company, first taking many of its players—including <a href="Thomas%20Doggett">Thomas Doggett</a>, <a href="Robert%20Wilks">Robert Wilks</a>, and <a href="Anne%20Oldfield">Anne Oldfield</a>—to form a new company at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Theatre">Queen's Theatre</a> in the Haymarket. The three actors squeezed out the previous owners in a series of lengthy and complex manoeuvres, but after Rich's <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> were revoked, Cibber, Doggett and Wilks were able to buy the company outright and return to the Theatre Royal by 1711. After a few stormy years of power-struggle between the prudent Doggett and the extravagant Wilks, Doggett was replaced by the upcoming actor <a href="Barton%20Booth">Barton Booth</a> and Cibber became in practice sole manager of Drury Lane. He set a pattern for the line of more charismatic and successful actors that were to succeed him in this combination of roles. His near-contemporary Garrick, as well as the 19th-century actor-managers Irving and Tree, would later structure their careers, writing, and manager identity around their own striking stage personalities. Cibber's "forte" as actor-manager was, by contrast, the manager side. He was a clever, innovative, and unscrupulous businessman who retained all his life a love of appearing on the stage. His triumph was that he rose to a position where, in consequence of his sole power over production and casting at Drury Lane, London audiences had to put up with him as an actor. Cibber's one significant mistake as a theatre manager was to pass over <a href="John%20Gay">John Gay</a>'s "<a href="The%20Beggar%27s%20Opera">The Beggar's Opera</a>", which became an outstanding success for <a href="John%20Rich%20%28producer%29">John Rich</a>'s theatre at <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn%20Fields">Lincoln's Inn Fields</a>. When Cibber attempted to mimic Gay's success with his own ballad-opera—"Love in a Riddle" (1729)—it was shouted down by the audience and Cibber cancelled its run. He rescued its comic subplot as "Damon and Phillida".

Cibber had learned from the bad example of Christopher Rich to be a careful and approachable employer for his actors, and was not unpopular with them; however, he made enemies in the literary world because of the power he wielded over authors. Plays he considered non-commercial were rejected or ruthlessly reworked. Many were outraged by his sharp business methods, which may be exemplified by the characteristic way he abdicated as manager in the mid-1730s. In 1732, Booth sold his share to John Highmore, and Wilks' share fell into the hands of John Ellys after Wilks' death. Cibber leased his share in the company to his scapegrace son <a href="Theophilus%20Cibber">Theophilus</a> for 442 pounds, but when Theophilus fell out with the other managers, they approached Cibber senior and offered to buy out his share. Without consulting Theophilus, Cibber sold his share for more than 3,000 pounds to the other managers, who promptly gave Theophilus his notice. According to one story, Cibber encouraged his son to lead the <a href="Actor%20Rebellion%20of%201733">actors in a walkout</a> and set up for themselves in the <a href="Haymarket%20Theatre">Haymarket</a>, rendering worthless the commodity he had sold. On behalf of his son, Cibber applied for a <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> to perform at the Haymarket, but it was refused by the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a>, who was "disgusted at Cibber's conduct". The Drury Lane managers attempted to shut down the rival Haymarket players by conspiring in the arrest of the lead actor, <a href="John%20Harper%20%28actor%29">John Harper</a>, on a charge of vagrancy, but the charge did not hold, and the attempt pushed public opinion to Theophilus' side. The Drury Lane managers were defeated, and Theophilus regained control of the company on his own terms.

Cibber's appointment as Poet Laureate in December 1730 was widely assumed to be a political rather than artistic honour, and a reward for his untiring support of the <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whigs</a>, the party of Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a>. Most of the leading writers, such as <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>, were excluded from contention for the laureateship because they were <a href="Tory">Tories</a>. Cibber's verses had few admirers even in his own time, and Cibber acknowledged cheerfully that he did not think much of them. His 30 birthday odes for the royal family and other duty pieces incumbent on him as Poet Laureate came in for particular scorn, and these offerings would regularly be followed by a flurry of anonymous <a href="parody">parodies</a>, some of which Cibber claimed in his "Apology" to have written himself. In the 20th century, <a href="D.%20B.%20Wyndham-Lewis">D. B. Wyndham-Lewis</a> and <a href="Charles%20Lee%20%28author%29">Charles Lee</a> considered some of Cibber's laureate poems funny enough to be included in their classic "anthology of bad verse", "The Stuffed Owl" (1930). However, Cibber was at least as distinguished as his immediate four predecessors, three of whom were also playwrights rather than poets.

From the beginning of the 18th century, when Cibber first rose to be Rich's right-hand man at Drury Lane, his perceived opportunism and brash, thick-skinned personality gave rise to many barbs in print, especially against his patchwork plays. The early attacks were mostly anonymous, but <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a> and <a href="Tom%20Brown%20%28satirist%29">Tom Brown</a> are suggested as potential authors. Later, <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>, <a href="John%20Dennis%20%28dramatist%29">John Dennis</a> and <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a> all lambasted Cibber in print. The most famous conflict Cibber had was with <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>.

Pope's animosity began in 1717 when he helped <a href="John%20Arbuthnot">John Arbuthnot</a> and <a href="John%20Gay">John Gay</a> write a farce, "<a href="Three%20Hours%20After%20Marriage">Three Hours After Marriage</a>", in which one of the characters, "Plotwell" was modelled on Cibber. Notwithstanding, Cibber put the play on at Drury Lane with himself playing the part of Plotwell, but the play was not well received. During the staging of a different play, Cibber introduced jokes at the expense of "Three Hours After Marriage", while Pope was in the audience. Pope was infuriated, as was Gay who got into a physical fight with Cibber on a subsequent visit to the theatre. Pope published a pamphlet satirising Cibber, and continued his literary assault for the next 25 years.

In the first version of his landmark literary satire "<a href="Dunciad">Dunciad</a>" (1728), Pope referred contemptuously to Cibber's "past, vamp'd, future, old, reviv'd, new" plays, produced with "less human genius than God gives an ape". Cibber's elevation to laureateship in 1730 further inflamed Pope against him. Cibber was selected for political reasons, as he was a supporter of the Whig government of <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a>, while Pope was a Tory. The selection of Cibber for this honour was widely seen as especially cynical coming at a time when Pope, Gay, Thomson, <a href="Ambrose%20Philips">Ambrose Philips</a>, and <a href="Edward%20Young">Edward Young</a> were all in their prime. As one <a href="epigram">epigram</a> of the time put it:
Pope, mortified by the elevation of Cibber to laureateship and incredulous at what he held to be the vainglory of his "Apology" (1740), attacked Cibber extensively in his poetry.

Cibber replied mostly with good humour to Pope's aspersions ("some of which are in conspicuously bad taste", as Lowe points out), until 1742 when he responded in kind in "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so frequently fond of Mr. Cibber's name". In this pamphlet, Cibber's most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope's "Epistle to Arbuthnot" (1735) to Cibber's "whore", which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a <a href="brothel">brothel</a>. "I must own", wrote Cibber, "that I believe I know more of your whoring than you do of mine; because I don't recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of my Amours, though I have been very near an Eye-Witness of Yours." Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked due to a <a href="tuberculosis">tubercular</a> infection of the spine he contracted when young, Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous, and he speaks mockingly of the "little-tiny manhood" of Pope. For once the laughers were on Cibber's side, and the story "raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope's expense". Pope made no direct reply, but took one of the most famous revenges in literary history. In the revised "Dunciad" that appeared in 1743, he changed his hero, the King of Dunces, from <a href="Lewis%20Theobald">Lewis Theobald</a> to Colley Cibber.

The derogatory allusions to Cibber in consecutive versions of Pope's <a href="mock-heroic">mock-heroic</a> "Dunciad", from 1728 to 1743, became more elaborate as the conflict between the two men escalated, until, in the final version of the poem, Pope crowned Cibber King of Dunces. From being merely one symptom of the artistic decay of Britain, he was transformed into the demigod of stupidity, the true son of the goddess Dulness. Apart from the personal quarrel, Pope had reasons of literary appropriateness for letting Cibber take the place of his first choice of King, Lewis Theobald. Theobald, who had embarrassed Pope by contrasting Pope's impressionistic Shakespeare edition (1725) with Theobald's own scholarly edition (1726), also wrote Whig propaganda for hire, as well as dramatic productions which were to Pope abominations for their mixing of tragedy and comedy and for their "low" <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> and opera. However, Cibber was an even better King in these respects, more high-profile both as a political opportunist and as the powerful manager of Drury Lane, and with the crowning circumstance that his political allegiances and theatrical successes had gained him the laureateship. To Pope this made him an epitome of all that was wrong with British letters. Pope explains in the "Hyper-critics of Ricardus Aristarchus" prefatory to the 1743 "Dunciad" that Cibber is the perfect hero for a mock-heroic parody, since his "Apology" exhibits every trait necessary for the inversion of an <a href="Epic%20poetry">epic</a> hero. An epic hero must have wisdom, courage, and <a href="Platonic%20love">chivalric love</a>, says Pope, and the perfect hero for an anti-epic therefore should have vanity, impudence, and debauchery. As wisdom, courage, and love combine to create magnanimity in a hero, so vanity, impudence, and debauchery combine to make buffoonery for the satiric hero. His revisions, however, were considered too hasty by later critics who pointed out inconsistent passages that damaged his own poem for the sake of personal vindictiveness.

Writing about the degradation of taste brought on by <a href="special%20effects">theatrical effects</a>, Pope quotes Cibber's own "confessio" in the "Apology":

Pope's notes call Cibber a hypocrite, and in general the attacks on Cibber are conducted in the notes added to the "Dunciad", and not in the body of the poem. As hero of the "Dunciad", Cibber merely watches the events of Book II, dreams Book III, and sleeps through Book IV.

Once Pope struck, Cibber became an easy target for other satirists. He was attacked as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the "Apology", Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a> satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of "The Champion". The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.

The plays below were produced at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>, unless otherwise stated. The dates given are of first known performance.


"Bulls and Bears", a farce performed at Drury Lane on 2 December 1715, was attributed to Cibber but was never published. "The Dramatic Works of Colley Cibber, Esq." (London, 1777) includes a play called "Flora, or Hob in the Well", but it is not by Cibber. "Hob, or the Country Wake. A Farce. By Mr. Doggett" was attributed to Cibber by William Chetwood in his "General History of the Stage" (1749), but <a href="John%20Genest">John Genest</a> in "Some Account of the English Stage" (1832) thought it was by <a href="Thomas%20Doggett">Thomas Doggett</a>. Other plays attributed to Cibber but probably not by him include "Cinna's Conspiracy", performed at Drury Lane on 19 February 1713, and "The Temple of Dullness" of 1745.

Ferugliotherium

Ferugliotherium is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of fossil <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s in the family <a href="Ferugliotheriidae">Ferugliotheriidae</a> from the <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> and/or <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> period (<a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a>; around 70 million years ago) of Argentina. It contains a single species, Ferugliotherium windhauseni, which was first described in 1986. Although originally interpreted on the basis of a single <a href="brachydont">brachydont</a> (low-<a href="tooth%20crown">crowned</a>) <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> as a member of <a href="Multituberculata">Multituberculata</a>, an extinct group of small, rodent-like mammals, it was recognized as related to the <a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a> (high-crowned) <a href="Sudamericidae">Sudamericidae</a> following the discovery of additional material in the early 1990s. After a jaw of the sudamericid "<a href="Sudamerica">Sudamerica</a>" was described in 1999, these animals (collectively known as <a href="Gondwanatheria">Gondwanatheria</a>) were no longer considered to be multituberculates and a few fossils that were previously considered to be "Ferugliotherium" were assigned to unspecified multituberculates instead. Since 2005, a relationship between gondwanatheres and multituberculates has again received support. A closely related animal, "<a href="Trapalcotherium">Trapalcotherium</a>", was described in 2009 on the basis of a single tooth.

About twenty teeth and a jaw fragment have been referred to "Ferugliotherium", but the assignment of many of these is controversial or has been superseded. The upper and lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s are long and rodent-like and have <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> on only one side of the crown. A fragment of the lower jaw shows that the <a href="dental%20alveolus">tooth socket</a> of the lower incisor was very long, extending below the fourth <a href="premolar">premolar</a> (p4). The p4 is preserved in this fragment. It is blade-shaped and resembles multituberculate p4s. However, the determination of this fossil as "Ferugliotherium" is in question. The identity of a few additional isolated premolars assigned to "Ferugliotherium", some resembling multituberculates, is also uncertain. The first lower molariform (molar-like tooth; mf1) is known from four examples, of which two were originally identified as upper molars of a different species ("Vucetichia gracilis"), which is now considered a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of "Ferugliotherium". They bear two longitudinal rows of three or four <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusps</a> and transverse crests and furrows. A single example each of the second lower (mf2) and first upper molariform (MF1) show that these teeth also had longitudinal cusp rows and transverse furrows and crests, but the mf2 had only two or perhaps three cusps per row and the MF1 had three longitudinal rows.

Although "Ferugliotherium" teeth are much lower-crowned than those of the Sudamericidae, they share an essentially similar pattern on the <a href="Occlusion%20%28dentistry%29">occlusal</a> (chewing) surface of mf1 and mf2, similar incisors, backward jaw movement during chewing, and enamel with small <a href="enamel%20prism">prisms</a>. "Ferugliotherium" is thought to have been a small animal, with a body mass of about 70 g (2.5 oz), and may have eaten insects and plant material. Its remains have been found in two <a href="geological%20formation">geological formation</a>s of southern Argentina, where it is part of a mammal fauna that also includes the sudamericid "<a href="Gondwanatherium">Gondwanatherium</a>" and a variety of <a href="dryolestoid">dryolestoid</a>s.

"Ferugliotherium windhauseni" was named in 1986 by Argentinean paleontologist <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Bonaparte">José Bonaparte</a> on the basis of a single second lower <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> (m2) from the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Los%20Alamitos%20Formation">Los Alamitos Formation</a> of Argentina. Both the <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a>, "Ferugliotherium", and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "windhauseni", honor geologists who studied the geology of <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>: <a href="Egidio%20Feruglio">Egidio Feruglio</a> and <a href="Anselmo%20Windhausen">Anselmo Windhausen</a>, respectively. Bonaparte created a new <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, <a href="Ferugliotheriidae">Ferugliotheriidae</a>, for the new species and tentatively assigned it to <a href="Multituberculata">Multituberculata</a>, an extinct group of mammals that was diverse during the late Cretaceous, mostly in the northern continents (<a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a>). In subsequent years, other finds permitted a more confident assignment to Multituberculata. In 1990, Bonaparte described "Vucetichia gracilis" on the basis of what he interpreted as two upper molars of a relative of "<a href="Gondwanatherium">Gondwanatherium</a>" within the order <a href="Gondwanatheria">Gondwanatheria</a>, a small mammalian group that was at the time known only from Argentinean fossils and thought to be related to <a href="xenarthra">xenarthra</a>ns as part of a now-discarded group called <a href="Paratheria%20%28mammals%29">Paratheria</a>. The generic name, "Vucetichia", commemorates Argentinean paleontologist Guiomar Vucetich, and the specific name, "gracilis" (Latin for "slender"), refers to the animal's small size.

However, in 1990 <a href="David%20W.%20Krause">David W. Krause</a> and Bonaparte argued that Gondwanatheria, including "Ferugliotherium" (family Ferugliotheriidae), "Gondwanatherium", and "<a href="Sudamerica">Sudamerica</a>" (family <a href="Sudamericidae">Sudamericidae</a>), should be placed within Multituberculata. Two years later, Krause, Bonaparte, and <a href="Zofia%20Kielan-Jaworowska">Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska</a> described additional material of "Ferugliotherium" (which they tentatively placed in the multituberculate suborder <a href="Plagiaulacoidea">Plagiaulacoidea</a>) and suggested that the supposed upper molars of "Vucetichia" were in fact heavily <a href="tooth%20wear">worn</a> first lower molariforms (mf1) of "Ferugliotherium". In 1993, Krause described an unworn mf1 of "Ferugliotherium" and confirmed that "Vucetichia" was based on worn specimens of "Ferugliotherium" and therefore a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of the latter. In the same year, he and Bonaparte argued once again that "Ferugliotherium", "Gondwanatherium", and "Sudamerica" formed a closely related group of multituberculates, which they called the superfamily Gondwanatherioidea. Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte described a lower jaw fragment with a multituberculate-like lower fourth <a href="premolar">premolar</a> (p4) from Los Alamitos in 1996 and tentatively identified it as "Ferugliotherium". On the basis of the <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphological</a> features of the jaw fragment, they argued that gondwanatherians were not closely related to any other multituberculate group, and consequently placed them in a suborder of their own, Gondwanatheria.

In 1999, Rosendo Pascual and colleagues described a jaw of "Sudamerica". Because some of this jaw's features were thought to be incompatible with a multituberculate identity, they regarded gondwanatheres (including "Ferugliotherium") as Mammalia "<a href="incertae%20sedis">incertae sedis</a>". However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including "Ferugliotherium") and multituberculates. The controversy is partially due to disagreement over the assignment of two upper premolars and the jaw fragment described by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996; Gurovich and Beck identify these as "Ferugliotherium", while Kielan-Jaworowska and others regard them as indeterminate multituberculates.

In the 2000s, some possible close relatives of "Ferugliotherium" were discovered. An enigmatic tooth from the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> of Peru, <a href="LACM%20149371">LACM 149371</a>, was described in 2004 as possibly related to the family Ferugliotheriidae. Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues described a p4 from the <a href="La%20Colonia%20Formation">La Colonia Formation</a> (Late Cretaceous of Argentina) as a new multituberculate genus, "<a href="Argentodites">Argentodites</a>", in 2007, but Gurovich and Beck noted close similarities between this p4 and the p4 in the possible jaw fragment of "Ferugliotherium" and suggested that it represented "Ferugliotherium" or a closely related species. A single mf1 from the <a href="Allen%20Formation">Allen Formation</a> (Late Cretaceous of Argentina) was described as another ferugliotheriid genus, "<a href="Trapalcotherium">Trapalcotherium</a>", in 2009.

"Ferugliotherium" is known from isolated teeth, the assignment of some of which is controversial. The material from the Los Alamitos Formation, which is mostly in the <a href="Museo%20Argentino%20de%20Ciencias%20Naturales%20Bernardino%20Rivadavia">Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia</a> (MACN) in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, with one tooth in the <a href="Museo%20de%20La%20Plata">Museo de La Plata</a> (MLP) in <a href="La%20Plata%2C%20Argentina">La Plata, Argentina</a>, has been thoroughly described; while there are additional "Ferugliotherium" fossils from the La Colonia Formation, they have not been described in detail. Although the fragmentary nature of the known fossils of "Ferugliotherium" makes it impossible to determine its <a href="dental%20formula">dental formula</a> with certainty, Gurovich suggested that it had one <a href="incisor">incisor</a> (possibly two in the upper jaw), no <a href="canine%20%28tooth%29">canines</a>, one or two premolars, and two molars on each side of the lower and upper jaws. However, on the basis of comparisons with "Sudamerica", which is known to have had four lower molariforms (molar-like teeth, either premolars or molars) in its lower jaw, Pascual and Ortiz-Jaureguizar suggested in 2007 that "Ferugliotherium" may also have had four lower molars.

"Ferugliotherium" was much smaller than the sudamericids "Gondwanatherium" and "Sudamerica", and its body mass is estimated to have been about 70 g (2.5 oz). Unlike the <a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a> (high-crowned) sudamericids, "Ferugliotherium" has <a href="brachydont">brachydont</a> (low-crowned) molariform teeth that are supported by at least two roots, not a single massive root. The direction of wear on the teeth indicates that "Ferugliotherium", "Gondwanatherium", and "Sudamerica" all had <a href="palinal">palinal</a> jaw movement (i.e., the lower jaw moved backwards during the power stroke of chewing)—a feature otherwise only seen in multituberculates among mammals.

Three fragmentary "Ferugliotherium" lower incisors (MACN Pv-RN 701A, 701B, and 701C) are known from the Los Alamitos Formation. Another incisor, MACN Pv-RN 970, was assigned to "Ferugliotherium" by Bonaparte in 1990, but it is much larger than the other three incisors, which are otherwise similar, and probably represents "Gondwanatherium" instead. Only the tips of the three incisors are preserved. They are laterally compressed, with an estimated width of 1.3 mm and height of 2.4 mm in 701A. The medial side (towards the middle of the mouth) is flat, but the lateral side (towards the sides) is convex. There is <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> only on the lower (ventral) side. A large <a href="wear%20facet">wear facet</a> is present at the tip, forming an angle of about 35° with the ventral margin in 701A. The three incisor fragments are identified as "Ferugliotherium" because of their size and provenance and the presence of a restricted enamel band. They show features, such as lateral compression, an acute angle at the tip, small curvature, and an irregular cross section, that are usually seen in lower, not upper incisors in mammals with <a href="wikt%3Aprocumbent">procumbent</a> incisors, such as rodents and <a href="taeniolabidoid">taeniolabidoid</a> multituberculates.

Four specimens (MACN Pv-RN 702A through 702D) are thought to represent second upper incisors (I2) of "Ferugliotherium". 702A (height 1.5 mm; width 1.1 mm) and 702B are slightly larger than 702C (height 1.2 mm; width 0.9 mm) and 702D. The smaller incisors cannot be lateral incisors (I3), because 702C's wear facet is stronger than would be expected in an I3; therefore, all four upper incisors are identified as central incisors (I2). To explain the size difference, Krause and colleagues suggested that "Ferugliotherium" was variable in size or that the smaller incisors were <a href="deciduous%20dentition">deciduous</a> precursors of the larger permanent tooth. They considered it less likely that multiple species with similar incisors were present. The upper incisors have enamel only on the dorsal side. The wear facet at the tip is preserved only in 702C, forming an angle of 52° with the dorsal side, and is more concave than the facet in the lower incisors. 702A–D are recognizable as upper incisors because they have a less acute angle at the tip and are less laterally compressed, more curved, and elliptical in cross section.

Incisors of "Ferugliotherium" and "Gondwanatherium" are similar in overall shape and share a restricted band of enamel—a feature otherwise seen only in multituberculates among Mesozoic mammals. The incisors of "Sudamerica" are also similar.

MACN Pv-RN 975, a fragment of the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) preserving one premolar, was discovered in 1991 and tentatively identified as "Ferugliotherium" by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, but this assignment remains controversial. The poorly preserved and worn premolar is a bladelike tooth, resembling multituberculate fourth lower premolars (p4). The premolar is 4.8 mm long and bears eight faint ridges on both the labial (towards the lips) and lingual (towards the tongue) sides. On the labial side, the four ridges at the back are more widely separated than the four in front of them. The back and front margins of the tooth are parallel and there is no small cusp on the labial side. There are two roots; the one at the front is larger than the one at the back and bears a furrow. The lower border of the enamel cover is marked by two semicircular extensions of the enamel on the front side, but there is only one such extension at the back. By its size, the number of ridges, and apparently greater length than height, it differs from all known multituberculate first, second, and third lower premolars, indicating that it is a p4.

The dentary (lower jaw bone) itself is robust and short. The length axis of the p4 makes an angle of about 58° with the length axis of the jawbone. The bone is concave on the lingual, but convex on the labial side. There is a <a href="diastema%20%28dentistry%29">diastema</a> (gap) between the p4 and the incisor that would have been in front of it, as in the jaw of "Sudamerica". Gurovich estimated the length of the diastema as 2.5 mm. There is a rounded <a href="mental%20foramen">mental foramen</a> (an opening in the labial side of the jawbone), with a diameter of 0.7 mm, located about 0.8 mm below the dorsal margin of the bone and 1.5 mm in front of the p4. Although the incisor itself is not preserved, its <a href="tooth%20alveolus">alveolus</a> (the housing of the root) is in part. As in "Sudamerica", it extends far into the dentary, passing below p4. The alveolus is 1.5 mm wide below the front root of p4 and 1.4 mm at the back of the jaw fragment. Although the height of the alveolus cannot be determined because the lower side is broken away, the incisor must have been quite deep.

When it was discovered that "Sudamerica" had four molariform teeth and no bladelike premolar in its lower jaw, Pascual, Kielan-Jaworowska, and colleagues removed MACN Pv-RN 975 from "Ferugliotherium", which they expected to have the same dental formula as its fellow gondwanathere "Sudamerica", and identified it as an indeterminate multituberculate instead. Pascual and colleagues argued that molariform teeth as seen in "Sudamerica" could not have evolved from the bladelike p4 of "Ferugliotherium", and that it was unlikely that additional molars had been added in "Sudamerica". In 2004 and 2007, Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues aligned the dentary with the multituberculate suborder "<a href="Plagiaulacida">Plagiaulacida</a>" because the p4 is rectangular in labial view, not curved as in the suborder <a href="Cimolodonta">Cimolodonta</a>. This feature was also used to distinguish MACN Pv-RN 975 from the single p4 assigned to "Argentodites", which was tentatively placed in Cimolodonta.

Gurovich, Guillermo Rougier, and colleagues, on the other hand, maintain that the dentary is referable to "Ferugliotherium" and that the p4s of "Argentodites" and MACN Pv-RN 975 are very similar. The alveolus of MACN Pv-RN 975 fits the lower incisors attributed to "Ferugliotherium" in size and the blade-like premolar is of the size expected for an animal with molariforms the size of "Ferugliotherium" teeth. If the dentary and premolars (whose identification has been similarly controversial; see below) do not belong to "Ferugliotherium", then, Gurovich and Beck argue, the Los Alamitos Formation would contain two mammals ("Ferugliotherium" and a multituberculate) similar in size and morphology, and therefore presumably occupying similar <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s—and one of those would be represented only by molariforms and incisors and the other only by premolars and a jaw fragment among the available fossils. Furthermore, they noted that the transition from blade-like to molariform premolars had actually been observed in the fossil record of the extinct <a href="sthenurine">sthenurine</a> kangaroos, and that the first molariform in "Sudamerica" and "Gondwanatherium" is laterally compressed, suggesting that it may have derived from a blade-like tooth. Gurovich and Beck attributed the difference in shape between the MACN Pv-RN 975 and "Argentodites" p4s to the extensive wear of the former, and suggested that the two are similar enough that they probably represent at least closely related species.

Krause and colleagues identified a single tooth, MACN Pv-RN 251, as a possible deciduous anterior (i.e., not p4 or dp4, the deciduous version of p4) lower premolar of "Ferugliotherium". It is minuscule, with a length of 0.85 mm and width of 0.5 mm (assuming the tooth is oriented correctly). It bears two serrations (small projections) at the tip of the crown—one around the middle of the crown and the other at what may be the back of the crown, where it is highest. Two prominent ridges descend from each serration towards the front down the sides of the tooth. No roots are preserved, but the rounded surface of the lower side of the tooth suggests they may have been resorbed, which would indicate that the tooth is deciduous. Krause and colleagues suggested that the tooth may have been the frontmost premolar, whether deciduous or permanent. However, Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte wrote that this tooth does not match the partial jaw MACN Pv-RN 975, which has no alveoli in front of p4, and Pascual and colleagues agreed in 1999 that the tooth probably does not belong to "Ferugliotherium".

Bonaparte had identified another tooth, MACN Pv-RN 252, as a possible "Ferugliotherium" lower premolar in 1990, but this fossil is very fragmentary and according to Krause and colleagues, it cannot even be proven to be a mammalian tooth.

Krause and colleagues identified two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as anterior upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. One row (row A; possibly the lingual one) includes four cusps, the other (row B) includes at least two, but is damaged. In row A, there are three ridges (at the front, middle, and back) extending from the tip of the base of each cusp. The second and third cusps are largest and most widely separated from each other. In row B, one cusp bears three ridges, of which one extends towards the other cusp in the row and the two others towards row A) and the other cusp is damaged. 250 is more fragmentary, but bears at least five cusps and may represent the same tooth position as 249, though it would come from the opposite side of the mouth. The microstructure of the enamel of this tooth has been studied. With a width of about 55 μm near the tip of a cusp, the enamel is thin. The <a href="enamel%20prism">enamel prism</a>s are straight, small, and rounded and there is little material between the prisms. Small, rounded prisms are also seen in "Gondwanatherium", "Sudamerica", and other gondwanatheres, but in few multituberculates. Even in those multituberculates that do have small prisms, the prism sheath is closed, but the sheath is incomplete in "Gondwanatherium" and possibly "Ferugliotherium".

Krause and colleagues wrote that these two teeth resemble multituberculate deciduous anterior upper premolars, particularly second and third premolars (P2 and P3), and used this as one of their arguments for identifying "Ferugliotherium" as a multituberculate. However, as with the dentary MACN Pv-RN 975, the two upper premolars were excluded from "Ferugliotherium" and identified as multituberculates by Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues after the discovery of the jaw of "Sudamerica". Gurovich continues to identify them as "Ferugliotherium" on the basis of their size and provenance and other similarities between "Ferugliotherium" and multituberculates.

Five putative lower molariforms of "Ferugliotherium" are known from the Los Alamitos Formation (MACN Pv-RN 20, 174, 175, and 253 and MLP 88-III-28-1). These teeth include the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>s of "Ferugliotherium windhauseni" (MACN Pv-RN 20, the only second lower molariform, or m2) and "Vucetichia gracilis" (MACN Pv-RN 174).

The best-preserved mf1 is MLP 88-III-28-1. The crown is unworn and complete and there are no roots, suggesting that the tooth had not yet erupted when its owner died. Krause, who first described the tooth in 1993, identified it as a right molar, but the subsequent discovery of the jaw of "Sudamerica" made it clear that "Ferugliotherium" molariforms had been reversed, and MLP 88-III-28-1 is actually from the left side of the jaw. The tooth is 2.2 mm long and 1.5 mm wide. The crown is roughly rectangular, with rounded corners, and bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. The lingual row consists of four cusps, which are smaller and lower than the three labial ones. The cusps in this row become smaller and lower from the front to the back. Two ridges descend from the tip of each cusp to the lingual and labial sides. The labial ridges on the first and fourth cusp only reach the base of the cusp, but those on the second and third cusps join ridges descending from the first and second labial cusp. In the first three cusps, the lingual ridge extends to near the lingual margin of the tooth and then turns backward; the end of the ridge is lingual to the next cusp. In the fourth cusp, the ridge hardly extends posteriorly, but rather labially, forming the posterior margin of the tooth and joining a ridge descending from the last labial cusp. The labial cusp row includes three, larger cusps, each of which bears two ridges that descend lingually into the valley between the two cusp rows. The front ridge of each pair ends in the central valley, and the back ridge joins a ridge from a lingual cusp. The ridge pattern results in the presence of three transverse furrows between the main cusps.

Another mf1, MACN Pv-RN 253, is almost unworn, but damaged: only the front two lingual cusps and the first two cusps and part of the third in the labial row are preserved. This tooth is similar to MLP 88-III-28-1 in all respects. However, Gurovich suggests that it may also be an m2. MACN Pv-RN 174, which is heavily worn, and MACN Pv-RN 175, which is not only heavily worn but has also undergone severe abrasion, were originally identified as upper molars of "Vucetichia gracilis" by Bonaparte in 1990. The roots of MACN Pv-RN 174 are preserved; at the front and back of the tooth, there is a pair of roots, which are fused near their bases. It has small enamel prisms. Krause and colleagues suggested in 1992 that 174 and 175 were mf1s of "Ferugliotherium" on the basis of similarities with 253, and Krause confirmed this in 1993 by describing the complete mf1 MLP 88-III-28-1. The related ferugliotheriid genus "Trapalcotherium" is known from a single mf1, which is similar to "Ferugliotherium" mf1s but different in some morphological details (see <a href="Trapalcotherium%23Relationships">"Trapalcotherium": Relationships</a>).

The holotype, MACN Pv-RN 20, is a right mf2 according to both Krause and colleagues (1992) and Gurovich (2005), but Gurovich considered the side that Krause and colleagues thought was lingual to be labial, and vice versa. The latter interpretation is used in the following description. It is almost square, but at the front it is slightly narrower than at the back. The labial side of the tooth is taller and less worn than the lingual side. There are two rows of cusps, and each lingual cusp is connected to each labial cusp by a broad crest, with one or more fossas in the middle. One of the two labial cusps may have been divided into two smaller cusps. The two crests are separated by a deep furrow. The enamel prisms of this tooth are small, like those of the premolar MACN Pv-RN 250.

Transverse ridges between the cusps, as seen in "Ferugliotherium", are known in only one multituberculate, "<a href="Essonodon">Essonodon</a>", but the ridge pattern in "Essonodon" is more complicated and the animal lacks the prominent furrows of "Ferugliotherium" and differs in numerous other features. On the other hand, overall patterns of cusps and ridges are essentially similar among "Ferugliotherium", "Gondwanatherium", and "Sudamerica", indicating that the three are closely related.

A single tooth, MACN Pv-RN 248, is currently identified as a "Ferugliotherium" upper molariform. In 1992, Krause and colleagues labeled it as a right MF1, but Gurovich identifies it as a left MF1 or possibly even a right mf1. <a href="LACM%20149371">LACM 149371</a>, an enigmatic tooth from the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> of <a href="Santa%20Rosa%20local%20fauna">Santa Rosa</a>, Peru, may represent an upper molar of an animal related to "Ferugliotherium". Like the latter, it has cusps that are compressed from front to back and that are connected to the center of the crown by low crests.

MACN Pv-RN 248 is somewhat damaged and almost rectangular, but slightly narrower at the back than at the front. The tooth bears three longitudinal rows of cusps. The middle row consists of five cusps, the labial row (assuming it is a left M1; if it is from the right, "lingual" and "labial" should be reversed) includes two or perhaps three cusps, and the lingual row includes probably four cusps. The lingual and middle rows extend across the entire length of the tooth, but the labial row is shorter, extending across about 70% of the length. The middle row is oriented obliquely with respect to the length axis of the tooth, so that it converges with the lingual row towards the back of the tooth. The front lingual corner of the tooth is missing, but it appears that the first cusps in the lingual and middle rows are connected by two ridges, one at the front margin of the tooth and one at the back of the cusps. A deep fossa (basin) lies between the two cusps and their connecting ridges. Behind these two cusps, a transverse furrow extends across the width of the tooth. The second lingual and middle cusps are also connected by a crest, which is somewhat weaker than those connecting the first cusps. Another transverse furrow extends behind the second cusps and also separates the second middle cusp from the labial row. A third furrow, behind the third lingual and middle cusps, also separates the first from the second labial cusp. Three ridges descend from the fourth lingual cusp: one connects to the fourth middle cusp, one ends blindly between the fourth lingual and middle cusps, and one connects to the fifth middle cusp. The second labial cusp, which is larger than the first one, is superficially divided into two smaller cusps by an indentation on its lingual side. There are vertical grooves at the bases of the cusps.

Remains of "Ferugliotherium" come from two <a href="geological%20formation">formations</a> in the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> of southern Argentina, the <a href="Los%20Alamitos%20Formation">Los Alamitos</a> and <a href="La%20Colonia%20Formation">La Colonia Formation</a>s. These and the <a href="Allen%20Formation">Allen Formation</a> (which has yielded "Trapalcotherium") are all dated to the <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> (84–71 million years ago) and/or <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> (71–66 million years ago), the penultimate and ultimate stages of the Cretaceous. The La Colonia Formation may be somewhat younger than the other two, while the Los Alamitos Formation has been considered Campanian, and can be dated to the Campanian or Maastrichtian on the basis of <a href="palynology">palynology</a>. The Allen Formation is likely Maastrichtian, but not latest Maastrichtian.

The Los Alamitos Formation is located in southeastern <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Negro%20Province">Río Negro Province</a>, in the vicinity of the town of <a href="Cona%20Niyeu">Cona Niyeu</a> and was probably deposited in a marshy environment. In 1983, it yielded the first Mesozoic mammal to be found in Argentina, "<a href="Mesungulatum%20houssayi">Mesungulatum houssayi</a>", and since then, the mammalian fauna has expanded to 14 species. Most of those belong to the archaic mammalian group <a href="Dryolestoidea">Dryolestoidea</a>, but the fauna also includes the gondwanatheres "Ferugliotherium" and "Gondwanatherium". The dryolestoids "Mesungulatum houssayi" and "<a href="Groebertherium%20novasi">Groebertherium novasi</a>" and the two gondwanatheres are the most common mammals. Other fossils found in the Los Alamitos Formation include fish, frogs, turtles, <a href="Madtsoiidae">madtsoiid</a> snakes, dinosaurs such as "<a href="Secernosaurus">Secernosaurus</a>", <a href="gastropod">gastropod</a>s, and other invertebrates.

The La Colonia Formation outcrops in north-central <a href="Chubut%20Province">Chubut Province</a>, and the mammalian fossils come from the <a href="Mirasol%20Chico">Mirasol Chico</a> valley. The formation includes fluvial (river), deep-sea, and near-shore deposits, and the mammalian fauna probably comes from an estuary, tidal flat, or coastal plain. The La Colonia Formation also contains dryolestoids, such as "<a href="Coloniatherium">Coloniatherium</a>" and "<a href="Reigitherium">Reigitherium</a>", as well as a ferugliotheriid and the putative multituberculate "Argentodites". In addition, the La Colonia Formation has yielded fossils of a wide array of other animals, including crocodiles, <a href="plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a>s, lungfish ("<a href="Ceratodus">Ceratodus</a>"), and dinosaurs (including "<a href="Carnotaurus">Carnotaurus</a>").

The high-crowned sudamericids were probably herbivores, but the lower-crowned "Ferugliotherium" was more probably an insectivore or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as "<a href="Mesodma">Mesodma</a>", which is thought to have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. It may have used its incisors for gnawing or slicing, and the blade-like p4 may also have been used for slicing hard plant parts, such as seeds. The wear patterns on "Ferugliotherium" teeth independently suggest that the animal may have eaten some plant material.

The Relapse

The Relapse, or, Virtue in Danger is a <a href="Restoration%20comedy">Restoration comedy</a> from 1696 written by <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>. The play is a sequel to <a href="Colley%20Cibber">Colley Cibber</a>'s "<a href="Love%27s%20Last%20Shift">Love's Last Shift, or, The Fool in Fashion</a>".

In Cibber's "Love's Last Shift", a free-living <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a> <a href="Rake%20%28character%29">rake</a> is brought to repentance and reform by the ruses of his wife, while in "The Relapse", the rake succumbs again to temptation and has a new love affair. His virtuous wife is also subjected to a determined seduction attempt, and resists with difficulty.

Vanbrugh planned "The Relapse" around particular actors at <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a>, writing their stage habits, public reputations, and personal relationships into the text. One such actor was Colley Cibber himself, who played the luxuriant <a href="fop">fop</a> Lord Foppington in both "Love's Last Shift" and "The Relapse". However, Vanbrugh's artistic plans were threatened by a cutthroat struggle between London's two theatre companies, each of which was "seducing" actors from the other. "The Relapse" came close to being not produced at all, but the successful performance that was eventually achieved in November 1696 vindicated Vanbrugh's intentions, and saved the company from bankruptcy as well.

Unlike "Love's Last Shift", which never again performed after the 1690s, "The Relapse" has retained its <a href="audience">audience</a> appeal. In the 18th century, however, its tolerant attitude towards actual and attempted <a href="adultery">adultery</a> gradually became unacceptable to public opinion, and the original play was for a century replaced on the stage by <a href="Richard%20Brinsley%20Sheridan">Sheridan</a>'s moralised version "<a href="A%20Trip%20to%20Scarborough">A Trip to Scarborough</a>" (1777). On the modern stage, "The Relapse" has been established as one of the most popular Restoration comedies, valued for Vanbrugh's light, throwaway wit and the consummate acting part of Lord Foppington, a <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a> character with a dark side.

"Love's Last Shift" can be seen as an early sign of Cibber's sensitivity to shifts of public opinion, which was to be useful to him in his later career as manager at Drury Lane (see <a href="Colley%20Cibber">Colley Cibber</a>). In the 1690s, the economic and political power balance of the nation tilted from the <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a> towards the middle class after the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688, and middle-class values of religion, morality, and <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a>s became more dominant, not least in attitudes to the stage. "Love's Last Shift" is one of the first illustrations of a massive shift in audience taste, away from the analytic bent and sexual frankness of <a href="Restoration%20comedy">Restoration comedy</a> and towards the conservative certainties and <a href="gender">gender</a> role <a href="backlash%20%28sociology%29">backlash</a> of exemplary or sentimental comedy. The play illustrates Cibber's opportunism at a moment in time before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something into his first play to please every section of the audience, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness. The way Vanbrugh, in his turn, allows the reformed rake to relapse quite cheerfully, and has the only preaching in the play come from the comically corrupt parson of "Fatgoose Living", has made some early 20th-century critics refer to "The Relapse" as the last of the true Restoration comedies. However, Vanbrugh's play is also affected by the taste of the 1690s, and compared to a play like the courtier <a href="William%20Wycherley">William Wycherley</a>'s "<a href="The%20Country%20Wife">The Country Wife</a>" of 20 years earlier, with its celebration of predatory aristocratic masculinity, "The Relapse" contains quite a few moments of morality and uplift. In fact it has a kind of parallel structure to "Love's Last Shift": in the climactic scene of Cibber's play, Amanda's virtue reforms her husband, and in the corresponding scene of "The Relapse", it reforms her admirer Worthy. Such moments have not done the play any favours with modern critics.

"Love's Last Shift" is the story of a last "shift" or trick that a virtuous wife, Amanda, is driven to reform and retain her <a href="rake%20%28character%29">rakish</a> husband Loveless. Loveless has been away for ten years, dividing his time between the brothel and the bottle, and no longer recognises his wife when he returns to London. Acting the part of a high-class prostitute, Amanda lures Loveless into her luxurious house and treats him to the night of his dreams, confessing her true identity in the morning. Loveless is so impressed that he immediately reforms. A minor part that was a great hit with the première audience is the <a href="fop">fop</a> Sir Novelty Fashion, written by Cibber for himself to play. Sir Novelty flirts with all the women, but is more interested in his own exquisite appearance and witticisms, and Cibber would modestly write in his autobiography 45 years later, "was thought a good portrait of the foppery then in fashion". Combining daring sex scenes with sentimental reconciliations and Sir Novelty's buffoonery, "Love's Last Shift" offered something for everybody, and was a great box-office hit.

Vanbrugh's "The Relapse" is less sentimental and more analytical than "Love's Last Shift", subjecting both the reformed husband and the virtuous wife to fresh temptations, and having them react with more psychological realism. Loveless falls for the vivacious young widow Berinthia, while Amanda barely succeeds in summoning her virtue to reject her admirer Worthy. The three central characters, Amanda, Loveless, and Sir Novelty (ennobled by Vanbrugh into "Lord Foppington"), are the only ones that recur in both plays, the remainder of the "Relapse" characters being new.

In the <a href="trickster">trickster</a> <a href="subplot">subplot</a>, young Tom tricks his elder brother Lord Foppington out of his intended bride and her large <a href="dowry">dowry</a>. This plot takes up nearly half the play and expands the part of Sir Novelty to give more scope for the roaring success of Cibber's fop acting. Recycling Cibber's merely fashion-conscious fop, Vanbrugh lets him buy himself a title and equips him with enough aplomb and selfishness to weather all humiliations. Although Lord Foppington may be "very industrious to pass for an ass", as Amanda remarks, he is at bottom "a man who Nature has made no fool" (II.i.148). Literary historians agree in esteeming him "the greatest of all Restoration fops" (Dobrée), "brutal, evil, and smart" (Hume).

In the early 1690s, London had only one officially countenanced theatre company, the "United Company", badly managed and with its takings bled off by predatory investors ("adventurers"). To counter the draining of the company's income, the manager <a href="Christopher%20Rich%20%28theatre%20manager%29">Christopher Rich</a> slashed the salaries and traditional perks of his skilled professional actors, antagonising such popular performers as <a href="Thomas%20Betterton">Thomas Betterton</a>, the tragedienne <a href="Elizabeth%20Barry">Elizabeth Barry</a>, and the comedian <a href="Anne%20Bracegirdle">Anne Bracegirdle</a>. <a href="Colley%20Cibber">Colley Cibber</a> wrote in his autobiography that the owners of the United Company, "who had made a monopoly of the stage, and consequently presumed they might impose what conditions they pleased upon their people, did not consider that they were all this while endeavouring to enslave a set of actors whom the public… were inclined to support." Betterton and his colleagues set forth the bad finances of the United Company and the plight of the actors in a "Petition of the Players" submitted to the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a>. This unusual document is signed by nine men and six women, all established professional actors, and details a disreputable jumble of secret investments and "farmed" <a href="shares">shares</a>, making the case that owner chicanery rather than any failure of audience interest was at the root of the company's financial problems. Barely veiled strike threats in the actors' petition were met with an answering <a href="lockout%20%28industry%29">lock-out</a> threat from Rich in a "Reply of the Patentees", but the burgeoning conflict was pre-empted by a suspension of all play-acting from December until March 1695 on account of <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Queen Mary</a>'s illness and death. During this interval, a <a href="cooperative">cooperative</a> actors' company took shape under the leadership of Betterton and was granted a Royal "licence to act" on 25 March, to the dismay of Rich, who saw the threat too late.

The two companies that emerged from this labour/management conflict are usually known respectively as the "Patent Company" (the no-longer-united United Company) and "Betterton's Company", although Judith Milhous argues that the latter misrepresents the cooperative nature of the actors' company. In the following period of intense rivalry, the Patent Company was handicapped by a shortage of competent actors. "Seducing" actors (as the legal term was) back and forth between the companies was a key tactic in the ensuing struggle for position, and so were appeals to the Lord Chamberlain to issue <a href="injunction">injunction</a>s against seductions from the other side, which that functionary was quite willing to do. Later Rich also resorted to hiring amateurs, and to tempting Irish actors over from <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. But such measures were not yet in place for the staging of "The Relapse" in 1696, Rich's most desperate venture.

Vanbrugh is assumed to have attempted to tailor his play to the talents of particular actors and to what audiences would expect from them, as was normal practice (Holland), but this was exceptionally difficult to accomplish in 1695–96. "Love's Last Shift" had been cast from the remnants of the Patent Company—"learners" and "boys and girls"—after the walkout of the stars. Following the surprising success of this young cast, Vanbrugh and Rich had even greater difficulty in retaining the actors needed for "The Relapse". However, in spite of the continuous emergency in which the "Relapse" production was mounted, most of Vanbrugh's original intentions were eventually carried out.

To cast "Love's Last Shift" in January 1696, the Patent Company had to make the best use of such actors as remained after the 1694 split ("see cast list right"). An anonymous contemporary pamphlet describes the "despicable condition" the troupe had been reduced to:
The disproportion was so great at parting, that it was almost impossible, in Drury Lane, to muster up a sufficient number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience. No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; they who were left being for the most part learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.
The only well-regarded performers available were the Verbruggens, <a href="John%20Verbruggen">John</a> and <a href="Susanna%20Verbruggen">Susanna</a>, who had been re-seduced by Rich from Betterton's company. They were of course used in "Love's Last Shift", with John playing Loveless, the male lead, and his wife Susanna the flirtatious heiress Narcissa, a secondary character. The rest of the cast consisted of the new and untried (for instance <a href="Hildebrand%20Horden">Hildebrand Horden</a>, who had just joined Rich's troupe, playing a rakish young lover), the modest and lacklustre (Jane Rogers, playing Amanda, and <a href="Mary%20Kent">Mary Kent</a>, playing Sir Novelty's <a href="Mistress%20%28lover%29">mistress</a> Flareit), and the widely disliked (the opportunist Colley Cibber, playing Sir Novelty Fashion); people who had probably never been given the option of joining Betterton. Betterton's only rival as male lead, <a href="George%20Powell%20%28playwright%29">George Powell</a>, had most likely been left behind by the rebels with some relief (Milhous); while Powell was skilled and experienced, he was also notorious for his bad temper and alcoholism. Throughout the "seduction" tug-of-war between Rich and Betterton in 1695–96, Powell remained at Drury Lane, where he was in fact not used for "Love's Last Shift", but would instead spectacularly demonstrate his drinking problem at the première of "The Relapse".

Vanbrugh planned "The Relapse", too, round these limited casting resources and minor talents, which Peter Holland has argued explains the robust, farcical character of the play; Vanbrugh's second comedy, "<a href="The%20Provoked%20Wife">The Provoked Wife</a>" (1697), written for the better actors of the cooperative company, is a much subtler piece. "The Relapse" was written in six weeks and offered to the Patent Company in March, but because of the problems with contracting and retaining actors, it did not première until November. It is known from Cibber's autobiography that Vanbrugh had a decisive say in the ongoing casting changes made during these seven months; it is not known whether he altered his text to accommodate them.

To reinforce the connection with "Love's Last Shift" and capitalise on its unexpected success, Vanbrugh designed the central roles of Loveless, Amanda, and Sir Novelty for the same actors: John Verbruggen, Jane Rogers, and Colley Cibber. Keeping Rogers as Amanda was not a problem, since she was not an actress that the companies fought over, but holding on to John Verbruggen and Colley Cibber posed challenges, to which Rich rose with energetic campaigns of bribery and re-seduction. Filling the rest of the large "Relapse" cast presented a varied palette of problems, which forced some unconventional emergency casting.

<a href="John%20Verbruggen">John Verbruggen</a> was one of the original rebels and had been offered a share in the actors' company, but became disgruntled when his wife <a href="Susanna%20Verbruggen">Susanna</a>, a popular comedian, was not. For Rich, it was a stroke of luck to get Susanna and John back into his depleted and unskilled troupe. John's availability to play Loveless remained precarious, however. In September, when "The Relapse" had still not been staged after six months of trying (probably because Rich was still parleying with Cibber about "his" availability as Lord Foppington), John was still complaining about his employment situation, even getting into a physical fight over it at the theatre. This misbehaviour caused the Lord Chamberlain to declare his contract void and at the same time order him to stay with the Patent Company until January 1697, to give Rich time to find a replacement. The original Loveless was thus finally guaranteed for an autumn season run of "The Relapse". Since the loyal Verbruggen couple always moved as a unit, Susanna's services were also assured.

The Verbruggens were essential to the play, not least because Vanbrugh had customised the sprightly temptress Berinthia to Susanna's talents and reputation for witty, roguish, sexually enterprising characters, most recently Mrs Buxom in <a href="Thomas%20D%27Urfey">Thomas D'Urfey</a>'s "Don Quixote" (a success thanks to "the extraordinary well acting of Mrs Verbruggen", wrote D'Urfey). Although John was less well known, his acting skills were considerable and would flourish after January 1697 in the cooperative company, where commentators even started to compare him with the great Betterton. Verbruggen was considered a more natural, intuitive or "careless" actor, with "a negligent agreeable wildness in his action and his mien, which became him well." <a href="Anthony%20Aston">Anthony Aston</a> vividly described Verbruggen as "a little in-kneed, which gave him a shambling gait, which was a carelessness, and became him." Modern critics do not find the Loveless part very lively or irresistible, but Vanbrugh was able to count on Verbruggen's shambling male magnetism and "agreeable wildness" to enrich the character. This would originally have worked even in print, since cast lists were included in the published plays: most 1690s play readers were playgoers also, and aware of the high-profile Verbruggens. Happily married in private life and playing the secret lovers Loveless and Berinthia, the Verbruggens have left traces of their charisma and erotic stage presences in Vanbrugh's dialogue. "The Relapse" even alludes to their real-life relationship, in meta-jokes such as Berinthia's exclamation, "Well, he is a charming man! I don't wonder his wife's so fond of him!"
<a href="Hildebrand%20Horden">Hildebrand Horden</a>, who had played a "wild" young lover in "Love's Last Shift", was the only young, handsome, potential romantic lead Rich had. He was presumably cast by Vanbrugh as Tom Fashion, Lord Foppington's clever younger brother (Holland), and it was a blow to the Patent Company when he was killed in a tavern brawl (more glamorously referred to as a "duel" in older sources) in May. At the première in November, Tom Fashion was instead played as a <a href="breeches%20role">breeches role</a> by <a href="Mary%20Kent">Mary Kent</a>, an unusual piece of emergency casting that puts a different face on a uniquely frank homosexual scene where Tom keeps skipping nimbly out of the way of the <a href="matchmaking">matchmaker</a> Coupler's lecherous groping.

<a href="Colley%20Cibber">Colley Cibber</a> was a rather unsuccessful young actor at the time of the split, with a squeaky voice and without any of the physical attractiveness of the soon-to-be-dead Horden. After the success of "Love's Last Shift", his status was transformed, with both companies vying for his services as actor and playwright. He made an off-season transfer to Betterton's company in the summer of 1696 and wrote part of a play for the rebels before being re-seduced by Rich by means of a fat contract (Milhous). Cibber as Lord Foppington was thus also assured, and finally the première of "The Relapse" could be scheduled with some confidence. Cibber's performance in it was received with even greater acclaim than in his own play, Vanbrugh's Lord Foppington being a larger and, in the estimation of both contemporaries and modern critics, much funnier part than Sir Novelty Fashion. Vanbrugh's play incorporates some of the ad-libbing and affectations of Cibber's by all accounts inspired performance in "Love's Last Shift". Cibber has thus imprinted not only his own playwriting but also his acting style and squeaky personality on Vanbrugh's best-known character.

Vanbrugh's <a href="preface">preface</a> to the <a href="first%20edition">first edition</a> preserves a single fleeting concrete detail about the première performance: <a href="George%20Powell%20%28playwright%29">George Powell</a> was drunk. He played Amanda's worldly and sophisticated admirer Worthy, the "fine gentleman of the play", and apparently brought an unintended hands-on realism to his supposedly suave seduction attempt:

One word more about the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, but it was not my fault. The fine gentleman of the play, drinking his mistress's health in <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a> brandy from six in the morning to the time he waddled upon the stage in the evening, had toasted himself up to such a pitch of vigour, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone.

The desperate straits of the United Company, and the success of "The Relapse" in saving it from collapse, are attested in a private letter from 19 November 1696: "The other house [Drury Lane] has no company at all, and unless a new play comes out on Saturday revives their reputation, they must break." The new play is assumed to have been "The Relapse", and it turned out the success Rich needed. "This play", notes Colley Cibber in his autobiography, "from its new and easy turn of wit, had great success, and gave me, as a comedian, a second flight of reputation along with it." <a href="Charles%20Gildon">Charles Gildon</a> summarises: "This play was received with mighty applause."

"The Relapse" is singled out for particular censure in the <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> clergyman <a href="Jeremy%20Collier">Jeremy Collier</a>'s anti-theatre <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a> "<a href="Short%20View%20of%20the%20Immorality%20and%20Profaneness%20of%20the%20English%20Stage">Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage</a>" (1698), which attacks its lack of <a href="poetic%20justice">poetic justice</a> and moral sentiment. Worthy and Berinthia, complains Collier, are allowed to enact their wiles against the Lovelesses' married virtue without being punished or losing face. The subplot is an even worse offence against religion and morality, as it positively rewards <a href="vice">vice</a>, allowing the trickster hero Tom to keep the girl, her dowry, and his own bad character to the end. Vanbrugh failed to take "Short View" seriously and published a joking reply, but Collier's censure was to colour the perception of the play for centuries. While it remained a popular stage piece through the 18th century, much praised and enjoyed for its wit, attitudes to its casual sexual morality became increasingly ambivalent as public opinion became ever more restrictive in this area, and more at odds with the permissive ethos of Restoration comedy. From 1777 Vanbrugh's original was replaced on the stage by <a href="Richard%20Brinsley%20Sheridan">Sheridan</a>'s "A Trip to Scarborough", a close adaptation but with some "covering", as the <a href="prologue">prologue</a> explains, drawn over Vanbrugh's "too bare" wit:

Sheridan does not allow Loveless and Berinthia to <a href="consummation">consummate</a> their relationship, and he withdraws approval from Amanda's admirer Worthy by renaming him "Townly". Some frank quips are silently deleted, and the matchmaker Coupler with the lecherous interest in Tom becomes decorous Mrs Coupler. A small-scale but notable loss is of much of the graphic language of Hoyden's nurse, who is earthy in Vanbrugh's original, genteel in Sheridan. However, Sheridan had an appreciation of Vanbrugh's style, and retained most of the original text unaltered.

In the 19th century, "A Trip to Scarborough" remained the standard version, and there were also some ad hoc adaptations that sidelined the Lovelesses' drawing-room comedy in favour of the Lord Foppington/Hoyden plot with its caricatured clashes between exquisite fop and pitchfork-wielding country bumpkins. "The Man of Quality" (1870) was one such robust production, "Miss Tomboy" (1890) another. Vanbrugh's original "Relapse" was staged once, in 1846, at the <a href="Olympic%20Theatre">Olympic Theatre</a> in London.

During the first half of the 20th century "The Relapse" was relatively neglected, along with other <a href="Restoration%20drama">Restoration drama</a>, and experts are uncertain about exactly when Vanbrugh's original again resurged to prominence on the stage and thereby marginalised Sheridan's version. These experts now believe the play may have been first brilliantly rehabilitated by <a href="Anthony%20Quayle">Anthony Quayle</a>'s 1947 production at the Phoenix Theatre, starring <a href="Cyril%20Ritchard">Cyril Ritchard</a> as Lord Foppington and brought to Broadway by Ritchard in 1950. A <a href="musical%20theater">musical</a> version, "Virtue in Danger" (1963), by <a href="Paul%20Dehn">Paul Dehn</a> and "John Bernard", opened to mixed reviews. <a href="John%20Russell%20Taylor">John Russell Taylor</a> in "Plays and Players" praised the cast, which included <a href="Patricia%20Routledge">Patricia Routledge</a> as Berinthia and <a href="John%20Moffatt%20%28actor%29">John Moffatt</a> as Lord Foppington, but complained that the production was "full of the simpering, posturing and sniggering which usually stand in for style and sophistication in Restoration revivals." Following <a href="Donald%20Sinden">Donald Sinden</a>'s outstanding and award-winning performance at the <a href="Aldwych%20Theatre">Aldwych Theatre</a> in the mid-1960s Vanbrugh's original play is now again a favourite of the stage. A 2001 revival by <a href="Trevor%20Nunn">Trevor Nunn</a> at the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a> was described by <a href="Sheridan%20Morley">Sheridan Morley</a> as "rare, loving and brilliantly cast." As so often with commentary on "The Relapse", Morley focused on the role of Lord Foppington and its different <a href="Interpretation%20%28aesthetics%29">interpretation</a>s: "<a href="Alex%20Jennings">Alex Jennings</a> superbly inherits the role of Lord Foppington which for 20 years or so belonged to <a href="Donald%20Sinden">Donald Sinden</a>, and for another 20 before that to <a href="Cyril%20Ritchard">Cyril Ritchard</a>."

"Restoration Comedy", a play by <a href="Amy%20Freed">Amy Freed</a> that draws on both "The Relapse" and its predecessor, Colley Cibber's "<a href="Love%27s%20Last%20Shift">Love's Last Shift</a>", premiered at <a href="Seattle%20Repertory%20Theatre">Seattle Repertory Theatre</a> in 2005, starring <a href="Stephen%20Caffrey">Stephen Caffrey</a> as Loveless, <a href="Caralyn%20Kozlowski">Caralyn Kozlowski</a> as Amanda, and <a href="Jonathan%20Freeman%20%28actor%29">Jonathan Freeman</a> as Lord Foppington, and directed by <a href="Sharon%20Ott">Sharon Ott</a>.

Borscht

Borscht () is a <a href="sour%20soup">sour soup</a> common in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> and across Russia. The variety most often associated with the name in English is of <a href="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> origin, and includes <a href="beetroot">beetroot</a>s as one of the main ingredients, which gives the dish its distinctive red color. It shares the name, however, with a wide selection of sour-tasting soups without beetroots, such as <a href="sorrel">sorrel</a>-based <a href="Sorrel%20soup">green borscht</a>, <a href="rye">rye</a>-based <a href="Sour%20rye%20soup">white borscht</a> and <a href="cabbage">cabbage</a> borscht.

Borscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems, leaves and <a href="umbel">umbel</a>s of <a href="Heracleum%20sphondylium">common hogweed</a> ("Heracleum sphondylium"), a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a> name. With time, it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups, among which the beet-based red borscht has become the most popular. It is typically made by combining meat or bone <a href="Stock%20%28food%29">stock</a> with <a href="Saut%C3%A9ing">sautéed</a> vegetables, which – as well as beetroots – usually include cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Depending on the recipe, borscht may include meat or fish, or be purely vegetarian; it may be served either hot or cold; and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a clear broth or a smooth drink. It is often served with "<a href="Smetana%20%28dairy%20product%29">smetana</a>" or <a href="sour%20cream">sour cream</a>, hard-boiled eggs or potatoes, but there exists an ample choice of more involved <a href="Garnish%20%28food%29">garnishes</a> and side dishes, such as ' or ', that can be served with the soup. 

Its popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, and – by way of migration – to other continents. In North America, borscht is often linked with either Jews or <a href="Ethnic%20Mennonite">Mennonites</a>, the groups who first brought it there from Europe. Several ethnic groups claim borscht, in its various local guises, as their own <a href="national%20dish">national dish</a> consumed as part of ritual meals within <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a>, <a href="Ukrainian%20Greek%20Catholic%20Church">Greek Catholic</a>, <a href="Latin%20Church">Roman Catholic</a>, and Jewish religious traditions.

The English word "<a href="%3Awikt%3Aborscht">borscht</a>", also spelled "borsch", "borsht", or "bortsch", comes from <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> ('). The latter derives from the word ('), which is common to <a href="East%20Slavic%20languages">East Slavic languages</a>, such as <a href="Ukrainian%20language">Ukrainian</a> or <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>.

Together with <a href="cognate">cognate</a>s in other Slavic languages, it comes from <a href="Proto-Slavic%20language">Proto-Slavic</a> "*bŭrščǐ" 'hogweed' and ultimately from <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> "*bhr̥sti-" < "*bhares-/bhores-" 'point, stubble'. <a href="Heracleum%20sphondylium">Common hogweed</a> ("") was the soup's principal ingredient before it was replaced with other vegetables, notably beetroot. The beetroot borscht was invented in what is now Ukraine and first popularized in North America by Yiddish-speaking <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a> from <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>.

Typical Ukrainian borscht is traditionally made from meat or bone <a href="Stock%20%28food%29">stock</a>, <a href="Saut%C3%A9ing">sautéed</a> vegetables, and beet sour (i.e., fermented <a href="beetroot">beetroot</a> juice). Depending on the recipe, some of these components may be omitted or substituted for.
The stock is typically made by boiling meat, bones, or both. <a href="Beef">Beef</a>, <a href="pork">pork</a> or a combination of both are most commonly used, with <a href="brisket">brisket</a>, <a href="Ribs%20%28food%29">ribs</a>, <a href="Shank%20%28meat%29">shank</a> and <a href="Chuck%20steak">chuck</a> considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. <a href="Bone%20marrow%20%28food%29">Marrow bones</a> are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked for about two hours, whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for <a href="smoked%20meat">smoked meat</a>s, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. <a href="Fasting">Fasting</a> varieties are typically made with <a href="Fish%20stock%20%28food%29">fish stock</a> to avoid the use of meat, while purely <a href="Vegetarianism">vegetarian</a> recipes often substitute forest <a href="Edible%20mushroom">mushroom</a> broth for the stock.

The vegetables most commonly added to borscht are beetroots, <a href="white%20cabbage">white cabbage</a>, <a href="carrot">carrot</a>s, <a href="parsley%20root">parsley root</a>, <a href="potato">potato</a>es, <a href="onion">onion</a>s and <a href="tomato">tomato</a>es. Some recipes may also call for <a href="bean">bean</a>s, <a href="Cooking%20apple">tart apples</a>, <a href="turnip">turnip</a>, <a href="celeriac">celeriac</a>, <a href="zucchini">zucchini</a> or <a href="bell%20pepper">bell pepper</a>s. <a href="Parsnip">Parsnip</a> may be used as a substitute for parsley root, and <a href="tomato%20paste">tomato paste</a> is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes. The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables – by sautéing, <a href="braising">braising</a>, <a href="Boiling%23In%20cooking">boiling</a> or <a href="baking">baking</a> – separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of <a href="Low-temperature%20cooking">slow cooking</a> in the <a href="Russian%20oven">Russian oven</a> (traditional <a href="Masonry%20heater">masonry stove</a>, used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had to be taken into account in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form ' rather than '. Vegetables are usually <a href="Julienning">julienned</a>, except for potatoes and zucchini, which are <a href="Dicing">diced</a>. The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with <a href="vinegar">vinegar</a> or <a href="lemon%20juice">lemon juice</a> to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed (traditionally in animal fat, especially <a href="lard">lard</a> or <a href="butter">butter</a>) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste. Dry beans are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.
The dominant tastes in borscht are sweet and sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour. It is made by covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> to <a href="fermentation">ferment</a> some of the <a href="sugar">sugar</a>s present in beetroots into <a href="dextran">dextran</a> (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), <a href="mannitol">mannitol</a>, <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> and <a href="lactic%20acid">lactic acid</a>. Stale <a href="rye%20bread">rye bread</a> is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as "<a href="chametz">chametz</a>" (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for <a href="Passover">Passover</a> meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2–5 days (or 2–3 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate. The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as "kvas" (literally 'sour, acid'; compare <a href="kvass">kvass</a>) and in Yiddish as ' (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian ' 'pickle juice', Polish "" 'broth'). Apart from its employment in borscht, it may be also added to prepared <a href="horseradish">horseradish</a> or used as <a href="pot%20roast">pot roast</a> marinade.

As the traditional method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning at least several days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or <a href="citric%20acid">citric acid</a>, tomatoes, tart apples, <a href="Dryness%20%28taste%29">dry</a> <a href="red%20wine">red wine</a>, <a href="dill%20pickle">dill pickle</a> juice, <a href="sauerkraut">sauerkraut</a> juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with a wide selection of herbs, spices and condiments. <a href="Salt">Salt</a>, <a href="black%20pepper">black pepper</a>, <a href="garlic">garlic</a>, <a href="Laurus%20nobilis">bay leaves</a> and <a href="dill">dill</a> are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include <a href="allspice">allspice</a>, <a href="celery">celery</a> stalks, <a href="parsley">parsley</a>, <a href="marjoram">marjoram</a>, <a href="hot%20pepper">hot pepper</a>s, <a href="saffron">saffron</a>, horseradish, <a href="ginger">ginger</a> and <a href="prune">prune</a>s. Some recipes require flour or <a href="roux">roux</a> to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.

As the home country of beetroot borscht, <a href="Ukrainian%20cuisine">Ukraine</a> boasts great diversity of the soup's regional variants, with virtually every <a href="Oblasts%20of%20Ukraine">province</a> having its own recipe. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a> variant uses <a href="Lamb%20and%20mutton">mutton or lamb</a> as well as beef, while in the <a href="Poltava">Poltava</a> region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, <a href="Chicken%20%28food%29">chicken</a>, <a href="Duck%20%28food%29">duck</a> or <a href="Domestic%20goose">goose</a>. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the <a href="Chernihiv">Chernihiv</a> borscht; in this variant, beetroots are sautéed in <a href="vegetable%20oil">vegetable oil</a> rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The <a href="Lviv">Lviv</a> borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of <a href="Vienna%20sausage">Vienna sausage</a>s.

Many regional recipes for borscht have also developed in <a href="Russian%20cuisine">Russian cuisine</a>. Examples include the <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> borscht, served with pieces of beef, ham and Vienna sausages; <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>n borscht with <a href="meatball">meatball</a>s; and <a href="Pskov">Pskov</a> borscht with dried <a href="European%20smelt">smelt</a> from the local lakes. Other unique Russian variants include a monastic <a href="Lent">Lent</a>en borscht with marinated <a href="kelp">kelp</a> instead of cabbage and the <a href="Russian%20Navy">Russian Navy</a> borscht ("), the defining characteristic of which is that the vegetables are cut into square or diamond-shaped chunks rather than julienned.
As well as the thick borschts described above, <a href="Polish%20cuisine">Polish cuisine</a> offers a ruby-colored beetroot bouillon known as ', or clear red borscht. It is made by combining strained meat-and-vegetable stock with wild mushroom broth and beet sour. In some versions, smoked meat may be used for the stock and the tartness may be obtained or enhanced by adding lemon juice, dill pickle brine, or dry red wine. It may be served either in a soup bowl or – especially at dinner parties – as a hot beverage in a twin-handled cup, with a <a href="croquette">croquette</a> or a filled pastry on the side. Unlike other types of borscht, it is not whitened with <a href="sour%20cream">sour cream</a>. ', or <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a> borscht, is a variant of the clear borscht that is traditionally served during the Polish <a href="Wigilia">Christmas Eve supper</a>. In this version, meat stock is either omitted or replaced with fish broth, usually made by boiling the heads cut off from fish used in other Christmas Eve dishes. The mushrooms used for cooking the mushroom broth are reserved for " (small filled dumplings), which are then served with the borscht.

Ashkenazi Jews living in Eastern Europe adopted beetroot borscht from their Slavic neighbors and adapted it to <a href="Jewish%20cuisine">their taste</a> and religious requirements. As <a href="Milk%20and%20meat%20in%20Jewish%20law">combining meat with milk is proscribed</a> by <a href="kosher">kosher</a> dietary laws, Jews have developed two variants of the soup: meat (') and dairy ('). The meat variant is typically made from beef brisket (pork is never used) and cabbage, while the dairy one is vegetarian, blended with sour cream or a mixture of milk and egg yolks. Both variants typically contain beetroots and onions, and are flavored with beet sour, vinegar or citric acid for tartness and <a href="beet%20sugar">beet sugar</a> for sweetness. <a href="Galician%20Jews">Galician Jews</a> traditionally liked their borscht particularly sweet. Jewish borscht may be served either hot or cold, typically with a hot boiled potato on the side. In prewar Eastern Europe it was traditionally put up to ferment around <a href="Purim">Purim</a> so that it would be ready four weeks later for the Passover holiday.

In the summertime, cold borscht is a popular alternative to the aforementioned variants, which are normally served hot. It consists of beet sour or beet juice blended with sour cream, <a href="buttermilk">buttermilk</a>, <a href="soured%20milk">soured milk</a>, <a href="kefir">kefir</a> or <a href="yogurt">yogurt</a>. The mixture has a distinctive pink or magenta color. It is served refrigerated, typically over finely chopped beetroot, <a href="cucumber">cucumber</a>s, <a href="radish">radish</a>es and <a href="green%20onion">green onion</a>, together with halves of a hard-boiled egg and sprinkled with fresh dill. Chopped <a href="veal">veal</a>, ham, or <a href="Crayfish%20as%20food">crawfish tails</a> may be added as well. 

This soup probably originated in the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>, which comprised the territories of modern-day Lithuania and Belarus, and it is still part of the culinary traditions of these and neighboring nations. The Lithuanian language is the only one in the region which actually refers to it as 'cold borscht' ('). In Belarusian it is known simply as ', or 'cold soup'; in Polish as "chłodnik litewski", or 'Lithuanian cold soup'; and in Russian as "", or 'beetroot soup'.

Although in the English language "borscht" refers almost invariably to a beet-based soup, in some culinary cultures there exist soups with the same or similar names where beetroots are absent or merely optional. The principal common trait among them is a tart flavor obtained by adding various sour-tasting ingredients.

<a href="Sorrel%20soup">Green borscht</a> ("), a light soup made from leaf vegetables, is an example common in Ukrainian and Russian cuisines. The naturally tart-tasting <a href="sorrel">sorrel</a> is most commonly used, but <a href="spinach">spinach</a>, <a href="chard">chard</a>, <a href="Urtica%20dioica">nettle</a>, <a href="Atriplex%20hortensis">garden orache</a> and occasionally <a href="Taraxacum%20officinale">dandelion</a>, <a href="Aegopodium%20podagraria">goutweed</a> or <a href="Allium%20ursinum">ramsons</a>, may be added as well, especially after the spring season for sorrel has passed. Like beetroot borscht, it is based on meat or vegetable broth and is typically served with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs, sprinkled with dill. There is also a variety of Ukrainian green borscht which includes both sorrel and beetroots.

In Polish cuisine, <a href="Sour%20rye%20soup">white borscht</a> (', also known as ' or ", 'sour soup') is made from a fermented mixture of <a href="rye">rye</a> flour or <a href="oatmeal">oatmeal</a> and water. It is typically flavored with garlic and marjoram, and served over eggs and boiled fresh sausage; the water in which the sausage was boiled is often used instead of meat stock. 
In the <a href="Carpathian%20Mountains">Carpathian Mountains</a> of southern Poland, variants of borscht are also made in which the tart taste comes from dairy products, such as <a href="whey">whey</a> or buttermilk. Although the deep red color of beetroot borscht may remind those unfamiliar with Polish cuisine of blood, the kind of borscht that does contain animal (usually poultry) blood mixed with vinegar is dark brownish-gray in color and aptly called "gray borscht" ('), which is a regional name of the Polish blood soup better known as '.

In <a href="Romanian%20cuisine">Romanian</a> and <a href="Moldovan%20cuisine">Moldovan cuisine</a>s, a mixture of <a href="wheat">wheat</a> <a href="bran">bran</a> or <a href="cornmeal">cornmeal</a> with water that has been left to ferment, similar to, but less cloudy than that used in Polish white borscht, is called '. It is used to impart a sour taste to a variety of tangy Romanian soups, known as either also ' or '. Variants include ' (with meatballs), ' (with <a href="tripe">tripe</a>), ' (with fish) and " (with beetroots).
The <a href="Armenian%20cuisine">Armenian</a> version of borscht is a hot soup made with beef stock, green peppers and other vegetables, which may or may not include beetroots, and flavored with parsley and <a href="cilantro">cilantro</a>. In <a href="ethnic%20Mennonite">ethnic Mennonite</a> cuisine, "borscht" refers to a whole range of seasonal vegetable soups based on beef or chicken stock – from spring borscht made with spinach, sorrel and chard to summer borscht with cabbage, tomatoes, <a href="corn">corn</a> and <a href="Cucurbita">squash</a> to fall and winter borscht with cabbage, beets and potatoes. In <a href="Chinese%20cuisine">Chinese cuisine</a>, a soup known as ", or "Russian soup", is based on red cabbage and tomatoes, and lacks beetroots altogether; also known as "Chinese borscht", it originated in <a href="Harbin">Harbin</a>, close to the Russian border in northeast China, and has spread as far as <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>. In <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>'s <a href="Haipai%20cuisine">Haipai cuisine</a>, tomatoes are the main ingredient; beef and its broth, onions and cabbages are also added, while flour, rather than sour cream, is used for thickening.

The diversity of borscht styles is matched by the wide choice of garnishes and side dishes with which various kinds of borscht may be served.
Most often, borscht is served with sour cream, the East European version of which, known as ", is runnier than its American counterpart. The sour cream may be served in a separate pitcher for the diners to add the desired amount themselves or the borscht may come already "whitened", that is, blended with sour cream. Sometimes the cream is thickened with flour before being added to the soup. Yogurt and a mixture of milk and <a href="yolk">yolk</a>s are possible substitutes.

Chopped herbs are often sprinkled on the surface of the soup; dill is most common, but parsley, <a href="chives">chives</a> or <a href="scallion">scallion</a> are often added as well. Individual helpings may be spiced up with minced hot peppers or garlic. Many kinds of borscht are served over halves or quarters of hard-boiled <a href="Egg%20%28food%29">chicken</a> or <a href="quail%20eggs">quail eggs</a>. <a href="Navy%20beans">Navy beans</a>, <a href="broad%20beans">broad beans</a> or <a href="string%20beans">string beans</a> are also a common addition.
Meat, removed from the stock on which the borscht was based, may be cut into smaller chunks and either added back into the soup or served on the side with horseradish or <a href="Mustard%20%28condiment%29">mustard</a>. <a href="Bacon">Bacon</a> and sausages are also commonly used as borscht garnishes. Borscht based on bone stock may be served Old Polish style, with marrow from the bones.

Some kinds of the soup, such as Poltava borscht, may be served with "<a href="Halu%C5%A1ky"></a>," or thick noodles of wheat or buckwheat flour. Siberian borscht is eaten with boiled meatballs (') of minced beef and onion. In Poland and parts of western Ukraine, borscht is typically ladled over ', or bite-sized ear-shaped dumplings made from <a href="pasta">pasta</a> dough wrapped around mushroom, buckwheat or meat filling. Mushroom-filled " are particularly associated with Polish Christmas Eve borscht.

Borscht, like any other soup in East Slavic cuisines, is seldom eaten by itself, but rather accompanied by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread. <a href="Buckwheat">Buckwheat</a> groats or boiled potatoes, often topped with <a href="Pork%20rind">pork cracklings</a>, are other simple possibilities, but a range of more involved sides exists as well.
In Ukraine, borscht is often accompanied with ', or savory, puffy yeast-raised rolls glazed with <a href="Cooking%20oil">oil</a> and crushed garlic. In Russian cuisine, borscht may be served with any of assorted side dishes based on ', or the East European variant of <a href="farmer%20cheese">farmer cheese</a>, such as ', ' or '. ' are baked round cheese-filled tarts; ' are small pancakes wherein the cheese is mixed into the batter; and a ' is a casserole of buckwheat groats baked with cheese.

', or baked dumplings with fillings as for ', are another common side for both thick and clear variants of borscht. Polish clear borscht may be also served with a croquette or '. A typical Polish croquette (') is made by wrapping a ' (thin pancake) around a filling and coating it in <a href="breadcrumbs">breadcrumbs</a> before refrying; ' (literally, 'little ') are variously shaped filled hand-held pastries of yeast-raised or flaky dough. An even more exquisite way to serve borscht is with a <a href="coulibiac">coulibiac</a>, or a large loaf-shaped pie. Possible fillings for croquettes, ' and coulibiacs include mushrooms, sauerkraut and minced meat.

Borscht derives from a soup originally made by the <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a> from <a href="Heracleum%20sphondylium">common hogweed</a> (", also known as cow parsnip), which lent the dish its <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a> name. Growing commonly in damp meadows throughout the north temperate zone, hogweed was used not only as fodder (as its English names suggest), but also for human consumption – from Eastern Europe to Siberia, to northwestern North America.

The Slavs collected hogweed in May and used its roots for stewing with meat, while the stems, leaves and <a href="umbel">umbel</a>s were chopped, covered with water and left in a warm place to ferment. After a few days, <a href="lactic%20fermentation">lactic</a> and <a href="Ethanol%20fermentation">alcoholic fermentation</a> produced a mixture described as "something between <a href="beer">beer</a> and sauerkraut". This concoction was then used for cooking a soup characterized by a mouth-puckering sour taste and pungent smell. As the Polish <a href="Ethnography">ethnographer</a> wrote in 1830, "Poles have been always partial to tart dishes, which are somewhat peculiar to their homeland and vital to their health."

The earliest written reference to the Slavic hogweed soup can be found in "" ("Domestic Order"), a 16th-century Russian compendium of moral rules and homemaking advice. It recommends growing the plant "by the fence, around the whole garden, where the nettle grows", to cook a soup of it in springtime and reminds the reader to, "for the Lord's sake, share it with those in need". <a href="Simon%20Syrenius">Simon Syrenius</a> (), a 17th-century Polish botanist, described "our Polish hogweed" as a vegetable that was well known throughout Poland, <a href="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Lithuania</a> and <a href="Samogitia">Samogitia</a> (that is, most of the northern part of Eastern Europe), typically used for cooking a "tasty and graceful soup" with <a href="capon">capon</a> stock, eggs, sour cream and <a href="millet">millet</a>. More interested in the plant's medicinal properties than its culinary use, he also recommended pickled hogweed juice as a cure for fever or hangover.

Hogweed borscht was mostly a poor man's food. The soup's humble beginnings are still reflected in Polish fixed expressions, where "cheap like borscht" is the equivalent of "dirt cheap" (also attested as a <a href="calque">calque</a> in Yiddish and <a href="Canadian%20English">Canadian English</a>), whereas adding "two mushrooms into borscht" is synonymous with excess. For the professors of the <a href="Jagiellonian%20University">University of Kraków</a>, who led a monastic way of life in the 17th century, hogweed borscht was a fasting dish which they ate regularly (sometimes with <a href="deviled%20egg">deviled egg</a>s) from Lent till <a href="Rogation%20days">Rogation days</a>. It was uncommon on the royal table, although according to the 16th-century Polish botanist <a href="Marcin%20of%20Urz%C4%99d%C3%B3w">Marcin of Urzędów</a> – citing , a court physician to the <a href="Jagiellonian%20dynasty">Jagiellonian</a> kings of Hungary – the Polish-born King <a href="Vladislaus%20II%20of%20Hungary">Vladislaus II</a> used to have a Polish hogweed-based dish prepared for him at his court in <a href="Buda">Buda</a>.

With time, other ingredients were added to the soup, eventually replacing hogweed altogether, and the names ' or ' became generic terms for any sour-tasting soup. In 19th-century rural Poland, this term included soups made from <a href="Berberis%20vulgaris">barberries</a>, <a href="Ribes">currants</a>, <a href="Gooseberry">gooseberries</a>, <a href="Cranberry">cranberries</a>, celery or <a href="plum">plum</a>s.
When describing the uses of common hogweed, <a href="John%20Gerard">John Gerard</a>, a 17th-century English botanist, observed that "the people of [Poland] and Lithuania [used] to make [a] drink with the decoction of this herb and <a href="sourdough">leaven</a> or some other thing made of <a href="flour">meal</a>, which is used instead of beer and other ordinary drink." It may suggest that hogweed soup was on some occasions combined with a fermented mixture of water and <a href="barley">barley</a> flour, oatmeal or rye flour. Such soured, gelatinous flour-and-water mixture, originally known as <a href="kissel">kissel</a> (from the Proto-Slavic root "*kyslŭ", 'sour') had been already mentioned in "<a href="Primary%20Chronicle">The Tale of Bygone Years</a>", a 12th-century chronicle of <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a>, and continued to be a staple of Ukrainian and Russian cooking until the middle of the 19th century. In Poland, a soup based on diluted kissel became known as either ' (from <a href="Middle%20High%20German">Middle High German</a> ' 'sour') or ' and later – to distinguish it from the red beetroot borscht – as ' 'white borscht'.

The earliest known Polish recipes for borscht, written by chefs catering to Polish <a href="Magnates%20of%20Poland%20and%20Lithuania">magnates</a> (aristocrats), are from the late 17th century. , head chef to Prince , included several borscht recipes in his ' ("A Collection of Dishes"), the first cookbook published originally in Polish, in 1682. They include such sour soups as lemon borscht and "royal borscht", the latter made from assorted dried, smoked or fresh fish and fermented rye bran. A manuscript recipe collection from the family court, dating back to ca. 1686, contains an instruction for making hogweed borscht mixed with <a href="poppy%20seeds">poppy seeds</a> or ground <a href="almond">almond</a>s. As this was a Lenten dish, it was garnished, in a ' fashion typical of <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> cuisine, with mock eggs made from finely chopped <a href="Northern%20pike">pike</a> that was partly dyed with saffron and formed into oval balls. An alternative recipe for the almond borscht replaced pickled hogweed with vinegar.
Borscht also evolved into a variety of sour soups to the east of Poland. Examples include onion borscht, a recipe for which was included in a 1905 Russian cookbook, and sorrel-based green borscht, which is still a popular summer soup in Ukraine and Russia. "<a href="A%20Gift%20to%20Young%20Housewives">A Gift to Young Housewives</a>" by <a href="Elena%20Molokhovets">Elena Molokhovets</a>, the best-selling Russian cookbook of the 19th century, first published in 1861, contains nine recipes for borscht, some of which are based on kvass, a traditional Slavic fermented beverage made from rye bread. Kvass-based variants were also known in Ukraine at that time; some of them were types of green borscht, while others were similar to the Russian "".

Before the advent of beet-based borscht, cabbage borscht was of particular importance. Made from either fresh cabbage or sauerkraut, it could be indistinguishable from the Russian '. Indeed, the mid-19th-century "<a href="Explanatory%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20Living%20Great%20Russian%20Language">Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language</a>" defines ' as "a kind of """ with beet sour added for tartness. The significance of cabbage as an essential ingredient of borscht is manifest in the Ukrainian proverb, "without bread, it's no lunch; without cabbage, it's no borscht."

Beet ('), a plant native to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean Basin</a>, was already grown in antiquity. Only the leaves were of culinary use, as the tapered, tough, whitish and bitter-tasting root was considered unfit for human consumption. It is likely that beet greens were used in variants of green borscht long before the invention of the beetroot-based red borscht. Beet <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> with round, red, sweet <a href="taproot">taproot</a>s, known as beetroots, were not reliably reported until the 12th century and did not spread to Eastern Europe before the 16th century. , a <a href="Renaissance%20in%20Poland">Polish Renaissance</a> poet and moralist, included the earliest known Polish recipe for pickled beetroots in his 1568 book, "Life of an Honest Man". It would later evolve into ', or ", a beet-and-horseradish relish popular in Polish and Jewish cuisines. also recommended the "very tasty brine" left over from beetroot pickling, which was an early version of beet sour. The sour found some applications in Polish folk medicine as a cure for hangover and – mixed with honey – as a sore throat remedy.

It may never be known who first thought of using beet sour to flavor borscht, which also gave the soup its now-familiar red color. 's Polish-German dictionary published in 1806 was the first to define " as a tart soup made from pickled beetroots. The fact that certain 19th-century Russian and Polish cookbooks, such as "Handbook of the Experienced Russian Housewife" (1842) by and "The Lithuanian Cook" (1854) by , refer to beetroot-based borscht as "Little Russian borscht" (where "<a href="Little%20Russia">Little Russia</a>n" is a term used at the time for ethnic <a href="Ukrainians">Ukrainians</a> under <a href="Russian%20Empire">imperial Russian</a> rule) suggests that this innovation took place in what is now Ukraine, whose soils and climate are particularly well suited to beet cultivation. Ukrainian legends, probably of 19th-century origin, attribute the invention of beetroot borscht either to <a href="Zaporozhian%20Cossacks">Zaporozhian Cossacks</a>, serving in the Polish army, on their way to break the <a href="battle%20of%20Vienna">siege of Vienna</a> in 1683, or to <a href="Don%20Cossacks">Don Cossacks</a>, serving in the Russian army, while <a href="Azov%20campaigns%20%281695%E2%80%9396%29">laying siege to Azov</a> in 1695.
Spanish <a href="conquistador">conquistador</a>s brought potatoes and tomatoes from the Americas to Europe in the 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern Europe in the 19th century. Eventually, both became staples of <a href="Peasant%20foods">peasant diet</a> and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht. Potatoes replaced turnips in borscht recipes, and tomatoes – fresh, canned or paste – took over from beet sour as the source of tartness. The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes, and even then, together with potatoes. In Ukraine, beet sour and tomatoes were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century.

Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, borscht's popularity spread beyond its Slavic homeland, largely due to such factors as territorial expansion of the Russian Empire, Russia's growing political clout and cultural stature, and waves of emigration out of the country. As Russia grew to cover most of northern and central Eurasia, borscht was introduced to the cuisines of various peoples inhabiting the territories both within and adjacent to the empire, from <a href="Finnish%20cuisine">Finland</a> to the <a href="List%20of%20dishes%20from%20the%20Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and <a href="Iranian%20cuisine">Iran</a>, to <a href="Central%20Asian%20cuisine">Central Asia</a> and China, to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> (<a href="Russian%20America">Russian America</a>).
Borscht's westward expansion was less successful; Germans used to scoff at the soup along with other East European fare. What helped familiarize Western Europe with borscht was the practice of Russian emperors, as well as Russian and Polish aristocrats, to employ celebrated French chefs, who later presented their own versions of the dish as a foreign curiosity back in France. One of the first French chefs to do so was , who worked briefly for Emperor <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Alexander I</a> in 1819. In his take on borscht, the original Russian soup served only as inspiration for an extravagant ' dish with an air of eastern exoticism. Apart from vegetables and beet sour, his recipe calls for a roast chicken, a fried chicken, a duck, a piece of veal, an <a href="oxtail">oxtail</a>, a marrow bone, one pound of bacon, and six large sausages, and suggests serving with beef <a href="quenelle">quenelle</a>s, deviled eggs and <a href="cro%C3%BBton">croûton</a>s. , 's apprentice, who was mostly fascinated by the soup's vivid ruby-red color, simplified his master's recipe, while also securing the place of ' ("borscht soup") in French cuisine. and , both of whom had been employed at Polish aristocratic courts, presented borscht to the French public as a Polish soup; their cookbook, ', published in 1856, contains a borscht recipe under the descriptive name, ' ("Polish-style beet-juice soup"), which had been changed to "" by the third edition in 1868. In 1867, beetroot borscht was served, along with <a href="herring">herring</a>s, <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a>, coulibiac, <a href="Pozharsky%20cutlet">Pozharsky cutlet</a>s and <a href="Vinegret">vinaigrette salad</a>, at a Russian-themed dinner at the <a href="International%20Exposition%20%281867%29">International Exposition</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, strengthening its international association with Russian culture.

Mass migration from the Russian Empire to North America – initially mostly by members of persecuted religious minorities – was instrumental in bringing borscht across the Atlantic. The earliest waves of migration occurred at a time when cabbage-based borscht was still the dominant variant of the soup in at least parts of Russia. The Mennonites, who began arriving in Canada and the United States from Russia's <a href="Volga%20region">Volga region</a> in the 1870s, still eschew beetroots in their borscht; instead, Mennonite varieties include ' (with cabbage or sauerkraut) and ' (sorrel-based "summer borscht"). According to the "<a href="Jewish%20Encyclopedia">Jewish Encyclopedia</a>" published in 1906, cabbage-based "kraut borscht" was also more popular than the beet-based variant in <a href="American%20Jewish%20cuisine">American Jewish cuisine</a> at the time. Subsequent Jewish immigration helped popularize the red borscht in America.
In the 1930s, when most American hotels refused to accept Jewish guests due to widespread <a href="antisemitism%20in%20the%20United%20States">anti-Semitism</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> Jews began flocking to Jewish-owned resorts in the <a href="Catskill%20Mountains">Catskill Mountains</a> for their summer vacations. The area grew into a major center of Jewish entertainment, with restaurants offering <a href="Buffet%23All-you-can-eat%20%28AYCE%29">all-you-can-eat</a> Ashkenazi Jewish fare, including copious amounts of borscht. <a href="Grossinger%27s%20Catskill%20Resort%20Hotel">Grossinger's</a>, one of the largest resorts, served borscht throughout the day, every day of the year. The region became known, initially in derision, as the "<a href="Borscht%20Belt">Borscht Belt</a>", reinforcing the popular association between borscht and American Jewish culture. As most visitors arrived in the summertime, the borscht was typically served cold. Marc Gold was one of its largest suppliers, producing 1,750 <a href="short%20ton">short ton</a>s (1,590 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s) a year in his business's heyday. Gold's borscht consists of <a href="pur%C3%A9e">purée</a>d beetroots seasoned with sugar, salt and citric acid; it is usually blended with sour cream and served as a refreshing beverage, more aptly described as a "beet <a href="smoothie">smoothie</a>". Such kind of "purplish, watery broth" is, according to Nikolai Burlakoff, author of "The World of Russian Borsch", "associated in America with borsch, in general, and Jewish borsch in particular."

In the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, borscht was one of the most popular everyday dishes. It was described by <a href="James%20Meek%20%28author%29">James Meek</a>, a British correspondent in Kiev and Moscow, as "the common denominator of the <a href="Soviet%20cuisine">Soviet kitchen</a>, the dish that tied together ... the high table of <a href="Moscow%20Kremlin">the Kremlin</a> and the meanest canteen in the boondocks of the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Urals</a>, ... the beetroot soup that pumped like a main artery through the kitchens of the <a href="East%20Slavs">east Slav</a> lands". Among Soviet leaders, the Ukrainian-born <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> was especially partial to borscht, which his wife continued to personally cook for him even after they had moved into the Kremlin.
The soup has even played a role in the <a href="Soviet%20space%20program">Soviet space program</a>. In March 1961, as part of a communications equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the <a href="Korabl-Sputnik%204">Korabl-Sputnik 4</a> spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and <a href="Ivan%20Ivanovich%20%28Vostok%20programme%29">a mannequin</a>, had been launched into <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a> in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as <a href="space%20food">space food</a> for Soviet and, later, Russian <a href="cosmonaut">cosmonaut</a>s. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, <a href="Sterilization%20%28microbiology%29">sterilized</a>, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and <a href="autoclave">autoclave</a>d. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable <a href="Freeze-drying">freeze-dried</a> borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.

Borscht is often associated with its role in religious traditions of various denominations (<a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a>, <a href="Ukrainian%20Greek%20Catholic%20Church">Greek</a> and <a href="Latin%20Church">Roman Catholic</a>, and <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a>) that are common in Eastern Europe. In East Slavic countries, "memorial borscht" is served as the first course at a <a href="Wake%20%28ceremony%29">post-funeral wake</a>. According to a traditional belief, the soul of the departed either feeds on or is carried up to heaven by puffs of steam rising from bowls of borscht and other hot dishes, such as <a href="blini">blini</a>, <a href="Kasha">porridge</a>, boiled potatoes or freshly baked bread. In the region of <a href="Polesye">Polesye</a>, straddling the Belarusian-Ukrainian border, the same steaming-hot dishes, including borscht, are given as an offering to the souls of deceased ancestors during the annual semi-pagan remembrance ceremony known as " or Forefathers' Night.
In Poland and Ukraine, borscht is usually one of the dishes served at a <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a> dinner. Celebrated after the first star has appeared in the sky on December 24 (Roman Catholic) or January 6 (Greek Catholic), it is a meal which is at the same time festive and fasting, a multicourse affair (traditionally, with twelve distinct dishes) that excludes ingredients of land-animal origin. Christmas Eve borscht is, therefore, either vegetarian or based on fish stock and is not typically mixed with sour cream. In Ukraine, the soup contains vegetables that are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, as well as beans and mushrooms. It may be also thickened with wheat flour <a href="Dry%20roasting">dry-roasted</a> in a pan instead of the usual roux. The Polish version of Christmas Eve borscht is a clear ruby-red broth. Both Ukrainian and Polish variants are often served with ".

While Christmas in Poland is traditionally linked to red borscht, Lent – the fasting period that leads up to <a href="Easter">Easter</a> – is associated with a meatless version of white borscht, or ". Youths used to celebrate <a href="Holy%20Saturday">Holy Saturday</a>, the last day of the fast, with a mock "funeral" of the white borscht, in which a pot of the soup was either buried in the ground or broken, sometimes – to the crowd's amusement – while being carried by an unsuspecting boy on his head. On the next day, the white borscht would reappear on the Easter table, but this time, in its more coveted, meat-based guise with sausage, bacon and eggs.

In Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, vegetarian borscht served with sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side, known as ", is considered an essential dish during the Passover period. As the holiday is observed in spring (March or April), the preparation of Passover borscht used to provide an opportunity to use up the beet sour left over from pickled beetroots that had been consumed during winter, remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and sour cream that was readily available in the new calving season. Cold borscht blended with sour cream is also popular on <a href="Shavuot">Shavuot</a> (Feast of Weeks), a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June. <a href="Seudah%20Shlishit">Seudah Shlishit</a>, or the third meal of the <a href="Shabbat">Shabbat</a>, often includes borscht as well.

In its currently most popular, beet-based version, borscht most likely originated in what is now Ukraine. Borscht's role as a staple of everyday Ukrainian diet is reflected in the Ukrainian saying, "borscht and porridge are our food" (compare the equivalent Russian saying, where borscht is replaced with ""). The hearty soup in which the beetroot is just one of sundry vegetables, as opposed to the typically Polish clear beet broth, is still known in Poland as "Ukrainian borscht".

Borscht is associated with and claimed by several ethnic groups, especially Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews, as their own <a href="national%20dish">national or ethnic dish</a> and <a href="cultural%20icon">cultural icon</a>. Such claims are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as the soup's history predates the emergence in Eastern Europe of modern nation states with their ever-shifting borders. Borscht, in the words of Burlakoff, "is perfectly suited to a global culture." He describes it as "a global phenomenon", in which "local variants are so numerous and diverse that it is hard sometimes for a non-specialist to grasp that any single example of it is something that is part of a unified tradition." In his view, borscht "is an almost perfect example of ... '<a href="glocalization">glocalization</a>' – a phenomenon that is global in distribution but reflective of local needs and ways in its variants and adaptation; ... a highly localized product that became globalized, and in the process adapted to conditions other than the original ones." However, according to Irina Perianova, a Russian linguist and anthropologist, "people tend to be very proprietal about their food and proud of it." Perianova offers competing Russian and Ukrainian views on the origin and ingredients of borscht as an example of "a common connection between culinary and territorial claims", which results in the culinary area turning into "a battlefield generating and proliferating all kinds of myths."
In the Soviet Union, government-sponsored cookbooks, such as "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Tasty%20and%20Healthy%20Food">The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food</a>" curated by <a href="Anastas%20Mikoyan">Anastas Mikoyan</a>, "Cookery" and "Directory of Recipes and Culinary Production", promoted a unified Soviet cuisine with standardized and nutritionally "rational" versions of traditional dishes. The same cooking techniques and recipes were taught in culinary vocational schools throughout the country, establishing a common cooking style in Soviet cafés and restaurants. Though inspired by the cuisines of the country's various ethnic groups, many recipes were presented as part of an overall Soviet heritage, disassociated from their individual geographic origins. By many people both inside and outside the Soviet Union, borscht was increasingly seen not as an ethnic Ukrainian soup, but as a Soviet or – <a href="metonymy">metonymically</a> – Russian dish. This approach was criticized by <a href="William%20Pokhlebkin">William Pokhlebkin</a>, a preeminent Russian food writer, who unequivocally described beet-based borscht as one of the "dishes of Ukrainian cookery" which "have entered the menu of international cuisine". "One could understand", he wrote, "and forgive foreigners for calling borscht or "" Russian national dishes, but when it turns out that they gleaned the information from Soviet cookbooks or from restaurant menus, one is embarrassed for our authors and chefs, who popularize the national cuisines of our peoples [that is, the ethnic groups of the Soviet Union] with such ignorance."

According to Meek, Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead, yet Borshchland lives on. Recipes, like birds, ignore political boundaries. ... The faint outline of the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> to the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a> and, in emigration, from <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>.

"Lavanify" is most closely related to the Indian "<a href="Bharattherium">Bharattherium</a>"; the South American "<a href="Sudamerica">Sudamerica</a>" and "<a href="Gondwanatherium">Gondwanatherium</a>" are more distantly related. Gondwanatheres probably ate hard plant material.

"Lavanify" had high-<a href="crown%20%28tooth%29">crowned</a>, curved teeth. One of the two teeth is 11.2 mm high and shows a deep furrow and, is centered laterally in the crown, a V-shaped area that consists of <a href="dentine">dentine</a>. The other, damaged, tooth is 9.8 mm high and has at least one deep cavity (infundibulum). Characters shared by the teeth of "Lavanify" and "Bharattherium" include the presence of an infundibulum and a furrow; they both also have large, continuous bands of matrix (unbundled <a href="hydroxyapatite">hydroxyapatite</a> crystals) between the prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) of the <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>, and <a href="perikymata">perikymata</a>—wave-like ridges and grooves in the enamel surface.

Two teeth of "Lavanify" were discovered in 1995–1996 during joint expeditions of the <a href="State%20University%20of%20New%20York">State University of New York</a>, <a href="Stony%20Brook%20University">Stony Brook University</a>, and the <a href="University%20of%20Antananarivo">University of Antananarivo</a> to the <a href="late%20Cretaceous">late Cretaceous</a> (mostly <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a>, about 71 to 66 million years ago [mya]) <a href="Maevarano%20Formation">Maevarano Formation</a> of northwestern Madagascar. The two teeth were found in different sites in a white <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> unit of the Maevarano Formation near the village of <a href="Berivotra">Berivotra</a> and have been deposited in the collections of the University of Antananarivo (specimen UA 8653) and <a href="Field%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Field Museum of Natural History</a> (specimen FMNH PM 59520). <a href="David%20W.%20Krause">David W. Krause</a> and colleagues described "Lavanify" and a <a href="sudamericidae">sudamericid</a> from India, which they did not name, in a 1997 paper in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>". These were the first <a href="gondwanathere">gondwanathere</a> mammals to be found outside of Argentina and provided evidence that the mammal faunas of the different <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>n (southern) continents were similar to each other. The <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a>, "Lavanify", means "long tooth" and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "miolaka", means "curved" in <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy</a>; both refer to the teeth's shape.

Gondwanatheres are a small group of mammals of uncertain <a href="phylogeny">phylogenetic</a> affinities known from the late Cretaceous to the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> (~56–34 mya) of the Gondwanan continents, known only from teeth and a few lower jaws. Upon their discovery in the 1980s, gondwanatheres were initially thought to be <a href="xenarthra">xenarthra</a>ns—part of the same group as living <a href="sloth">sloth</a>s, <a href="armadillo">armadillo</a>s, and <a href="anteater">anteater</a>s—but later workers have favored affinities with <a href="multituberculate">multituberculate</a>s (a diverse group of fossil mammals) or left the relationships of the gondwanatheres open. The group comprises two <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a>. The family <a href="Ferugliotheriidae">Ferugliotheriidae</a>, whose members had low-crowned teeth, occurs in the <a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> (~84–71 mya) to Maastrichtian of Argentina. All other gondwanatheres, including "Lavanify", are placed in the Sudamericidae, which have high-crowned (<a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a>) teeth. These include "<a href="Gondwanatherium">Gondwanatherium</a>" from the Campanian and Maastrichtian of Argentina; "<a href="Sudamerica">Sudamerica</a>" from the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> (~66–56 mya) of Argentina; "Lavanify"; at least one species from the Maastrichtian of India; an unnamed species related to "Sudamerica" from the Eocene of Antarctica; and an unnamed possible gondwanathere, <a href="TNM%2002067">TNM 02067</a>, from the Cretaceous of Tanzania. In 2007, teams led by G.P. Wilson and G.V.R. Prasad independently described this animal as "Dakshina" and "<a href="Bharattherium">Bharattherium</a>" respectively; as the latter name was published first, it is the correct name for this genus according to the <a href="Principle%20of%20Priority">Principle of Priority</a>. Gondwanatheres have been interpreted as feeding on roots, bark, and abrasive vegetation or as the earliest <a href="grass">grass</a>-eating mammals.

Several other mammals have been recorded from the late Cretaceous of Madagascar, mostly on the basis of isolated teeth. A possible second gondwanathere is represented by a tooth that is larger and lower-crowned than those of "Lavanify", and a yet lower-crowned tooth may also be of a gondwanathere. A lower <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a>, <a href="UA%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B8699">UA 8699</a>, may be of a <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a> or a <a href="placental">placental</a> and a molar fragment is referable to <a href="Multituberculata">Multituberculata</a>. Finally, an as-yet-undescribed mammal is known from a fairly complete skeleton. None of these mammals is related to the living mammals of the island, many of which belong to unique groups (see <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20Madagascar">List of mammals of Madagascar</a>). The fauna also contains <a href="crocodyliform">crocodyliform</a>s, <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s, and other animals.

"Lavanify" is known from the complete cheektooth UA 8653 and the broken tooth FMNH PM 59520. Krause and colleagues could not determine whether the teeth were from the lower or upper jaw and whether they were molars or molariform (molar-like) <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s, but suggested that they represented two different tooth positions. However, Wilson and colleagues in 2007 tentatively identified UA 8653 as a left fourth (last) lower molariform (mf4); because molars and premolars of gondwanatheres cannot be reliably distinguished, the term "molariform" is used instead. FMNH PM 59520 resembles the "Gondwanatherium" fossil MACN Pv-RN 1027, a broken tooth that may be an upper molariform. In both "Lavanify" teeth, the enamel surface features <a href="perikymata">perikymata</a> (ridges and grooves arranged in a transverse, wave-like pattern).

UA 8653, the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>, is hypsodont and curved. It is 11.2 mm high, of which the crown makes up about 85%, and the dimensions of its crown are 3.4 x 3.2 mm. The <a href="Occlusion%20%28dentistry%29">occlusal</a> (chewing) surface is worn flat and contains a V-shaped island of <a href="dentine">dentine</a> surrounded by <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>. One side of the crown lacks enamel. Between the two arms of the V, at the lingual (inner) side of the tooth, is a furrow filled with <a href="cementum">cementum</a>, which extends all the way through the tooth; the presence of such a long furrow distinguishes it from "Gondwanatherium". The enamel is made up of small, round prisms (bundles of <a href="hydroxyapatite">hydroxyapatite</a> crystals) that are separated by large, continuous bands of <a href="interprismatic%20matrix">interprismatic matrix</a> (IPM; the material between the enamel prisms).

FMNH PM 59520 is 9.8 mm high. It is similar in many respects to UA 8653, but is less curved and its occlusal surface contains a large <a href="wikt%3Ainfundibulum">infundibulum</a> (funnel-shaped cavity), filled with cementum and surrounded by enamel that penetrates deeply into the tooth. There is also either a second infundibulum or a cementum-filled furrow. The differences in degree of curvature and occlusal morphology suggest that this tooth represents a different tooth position than UA 8653. Krause and colleagues tentatively placed this tooth in "Lavanify" in view of the considerable variation among other gondwanathere teeth of a single species and in the absence of evidence to the contrary.

In their original description, Krause and colleagues suggested that "Lavanify" was most closely related to the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared presence of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of "Dakshina", Wilson and colleagues added the presence of an infundibulum and of perikymata to the evidence for the relationship between the two. These three characters are <a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphies</a> (shared derived traits) for the "Bharattherium-Lavanify" <a href="clade">clade</a>. They also share the presence of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but whether this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two <a href="autapomorphy">autapomorphies</a> (unique derived traits) of "Lavanify": presence of a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel on one side of the crown. Prasad and colleagues who named "Bharattherium", noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a "Bharattherium" tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of "Bharattherium" and "Lavanify". They also mentioned the presence of a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.

SS Edmund Fitzgerald

SS "Edmund Fitzgerald" was an American <a href="lake%20freighter">Great Lakes freighter</a> that sank in a <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a> storm on November 10, 1975, with the loss of the entire crew of 29. When launched on June 7, 1958, she was the largest ship on North America's <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>, and she remains the largest to have sunk there.

For 17 years, "Edmund Fitzgerald" carried <a href="taconite">taconite</a> <a href="iron">iron ore</a> from mines near <a href="Duluth%2C%20Minnesota">Duluth, Minnesota</a>, to iron works in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo</a>, and other Great Lakes ports. As a workhorse, she set seasonal haul records six times, often breaking her own previous record. Captain Peter Pulcer was known for piping music day or night over the ship's intercom while passing through the <a href="St.%20Clair%20River">St. Clair</a> and <a href="Detroit%20River">Detroit</a> Rivers (between Lakes <a href="Lake%20Huron">Huron</a> and <a href="Lake%20Erie">Erie</a>), and entertaining spectators at the <a href="Soo%20Locks">Soo Locks</a> (between Lakes Superior and Huron) with a running commentary about the ship. Her size, record-breaking performance, and "<a href="Disc%20jockey">DJ</a> captain" endeared "Edmund Fitzgerald" to boat watchers.

Carrying a full cargo of ore pellets with Captain <a href="Ernest%20M.%20McSorley">Ernest M. McSorley</a> in command, she embarked on her ill-fated voyage from <a href="Superior%2C%20Wisconsin">Superior, Wisconsin</a>, near Duluth, on the afternoon of November 9, 1975. En route to a steel mill near Detroit, "Edmund Fitzgerald" joined a second freighter, . By the next day, the two ships were caught in a <a href="List%20of%20storms%20on%20the%20Great%20Lakes%23Wreck%20of%20the%20Edmund%20Fitzgerald%20%281975%29">severe storm</a> on Lake Superior, with near <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">hurricane-force</a> winds and waves up to high. Shortly after 7:10 p.m., "Edmund Fitzgerald" suddenly sank in Canadian (Ontario) waters deep, about from <a href="Whitefish%20Bay">Whitefish Bay</a> near the twin cities of <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan</a>, and <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Ontario">Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario</a>—a distance "Edmund Fitzgerald" could have covered in just over an hour at her top speed. Although "Edmund Fitzgerald" had reported being in difficulty earlier, no distress signals were sent before she sank; Captain McSorley's last message to "Arthur M. Anderson" said, "We are holding our own." Her crew of 29 perished, and no bodies were recovered. The exact cause of the sinking remains unknown, though many books, studies, and expeditions have examined it. "Edmund Fitzgerald" may have been swamped, suffered structural failure or topside damage, been <a href="shoal">shoal</a>ed, or suffered from a combination of these.

The disaster is one of the best-known in the history of Great Lakes shipping. <a href="Gordon%20Lightfoot">Gordon Lightfoot</a> made it the subject of his 1976 hit song <a href="The%20Wreck%20of%20the%20Edmund%20Fitzgerald">"The Wreck of the "Edmund Fitzgerald""</a> after reading an article, "The Cruelest Month", in the November 24, 1975, issue of "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>". The sinking led to changes in Great Lakes shipping regulations and practices that included mandatory survival suits, depth finders, positioning systems, increased <a href="Freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a>, and more frequent inspection of vessels.

<a href="Northwestern%20Mutual%20Financial%20Network">Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company</a> of <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, Wisconsin, invested in the iron and minerals industries on a large-scale basis, including the construction of "Edmund Fitzgerald", which represented the first such investment by any American life insurance company. In 1957, they contracted <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Engineering%20Works">Great Lakes Engineering Works</a> (GLEW), of <a href="River%20Rouge%2C%20Michigan">River Rouge, Michigan</a>, to design and construct the ship "within a foot of the maximum length allowed for passage through the soon-to-be completed <a href="Saint%20Lawrence%20Seaway">Saint Lawrence Seaway</a>." The ship's value at that time was $7 million (equivalent to $ in ). "Edmund Fitzgerald" was the first <a href="Lake%20freighter">laker</a> built to the <a href="seawaymax">maximum St. Lawrence Seaway size</a>, which was long, wide, and with a draft. The <a href="Moulded%20depth">moulded</a> depth (roughly speaking, the vertical height of the hull) was . The hold depth (the inside height of the cargo hold) was . GLEW laid the first <a href="keel">keel</a> plate on August 7 the same year.

With a <a href="deadweight%20tonnage">deadweight capacity</a> of , and a hull, "Edmund Fitzgerald" was the longest ship on the Great Lakes, earning her the title <a href="Queen%20of%20the%20Lakes">Queen of the Lakes</a> until September 17, 1959, when the SS "Murray Bay" was launched. "Edmund Fitzgerald"s three central cargo holds were loaded through 21 watertight hatches, each of steel. Originally coal-fired, her boilers were converted to burn <a href="Residual%20fuel">oil</a> during the 1971–72 winter layup. In 1969, the ship's maneuverability was improved by the installation of a diesel-powered <a href="bow%20thruster">bow thruster</a>.

By ore freighter standards, the interior of "Edmund Fitzgerald" was luxurious. Her <a href="Hudson%27s">J.L. Hudson Company</a>-designed furnishings included deep pile carpeting, tiled bathrooms, drapes over the <a href="porthole">porthole</a>s, and leather swivel chairs in the guest lounge. There were two guest state rooms for passengers. Air conditioning extended to the crew quarters, which featured more amenities than usual. A large <a href="galley%20%28kitchen%29">galley</a> and fully stocked pantry supplied meals for two dining rooms. "Edmund Fitzgerald"s <a href="pilothouse">pilothouse</a> was outfitted with "state-of-the-art nautical equipment and a beautiful map room."

Northwestern Mutual named the ship after its president and chairman of the board, Edmund Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald's own grandfather had himself been a lake captain, and his father owned the Milwaukee Drydock Company that built and repaired ships. More than 15,000 people attended "Edmund Fitzgerald"s <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">christening and launch</a> ceremony on June 7, 1958. But the event was plagued by misfortunes: When Elizabeth Fitzgerald, wife of Edmund Fitzgerald, tried to christen the ship by smashing a champagne bottle over the bow, it took her three attempts to break it. A delay of 36 minutes followed while the shipyard crew struggled to release the keel blocks. Upon sideways launch, the ship created a large wave that "doused" the spectators and then crashed into a pier before righting herself. One man watching the launching had a heart attack and later died. Other witnesses later said they swore the ship was "trying to climb right out of the water". On September 22, 1958, "Edmund Fitzgerald" completed nine days of <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s.

Northwestern Mutual's normal practice was to purchase ships for operation by other companies. In "Edmund Fitzgerald"s case, they signed a 25-year contract with Oglebay Norton Corporation to operate the vessel. Oglebay Norton immediately designated "Edmund Fitzgerald" the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of its Columbia Transportation fleet.

"Edmund Fitzgerald" was a record-setting workhorse, often beating her own milestones. The vessel's record load for a single trip was in 1969. For 17 years, "Edmund Fitzgerald" carried <a href="taconite">taconite</a> from <a href="Iron%20Range">Minnesota's Iron Range</a> mines near Duluth, Minnesota, to iron works in Detroit, Toledo, and other ports. She set seasonal haul records six different times. Her nicknames included "Fitz", "Pride of the American Side", "Mighty Fitz", "Toledo Express", "Big Fitz", and the ""Titanic" of the Great Lakes". Loading "Edmund Fitzgerald" with taconite pellets took about four and a half hours, while unloading took around 14 hours. A round trip between <a href="Superior%2C%20Wisconsin">Superior, Wisconsin</a>, and Detroit, Michigan, usually took her five days and she averaged 47 similar trips per season. The vessel's usual route was between Superior, Wisconsin, and Toledo, Ohio, although her port of destination could vary. By November 1975, "Edmund Fitzgerald" had logged an estimated 748 round trips on the Great Lakes and covered more than a million miles, "a distance roughly equivalent to 44 trips around the world."

Up until a few weeks before her loss, passengers had traveled on board as company guests. Frederick Stonehouse wrote:

Because of her size, appearance, string of records, and "DJ captain," "Edmund Fitzgerald" became a favorite of boat watchers throughout her career. Although Captain Peter Pulcer was in command of "Edmund Fitzgerald" on trips when cargo records were set, "he is best remembered ... for piping music day or night over the ship's intercom system" while passing through the <a href="St.%20Clair%20River">St. Clair</a> and <a href="Detroit%20River">Detroit River</a>s. While navigating the <a href="Soo%20Locks">Soo Locks</a> he would often come out of the pilothouse and use a bullhorn to entertain tourists with a commentary on details about "Edmund Fitzgerald".

In 1969, "Edmund Fitzgerald" received a safety award for eight years of operation without a time-off worker injury. The vessel ran aground in 1969, and she collided with SS "Hochelaga" in 1970. Later that same year, she struck the wall of a <a href="Lock%20%28water%20transport%29">lock</a>, an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974. During 1974, she lost her original bow anchor in the Detroit River. None of these mishaps, however, were considered serious or unusual. <a href="Lake%20freighter">Freshwater ships</a> were built to last more than half a century, and "Edmund Fitzgerald" should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank.

"Edmund Fitzgerald" left Superior, Wisconsin, at 2:15 p.m. on the afternoon of November 9, 1975, under the command of Captain <a href="Ernest%20M.%20McSorley">Ernest M. McSorley</a>. She was en route to the steel mill on <a href="Zug%20Island">Zug Island</a>, near Detroit, Michigan, with a cargo of of taconite ore pellets and soon reached her full speed of . Around 5 p.m., "Edmund Fitzgerald" joined a second freighter under the command of Captain Jesse B. "Bernie" Cooper, , destined for <a href="Gary%2C%20Indiana">Gary, Indiana</a>, out of <a href="Two%20Harbors%2C%20Minnesota">Two Harbors, Minnesota</a>. The weather forecast was not unusual for November and the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> (NWS) predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior by 7 a.m. on November 10.

SS "Wilfred Sykes" loaded opposite "Edmund Fitzgerald" at the Burlington Northern Dock #1 and departed at 4:15 p.m., about two hours after "Edmund Fitzgerald". In contrast to the NWS forecast, Captain Dudley J. Paquette of "Wilfred Sykes" predicted that a major storm would directly cross Lake Superior. From the outset, he chose a route that took advantage of the protection offered by the lake's north shore in order to avoid the worst effects of the storm. The crew of "Wilfred Sykes" followed the radio conversations between "Edmund Fitzgerald" and "Arthur M. Anderson" during the first part of their trip and overheard their captains deciding to take the regular Lake Carriers' Association <a href="downbound">downbound</a> route. The NWS altered its forecast at 7:00 p.m., issuing <a href="gale%20warning">gale warning</a>s for the whole of Lake Superior. "Arthur M. Anderson" and "Edmund Fitzgerald" altered course northward seeking shelter along the Ontario coast where they encountered a winter storm at 1:00 a.m. on November 10. "Edmund Fitzgerald" reported winds of and waves high. Captain Paquette of "Wilfred Sykes" reported that after 1 a.m., he overheard McSorley say that he had reduced the ship's speed because of the rough conditions. Paquette said he was stunned to later hear McSorley, who was not known for turning aside or slowing down, state that "we're going to try for some <a href="Windward%20and%20leeward">lee</a> from <a href="Isle%20Royale">Isle Royale</a>. You're walking away from us anyway ... I can't stay with you."

At 2:00 a.m. on November 10, the NWS upgraded its warnings from gale to storm, forecasting winds of . Until then, "Edmund Fitzgerald" had followed "Arthur M. Anderson," which was travelling at a constant , but the faster "Edmund Fitzgerald" pulled ahead at about 3:00 a.m. As the storm center passed over the ships, they experienced shifting winds, with wind speeds temporarily dropping as wind direction changed from northeast to south and then northwest. After 1:50 p.m., when "Arthur M. Anderson" logged winds of , wind speeds again picked up rapidly and it began to snow at 2:45 p.m., reducing visibility; "Arthur M. Anderson" lost sight of "Edmund Fitzgerald", which was about ahead at the time.

Shortly after 3:30 p.m., Captain McSorley radioed "Arthur M. Anderson" to report that "Edmund Fitzgerald" was taking on water and had lost two vent covers and a fence railing. The vessel had also developed a <a href="List%20%28watercraft%29">list</a>. Two of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s six <a href="bilge%20pump">bilge pump</a>s ran continuously to discharge shipped water. McSorley said that he would slow his ship down so that "Arthur M. Anderson" could close the gap between them. In a broadcast shortly afterward, the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> (USCG) warned all shipping that the <a href="Soo%20Locks">Soo Locks</a> had been closed and they should seek safe anchorage. Shortly after 4:10 p.m., McSorley called "Arthur M. Anderson" again to report a radar failure and asked "Arthur M. Anderson" to keep track of them. "Edmund Fitzgerald", effectively blind, slowed to let "Arthur M. Anderson" come within a range so she could receive radar guidance from the other ship.

For a time, "Arthur M. Anderson" directed "Edmund Fitzgerald" toward the relative safety of <a href="Whitefish%20Bay">Whitefish Bay</a>; then, at 4:39 p.m., McSorley contacted the USCG station in <a href="Grand%20Marais%2C%20Michigan">Grand Marais, Michigan</a>, to inquire whether the <a href="Whitefish%20Point%20Light">Whitefish Point light</a> and navigation <a href="Electric%20beacon">beacon</a> were operational. The USCG replied that their monitoring equipment indicated that both instruments were inactive. McSorley then hailed any ships in the Whitefish Point area to report the state of the navigational aids, receiving an answer from Captain Cedric Woodard of "Avafors" between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. that the Whitefish Point light was on but not the radio beacon. Woodard testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say, "Don't allow nobody on deck," as well as something about a vent that Woodard could not understand. Some time later, McSorley told Woodard, "I have a 'bad list', I have lost both radars, and am taking heavy seas over the deck in one of the worst seas I have ever been in."

By late in the afternoon of November 10, sustained winds of over were recorded by ships and observation points across eastern Lake Superior. "Arthur M. Anderson" logged sustained winds as high as at 4:52 p.m., while waves increased to as high as by 6:00 p.m. "Arthur M. Anderson" was also struck by gusts and <a href="rogue%20wave">rogue wave</a>s as high as .

The last communication from the ship came at approximately 7:10 p.m., when "Arthur M. Anderson" notified "Edmund Fitzgerald" of an <a href="downbound">upbound</a> ship and asked how she was doing. McSorley reported, "We are holding our own." She sank minutes later. No distress signal was received, and ten minutes later, "Arthur M. Anderson" lost the ability either to raise "Edmund Fitzgerald" by radio or to detect her on radar.

Captain Cooper of "Arthur M. Anderson" first called the USCG in <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a> at 7:39 p.m. on channel 16, the radio distress frequency. The USCG responders instructed him to call back on channel 12 because they wanted to keep their emergency channel open and they were having difficulty with their communication systems, including antennas blown down by the storm. Cooper then contacted the upbound saltwater vessel "Nanfri" and was told that she could not pick up "Edmund Fitzgerald" on her radar either. Despite repeated attempts to raise the USCG, Cooper was not successful until 7:54 p.m. when the officer on duty asked him to keep watch for a boat lost in the area. At about 8:25 p.m., Cooper again called the USCG to express his concern about "Edmund Fitzgerald" and at 9:03 p.m. reported her missing. Petty Officer Philip Branch later testified, "I considered it serious, but at the time it was not urgent."

Lacking appropriate search-and-rescue vessels to respond to "Edmund Fitzgerald"s disaster, at approximately 9:00 p.m., the USCG asked "Arthur M. Anderson" to turn around and look for survivors. Around 10:30 p.m., the USCG asked all commercial vessels anchored in or near Whitefish Bay to assist in the search. The initial search for survivors was carried out by "Arthur M. Anderson", and a second freighter, . The efforts of a third freighter, the <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>-registered , were foiled by the weather. The USCG sent a <a href="buoy%20tender">buoy tender</a>, , from Duluth, Minnesota, but it would take two and a half hours to launch and a day to travel to the search area. The <a href="Traverse%20City%2C%20Michigan">Traverse City, Michigan</a>, USCG station launched an <a href="Grumman%20HU-16%20Albatross">HU-16</a> fixed-wing search aircraft that arrived on the scene at 10:53 p.m. while an <a href="Sikorsky%20S-62">HH-52</a> USCG helicopter with a 3.8-million-<a href="candlepower">candlepower</a> searchlight arrived at 1:00 a.m. on November 11. <a href="Canadian%20Coast%20Guard">Canadian Coast Guard</a> aircraft joined the three-day search and the <a href="Ontario%20Provincial%20Police">Ontario Provincial Police</a> established and maintained a beach patrol all along the eastern shore of Lake Superior.

Although the search recovered debris, including lifeboats and rafts, none of the crew were found. On her final voyage, "Edmund Fitzgerald"s crew of 29 consisted of the <a href="Captain%20%28nautical%29">captain</a>, the <a href="First%20mate">first</a>, <a href="Second%20mate">second</a> and <a href="third%20mate">third mate</a>s, five <a href="Seafarer%27s%20professions%20and%20ranks">engineers</a>, three <a href="Oiler%20%28occupation%29">oilers</a>, a cook, a <a href="Wiper%20%28occupation%29">wiper</a>, two maintenance men, three watchmen, three <a href="deckhand">deckhand</a>s, three <a href="wheelsmen">wheelsmen</a>, two porters, a cadet and a <a href="Chief%20steward">steward</a>. Most of the crew was from Ohio and Wisconsin; their ages ranged from 20-year-old watchman Karl A. Peckol to Captain McSorley, 63 years old and planning his retirement.

"Edmund Fitzgerald" is among the largest and best-known vessels lost on the Great Lakes but she is not alone on the Lake Superior seabed in that area. In the years between 1816, when "Invincible" was lost, and 1975, when "Edmund Fitzgerald" sank, the <a href="Whitefish%20Point%20Underwater%20Preserve">Whitefish Point</a> area had claimed at least 240 ships.

A U.S. Navy <a href="Lockheed%20P-3%20Orion">Lockheed P-3 Orion</a> aircraft, piloted by Lt. George Conner and equipped to detect <a href="magnetic%20anomalies">magnetic anomalies</a> usually associated with submarines, found the wreck on November 14, 1975. "Edmund Fitzgerald" lay about west of Deadman's Cove, Ontario, from the entrance to Whitefish Bay to the southeast, in Canadian waters close to the international boundary at a depth of . A further November 14–16 survey by the USCG using a <a href="side%20scan%20sonar">side scan sonar</a> revealed two large objects lying close together on the lake floor. The U.S. Navy also contracted Seaward, Inc., to conduct a second survey between November 22 and 25.

From May 20 to 28, 1976, the U.S. Navy dived the wreck using its unmanned <a href="submersible">submersible</a>, <a href="CURV-III">CURV-III</a>, and found "Edmund Fitzgerald" lying in two large pieces in of water. Navy estimates put the length of the bow section at and that of the stern section at . The bow section stood upright in the mud, some from the stern section that lay capsized at a 50-degree angle from the bow. In between the two broken sections lay a large mass of taconite pellets and scattered wreckage lying about, including hatch covers and hull plating.

In 1980, during a Lake Superior research dive expedition, marine explorer <a href="Jean-Michel%20Cousteau">Jean-Michel Cousteau</a>, the son of <a href="Jacques%20Cousteau">Jacques Cousteau</a>, sent two divers from in the first manned submersible dive to "Edmund Fitzgerald". The dive was brief, and although the dive team drew no final conclusions, they speculated that "Edmund Fitzgerald" had broken up on the surface.

The <a href="National%20Sea%20Grant%20Program">Michigan Sea Grant Program</a> organized a three-day dive to survey "Edmund Fitzgerald" in 1989. The primary objective was to record 3-D videotape for use in museum educational programs and production of documentaries. The expedition used a towed survey system (TSS Mk1) and a self-propelled, tethered, free swimming <a href="remotely%20operated%20underwater%20vehicle">remotely operated underwater vehicle</a> (ROV). The Mini Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and wide angle lenses in order to produce 3-D images. The towed survey system and the Mini Rover ROV were designed, built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International, Inc. Participants included the <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA), the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a>, the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Shipwreck%20Museum">Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society</a> (GLSHS), and the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a>, the latter providing RV "Grayling" as the support vessel for the ROV. The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the "Edmund Fitzgerald" wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions about the cause of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s sinking.

Canadian explorer <a href="Joseph%20B.%20MacInnis">Joseph B. MacInnis</a> organized and led six publicly funded dives to "Edmund Fitzgerald" over a three-day period in 1994. <a href="Harbor%20Branch%20Oceanographic%20Institution">Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution</a> provided "Edwin A. Link" as the support vessel, and their manned submersible, "Celia." The GLSHS paid $10,000 for three of its members to each join a dive and take still pictures. MacInnis concluded that the notes and video obtained during the dives did not provide an explanation why "Edmund Fitzgerald" sank. The same year, longtime sport diver Fred Shannon formed Deepquest Ltd., and organized a privately funded dive to the wreck of "Edmund Fitzgerald", using Delta Oceanographic's submersible, "Delta." Deepquest Ltd. conducted seven dives and took more than 42 hours of underwater video while Shannon set the record for the longest submersible dive to "Edmund Fitzgerald" at 211 minutes. Prior to conducting the dives, Shannon studied NOAA navigational charts and found that the international boundary had changed three times before its publication by NOAA in 1976. Shannon determined that based on GPS coordinates from the 1994 Deepquest expedition, "at least one-third of the two acres of immediate wreckage containing the two major portions of the vessel is in U.S. waters because of an error in the position of the U.S.–Canada boundary line shown on official lake charts."

Shannon's group discovered the remains of a crew member partly dressed in coveralls and wearing a life jacket lying face up on the lake bottom alongside the bow of the ship, indicating that at least one of the crew was aware of the possibility of sinking. The life jacket had deteriorated canvas and "what is thought to be six rectangular cork blocks ... clearly visible." Shannon concluded that "massive and advancing structural failure" caused "Edmund Fitzgerald" to break apart on the surface and sink.

MacInnis led another series of dives in 1995 to salvage the bell from "Edmund Fitzgerald". The <a href="Sault%20Tribe%20of%20Chippewa%20Indians">Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians</a> backed the expedition by co-signing a loan in the amount of $250,000. Canadian engineer <a href="Phil%20Nuytten">Phil Nuytten</a>'s <a href="atmospheric%20diving%20suit">atmospheric diving suit</a>, known as the "<a href="Newtsuit">Newtsuit</a>," was used to retrieve the bell from the ship, replace it with a replica, and put a beer can in "Edmund Fitzgerald"s pilothouse. That same year, Terrence Tysall and Mike Zee set multiple records when they used <a href="Trimix%20%28breathing%20gas%29">trimix gas</a> to scuba dive to "Edmund Fitzgerald". The pair are the only people known to have touched the "Edmund Fitzgerald" wreck. They also set records for the deepest scuba dive on the Great Lakes and the deepest shipwreck dive, and were the first divers to reach "Edmund Fitzgerald" without the aid of a submersible. It took six minutes to reach the wreck, six minutes to survey it, and three hours to resurface to avoid <a href="decompression%20sickness">decompression sickness</a>, also known as "the bends."

Under the "<a href="Ontario%20Heritage%20Act">Ontario Heritage Act</a>", activities on registered archeological sites require a license. In March 2005, the Whitefish Point Preservation Society accused the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) of conducting an unauthorized dive to "Edmund Fitzgerald". Although the director of the GLSHS admitted to conducting a sonar scan of the wreck in 2002, he denied such a survey required a license at the time it was carried out.

An April 2005 amendment to the "Ontario Heritage Act" allows the Ontario government to impose a license requirement on dives, the operation of submersibles, side scan sonars or underwater cameras within a designated radius around protected sites. Conducting any of those activities without a license would result in fine of up to . On the basis of the amended law, to protect wreck sites considered "watery graves", the Ontario government issued updated regulations in January 2006, including an area with a radius around "Edmund Fitzgerald" and other specifically designated marine archeological sites. In 2009, a further amendment to the "Ontario Heritage Act" imposed licensing requirements on any type of surveying device.

Extreme weather and sea conditions play a role in all of the published theories regarding "Edmund Fitzgerald"s sinking, but they differ on the other causal factors.

In 2005 NOAA and the NWS ran a computer simulation, including weather and wave conditions, covering the period from November 9, 1975, until the early morning of November 11. Analysis of the simulation showed that two separate areas of high wind appeared over Lake Superior at 4:00 p.m. on November 10. One had speeds in excess of and the other winds in excess of . The southeastern part of the lake, the direction in which "Edmund Fitzgerald" was heading, had the highest winds. Average wave heights increased to near by 7:00 p.m., November 10, and winds exceeded over most of southeastern Lake Superior.

"Edmund Fitzgerald" sank at the eastern edge of the area of high wind where the long <a href="Fetch%20%28geography%29">fetch</a>, or distance that wind blows over water, produced significant waves averaging over by 7:00 p.m. and over at 8:00 p.m. The simulation also showed one in 100 waves reaching and one out of every 1,000 reaching . Since the ship was heading east-southeastward, the waves likely caused "Edmund Fitzgerald" to roll heavily.

At the time of the sinking, the ship "Arthur M. Anderson" reported northwest winds of , matching the simulation analysis result of . The analysis further showed that the maximum sustained winds reached near <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">hurricane force</a> of about with gusts to at the time and location where "Edmund Fitzgerald" sank.

A group of three <a href="rogue%20wave%20%28oceanography%29">rogue waves</a>, often called "three sisters," was reported in the vicinity of "Edmund Fitzgerald" at the time she sank. The "three sisters" phenomenon is said to occur on Lake Superior as a result of a sequence of three rogue waves forming that are one-third larger than normal waves. When the first wave hits a ship's deck, before its water drains away the second wave strikes. The third incoming wave adds to the two accumulated backwashes, suddenly overloading the deck with tons of water.

Captain Cooper of "Arthur M. Anderson" reported that his ship was "hit by two 30 to 35 foot seas about 6:30 p.m., one burying the aft cabins and damaging a lifeboat by pushing it right down onto the saddle. The second wave of this size, perhaps 35 foot, came over the bridge deck." Cooper went on to say that these two waves, possibly followed by a third, continued in the direction of "Edmund Fitzgerald" and would have struck about the time she sank. This theory postulates that the "three sisters" compounded the twin problems of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s known list and her lower speed in heavy seas that already allowed water to remain on her deck for longer than usual.

The ""Edmund Fitzgerald"" episode of the 2010 television series "Dive Detectives" features the wave-generating tank of the <a href="National%20Research%20Council%20%28Canada%29">National Research Council</a>'s Institute for Naval Technology in <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's</a>, and the tank's simulation of the effect of a rogue wave upon a scale model of "Edmund Fitzgerald". The simulation indicated such a rogue wave could almost completely submerge the bow or stern of the ship with water, at least temporarily.

The July 26, 1977, USCG Marine Casualty Report suggested that the accident was caused by ineffective hatch closures. The report concluded that these devices failed to prevent waves from inundating the cargo hold. The flooding occurred gradually and probably imperceptibly throughout the final day, finally resulting in a fatal loss of buoyancy and stability. As a result, "Edmund Fitzgerald" plummeted to the bottom without warning. Video footage of the wreck site showed that most of her hatch clamps were in perfect condition. The USCG Marine board concluded that the few damaged clamps were probably the only ones fastened. As a result, ineffective hatch closure caused "Edmund Fitzgerald" to flood and founder.

From the beginning of the USCG inquiry, some of the crewmen's families and various labor organizations believed the USCG findings could be tainted because there were serious questions regarding their preparedness as well as licensing and rules changes. Paul Trimble, a retired USCG vice admiral and president of the Lake Carriers Association (LCA), wrote a letter to the <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB) on September 16, 1977, that included the following statements of objection to the USCG findings:
It was common practice for ore freighters, even in foul weather, to embark with not all cargo clamps locked in place on the hatch covers. Maritime author Wolff reported that depending on weather conditions, all the clamps were eventually set within one to two days. Captain Paquette of "Wilfred Sykes" was dismissive of suggestions that unlocked hatch clamps caused "Edmund Fitzgerald" to founder. He said that he commonly sailed in fine weather using the minimum number of clamps necessary to secure the hatch covers.

The May 4, 1978, NTSB findings differed from the USCG. The NTSB made the following observations based on the CURV-III survey:

The NTSB conducted computer studies, testing and analysis to determine the forces necessary to collapse the hatch covers and concluded that "Edmund Fitzgerald" sank suddenly from flooding of the cargo hold "due to the collapse of one or more of the hatch covers under the weight of giant boarding seas" instead of flooding gradually due to ineffective hatch closures. The NTSB dissenting opinion held that "Edmund Fitzgerald" sank suddenly and unexpectedly from <a href="wave%20shoaling">shoaling</a>.

The LCA believed that instead of hatch cover leakage, the more probable cause of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s loss was <a href="shoal">shoal</a>ing or grounding in the Six Fathom Shoal northwest of <a href="Caribou%20Island%20%28Lake%20Superior%29">Caribou Island</a> when the vessel "unknowingly raked a <a href="reef">reef</a>" during the time the Whitefish Point light and radio beacon were not available as navigation aids. This theory was supported by a 1976 Canadian hydrographic survey, which disclosed that an unknown shoal ran a mile further east of Six Fathom Shoal than shown on the Canadian charts. Officers from "Arthur M. Anderson" observed that "Edmund Fitzgerald" sailed through this exact area. Conjecture by proponents of the Six Fathom Shoal theory concluded that "Edmund Fitzgerald"s downed fence rail reported by McSorley could occur only if the ship "<a href="Hogging%20and%20sagging">hogged</a>" during shoaling, with the bow and stern bent downward and the midsection raised by the shoal, pulling the railing tight until the cables dislodged or tore under the strain. Divers searched the Six Fathom Shoal after the wreck occurred and found no evidence of "a recent collision or grounding anywhere." Maritime authors Bishop and Stonehouse wrote that the shoaling theory was later challenged on the basis of the higher quality of detail in Shannon's 1994 photography that "explicitly show[s] the devastation of the "Edmund Fitzgerald"". Shannon's photography of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s overturned stern showed "no evidence on the bottom of the stern, the propeller or the rudder of the ship that would indicate the ship struck a shoal."

Maritime author Stonehouse reasoned that "unlike the Lake Carriers, the Coast Guard had no vested interest in the outcome of their investigation." Author Bishop reported that Captain Paquette of "Wilfred Sykes" argued that through their support for the shoaling explanation, the LCA represented the shipping company's interests by advocating a theory that held LCA member companies, the <a href="American%20Bureau%20of%20Shipping">American Bureau of Shipping</a>, and the U.S. Coast Guard Service blameless.

Paul Hainault, a retired professor of mechanical engineering from <a href="Michigan%20Technological%20University">Michigan Technological University</a>, promoted a theory that began as a student class project. His hypothesis held that "Edmund Fitzgerald" grounded at 9:30 a.m. on November 10 on <a href="Superior%20Shoal">Superior Shoal</a>. This shoal, charted in 1929, is an underwater mountain in the middle of Lake Superior about north of <a href="Copper%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Copper Harbor, Michigan</a>. It has sharp peaks that rise nearly to the lake surface with water depths ranging from , making it a menace to navigation. Discovery of the shoal resulted in a change in recommended shipping routes. A <a href="seiche">seiche</a>, or standing wave, that occurred during the low-pressure system over Lake Superior on November 10, 1975, caused the lake to rise over the Soo Locks's gates to flood Portage Avenue in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, with of water. Hainault's theory held that this seiche contributed to "Edmund Fitzgerald" shoaling of her hull on Superior Shoal, causing the hull to be punctured mid-body. The hypothesis contended that the wave action continued to damage the hull, until the middle third dropped out like a box, leaving the ship held together by the center deck. The stern section acted as an anchor and caused "Edmund Fitzgerald" to come to a full stop, causing everything to go forward. The ship broke apart on the surface within seconds. Compressed air pressure blew a hole in the starboard bow, which sank 18 degrees off course. The rear kept going forward with the engine still running, rolled to port and landed bottom up.

Another published theory contends that an already weakened structure, and modification of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s winter <a href="Ship%27s%20load%20line">load line</a> (which allows heavier loading and travel lower in the water), made it possible for large waves to cause a stress fracture in the hull. This is based on the "regular" huge waves of the storm and does not necessarily involve rogue waves.

The USCG and NTSB investigated whether "Edmund Fitzgerald" broke apart due to structural failure of the hull and because the 1976 CURV III survey found "Edmund Fitzgerald"s sections were from each other, the USCG's formal casualty report of July 1977 concluded that she had separated upon hitting the lake floor. The NTSB came to the same conclusion as USCG because:

Other authors have concluded that "Edmund Fitzgerald" most likely broke in two on the surface before sinking due to the intense waves, like the ore carriers and . After maritime historian Frederick Stonehouse moderated the panel reviewing the video footage from the 1989 ROV survey of "Edmund Fitzgerald", he concluded that the extent of taconite coverage over the wreck site showed that the stern had floated on the surface for a short time and spilled taconite into the forward section; thus the two sections of the wreck did not sink at the same time. The 1994 Shannon team found that the stern and the bow were apart, leading Shannon to conclude that "Edmund Fitzgerald" broke up on the surface. He said:

The stress fracture theory was supported by the testimony of former crewmen. Former Second Mate Richard Orgel, who served on "Edmund Fitzgerald" in 1972 and 1973, testified that "the ship had a tendency to bend and spring during storms 'like a diving board after somebody has jumped off. Orgel was quoted as saying that the loss of "Edmund Fitzgerald" was caused by hull failure, "pure and simple. I detected undue stress in the side tunnels by examining the white enamel paint, which will crack and splinter when submitted to severe stress." George H. "Red" Burgner, "Edmund Fitzgerald"s <a href="Chief%20steward">steward</a> for ten seasons and winter ship-keeper for seven years, testified in a deposition that a "loose <a href="keel">keel</a>" contributed to the vessel's loss. Burgner further testified that "the keel and sister <a href="kelson">kelson</a>s were only 'tack welded'" and that he had personally observed that many of the welds were broken. Burgner was not asked to testify before the Marine Board of Inquiry.

When <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel">Bethlehem Steel Corporation</a> permanently laid up "Edmund Fitzgerald"s <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>, SS "Arthur B. Homer", just five years after going to considerable expense to lengthen her, questions were raised as to whether both ships had the same structural problems. The two vessels were built in the same shipyard using welded joints instead of the riveted joints used in older ore freighters. Riveted joints allow a ship to flex and work in heavy seas, while welded joints are more likely to break. Reports indicate that repairs to "Edmund Fitzgerald"s hull were delayed in 1975 due to plans to lengthen the ship during the upcoming winter layup. "Arthur B. Homer" was lengthened to and placed back in service by December 1975, not long after "Edmund Fitzgerald" foundered. In 1978, without explanation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation denied permission for the chairman of the NTSB to travel on "Arthur B. Homer". "Arthur B. Homer" was permanently laid up in 1980 and broken for scrap in 1987.

Retired GLEW naval architect Raymond Ramsay, one of the members of the design team that worked on the hull of "Edmund Fitzgerald", reviewed her increased load lines, maintenance history, along with the history of long ship hull failure and concluded that "Edmund Fitzgerald" was not seaworthy on November 10, 1975. He stated that planning "Edmund Fitzgerald" to be compatible with the constraints of the St. Lawrence Seaway had placed her hull design in a "." "Edmund Fitzgerald"s long-ship design was developed without the benefit of <a href="Research%20and%20development">research, development, test, and evaluation</a> principles while computerized analytical technology was not available at the time she was built. Ramsay noted that "Edmund Fitzgerald"s hull was built with an all-welded (instead of riveted) modular fabrication method, which was used for the first time in the GLEW shipyard. Ramsay concluded that increasing the hull length to resulted in a L/D slenderness ratio (the ratio of the length of the ship to the depth of her structure) that caused excessive multi-axial bending and springing of the hull, and that the hull should have been structurally reinforced to cope with her increased length.

The USCG cited topside damage as a reasonable alternative reason for "Edmund Fitzgerald" sinking and surmised that damage to the fence rail and vents was possibly caused by a heavy floating object such as a log. Historian and mariner Mark Thompson believes that something broke loose from "Edmund Fitzgerald"s deck. He theorized that the loss of the vents resulted in flooding of two ballast tanks or a ballast tank and a walking tunnel that caused the ship to list. Thompson further conjectured that damage more extensive than Captain McSorley could detect in the pilothouse let water flood the cargo hold. He concluded that the topside damage "Edmund Fitzgerald" experienced at 3:30 p.m. on November 10, compounded by the heavy seas, was the most obvious explanation for why she sank.

The USCG, NTSB, and proponents of alternative theories have all named multiple possible contributing factors to the foundering of "Edmund Fitzgerald".

The NWS long range forecast on November 9, 1975, predicted that a storm would pass just south of Lake Superior and over the <a href="Keweenaw%20Peninsula">Keweenaw Peninsula</a>, extending into the Lake from Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Captain Paquette of "Wilfred Sykes" had been following and charting the low pressure system over <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> since November 8 and concluded that a major storm would track across eastern Lake Superior. He therefore chose a route that gave "Wilfred Sykes" the most protection and took refuge in <a href="Thunder%20Bay">Thunder Bay</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, during the worst of the storm. Based on the NWS forecast, "Arthur M. Anderson" and "Edmund Fitzgerald" instead started their trip across Lake Superior following the regular Lake Carriers Association route, which placed them in the path of the storm. The NTSB investigation concluded that the NWS failed to accurately predict wave heights on November 10. After running computer models in 2005 using actual meteorological data from November 10, 1975, Hultquist of the NWS said of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s position in the storm, "It ended in precisely the wrong place at the absolute worst time."

After reviewing testimony that "Edmund Fitzgerald" had passed near shoals north of Caribou Island, the USCG Marine Board examined the relevant navigational charts. They found that the Canadian 1973 navigational chart for the Six Fathom Shoal area was based on Canadian surveys from 1916 and 1919 and that the 1973 U.S. Lake Survey Chart No. 9 included the notation, "Canadian Areas. For data concerning Canadian areas, Canadian authorities have been consulted." Thereafter, at the request of the Marine Board and the Commander of the USCG Ninth District, the <a href="Canadian%20Hydrographic%20Service">Canadian Hydrographic Service</a> conducted a survey of the area surrounding <a href="Michipicoten%20Island">Michipicoten Island</a> and Caribou Island in 1976. The survey revealed that the shoal ran about further east than shown on Canadian charts. The NTSB investigation concluded that, at the time of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s foundering, Lake Survey Chart No. 9 was not detailed enough to indicate Six Fathom Shoal as a hazard to navigation.

Mark Thompson, a <a href="Merchant%20Navy">merchant seaman</a> and author of numerous books on Great Lakes shipping, stated that if her cargo holds had had <a href="watertight%20subdivision">watertight subdivision</a>s, "the "Edmund Fitzgerald" could have made it into Whitefish Bay." Frederick Stonehouse also held that the lack of watertight <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>s caused "Edmund Fitzgerald" to sink. He said:

Stonehouse called on ship designers and builders to design lake carriers more like ships rather than "motorized super-barges" making the following comparison:

After "Edmund Fitzgerald" foundered, Great Lakes shipping companies were accused of valuing cargo <a href="Cargo">payloads</a> more than human life, since the vessel's cargo hold of had been divided by two non-watertight traverse "screen" bulkheads. The NTSB "Edmund Fitzgerald" investigation concluded that Great Lakes freighters should be constructed with watertight bulkheads in their cargo holds.

The USCG had proposed rules for watertight bulkheads in Great Lakes vessels as early as the sinking of "Daniel J. Morrell" in 1966 and did so again after the sinking of "Edmund Fitzgerald", arguing that this would allow ships to make it to refuge or at least allow crew members to abandon ship in an orderly fashion. The LCA represented the Great Lakes fleet owners and was able to forestall watertight subdivision regulations by arguing that this would cause economic hardship for vessel operators. A few vessel operators have built Great Lakes ships with watertight subdivisions in the cargo holds since 1975, but most vessels operating on the lakes cannot prevent flooding of the entire cargo hold area.

A <a href="fathometer">fathometer</a> was not required under USCG regulations, and "Edmund Fitzgerald" lacked one, even though fathometers were available at the time of her sinking. Instead, a <a href="Sounding%20line">hand line</a> was the only method "Edmund Fitzgerald" had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided "Edmund Fitzgerald" additional navigational data and made her less dependent on "Arthur M. Anderson" for navigational assistance.

"Edmund Fitzgerald" had no system to monitor the presence or amount of water in her cargo hold, even though there was always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck (deck over the cargo holds). The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water reached the top of the taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because "Edmund Fitzgerald" lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost <a href="Freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a> (the level of a ship's deck above the water).

The USCG increased "Edmund Fitzgerald"s load line in 1969, 1971, and 1973 to allow less minimum freeboard than "Edmund Fitzgerald"s original design allowed in 1958. This meant that "Edmund Fitzgerald"s deck was only above the water when she faced waves during the November 10 storm. Captain Paquette of "Wilfred Sykes" noted that this change allowed loading to 4,000 tons more than what "Edmund Fitzgerald" was designed to carry.

Concerns regarding "Edmund Fitzgerald"s keel-welding problem surfaced during the time the USCG started increasing her load line. This increase and the resultant reduction in freeboard decreased the vessel's critical reserve buoyancy. Prior to the load-line increases she was said to be a "good riding ship" but afterwards "Edmund Fitzgerald" became a sluggish ship with slower response and recovery times. Captain McSorley said he did not like the action of a ship he described as a "wiggling thing" that scared him. "Edmund Fitzgerald"s bow hooked to one side or the other in heavy seas without recovering and made a groaning sound not heard on other ships.

NTSB investigators noted that "Edmund Fitzgerald"s prior <a href="Ship%20grounding">groundings</a> could have caused undetected damage that led to major structural failure during the storm, since Great Lakes vessels were normally <a href="drydock">drydock</a>ed for inspection only once every five years. It was also alleged that when compared to "Edmund Fitzgerald"s previous captain, McSorley did not keep up with routine maintenance and did not confront the mates about getting the requisite work done. After August B. Herbel, Jr., president of the <a href="ASTM%20International">American Society for Testing and Materials</a>, examined photographs of the welds on "Edmund Fitzgerald", he stated, "the hull was just being held together with patching plates." Other questions were raised as to why the USCG did not discover and take corrective action in its pre-November 1975 inspection of "Edmund Fitzgerald" given that her hatch coamings, gaskets, and clamps were poorly maintained.

On the fateful evening of November 10, 1975, McSorley reported he had never seen bigger seas in his life. Paquette, master of "Wilfred Sykes," out in the same storm, said, "I'll tell anyone that it was a "monster" sea washing solid water over the deck of every vessel out there." The USCG did not broadcast that all ships should seek safe anchorage until after 3:35 p.m. on November 10, many hours after the weather was upgraded from a gale to a storm.

McSorley was known as a "heavy weather captain" who beat hell' out of the "Edmund Fitzgerald" and 'very seldom ever hauled up for weather. Paquette held the opinion that negligence caused "Edmund Fitzgerald" to founder. He said, "in my opinion, all the subsequent events arose because (McSorley) kept pushing that ship and didn't have enough training in weather forecasting to use common sense and pick a route out of the worst of the wind and seas." Paquette's vessel was the first to reach a discharge port after the November 10 storm; she was met by company attorneys who came aboard "Sykes." He told them that "Edmund Fitzgerald"s foundering was caused by negligence. Paquette was never asked to testify during the USCG or NTSB investigations.

The NTSB investigation noted that Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms, and called for the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.

The USCG Marine Board issued the following conclusion:

Mark Thompson countered that "the Coast Guard laid bare [its] own complacency" by blaming the sinking of "Edmund Fitzgerald" on industry-wide complacency since it had inspected "Edmund Fitzgerald" just two weeks before she sank. The loss of "Edmund Fitzgerald" also exposed the USCG's lack of rescue capability on Lake Superior. Thompson said that ongoing budget cuts had limited the USCG's ability to perform its historical functions. He further noted that USCG rescue vessels were unlikely to reach the scene of an incident on Lake Superior or Lake Huron within 6 to 12 hours of its occurrence.

Under <a href="maritime%20law">maritime law</a>, ships fall under the jurisdiction of the <a href="Admiralty%20law">admiralty courts</a> of their flag country. As "Edmund Fitzgerald" was sailing under the U.S. flag, even though she sank in foreign (Canadian) waters, she was subject to U.S. admiralty law. With a value of $24 million, "Edmund Fitzgerald"s financial loss was the greatest in Great Lakes sailing history. In addition to the crew, of taconite sank along with the vessel. Two widows of crewmen filed a $1.5 million lawsuit against "Edmund Fitzgerald"s owners, Northwestern Mutual, and its operators, Oglebay Norton Corporation, one week after she sank. An additional $2.1 million lawsuit was later filed. Oglebay Norton subsequently filed a petition in the U.S. District Court seeking to "limit their liability to $817,920 in connection with other suits filed by families of crew members." The company paid compensation to surviving families about 12 months in advance of official findings of the probable cause and on condition of imposed confidentiality agreements. Robert Hemming, a reporter and newspaper editor, reasoned in his book about "Edmund Fitzgerald" that the USCG's conclusions "were benign in placing blame on [n]either the company or the captain ... [and] saved the Oglebay Norton from very expensive lawsuits by the families of the lost crew."

The USCG investigation of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s sinking resulted in 15 recommendations regarding load lines, weathertight integrity, search and rescue capability, lifesaving equipment, crew training, loading manuals, and providing information to masters of Great Lakes vessels. NTSB's investigation resulted in 19 recommendations for the USCG, four recommendations for the American Bureau of Shipping, and two recommendations for NOAA. Of the official recommendations, the following actions and USCG regulations were put in place:

Karl Bohnak, an Upper Peninsula meteorologist, covered the sinking and storm in a book on local weather history. In this book, Joe Warren, a deckhand on "Arthur M. Anderson" during the November 10, 1975, storm, said that the storm changed the way things were done. He stated, "After that, trust me, when a gale came up we dropped the hook [anchor]. We dropped the hook because they found out the big ones could sink." Mark Thompson wrote, "Since the loss of the "Fitz," some captains may be more prone to go to anchor, rather than venturing out in a severe storm, but there are still too many who like to portray themselves as 'heavy weather sailors.'"

The day after the wreck, <a href="Mariners%27%20Church">Mariners' Church</a> in Detroit rang its bell 29 times; once for each life lost. The church continued to hold an annual memorial, reading the names of the crewmen and ringing the church bell, until 2006 when the church broadened its memorial ceremony to commemorate all lives lost on the Great Lakes.

The <a href="ship%27s%20bell">ship's bell</a> was recovered from the wreck on July 4, 1995. A replica engraved with the names of the 29 sailors who lost their lives replaced the original on the wreck. A legal document signed by 46 relatives of the deceased, officials of the Mariners' Church of Detroit and the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historic Society (GLSHS) "donated the custodian and conservatorship" of the bell to the GLSHS "to be incorporated in a permanent memorial at Whitefish Point, Michigan, to honor the memory of the 29 men of the SS "Edmund Fitzgerald."" The terms of the legal agreement made the GLSHS responsible for maintaining the bell, and forbade it from selling or moving the bell or using it for commercial purposes. It provided for transferring the bell to the Mariners' Church of Detroit if the terms were violated.

An uproar occurred in 1995 when a maintenance worker in <a href="St.%20Ignace">St. Ignace</a>, Michigan, refurbished the bell by stripping the protective coating applied by Michigan State University experts. The controversy continued when the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum tried to use the bell as a touring exhibit in 1996. Relatives of the crew halted this move, objecting that the bell was being used as a "traveling trophy." The bell is now on display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in <a href="Whitefish%20Bay">Whitefish Point</a> near <a href="Paradise%2C%20Michigan">Paradise</a>, Michigan.

An anchor from "Edmund Fitzgerald" lost on an earlier trip was recovered from the Detroit River and is on display at the <a href="Belle%20Isle%20Park%23Dossin%20Great%20Lakes%20Museum">Dossin Great Lakes Museum</a> in Detroit, Michigan. The Dossin Great Lakes Museum also hosts a Lost Mariners Remembrance event each year on the evening of November 10. Artifacts on display in the <a href="Steamship%20Valley%20Camp">Steamship Valley Camp</a> museum in Sault Ste. Marie, include two lifeboats, photos, a movie of "Edmund Fitzgerald" and commemorative models and paintings. Every November 10, the <a href="Split%20Rock%20Lighthouse">Split Rock Lighthouse</a> in <a href="Silver%20Bay%2C%20Minnesota">Silver Bay, Minnesota</a> emits a light in honor of "Edmund Fitzgerald."

On August 8, 2007, along a remote shore of Lake Superior on the Keweenaw Peninsula, a Michigan family discovered a lone life-saving ring that appeared to have come from "Edmund Fitzgerald". It bore markings different from those of rings found at the wreck site, and was thought to be a hoax. Later it was determined that the life ring was not from "Edmund Fitzgerald", but had been lost by the owner, whose father had made it as a personal memorial.

The <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mint">Royal Canadian Mint</a> commemorated "Edmund Fitzgerald" in 2015 with a colored silver collector coin, with a face value of $20.

In 1976, Ontario singer-songwriter <a href="Gordon%20Lightfoot">Gordon Lightfoot</a> wrote, composed, and recorded the song "<a href="The%20Wreck%20of%20the%20Edmund%20Fitzgerald">The Wreck of the "Edmund Fitzgerald"</a>" for his album "<a href="Summertime%20Dream">Summertime Dream</a>." On NPR's "Saturday Morning Edition" on February 14, 2015, Gordon Lightfoot said he was inspired to write the song when he saw the name misspelled "Edmond" in "Newsweek" magazine two weeks after the sinking; Lightfoot said he felt that it dishonored the memory of the 29 who died. Lightfoot's popular ballad made the sinking of "Edmund Fitzgerald" one of the better-known disasters in the history of <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> shipping. The original lyrics of the song show a degree of artistic license compared to the events of the actual sinking: it states the destination as Cleveland instead of Detroit. Also, in light of new evidence about what happened, Lightfoot has modified one line for live performances, the original stanza being: When suppertime came the old cook came on deck,<br>Saying 'Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya.'<br>At 7 p.m. a main hatchway caved in, <br>He said, 'Fellas, it's been good to know ya.' Lightfoot changed the third line to "At 7 p.m. it grew dark, it was then," 

The song has been covered by many performers. The Toronto rock band <a href="Rheostatics">Rheostatics</a> recorded it for their second album, "<a href="Melville%20%28album%29">Melville</a>," and their live album "<a href="Double%20Live%20%28Rheostatics%20album%29">Double Live</a>." <a href="The%20Dandy%20Warhols">The Dandy Warhols</a> also covered the song in their "<a href="The%20Black%20Album/Come%20On%20Feel%20The%20Dandy%20Warhols">The Black Album</a>" in 2004.

In 1986, writer <a href="Steven%20Dietz">Steven Dietz</a> and songwriter/lyricist Eric Peltoniemi wrote the musical "Ten November" in memory of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s sinking. In 2005, the play was re-edited into a concert version called "The Gales of November", which opened on the 30th anniversary of the sinking at the <a href="Fitzgerald%20Theater">Fitzgerald Theater</a> in <a href="St.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">St. Paul, Minnesota</a>. Shelley Russell, a professor of theater at <a href="Northern%20Michigan%20University">Northern Michigan University</a>, wrote a play called "Holdin' Our Own"; the play was performed at the university in 2000.

A piano concerto titled "The" "Edmund Fitzgerald" was composed by American composer Geoffrey Peterson in 2002; it premiered by the <a href="Sault%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Sault Symphony Orchestra</a> in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, in November 2005 as another 30th anniversary commemoration.

The fame of "Edmund Fitzgerald"s image and historical narrative have made it public domain and subject to commercialization. A "cottage industry" has evolved across the Great Lakes region from Two Harbors, Minnesota, to Whitefish Point, the incident's "<a href="ground%20zero">ground zero</a>". Memorabilia on sale include Christmas ornaments, T-shirts, coffee mugs, <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Brewing%20Company%23Year-round">"Edmund Fitzgerald" Porter</a>, videos, and other items commemorating the vessel and its loss.

Plymouth Colony

Plymouth Colony (sometimes New Plymouth) was an English colonial venture in North America from 1620 to 1691 at a location that had previously been surveyed and named by Captain <a href="John%20Smith%20%28explorer%29">John Smith</a>. The settlement served as the capital of the colony and developed as the town of <a href="Plymouth%2C%20Massachusetts">Plymouth, Massachusetts</a>. At its height, Plymouth Colony occupied most of the southeastern portion of <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>.

Plymouth Colony was founded by a group of <a href="Puritans%23Puritans%20and%20Separatists">Puritan Separatists</a> initially known as the <a href="Brownist">Brownist</a> Emigration, who came to be known as the <a href="Pilgrims%20%28Plymouth%20Colony%29">Pilgrims</a>. It was one of the earliest successful colonies to be founded by the English in America, along with <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Virginia">Jamestown</a> and other settlements in <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Virginia</a>, and was the first permanent English settlement in the <a href="New%20England">New England</a> region. The colony was able to establish a treaty with <a href="Wampanoag">Wampanoag</a> Chief <a href="Massasoit">Massasoit</a> which helped to ensure its success; in this, they were aided by <a href="Squanto">Squanto</a>, a member of the <a href="Patuxet">Patuxet</a> tribe. Plymouth played a central role in <a href="King%20Philip%27s%20War">King Philip's War</a> (1675–78), one of several <a href="Indian%20Wars">Indian Wars</a>, but the colony was ultimately merged with the <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> and other territories in 1691 to form the <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a>.

Despite the colony's relatively short existence, Plymouth holds a special role in American history. A significant proportion of the citizens of Plymouth were fleeing religious persecution and searching for a place to worship as they saw fit, rather than being entrepreneurs like many of the settlers of Jamestown in Virginia. The social and legal systems of the colony became closely tied to their religious beliefs, as well as to English custom. Many of the people and events surrounding Plymouth Colony have become part of American folklore, including the American tradition of <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> and the monument of <a href="Plymouth%20Rock">Plymouth Rock</a>.

Plymouth Colony was founded by a group of <a href="Puritans%23Puritans%20and%20Separatists">English Puritans</a> who later came to be known as the "<a href="Pilgrim%20%28Plymouth%20Colony%29">Pilgrims</a>". The core group (roughly 40% of the adults and 56% of the family groupings) were part of a congregation led by <a href="William%20Bradford%20%28Plymouth%20Colony%20governor%29">William Bradford</a>. They began to feel the pressures of religious persecution while still in the English village of <a href="Scrooby">Scrooby</a>, near <a href="East%20Retford">East Retford</a>, Nottinghamshire. In 1607, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop</a> <a href="Tobias%20Matthew">Tobias Matthew</a> raided homes and imprisoned several members of the congregation. The congregation left <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a> in 1609 and emigrated to the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Netherlands</a>, settling first in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> and then in <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a>.

In Leiden, the congregation gained the freedom to worship as they chose, but Dutch society was unfamiliar to them. Scrooby had been an agricultural community, whereas Leiden was a thriving industrial center, and the Separatists found the pace of life difficult. The community remained close-knit, but their children began adopting the <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch language</a> and customs, and some also entered the <a href="Dutch%20Army">Dutch Army</a>. The Puritans also were still not free from the persecutions of the English Crown. English authorities came to Leiden to arrest <a href="William%20Brewster%20%28Mayflower%20passenger%29">William Brewster</a> in 1618, after he published comments highly critical of the King of England and the <a href="Anglican%20Church">Anglican Church</a>. Brewster escaped arrest, but the events spurred the congregation to move farther from England.

The congregation obtained a land patent from the <a href="Plymouth%20Company">Plymouth Company</a> in June 1619. They had declined the opportunity to settle south of Cape Cod in <a href="New%20Netherland">New Netherland</a> because of their desire to avoid the Dutch influence. This land patent allowed them to settle at the mouth of the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>. They sought to finance their venture through the <a href="Company%20of%20Merchant%20Adventurers%20of%20London">Merchant Adventurers</a>, a group of businessmen who principally viewed the colony as a means of making a profit. Upon arriving in America, the Pilgrims began working to repay their debts.

Using the financing secured from the Merchant Adventurers, the Colonists bought provisions and obtained passage on two ships: the "<a href="Mayflower">Mayflower</a>" and the "<a href="Speedwell%20%281577%20ship%29">Speedwell</a>". They had intended to leave early in 1620, but they were delayed several months due to difficulties in dealing with the Merchant Adventurers, including several changes in plans for the voyage and in financing. The congregation and the other colonists finally boarded the "Speedwell" in July 1620 in the Dutch port of <a href="Delfshaven">Delfshaven</a>.

"Speedwell" was re-rigged with larger masts before leaving Holland and setting out to meet "Mayflower" in <a href="Southampton%2C%20England">Southampton, England</a>, around the end of July 1620. The Mayflower was purchased in London. The original captains were Captain Reynolds for "Speedwell" and <a href="Christopher%20Jones%20%28Mayflower%20captain%29">Captain Christopher Jones</a> for "Mayflower". Other passengers joined the group in Southampton, including William Brewster, who had been in hiding for the better part of a year, and a group of people known to the Leiden congregation as "The Strangers." This group was largely made up of people recruited by the Merchant Adventurers to provide practical assistance to the colony and additional hands to work for the colony's ventures. The term was also used for many of the <a href="indentured%20servants">indentured servants</a>.

Among the Strangers were <a href="Myles%20Standish">Myles Standish</a>, who was the colony's military leader; <a href="Christopher%20Martin%20%28Mayflower%20Pilgrim%29">Christopher Martin</a>, who had been designated by the Merchant Adventurers to act as shipboard governor during the trans-Atlantic trip; and <a href="Stephen%20Hopkins%20%28settler%29">Stephen Hopkins</a>, a veteran of a failed colonial venture that may have inspired <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>". The group who later became the Leiden Leaders after the merging of ships included John Carver, William Bradford, Edward Winslow, William Brewster, and Isaac Allerton.

The "Mayflower" departed <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, <a href="England">England</a> on September 6, 1620 with 102 passengers and about 30 crew members in the small, 106 foot-long ship. The seas were not severe during the first month in the Atlantic but, by the second month, the ship was being hit by strong north-Atlantic winter gales, causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage. There were many obstacles throughout the trip, including multiple cases of seasickness and the bending and cracking of a main beam of the ship. One death occurred, that of William Button.

After two months at sea, land was sighted on November 9, 1620 off the coast of <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a>. They attempted to sail south to the designated landing site at the mouth of the Hudson but ran into trouble in the region of Pollack Rip, a shallow area of shoals between Cape Cod and <a href="Nantucket%20Island">Nantucket Island</a>. With winter approaching and provisions running dangerously low, the passengers decided to return north to Cape Cod Bay and abandon their original landing plans.

The Pilgrims were not the first Europeans in the area. <a href="John%20Cabot">John Cabot</a>'s discovery of <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> in 1497 had laid the foundation for the extensive English claims over the east coast of North America. One of the earliest maps of New England was produced by cartographer <a href="Giacomo%20Gastaldi">Giacomo Gastaldi</a> and erroneously identified <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Island">Cape Breton</a> with the <a href="Narragansett%20Bay">Narragansett Bay</a>. The resulting map completely omits most of the New England coast. European fishermen had been plying the waters off the New England coast for much of the 16th and 17th centuries.

Frenchman <a href="Samuel%20de%20Champlain">Samuel de Champlain</a> had explored the area extensively in 1605. He had specifically explored <a href="Plymouth%20Harbor">Plymouth Harbor</a>, which he called "Port St. Louis," and made an extensive and detailed map of it and the surrounding lands. The native <a href="Patuxet">Patuxet</a> village upon which the town of Plymouth was later built was shown by Champlain as a thriving settlement. However, an epidemic wiped out up to 90% of the Native Americans along the Massachusetts coast in 1617–1619, including the Patuxet, before the arrival of the "Mayflower". The epidemic has traditionally been thought to be smallpox, but a recent analysis has concluded that it may have been a lesser-known disease called <a href="leptospirosis">leptospirosis</a>. The absence of any serious native opposition to settlement by the Pilgrims may have been a pivotal event to their success and to English colonization in the Americas.

<a href="Popham%20Colony">Popham Colony</a>, also known as Fort St. George, was organized by the <a href="Plymouth%20Company">Plymouth Company</a> (unrelated to Plymouth Colony) and founded in 1607. It was settled on the coast of <a href="Maine">Maine</a> and was beset by internal political struggles, sickness, and weather problems. It was abandoned in 1608.

Captain <a href="John%20Smith%20of%20Jamestown">John Smith</a> of <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Virginia">Jamestown</a> fame had explored the area in 1614 and is credited with naming the region of New England. He named many locations using approximations of Native American words. The future site of the Pilgrim's first settlement was originally named "Accomack" by Smith. In consultation with <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Prince Charles</a>, son of King James, Smith changed "Accomack" to New Plymouth. A map published in his 1616 work "<a href="A%20Description%20of%20New%20England">A Description of New England</a>" clearly shows the site of the future Pilgrim settlement named "New Plimouth."

In the "Mayflower" settlers' first explorations of Cape Cod, they came across evidence that Europeans had previously spent extensive time there. They discovered remains of a European fort and uncovered a grave that contained the remains of both an adult European male and a Native American child.

The "Mayflower" anchored at <a href="Provincetown%20Harbor">Provincetown Harbor</a> on November 11, 1620. The Pilgrims did not have a patent to settle this area; thus, some passengers began to question their right to land, complaining that there was no legal authority to establish a colony. In response to this, a group of colonists drafted and ratified the first governing document of the colony, the <a href="Mayflower%20Compact">Mayflower Compact</a>, while still aboard the ship as it lay off-shore. The intent of the compact was to establish a means of governing the colony, though it did little more than confirm that the colony would be governed like any English town. It did, however, serve the purpose of relieving the concerns of many of the settlers. This <a href="social%20contract">social contract</a> was written and signed by 41 Separatist men. It was modeled on the church covenants that Congregationalists used to form new congregations. It made clear that the colony should be governed by "just and equal laws," and those who signed it promised to keep these laws.
The group remained on board the ship through the next day, a <a href="Sunday%23Sunday%20and%20Sabbath">Sunday</a>, for prayer and worship. The immigrants finally set foot on land at what became <a href="Provincetown">Provincetown</a> on November 13. The first task was to rebuild a <a href="shallop">shallop</a>, a shallow draft boat that had been built in England and disassembled for transport aboard the "Mayflower". It would remain with the Pilgrims while the "Mayflower" returned to England. On November 15, Captain Myles Standish led a party of sixteen men on an exploratory mission, during which they disturbed a Native American grave and located a buried cache of Indian corn. The following week, Susanna White gave birth to son <a href="Peregrine%20White">Peregrine White</a> on the "Mayflower". He was the first English child born to the Pilgrims in the New World. The shallop was finished on November 27, and a second expedition was undertaken using it, under the direction of "Mayflower" master <a href="Christopher%20Jones%20%28sailor%29">Christopher Jones</a>. Thirty-four men went, but the expedition was beset by bad weather; the only positive result was that they found a Native burial ground and corn that had been intended for the dead, taking the corn for future planting. A third expedition along Cape Cod left on December 6; it resulted in a skirmish with local Native Americans known as the "First Encounter" near modern-day <a href="Eastham%2C%20Massachusetts">Eastham, Massachusetts</a>. The colonists decided to look elsewhere, having failed to secure a proper site for their settlement, and fearing that they had angered the local Native Americans by robbing their corn stores and firing upon them. The "Mayflower" left Provincetown Harbor and set sail for Plymouth Harbor.

The "Mayflower" dropped anchor in Plymouth Harbor on December 16 and spent three days looking for a settlement site. They rejected several sites, including one on <a href="Clark%27s%20Island">Clark's Island</a> and another at the mouth of the <a href="Jones%20River">Jones River</a>, in favor of the site of a recently abandoned Native American settlement which had been occupied by the <a href="Patuxet">Patuxet</a>. The location was chosen largely for its defensive position. The settlement would be centered on two hills: Cole's Hill, where the village would be built, and Fort Hill, where a defensive cannon would be stationed. Also important in choosing the site was that the prior Native villagers had cleared much of the land making agriculture relatively easy. Fresh water for the colony was provided by <a href="Town%20Brook%20%28Massachusetts%29">Town Brook</a> and <a href="Billington%20Sea">Billington Sea</a>. There are no contemporaneous accounts to verify the legend, but <a href="Plymouth%20Rock">Plymouth Rock</a> is often hailed as the point where the colonists first set foot on their new homeland.

The area where the colonists settled had been identified as "New Plymouth" in maps by <a href="John%20Smith%20%28explorer%29">John Smith</a> published in 1614. The colonists elected to retain the name for their own settlement, in honor of their final point of departure from England: <a href="Plymouth%2C%20Devon">Plymouth, Devon</a>.

On December 21, 1620, the first landing party arrived at the site of <a href="Plimoth%20Plantation">Plymouth</a>. Plans to build houses, however, were delayed by bad weather until December 23. As the building progressed, 20 men always remained ashore for security purposes while the rest of the work crews returned each night to the "Mayflower". Women, children, and the infirm remained on board the "Mayflower", and many had not left the ship for six months. The first structure was a common house of <a href="wattle%20and%20daub">wattle and daub</a>, and it took two weeks to complete in the harsh New England winter. In the following weeks, the rest of the settlement slowly took shape. The living and working structures were built on the relatively flat top of Cole's Hill, and a wooden platform was constructed atop nearby Fort Hill to support the cannon that would defend the settlement.

During the winter, the "Mayflower" colonists suffered greatly from lack of shelter, diseases such as <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>, and general conditions onboard ship. Many of the able-bodied men were too infirm to work; 45 out of 102 pilgrims died and were buried on <a href="Cole%27s%20Hill">Cole's Hill</a>. Thus, only seven residences and four common houses were constructed during the first winter out of a planned 19. By the end of January, enough of the settlement had been built to begin unloading provisions from the "Mayflower".

The men of the settlement organized themselves into military orders in mid-February, after several tense encounters with local Indians, and Myles Standish was designated as the commanding officer. By the end of the month, five cannons had been defensively positioned on Fort Hill. <a href="John%20Carver%20%28Mayflower%20passenger%29">John Carver</a> was elected governor to replace Governor Martin.

On March 16, 1621, the first formal contact occurred with the Indians. <a href="Samoset">Samoset</a> was an <a href="Abenaki">Abenaki</a> <a href="Sagamore%20%28title%29">sagamore</a> who was originally from <a href="Bristol%2C%20Maine">Pemaquid Point</a> in <a href="Maine">Maine</a>. He had learned some English from fishermen and trappers in Maine, and he walked boldly into the midst of the settlement and proclaimed, "Welcome, Englishmen!" It was during this meeting that the Pilgrims learned how the previous residents of Patuxet had died of an epidemic. They also learned that one leader of the region was <a href="Wampanoag%20people">Wampanoag</a> Indian chief <a href="Massasoit">Massasoit</a>, and they learned about <a href="Squanto">Squanto</a> (Tisquantum) who was the sole survivor from Patuxet. Squanto had spent time in Europe and spoke English quite well. Samoset spent the night in Plymouth and agreed to arrange a meeting with some of Massasoit's men.

Massasoit and Squanto were apprehensive about the Pilgrims. In Massasoit's first contact with the English, several men of his tribe had been killed by English sailors. He also knew that the Pilgrims had taken some corn stores in their landings at Provincetown. Squanto himself had been abducted in 1614 by English explorer Thomas Hunt and had spent five years in Europe, first as a slave for a group of Spanish monks, then as a freeman in England. He had returned to New England in 1619, acting as a guide to explorer Capt. <a href="Robert%20Gorges">Robert Gorges</a>, but Massasoit and his men had massacred the crew of the ship and had taken Squanto.

Samoset returned to Plymouth on March 22 with a delegation from Massasoit that included Squanto; Massasoit joined them shortly after, and he and Governor Carver established a formal treaty of peace after exchanging gifts. This treaty ensured that each people would not bring harm to the other, that Massasoit would send his allies to make peaceful negotiations with Plymouth, and that they would come to each other's aid in a time of war.

The "Mayflower" set sail for England on April 5, 1621, after being anchored for almost four months in <a href="Plymouth%20Harbor">Plymouth Harbor</a>. Nearly half of the original 102 passengers had died during the first winter. As William Bradford wrote, "of these one hundred persons who came over in this first ship together, the greatest half died in the general mortality, and most of them in two or three months' time". By November 1621, only 53 pilgrims were alive to celebrate the harvest feast which modern Americans know as "The First <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a>". Thirteen of the 18 adult women died the first winter, while another died in May. Only four adult women were left alive for the Thanksgiving.

Several of the graves on Cole's Hill were uncovered in 1855; their bodies were disinterred and moved to a site near Plymouth Rock.

The first Thanksgiving was actually a solemn ceremony in 1623 of praise and thanks to God for the colony's good fortune, in response to the arrival of additional colonists and supplies. That event probably occurred in July and consisted of a full day of prayer and worship and probably very little revelry.

The event now commemorated in the United States at the end of November each year is more properly described as a <a href="harvest%20festival">harvest festival</a>. The original festival was probably held in early October 1621 and was celebrated by the 53 surviving Pilgrims, along with Massasoit and 90 of his men. Three contemporaneous accounts of the event survive: "<a href="Of%20Plymouth%20Plantation">Of Plymouth Plantation</a>" by William Bradford; "<a href="Mourt%27s%20Relation">Mourt's Relation</a>" probably written by Edward Winslow; and "New England's Memorial" by Plymouth Colony Secretary (and Bradford's nephew) Capt. <a href="Nathaniel%20Morton">Nathaniel Morton</a>. The celebration lasted three days and featured a feast that included numerous types of waterfowl, wild turkeys and fish procured by the colonists, and five deer brought by the Indians.

After the departure of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, for example using dead fish to fertilize the soil. For the first few years of colonial life, the <a href="North%20American%20fur%20trade">fur trade</a> was the dominant source of income, buying furs from Native Americans and selling to Europeans, beyond subsistence farming. Shortly after the departure of the "Mayflower", Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.

As promised by Massasoit, numerous Native Americans arrived at Plymouth throughout the middle of 1621 with pledges of peace. On July 2, a party of Pilgrims led by Edward Winslow (who later became the chief diplomat of the colony) set out to continue negotiations with the chief. The delegation also included Squanto, who acted as a translator. After traveling for several days, they arrived at Massasoit's capital, the village of Sowams near <a href="Narragansett%20Bay">Narragansett Bay</a>. After meals and an exchange of gifts, Massasoit agreed to an exclusive trading pact with the English; thus, the French were no longer welcome, though they were also frequent traders in the area. Squanto remained behind and traveled throughout the area to establish trading relations with several tribes.

In late July, a boy named John Billington became lost for some time in the woods around the colony. It was reported that he was found by the <a href="Nauset">Nauset</a>, the same group of Native Americans on Cape Cod from whom the Pilgrims had unwittingly stolen corn seed the prior year upon their first explorations. The English organized a party to return Billington to Plymouth. The Pilgrims agreed to reimburse the Nauset for the corn which they had taken in return for the Billington boy. This negotiation did much to secure further peace with the Native Americans in the area.

During their dealings with the Nausets over the release of John Billington, the Pilgrims learned of troubles that Massasoit was experiencing. Massasoit, Squanto, and several other Wampanoags had been captured by <a href="Corbitant">Corbitant</a>, <a href="sachem">sachem</a> of the <a href="Narragansett%20%28tribe%29">Narragansett</a> tribe. A party of ten men under the leadership of Myles Standish set out to find and execute Corbitant. While hunting for Corbitant, they learned that Squanto had escaped and Massasoit was back in power. Several Native Americans had been injured by Standish and his men and were offered medical attention in Plymouth. They had failed to capture Corbitant, but the show of force by Standish had garnered respect for the Pilgrims and, as a result, nine of the most powerful sachems in the area signed a treaty in September, including Massasoit and Corbitant, pledging their loyalty to King James.

In May 1622, a vessel named the "Sparrow" arrived carrying seven men from the Merchant Adventurers whose purpose was to seek out a site for a new settlement in the area. Two ships followed shortly thereafter carrying sixty settlers, all men. They spent July and August in Plymouth before moving north to settle in modern <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Massachusetts">Weymouth, Massachusetts</a> at a settlement which they named <a href="Wessagussett">Wessagussett</a>. The settlement of Wessagussett was short-lived, but it provided the spark for an event that dramatically changed the political landscape between the local Native American tribes and the English settlers. Reports reached Plymouth of a military threat to Wessagussett, and Myles Standish organized a militia to defend them. However, he found that there had been no attack. He therefore decided on a pre-emptive strike, an event which historian <a href="Nathaniel%20Philbrick">Nathaniel Philbrick</a> calls "Standish's raid". He lured two prominent Massachusett military leaders into a house at Wessagussett under the pretense of sharing a meal and making negotiations. Standish and his men then stabbed and killed the two unsuspecting Native Americans. The local sachem named Obtakiest was pursued by Standish and his men but escaped with three English prisoners from Wessagussett, whom he then executed. Within a short time, Wessagussett was disbanded, and the survivors were integrated into the town of Plymouth.

Word quickly spread among the Native American tribes of Standish's attack; many Native Americans abandoned their villages and fled the area. As noted by Philbrick: "Standish's raid had irreparably damaged the human ecology of the region ... It was some time before a new equilibrium came to the region." <a href="Edward%20Winslow">Edward Winslow</a> reports in his 1624 memoirs "Good News from New England" that "they forsook their houses, running to and fro like men distracted, living in swamps and other desert places, and so brought manifold diseases amongst themselves, whereof very many are dead". Lacking the trade in furs provided by the local tribes, the Pilgrims lost their main source of income for paying off their debts to the Merchant Adventurers. Rather than strengthening their position, Standish's raid had disastrous consequences for the colony, as attested by William Bradford in a letter to the Merchant Adventurers: "[W]e had much damaged our trade, for there where we had [the] most skins the Indians are run away from their habitations". The only positive effect of Standish's raid seemed to be the increased power of the Massasoit-led Wampanoag tribe, the Pilgrims' closest ally in the region.

A second ship arrived in November 1621 named the "<a href="Fortune%20%28Plymouth%20Colony%20ship%29">Fortune</a>", sent by the Merchant Adventurers one year after the Pilgrims first set foot in New England. It arrived with 37 new settlers for Plymouth. However, the ship had arrived unexpectedly and also without many supplies, so the additional settlers put a strain on the resources of the colony. Among the passengers of the "Fortune" were several additional people of the original Leiden congregation, including <a href="William%20Brewster%20%28Mayflower%20passenger%29">William Brewster</a>'s son Jonathan, Edward Winslow's brother John, and <a href="Philip%20Delano">Philip Delano</a> (the family name was earlier "de la Noye") whose descendants include <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>. The "Fortune" also carried a letter from the Merchant Adventurers chastising the colony for failure to return goods with the "Mayflower" that had been promised in return for their support. The "Fortune" began its return to England laden with £500 worth of goods (equivalent to £ in 2010, or $ at <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">PPP</a>), more than enough to keep the colonists on schedule for repayment of their debt. However, the "Fortune" was captured by the French before she could deliver her cargo to England, creating an even larger deficit for the colony.

In July 1623, two more ships arrived: the <a href="The%20Anne%20and%20the%20Little%20James%201623">"Anne"</a>, under the command of Captain "Master" William Peirce and Master John Bridges; and the <a href="The%20Anne%20and%20the%20Little%20James%201623">"Little James"</a>, under the command of Captain Emanuel Altham. These ships carried 96 new settlers, among them <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a>ers, including <a href="William%20Bradford%20%28Plymouth%20governor%29">William Bradford</a>'s future wife Alice, and William and Mary Brewster's daughters Patience and Fear. Some of the passengers who arrived on the "Anne" were either unprepared for frontier life or undesirable additions to the colony and returned to England the next year. According to Gleason Archer, "those who remained were not willing to join the colony under the terms of the agreement with the Merchant Adventurers. They had embarked for America upon an understanding with the Adventurers that they might settle in a community of their own, or at least be free from the bonds by which the Plymouth colonists were enslaved. A letter addressed to the colonists and signed by thirteen of the merchants recited these facts and urged acceptance of the new comers on the specified terms." The new arrivals were allotted land in the area of the <a href="Eel%20River%20%28Massachusetts%29">Eel River</a>, known as <a href="Hobs%20Hole">Hobs Hole</a>, which became Wellingsley, a mile south of Plymouth Rock.

In September 1623, another ship arrived carrying settlers destined to refound the failed colony at Weymouth, and they stayed temporarily in Plymouth. In March 1624, a ship arrived bearing a few additional settlers and the first cattle. A 1627 division of cattle lists 156 colonists divided into twelve lots of thirteen colonists each. Another ship arrived in August 1629, also named the "Mayflower", with 35 additional members of the Leiden congregation. Ships arrived throughout the period between 1629 and 1630 carrying new settlers, though the exact number is unknown; contemporaneous documents claimed that, by January 1630, the colony had almost 300 people. In 1643, the colony had an estimated 600 males fit for military service, implying a total population of about 2,000. By 1690, on the eve of the dissolution of the colony, the estimated total population of Plymouth County, the most populous, was 3,055 people. It is estimated that the entire population of the colony at the point of its dissolution was around 7,000. For comparison, it is estimated that more than 20,000 settlers had arrived in Massachusetts Bay Colony between 1630 and 1640 (a period known as the <a href="Great%20Migration%20%28Puritan%29">Great Migration</a>), and the English population of all New England was estimated to be about 60,000 by 1678. Plymouth was the first colony in the region but, by the time of its annexation, it was much smaller than Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Myles Standish was the military leader of Plymouth Colony from the beginning. He organized and led the first party to set foot in New England, an exploratory expedition of Cape Cod upon arrival in Provincetown Harbor. He also led the third expedition, during which Standish fired the first recorded shot by the Pilgrim settlers in an event known as the First Encounter. Standish had training in <a href="military%20engineering">military engineering</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Leiden">University of Leiden</a>, and it was he who decided the defensive layout of the settlement when they finally arrived at Plymouth. Standish also organized the able-bodied men into military orders in February of the first winter. During the second winter, he helped design and organize the construction of a large palisade wall surrounding the settlement. Standish led two early military raids on Indian villages: the raid to find and punish Corbitant for his attempted coup, and the killing at Wessagussett called "Standish's raid". The former had the desired effect of gaining the respect of the local Indians; the latter only served to frighten and scatter them, resulting in loss of trade and income.

The first major war in New England was the Pequot War of 1637. The war's roots go back to 1632, when a dispute arose between Dutch fur traders and Plymouth officials over control of the <a href="Connecticut%20River%20Valley">Connecticut River Valley</a> near modern <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a>. Representatives from the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a> and Plymouth Colony both had deeds which claimed that they had rightfully purchased the land from the <a href="Pequot">Pequot</a>s. A sort of <a href="land%20run">land rush</a> occurred as settlers from Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies tried to beat the Dutch in settling the area; the influx of English settlers also threatened the Pequot. Other confederations in the area sided with the English, including the <a href="Narragansett%20%28tribe%29">Narragansetts</a> and <a href="Mohegan">Mohegan</a>s, who were the traditional enemies of the Pequots. The event that sparked formal hostilities was the capture of a boat and the murder of its captain John Oldham in 1636, an event blamed on allies of the Pequots. In April 1637, a raid on a Pequot village by <a href="John%20Endicott">John Endicott</a> led to a retaliatory raid by Pequot warriors on the town of <a href="Wethersfield%2C%20Connecticut">Wethersfield, Connecticut</a>, where some 30 English settlers were killed. This led to a further retaliation, where a raid led by <a href="Captain%20John%20Underhill">Captain John Underhill</a> and Captain <a href="John%20Mason%20%28c.%201600%E2%80%931672%29">John Mason</a> burned a Pequot village to the ground near modern <a href="Mystic%2C%20Connecticut">Mystic, Connecticut</a>, killing 300 Pequots. Plymouth Colony had little to do with the actual fighting in the war.

When it appeared that the war would resume, four of the New England colonies (Massachusetts Bay, <a href="Connecticut%20Colony">Connecticut</a>, <a href="New%20Haven%20Colony">New Haven</a>, and Plymouth) formed a defensive compact known as the <a href="United%20Colonies%20of%20New%20England">United Colonies of New England</a>. Edward Winslow was already known for his diplomatic skills, and he was the chief architect of the United Colonies. His experience in the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">United Provinces of the Netherlands</a> during the Leiden years was key to organizing the confederation. <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> later considered the United Colonies to be the prototype for the <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>, which was the first attempt at a national government.

<a href="Metacomet">King Philip</a> was the younger son of Massasoit and the heir of Massasoit's position as sachem of the Pokanoket and supreme leader of the Wampanoag. (He was also known as Metacomet and other variations on that name.) He became sachem upon the sudden death of his older brother <a href="Wamsutta">Wamsutta</a>, also known as Alexander, in 1662.

The cause of the war stems from the increasing numbers of English colonists and their demand for land. As more land was purchased from the Native Americans, they were restricted to smaller territories for themselves. Native American leaders such as King Philip resented the loss of land and looked for a means to slow or reverse it. Of specific concern was the founding of the town of <a href="Swansea%2C%20Massachusetts">Swansea</a>, which was located only a few miles from the Wampanoag capital at <a href="Mount%20Hope%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Mount Hope</a>. The <a href="General%20Court%20of%20Plymouth">General Court of Plymouth</a> began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.
The proximate cause of the conflict was the death of a <a href="Praying%20Indian">Praying Indian</a> named <a href="John%20Sassamon">John Sassamon</a> in 1675. Sassamon had been an advisor and friend to King Philip; however, Sassamon's conversion to Christianity had driven the two apart. Accused in the murder of Sassamon were some of Philip's most senior lieutenants. A jury of twelve Englishmen and six Praying Indians found the Native Americans guilty of murder and sentenced them to death. To this day, some debate exists whether King Philip's men actually committed the murder.

Philip had already begun war preparations at his home base near <a href="Mount%20Hope%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Mount Hope</a> where he started raiding English farms and pillaging their property. In response, Governor <a href="Josiah%20Winslow">Josiah Winslow</a> called out the militia, and they organized and began to move on Philip's position. King Philip's men attacked unarmed women and children in order to receive a ransom. One such attack resulted in the capture of <a href="Mary%20Rowlandson">Mary Rowlandson</a>. The memoirs of her capture provided historians with much information on Native American culture during this time period.

The war continued through the rest of 1675 and into the next year. The English were constantly frustrated by the Native Americans' refusal to meet them in pitched battle. They employed a form of <a href="guerilla%20warfare">guerilla warfare</a> that confounded the English. Captain <a href="Benjamin%20Church%20%28ranger%29">Benjamin Church</a> continuously campaigned to enlist the help of friendly Native Americans to help learn how to fight on an even footing with Philip's warrior bands, but he was constantly rebuffed by the Plymouth leadership who mistrusted all Native Americans, thinking them potential enemies. Eventually, Governor Winslow and Plymouth military commander Major <a href="William%20Bradford%20%281624%E2%80%931703%29">William Bradford</a> (son of the late Governor William Bradford) relented and gave Church permission to organize a combined force of English and Native Americans. After securing the alliance of the Sakonnet, he led his combined force in pursuit of Philip, who had thus far avoided any major battles in the war that bears his name. Throughout July 1676, Church's band captured hundreds of Native American warriors, often without much of a fight, though Philip eluded him. Church was given permission to grant amnesty to any captured Native Americans who would agree to join the English side, and his force grew immensely. Philip was killed by a Pocasset Indian, and the war soon ended as an overwhelming English victory.

Eight percent of the English adult male population is estimated to have died during the war, a rather large percentage by most standards. The impact on the Native Americans was far higher, however. So many were killed, fled, or shipped off as slaves that the entire Native American population of New England fell by sixty to eighty percent.

In 1686, the entire region was reorganized under a single government known as the <a href="Dominion%20of%20New%20England">Dominion of New England</a>; this included the colonies of Plymouth, <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Rhode Island</a>, <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay</a>, <a href="Connecticut%20Colony">Connecticut</a>, and <a href="New%20Hampshire%20Colony">New Hampshire</a>. In 1688, <a href="Province%20of%20New%20York">New York</a>, <a href="West%20Jersey">West Jersey</a>, and <a href="East%20Jersey">East Jersey</a> were added. The President of the Dominion <a href="Edmund%20Andros">Edmund Andros</a> was highly unpopular, and the union did not last. The union was dissolved after news of the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> reached Boston in April 1689, and the citizens of Boston <a href="1689%20Boston%20revolt">rose up</a> and arrested Andros. When news of these events reached Plymouth, its magistrates reclaimed power.

The return of self-rule for Plymouth Colony was short-lived, however. A delegation of New Englanders led by <a href="Increase%20Mather">Increase Mather</a> went to England to negotiate a return of the colonial charters that had been nullified during the Dominion years. The situation was particularly problematic for Plymouth Colony, as it had existed without a formal charter since its founding. Plymouth did not get its wish for a formal charter; instead, a new charter was issued, combining Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts Bay Colony, and other territories. The official date of the proclamation was October 17, 1691, ending the existence of Plymouth Colony, though it was not put into force until the arrival of the charter of the <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a> on May 14, 1692, carried by the new royal governor Sir <a href="William%20Phips">William Phips</a>. The last official meeting of the <a href="Plymouth%20General%20Court">Plymouth General Court</a> occurred on June 8, 1692.

The most important religious figure in the colony was <a href="John%20Robinson%20%28pastor%29">John Robinson</a>, an original pastor of the <a href="Scrooby%20congregation">Scrooby congregation</a> and religious leader of the separatists throughout the Leiden years. He never actually set foot in New England, but many of his theological pronouncements shaped the nature and character of the Plymouth church. For example, Robinson stated that women and men have different social roles according to a law of nature, though neither was lesser in the eyes of God. Robinson taught that men and women have distinct but complementary roles in church, home, and society as a whole. He referred to women as the "weaker vessel". In matters of religious understanding, he proclaimed that it was the man's role to educate and "guide and go before" women. He also said that women should be "subject" to their husbands. Robinson also dictated the proper methods of child rearing—he prescribed a strict upbringing with a strong emphasis on <a href="corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment</a>. He believed that a child's natural inclination towards independence was a manifestation of <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a> and should thus be repressed.

The Pilgrims themselves were a part of the English Separatists (also known as <a href="English%20Dissenters">English Dissenters</a>) who were <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="Christians">Christians</a> who separated from the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. The movement sought to practice Christianity as was done in the times of the <a href="Apostle">Apostle</a>s. Following <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>'s and <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>'s <a href="Reformation">Reformation</a>, they believed that the Bible was the only true source of religious teaching and that any additions made to Christianity had no place in Christian practice, especially with regard to church traditions, such as clerical vestments or the use of Latin in church services. In particular, they were strongly opposed to the Anglicans' episcopal form of church government. They believed that the church was a community of Christians who made a covenant with God and with one another. Their congregations had a democratic structure. Ministers, teachers, and lay church elders were elected by and responsible to the entire congregation (<a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> <a href="Federalism">Federalism</a>). Each congregation was independent of all the others and directly subject to God's (or Christ's) government (<a href="theocracy">theocracy</a>), hence the name <a href="Congregationalist%20polity">Congregationalism</a>. The Pilgrims distinguished themselves from the Puritans in that they sought to "separate" themselves from the Anglican Church, rather than reform it from within. It was this desire to worship from outside of the Anglican Communion that led them first to the Netherlands and ultimately to New England.

Each town in the colony was considered a single church congregation; in later years, some of the larger towns split into two or three congregations. Church attendance was mandatory for all residents of the colony, while church membership was restricted to those who had converted to the faith. In Plymouth Colony, it seems that a simple <a href="Profession%20%28religious%29">profession of faith</a> was all that was required for acceptance. This was a more liberal doctrine than some other New England congregations, such as those of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where it was common to subject those seeking formal membership to strict and detailed cross-examinations. There was no central governing body for the churches. Each individual congregation was left to determine its own standards of membership, hire its own ministers, and conduct its own business.

The church was undoubtedly the most important social institution in the colony. The Bible was the primary religious document of the society, and it also served as the primary legal document. Church attendance was not only mandatory, but membership was socially vital. Education was carried out for almost purely religious purposes. The laws of the colony specifically asked parents to provide for the education of their children, "at least to be able duly to read the Scriptures" and to understand "the main Grounds and Principles of Christian Religion". It was expected that the male head of the household would be responsible for the religious well-being of all its members, children and servants alike.

Most churches used two acts to sanction its members: <a href="censure">censure</a> and <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a>. Censure was a formal reprimand for behavior that did not conform with accepted religious and social norms, while excommunication involved full removal from church membership. Many perceived social evils, from fornication to public drunkenness, were dealt with through church discipline rather than through civil punishment. Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.

The Pilgrims practiced <a href="infant%20baptism">infant baptism</a>. The public baptism ceremony was usually performed within six months of birth.

Marriage was considered a civil ceremony, rather than a religious one. Such an arrangement may have been a habit that had developed during the Leiden years, as civil marriage was common in the Netherlands. However, the Pilgrims saw this arrangement as biblical, there being no evidence from Scripture that a minister should preside over a wedding.

Besides the theology espoused by their religious leaders, the people of Plymouth Colony had a strong belief in the supernatural. <a href="Richard%20Greenham">Richard Greenham</a> was a Puritan theologian whose works were known to the Plymouth residents, and he counseled extensively against turning to magic or wizardry to solve problems. The Pilgrims saw Satan's work in nearly every calamity that befell them; the dark magical arts were very real and present for them. They believed in the presence of malevolent spirits who brought misfortune to people. For example, in 1660, a court inquest into the drowning death of Jeremiah Burroughs determined that a possessed canoe was to blame. Massachusetts Bay Colony experienced an outbreak of <a href="Salem%20witch%20trials">witchcraft scares</a> in the 17th century, but there is little evidence that Plymouth was engulfed in anything similar. <a href="Witchcraft">Witchcraft</a> was listed as a capital crime in the 1636 codification of the laws by the Plymouth General Court, but there were no actual convictions of witches in Plymouth Colony. The court records only show two formal accusations of witchcraft. The first, of Goodwife Holmes in 1661, never went to trial. The second, of Mary Ingram in 1677, resulted in trial and acquittal.

<a href="Edward%20Winslow">Edward Winslow</a> and Susanna White both lost their spouses during the harsh winter of 1620–1621, and the two became the first couple to be married in Plymouth. Governor Bradford presided over the civil ceremony.

In Plymouth Colony, "<a href="courtship">courtship</a>s were usually initiated by the young people themselves, but as a relationship progressed toward something more permanent, the parents became more directly involved." Parents were concerned with the moral and religious qualities of the proposed spouse, as well as the financial means of each party's family. The first step toward marriage was generally a <a href="betrothal">betrothal</a> or pre-contract, a ceremony carried out before two witnesses in which the couple pledged to wed in due time. Several weeks or months after the betrothal was contracted, the couple's intentions were published. "A betrothed couple was considered to have a special status, not married but no longer unmarried either." Sexual contact was prohibited between a betrothed couple, but the penalty for it was one-fourth of what it was for single persons, and records indicate a relatively high number of babies born less than nine months after a wedding ceremony.

Marriage was considered the normal state for all adult residents of the colony. Most men first married in their mid-twenties and women around age 20. Second marriages were not uncommon, and widows and widowers faced social and economic pressures to remarry. On average, most widows and widowers remarried within six months to a year. Most adults who reached marriageable age lived into their sixties, so effectively two-thirds of a person's life was spent married.

Women in Plymouth Colony had more extensive legal and social rights compared to 17th-century European norms. Women were considered equal to men before God from the perspective of the Church. God's grace was available equally to all professed Christians. Women were, however, expected to take traditionally feminine roles, such as child-rearing and maintaining the household.

Plymouth women enjoyed extensive property and legal rights, unlike in Europe where women had few rights. A wife in Plymouth could not be legally "written out" of her husband's will and was guaranteed a full third of the family's property upon his death. Women were parties to contracts in Plymouth, most notably <a href="prenuptial%20agreement">prenuptial agreement</a>s. It was common for brides-to-be (and not, notably, their fathers) to enter into contractual agreements on the consolidation of property upon marriage. In some cases, especially in second marriages, women were given exclusive right to retain control of their property separately from their husbands. Women were also known to occasionally sit on juries in Plymouth, a remarkable circumstance in seventeenth century legal practice. Historians James and Patricia Scott Deetz cite a 1678 inquest into the death of Anne Batson's child, where the jury was composed of five women and seven men.

Family size in the colony was large by modern American standards, though childbirth was often spaced out, with an average of two years between children. Most families averaged five to six children living under the same roof, though it would not be uncommon for one family to have grown children moving out before the mother had finished giving birth. <a href="Maternal%20mortality">Maternal mortality</a> rates were fairly high; one birth in thirty resulted in the death of the mother, resulting in one in five women <a href="Maternal%20death">dying in childbirth</a>. However, "the rate of <a href="infant%20mortality">infant mortality</a> in Plymouth seems to have been relatively low. In the case of a few families for which there are unusually complete records, only about one in five children seems to have died before the age of twenty-one. Furthermore, births in the sample [of about 90 families] come for the most part with relatively few 'gaps' which might indicate a baby who did not survive. All things considered, it appears that the rate of infant and child mortality in Plymouth was no more than 25 per cent".

Children generally remained in the direct care of their mothers until the age of about eight years old, after which time it was not uncommon for the child to be placed in the foster care of another family. There were any number of reasons for a child to be "put-out" in this manner. Some children were placed into households to learn a trade, others to be taught to read and write. It seems that there was a theological reason for fostering children, as with almost every decision in the colony. It was assumed that children's own parents would love them too much and would not properly discipline them. By placing children in the care of another family, there was little danger of them being spoiled.

Adolescence was not a recognized phase of life in Plymouth colony, and there was not a single rite of passage that marked transition from youth to adulthood. Several important transitions occurred at various ages, but none marked a single "coming of age" event. As early as eight years old, children were expected to begin learning their adult roles in life by taking on some of the family work or by being placed in foster homes to learn a trade. Most children experienced <a href="religious%20conversion">religious conversion</a> around the age of eight as well, thus becoming church members. 
Orphaned children were given the right to choose their own guardians at age 14. At 16, males became eligible for military duty and were also considered adults for legal purposes, such as standing trial for crimes. Age 21 was the youngest at which a male could become a freeman, though for practical purposes this occurred some time in a man's mid-twenties. Twenty-one was the assumed age of inheritance, as well, although the law respected the rights of the deceased to name an earlier age in his will.

Actual schools were rare in Plymouth colony. The first true school was not founded until 40 years after the foundation of the colony. The General Court first authorized colony-wide funding for formal public schooling in 1673, but only the town of Plymouth made use of these funds at that time. By 1683, though, five additional towns had received this funding.

Education of the young was never considered to be the primary domain of schools, even after they had become more common. Most education was carried out by a child's parents or foster parents. Formal apprenticeships were not the norm in Plymouth; it was expected that a foster family would teach the children whatever trades they themselves practiced. The church also played a central role in a child's education. As noted above, the primary purpose of teaching children to read was so that they could read the Bible for themselves.

Plymouth Colony did not have a royal charter authorizing it to form a government, yet some means of governance was needed. The <a href="Mayflower%20Compact">Mayflower Compact</a> was the colony's first governing document, signed by the 41 able-bodied Separatists aboard the "Mayflower" upon their arrival in Provincetown Harbor on November 21, 1620. Formal laws were not codified until 1636. The colony's laws were based on a hybrid of English <a href="common%20law">common law</a> and religious law as laid out in the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. The colonial authorities were deeply influenced by Calvinist theology, and were convinced that democracy was the form of government mandated by God.

The colony offered nearly all adult males potential citizenship. Full citizens, or "freemen", were accorded full rights and privileges in areas such as voting and holding office. To be considered a freeman, adult males had to be sponsored by an existing freeman and accepted by the General Court. Later restrictions established a one-year waiting period between nominating and granting of freeman status, and also placed religious restrictions on the colony's citizens, specifically preventing <a href="Quakers">Quakers</a> from becoming freemen. Freeman status was also restricted by age; the official minimum age was 21, although in practice most men were elevated to freeman status between the ages of 25 and 40, averaging somewhere in their early thirties. The colony established a disabled veterans' fund in 1636 to support veterans who returned from service with disabilities. In 1641, the Body of Liberties developed protections for people who were unable to perform public service.
The colony's most powerful executive was its Governor, who was originally elected by the freemen but was later appointed by the General Court in an annual election. The General Court also elected seven Assistants to form a <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a> to assist the governor. The Governor and Assistants then appointed Constables who served as the chief administrators for the towns, and Messengers who were the main civil servants of the colony. They were responsible for publishing announcements, performing land surveys, carrying out executions, and a host of other duties.

The General Court was the chief legislative and judicial body of the colony. It was elected by the freemen from among their own number and met regularly in Plymouth, the capital town of the colony. As part of its judicial duties, it would periodically call a Grand Enquest, which was a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> of sorts elected from the freemen, who would hear complaints and swear out indictments for credible accusations. The General Court, and later lesser town and county courts, would preside over trials of accused criminals and over civil matters, but the ultimate decisions were made by a jury of freemen.

The General Court, as the legislative and judicial bodies, and the Governor, as the chief executive of the colony, constituted a political system of <a href="division%20of%20power">division of power</a>. It followed a recommendation in John Calvin's political theory to set up several institutions which complement and control each other in a system of <a href="Separation%20of%20powers%23Checks_and_balances">checks and balances</a> in order to minimize the misuse of political power. In 1625, the settlers had repaid their debts and thus gained complete possession of the colony. The colony was a de facto republic, since neither an English company nor the King and Parliament exerted any influence—a representative democracy governed on the principles of the Mayflower Compact ("self-rule").

As a legislative body, the General Court could make proclamations of law as needed. These laws were not formally compiled anywhere in the early years of the colony; they were first organized and published in the "1636 Book of Laws". The book was reissued in 1658, 1672, and 1685. These laws included the levying of "rates" or taxes and the distribution of colony lands. The General Court established townships as a means of providing local government over settlements, but reserved for itself the right to control specific distribution of land to individuals within those towns. When new land was granted to a freeman, it was directed that only the person to whom the land was granted was allowed to settle it. It was forbidden for individual settlers to purchase land from Native Americans without formal permission from the General Court. The government recognized the precarious peace that existed with the Wampanoag, and wished to avoid antagonizing them by buying up all of their land.

The laws also set out crimes and their associated punishment. There were several crimes that carried the <a href="death%20penalty">death penalty</a>: <a href="treason">treason</a>, <a href="murder">murder</a>, <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, <a href="arson">arson</a>, <a href="sodomy">sodomy</a>, <a href="rape">rape</a>, <a href="bestiality">bestiality</a>, <a href="adultery">adultery</a>, and cursing or smiting one's parents. The actual exercise of the death penalty was fairly rare; only one sex-related crime resulted in execution, a 1642 incidence of bestiality by Thomas Granger. Edward Bumpus was sentenced to death for "striking and abusing his parents" in 1679, but his sentence was commuted to a severe whipping by reason of insanity. Perhaps the most notable use of the death penalty was in the execution of the Native Americans convicted of the murder of John Sassamon; this helped lead to King Philip's War. Though nominally a capital crime, adultery was usually dealt with by public humiliation only. Convicted adulterers were often forced to wear the letters "A.D." sewn into their garments, much in the manner of <a href="Hester%20Prynne">Hester Prynne</a> in <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Scarlet%20Letter">The Scarlet Letter</a>".

Several laws dealt with <a href="indentured%20servitude">indentured servitude</a>, a legal status whereby a person would work off debts or be given training in exchange for a period of unrecompensed service. The law required that all indentured servants had to be registered by the Governor or one of the Assistants, and that no period of indenture could be less than six months. Further laws forbade a master from shortening the length of time of service required for his servant, and also confirmed that any indentured servants whose period of service began in England would still be required to complete their service while in Plymouth.

The seal of the Plymouth Colony was designed in 1629 and is still used by the town of Plymouth. It depicts four figures within a shield bearing <a href="St%20George%27s%20Cross">St George's Cross</a>, apparently in Native-American style clothing, each carrying the burning heart symbol of <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>. The seal was also used by the County of Plymouth until 1931.

Without a clear land patent for the area, the settlers settled without a charter to form a government and, as a result, it was often unclear in the early years what land was under the colony's jurisdiction. In 1644, "The Old Colony Line"—which had been surveyed in 1639—was formally accepted as the boundary between Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth.

The situation was more complicated along the border with Rhode Island. <a href="Roger%20Williams%20%28theologian%29">Roger Williams</a> settled in the area of <a href="Pawtucket%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Rehoboth</a> in 1636, near modern <a href="Pawtucket%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Pawtucket</a>. He was forcibly evicted in order to maintain Plymouth's claim to the area. Williams moved to the west side of the Pawtucket River to found the settlement of <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence</a>, the nucleus for the colony of Rhode Island, which was formally established with the "Providence Plantations Patent" of 1644. Various settlers from both Rhode Island and Plymouth began to settle along the area, and the exact nature of the western boundary of Plymouth became unclear. The issue was not fully resolved until the 1740s, long after the dissolution of Plymouth Colony itself. Rhode Island had received a patent for the area in 1693, which had been disputed by Massachusetts Bay Colony. Rhode Island successfully defended the patent, and a royal decree in 1746 transferred the land to Rhode Island along the eastern shore of the Narragansett Bay, including the mainland portion of <a href="Newport%20County%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport County</a> and all of modern <a href="Bristol%20County%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Bristol County</a>, <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>. The border itself continued to be contested by Massachusetts, first as a colony and later as a <a href="U.S.%20state">state</a>, until as late as 1898, when the boundary was settled and ratified by both states.

For most of its history, the town was the primary administrative unit and political division of the colony. Plymouth Colony was not formally divided into counties until June 2, 1685, during the reorganization that led to the formation of the <a href="Dominion%20of%20New%20England">Dominion of New England</a>. Three counties were composed of the following towns.

<a href="Barnstable%20County%2C%20Massachusetts">Barnstable County</a> on Cape Cod:
<a href="Bristol%20County%2C%20Massachusetts">Bristol County</a> along the shores of <a href="Buzzards%20Bay">Buzzards Bay</a> and <a href="Narragansett%20Bay">Narragansett Bay</a>; part of this county was later ceded to Rhode Island:
<a href="Plymouth%20County%2C%20Massachusetts">Plymouth County</a>, located along the western shores of <a href="Cape%20Cod%20Bay">Cape Cod Bay</a>:

The settlers of Plymouth Colony fit broadly into three categories: "Pilgrims", "Strangers", and "Particulars". The Pilgrims were a Puritan group who closely followed the teachings of <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>, like the later founders of Massachusetts Bay Colony to the north. (The difference was that the Massachusetts Bay Puritans hoped to reform the Anglican church from within, whereas the Pilgrims saw it as a morally defunct organization and removed themselves from it.) The name "Pilgrims" was actually not used by the settlers themselves. William Bradford used the term word to describe the group, but he was using it generically to define them as travelers on a religious mission. The Pilgrims referred to themselves as the "Saints", "First Comers", "Ancient Brethren", or "Ancient Men". They used such terms to indicate their place as <a href="Election%20%28Christianity%29">God's elect</a>, as they subscribed to the Calvinist belief in <a href="predestination">predestination</a>. "The First Comers" was a term more loosely used in their day to refer to any of the Mayflower passengers. There were also a number of <a href="indentured%20servant">indentured servant</a>s among the colonists. Indentured servants were mostly poor children whose families were receiving church relief and "homeless waifs from the streets of London sent as laborers".

In addition to the Pilgrims, the "Mayflower" carried "Strangers", the non-Puritan settlers placed on the "Mayflower" by the Merchant Adventurers who provided various skills needed to establish a colony. This also included later settlers who came for other reasons throughout the history of the colony and who did not adhere to the Pilgrim religious ideals. A third group known as the "Particulars" consisted of later settlers who paid their own "particular" way to America, and thus were not obligated to pay the colony's debts.

The presence of outsiders such as the Strangers and the Particulars was a considerable annoyance to the Pilgrims. As early as 1623, a conflict broke out between the Pilgrims and the Strangers over the celebration of Christmas, a day of no particular significance to the Pilgrims. Furthermore, a group of Strangers founded the nearby settlement of <a href="Wessagussett">Wessagussett</a> and the Pilgrims were highly strained by their lack of discipline, both emotionally and in terms of resources. They looked at the eventual failure of the Wessagussett settlement as Divine Providence against a sinful people. The residents of Plymouth also used terms to distinguish between the earliest settlers of the colony and those who came later. The first generation of settlers called themselves the "Old Comers" or "Planters", those who arrived before 1627. Later generations of Plymouth residents referred to this group as the "Forefathers".

Historian <a href="John%20Putnam%20Demos">John Demos</a> did a demographic study in "A Little Commonwealth" (1970). He reports that the colony's average household grew from 7.8 children per family for first-generation families to 8.6 children for second-generation families and to 9.3 for third-generation families. Child mortality also decreased over this time, with 7.2 children born to first-generation families living until their 21st birthday. That number increased to 7.9 children by the third generation. Life expectancy was higher for men than for women. Of the men who survived until age 21, the average life expectancy was 69.2 years. Over 55 percent of these men lived past 70; less than 15 percent died before the age of 50. The numbers were much lower for women owing to the difficulties of childbearing. The average life expectancy of women at the age of 21 was 62.4 years. Of these women, fewer than 45 percent lived past 70, and about 30 percent died before the age of 50.

During <a href="King%20Philip%27s%20War">King Philip's War</a>, Plymouth Colony lost eight percent of its adult male population. By the end of the war, one-third of <a href="New%20England">New England</a>'s approximately 100 towns had been burned and abandoned, and this had a significant demographic effect on the population of New England.

The Native Americans in New England were organized into loose tribal confederations, sometimes called "nations". Among these confederations were the <a href="Nipmuck">Nipmuck</a>s, the <a href="Massachusett">Massachusett</a>, the <a href="Narragansett%20%28tribe%29">Narragansett</a>, the <a href="Niantic%20%28tribe%29">Niantics</a>, the <a href="Mohegan">Mohegan</a>, and the <a href="Wampanoag%20people">Wampanoag</a>. Several significant events dramatically altered the demographics of the Native American population in the region. The first was "Standish's raid" on Wessagussett, which frightened Native American leaders to the extent that many abandoned their settlements, resulting in many deaths through starvation and disease. The second, the <a href="Pequot%20War">Pequot War</a>, resulted in the dissolution of the Pequot tribe and a major shift in the local power structure. The third, <a href="King%20Philip%27s%20War">King Philip's War</a>, had the most dramatic effect on local populations, resulting in the death or displacement of as much as 80% of the "total" number of Native Americans of southern New England and the enslavement and removal of thousands of Native Americans to the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and other locales.

Some of the wealthier families in Plymouth Colony owned black slaves which were considered the property of their owners, unlike <a href="indentured%20servants">indentured servants</a>, and passed on to heirs like any other property. Slave ownership was not widespread and very few families possessed the wealth necessary to own slaves. In 1674, the inventory of Capt. Thomas Willet of Marshfield includes "8 Negroes" at a value of £200. Other inventories of the time also valued slaves at £24–25 each (equivalent to £ in 2010, or $ at <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">PPP</a>), well out of the financial ability of most families. A 1689 census of the town of Bristol shows that, of the 70 families that lived there, only one had a black slave. So few were black slaves in the colony that the General Court never saw fit to pass any laws dealing with them.

The largest source of wealth for Plymouth Colony was the <a href="North%20American%20fur%20trade">fur trade</a>. The disruption of this trade caused by Myles Standish's raid at Wessagussett created great hardship for the colonists for many years to come, and was directly cited by William Bradford as a contributing factor to the colonists' economic difficulties in their early years. The colonists attempted to supplement their income by <a href="History%20of%20fishing">fishing</a>; the waters in Cape Cod bay were known to be excellent fisheries. However, they lacked any skill in this area, and it did little to relieve their economic hardship. The colony traded throughout the region, establishing trading posts as far away as <a href="Penobscot%2C%20Maine">Penobscot, Maine</a>. They were also frequent trading partners with the Dutch at <a href="New%20Amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a>.

The economic situation improved with the arrival of cattle in the colony. It is unknown when the first cattle arrived, but the division of land for the grazing of cattle in 1627 represented one of the first moves towards private land ownership in the colony. Cattle became an important source of wealth in the colony; the average cow could sell for £28 in 1638 (£ in 2010, or $ at <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">PPP</a>). However, the flood of immigrants during the Great Migration drove the price of cattle down. The same cows sold at £28 in 1638 were valued in 1640 at only £5 (£ in 2010, or $ at <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">PPP</a>). Besides cattle, there were also pigs, sheep, and goats raised in the colony.

<a href="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> also made up an important part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Native American agricultural practices and crops. They planted <a href="maize">maize</a>, <a href="Cucurbita">squash</a>, <a href="pumpkin">pumpkin</a>s, <a href="bean">bean</a>s, and <a href="potato">potato</a>es. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper <a href="crop%20rotation">crop rotation</a> and the use of dead fish to fertilize the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as <a href="turnip">turnip</a>s, <a href="carrot">carrot</a>s, <a href="pea">pea</a>s, <a href="wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="barley">barley</a>, and <a href="oat">oat</a>s.

Overall, there was very little cash in Plymouth Colony, so most wealth was accumulated in the form of possessions. Trade goods such as furs, fish, and livestock were subject to fluctuations in price and were unreliable repositories of wealth. Durable goods such as fine wares, clothes, and furnishings represented an important source of economic stability for the residents.

The events surrounding the founding and history of Plymouth Colony have had a lasting effect on the art, traditions, mythology, and politics of the United States of America, despite its short history of fewer than 72 years.

The earliest artistic depiction of the Pilgrims was actually done before their arrival in America; Dutch painter <a href="Adam%20Willaerts">Adam Willaerts</a> painted a portrait of their departure from <a href="Delfshaven">Delfshaven</a> in 1620. The same scene was repainted by <a href="Robert%20W.%20Weir">Robert Walter Weir</a> in 1844, and hangs in the Rotunda of the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a> building. Numerous other paintings have been created memorializing various scenes from the life of Plymouth Colony, including their landing and the "First Thanksgiving", many of which have been collected by <a href="Pilgrim%20Hall">Pilgrim Hall</a>, a museum and historical society founded in 1824 to preserve the history of the Colony.

Several contemporaneous accounts of life in Plymouth Colony have become both vital primary historical documents and literary classics. "<a href="Of%20Plymouth%20Plantation">Of Plimoth Plantation</a>" by William Bradford and "<a href="Mourt%27s%20Relation">Mourt's Relation</a>" by Bradford, Edward Winslow, and others are both accounts written by "Mayflower" passengers that provide much of the information which we have today regarding the trans-Atlantic voyage and early years of the settlement.

Benjamin Church wrote several accounts of King Philip's War, including "Entertaining Passages Relating to Philip's War", which remained popular throughout the 18th century. An edition of the work was illustrated by <a href="Paul%20Revere">Paul Revere</a> in 1772. "The Sovereignty and Goodness of God" provides an account of King Philip's War from the perspective of <a href="Mary%20Rowlandson">Mary Rowlandson</a>, an Englishwoman who was captured and spent some time in the company of Native Americans during the war. Later works, such as "<a href="The%20Courtship%20of%20Miles%20Standish">The Courtship of Miles Standish</a>" by <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>, have provided a romantic and partially fictionalized account of life in Plymouth Colony.

There are also numerous films about the Pilgrims, including the several <a href="film%20adaptations">film adaptations</a> of ""<a href="The%20Courtship%20of%20Miles%20Standish%20%281923%20film%29">The Courtship of Miles Standish</a>""; the 1952 film "<a href="Plymouth%20Adventure">Plymouth Adventure</a>" starring <a href="Spencer%20Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>; and "Desperate Crossings: The True Story of the Mayflower", a 2006 television documentary produced by the <a href="History%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">History Channel</a>.

In 1970, the United States Postal Service issued a three hundred and fiftieth-year commemorative stamp recognizing the <a href="English%20dissenters">English dissenters</a> first landing at the modern day settlement of <a href="Provincetown%2C%20Massachusetts">Provincetown, Massachusetts</a> in 1620.

Each year, the United States celebrates a holiday known as Thanksgiving on the fourth Thursday of November. It is a <a href="Federal%20holidays%20in%20the%20United%20States">federal holiday</a> and frequently involves a family gathering with a large feast, traditionally featuring a <a href="Turkey%20%28bird%29">turkey</a>. Civic recognitions of the holiday typically include parades and <a href="American%20football">football</a> games. The holiday is meant to honor the First Thanksgiving, which was a harvest feast held in Plymouth in 1621, as first recorded in the book "New England's Memorial" by <a href="Nathaniel%20Morton">Nathaniel Morton</a>, secretary of Plymouth Colony and nephew of Governor William Bradford.

The annual Thanksgiving holiday is a fairly recent creation. Throughout the early 19th century, the U.S. government had declared a particular day as a national day of Thanksgiving, but these were one-time declarations meant to celebrate a significant event, such as victory in a battle. The northeastern states began adopting an annual day of Thanksgiving in November shortly after the end of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. <a href="Sarah%20Josepha%20Hale">Sarah Josepha Hale</a>, editor of Boston's "<a href="Ladies%27%20Magazine">Ladies' Magazine</a>", wrote editorials beginning in 1827 which called for the nationwide expansion of this annual day of thanksgiving to commemorate the Pilgrim's first harvest feast. After nearly 40 years, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> declared the first modern Thanksgiving to fall on the last Thursday in November in 1863. <a href="Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> ultimately moved it to the fourth Thursday in November. After some sparring as to the date, the holiday was recognized by <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> as an official federal holiday in 1941.

Some of the modern traditions which have developed alongside the Thanksgiving holiday are the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>'s <a href="NFL%20on%20Thanksgiving%20Day">Thanksgiving Day games</a> and the annual <a href="Macy%27s%20Thanksgiving%20Day%20Parade">Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>.

One of the enduring symbols of the landing of the Pilgrims is Plymouth Rock, a large <a href="granodiorite">granodiorite</a> boulder that was near their landing site at Plymouth. However, none of the contemporary accounts of the actual landing makes any mention that the Rock was the specific place of landing. The Pilgrims chose the site for their landing not for the rock, but for a small brook nearby that was a source of fresh water and fish.

The first identification of Plymouth Rock as the actual landing site was in 1741 by 90-year-old Thomas Faunce, whose father had arrived in Plymouth in 1623, three years after the supposed event. The rock was later covered by a solid-fill pier. In 1774, an attempt was made to excavate the rock, but it broke in two. The severed piece was placed in the Town Square at the center of Plymouth. In 1880, the intact half of the rock was excavated from the pier, and the broken piece was reattached to it. Over the years, souvenir hunters have removed chunks from the rock, but the remains are now protected as part of the complex of <a href="living%20history">living museums</a>. These include the "<a href="Mayflower%20II">Mayflower II</a>", a recreation of the original ship; <a href="Plimoth%20Plantation">Plimoth Plantation</a>, a historical recreation of the original 1620 settlement; and the Wampanoag Homesite, which recreates a 17th-century Indian village.

The democratic setup of Plymouth Colony had a strong influence on shaping democracy in both England and America. William Bradford's "History of Plimoth Plantation" was widely read in the motherland. It influenced the political thought of Puritan politician and poet <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>, assistant to <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>, and philosopher <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>. For example, Locke referred to the Mayflower Compact in his "Letters Concerning Toleration". In America, Plymouth Colony initiated a democratic tradition that was followed by <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> (1628), <a href="Connecticut%20Colony">Connecticut Colony</a> (1636), the <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</a> (1636), the <a href="Province%20of%20New%20Jersey">Province of New Jersey</a>, and <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> (1681). <a href="Roger%20Williams">Roger Williams</a> established <a href="Providence%20Plantations">Providence Plantations</a> specifically as a safe haven for those who experienced religious persecution, thereby adding freedom of conscience to Plymouth's democratic model.

The General Society of Mayflower Descendants, or The Mayflower Society, is a <a href="List%20of%20hereditary%20%26amp%3B%20lineage%20organizations">genealogical organization</a> of individuals who have documented their descent from one or more of the 102 passengers who arrived on the "Mayflower" in 1620. The Society, founded at Plymouth in 1897, claims that tens of millions of Americans are descended from these passengers, and it offers research services for people seeking to document their descent.

Northern pintail

The pintail or northern pintail ("Anas acuta") is a <a href="duck">duck</a> with wide geographic <a href="Range%20%28biology%29">distribution</a> that breeds in the northern areas of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. It is <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> and winters south of its <a href="breeding%20range">breeding range</a> to the <a href="equator">equator</a>. Unusually for a bird with such a large range, it has no geographical <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> if the possibly <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a> duck <a href="Eaton%27s%20pintail">Eaton's pintail</a> is considered to be a separate species.

This is a large duck, and the male's long central tail feathers give rise to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running from the back of its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female <a href="dabbling%20duck">dabbling duck</a>s. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.

The northern pintail is a bird of open <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s which nests on the ground, often some distance from water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s to its diet during the <a href="nesting%20season">nesting season</a>. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, have also had a significant impact on numbers. Nevertheless, owing to the huge range and large population of this species, it is not threatened globally.

This species was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "Systema naturae" in 1758 as "Anas acuta". The scientific name comes from two <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words: "anas", meaning "duck", and "acuta", which comes from the verb "acuere", "to sharpen"; the species term, like the <a href="English%20language">English</a> name, refers to the pointed tail of the male in breeding plumage. 
Within the large <a href="Anatinae">dabbling duck</a> genus "Anas", the northern pintail's closest relatives are other pintails, such as the <a href="yellow-billed%20pintail">yellow-billed pintail</a> ("A. georgica") and <a href="Eaton%27s%20pintail">Eaton's pintail</a> ("A. eatoni"). The pintails are sometimes separated in the genus "Dafila" (described by <a href="James%20Francis%20Stephens">Stephens</a>, 1824), an arrangement supported by morphological, molecular and behavioural data. The famous <a href="Great%20Britain">British</a> <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> Sir <a href="Peter%20Scott">Peter Scott</a> gave this name to his daughter, the artist Dafila Scott.

Eaton's pintail has two subspecies, "A. e. eatoni" (the Kerguelen pintail) of <a href="Kerguelen%20Islands">Kerguelen Islands</a>, and "A. e. drygalskyi" (the Crozet pintail) of <a href="Crozet%20Islands">Crozet Islands</a>, and was formerly considered conspecific with the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">northern hemisphere's</a> northern pintail. <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">Sexual dimorphism</a> is much less marked in the southern pintails, with the male's breeding appearance being similar to the female plumage. Unusually for a species with such a large range, northern pintail has no geographical subspecies if Eaton's pintail is treated as a separate species. A claimed extinct subspecies from <a href="Manra%20Island">Manra Island</a>, Tristram's pintail, "A. a. modesta", appears to be indistinguishable from the nominate form.

The northern pintail is a fairly large duck with a <a href="Wing%20chord%20%28biology%29">wing chord</a> of and wingspan of . The male is in length and weighs , and therefore is considerably larger than the female, which is long and weighs . The northern pintail broadly overlaps in size with the similarly-widespread <a href="mallard">mallard</a>, but is more slender, elongated and gracile, with a relatively longer neck and (in males) a longer tail. The unmistakable breeding <a href="plumage">plumage</a>d male has a chocolate-brown head and white breast with a white stripe extending up the side of the neck. Its upperparts and sides are grey, but elongated grey feathers with black central stripes are draped across the back from the shoulder area. The vent area is yellow, contrasting with the black underside of the tail, which has the central feathers elongated to as much as . The bill is bluish and the legs are blue-grey.

The adult female is mainly scalloped and mottled in light brown with a more uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown <a href="speculum%20feathers">speculum</a> with a narrower trailing edge.

The pintail walks well on land, and swims well. It has a very fast flight, with its wings slightly swept-back, rather than straight out from the body like other ducks. In flight, the male shows a black speculum bordered white at the rear and pale rufous at the front, whereas the female's speculum is dark brown bordered with white, narrowly at the front edge but very prominently at the rear, being visible at a distance of .

The male's call is a soft "proop-proop" whistle, similar to that of the <a href="common%20teal">common teal</a>, whereas the female has a <a href="mallard">mallard</a>-like descending quack, and a low croak when flushed.

This <a href="dabbling%20duck">dabbling duck</a> breeds across northern areas of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> south to about <a href="Poland">Poland</a> and <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, and in <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a>. Mainly in winters south of its breeding range, reaches almost to the equator in <a href="Panama">Panama</a>, northern <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> and tropical <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>. Small numbers migrate to <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a> islands, particularly <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, where a few hundred birds winter on the main islands in shallow <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s and flooded agricultural habitats. <a href="Ocean">Transoceanic</a> journeys also occur: a bird that was caught and <a href="bird%20ringing">ringed</a> in <a href="Labrador">Labrador</a>, Canada, was shot by a hunter in England nine days later, and <a href="Japan">Japanese-ringed</a> birds have been recovered from six US states east to <a href="Utah">Utah</a> and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. In parts of the range, such as <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and the northwestern United States, the pintail may be present all year.

The northern pintail's breeding habitat is open unwooded wetlands, such as wet grassland, lakesides or tundra. In winter, it will utilise a wider range of open habitats, such as sheltered estuaries, brackish marshes and coastal lagoons. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms very large mixed flocks with other ducks.

Both sexes reach sexual maturity at one year of age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there is a group of males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers on the back of her head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.

Breeding takes place between April and June, with the nest being constructed on the ground and hidden amongst vegetation in a dry location, often some distance from water. It is a shallow scrape on the ground lined with plant material and down. The female lays seven to nine cream-coloured eggs at the rate of one per day; the eggs are in size and weigh , of which 7% is shell. If predators destroy the first clutch, the female can produce a replacement clutch as late as the end of July.
The hen alone incubates the eggs for 22 to 24 days before they hatch. The <a href="precocial">precocial</a> downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the water surface. The chicks fledge in 46 to 47 days after hatching, but stay with the female until she has completed <a href="moult">moult</a>ing.

Around three-quarters of chicks live long enough to fledge, but not more than half of those survive long enough to reproduce. The maximum recorded age is 27 years and 5 months for a <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> bird.

The pintail feeds by dabbling and upending in shallow water for plant food mainly in the evening or at night, and therefore spends much of the day resting. Its long neck enables it to take food items from the bottom of water bodies up to deep, which are beyond the reach of other dabbling ducks like the Mallard.

The winter diet is mainly plant material including seeds and <a href="rhizome">rhizome</a>s of aquatic plants, but the pintail sometimes feeds on roots, grain and other seeds in fields, though less frequently than other "Anas" ducks. During the nesting season, this bird eats mainly <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> animals, including aquatic <a href="insect">insect</a>s, <a href="Mollusca">mollusc</a>s and <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s.

Pintail nests and chicks are vulnerable to predation by mammals, such as <a href="fox">fox</a>es and <a href="badger">badger</a>s, and birds like <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="crow">crow</a>s and <a href="magpie">magpie</a>s. The adults can take flight to escape terrestrial predators, but nesting females in particular may be surprised by large <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>s such as <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s. Large <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, such as <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>s, will take ducks from the ground, and some <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s, including the <a href="gyrfalcon">gyrfalcon</a>, have the speed and power to catch flying birds.

It is susceptible to a range of <a href="Parasitism">parasites</a> including "<a href="Cryptosporidium">Cryptosporidium</a>", "<a href="Giardia%20lamblia">Giardia</a>", <a href="Cestoda">tapeworms</a>, blood parasites and external feather lice, and is also affected by other avian diseases. It is often the dominant species in major mortality events from avian <a href="botulism">botulism</a> and avian <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, and can also contract <a href="avian%20influenza">avian influenza</a>, the <a href="Influenza%20A%20virus%20subtype%20H5N1">H5N1</a> strain of which is highly pathogenic and occasionally infects humans.

The northern pintail is a popular species for game shooting because of its speed, agility, and excellent eating qualities, and is hunted across its range. Although one of the world's most numerous ducks, the combination of hunting with other factors has led to population declines, and local restrictions on hunting have been introduced at times to help conserve numbers.

This species' preferred habitat of shallow water is naturally susceptible to problems such as drought or the encroachment of vegetation, but this duck's habitat might be increasingly threatened by climate change. Populations are also affected by the conversion of wetlands and grassland to arable crops, depriving the duck of feeding and nesting areas. Spring planting means that many nests of this early breeding duck are destroyed by farming activities, and a Canadian study showed that more than half of the surveyed nests were destroyed by agricultural work such as ploughing and <a href="harrow%20%28tool%29">harrowing</a>.

Hunting with lead shot, along with the use of lead sinkers in <a href="angling">angling</a>, has been identified as a major cause of <a href="lead%20poisoning">lead poisoning</a> in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> study showed that northern pintail and <a href="common%20pochard">common pochard</a> were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for <a href="waterfowl">waterfowl</a> must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any <a href="lead">lead</a>.

The northern pintail has a large range, estimated at , and a population estimated at 5.3–5.4 million individuals. It is therefore not believed to meet the IUCN Red List threshold criterion of a population decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations, and is evaluated as of Least Concern.

In the <a href="Palearctic%20ecozone">Palaearctic</a>, breeding populations are declining in much of the range, including its stronghold in Russia. In other regions, populations are stable or fluctuating.

Pintails in North America at least have been badly affected by avian diseases, with the breeding population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5 million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.

The northern pintail is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (<a href="AEWA">AEWA</a>) applies, but it has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<a href="CITES">CITES</a>), which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants.

Angel of Death (Slayer song)

"Angel of Death" is the opening track on the American <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> band <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a>'s 1986 album "<a href="Reign%20in%20Blood">Reign in Blood</a>". The lyrics and music were written by guitarist <a href="Jeff%20Hanneman">Jeff Hanneman</a>. They detail the <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> physician <a href="Josef%20Mengele">Josef Mengele</a>'s <a href="Nazi%20human%20experimentation">human experiments</a> at the <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. 

Although the lyrics describe Mengele's abuses rather than endorsing them, "Angel of Death" led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing and <a href="racism">racism</a> against the band, which they vigorously denied but which followed them throughout their early career. Despite the controversy and the resulting delay in the release of "Reign in Blood", the song remains a live favorite, and has appeared on all of Slayer's <a href="live%20album">live album</a>s.

The song has been described as highly influential in the development of thrash metal or <a href="speed%20metal">speed metal</a>, and is highly regarded by some critics; <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Steve Huey called it a classic and the album "the pinnacle of speed metal". The <a href="Half-time_%28music%29%23Half-time">half-time</a> riff was sampled by <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28band%29">Public Enemy</a> in their 1988 song "<a href="It%20Takes%20a%20Nation%20of%20Millions%20to%20Hold%20Us%20Back">She Watch Channel Zero?!</a>."

Slayer guitarist <a href="Jeff%20Hanneman">Jeff Hanneman</a> wrote "Angel of Death" after reading books about <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> physician <a href="Josef%20Mengele">Josef Mengele</a> while on tour with the band. He said that he remembered "stopping someplace where I bought two books on Mengele. I thought, 'This has gotta be some sick shit.' So when it came time to do the record, that stuff was still in my head—that's where the lyrics to 'Angel of Death' came from." 

The lyrics are written both from Mengele's point of view and from that of a detached observer condemning his actions. They detail Mengele's surgical experiments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. Mengele's explorations were conducted on such groups as <a href="Dwarfism">dwarfs</a> and <a href="twins">twins</a>, and included both physical and psychological examinations. Among the tests he performed that are mentioned in "Angel of Death" are experimental surgeries performed without <a href="anesthesia">anesthesia</a>, <a href="transfusions">transfusion</a> of blood between twins, <a href="Solitary%20confinement">isolation</a> endurance, <a href="Chemical%20warfare">gassing</a>, injections with lethal <a href="microorganism">germs</a>, <a href="sex%20change%20operation">sex change operation</a>s, the removal of <a href="organ%20%28anatomy%29">organ</a>s and <a href="Limb%20%28anatomy%29">limbs</a>, and <a href="abacination">abacination</a>.

The lyrics of "Angel of Death" delayed the release of "<a href="Reign%20in%20Blood">Reign in Blood</a>". The band were signed to <a href="Def%20Jam%20Records">Def Jam Records</a>, whose distributor, <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>, refused to release the album due to its subject matter and artwork, which they believed were "too graphic". "Reign in Blood" was eventually distributed by <a href="Geffen%20Records">Geffen Records</a> on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, "Reign in Blood" did not appear on Geffen Records' official release schedule.

"Angel of Death" caused outrage among <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a> survivors, as well as their families and the general public. The controversy led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals, his most prized item being a German <a href="Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross">Knight's Cross</a>, as evidence of sympathizing. Hanneman objected, stating: According to guitarist <a href="Kerry%20King">Kerry King</a>: "Yeah, 'Slayer are Nazis, fascists, Communists'—all that fun shit. And of course we got the most flak for it in Germany. I was always like, 'Read the lyrics and tell me what's offensive about it. Can you see it as a documentary, or do you think Slayer's preaching fucking World War II?' People get this thought in their heads—especially in Europe—and you'll never talk them out of it."
The song drew accusations of racism, which the band has denied. The band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews, and have stated numerous times that they do not condone racism and are merely interested in the subject.
Hanneman also wrote "SS-3", a song about senior <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> commander <a href="Reinhard%20Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a>, which appeared on the band's 1994 album "<a href="Divine%20Intervention%20%28album%29">Divine Intervention</a>". The song "<a href="Jihad%20%28song%29">Jihad</a>" from their 2006 album "<a href="Christ%20Illusion">Christ Illusion</a>" has drawn comparison to "Angel of Death". "Jihad" deals with the <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%2C%20attacks">September 11, 2001, attacks</a>, and is told from a <a href="terrorist">terrorist</a>'s perspective. Araya expected the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of "Angel of Death", although it did not materialise, in part, he believes, due to people's view that the song is "just Slayer being Slayer".

At 4 minutes and 51 seconds, "Angel of Death" is the longest track on the album, which is 29 minutes in total. It is one of the most <a href="song%20structure">structurally</a> conventional songs on the album, featuring prominent <a href="Verse%E2%80%93chorus%20form">verses and choruses</a>, which most of the songs eschew. Araya's vocal performance begins with a piercing, wordless scream. "[G]uitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs [and] drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded" at 210 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>.

When drummer Lombardo left Slayer in 1992, they recruited a full-time replacement in <a href="Forbidden%20%28band%29">Forbidden</a> drummer <a href="Paul%20Bostaph">Paul Bostaph</a>. Bostaph made one mistake out of the nine songs the band trialled him with, on "Angel of Death". Before the "big double bass part" there is a lead section, which Bostaph could not understand, as he had to learn from live records recorded with Lombardo. Bostaph could not tell how many revolutions the guitar riff goes before the bass sequence. The band members told him there were eight, "perfecting" the song afterwards.

Although "Angel of Death" did not chart, it was highly praised by critics reviewing "Reign in Blood". Clay Jarvas of "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>" observed how the song "smokes the asses of any band playing fast and/or heavy today. Lyrically outlining the horrors to come, while musically laying the groundwork for the rest of the record: fast, lean and filthy." Adrien Begrand of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" remarked that "There's no better song to kick things off than the masterful 'Angel of Death', one of the most monumental songs in metal history."

Derek Jeter

Derek Sanderson Jeter ( ; born June 26, 1974) is an American former professional <a href="baseball">baseball</a> <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a>, businessman, and baseball executive. He has been the <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">chief executive officer</a> (CEO) and part owner of the <a href="Miami%20Marlins">Miami Marlins</a> of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) since September 2017.

As a shortstop, Jeter spent his entire 20-year MLB playing career with the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. A five-time <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> champion, Jeter is regarded as one of the primary contributors to the Yankees' success of the late 1990s and early 2000s for his hitting, baserunning, fielding, and leadership. He is the Yankees' all-time career leader in <a href="Hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a> (3,465), <a href="Double%20%28baseball%29">doubles</a> (544), games played (2,747), <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a>s (358), <a href="times%20on%20base">times on base</a> (4,716), <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a>s (12,602) and <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>s (11,195). His accolades include 14 <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> selections, five <a href="Rawlings%20Gold%20Glove%20Award">Gold Glove Awards</a>, five <a href="Silver%20Slugger%20Award">Silver Slugger Award</a>s, two <a href="Hank%20Aaron%20Award">Hank Aaron Award</a>s, and a <a href="Roberto%20Clemente%20Award">Roberto Clemente Award</a>. Jeter was the 28th player to reach <a href="3%2C000%20hit%20club">3,000 hits</a> and finished his career ranked sixth in MLB history in career hits and first among shortstops. In 2017, the Yankees <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20retired%20numbers">retired</a> his uniform number 2.

The Yankees drafted Jeter out of high school in <a href="1992%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">1992</a>, and he debuted in the major leagues at age 21 in 1995. The following year, he became the Yankees' starting shortstop, won the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Rookie of the Year Award</a>, and helped push the team to win the <a href="1996%20World%20Series">1996 World Series</a>. Jeter continued to play during the team's championship seasons of 1998–2000; he finished third in voting for the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award</a> in 1998, recorded multiple career-high numbers in 1999, and won both the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">All-Star Game MVP</a> and <a href="World%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">World Series MVP Awards</a> in 2000. He consistently placed among the AL leaders in hits and runs scored for most of his career, and served as the Yankees' <a href="captain%20%28baseball%29">team captain</a> from 2003 until his retirement in 2014. Throughout his career, Jeter contributed reliably to the Yankees' franchise successes. He holds many <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason">postseason</a> records, and has a .321 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> in the World Series. Jeter earned the nicknames of "Captain Clutch" and "Mr. November" due to his outstanding play in the postseason.

Jeter was one of the most heavily marketed athletes of his generation and is involved in numerous product endorsements. As a celebrity, his personal life and relationships with other celebrities has drawn the attention of the media.

Derek Sanderson Jeter was born on June 26, 1974 in <a href="Pequannock%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Pequannock Township, New Jersey</a>, the son of accountant Dorothy (née Connors) and substance abuse counselor Sanderson Charles Jeter. His mother is of <a href="English%20people">English</a>, <a href="Germans">German</a>, and <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> ancestry, while his father is <a href="African%20Americans">African-American</a>. They met while serving in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> in Germany. His father played baseball at <a href="Fisk%20University">Fisk University</a> in Tennessee as a <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a>, and holds a PhD. When Jeter was a child, his parents made him sign a contract every year that defined acceptable and unacceptable forms of behavior. Dorothy instilled a positive attitude in her son, insisting that he not use the word "can't". It was a baseball family, and Jeter's younger sister Sharlee (born 1979) was a <a href="softball">softball</a> star in high school.

The Jeters lived in New Jersey until Derek was four years old, at which point they moved to <a href="Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan">Kalamazoo, Michigan</a>. At the age of five Jeter began playing little league baseball. The children lived with their parents during the school year and spent their summers with their grandparents in New Jersey. Attending <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> games with his grandparents, Jeter became a passionate fan of the team. Watching star outfielder <a href="Dave%20Winfield">Dave Winfield</a> inspired him to pursue a career in baseball.

Jeter attended <a href="Kalamazoo%20Central%20High%20School">Kalamazoo Central High School</a>, where he ran <a href="Cross%20country%20running">cross country</a> in the fall, played <a href="basketball">basketball</a> in the winter and baseball in the spring. Jeter posted high <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>s for the school's baseball team; he batted .557 in his <a href="Tenth%20grade">somophore year</a> and .508 as a <a href="Eleventh%20grade">junior</a>. In his <a href="Twelfth%20grade">senior year</a>, he batted .508 and compiled 23 <a href="Run%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> (RBIs), 21 <a href="Base%20on%20balls">walks</a>, four <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s, a .637 <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a> (OBP), a .831 <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> (SLG), 12 <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a>s (in 12 attempts), and only one <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a>.

Jeter received several honors after his senior season. These included an All-State honorable mention, distinguishing him as one of the best high school baseball players in Michigan, the Kalamazoo Area <a href="B%27nai%20B%27rith">B'nai B'rith</a> Award for Scholar Athlete, the 1992 High School Player of the Year Award from the <a href="American%20Baseball%20Coaches%20Association">American Baseball Coaches Association</a>, the 1992 <a href="Gatorade">Gatorade</a> High School <a href="Player%20of%20the%20year%20award">Player of the year award</a>, and "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"s High School Player of the Year. Kalamazoo Central High School inducted Jeter into its Athletic Hall of Fame in 2003 and renamed its baseball field in his honor in 2011. Jeter earned a baseball <a href="scholarship">scholarship</a> to attend the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> and play <a href="college%20baseball">college baseball</a> for the <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20baseball">Michigan Wolverines</a>.

The <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a> held the first overall pick in the <a href="1992%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">1992 MLB draft</a>. <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> pitcher <a href="Hal%20Newhouser">Hal Newhouser</a>, who worked for the Astros as a <a href="scout%20%28sport%29">scout</a>, evaluated Jeter extensively and lobbied team management to select him. Fearing Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1 million to forgo college for a professional contract, they chose <a href="California%20State%20University%2C%20Fullerton">Cal State Fullerton</a> <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> <a href="Phil%20Nevin">Phil Nevin</a>, who signed for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.

The Yankees, who selected sixth, also rated Jeter highly. Yankees scout Dick Groch, assigned to scout in the <a href="Midwest">Midwest</a>, watched Jeter participate in an all-star camp held at <a href="Western%20Michigan%20University">Western Michigan University</a>. Though Yankees officials were concerned that Jeter would attend college instead of signing a professional contract, Groch convinced them to select him, saying, "the only place Derek Jeter's going is to <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Cooperstown</a>". The second through fifth picks were <a href="Paul%20Shuey">Paul Shuey</a>, <a href="B.%20J.%20Wallace">B. J. Wallace</a>, <a href="Jeffrey%20Hammonds">Jeffrey Hammonds</a>, and <a href="Chad%20Mottola">Chad Mottola</a>; those five would combine for two All-Star Game appearances (Nevin and Hammonds). The Yankees drafted Jeter, who chose to turn pro, signing for $800,000.

Jeter played four seasons in <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor league baseball</a>, then known as the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL). Jeter began the <a href="1992%20in%20baseball">1992 season</a> with the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20League%20Yankees">Gulf Coast Yankees</a> of the <a href="Rookie-level">Rookie</a>-level <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20League">Gulf Coast League</a>, based in <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>. In his first professional game, Jeter failed to get a hit in seven at-bats, going <a href="O-fer">0-for-7</a>, while striking out five times. Jeter continued to struggle during the rest of the season, batting .202 in 47 games. Manager <a href="Gary%20Denbo">Gary Denbo</a> benched Jeter in the season's final game to ensure his average would not drop below .200, known in baseball as the <a href="Mendoza%20Line">Mendoza Line</a>. Frustrated by his lack of success and homesick, Jeter accrued $400-per-month phone bills from daily calls to his parents.

The Yankees promoted Jeter to the <a href="Greensboro%20Grasshoppers">Greensboro Hornets</a> of the <a href="Class%20A%20%28baseball%29">Class A</a> <a href="South%20Atlantic%20League">South Atlantic League</a> (SAL) to give him more at-bats. He batted .247 in his first 11 games with Greensboro, and struggled defensively, making nine <a href="error%20%28baseball%29">errors</a> in 48 <a href="fielding%20chance">chances</a>. Weighing , Jeter had a scrawny appearance that did not match his reputation as the Yankees' future leader. <a href="Jorge%20Posada">Jorge Posada</a> and <a href="Andy%20Pettitte">Andy Pettitte</a>, who played for the Hornets that season, at first questioned the hype surrounding Jeter, but recognized his talent and poise.

Jeter focused the next offseason on his fielding. "<a href="Baseball%20America">Baseball America</a>" rated Jeter among the top 100 prospects in baseball before the <a href="1993%20in%20baseball">1993 season</a>, ranking him 44th. Returning to the Hornets in 1993, his first full season of professional baseball, Jeter hit .295 with five home runs, 71 RBIs, and 18 stolen bases; SAL managers voted him the "Most Outstanding Major League Prospect" in the league. He finished second in the SAL in <a href="triple%20%28baseball%29">triples</a> (11), third in hits (152), and eleventh in batting average, and was named to the postseason All-Star team. Jeter committed 56 errors, a SAL record. Despite this, he was named the SAL's Best Defensive Shortstop, Most Exciting Player, and Best Infield Arm by "Baseball America".

Coming off his strong 1993 season, "Baseball America" rated Jeter as the 16th-best prospect in baseball. Jeter played for the <a href="Tampa%20Tarpons">Tampa Yankees</a> of the <a href="Class%20A-Advanced">Class A-Advanced</a> <a href="Florida%20State%20League">Florida State League</a> (FSL), the <a href="Richmond%20Flying%20Squirrels">Albany-Colonie Yankees</a> of the <a href="Class%20AA">Class AA</a> <a href="Eastern%20League%20%28baseball%29">Eastern League</a>, and the <a href="Columbus%20Clippers">Columbus Clippers</a> of the <a href="Triple-A%20%28baseball%29">Class AAA</a> <a href="International%20League">International League</a> during the <a href="1994%20in%20baseball">1994 season</a>, combining to hit .344 with five home runs, 68 RBIs, and steal 50 bases across the three levels. He was honored with the <a href="Baseball%20America%20Minor%20League%20Player%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Minor League Player of the Year Award</a> by "<a href="Baseball%20America">Baseball America</a>", "<a href="The%20Sporting%20News">The Sporting News</a>", "<a href="USA%20Today%20Minor%20League%20Player%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">USA Today</a>", and <a href="Topps">Topps</a>/NAPBL. He was also named the most valuable player of the FSL.

Considered the fourth-best prospect in baseball by "Baseball America" heading into the <a href="1995%20in%20baseball">1995 season</a>, Jeter was projected as the starting shortstop for the Yankees. However, he suffered mild <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> in his right shoulder in the <a href="Arizona%20Fall%20League">Arizona Fall League</a> after the conclusion of the 1994 regular season. As a precaution, the Yankees signed <a href="Tony%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Tony Fernández</a> to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to Class AAA. During the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">1994–95 Major League Baseball strike</a>, <a href="Gene%20Michael">Gene Michael</a>, the Yankees' <a href="General%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a>, offered Jeter the opportunity to work out for the MLB team with <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20replacement%20players">replacement players</a> in <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> before the 1995 season. Jeter denied receiving the offer, and he did not <a href="strikebreaker">cross the picket line</a>.

Early in the <a href="1995%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1995 season</a>, Fernández and <a href="infielder">infielder</a> <a href="Pat%20Kelly%20%28infielder%29">Pat Kelly</a> were injured. Consequently, Jeter made his MLB debut on May 29, 1995. He was assigned <a href="Uniform%20number%20%28Major%20League%20Baseball%29">uniform number</a> 2, which was most recently worn by <a href="Mike%20Gallego">Mike Gallego</a> from 1992 to 1994. <a href="Batting%20order%20%28baseball%29">Batting ninth</a>, he went hitless in five <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>s, striking out once. The following day, he recorded his first two major league hits and scored his first two career runs. Jeter batted .250 and committed two errors in 13 games before being demoted to Class AAA Columbus; Fernández replaced Jeter at shortstop. The Yankees advanced to the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason">postseason</a> in 1995. Jeter traveled with the team during the <a href="1995%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">1995 American League Division Series</a> (ALDS), though he was not on the active roster. The Yankees lost to the <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a>.
After Fernández batted a disappointing .245 and appeared in only 108 games due to injuries in 1995, newly hired <a href="List%20of%20New%20York%20Yankees%20managers">Yankees manager</a> <a href="Joe%20Torre">Joe Torre</a> turned to Jeter for the <a href="1996%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1996 season</a>, hoping for a .250 batting average and dependable defense. <a href="List%20of%20New%20York%20Yankees%20owners%20and%20executives">Yankees owner</a> <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a>, often skeptical of younger players, was unconvinced. After <a href="Clyde%20King">Clyde King</a>, a close Steinbrenner advisor, observed Jeter for two days in spring training in 1996, he came away with the impression that Jeter was not yet ready to contribute at the major league level. To provide depth to the team at the shortstop position after an injury to Fernández, Steinbrenner approved a trade that would have sent pitcher <a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a> to the Mariners for shortstop <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Ferm%C3%ADn">Félix Fermín</a>, but Michael, by then the vice president of scouting, and assistant general manager <a href="Brian%20Cashman">Brian Cashman</a> convinced Steinbrenner to give Jeter an opportunity.

Rated the sixth-best prospect in baseball by "Baseball America" heading into the 1996 season, Jeter started on <a href="Opening%20Day">Opening Day</a>, the first Yankee <a href="rookie">rookie</a> to start as shortstop for the team since <a href="Tom%20Tresh">Tom Tresh</a> in 1962. He hit his first MLB home run that day. With his speed and ability to execute the <a href="hit-and-run%20%28baseball%29">hit and run</a>, Jeter served as a complement to <a href="leadoff%20hitter">leadoff hitter</a> <a href="Tim%20Raines">Tim Raines</a> while batting in the ninth spot in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28baseball%29">batting order</a>. By year's end Jeter far exceeded Torre's expectations – and anyone's – hitting .314 with 10 home runs, 104 <a href="runs%20scored">runs scored</a>, and 78 RBIs. He was named the unanimous <a href="MLB%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20award">AL Rookie of the Year</a>, receiving all 28 first-place votes in only the fifth sweep in the honor's 50-year history.

The Yankees reached the 1996 postseason, and Torre batted Jeter in the leadoff spot based on his strong year-long performance. During Game 1 of the <a href="1996%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1996 American League Championship Series (ALCS)</a>, the Yankees trailed the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> 4–3 in the 8th inning when Jeter hit a fly ball to <a href="right%20fielder">right field</a> that was ruled a home run by the <a href="Umpire%20%28baseball%29">umpires</a> after twelve-year-old fan <a href="Jeffrey%20Maier">Jeffrey Maier</a> reached over the wall to catch the ball. Though the ball would have remained in play if not for Maier, and could have been caught by <a href="Tony%20Tarasco">Tony Tarasco</a>, the home run stood as called, tying the game. It marked the first home run of Jeter's postseason career. The Yankees won the game and defeated the Orioles in five games. Overall, Jeter batted .361 in the 1996 postseason, helping to lead the Yankees offensively with <a href="Bernie%20Williams">Bernie Williams</a>, as <a href="Wade%20Boggs">Wade Boggs</a>, <a href="Paul%20O%27Neill%20%28baseball%29">Paul O'Neill</a>, and <a href="Tino%20Martinez">Tino Martinez</a> struggled. The Yankees defeated the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a> in the <a href="1996%20World%20Series">1996 World Series</a> to win their first championship since the <a href="1978%20World%20Series">1978 World Series</a>.

Following his Rookie of the Year campaign, considered the "new crop" of shortstops, along with <a href="Alex%20Rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a> and <a href="Nomar%20Garciaparra">Nomar Garciaparra</a>, as the careers of older shortstops such as <a href="Cal%20Ripken%20Jr.">Cal Ripken Jr.</a>, <a href="Barry%20Larkin">Barry Larkin</a>, <a href="Ozzie%20Smith">Ozzie Smith</a>, and <a href="Alan%20Trammell">Alan Trammell</a> were concluding. Rodriguez, the first overall selection in the <a href="1993%20MLB%20draft">1993 MLB draft</a>, first contacted Jeter about his experiences as a high-first round pick. The two became friends to the extent that "The New York Times" journalist Jack Curry commented "[r]arely have two higher-profile opponents been as close". Rodriguez described Jeter as being "like my brother", even though they were on-field adversaries.

Before the <a href="1997%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1997 season</a>, Jeter and the Yankees agreed on a $540,000 contract with performance bonuses. Becoming the Yankees' leadoff batter, Jeter batted .291, with 10 home runs, 70 RBIs, 116 runs, and 190 <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a>. Though he hit two home runs during the <a href="1997%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">1997 American League Division Series</a>, the Yankees lost to the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, three games to two.

Jeter earned $750,000 for the <a href="1998%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1998 season</a>. That year, Jeter was selected for his first <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Game</a>. In the regular season, he batted .324 with a league-leading 127 runs, 19 home runs, and 84 RBIs, for a team that won 114 games during the regular season and is widely considered to be one of the greatest of all time. In the playoffs, Jeter hit only .176 in the <a href="1998%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">1998 ALDS</a> and <a href="1998%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>, but batted .353 in the <a href="1998%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, as the Yankees defeated the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a> in four games. At season's end, Jeter finished third in voting for the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award</a>.

Eligible for <a href="salary%20arbitration">salary arbitration</a> for the first time before the <a href="1999%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1999 season</a>, Jeter was awarded a $5 million salary. Jeter led the AL in hits that season with 219, while finishing second in the league in batting average (.349) and runs scored (134), appearing in his second All-Star game that year. His season totals in batting average, runs, hits, runs batted in, <a href="Double%20%28baseball%29">doubles</a> (37), <a href="Triple%20%28baseball%29">triples</a> (9), home runs (24), SLG (.552), and OBP (.438) are all personal bests. Jeter, who for part of the year hit third in the batting order, also drove in 102 runs, becoming only the second Yankee shortstop to do so, following <a href="Lyn%20Lary">Lyn Lary</a>'s 107 RBIs in 1931. In the postseason, Jeter batted .455 in the <a href="1999%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a>, .350 in the <a href="1999%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">ALCS</a>, and .353 in the <a href="1999%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, as the Yankees defeated the Braves to win another championship, Jeter's third.

During the 1999–2000 offseason, the Yankees negotiated with Jeter, tentatively agreeing to a seven-year, $118.5 million contract. However, because Steinbrenner did not want to set a record for the largest contract, Stein <a href="Juan%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20%28baseball%29">Juan González</a> and the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> negotiated on a reported eight-year, $143 million contract extension. When that agreement fell through, so did Jeter's tentative deal. To avoid arbitration, Jeter and the Yankees agreed to a one-year deal worth $10 million.

Jeter batted a team-best .339 in the 2000 regular season and added 15 home runs, 73 RBIs, 119 runs scored, and 22 stolen bases. In the <a href="2000%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">2000 MLB All-Star Game</a>, he recorded three hits, including a two-run single that gave his team the lead and victory. The performance earned him the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">All-Star Game MVP Award</a>, the first time a Yankee won the award. During the postseason, he batted only .211 in the <a href="2000%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">Division Series</a> but rebounded to hit .318 in the <a href="2000%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">Championship Series</a> against the <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a>, and .409 in the <a href="2000%20World%20Series">World Series</a> against the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a>. Jeter added two home runs, a triple, and two doubles in the World Series, including a leadoff home run on the first pitch of Game 4 and a triple later in the third inning. His home run in Game 5 tied the game and extended his World Series hitting streak to 14 games. The Yankees defeated the Mets in five games for their third consecutive title and fourth in Jeter's first five full seasons. Jeter won the <a href="World%20Series%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">World Series MVP Award</a>, becoming the only player to win the All-Star Game MVP and World Series MVP Awards in the same season.

With one year remaining until he would become eligible for <a href="free%20agent">free agency</a>, Jeter signed a ten-year, $189 million contract before the 2001 season to remain with the Yankees. <a href="Alex%20Rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a> had signed a ten-year, $252 million contract with the <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a> earlier in the offseason, setting the market for Jeter's negotiations. Jeter became the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20sports%20contracts">second-highest-paid athlete</a> across all <a href="team%20sport">team sport</a>s and <a href="auto%20racing">auto racing</a>, trailing only Rodriguez. The $18.9 million average annual value of Jeter's contract was the third-highest in baseball, behind only Rodriguez ($25.2 million) and <a href="Manny%20Ramirez">Manny Ramirez</a> ($20 million).

In 2001, Jeter posted another strong season, batting .311 with 21 home runs, 74 RBIs, 110 runs scored, and 27 stolen bases, making his fourth All-Star appearance. Jeter made a notable defensive <a href="assist%20%28baseball%29">assist</a> in Game 3 of the <a href="2001%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">2001 American League Division Series</a> against the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a>. With <a href="Jeremy%20Giambi">Jeremy Giambi</a> on <a href="first%20base">first base</a>, Oakland right fielder <a href="Terrence%20Long">Terrence Long</a> hit a double off Yankees pitcher <a href="Mike%20Mussina">Mike Mussina</a> into the right-field corner. As Giambi rounded <a href="third%20base">third base</a> and headed for <a href="home%20plate">home plate</a>, Yankees right fielder <a href="Shane%20Spencer">Shane Spencer</a> retrieved the ball and made a wild throw that missed <a href="cut-off%20man">cut-off man</a> Tino Martinez and dribbled down the first-base line. Jeter ran from shortstop to grab the ball and flipped it backhanded to catcher <a href="Jorge%20Posada">Jorge Posada</a>, rather than throwing it overhand. Posada tagged Giambi out on the leg just before he crossed home plate, preserving the Yankees' one-run lead. Facing elimination, the Yankees eventually won the game, as well as the series. The play, known as "The Flip", was later voted seventh in "<a href="Baseball%20Weekly">Baseball Weekly</a>"s 10 Most Amazing Plays of all time, and won the 2002 <a href="Best%20Play%20ESPY%20Award">Best Play ESPY Award</a>.
As a result of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, the start of the playoffs was delayed and the season's end was extended past the usual October timeframe. The Yankees advanced to the <a href="2001%20World%20Series">2001 World Series</a> to face the <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>. Game 4 marked the first time that any non-exhibition MLB game had been played in the month of November. In extra innings, Jeter hit a game-winning home run off of <a href="Byung-hyun%20Kim">Byung-hyun Kim</a>. The words "Mr. November" flashed on the scoreboard, alluding to former Yankee <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a>'s nickname, "Mr. October". Despite the home run, Jeter slumped at the plate; he denied injuries were a factor, though a fall into a photographer's box trying to catch a <a href="foul%20ball">foul ball</a> may have aggravated an earlier <a href="hamstring">hamstring</a> injury. Jeter batted .148 in the World Series, as the Yankees lost in seven games.

Jeter batted .297, with 18 home runs, 75 RBIs, 124 runs scored, 191 hits, and a career-best 32 stolen bases during the <a href="2002%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2002 regular season</a>. He led the majors in stolen base percentage (91.4%), getting caught only three times. He made his fifth All-Star appearance. In the 2002 postseason, the <a href="Anaheim%20Angels">Anaheim Angels</a> defeated the Yankees in the <a href="2002%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">ALDS</a> on their way to winning the <a href="2002%20World%20Series">World Series</a>.

On Opening Day of the <a href="2003%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2003 season</a>, Jeter dislocated his left shoulder when he collided with <a href="Toronto%20Blue%20Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a> catcher <a href="Ken%20Huckaby">Ken Huckaby</a> at third base. He was placed on the <a href="disabled%20list">disabled list</a> for six weeks and missed 36 games; he had never played fewer than 148 games in the prior seven full seasons. Jeter returned to bat .324, finishing third in batting average to <a href="Bill%20Mueller">Bill Mueller</a>, who batted .326. Ramirez finished second.

Steinbrenner named Jeter the <a href="List%20of%20New%20York%20Yankees%20captains">captain of the Yankees</a> on June 3, 2003, following eight seasons without a captain after <a href="Don%20Mattingly">Don Mattingly</a> retired in 1995. That postseason, Jeter batted .314 with two home runs, five RBIs, and 10 runs scored across 17 playoff games, including three hits in Game 3 of the <a href="2003%20World%20Series">2003 World Series</a> against the <a href="Florida%20Marlins">Florida Marlins</a> – the only three hits <a href="Josh%20Beckett">Josh Beckett</a> allowed during the game. Jeter committed a crucial error in a Game 6 loss, and the Marlins won the series in six games.

The Yankees acquired Rodriguez from the <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a> during the 2003–04 offseason. Rodriguez had won two <a href="List%20of%20Gold%20Glove%20Award%20winners%20at%20shortstop">Gold Glove Awards at shortstop</a> and was considered the best shortstop in baseball. Jeter—who had no Gold Gloves at the time—remained the team's starting shortstop while Rodriguez moved to third base. Rodriguez's fielding range allowed Jeter to cede ground to his right to Rodriguez and cheat to his left: fielding balls hit to his left is a weakness identified by scouts. The 2004 season began with Jeter mired in a slump, at one point getting only one hit in a span of 36 at-bats; through April, he batted .168. His batting average improved to .277 by the <a href="All-Star%20break%20%28MLB%29">All-Star break</a> in July.

Jeter made the All-Star team and finished the season with a .292 average; 23 home runs, the second-most of his career; 78 RBIs; 111 runs scored; and a career-best 44 doubles, which broke the Yankee single-season record for doubles by a shortstop, besting <a href="Tony%20Kubek">Tony Kubek</a>'s 38 in 1961. He batted .316 with a team-leading four RBIs as the Yankees defeated the <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> in the <a href="2004%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">2004 ALDS</a>. Jeter struggled in the <a href="2004%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">2004 ALCS</a>, batting .200 with one <a href="extra%20base%20hit">extra base hit</a>, as the Yankees lost the series to the Red Sox in seven games, despite winning the first three games.

In the 12th inning of a tied game on July 1, 2004, against their <a href="Yankees%E2%80%93Red%20Sox%20rivalry">rivals</a>, the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, <a href="Trot%20Nixon">Trot Nixon</a> hit a <a href="pop%20fly">pop fly</a> down the left field line. Jeter ran from his position at shortstop and made an over-the-shoulder catch. He launched himself over the third-base side railing and two rows of seats, receiving a lacerated chin and bruised face. The Yankees went on to win the game in the bottom of the 13th inning. This was voted the Play of the Year in the "<a href="This%20Year%20in%20Baseball%20Awards">This Year in Baseball Awards</a>" competition, as voted on by fans at MLB.com. Following the 2004 season, Jeter was presented with his first Gold Glove Award; his diving catch on July 1 was cited as a reason for the award. Though Jeter was fourth among shortstops in <a href="fielding%20percentage">fielding percentage</a> and errors, two traditional fielding statistics, critics pointed to his lower ratings in the more advanced <a href="sabermetric">sabermetric</a> statistics, such as <a href="range%20factor">range factor</a> and <a href="ultimate%20zone%20rating">ultimate zone rating</a> (UZR).

Jeter was second in the AL in runs scored (122) in the 2005 season, and was third in the league in both at bats (654) and hits (202). Though his critics continued to see Jeter as a liability defensively, he won his second consecutive Gold Glove in 2005. <a href="Orlando%20Cabrera">Orlando Cabrera</a> of the Angels had a higher fielding percentage and committed fewer errors, but voters noted that Jeter had more assists. Though Jeter batted .333 during the <a href="2005%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">2005 ALDS</a>, the Yankees lost to the Angels.

For the 2006 season, the Yankees signed <a href="Johnny%20Damon">Johnny Damon</a> to play center field and lead off, moving Jeter to the second position in the batting lineup. During the <a href="2006%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2006 season</a>, Jeter recorded his 2,000th career hit, becoming the eighth Yankee to reach the milestone. Jeter finished the season second in the AL in both batting average (.343) and runs scored (118), third in hits (214), and fourth in OBP (.417), earning his seventh All-Star selection. Jeter batted .500 with one home run in the <a href="2006%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">2006 ALDS</a>, including a perfect 5-for-5 performance in Game 1, making him the sixth player to record five hits in one postseason game. The Yankees lost to the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>, three games to one.

Many expected Jeter would win the AL MVP Award for 2006. In a close vote, Jeter finished second in the voting to <a href="Justin%20Morneau">Justin Morneau</a> of the Twins. It was his sixth top-10 finish in the MVP balloting in 11 full seasons through 2006. Though he lost the MVP Award, he won the <a href="Hank%20Aaron%20Award">Hank Aaron Award</a>, given for superior offensive performance. He also won his third consecutive Gold Glove Award.
Though the Yankees continued to struggle with postseason failures, Jeter remained a consistent contributor. During the <a href="2007%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2007 season</a>, Jeter was third in the AL with 203 hits, his third consecutive season and sixth overall, with at least 200 hits. He also finished ninth in batting average (.322). He was selected for his eighth All-Star appearance. In the field, he was involved in turning a career-high 104 <a href="double%20play">double play</a>s. He struggled during the <a href="2007%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">2007 ALDS</a>, batting 3-for-17 (.176) with one RBI, as the Indians defeated the Yankees.

Jeter hit his 400th career double on June 27, 2008, and his 200th home run on July 12. Jeter's <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> (SLG) dropped to .410 in the <a href="2008%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2008 season</a>, his lowest mark since 1997. His offense took an upward turn after May as he hit .322 with a .824 OPS after June 1. Jeter was elected to his <a href="2008%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">ninth All-Star game</a> as the starting shortstop. He finished the season with a .300 batting average.

Jeter tied <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>'s record for hits at <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> (1,269) with a home run off <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Rays">Tampa Bay Rays</a> pitcher <a href="David%20Price%20%28baseball%29">David Price</a> on September 14, 2008. On September 16, he broke the record against <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> pitcher <a href="Gavin%20Floyd">Gavin Floyd</a>. The Yankees were eliminated from postseason contention, the only full season in Jeter's career where he did not compete in the playoffs. Following the final game in Yankee Stadium history, Jeter made a speech at the request of the Yankees, thanking the Yankees fans for their support—a moment later voted by fans as the Moment of the Year in MLB.com's This Year in Baseball Awards:
For the <a href="2009%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2009 season</a>, Yankees <a href="Manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a> <a href="Joe%20Girardi">Joe Girardi</a> switched Jeter and Damon in the batting order, with Damon moving to second and Jeter to the leadoff role. Jeter batted .334, third-best in the AL, with a .406 OBP, an .871 OPS, 18 home runs, 66 RBIs, 30 stolen bases in 35 attempts, 107 runs scored, 72 walks, and 212 hits (second in MLB). Defensively, Jeter committed a career-low eight errors, and his .986 fielding percentage was his career best. The addition of Gold Glove-winning <a href="first%20baseman">first baseman</a> <a href="Mark%20Teixeira">Mark Teixeira</a> allowed <a href="second%20baseman">second baseman</a> <a href="Robinson%20Can%C3%B3">Robinson Canó</a> to shift his focus to his right, helping Jeter. During the season, the "<a href="Sporting%20News">Sporting News</a>" named Jeter eighth on their list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball.
Jeter achieved two career hit milestones in the second half of the 2009 season. On August 16, 2009, against the <a href="Seattle%20Mariners">Seattle Mariners</a>, Jeter doubled down the right-field line for his 2,675th hit as a shortstop, breaking <a href="Luis%20Aparicio">Luis Aparicio</a>'s previous major league record. Then, Jeter became the all-time hits leader as a member of the Yankees (2,722), passing <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a> on September 11, 2009. The hit was a single off Baltimore Orioles pitcher <a href="Chris%20Tillman">Chris Tillman</a> in the third inning.

In the 2009 postseason, Jeter batted .355, including .407 in the <a href="2009%20World%20Series">2009 World Series</a>, as he won his fifth World Series championship. He was named <a href="Sportsman%20of%20the%20Year">Sportsman of the Year</a> for 2009 by "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>", and won the <a href="Roberto%20Clemente%20Award">Roberto Clemente Award</a>, <a href="Hank%20Aaron%20Award">Hank Aaron Award</a>, his fourth Gold Glove Award and his fourth Silver Slugger Award. Jeter also finished third in the AL MVP voting, behind Minnesota's <a href="Joe%20Mauer">Joe Mauer</a> and Yankee teammate <a href="Mark%20Teixeira">Mark Teixeira</a>. It was also the fifth championship for Pettitte, Posada, and Rivera, who along with Jeter were referred to as the "<a href="Core%20Four">Core Four</a>".

In 2010, Jeter, along with Posada and Rivera, became the first trio of teammates in any of the four major league sports in North America (MLB, <a href="National%20Football%20League">NFL</a>, <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">NBA</a>, or <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">NHL</a>) to play in at least 16 consecutive seasons on the same team as teammates. The <a href="2010%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2010 season</a> was statistically Jeter's worst in many respects. The Yankee captain batted .270 with a .340 OBP and .370 SLG, all career lows, as he hit more ground balls than usual. Despite this, Jeter was elected to start at shortstop in the All-Star Game. He rebounded to bat .342 in his last 79 at-bats after making adjustments to his swing with the help of <a href="Kevin%20Long%20%28baseball%29">Kevin Long</a>, the Yankees hitting coach, who had successfully helped <a href="Nick%20Swisher">Nick Swisher</a> and <a href="Curtis%20Granderson">Curtis Granderson</a> make adjustments that improved their production. With Long, Jeter changed the way he strode with his left leg. Following the season, Jeter won his fifth Gold Glove award. Jeter committed six errors during the season, his lowest total in 15 full seasons.
After the 2010 season, Jeter became a <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a> for the first time in his career. At age 36, Jeter appeared to be in decline; <a href="Joe%20Sheehan">Joe Sheehan</a> of "<a href="Baseball%20Prospectus">Baseball Prospectus</a>" suggested that Jeter, once a "good, not great" shortstop, had declined to become "below average" defensively, to the extent that he would likely need to change positions; Cashman later acknowledged that Jeter might need to shift to the outfield. Though Jeter stated that he wanted to remain with the Yankees, negotiations became tense. Jeter's agent, <a href="Casey%20Close">Casey Close</a>, stated that he was "baffled" by the Yankees' approach to the negotiations, and Cashman, now the team's general manager, responded publicly that Jeter should test the open market to ascertain his value, which angered Jeter. According to reports, Jeter initially sought a four-year contract worth between $23 million and $25 million per season. He reached an agreement with the Yankees on a three-year contract for $51 million with an option for a fourth year. He spent the offseason working with Long on adjustments to his swing.

The adjustments left Jeter frustrated, as he batted .242 in the first month of the 2011 season. As he struggled, it appeared that the 2011 season was the continuation of Jeter's decline. Jeter broke <a href="Rickey%20Henderson">Rickey Henderson</a>'s franchise record for stolen bases when he stole his 327th base against the Mariners on May 28, 2011. He suffered a calf injury on June 13 that required his fifth stint on the 15-day <a href="disabled%20list">disabled list</a>, and his first since 2003. At that point, he was batting .260 for the <a href="2011%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2011 season</a> with a .649 OPS. Rehabilitating from his injury in Tampa, Jeter worked on his swing with Denbo, his former minor league manager. With Denbo, Jeter returned to the mechanics he used in his minor league days. Following his activation from the disabled list, he hit .326 with an .806 OPS in his last 64 games of the season. Jeter finished the year with a .297 batting average, 6 home runs, 61 runs batted in, 84 runs, and 16 stolen bases. He credited the turnaround to his work with Denbo; Long acknowledged that his attempt to adjust Jeter's swing did not work.
On July 9, 2011, Jeter recorded his <a href="3%2C000%20hit%20club">3,000th career hit</a>, a home run off of David Price of the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeter finished the day with five hits in five at-bats, the second player to have five hits on the day he achieved his 3,000th hit (the first was <a href="Craig%20Biggio">Craig Biggio</a>). He also became the second player to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit, <a href="Wade%20Boggs">Wade Boggs</a> having done so in 1999. The last of Jeter's five hits proved to be the game-winning hit. He is the only member of the 3,000 hit club to record all of his hits with the New York Yankees, and the only player to join the club as a Yankee. Jeter joined <a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a> as only the second regular shortstop to reach the 3,000 hit plataeu. Only <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>, and <a href="Robin%20Yount">Robin Yount</a> were younger than Jeter on the day of their 3,000th hit. MLB and <a href="HBO">HBO</a> produced "Derek Jeter 3K", a documentary that profiled his path to 3,000 hits and originally aired on July 28, 2011.

Fatigued from the stress of chasing 3,000 career hits and wanting to rest his calf, Jeter opted not to attend the <a href="2011%20MLB%20All-Star%20Game">2011 MLB All-Star Game</a>. Jeter and Posada played their 1,660th game together on July 14, 2011, breaking the previous franchise record of 1,659 by Gehrig and <a href="Tony%20Lazzeri">Tony Lazzeri</a>. Jeter played his 2,402nd game with the Yankees on August 29, 2011, breaking <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a>'s record for most <a href="games%20played">games played</a> as a Yankee. He finished the 2011 season with 162 hits, his 16th consecutive season with 150 hits, which tied him with <a href="Pete%20Rose">Pete Rose</a> for the second-most consecutive 150-hit seasons, one behind <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a> for the MLB record. Jeter was honored with the <a href="Lou%20Gehrig%20Memorial%20Award">Lou Gehrig Memorial Award</a>, given in recognition of charitable endeavors.

Despite continuing concerns about his age, the beginning of the <a href="2012%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2012 season</a> saw Jeter on a hot streak: he batted .411 through April 23. Rodriguez commented that Jeter is playing as he did in 1999, while Girardi said Jeter looks like he is 25 years old. In the <a href="2012%20MLB%20All-Star%20Game">2012 MLB All-Star Game</a>, Jeter recorded his eleventh All-Star hit, passing Mantle for the most All-Star Game hits in Yankees history. Jeter went 1-for-2 in the game, moving into fourth all-time with a .458 average among players with a minimum of 12 plate appearances in the All-Star Game.

Jeter finished the 2012 season with the most hits in MLB (216). Against the Tampa Bay Rays on September 14 of that year, he moved into the Top 10 on the all-time hit list, surpassing <a href="Willie%20Mays">Willie Mays</a> by beating out an infield single for his 3,284th career hit. After hitting .364 in the <a href="2012%20American%20League%20Division%20Series">2012 ALDS</a>, Jeter fractured his left ankle during Game 1 of the <a href="2012%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">2012 ALCS</a> against the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> reaching for a ground ball, an injury which ended his season. Jeter had received a <a href="cortisone">cortisone</a> shot to treat a bone bruise in his left foot in September, which could have contributed to the break. Jeter had surgery on his broken left ankle on October 20, with an expected recovery time of four to five months.

While rehabilitating, Jeter suffered a small crack in the area of his previous ankle fracture. As a result, Jeter began the 2013 season on the disabled list. The Yankees activated Jeter on July 11, but after playing in one game, Jeter returned to the disabled list with a <a href="quadriceps">quadriceps</a> strain. He returned to the Yankees lineup on July 28, hitting a home run on the first pitch off of <a href="Matt%20Moore%20%28baseball%29">Matt Moore</a> of Tampa Bay. Jeter was again placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 5 due to a Grade 1 <a href="Calf%20%28anatomy%29">calf</a> <a href="Strain%20%28injury%29">strain</a>, and after a brief return to the lineup, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list for a third time on September 11 due to problems with his ankle, ending his season. On September 14, 2013 Jeter was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. Jeter batted .190 in only 17 games played during the 2013 season.

Jeter re-signed with the Yankees on a one-year, $12 million contract for the 2014 season. Jeter announced on his <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page on February 12, 2014, that the <a href="2014%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">2014 season</a> would be his last. During his final season, each opposing team honored Jeter with a gift during his final visit to their city, which has included donations to Jeter's charity, the <a href="Turn%202%20Foundation">Turn 2 Foundation</a>.
On July 10, Jeter recorded his 1,000th career multi-hit game, becoming the fourth player to do so. He was elected to start at shortstop in the <a href="2014%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">2014 All-Star Game</a>, and batted leadoff for the AL. Jeter went 2 for 2, scored one run and received two standing ovations in the four innings he played at the 2014 All-Star Game. As a result, Jeter's .481 career All-Star batting average (13 for 27) ranked him fifth all-time (among players with at least 10 at-bats). At 40, Jeter also became the oldest player to have two or more hits in an All-Star Game. In July, Jeter broke <a href="Omar%20Vizquel">Omar Vizquel</a>'s MLB career record of 2,609 games started at <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a>, and Gehrig's franchise career record of 534 doubles. On July 17, Derek scored the 1,900th run of his career becoming the 10th player in MLB history to do so. Jeter passed <a href="Carl%20Yastrzemski">Carl Yastrzemski</a> for seventh place on MLB's all-time career hit list on July 28 and on August 11 he passed <a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a> climbing to sixth on the all-time hits list.

The Yankees honored Jeter with a pregame tribute on September 7. Beginning with that day's game, the Yankees wore a patch on their hats and uniforms honoring Jeter for the remainder of the season. In the final week of Jeter's career, MLB Commissioner <a href="Bud%20Selig">Bud Selig</a> honored him as the 15th recipient of the <a href="Commissioner%27s%20Historic%20Achievement%20Award">Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award</a> for being "one of the most accomplished shortstops of all-time".

During Jeter's final <a href="series%20%28baseball%29">series</a> at Yankee Stadium, <a href="Louisville%20Slugger">Louisville Slugger</a> announced they would retire their "P72" model <a href="baseball%20bat">baseball bat</a>, the bat Jeter uses, though it will be sold under the name "DJ2", in Jeter's honor. The average ticket price for Jeter's final home game, on September 25, reached $830 on the <a href="secondary%20market">secondary market</a>. In his final game at Yankee Stadium, Jeter hit a <a href="Walk-off%20hit">walk-off</a> single against <a href="2014%20Baltimore%20Orioles%20season">Orioles</a> pitcher <a href="Evan%20Meek">Evan Meek</a> to win the game, 6–5.

Jeter decided to play exclusively as the <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a> in the final series of his career, at <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a> in Boston, so that his final memories of playing shortstop would be at Yankee Stadium. The Red Sox honored Jeter with a pregame ceremony including Red Sox retired stars <a href="Carl%20Yastrzemski">Carl Yastrzemski</a>, <a href="Jim%20Rice">Jim Rice</a>, <a href="Fred%20Lynn">Fred Lynn</a>, <a href="Luis%20Tiant">Luis Tiant</a> and <a href="Rico%20Petrocelli">Rico Petrocelli</a>, the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>' <a href="Bobby%20Orr">Bobby Orr</a>, <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a> receiver <a href="Troy%20Brown">Troy Brown</a> and the <a href="Boston%20Celtics">Boston Celtics</a>' <a href="Paul%20Pierce">Paul Pierce</a>, while many Boston fans at Fenway Park loudly cheered for Jeter and gave him a standing ovation. In his final at-bat, he hit an RBI infield single against <a href="Clay%20Buchholz">Clay Buchholz</a>, before being substituted for pinch runner <a href="Brian%20McCann%20%28baseball%29">Brian McCann</a>; he received an ovation from the Red Sox fans as he exited the field.

Jeter started at shortstop for the <a href="United%20States%20national%20baseball%20team">United States national baseball team</a> in the <a href="2006%20World%20Baseball%20Classic">2006 World Baseball Classic</a>. He hit 9-for-20 (.450) and scored five runs in six games. Only teammate <a href="Ken%20Griffey%2C%20Jr.">Ken Griffey, Jr.</a> (.524) and <a href="Cuba%20national%20baseball%20team">Cuba's</a> <a href="Yoandy%20Garlobo">Yoandy Garlobo</a> (.480) had a higher batting average with a minimum of 20 at-bats. Jeter's play earned him recognition as the shortstop selection on the All-Tournament Team.

In the <a href="2009%20World%20Baseball%20Classic">2009 World Baseball Classic</a>, Jeter again started at shortstop. He was named captain of the United States team by manager <a href="Davey%20Johnson">Davey Johnson</a>, and he batted 8-for-29 (.276) in eight games. Jeter and the United States team faced the Yankees at <a href="Steinbrenner%20Field">Steinbrenner Field</a> in an exhibition game, the only time Jeter played against the Yankees.

Jeter is considered to be one of the most consistent baseball players of all time. He played fewer than 145 games a season only three times in his career: when he dislocated his left shoulder on Opening Day 2003 (119 games), when he injured his calf in 2011 (131 games), and in 2013 when he struggled with a myriad of injuries (17 games). For his career, he averaged 204 <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a>, 113 <a href="runs%20scored">runs scored</a> and 21 <a href="stolen%20bases">stolen bases</a> per 162 games. He is currently 6th on the all-time hits list in Major League Baseball history. Highly competitive, Jeter once said, "If you're going to play at all, you're out to win. Baseball, <a href="board%20game">board game</a>s, playing "<a href="Jeopardy%21">Jeopardy!</a>", I hate to lose." Seen as one of the best players of his generation, most sportswriters believe that Jeter will be a 1st ballot induction to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> and potentially a unanimous selection in his first year of eligibility (2020).
An aggressive hitter, Jeter swings at most pitches in the strike zone and many near it. Though right-handed hitters often pull the ball into left field, Jeter's signature inside-out swing, dubbed the "Jeterian Swing", results in most of his hits going to center and right field. Similarly, most of his home runs have been hit to right field rather than to center or to left, as his swing takes advantage of Yankee Stadium's close right-field fences.

Jeter is also known for his professionalism. In an age where professional athletes often find themselves in personal scandals, Jeter has mostly avoided major controversy in a high-profile career in New York City while maintaining a strong work ethic. Due to his style of play, opponents and teammates held Jeter in high esteem. A clubhouse leader, Jeter often defused confrontations between teammates.

Jeter is noted for his postseason performances and has earned the titles of "Captain <a href="Clutch%20hitter">Clutch</a>", and "Mr. November" due to his outstanding postseason play. He has a career .309 postseason batting average, and a .321 batting average in the World Series. Except for 2008, 2013 and 2014, the Yankees have been to the postseason every year since Jeter joined the team. Jeter holds MLB postseason records for <a href="games%20played">games played</a> (158), <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a>s (734), at-bats (650), hits (200), singles (143), doubles (32), triples (5), runs scored (111), total bases (302) and strikeouts (135). Jeter is also third in home runs (20), fourth in runs batted in (61), fifth in base on balls (66) and sixth in stolen bases (18).

Jeter has won five <a href="Gold%20Glove%20Award">Gold Glove Award</a>s, trailing only Vizquel, <a href="Ozzie%20Smith">Ozzie Smith</a>, <a href="Luis%20Aparicio">Luis Aparicio</a>, <a href="Dave%20Concepci%C3%B3n">Dave Concepción</a>, and <a href="Mark%20Belanger">Mark Belanger</a> for most by a shortstop. He is credited with positioning himself well and for a quick release when he throws the ball. One of his signature defensive plays is the "jump-throw", by which he leaps and throws to first base while moving towards third base.

Despite this, Jeter's defense has been the subject of criticism from a number of <a href="sabermetrics">sabermetricians</a>, including <a href="Rob%20Neyer">Rob Neyer</a> and the publication "<a href="Baseball%20Prospectus">Baseball Prospectus</a>". The 2006 book "The Fielding Bible" by John Dewan contains an essay by <a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a> in which he concludes that Jeter "was probably the most ineffective defensive player in the major leagues, at any position" over his entire career. A 2008 study by researchers at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> found that, from 2002 through 2005, Jeter was the worst defensive shortstop in MLB. Two sites that rely on advanced defensive statistics, <a href="FanGraphs.com">FanGraphs.com</a> and <a href="FieldingBible.com">FieldingBible.com</a>, rated Jeter below middle-of-the-pack status in 2010, despite his receiving his fifth Gold Glove Award that season.

Jeter committed 18 errors in 2007, his highest total since finishing with 24 in 2000. After the season, Cashman and his staff saw Jeter's defense as an area that needed to be addressed. At the Yankees' request, Jeter embarked on a rigorous training program to combat the effects of age, by focusing on lateral movement and first-step quickness. Jeter's <a href="ultimate%20zone%20rating">ultimate zone rating</a> (UZR) improved from worst in the AL for shortstops in 2007 to close to league average in 2008.

When asked to respond to criticism of his defense, Jeter replied: "I play in New York, man. Criticism is part of the game, you take criticism as a challenge." Jeter further asserted that many defensive factors cannot be quantified. The controversy over Jeter's fielding has become a flash point for the debate over whether the analyses of statistics or subjective observation is the better method to assess a player's defensive ability and for criticism of the Gold Glove Award.
Jeter maintains homes in <a href="Marlboro%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Marlboro Township, New Jersey</a>; <a href="Greenwood%20Lake%2C%20New%20York">Greenwood Lake, New York</a>; and the <a href="Davis%20Islands%2C%20Tampa%2C%20Florida">Davis Islands</a> neighborhood of <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>. He previously owned a penthouse apartment in Manhattan's <a href="Trump%20World%20Tower">Trump World Tower</a>. Regarding his official residence, Jeter settled a tax dispute with the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Department%20of%20Taxation%20and%20Finance">New York State Department of Taxation and Finance</a> in 2008. New York State alleged that Jeter should have paid state <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> from 2001 to 2003, as Jeter resided in the Manhattan apartment he bought in 2001; Jeter claimed to have established his residence in Tampa, Florida, in 1994 and that he was still a resident of Florida at the time. Florida has no state income tax.
Jeter's personal life has been a frequent topic in gossip columns and celebrity magazines since his rookie year in 1996. He had a well-publicized relationship with singer <a href="Mariah%20Carey">Mariah Carey</a> from 1997 to 1998. Jeter also had a relationship with model <a href="Vida%20Guerra">Vida Guerra</a>.

In December 2002, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner criticized Jeter for staying out until 3 a.m. at a birthday party during the 2002 season, saying that his star shortstop "wasn't totally focused" and that "it didn't sit well" with him. The two mocked the incident in a May 2003 <a href="VISA">VISA</a> commercial, similar to the manner in which Steinbrenner and former Yankees manager <a href="Billy%20Martin">Billy Martin</a> made light of their feud in a <a href="Miller%20Lite">Miller Lite</a> commercial during the 1970s.

Jeter and Davis became engaged in 2015. In July 2016, the two married. On February 13, 2017, Hannah announced that she was pregnant with a daughter. Their first child, a daughter, was born in August 2017. Their second daughter was born in January 2019.

During his injury-shortened 2013 season, Jeter arranged a partnership with <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a> to form an <a href="imprint%20%28trade%20name%29">imprint</a> called Jeter Publishing. He called it "the blueprint for postcareer". It will begin publishing nonfiction books for adults, children's picture books, elementary grade fiction, and books for children who are learning to read. Eventually, the partnership could lead to film and television productions.

On October 1, 2014, Jeter's new website, <a href="The%20Players%27%20Tribune">ThePlayersTribune.com</a>, appeared online; it was billed as "a new media platform that will present the unfiltered voice of professional athletes, bringing fans closer to the games they love than ever before". It was reported by the Tampa Bay Business Journal in March 2015 that Jeter had partnered with Concessions Tampa to bid for a space within the Tampa International Airport, and plans to open a restaurant named after his website.

Jeter also serves as a brand development officer for <a href="Luvo%20Inc.">Luvo Inc.</a> and has investment interests in multi-channel video network company, <a href="Whistle%20Sports%20Network">Whistle Sports Network</a>. He explored purchasing the <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a> football team in 2014.

In July 2017, Jeter engaged in the bidding for ownership of the <a href="Miami%20Marlins">Miami Marlins</a>. In August 2017, Jeter and <a href="Bruce%20Sherman">Bruce Sherman</a> finalized a deal to purchase the Miami Marlins. The sale was completed in September 2017, following unanimous approval of the other 29 MLB team owners. Though Jeter only owns a 4% stake in the franchise, he was named <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">chief executive officer</a> of the team, and controlling owner Bruce Sherman entrusted him to oversee day-to-day operations of the team.

Jeter created the <a href="Turn%202%20Foundation">Turn 2 Foundation</a>, a charitable organization, in 1996. It was established to help children and teenagers avoid <a href="drug%20addiction">drug</a> and <a href="alcoholism">alcohol addiction</a>, and to reward those who show high academic achievement.

John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan

Richard John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan (18 December 1934 – disappeared 8 November 1974), commonly known as Lord Lucan, was a British <a href="Peerages%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">peer</a> who disappeared after being suspected of murder. He was an <a href="Anglo-Irish%20people">Anglo-Irish</a> aristocrat, the eldest son of <a href="George%20Bingham%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Lucan">George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan</a> by his mother, Kaitlin Dawson. An <a href="Evacuations%20of%20civilians%20in%20Britain%20during%20World%20War%20II">evacuee</a> during the Second World War, Lucan returned to attend <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>, and then from 1953 to 1955 served with the <a href="Coldstream%20Guards">Coldstream Guards</a> in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>. He developed a taste for gambling and, skilled at <a href="backgammon">backgammon</a> and <a href="Contract%20bridge">bridge</a>, became an early member of the <a href="Clermont%20Club%23Clermont%20Club">Clermont Club</a>. Although his losses often exceeded his winnings, he left his job at a London-based <a href="merchant%20bank">merchant bank</a> and became a professional gambler. He was known as Lord Bingham from April 1949 until January 1964, during his father's lifetime.

Once considered for the role of <a href="James%20Bond%20%28character%29">James Bond</a> in the cinematic adaptations of <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>'s novels, Lucan was known for his expensive tastes; he raced <a href="Offshore%20powerboat%20racing">power boats</a> and drove an <a href="Aston%20Martin">Aston Martin</a>. In 1963 he married Veronica Duncan, by whom he had three children. When the marriage collapsed late in 1972, he moved out of the family home at 46 <a href="Lower%20Belgrave%20Street">Lower Belgrave Street</a>, in London's <a href="Belgravia">Belgravia</a>, to a property nearby. A bitter custody battle ensued, which Lucan lost. He began to spy on his wife and record their telephone conversations, apparently obsessed with regaining custody of the children. This fixation, combined with his gambling losses, had a dramatic effect on his life and personal finances.

On the evening of 7 November 1974, the children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was bludgeoned to death in the basement of the Lucan family home. Lady Lucan was also attacked; she later identified Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation, Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove a borrowed <a href="Ford%20Corsair">Ford Corsair</a> to a friend's house in <a href="Uckfield">Uckfield</a>, East Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and vanished without trace. The car was found abandoned in <a href="Newhaven%2C%20East%20Sussex">Newhaven</a>, its interior stained with blood and its <a href="Trunk%20%28automobile%29">boot</a> containing a piece of bandaged <a href="lead%20pipe">lead pipe</a> similar to one found at the crime scene. A warrant for Lucan's arrest was issued a few days later, and in his absence the <a href="Inquests%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">inquest</a> into Rivett's death named him as her murderer, the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court did so.

Within Britain, there has been continuing interest in Lucan's fate. Since Rivett's murder, hundreds of reported sightings have been made in various countries around the world; none have been substantiated. Despite a police investigation and huge press interest, Lucan has not been found. He was presumed deceased <a href="in%20chambers">in chambers</a> on 11 December 1992 and declared <a href="Declared%20death%20in%20absentia">legally dead</a> in October 1999; a death certificate was issued in 2016.

Richard John Bingham was born on 18 December 1934 at 19 Bentinck Street, <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>, London, the second child and elder son of <a href="George%20Bingham%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Lucan">George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan</a>, an <a href="Anglo-Irish%20people">Anglo-Irish</a> peer, and his wife Kaitlin Elizabeth Anne Dawson. A blood clot found in her lung forced his mother to remain in a nursing home, so John, as he became known, was initially cared for by the family's nurserymaid. Aged three years, he attended a <a href="Preparatory%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">pre-prep school</a> in <a href="Tite%20Street">Tite Street</a> with his elder sister Jane, but in 1939, with war approaching, the two were taken to the relative safety of <a href="Wales">Wales</a>. The following year, joined by their younger siblings Sally and Hugh, the Lucan children travelled to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, moving shortly thereafter to <a href="Mount%20Kisco%2C%20New%20York">Mount Kisco, New York</a>. They stayed for five years with multi-millionairess <a href="Marcia%20Brady%20Tucker">Marcia Brady Tucker</a>; John was enrolled at <a href="The%20Harvey%20School">The Harvey School</a> and spent summer holidays away from his siblings at a summer camp in the <a href="Adirondack%20Mountains">Adirondack Mountains</a>.

While in the U.S., John and his siblings lived in grandeur and wanted for nothing, but on their return to England in February 1945 they were faced with the stark realities of <a href="Timeline%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20home%20front%20during%20World%20War%20II">wartime Britain</a>. <a href="Rationing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23World%20War%20II">Rationing</a> was still in force, their former home at <a href="Cheyne%20Walk">Cheyne Walk</a> had been bombed, and the house at 22 <a href="Eaton%20Square">Eaton Square</a> had had its windows blown out. Despite the family's noble ancestry, the 6th Earl and his wife were <a href="agnosticism">agnostics</a> and <a href="History%20of%20the%20socialist%20movement%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">socialists</a> and preferred a more austere existence than that offered by Tucker, an extremely wealthy Christian. For a time, John suffered nightmares and was taken to a psychotherapist. As an adult he remained an agnostic, but ensured that his children attended <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a>, preferring to give them a traditional childhood.

At <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>, John developed a taste for gambling. He supplemented his pocket money with income from <a href="Bookmaker">bookmaking</a>, placing his earnings into a "secret" bank account, and regularly left the school's grounds to attend <a href="Horseracing%20in%20Great%20Britain">horse races</a>. According to his mother his academic record was "far from creditable", but he became Captain of Roe's House, before leaving in 1953 to undertake his <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">National Service</a>. He became a <a href="Second%20lieutenant%23United%20Kingdom%20and%20Commonwealth">second lieutenant</a> in his father's regiment, the <a href="Coldstream%20Guards">Coldstream Guards</a>, and was stationed mainly in <a href="Krefeld">Krefeld</a>, West Germany. While there, he also became a keen <a href="poker">poker</a> player.

On leaving the army in 1955, Lucan joined a London-based merchant bank, <a href="William%20Brandt%27s%20Sons%20and%20Co">William Brandt's Sons and Co</a>., on an annual salary of £500. In 1960 he met Stephen Raphael, a rich stockbroker who was a skilled <a href="backgammon">backgammon</a> player. They holidayed together in the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, went water-skiing, and played golf, backgammon and poker. Lucan became a regular gambler and an early member of <a href="John%20Aspinall%20%28zoo%20owner%29">John Aspinall</a>'s <a href="Clermont%20Club%23Clermont%20Club">Clermont gaming club</a>, located in <a href="Berkeley%20Square">Berkeley Square</a>. He often won at games of skill like bridge and backgammon, but he also accumulated huge losses. On one occasion he lost £8,000, or about two-thirds of the money he received annually from various family trusts. On another disastrous night at a casino he lost £10,000. That time his <a href="stockbroker">stockbroker</a> uncle by marriage, <a href="John%20Bevan%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Bevan</a>, helped him to pay the debt, and Lucan repaid his uncle two years later.

Lucan left Brandt's in about 1960, shortly after he had won £26,000 playing <a href="Baccarat%20%28card%20game%29%23Chemin%20de%20fer">chemin de fer</a>. A colleague had been promoted before him, and he protested and then gave up his job, saying "why should I work in a bank, when I can earn a year's money in one single night at the tables?" He travelled to the United States, where he played golf, raced powerboats, and drove his <a href="Aston%20Martin">Aston Martin</a> around the West Coast. He also visited his elder sister Jane, and his former guardian, Marcia Tucker. On his return to England he moved out of his parents' home in <a href="St%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJohn%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a> and into a flat in <a href="Park%20Crescent%2C%20London">Park Crescent</a>.

Lucan met his future wife, Veronica Duncan, early in 1963. She was born in 1937 to Major Charles Moorhouse Duncan and his wife, Thelma. Her father had died in a car accident while she was still very young, following which the family had moved to South Africa. Her mother remarried, and when her new step-father became manager of a hotel in <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a>, the family returned to England. Along with her sister, Christina, she was educated at <a href="St%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BSwithun%27s%20School%2C%20Winchester">St Swithun's School, Winchester</a>, and after displaying a talent for art she went on to study at an art college in <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>. The two sisters later shared a flat in London, where Veronica worked as a model and later as a secretary. Christina's marriage to the wealthy William Shand Kydd (half-brother to <a href="Peter%20Shand%20Kydd">Peter Shand Kydd</a>, stepfather to <a href="Princess%20Diana">Diana Spencer</a>, later Princess of Wales) introduced her to London <a href="high%20society%20%28group%29">high society</a>, and it was at a golf-club function in the country that Veronica and Lucan first met.

News of their engagement appeared in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" and "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" newspapers on 14 October 1963, and the two were married at <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Brompton%20Church">Holy Trinity Church, Brompton</a> on 20 November. After a ceremony attended by <a href="Princess%20Alice%2C%20Countess%20of%20Athlone">Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone</a> (one of whose ladies-in-waiting had been a relative of Lady Lucan), but by few other prominent members of high society, the couple honeymooned in Europe, travelling first class on the <a href="Orient%20Express">Orient Express</a>. Lucan's already embattled finances were given a welcome boost by his father, who provided him with a <a href="marriage%20settlement">marriage settlement</a> designed to finance a larger family home and any future additions to the Lucan family. Lucan repaid some of his creditors and purchased 46 Lower Belgrave Street, Belgravia, redecorating it to suit Veronica's tastes. Two months after the wedding, on 21 January 1964, the 6th Earl of Lucan died of a <a href="stroke">stroke</a>. In addition to a reputed £250,000 inheritance, Lucan acquired his father's titles: <a href="Earl%20of%20Lucan">Earl of Lucan</a>; Baron Lucan of <a href="Castlebar">Castlebar</a>; Baron Lucan of Melcombe Lucan and <a href="List%20of%20baronetcies%20in%20the%20Baronetage%20of%20Nova%20Scotia">Baronet Bingham of Castlebar</a>. His wife became the Countess of Lucan. Their first child, Frances, was born on 24 October 1964, and early the next year they employed a nanny, Lillian Jenkins, to look after her. Lucan tried to teach Veronica about gambling and traditional pursuits like hunting, shooting, and fishing. He bought her golf lessons; she later gave up the sport.

Lucan's daily routine consisted of breakfast at 9:00 am, coffee, dealing with the morning's letters, reading the newspapers, and playing the piano. He sometimes jogged in the park and took his <a href="Doberman%20Pinscher">Doberman Pinscher</a> for walks. Lunch at the Clermont Club was followed by afternoon games of backgammon. Returning home to change into <a href="black%20tie">evening dress</a>, the earl typically spent the remainder of the day at the Clermont, gambling into the early hours, watched sometimes by Veronica. In 1956, while still working at Brandt's, he had written of his desire to have "£2m in the bank", claiming that "motor-cars, yachts, expensive holidays, and security for the future would give myself and a lot of other people a lot of pleasure". He was described by his friends as a shy and taciturn man, but with his tall stature, "luxuriant guardsman's moustache," and masculine pursuits, his exploits made him popular. His profligacy extended to hiring private aircraft to take his friends to the races, asking a car dealer he knew to source an Aston Martin <a href="convertible%20%28car%29">drophead coupé</a>, drinking expensive Russian vodka and racing <a href="offshore%20powerboat%20racing">powerboats</a>. In September 1966 he unsuccessfully <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a>ed for a part in "<a href="Woman%20Times%20Seven">Woman Times Seven</a>", prompting him to decline a later offer from film producer <a href="Cubby%20Broccoli">Cubby Broccoli</a> to screen test him for the role of <a href="James%20Bond%20%28character%29">James Bond</a>.

As a professional gambler he was undoubtedly a skilled player, once rated amongst the world's top ten backgammon competitors. He won the <a href="St%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJames%27s%20Club">St James's Club</a> tournament and was Champion of the West Coast of America. He gained the moniker "Lucky" Lucan, but his losses easily outweighed his winnings, and in reality he was anything but lucky. He had interests in thoroughbred horses; in 1968 he paid more in race entry fees than he received in winnings. Despite some arguments over money, his wife remained largely ignorant of his losses, retaining the use of accounts at <a href="Savile%20Row">Savile Row</a> tailors and various <a href="Knightsbridge">Knightsbridge</a> shops. Following the births of <a href="George%20Bingham%2C%20Lord%20Bingham">George</a> (1967) and <a href="Lady%20Camilla%20Bloch">Camilla</a> (1970), she suffered <a href="post-natal%20depression">post-natal depression</a>. Lucan became increasingly involved in her mental well-being, and in 1971 took her for treatment at a psychiatric clinic in <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, where she refused to be admitted. Instead, she agreed to home visits from a psychiatrist and a course of anti-depressants. In July 1972 the family holidayed in <a href="Monte%20Carlo">Monte Carlo</a>, but Veronica quickly returned to England, leaving Lucan with their two elder children. The combined pressures of maintaining their finances, paying for Lucan's gambling addiction, and Veronica's weakened mental condition took their toll on the marriage; two weeks after a strained family Christmas in 1972, Lucan moved into a small property in Eaton Row.

Some months later Lucan moved again, to a larger rented flat in nearby Elizabeth Street. Despite an early attempt by his wife at reconciliation, by that point all Lucan wanted from the marriage was custody of his children. In an effort to demonstrate that Veronica was unfit to look after them, he began to spy on his family (his car was regularly seen parked in Lower Belgrave Street), later employing private investigators to perform the same task. Lucan also canvassed doctors, who explained that his wife had not "gone mad", but was suffering from depression and anxiety. Lucan told his friends that nobody would work for Veronica (she sacked the children's long-term nanny, Lillian Jenkins, in December 1972). Of the series of nannies employed in the house, one, 26-year-old Stefanja Sawicka, was told by Veronica that Lucan had hit her with a cane and had, on one occasion, pushed her down the stairs. The countess apparently feared for her safety and told Sawicka not to be surprised "if he kills me one day."

Sawicka's time at the Lucan household ended late in March 1973. While with two of the children near <a href="Grosvenor%20Place%20%28London%29">Grosvenor Place</a>, she was confronted by Lucan and two private detectives. They told her that the children had been made <a href="Ward%20%28law%29">wards of court</a> and that she must release them into his custody, which she did. Frances was collected from school later in the day. Lady Lucan applied to the court to have the children returned, but concerned about the case's complexity, the judge set a date for the hearing three months ahead, for June 1973. To defend herself against Lucan's claims about her mental state, Veronica booked herself a four-day stay at the <a href="Priory%20Clinic">Priory Clinic</a> in <a href="Roehampton">Roehampton</a>. While it was acknowledged that she still required some psychiatric support, the doctors reported that there was no indication that she was mentally ill. Lucan's case depended upon Veronica being unable to care for the children, but at the hearing, he was instead forced to defend his own behaviour toward her. After several weeks of witnesses and protracted arguments "<a href="in%20camera">in camera</a>", on the advice of his lawyers he conceded the case. Unimpressed by Lucan's character, Mr Justice Rees awarded custody to Veronica. The earl was allowed access every other weekend.

Thus began a bitter dispute between the two, involving many of their friends and Veronica's own sister. Lucan again began to watch his wife's movements. He recorded some of their telephone conversations with a small <a href="Sony">Sony</a> tape recorder and played excerpts to any friends prepared to listen; he also told them—and his bank manager—that Lady Lucan had been "spending money like water". He continued to pay her £40 a week and may have cancelled their regular food order with <a href="Harrods">Harrods</a>. He delayed payment to the milkman and—knowing that Veronica was required by the court to employ a live-in nanny—the childcare agency. With no income of her own, Veronica took a part-time job in a local hospital. A temporary nanny, Elizabeth Murphy, was befriended by Lucan, who bought her drinks and asked her for information on his wife. He instructed his detective agency to investigate Murphy, looking for evidence that she was failing in her duty of care to his children. This they found; he dispensed with the detective agency's services when they presented him with bills amounting to several hundred pounds. Murphy was later hospitalised with cancer. Another temporary nanny, Christabel Martin, reported strange telephone calls to the house, some with heavy breathing and some from a man asking for non-existent people. Following a series of temporary nannies, Sandra Rivett started work in late 1974.

Losing the court case proved devastating for Lucan. It had cost him an estimated £20,000, and by late 1974 his financial position was dire. As he drank more heavily and started chain-smoking, his friends began to worry. In drunken conversations with some of them, including Aspinall's mother, <a href="Sir%20George%20Osborne%2C%2016th%20Baronet">Lady Osborne</a>, and her son, Lucan discussed murdering his wife. <a href="Greville%20Howard%2C%20Baron%20Howard%20of%20Rising">Greville Howard</a> later gave a statement to the police describing how Lucan had talked of how killing his wife might save him from bankruptcy, how her body might be disposed of in the <a href="Solent">Solent</a> and how he "would never be caught". Lucan borrowed £4,000 from his mother and asked Marcia Tucker for a loan of £100,000. Having no luck there, he wrote to Tucker's son, explaining how he wished to "buy" his children from Veronica; the money was not forthcoming. He turned to his friends and acquaintances, asking anyone plausible to loan him money to fund his gambling addiction. The financier <a href="James%20Goldsmith">James Goldsmith</a> guaranteed a £5,000 overdraft for him, which for years remained unpaid. Lucan also applied to the discreet Edgware Trust. On request, he supplied details of his income, which was apparently around £12,000 a year from various family trusts. He was required to provide a <a href="surety">surety</a> and received only £3,000 of the £5,000 he asked for. Much to their managers' consternation, his four bank accounts were overdrawn; <a href="Coutts">Coutts</a>, £2,841; <a href="Lloyds%20Banking%20Group">Lloyds</a>, £4,379; <a href="National%20Westminster">National Westminster</a>, £1,290; <a href="Midland%20Bank">Midland</a>, £5,667. Even though by then he was playing for much lower stakes than had previously been the case, Lucan's gambling remained completely out of control. Ranson (1994) estimates that between September and October 1974 alone, the earl ran up debts of around £50,000. <a href="Taki%20Theodoracopulos">Taki Theodoracopulos</a>, who recalled Lucan as a close friend for more than a decade, lent him £3,000 in cash three nights before the murder.

Despite these problems, from late October 1974 his demeanour appeared to change for the better. His <a href="best%20man">best man</a>, John Wilbraham, remarked that Lucan's apparent obsession over regaining his children had diminished. While having dinner with his mother he cast aside talk of his family problems and turned instead to politics. On 6 November he met his uncle <a href="John%20Bevan%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Bevan</a>, apparently in good spirits. Later that day he met 21-year-old Charlotte Andrina Colquhoun, who said that "he seemed very happy, just his usual self, and there was nothing to suggest that he was worried or depressed". He also dined at the Clermont with racing driver <a href="Graham%20Hill">Graham Hill</a>. At the time, casinos could open only between 2:00 pm and 4:00 am, so Lucan often gambled into the early hours of the morning. He took tablets to deal with his insomnia and therefore usually awoke around lunchtime. On 7 November though, he broke routine and called his solicitor early that morning, and at 10:30 am took a call from Colquhoun. They arranged to eat at the Clermont at about 3:00 pm, but Lucan failed to appear. Colquhoun drove past the Clermont and Ladbroke clubs, and past Elizabeth Street, but could not find his car anywhere. Lucan also failed to arrive for his 1:00 pm lunch appointment with artist <a href="Dominic%20Elwes">Dominic Elwes</a> and banker Daniel Meinertzhagen, again at the Clermont.

At 4:00 pm Lucan called at a chemist's on Lower Belgrave Street, close to Veronica's home, and asked the pharmacist there to identify a small capsule. It turned out to be <a href="Limbitrol">Limbitrol</a> 5, a drug for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Lucan had apparently made several similar visits since he separated from his wife; he never told the pharmacist where he got the drugs. At 4:45 pm he called a friend, literary agent Michael Hicks-Beach, and between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm met with him at his flat on Elizabeth Street. Lucan wanted his help with an article on gambling he had been asked to write for an <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> magazine. He drove Hicks-Beach home at about 8:00 pm, not in his <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a>, but in "an old, dark, and scruffy Ford", possibly the <a href="Ford%20Corsair">Ford Corsair</a> he borrowed from Michael Stoop several weeks earlier. At 8:30 pm he called the Clermont to check on a reservation for dinner with Greville Howard and friends. Howard had called him at 5:15 pm and asked if he wished to come to the theatre, but Lucan had declined and made the alternative suggestion to meet at the Clermont at 11:00 pm. He failed to arrive and did not answer his telephone when called.

Sandra Eleanor Rivett was born on 16 September 1945, the third child of Albert and Eunice Hensby. The family moved to Australia when she was two years old, but returned in 1955. Sandra was a popular child, described at school as "intelligent, although she does not excel academically". She worked for six months as an apprentice hairdresser before taking a job as a secretary in <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a>. Following a failed romance she became a voluntary patient at a mental hospital near <a href="Redhill%2C%20Surrey">Redhill, Surrey</a>, where she was treated for depression. She became engaged to a builder named John and took a job as a children's nanny for a doctor in Croydon. On 13 March 1964, she gave birth to a boy named Stephen, but, as her relationship with John was failing, she returned home to live with her parents and considered giving the baby up for adoption. Her parents took on the responsibility and adopted him in May 1965. Sandra later worked at an old people's home, before moving to <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> to stay with her elder sister. While there she met Roger Rivett; the two married on 10 June 1967 in Croydon. Roger was serving as a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> able seaman and later worked as a loader for <a href="British%20Road%20Services">British Road Services</a>, while Sandra worked part-time at Reedham Orphanage in <a href="Purley%2C%20London">Purley</a>. In summer 1973 he took a job on an <a href="Esso">Esso</a> tanker, returning to their flat in <a href="Kenley">Kenley</a> a few months later by which time Sandra was employed by a cigarette company in Croydon. Their marriage collapsed in May 1974 when, suspicious of Sandra's movements while he was away, Roger went to live with his parents. She was by then listed on the books of a <a href="Belgravia">Belgravia</a> domestic agency and had been caring for an elderly couple in that district. A few weeks later she began to work for the Lucans.

Sandra normally went out with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00 pm on 7 November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55 pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned to death with a piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett from the top of the basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to "shut up." Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby <a href="public%20house">public house</a>, the <a href="Plumbers%20Arms%2C%20Belgravia">Plumbers Arms</a>.

Lucan may have arrived at the Chester Square home of Madelaine Florman (mother of one of Frances's school friends) sometime between 10:00 pm and 10:30 pm. Alone in the house, Florman ignored the door, but shortly afterwards she received an incoherent telephone call and put the receiver down. Blood stains, which after forensic examination were found to be a mixture of blood groups A and B, were later discovered on her doorstep. Lucan certainly called his mother between 10:30 pm and 11:00 pm and asked her to collect the children from Lower Belgrave Street. According to the Dowager Countess, he spoke of a "terrible catastrophe" at his wife's home. He told her that he had been driving past the house when he saw Veronica fighting with a man, in the basement. He had entered the property and found his wife screaming. The location from which he made this, and possibly the call to Florman, remains unknown. The police forced their way into Lady Lucan's home and discovered Sandra Rivett's body before his wife was taken by ambulance to <a href="St%20George%27s%20Hospital">St George's Hospital</a>. Lucan drove the Ford Corsair to <a href="Uckfield">Uckfield</a>, in <a href="East%20Sussex">East Sussex</a>, to visit his friends, the Maxwell-Scotts. Susan Maxwell-Scott's meeting with Lucan was his last confirmed sighting.

By the time <a href="Detective%20Chief%20Superintendent">Detective Chief Superintendent</a> Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8 November, the divisional surgeon had pronounced Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers had been called to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, there was no sign of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.

Officers also searched 5 Eaton Row, into which Lucan had moved early in 1973, and after interviewing his mother (who had called to take the children to her home in <a href="St%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJohn%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a>), his last address at 72a Elizabeth Street. Nothing untoward was found; on the bed, a suit and shirt lay alongside a book on Greek shipping millionaires, and Lucan's wallet, car keys, money, driving licence, handkerchief and <a href="glasses">spectacles</a> were on a bedside table. His passport was in a drawer and his blue Mercedes-Benz parked outside, its engine cold and its battery flat. Ranson then visited Veronica Lucan at St George's Hospital. Although heavily sedated, she was able to describe what had happened to her. A police officer was left to guard her, should her assailant return. Rivett's body was taken to the mortuary, and a search was undertaken of all local basement areas and gardens, skips and open spaces.

After removing her corpse from the canvas sack and beginning the <a href="post%20mortem">post mortem</a> examination, pathologist <a href="Keith%20Simpson%20%28pathologist%29">Keith Simpson</a> told Ranson he was certain that Rivett had been killed before her body was placed in the sack, and that in his opinion the lead pipe found at the scene could be the murder weapon. Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night concerned, and was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Her parents confirmed that Sandra had a good working relationship with Lady Lucan, and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.

Hours earlier, Lucan had again called his mother, at about 12:30 am. He told her that he would be in touch later that day, but declined to speak with the police constable who had accompanied her to her flat; instead, he said he would call the police later that morning. Ranson discovered that Lucan had travelled to Uckfield when he was called by Ian Maxwell-Scott, who told him that Lucan had arrived at his home a few hours after the murder, and spoken with his wife, Susan. While there, the earl had written two letters to his brother-in-law, Bill Shand Kydd, and posted them to his London address. Maxwell-Scott also called Shand Kydd at his country house near <a href="Leighton%20Buzzard">Leighton Buzzard</a> and told him about the letters, prompting the latter to immediately drive to London to collect them. After reading them, and noting that they were bloodstained, he took them to Ranson.

When asked why she did not immediately inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott said she had not seen any newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts that might have warned her of the importance of his visit. Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in <a href="Guilsborough">Guilsborough</a>, <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a>, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children could return to live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>.

The Ford Corsair that Lucan had been seen driving and whose details had the previous day been circulated across the country was found on Sunday in Norman Road, <a href="Newhaven%2C%20East%20Sussex">Newhaven</a>, about from Uckfield. In its <a href="Trunk%20%28automobile%29">boot</a> was a piece of lead pipe covered in surgical tape, and a full bottle of vodka. The car was removed for forensic examination. Later statements from two witnesses suggest that it was parked there sometime between 5:00 am and 8:00 am on the morning of Friday 8 November. Its owner, Michael Stoop, also received a letter from Lucan, delivered to his club, the St James's. However, Stoop threw the envelope away and it was therefore not possible to check its postmark to see where it had been sent from.

Ranson suspected a suicide, but a thorough search of Newhaven Downs was judged impossible. A partial search was made, using tracker dogs, but all that was found were the skeletal remains of a judge who had disappeared years earlier. Police divers searched the harbour, and a partial search using infrared photography was undertaken the following year, to no avail. A warrant for Lucan's arrest, to answer charges of murdering Sandra Rivett, and attempting to murder his wife, was issued on Tuesday 12 November 1974. Descriptions of his appearance, already issued to police forces across the UK, were then issued to <a href="Interpol">Interpol</a>.

The forensic examination of the lead pipes found at the murder scene and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46 Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (<a href="Blood%20type">blood group</a> A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no blood on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.

An examination of the blood stains found inside 46 Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked at the top of the basement stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the <a href="ABO%20blood%20group%20system">AB blood group</a>; the report concluded that this might have been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.

By the afternoon of Friday 8 November, the newspapers' early editions carried photographs of the Lucans across their front pages, accompanied by headlines like "Body in sack ... countess runs out screaming", and "Belgravia murder – earl sought". A meeting that day at the Clermont, between John Aspinall, Daniel Meinertzhagen, Charles Benson, Stephen Raphael, Bill Shand Kydd, and <a href="Dominick%20Elwes">Dominick Elwes</a>, became the cause of much press speculation. Meinertzhagen and Raphael later insisted that the gathering was just a rational discussion between concerned friends, keen to share anything they knew about what had happened, but the relationship between the police and Lucan's social circle was strained; some officers complained that an "Eton mafia" worked against them. Susan Maxwell-Scott refused to add to her statement, and when Aspinall's mother, Lady Osborne, was asked if she could help locate Lucan's body, she replied "The last I heard of him, he was being fed to the tigers at my son's zoo", prompting the police to search the house and the animal cages there. They searched fourteen country houses and estates, including <a href="Holkham%20Hall">Holkham Hall</a> and <a href="Warwick%20Castle">Warwick Castle</a>, to no avail. Amidst concerns expressed by the Labour MP <a href="Marcus%20Lipton">Marcus Lipton</a> that some people were "being a bit snooty" with the police, Benson wrote a letter to "The Times" asking him to either identify those people or "kindly withdraw his remarks". To their cost, "<a href="Private%20Eye">Private Eye</a>" accused <a href="James%20Goldsmith">James Goldsmith</a> of being at the Clermont meeting, when he was actually in Ireland. Dominic Elwes went to see Lady Lucan in hospital and was reportedly deeply shocked both by her appearance and her statement "Who's the mad one now?" Elwes was apparently unhappy at some of the negative press coverage of the countess, and was later ostracised by his friends for his part in an article critical of Lucan, which appeared in the "Sunday Times Magazine". He committed suicide in September 1975.

Rivett's case made headlines around the world. Within days of the murder, newspapers reported on Veronica Lucan's statement to the police, with claims that she had pretended to collude with her husband to ensure her safety. In January 1975 Veronica gave an exclusive interview to the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>". She also appeared in a murder reconstruction, in the same newspaper, complete with posed photographs taken inside the house.

The <a href="Inquests%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">inquest</a> into Sandra Rivett's death opened on 13 November 1974 and was led by the Coroner for Inner West London, Gavin Thurston. Two witnesses were called to the courtroom, which was packed with reporters; Roger Rivett, who confirmed that he had identified his wife's body, and the pathologist, Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett had died from being hit on the head with a blunt instrument. At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned. Further adjournments were made on 11 December 1974 and 10 March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16 June 1975.

The hearing began with introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33 witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened on the night of the attack. The Dowager Countess's <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">Queen's Counsel</a> attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. <a href="Detective%20constable%23United%20Kingdom%20and%20the%20Commonwealth">Woman Detective Constable</a> Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20 November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.

The landlord of The Plumbers Arms described how Lady Lucan had entered his bar covered "head to toe in blood" before she fell into "a state of shock". He claimed that she shouted "Help me, help me, I've just escaped from being murdered" and "My children, my children, he's murdered my nanny". Pathologist <a href="Keith%20Simpson%20%28pathologist%29">Keith Simpson</a> outlined his post-mortem examination, concluding that death was caused by "blunt head injuries" and "inhalation of blood". He confirmed that the lead pipe found at the scene was most likely responsible for Rivett's injuries; some, to the left eye and mouth, he thought more likely to have been caused by punches from a clenched fist. The last person to confirm seeing Lucan alive, Susan Maxwell-Scott, told the court that the earl looked "dishevelled", and his hair "a little ruffled". His trousers had a damp patch on the right hip. Lucan had told her that he was walking, or passing by the house when he saw Veronica being attacked by a man. He let himself in but slipped in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs. He told Maxwell-Scott that the attacker ran off, and that Veronica was "very hysterical" and accused him of having hired a hitman to kill her.
Once the hearing had ended, Thurston made a summary of the evidence presented and told the jury their options. At 11:45 am, their foreman announced "Murder by Lord Lucan". Lucan became the first member of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> to be named a murderer since 1760, when <a href="Laurence%20Shirley%2C%204th%20Earl%20Ferrers">Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers</a>, was hanged for killing his bailiff. He was also the last person to be committed by a coroner to a Crown Court for unlawful killing; the coroner's power to do so was removed by the <a href="Criminal%20Law%20Act%201977">Criminal Law Act 1977</a>.

Rivett's body, which had been held for several weeks following the murder, was released to her family and cremated at <a href="Croydon%20Cemetery">Croydon crematorium</a> on 18 December 1974. A police spokesman cited Lady Lucan's desire not to upset the family as a reason for her non-attendance at the cremation.

Lucan's friends and family were critical of the inquest, which they felt offered a one-sided view of events. His mother told reporters that it did not serve "any useful purpose at all". Veronica's sister, Christina, said that she felt "great sadness and sorrow" at the verdict. Susan Maxwell-Scott continued to press the earl's claims of innocence and claimed to feel "awfully sorry" for the countess.

However, as Lucan remained absent, his description of "a traumatic night of unbelievable coincidence" came only from the letters he authored and the people he spoke with soon after Rivett's murder. While his fingerprints were not found at the scene, his assertions make no provision for the lead pipe discovered in the boot of the Ford Corsair, the claims by some that he discussed murdering his wife, or the lack of a viable suspect for the man he claimed to have seen fighting her. No sign of a forced entry was found, and officers attempting to demonstrate that Lucan could have seen into the basement kitchen, from the street, could only do so by stooping low to the pavement. The basement light was not working, making it even more difficult to see into the room; its lightbulb (which was tested and found to be in working order) was found removed from its holder and left lying on a chair. Furthermore, Lady Lucan claimed not to have entered the basement that night, contradicting the earl's version of events; his wife's account is supported by the forensic examination made of the blood splashes and stains around the property. Some traces of her blood were found in the basement, the rear garden and on the canvas sack used to store Rivett's body; this may have been due to contamination at the scene. The man Lucan claimed to have seen could not have left through the basement's front door as it was locked, and the rear door led to a walled garden through which no trace of an escape was found. No signs that the man left by the ground level front door were discovered, and no witnesses reported seeing any such person near 46 Lower Belgrave Street.

In contrast to his defenders, the <a href="Media%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">national press</a> were almost unanimous in their condemnation of Lucan. Their <a href="Editorial">leader</a>-writers ignored the threat of <a href="English%20defamation%20law">libel</a> and identified him as Rivett's killer.

As Lucan's <a href="Bankruptcy%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">bankruptcy</a> proceeded, in August 1975 his creditors were informed that the missing earl had unsecured debts of £45,000 and preferential liabilities for £1,326. His assets were estimated at £22,632. The <a href="Silver%20%28household%29">family silver</a> was sold in March 1976 for around £30,000. His remaining debts were repaid by the Lucan family trust in the years immediately following his disappearance. His family was granted <a href="probate">probate</a> over his estate in 1999, but no death certificate was issued, and his heir, <a href="George%20Bingham%2C%20Lord%20Bingham">George Bingham, Lord Bingham</a>, was refused permission to take his father's title and seat in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. Following the passage of the <a href="Presumption%20of%20Death%20Act%202013">Presumption of Death Act 2013</a>, Bingham began a new attempt to have his father declared dead, which proved successful in a <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a> hearing at the <a href="Rolls%20Building">Rolls Building</a> on 3 February 2016. He therefore inherited his father's title, becoming the 8th Earl of Lucan.

The last confirmed sighting of Lucan was at about 1:15 am on 8 November 1974 as he exited the driveway of the Maxwell-Scott property, in his friend's Ford Corsair. Since then, his whereabouts and ultimate fate remain a mystery. Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson initially claimed that Lucan had "done the honourable thing" and "fallen on his own sword", a view publicly repeated by many of Lucan's friends, including John Aspinall, who shortly before his death in 2000 said he believed the earl was guilty of Rivett's murder, and that he had committed <a href="suicide">suicide</a> by scuttling his motorboat and jumping into the <a href="English%20Channel">Channel</a> with a stone tied around his body. Veronica Lucan, who committed suicide in 2017, believed her husband had killed himself "like the nobleman he was".

Ranson later changed his view, explaining that he considered it more likely that suicide was far from Lucan's thoughts, that a rumoured drowning at sea was implausible and that the earl had moved to southern Africa. Thirty years after the murder, the detective leading a new investigation into Lucan's disappearance told the "Telegraph" that "the evidence points towards the fact that Lord Lucan left the country and lived abroad for a number of years". Speaking to author <a href="John%20Pearson%20%28author%29">John Pearson</a> before she died, Susan Maxwell-Scott suggested that Lucan might have been helped out of the country by shadowy underground financiers, before being judged too great a risk and killed and buried in Switzerland. A similar theory was proposed by advertising executive Jeremy Scott, who was familiar with some of the <a href="Clermont%20Set">Clermont Set</a>.

Lucan's disappearance has captivated the public's imagination for decades, with thousands of sightings reported across the world. One of the earliest, shortly after the murder, turned out to be a British ex-politician, <a href="John%20Stonehouse">John Stonehouse</a>, who had attempted to fake his own death. The police travelled to France in June the following year to hunt another lead, to no avail. A sighting in Colombia turned out to be an American businessman. John Miller, a bounty hunter who kidnapped the fugitive <a href="Great%20Train%20Robbery%20%281963%29">train robber</a> <a href="Ronnie%20Biggs">Ronnie Biggs</a>, claimed in 1982 to have captured the earl, but was later exposed by the "<a href="News%20of%20the%20World">News of the World</a>" as a hoaxer. In 2003 a former <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a> detective thought he had tracked the earl to <a href="Goa">Goa</a>, India; the man he traced was actually Barry Halpin, a folk singer from <a href="St%20Helens%2C%20Merseyside">St Helens</a>. In 2007, reporters in New Zealand interviewed a homeless British expatriate who neighbours claimed was the missing earl.

More recently, responding to claims that the two eldest Lucan children were sent to <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a> in the early 1980s so that their father might secretly watch them "from a distance", George Bingham denied ever visiting the country. Veronica Lucan dismissed the newspaper claims of sightings as "nonsense", reiterating that in her opinion her husband "was not the sort of Englishman to cope abroad".

Myst is a <a href="Graphic%20adventure%20game">graphic adventure</a> <a href="puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle video game</a> designed by the Miller brothers, <a href="Robyn%20Miller">Robyn</a> and <a href="Rand%20Miller">Rand</a>. It was developed by <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan, Inc.</a>, published by <a href="Br%C3%B8derbund">Brøderbund</a>, and released as a <a href="PC%20game">PC game</a> for the <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> platform in 1993. In the game, players are told that a special book has caused them to travel to Myst Island. There, players solve puzzles and, by doing so, travel to four other worlds, known as "Ages", which reveal the backstory of the game's characters.

After the development of several games aimed at children, the Miller brothers conceived of "Myst" as a game for adults. Development began in 1991 and was Cyan's biggest undertaking to date. Technical constraints of the time influenced the design of the game and the production of its graphics, which were state-of-the-art but static. Robyn Miller ended up composing 40 minutes of <a href="Synthesizer%20%28music%29">synthesized music</a> that became the soundtrack to "Myst".

"Myst" was a surprise hit, with critics lauding the ability of the game to immerse players in its fictional world. The game was the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20PC%20video%20games">best-selling PC game</a> for a time, until "<a href="The%20Sims%20%28video%20game%29">The Sims</a>" exceeded its sales in 2002. Multiple <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remakes</a> and <a href="porting">ports</a> of the game to other platforms have been released, and "Myst" helped drive adoption of the then-nascent <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> format. Its success not only spawned numerous ports, but sequels, remakes, and spin-off novels and media.

"Myst"s gameplay consists of a <a href="first-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> journey through an interactive world. Players can interact with specific objects on some screens by <a href="Point-and-click">clicking</a> or dragging them. The player moves by clicking on locations shown on the screen; the scene then crossfades into another frame, and the player can explore the new area. "Myst" has an optional "Zip" feature to assist in rapidly crossing areas already explored; when a lightning bolt cursor appears, players can click and skip several frames to another location. While this provides a rapid method of travel, it can also cause players to miss important items and clues. Some items can be carried by the player and read, including journal pages which provide <a href="Back-story">backstory</a>. Players can only carry a single page at a time, and pages return to their original locations when dropped.

To complete the game, the player must explore the island of Myst. There the player discovers and follows clues to be transported via "linking books" to several "Ages", each of which is a self-contained mini-world. Each of the Ages—named Selenitic, Stoneship, Mechanical, and Channelwood—requires the user to solve a series of logical, interrelated puzzles to complete its exploration. Objects and information discovered in one Age may be required to solve puzzles in another Age, or to complete the game's primary puzzle on Myst. For example, in order to activate a switch, players must first discover a combination to a safe, open it, and use the matches found within to start a boiler.

Apart from its predominantly nonverbal storytelling, "Myst"s gameplay is unusual among adventuring computer games in several ways. The player is provided with very little backstory at the beginning of the game, and no obvious goals or objectives are laid out. This means that players must simply begin to explore. There are no obvious enemies, <a href="nonviolent%20video%20game">no physical violence</a>, no time limit to complete the game, and no threat of dying at any point. The game unfolds at its own pace and is solved through a combination of patience, observation, and logical thinking.

Players assume the role of an unnamed person who stumbles across an unusual book titled "Myst". The player reads the book and discovers a detailed description of an island world called Myst. Placing his or her hand on the last page, the player is whisked away to the world described and is left with no choice but to explore the island. Myst contains a library where two additional books can be found, colored red and blue. These books are traps that hold <a href="Sirrus%20and%20Achenar">Sirrus and Achenar</a>, the sons of <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Atrus">Atrus</a>, who once lived on Myst island with his wife Catherine. Atrus writes special "linking books" that transport people to the worlds, or "Ages", that the books describe. From the panels of their books, Sirrus and Achenar tell the player that Atrus is dead; each brother blames the other for the death of their father, as well as the destruction of much of Atrus' library. Both plead for help to escape. The books are missing several pages, rendering the sons' messages unclear and riddled with static.

As the player continues to explore the island, books linking to more Ages are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. The player must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and return to Myst Island. These pages can then be placed in the corresponding books. As the player adds more pages to these books, the brothers can be seen and heard more clearly. After collecting four pages, the brothers can talk clearly enough to tell the player where the fifth and final missing page for their book is hidden; if the player can complete either book, that brother will be set free. The clearer dialog also allows the player to more accurately judge each brother's personality. The player is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.

Sirrus and Achenar beg the player not to touch the green book that is stored in the same location as their final pages, claiming it to be another trap book like their own. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the player to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the player to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the player and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.

In 1988, brothers Rand and Robyn Miller were living apart in the United States. Robyn was taking a year off from university, writing and trying to establish state residency. Rand was a computer programmer for a bank. Rand approached his brother with the idea of making an interactive storybook using <a href="HyperCard">HyperCard</a>. The brothers were not big video game players themselves, although they were familiar with "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>", and had played "<a href="Zork">Zork</a>". In his parents' basement—Robyn did not own a computer himself—Robyn began drawing pictures and creating a nonlinear story that would eventually become their first game, "<a href="The%20Manhole">The Manhole</a>". "The Manhole" and the games that followed—"<a href="Cosmic%20Osmo%20and%20the%20Worlds%20Beyond%20the%20Mackerel">Cosmic Osmo</a>" and "<a href="Spelunx">Spelunx</a>"—were specifically aimed at children and shared the same aesthetics: black-and-white graphics, point-and-click gameplay, a first-person point of view, and explorable worlds. Robyn recalled that the games were more about exploration than narrative: "In the projects we did for children, we didn't really tell stories ... They were just these worlds that you would explore."

Around 1990, the brothers decided to create a game that would appeal to adults. Among their goals were believable characters, a non-linear story, and for the player as protagonist to make ethical choices. The Millers pitched the game to <a href="Activision">Activision</a> under the title "The Gray Summons"; Robyn recalled that Activision told them to stick to children's games. At the time of the rejection, they were not doing well financially—"we were eating rice and beans and <a href="government%20cheese">government cheese</a> and that [was] our diet." Facing the end of their game-producing career, <a href="Sunsoft">Sunsoft</a> approached the Millers to create an adult-oriented game. Like with "The Gray Summons", the Millers wanted their game to have a non-linear story with believable characters and an ethical choice. They also wanted to produce a game with far more impressive graphics than their previous efforts—at one point they considered making the game entirely hand-drawn. Finally, they knew their story would be a mystery.

Development of "Myst" began in 1991. The game's creative team consisted of brothers Rand and Robyn, with help from sound designer Chris Brandkamp, 3D artist and animator Chuck Carter, Richard Watson, Bonnie McDowall, and Ryan Miller, who together made up <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan, Inc.</a> "Myst" was the largest and most time-consuming collaboration Cyan had attempted at that point. Cyan took inspiration from games like "Zork", "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" mythic universe, portals to other worlds like in <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>' "<a href="The%20Chronicles%20of%20Narnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>", and the mysterious islands of old literature like the works of <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>. The game's name, as well as the overall solitary and mysterious atmosphere of the island, was inspired by the book "<a href="The%20Mysterious%20Island">The Mysterious Island</a>" by Verne.

Sunsoft was not interested in the game for PC and was instead focused on the video game console market. At the time, consoles had no hard drives and small memory buffers, meaning the game had to be designed around these technical constraints. To solve this issue, they compartmentalized parts of the game's environments into the different Ages. The Millers decided that most people did not like puzzles. Thus, a good puzzle would feel familiar and part of the world—"not like a puzzle", but something for players to figure out like a circuit breaker in their house, using observation and common sense. Cyan did not have fans to please, and did not know exactly who the game would appeal to; Robyn felt like they did not have to second-guess their choices and could "explore the world as we were designing" and build a game for themselves. In a 2016 interview, Rand Miller stated that they strived to design the puzzles in "Myst" and their subsequent games by trying to balance three aspects: the puzzles themselves, the environment, and the story. Rand also stated they wanted to make sure that clues to the solutions to puzzles were apparent and presented to the player in a manner for these connections to be made: "once the player finds the solution, if they blame us, then we haven't done a good job. But if they blame themselves, then we have."

Cyan proposed "Myst" to Sunsoft for $265,000—more than double what they thought it would cost to develop the game, but ultimately less than "Myst" cost to produce. After getting the go-ahead, Cyan playtested the entire game in a role-played "Dungeons and Dragons" form to identify any large issues before entering full production.

"Myst" was not only the largest collaboration Cyan had attempted at the time, but also took the longest to develop. According to Rand Miller, the brothers spent months solely designing the look and puzzles of the Ages, which were influenced by earlier whimsical "worlds" made for children. Much of the early development time was spent devising puzzles and the Ages, and the story was secondary. "We were place designers ... and the maps kind of fueled the story," Rand said. The plot evolved in tandem with the changing environment, developing new story details with each new building in the world. The climactic ending with Atrus was a later development in the game's story after Cyan realized they wanted to create a more complicated ending. In retrospect, Robyn felt that "Myst" did not quite provoke the emotional reaction and ethical quandary they set out to create.

When Cyan began development, developing believable characters was a major hurdle. The brothers were limited to one-way communication with the player, and at any point, a player could choose to walk away and "break the spell" of the game. Displaying video in the game was initially infeasible. Designing around the limits, the designers created the trap books, which were location-specific, one-way communication devices. The release of <a href="QuickTime">QuickTime</a> halfway through development of the game solved the video issue.

At first, the developers had no idea how they would actually create the physical terrain for the Ages. Eventually, they created grayscale <a href="heightmap">heightmap</a>s, extruding them to create changes in elevation. From this basic terrain, textures were painted onto a colormap which was wrapped around the landscapes. Objects such as trees were added to complete the design. Rand noted that attention to detail allowed "Myst" to deal with the limitations of CD-ROM drives and graphics, stating "A lot can be done with texture ... Like finding an interesting texture you can map into the tapestry on the wall, spending a little extra time to actually put the bumps on the tapestry, putting screws in things. These are the things you don't necessarily notice, but if they weren't there, would flag to your subconscious that this is fake."

The game was created on <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers, principally <a href="Macintosh%20Quadra">Macintosh Quadra</a>s. The graphics were individual shots of fully rendered rooms. Overall, "Myst" contains 2,500 frames, one for each possible area the player can explore. Each scene was modeled and rendered in <a href="StrataVision%203D">StrataVision 3D</a>, with some additional modeling in <a href="Macromedia">Macromedia</a> MacroModel. The images were then edited and enhanced using <a href="Adobe%20Photoshop">Photoshop</a> 1.0.

The original Macintosh version of "Myst" was constructed in <a href="HyperCard">HyperCard</a>. Each Age was a unique HyperCard stack. Navigation was handled by the internal button system and <a href="HyperTalk">HyperTalk</a> scripts, with image and <a href="QuickTime">QuickTime</a> movie display passed off to various plugins; essentially, "Myst" functions as a series of separate multimedia slides linked together by commands. As the main technical constraint that impacted "Myst" was slow <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> drive read speeds, Cyan had to go to great lengths to make sure all the game elements loaded as quickly as possible. Images were stored as 8-bit <a href="PICT">PICT</a> resources with custom color palettes and QuickTime still image compression. Animated elements such as movies and object animations were encoded as QuickTime movies with <a href="Cinepak">Cinepak</a> compression; in total, there were more than 66 minutes of Quicktime animation. This careful processing made the finished graphics look like <a href="True%20Color">truecolor</a> images despite their low bit depth; the stills were reduced in size from 500 <a href="kilobyte">KB</a> to around 80 KB.

Cyan playtested the game with two people sitting in front of the game, finding that they would converse with each other and vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and to craft a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually, they included a <a href="saved%20game">save system</a> as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that "Myst" initially had no <a href="inciting%20incident">inciting incident</a>. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.

Chris Brandkamp produced most of the <a href="Ambient%20noise%20level">ambient</a> and incidental sounds in the game. To make sure the sounds fit, Brandkamp had to wait until the game's visuals were placed in context. Sound effects were drawn from unlikely sources; the noise of a fire in a boiler was created by driving slowly over stones in a driveway because recordings of actual fire did not sound like fire burning. The chimes of a large clock tower were simulated using a wrench, then transposed to a lower pitch.

At first, "Myst" had no music, because the Millers did not want music to interfere with the gameplay. After a few tests, they realized that the background music did not adversely affect the game and, in fact, "seemed to really help the mood of certain places that you were at in the game." Robyn Miller ended up composing 40 minutes of <a href="Synthesizer">synthesized</a> music that was used in the game and later published as "Myst: The Soundtrack". Mixing and effects were done on an <a href="E-mu%20Systems">E-mu</a> <a href="E-mu%20Proteus">Proteus MPS</a> synthesizer. The soundtrack was recorded over the course of two weeks' evenings. Initially, Cyan released the soundtrack via a mail-order service, but before the release of "Myst"s sequel, "<a href="Riven">Riven</a>", <a href="Virgin%20Records">Virgin Records</a> acquired the rights to release the soundtrack, and the CD was re-released on April 21, 1998.

The PC version of "Myst" holds an average score of 83% at <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> based on 7 reviews, although the subsequent remakes of the game and the console ports have generally received lower average scores.

"Myst" was generally praised by critics. "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" assured its readers that the game was not like other CD-ROM games that were "high on glitz and low on substance ... "Myst" is everything it's touted to be and is, quite simply, the best [Macintosh] CD-ROM game". It praised the game's <a href="open-world">open-world</a> nature, lack of death, and "straightforward and simple" storyline. The magazine stated that the "mesmerizing" and "stunning" graphics and sound were "not the star of the show ... the substance of the game is every bit as good as its packaging", and concluded that "Myst" "is bound to set a new standard". In April 1994, the magazine called it an "artistic masterwork".

"<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" were among the publications that pointed to "Myst" as evidence that video games could, in fact, evolve into an art form. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" reported that some players considered "Myst"s "virtual morality" a religious experience. <a href="Aarhus%20University">Aarhus University</a> professor Søren Pold pointed to "Myst" as an excellent example of how stories can be told using objects rather than people. Laura Evenson, writing for the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>", pointed to adult-oriented games like "Myst" as evidence the video game industry was emerging from its "adolescent" phase.

<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Jeff Sengstack wrote that ""Myst" is an immersive experience that draws you in and won't let you go." Writing about "Myst"s reception, Greg M. Smith noted that "Myst" had become a hit and was regarded as incredibly immersive despite most closely resembling "the hoary technology of the <a href="slideshow">slideshow</a> (with accompanying music and effects)". Smith concluded that ""Myst"s primary brilliance lies in the way it provides narrative justification for the very things that are most annoying" about the technological constraints imposed on the game; for instance, "<a href="Macworld">Macworld</a>" praised "Myst"s designers for overcoming the occasionally debilitating slowness of CD drives to deliver a consistent experience throughout the game. The publication went on to declare "Myst" the best game of 1994, stating that "Myst" removed the "most annoying parts of adventure games — vocabularies that [you] don't understand, people you can't talk to, wrong moves that get you killed and make you start over. You try to unravel the enigma of the island by exploring the island, but there's no time pressure to distract you, no arbitrary punishments put in your way".

Some aspects of the game still received criticism. Several publications did not agree with the positive reception of the story; Jeremy Parish of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> noted that while "Myst"s lack of interaction and continual plot suited the game, it helped usher in the death of the adventure game genre. "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" stated the main flaw with the game was that the game engine was nowhere near as sophisticated as the graphics. Heidi Fournier of "<a href="Adventure%20Gamers">Adventure Gamers</a>" noted a few critics complained about the difficulty and lack of context of the puzzles, while others believed these elements added to the gameplay. Similarly, critics were split on whether the lack of a plot the player could actually change was a good or bad element. In 1996 "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" called it "gaming's bleakest hour", saying the static graphics and purely trial-and-error puzzles epitomized poor game design. They said "Myst"s commercial success, which they owed chiefly to its popularity among non-gamers as a CD-ROM showcase, had led to many other games emulating its negative aspects. In a 2000 retrospective review, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> declared that "Myst" had not aged well and that playing it "was like watching hit TV shows from the 70s. 'People watched that?,' you wonder in horror."

"Myst" was named Best Adventure/Fantasy Role-Playing Game at the 1994 <a href="Software%20and%20Information%20Industry%20Association%23CODiE%20Awards">Codie award</a>s, and received an honorable mention in "<a href="GamePro%23PC%20Games">Electronic Entertainment</a>"s 1993 "Breakthrough Game" category, which ultimately went to "<a href="The%207th%20Guest">The 7th Guest</a>". That magazine's editors wrote, "One of the best-looking, best-sounding games ever, the Macintosh version of "Myst" sets new standards for the effective use of CD-ROM." "Myst" was also a runner-up for "Computer Gaming World"s 1993 "Adventure Game of the Year" award, but lost to "" and "<a href="Day%20of%20the%20Tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a>" (tie). In 1996, the magazine ranked "Myst" 11th on its list of the most innovative computer games.

Reviews for the game's console ports generally reflected each critic's attitude towards the original game, as critics agreed that the ports for 3DO, Saturn, and PlayStation are virtually identical to the PC original. For example, Sushi-X of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" gave the 3DO version a 5 out of 10, remarking "The graphics and sounds are decent but the game never really appealed to me on the PC", while his co-reviewer Danyon Carpenter gave it a 7 out of 10 and assessed that "This game was all the rage when it debuted on the PC, and that excitement should follow through on the 3DO." In one of the more enthusiastic reviews for "Myst", "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" gave the 3DO version a perfect 5 out of 5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and funfactor), concluding, "Beautiful and enchanting, "Myst" will thrill you and make you think at the same time." The Jaguar CD version was largely ignored by reviewers, but "GamePro" commented that apart from the Jaguar CD's lack of a mouse peripheral and occasionally longer load times, this version too is identical to the PC original.

However, the 3DS version received negative reviews even from critics who felt that "Myst"s popularity was merited, citing graphics and audio well below the 3DS's capabilities and the use of awkward circle pad controls in lieu of the 3DS's touchscreen.

"Myst" was an immense commercial success. Along with "<a href="The%207th%20Guest">The 7th Guest</a>", it was widely regarded as a <a href="killer%20application">killer application</a> that accelerated the sales of CD-ROM drives. By November 2000, it had sold above 6.3 million units worldwide, including more than 4.3 million in the United States. The game's success also led to a number of games which sought to copy "Myst"s success, referred to as ""Myst" clones". "Myst" was the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20video%20games">bestselling PC game</a> throughout the 1990s until "<a href="The%20Sims%20%28video%20game%29">The Sims</a>" exceeded its sales in 2002. "Myst"s success baffled some, who wondered how a game that was seen as "little more than 'an interactive slide show'" turned out to be a hit. Some developers of adventure games concurrent to "Myst"s release were somewhat critical of its success due to the number of subsequent video games that copied "Myst"s style compared to traditional adventure games, which diluted the market with poorly-received clones and which contributed to the waning popularity of the adventure game genre by 2000. Others criticized "Myst" as the "ultimate anti-arcade game", as it was much more relaxed and casual than anything that was released before since 1972, since "there were no lives, no dying, no score, and no time limit. No physical agility or reflexes were required. The only pressure was that which you imposed upon yourself to solve the puzzles and complete the storyline."

In addition to the numerous remakes and ports of the game, "Myst"s success led to several sequels. "<a href="Riven">Riven</a>" was released on October 29, 1997, in which Atrus asks the player to return to help him rescue his wife from <a href="Gehn%20%28D%27ni%29">Gehn</a>. "" was released simultaneously for Macintosh and Windows systems in North America on May 7, 2001, and was later ported to the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> consoles. "Exile" was not developed by Cyan; <a href="Presto%20Studios">Presto Studios</a> developed the title and <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> published it. Taking place 10 years after the events of "Riven", "Exile" reveals the reasons for Atrus' sons being imprisoned and the disastrous effects their greed caused. The fourth entry in the series, "", was released on September 10, 2004, and was developed and published entirely by Ubisoft. The music was composed by <a href="Jack%20Wall%20%28composer%29">Jack Wall</a> with assistance from <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>. The final game in the "Myst" saga was "", developed by <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> and released on September 19, 2005.

In addition to the main "Myst" <a href="saga">saga</a>, Cyan developed "", which was released on November 14, 2003. "Uru" allows players to customize their <a href="Avatar%20%28computing%29">avatars</a> and renders graphics in real-time. The multiplayer component of "Uru" was initially canceled, but <a href="GameTap">GameTap</a> eventually revived it as "", which was in turn canceled. The game was later resurrected as an open source title. The newest and current iteration of online "Uru" was made open source, and various fan-made Ages have been created. In the mid 1990s the Miller brothers collaborated with <a href="David%20Wingrove">David Wingrove</a>, writing several novels based on the "Myst" universe, which were published by <a href="Hyperion%20Books">Hyperion</a>. The novels, entitled "Myst: The Book of Atrus", "Myst: The Book of Ti'ana", and "Myst: The Book of D'ni", fill in the games' backstory and were packaged together as "<a href="The%20Myst%20Reader">The Myst Reader</a>".

By 2003, the <a href="Myst%20%28series%29">"Myst" franchise</a> had sold over twelve million copies worldwide, with "Myst" representing more than six million copies in the figure. The game was the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20PC%20video%20games">best-selling PC game</a> until "<a href="The%20Sims%20%28video%20game%29">The Sims</a>" exceeded its sales in . "Myst" was added to <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20in%20the%20Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">the collection of video games</a> of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> in 2013, where it is displayed as a video presentation.

The game's popularity has led to several mentions in popular culture. References to "Myst" made appearances in an episode of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" ("<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20VI">Treehouse of Horror VI</a>"), and <a href="Matt%20Damon">Matt Damon</a> wanted "<a href="Robert%20Ludlum%27s%20The%20Bourne%20Conspiracy">The Bourne Conspiracy</a>" video game to be a puzzle game like "Myst", refusing to lend his voice talent to the game when it was turned into a shooter instead. "Myst" has also been used for educational and scientific purposes; <a href="Becta">Becta</a> recognized a primary school teacher, Tim Rylands, who had made literacy gains using "Myst" as a teaching tool, and researchers have used the game for studies examining the effect of video games on aggression. A parody computer game, "<a href="Pyst">Pyst</a>", was released in 1996; the game is a satirical free roam of Myst island which had been apparently vandalized by frustrated visitors.

In retrospective, "Myst" is considered to be a precursor to <a href="casual%20game">casual game</a>s that gained popularity with browser platforms and mobile devices which typically do not require players to act quickly, as well as a preliminary example of a <a href="walking%20simulator">walking simulator</a> that allow players to explore and discover the game's narrative at their own pace. Cyan's sequels to "Myst" also indirectly served to popularize <a href="escape%20the%20room">escape the room</a> games, which provide similar puzzle-solving experiences but in a much more confined space.

<a href="Disney">Disney</a> approached Cyan Worlds about constructing a <a href="theme%20park">theme park</a> inspired by "Myst", which included scouting an island area within Disney's Florida properties that Rand Miller felt was perfect for the "Myst" setting. The television streaming service <a href="Hulu">Hulu</a> has obtained the rights to create a television series around "Myst" in May 2015. The series would explore the origin of the main island featured in "Myst". The series is being produced by <a href="Legendary%20Pictures">Legendary Television</a>, which had acquired the television rights from Cyan for the series in late 2014. The show will be produced by <a href="Matt%20Tolmach">Matt Tolmach</a> and written by <a href="Evan%20Daugherty">Evan Daugherty</a>. Rand Miller stated in a September 2016 interview that with the show, "we're farther along now than we've been in a long time", but timelines remain uncertain.

"Myst"s success led to the game being ported to multiple platforms, including the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Saturn</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>, <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a>, <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a>, <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a>, <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>, <a href="Atari%20Jaguar%20CD">Jaguar CD</a>, <a href="AmigaOS">AmigaOS</a>, <a href="CD-i">CD-i</a>, and <a href="3DO%20Interactive%20Multiplayer">3DO</a> consoles. There was also a version developed and even previewed for the <a href="Sega%20CD">Sega CD</a>, but it was never released by Sunsoft.

"Myst: Masterpiece Edition" was an updated version of the original "Myst", released in May 2000. It featured several improvements over the original game's multimedia: the images were re-rendered in 24-bit <a href="True%20Color">truecolor</a> instead of the original "Myst"s 256 colors (8-bit); the score was re-mastered, and sound effects were enhanced.

"realMyst: Interactive 3D Edition" was a remake of "Myst" released in November 2000 for Windows PCs, and in January 2002 for Mac. Unlike "Myst" and the "Masterpiece Edition", the gameplay of "realMyst" featured free-roaming, <a href="Realtime%203D%20graphics">real-time 3D graphics</a> instead of point-and-click <a href="Pre-rendering">pre-rendered stills</a>. Weather effects like thunderstorms, sunsets, and sunrises were added to the Ages, and minor additions were made to keep the game in sync with the story of the "Myst" novels and sequels. The game also added a new sixth Age called Rime, which is featured in an extended ending, as well as the addition of Ti'ana's grave on Myst island. "realMyst" was developed by Cyan, Inc. and <a href="Sunsoft">Sunsoft</a>, and published by <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>. While the new interactivity of the game was praised, "realMyst" ran poorly on most computers of the time. Robyn Miller expressed frustration with realMyst, saying: "I only saw realMyst after it was released. As a remake, it was a lapse of reason and directionless; overt merchandising of the original Myst. It definitely wasn't how we originally envisioned Myst, as was promoted."

"realMyst: Masterpiece Edition", a visually enhanced revision running on the <a href="Unity%20%28game%20engine%29">Unity engine</a> that also includes the graphics of the original "Myst" game, was released on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> on February 5, 2014. The remake was updated to version 2.0 on January 28, 2015, receiving a significant graphical overhaul in which several bugs were fixed and the detail of many models and textures was upgraded.

On May 18, 2012, the PlayStation Network released a port for "Myst" in the form of a PSone classic for the PlayStation 3 and PSP.

In November 2005, <a href="Midway%20Games">Midway Games</a> announced that they would be developing a remake of "Myst" for the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a>. The remake would include additional content that was not featured in the original "Myst", including the Rime age that was earlier seen in "realMyst". The game was released in Japan and Europe in 2006, and the US version was released in 2008.

A version of "Myst" for the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> was also released in December 2007. The version features re-mastered video and audio, using <a href="source%20code">source code</a> specifically re-written for the Nintendo DS. The remake features <a href="Ages%20of%20Myst%23Rime">Rime</a> as a playable Age, with an all-new graphics set. This version of the game was released in Europe on December 7, 2007, courtesy of <a href="Midway%20Games">Midway</a>. It was released in North America on May 13, 2008, originally published by Navarre and later reissued by Storm City Games. The version was heavily panned by the gaming press, with an aggregate score of 43/100 on Metacritic. This version was again later re-released for Nintendo 3DS, published by Funbox Media in Europe, and Maximum Family Games in North America and Australia. The game later appeared in digital format via the <a href="Nintendo%20eShop">Nintendo eShop</a> in North America on November 15, 2012, and in Europe on September 5, 2013.

In February 2005, Cyan and <a href="Mean%20Hamster%20Software">Mean Hamster Software</a> released "Myst" for the Microsoft <a href="Windows%20Mobile">Windows Mobile</a> platform; "<a href="Riven">Riven</a>" was ported shortly after. In August 2008, Cyan announced that the company was developing a version of "Myst" for Apple's <a href="iOS%20%28Apple%29">iOS</a>. The game was made available to download from the iTunes <a href="App%20Store%20%28iOS%29">App Store</a> on May 2, 2009. The original download size was 727 MB, which was considered very large by iPhone standards. An updated version of "realMyst" was released for <a href="iPad%202">iPad 2</a> and above, with improved graphics over the original PC release, on June 14, 2012. A version for <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> devices based on the "realMyst" version was released on January 26, 2017, produced and published by Noodlecake, and a similar port for "Riven" was released on April 26, 2017.

Thierry Henry

Thierry Daniel Henry (; born 17 August 1977) is a French professional <a href="Association%20football">football</a> coach and former player who was most recently the manager of <a href="Ligue%201">Ligue 1</a> club <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">Monaco</a>.

Considered one of the best strikers of all-time, Henry made his professional debut with Monaco in 1994, where good form led to an international call-up in 1998, after which he signed for defending <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a> champions <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>. Limited playing time at Juve where he was played out of position on the wing allowed him to sign for <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> club <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> for £11 million a year later.

It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class player. Under long-time mentor and coach <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a>, Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal's <a href="List%20of%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20records%20and%20statistics">all-time leading scorer</a> with 228 goals in all competitions. He won two <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s and two league titles at the club, including one <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">unbeaten</a>. In 2003 and 2004, Henry was the runner-up for the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">FIFA World Player of the Year</a>. He was named the <a href="PFA%20Players%27%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Players' Player of the Year</a> twice, and the <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Footballer of the Year</a> three times, and has been named in the <a href="UEFA%20Team%20of%20the%20Year">UEFA Team of the Year</a> five times. Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club <a href="captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a>, leading them to the <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2006 UEFA Champions League Final</a>.

In June 2007, after eight years with Arsenal, he transferred to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> for a fee of €24 million. In 2009, he was an integral part of the club's historic treble when they won <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>, the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey">Copa del Rey</a> and the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>. He went on to achieve an unprecedented sextuple by also winning the <a href="Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Supercopa de España</a>, the <a href="UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a> and the <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>. In 2010, he joined <a href="New%20York%20Red%20Bulls">New York Red Bulls</a> of <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS), where he won the <a href="Supporters%27%20Shield">MLS Supporters' Shield</a> in 2013. He also returned to Arsenal on loan for two months in 2012, before retiring in 2014.

Henry enjoyed sustained success with <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a>, winning the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998 FIFA World Cup</a>, <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000">UEFA Euro 2000</a> and <a href="2003%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup">2003 FIFA Confederations Cup</a>. In October 2007, he became his country's <a href="List%20of%20top%20international%20association%20football%20goal%20scorers%20by%20country">record goalscorer</a>. After amassing 123 appearances and 51 goals, Henry retired from international football after the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>. Henry was also one of the top commercially marketed footballers; he was ranked ninth in the world in 2006.

After retiring, Henry transitioned into coaching, and was appointed as an assistant coach at <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a> in 2016, before assuming the role as the head coach at Monaco in 2018. He was relieved of his duties at Monaco in January 2019.

Henry is of <a href="French%20West%20Indies">Antillean</a> heritage: his father, Antoine, is from <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> (<a href="La%20D%C3%A9sirade">La Désirade</a> island), and his mother, Maryse, is from <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a>. He was born and raised in <a href="Les%20Ulis">Les Ulis</a> suburb of Paris which, despite sometimes being seen as a tough neighbourhood, provided good footballing facilities. As a seven-year-old, Henry showed great potential, prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club <a href="CO%20Les%20Ulis">CO Les Ulis</a>. His father pressured him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football. He joined US Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year his father fell out with the club, so Henry moved to <a href="ES%20Viry-Ch%C3%A2tillon">ES Viry-Châtillon</a> and played there for two years. US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza, Henry's future mentor, followed him there.

In 1990, <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">Monaco</a> sent scout Arnold Catalano to watch Henry, then at the age of 13 in a match. Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6–0. Catalano asked him to join Monaco without even attending a trial first. Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite <a href="INF%20Clairefontaine">INF Clairefontaine</a> academy, and despite the director's reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results, he was allowed to complete the course and joined <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a>'s Monaco as a youth player. Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with Monaco, and made his professional debut on 31 August 1994, in a 2–0 loss against <a href="OGC%20Nice">Nice</a>. Although Wenger suspected that Henry should be deployed as a striker, he put Henry on the left <a href="Winger%20%28soccer%29">wing</a> because he believed that his pace, natural ball control and skill would be more effective against <a href="Left-back">full backs</a> than <a href="Centre%20back">centre-backs</a>.

After a tentative start to his Monaco career, Henry was named the French Young Footballer of the Year in 1996, and in the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20French%20Division%201">1996–97 season</a>, his solid performances helped the club win the <a href="Ligue%201">Ligue 1</a> title. During the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20French%20Division%201">1997–98 season</a>, he was instrumental in leading his club to the <a href="1997-98%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League semi-final</a>, setting a French record by scoring seven goals in the competition. By his third season, he had received his first <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">cap</a> for <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">the national team</a>, and was part of the winning team in the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998 FIFA World Cup</a>. He continued to impress at his tenure with Monaco, and in his five seasons with the French club, the young winger scored 20 league goals in 105 appearances.

Henry left Monaco in January 1999, one year before his intimate and closest teammate <a href="David%20Trezeguet">David Trezeguet</a>, and moved to Italian club <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> for £10.5 million. He played on the wing, but he was ineffective against the defensive discipline exhibited by teams in <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a>, struggling in a position that was uncharacteristic for him, scoring just three goals in 16 appearances.

Unsettled in Italy, Henry transferred from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> for an estimated fee of £11 million, reuniting with his former manager Arsène Wenger. It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer, and although his transfer was not without controversy, Wenger was convinced he was worth the transfer fee. Brought in as a replacement for fellow French forward <a href="Nicolas%20Anelka">Nicolas Anelka</a>, Henry was immediately moulded into a striker by Wenger, a move that would pay rich dividends in years to come. However, doubts were raised about his ability to adapt to the quick and physical English game when he failed to score in his first eight games. After several difficult months in England, Henry even conceded that he had to "be re-taught everything about the art of striking." These doubts were dispelled when he ended <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">his first season</a> at Arsenal with an impressive goal tally of 26. His goal tally included a spectacular strike against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> where he flicked the ball up (with his back turned to goal), before he swivelled and volleyed in from 30 yards out. The strike also featured a <a href="Goal%20celebration%23Memorable%20celebrations">memorable goal celebration</a> where he recreated the Budweiser "Whassup?" advertisement. Arsenal finished second in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20FA%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> behind Manchester United, and lost in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> <a href="2000%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">Final</a> against Turkish club <a href="Galatasaray%20S.K.%20%28football%29">Galatasaray</a>.

Coming off the back of a victorious <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000">UEFA Euro 2000</a> campaign with the national team, Henry was ready to make an impact in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2000–01 season</a>. Despite recording fewer goals and <a href="assist%20%28football%29">assists</a> than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goalscorer. Armed with one of the league's best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.%E2%80%93Manchester%20United%20F.C.%20rivalry">perennial rivals</a> Manchester United in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a>. The team also reached the <a href="2001%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final</a> of the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, losing 2–1 to <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Henry remained frustrated, however, by the fact that he had yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.

Success finally arrived during the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2001–02 season</a>. Arsenal finished seven points above Liverpool to win the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20FA%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> title, and defeated <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> 2–0 in the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> <a href="2002%20FA%20Cup%20Final">Final</a>. Henry became the league's top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a <a href="Double%20%28association%20football%29">double</a> and his first silverware with the club. There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a>, but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage.

<a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2002–03</a> proved to be another productive season for Henry, as he scored 32 goals in all competitions while contributing 23 assists—remarkable returns for a striker. In doing so, he led Arsenal to another <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> triumph (where he was man-of-the-match in the <a href="2003%20FA%20Cup%20Final">Final</a>), although Arsenal failed to retain their <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20FA%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> title. Throughout the season, he competed with Manchester United's <a href="Ruud%20van%20Nistelrooy">Ruud van Nistelrooy</a> for the league scoring title, but the Dutchman edged Henry to the <a href="Premier%20League%20Golden%20Boot">Golden Boot</a> by a single goal. Nonetheless, Henry was named both the <a href="PFA%20Players%27%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Players' Player of the Year</a> and <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Footballer of the Year</a>. His rising status as one of the world's best footballers was affirmed when he emerged runner-up for the <a href="2003%20FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">2003</a> <a href="FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">FIFA World Player of the Year</a> award.

Entering the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2003–04 season</a>, Arsenal were determined to reclaim the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20FA%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> crown. Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal's exceptionally successful campaign; together with the likes of <a href="Dennis%20Bergkamp">Dennis Bergkamp</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a>, <a href="Freddie%20Ljungberg">Freddie Ljungberg</a> and <a href="Robert%20Pires">Robert Pires</a>, Henry ensured that the Gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the <a href="The%20Invincibles%20%28Arsenal%29">entire domestic league season unbeaten</a>, claiming the league title in the process. Apart from being named for the second year running as the <a href="PFA%20Players%27%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">PFA Players' Player of the Year</a> and <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">FWA Footballer of the Year</a>, Henry emerged once again as the runner-up for <a href="2004%20FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">2004</a> FIFA World Player of the Year award. With 39 goals scored in all competitions, the Frenchman led the league in goals scored and won the <a href="European%20Golden%20Shoe">European Golden Boot</a>. However, as was the case in 2002, Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004">UEFA Euro 2004</a>.

This dip in success was compounded when Arsenal failed again to secure back-to-back league titles when they lost out to Chelsea in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2004–05 season</a>, although Arsenal did win the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> (the <a href="2005%20FA%20Cup%20Final">Final</a> of which Henry missed through injury). Henry maintained his reputation as one of Europe's most feared strikers as he led the league in scoring, and with 31 goals in all competitions, he was the co-recipient (with <a href="Diego%20Forl%C3%A1n">Diego Forlán</a>) of the European Golden Boot, and is currently the only player to have officially won the award twice in a row (<a href="Ally%20McCoist">Ally McCoist</a> also had two Golden Boots in a row, but both were deemed <a href="European%20Golden%20Shoe%231991%E2%80%931996">unofficial</a>). The unexpected departure of Arsenal's <a href="Captain%20%28association%20football%29">captain</a> Patrick Vieira in the 2005 close season led to Henry being awarded club captaincy, a role which many felt was not naturally suited for him; the captaincy is more commonly given to defenders or midfielders, who are better-placed on the pitch to read the game. Along with being chief goalscorer, he was responsible for leading a very young team which had yet to gel fully.

The <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2005–06 season</a> proved to be one of remarkable personal achievements for Henry. On 17 October 2005, Henry became the club's <a href="List%20of%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20records%20and%20statistics%23Player%20records">top goalscorer of all time</a>; two goals against <a href="AC%20Sparta%20Prague">Sparta Prague</a> in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> meant he broke <a href="Ian%20Wright">Ian Wright</a>'s record of 185 goals. On 1 February 2006, he scored a goal against <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>, bringing his league goal tally up to 151, breaking Arsenal legend <a href="Cliff%20Bastin">Cliff Bastin</a>'s league goals record. Henry scored his 100th league goal at <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Highbury</a>, a feat unparalleled in the history of the club, and a unique achievement in the Premier League. On the final day of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20FA%20Premier%20League">Premier League</a> season, Henry scored a hat-trick against <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> in the last ever match played at Highbury. He completed the season as the league's top goalscorer, was voted the FWA Footballer of the Year for the third time in his career, and was selected in the <a href="FIFPro%20World%20XI">FIFA World XI</a>.

Nevertheless, Arsenal failed to win the Premier League title again, but hopes of a trophy were revived when Arsenal reached the <a href="2006%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">2006 UEFA Champions League Final</a>. The Gunners eventually lost 2–1 to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, and Arsenal's inability to win the league title for two consecutive seasons combined with the relative inexperience of the Arsenal squad caused much speculation that Henry would leave for another club. However, he declared his love for the club and accepted a four-year contract, and said he would stay at Arsenal for life. Arsenal vice-chairman <a href="David%20Dein">David Dein</a> later claimed the club had turned down two bids of £50 million from Spanish clubs for Henry before the signing of the new contract. Had the transfer materialised, it would have surpassed the then-world record £47 million paid for <a href="Zinedine%20Zidane">Zinedine Zidane</a>.

Henry's <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2006–07</a> season was marred by injuries. Although he scored 10 goals in 17 domestic appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season was cut short in February. Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against <a href="PSV%20Eindhoven">PSV</a> in a <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League%202006-07">Champions League</a> match, but began limping shortly after coming on. Scans the next day revealed that he would need at least three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries, missing the rest of the 2006–07 season. Wenger attributed Henry's injuries to a protracted 2005–06 campaign, and reiterated that Henry was keen on staying with the Gunners to rebuild for the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Arsenal%20F.C.%20season">2007–08 season</a>.

On 25 June 2007, in an unexpected turn of events, Henry was transferred to Barcelona for €24 million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported €6.8 (£4.6) million per season. It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of €125 (£84.9) million. Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving, and maintained that "I always said that if I ever left Arsenal it would be to play for Barcelona." Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry said that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, "Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me even when I was not in the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on." Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.%20in%20European%20football">European competitions</a> with 42 goals; in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.

At Barcelona, Henry was given the number 14 jersey, the same as he had worn at Arsenal. He scored his first goal for his new club on 19 September 2007 in a 3–0 Champions League group stage win over <a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a>, and he recorded his first <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> for Barça in a <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20La%20Liga">Primera División</a> match against <a href="Levante%20UD">Levante</a> ten days later. But with Henry mostly deployed on the wing throughout the season, he was unable to reproduce the goal-scoring form he achieved with Arsenal. He expressed dissatisfaction with the move to Barcelona in the initial year, amidst widespread speculation of a return to the Premier League. In an interview with <a href="Garth%20Crooks">Garth Crooks</a> on <a href="BBC">BBC</a>’s "<a href="Football%20Focus">Football Focus</a>", Henry described missing life "back home" and even "the English press." However, Henry concluded his <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">debut season</a> as the club's top scorer with 19 goals in addition to nine league assists, second behind <a href="Lionel%20Messi">Lionel Messi</a>'s ten.

Henry went on to surpass this tally in a more integrated <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">2008–09</a> campaign, with 26 goals and 10 assists from the left wing. He won the first trophy of his Barcelona career on 13 May 2009 when Barcelona defeated <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Bilbao</a> in the <a href="Copa%20del%20Rey%202008%E2%80%9309">Copa del Rey final</a>. Barcelona won the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20La%20Liga">Primera División</a> and <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a> soon after, completing a <a href="Treble%20%28association%20football%29">treble</a> for the Frenchman, who had combined with Messi and <a href="Samuel%20Eto%27o">Samuel Eto'o</a> to score 100 goals between them that season. The trio was also the most prolific trio in Spanish league history, scoring 72 goals and surpassing the 66 goals of <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>'s <a href="Ferenc%20Pusk%C3%A1s">Ferenc Puskás</a>, <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a> and <a href="Luis%20del%20Sol">Luis del Sol</a> of the 1960–61 season (this was later surpassed by Real Madrid trio <a href="Cristiano%20Ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href="Karim%20Benzema">Karim Benzema</a> and <a href="Gonzalo%20Higua%C3%ADn">Gonzalo Higuaín</a> who scored 89 goals in <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20La%20Liga">2011–12</a>). Later in 2009, Henry helped Barcelona win an unprecedented <a href="the%20sextuple">sextuple</a>, consisting of the aforementioned treble, the <a href="2009%20Supercopa%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Supercopa de España</a>, the <a href="2009%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">UEFA Super Cup</a>, and the <a href="2009%20FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">FIFA Club World Cup</a>.

<a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20FC%20Barcelona%20season">The following season</a>, the emergence of <a href="Pedro%20%28footballer%2C%20born%20July%201987%29">Pedro</a> meant that Henry only started 15 league games. Before the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20La%20Liga">La Liga</a> season ended, and with a year still left on his contract, club president <a href="Joan%20Laporta">Joan Laporta</a> stated on 5 May 2010 that Henry "may go away in the summer transfer window if that's what he wants." After Henry returned from the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 World Cup</a>, Barcelona confirmed that they had agreed to the sale of Henry to an unnamed club, with the player still to agree terms with the new club.

In July 2010, Henry signed a multi-year contract with <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS) club <a href="New%20York%20Red%20Bulls">New York Red Bulls</a> for the <a href="2010%20New%20York%20Red%20Bulls%20season">2010 season</a> as its second <a href="Designated%20Player%20Rule">designated player</a>. He made his full MLS debut on 31 July in a 2–2 draw against <a href="Houston%20Dynamo">Houston Dynamo</a>, assisting both goals to <a href="Juan%20Pablo%20%C3%81ngel">Juan Pablo Ángel</a>. His first MLS goal came on 28 August in a 2–0 victory against <a href="San%20Jose%20Earthquakes">San Jose Earthquakes</a>. The Red Bulls eventually topped the <a href="MLS%20Eastern%20Conference">MLS Eastern Conference</a> by one point over <a href="Columbus%20Crew">Columbus Crew</a> before losing 3–2 on aggregate against <a href="San%20Jose%20Earthquakes">San Jose Earthquakes</a> in the quarter-finals of the <a href="2010%20MLS%20Cup%20Playoffs">2010 MLS Cup Playoffs</a>. <a href="2011%20New%20York%20Red%20Bulls%20season">The next season</a>, the Red Bulls were 10th overall in the league, and bowed out in the Conference semi-finals of the <a href="2011%20MLS%20Cup%20Playoffs">2011 MLS Cup Playoffs</a>.

After training with Arsenal during the MLS off-season, Henry re-signed for the club on a two-month loan deal on 6 January 2012. This was to provide cover for <a href="Gervinho">Gervinho</a> and <a href="Marouane%20Chamakh">Marouane Chamakh</a>, who were unavailable due to their participation in the <a href="2012%20Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations">2012 Africa Cup of Nations</a>. Henry was given the number 12 jersey – his old Arsenal number 14 jersey, the same number he wore at Barcelona and New York, was unavailable, with <a href="Theo%20Walcott">Theo Walcott</a> inheriting it following Henry’s departure from the club in 2007. Henry made his second Arsenal debut as a substitute against <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> in the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> third round and scored the only goal. In his last league game on loan, he scored the winning goal in stoppage time in a 2–1 win against <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a>.

On 17 February 2012, Henry returned to Red Bulls to prepare for the <a href="2012%20New%20York%20Red%20Bulls%20season">2012 season</a>. His base salary of $5 million ($5.6 million guaranteed) made him the highest-paid player in the MLS—surpassing <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a>, who had taken a salary cut for his last year with the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Galaxy">Los Angeles Galaxy</a>. In 2013, Henry's base salary dropped to $3.75 million setting him behind <a href="Robbie%20Keane">Robbie Keane</a>'s $4 million base salary. With bonuses, however, Henry remained the highest-paid player with $4.35 million compared to Keane's $4.33 million.

On 31 March 2012, Henry scored his first MLS <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> in a 5–2 Red Bulls win over the <a href="Montreal%20Impact">Montreal Impact</a>. He was named <a href="MLS%20Player%20of%20the%20Month">MLS Player of the Month</a> that same month. On 27 October 2013, Henry scored once and provided two assists in the last game of the season against the <a href="Chicago%20Fire%20Soccer%20Club">Chicago Fire</a> at <a href="Red%20Bull%20Arena%20%28New%20Jersey%29">Red Bull Arena</a> to help his team win 5–2 and become <a href="Supporters%27%20Shield">champions</a> of the regular season. It was the club's first major trophy in their 17-year history.

On 12 July 2014, Henry provided a goal and three assists in a 4–1 Red Bulls win over the <a href="Columbus%20Crew">Columbus Crew</a>. With that effort he became the all-time assist leader for the New York Red Bulls with 37, surpassing <a href="Amado%20Guevara">Amado Guevara</a> and <a href="Tab%20Ramos">Tab Ramos</a>.

On 1 December 2014, it was announced that Henry had left the Red Bulls after four-and-a-half years at the club. On 16 December, he announced his retirement as a player and stated that he would begin working for <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a> as a pundit. After working at Sky for over three years, Henry quit his position in July 2018 to focus on his career as a coach.

Henry enjoyed a successful career with the <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France national team</a>, winning the first of his 123 caps in June 1997, when his good form for Monaco was rewarded with a call-up to the <a href="France%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Under-20 French national team</a>, where he played in the <a href="1997%20FIFA%20World%20Youth%20Championship">1997 FIFA World Youth Championship</a> alongside future teammates <a href="William%20Gallas">William Gallas</a> and <a href="David%20Trezeguet">David Trezeguet</a>. Within four months, France head coach <a href="Aim%C3%A9%20Jacquet">Aimé Jacquet</a> called Henry up to the senior team. The 20-year-old made his senior international debut on 11 October 1997 in a 2–1 win against <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20football%20team">South Africa</a>. Jacquet was so impressed with Henry that he took him to the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1998 FIFA World Cup</a>. Although Henry was a largely unknown quantity at international level, he ended the tournament as France's top scorer with three goals. He was scheduled to appear as a substitute in the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a>, where France beat <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a> 3–0, but <a href="Marcel%20Desailly">Marcel Desailly</a>'s <a href="Fouls%20and%20misconduct%20%28association%20football%29">sending off</a> forced a defensive change instead. In 1998, he was made "Chevalier" (Knight) of the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a>, France's highest decoration.

Henry was a member of France's <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000">UEFA Euro 2000</a> <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000%20squads%23France">squad</a>, again scoring three goals in the tournament, including the equaliser against <a href="Portugal%20national%20football%20team">Portugal</a> in the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000%20knockout%20stage%23France%20vs%20Portugal">semi-final</a>, and finishing as the country's top scorer. France later won the game in <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a> following a converted <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kick</a> by <a href="Zinedine%20Zidane">Zinedine Zidane</a>. France went on to defeat <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> in extra-time in the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202000%20Final">final</a>, earning Henry his second major international medal. During the tournament, Henry was voted <a href="man%20of%20the%20match">man of the match</a> in three games, including the final against Italy.
The <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2002 FIFA World Cup</a> featured a stunning early exit for both Henry and France as the defending champions were eliminated in the <a href="2002%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Group%20A">group stage</a> after failing to score a goal in all three games. France lost against <a href="Senegal%20national%20football%20team">Senegal</a> in their first group match and Henry was <a href="Red%20card%20%28sports%29">red carded</a> for a dangerous sliding challenge in their next match against <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a>. In that game, France played to a 0–0 draw, but Henry was forced to miss the final group match due to suspension; France lost 2–0 to <a href="Denmark%20national%20football%20team">Denmark</a>.

Henry returned to form for his country at the <a href="2003%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup">2003 FIFA Confederations Cup</a>. Despite playing without team stalwarts Zidane and <a href="Patrick%20Vieira">Patrick Vieira</a>, France won, in large part owing to Henry's outstanding play, for which he was named <a href="Man%20of%20the%20Match">Man of the Match</a> by <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>'s Technical Study Group in three of France's five matches. In the <a href="2003%20FIFA%20Confederations%20Cup%20Final">final</a>, he scored the <a href="golden%20goal">golden goal</a> in extra time to lift the title for the host country after a 1–0 victory over <a href="Cameroon%20national%20football%20team">Cameroon</a>. Henry was awarded both the <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> Golden Ball as the outstanding player of the competition and the Adidas Golden Shoe as the tournament's top goalscorer with four goals.

In <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004">UEFA Euro 2004</a>, Henry played in all of France's matches and scored two goals. France beat <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> in the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004%20Group%20B">group stage</a> but lost to the eventual winners <a href="Greece%20national%20football%20team">Greece</a> 1–0 in the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004%20knockout%20stage%23France%20vs%20Greece">quarter-finals</a>. During the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a> Henry remained as one of the automatic starters in the squad. He played as a lone striker, but despite an indifferent start to the tournament, became one of the top players of the World Cup. He scored three goals, including the winning goal from Zidane's free kick against defending champions Brazil in the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20knockout%20stage%23Brazil%20vs%20France">quarter-final</a>. However, France subsequently lost to Italy <a href="penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">on penalties</a> (5–3) in the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a>. Henry did not take part in the penalty shoot-out, having been substituted in extra time after his legs had cramped. Henry was one of ten nominees for the Golden Ball award for Player of the Tournament, an award which was ultimately presented to his teammate, Zidane and was named a starting striker on the 2006 <a href="FIFPro">FIFPro</a> World XI team.

On 13 October 2007, Henry scored his 41st goal against the <a href="Faroe%20Islands%20national%20football%20team">Faroe Islands</a>, joining <a href="Michel%20Platini">Michel Platini</a> as the country's top goalscorer of all time. Four days later at the <a href="Stade%20de%20la%20Beaujoire">Stade de la Beaujoire</a>, he scored a late double against <a href="Lithuania%20national%20football%20team">Lithuania</a>, thereby setting a new record as France's top goalscorer. On 3 June 2008, Henry made his <a href="List%20of%20footballers%20with%20100%20or%20more%20caps">100th appearance</a> for the national team in a match against <a href="Colombian%20national%20football%20team">Colombia</a>, becoming the sixth French player ever to reach that milestone.

Henry missed the opening game of France's short-lived <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008">UEFA Euro 2008</a> campaign, where they were eliminated in the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008%20Group%20C">group stages</a> after being drawn in the same group as Italy, the <a href="Netherlands%20national%20football%20team">Netherlands</a> and <a href="Romania%20national%20football%20team">Romania</a>. He scored France's only goal in the competition in a 4–1 loss to the Netherlands.

The French team struggled during the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a> <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29">qualifiers</a> and finished second in their <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%E2%80%93%20UEFA%20Group%207">group</a> behind <a href="Serbia%20national%20football%20team">Serbia</a>. During the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%E2%80%93%20UEFA%20Second%20Round">play-offs</a> against the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%20national%20football%20team">Republic of Ireland</a>, Henry was involved in a <a href="France%20vs%20Republic%20of%20Ireland%202010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20play-off">controversy in the second leg</a> of the game at the <a href="Stade%20de%20France">Stade de France</a> on 18 November 2009. With the aggregate score tied at 1–1 and the game in extra time, he used his hand twice to control the ball before delivering a cross to <a href="William%20Gallas">William Gallas</a> who scored the winner. This sparked a barrage of criticism against the Frenchman, while national team coach <a href="Raymond%20Domenech">Raymond Domenech</a> and Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger defended him. The <a href="Football%20Association%20of%20Ireland">Football Association of Ireland</a> lodged a formal complaint with <a href="FIFA">FIFA</a>, seeking a replay of the game, which FIFA declined. Henry said that he contemplated retiring from international football after the reactions to the incident, but maintained that he was not a "cheat"; hours after FIFA had ruled out a replay, he stated that "the fairest solution would be to replay the game". FIFA President <a href="Sepp%20Blatter">Sepp Blatter</a> described the incident as "blatant unfair play" and announced an inquiry into how such incidents could be avoided in future, and added that the incident would be investigated by the Disciplinary Committee. Blatter also said Henry told him that his family had been threatened in the aftermath of the incident. In January 2010, FIFA announced that there was no legal basis to sanction Henry.

Henry did not feature in the starting line-up for France at the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>. France drew in their first game against Uruguay, and lost 2–0 in their second against <a href="Mexico%20national%20football%20team">Mexico</a>. The team was thrown into disarray when <a href="Nicolas%20Anelka">Nicolas Anelka</a> was expelled from the team, and captain <a href="Patrice%20Evra">Patrice Evra</a> led a team protest by refusing to train. In the final <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Group%20A">group game</a> against host-nation South Africa in which Henry came on as a second-half substitute, France lost 2–1 and were eliminated from the tournament. He then announced his retirement from international football, having won 123 caps and scored 51 goals for "Les Bleus", thus finishing his international career as France's all-time top scorer, and second most capped player after <a href="Lilian%20Thuram">Lilian Thuram</a>.

Although Henry played up front as a striker during his youth, he spent his time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Winger">wing</a>. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger immediately changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran <a href="Dennis%20Bergkamp">Dennis Bergkamp</a>. During the 2004–05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal's formation to <a href="Formation%20%28association%20football%29%234%E2%80%935%E2%80%931">4–5–1</a>. This change forced Henry to adapt again to fit into the Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker. Still, Henry remained Arsenal's main offensive threat, on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals. Wenger said of his fellow Frenchman: "Thierry Henry could take the ball in the middle of the park and score a goal that no one else in the world could score".

One of the reasons cited for Henry's impressive play up front is his ability to calmly score from one-on-ones. According to his father Antoine, Henry learned precision shooting from watching his idol <a href="Marco%20van%20Basten">Marco van Basten</a>. He was also influenced by <a href="Rom%C3%A1rio">Romário</a>, <a href="Ronaldo%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29">Ronaldo</a> and Liberian star <a href="George%20Weah">George Weah</a>, a new breed of strikers in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal. At his physical peak from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, Henry's ability to <a href="Dribbling%23Association%20football">dribble</a> past opponents with exceptional pace, skill and composure, meant that he could get in behind defenders regularly enough to score. In 2004, former Arsenal striker Alan Smith commented on Henry: "I have to say I haven't seen a player like him. He's an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best."
When up front, Henry is occasionally known to move out wide to the left wing position, something which enables him to contribute heavily in <a href="assist%20%28football%29">assists</a>: between 2002–03 and 2004–05, the striker managed almost 50 assists in total and this was attributed to his unselfish play and creativity. Coming in from the left, Henry’s trademark finish saw him place the ball inside the far right corner of the goal. Henry would also drift offside to fool the defence then run back onside before the ball is played and beat the <a href="Offside%20%28association%20football%29">offside trap</a>, although he never provided Arsenal a distinct aerial threat. Given his versatility in being able to operate as both a winger and a striker, the Frenchman is not a prototypical "<a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Striker">out-and-out striker</a>", but he has emerged consistently as one of Europe's most prolific strikers. In <a href="set%20piece%20%28football%29">set pieces</a>, Henry was the first-choice <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a> and <a href="direct%20free%20kick">free kick</a> taker for Arsenal, scoring regularly from those positions. Henry was also a notable exponent of a no-look pass where he would <a href="Dummy%20%28football%29">feint</a> to pass the ball with his right foot, but would make contact with the ball using his standing foot (his left).

Henry began coaching Arsenal's youth teams in February 2015, in tandem with his work for Sky Sports. His influence on the team was praised by players such as <a href="Alex%20Iwobi">Alex Iwobi</a>, who dedicated a goal against Bayern Munich in the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Youth%20League">2015–16 UEFA Youth League</a> to his advice. Having earned a <a href="UEFA%20A%20Licence">UEFA A Licence</a>, he was offered the job of under-18 coach by Academy head <a href="Andries%20Jonker">Andries Jonker</a>, but the decision was overruled by Wenger, who wanted a full-time coach for the team.

In August 2016, Henry became second assistant coach of the <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium national team</a>, working alongside head coach <a href="Roberto%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Roberto Martínez</a> and fellow assistant <a href="Graeme%20Jones">Graeme Jones</a>. In an interview with <a href="NBC%20Sports">NBC Sports</a>, Belgium striker <a href="Romelu%20Lukaku">Romelu Lukaku</a> praised Henry for his work with him, stating, "Henry is the best thing that has happened to me because since I came to England aged 18 I have had the best mentors. Thierry for me is the best. Every day whether it is positive and negative I take it in my stride because I know what is expected from the top level.” At the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2018 FIFA World Cup</a>, Belgium reached the semi-final, but lost to Henry’s home nation France 1–0. Henry picked up a Bronze medal after Belgium defeated <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> 2–0 in the third-place play-off to secure their best ever World Cup finish.

Henry was reportedly offered the position of head coach by <a href="FC%20Girondins%20de%20Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> in August 2018. However, the offer was not accepted by Henry after disagreements with the club’s owners. Days after turning down the Bordeaux job, and following Jones’s departure from the Belgium national team, Henry, who had been the forwards coach, was promoted to Belgium assistant coach. However, his tenure in the role was short-lived, after he accepted the role as head coach at former club <a href="AS%20Monaco%20FC">Monaco</a> in October.

On 11 October 2018, Monaco dismissed <a href="Leonardo%20Jardim">Leonardo Jardim</a> as club manager. Jardim's position had become untenable after struggling heavily in domestic competition, with the club 18th at the time of his departure, and disputes over the club's transfer policy. Monaco's search for a new coach coincided with the regulatory mid-season international break, allowing the club sufficient time to search for a replacement, however, they quickly decided on Henry, and he was appointed a mere two days later. He signed a three-year deal, and was unveiled as Monaco manager on 18 October. At his first press conference, he told reporters: "This club will always have a big place in my heart, so to be able to come here and start again, it is a dream come true. There is a lot of work to do, as you can imagine – but I am more than happy to be here".

Henry's arrival at Monaco was greeted with mixed reactions by some media outlets, due to his relative inexperience as a top-level coach and the task of overturning Monaco's misfortunes. Despite inheriting a squad of sub-standard quality, Henry expressed a desire of replicating the football he played under <a href="Pep%20Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a> at <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, as well as instilling the "professionalism" taught to him by <a href="Ars%C3%A8ne%20Wenger">Arsène Wenger</a>. Henry also adopted a hands-on approach to training sessions, being regularly involved in devising schemes and instructing drills. His first match was a 2–1 away defeat against <a href="Racing%20Club%20de%20Strasbourg%20Alsace">Strasbourg</a> on 20 October. He was unable to secure a win for over a month, enduring a period which included two high profile defeats against <a href="Club%20Brugge%20KV">Club Brugge</a> and <a href="Paris%20Saint-Germain%20F.C.">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, prior to defeating <a href="Stade%20Malherbe%20Caen">Caen</a> on 1–0 on 25 November. He secured two wins in December, defeating <a href="Amiens%20SC">Amiens</a> in the league and <a href="FC%20Lorient">Lorient</a> in the <a href="Coupe%20de%20la%20Ligue">Coupe de la Ligue</a>, however, this was on the backdrop of three additional Ligue 1 defeats to close 2018 in the relegation zone.

In January 2019, Henry entered the winter transfer window, where he signed left-back <a href="Fod%C3%A9%20Ballo-Tour%C3%A9">Fodé Ballo-Touré</a>, and former Arsenal teammate <a href="Cesc%20F%C3%A0bregas">Cesc Fàbregas</a> from <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>. He also sanctioned the loan signing of French defensive midfielder <a href="William%20Vainqueur">William Vainqueur</a> on 12 January, and experienced defender <a href="Naldo%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201982%29">Naldo</a>. However, these signings would not turn around the club's fate, and on 24 January, Henry was dismissed at Monaco. The club were 19th at the time of his departure, and Henry left with a record of 4 wins, 5 draws, and 11 defeats, from 20 games in charge.

Henry has received many plaudits and awards in his football career. He was runner-up for the 2003 and 2004 <a href="FIFA%20World%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">FIFA World Player of the Year</a> awards; in those two seasons, he also won back-to-back PFA Players' Player of the Year titles. Henry is the only player ever to have won the FWA Footballer of the Year three times (2003, 2004, 2006), and the French Player of the Year on a record four occasions. Henry was voted into the Premier League Overseas Team of the Decade in the 10 Seasons Awards poll in 2003, and in 2004 he was named by football legend <a href="Pel%C3%A9">Pelé</a> on the <a href="FIFA%20100">FIFA 100</a> list of the world's greatest living players.

In terms of goal-scoring awards, Henry was the European Golden Boot winner in 2004 and 2005 (sharing it with <a href="Villarreal%20CF">Villarreal</a>'s <a href="Diego%20Forl%C3%A1n">Diego Forlán</a> in 2005). Henry was also the top goalscorer in the Premier League for a record four seasons (2002, 2004, 2005, 2006). In 2006, he became the first player to score more than 20 goals in the league for five consecutive seasons (2002 to 2006). With 175, Henry is currently fifth in the <a href="List%20of%20Premier%20League%20players%20with%20100%20or%20more%20goals">list of all-time Premier League goalscorers</a>, behind <a href="Alan%20Shearer">Alan Shearer</a>, <a href="Andy%20Cole">Andy Cole</a>, <a href="Wayne%20Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> and <a href="Frank%20Lampard">Frank Lampard</a>. All of his Premier League goals were for Arsenal, giving him the record for most goals in the competition for one club, until it was broken by Rooney in 2016. France's all-time record goalscorer was, in his prime in the mid 2000s, regarded by many coaches, footballers and journalists as one of the best players in the world. In November 2007, he was ranked 33rd on the <a href="Association%20of%20Football%20Statisticians">Association of Football Statisticians</a>' compendium for "Greatest Ever Footballers."

Arsenal fans honoured their former player in 2008, declaring Henry the greatest Arsenal player. In two other 2008 surveys, Henry emerged as the favourite Premier League player of all time among 32,000 people surveyed in the Barclays 2008 Global Fan Report. In 2009, Henry was voted the best Premier League player of the 2000s. Arsenal fan and <a href="The%20Who">The Who</a> lead singer <a href="Roger%20Daltrey">Roger Daltrey</a> mentions Henry in the tribute song "Highbury Highs", which he performed at Arsenal's last ever game at Highbury on 7 May 2006. On 10 December 2011, Arsenal unveiled a bronze statue of Henry at the Emirates Stadium as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations. In 2017, "<a href="FourFourTwo">FourFourTwo</a>" magazine ranked him first in their list of the 30 best strikers in Premier League history.

Henry married English model Nicole Merry, real name Claire, on 5 July 2003. The ceremony was held at <a href="Highclere%20Castle">Highclere Castle</a>, and on 27 May 2005 the couple celebrated the birth of their first child, Téa. Henry dedicated his first goal following Téa's birth to her by holding his fingers in a "T" shape and kissing them after scoring in a match against <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>. When Henry was still at Arsenal, he also purchased a home in <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, <a href="North%20London">North London</a>. However, shortly after his transfer to Barcelona, it was announced that Henry and his wife would divorce; the <a href="decree%20nisi">decree nisi</a> was granted in September 2007. Their separation concluded in December 2008 when Henry paid Merry a divorce settlement close to her requested sum of £10 million.

As a fan of the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA), Henry is often seen with his friend <a href="Tony%20Parker">Tony Parker</a> at games when not playing football. Henry stated in an interview that he admires basketball, as it is similar to football in pace and excitement. Having made regular trips to the <a href="NBA%20Finals">NBA Finals</a> in the past, he went to watch Parker and the <a href="San%20Antonio%20Spurs">San Antonio Spurs</a> in the <a href="2007%20NBA%20Finals">2007 NBA Finals</a>; and in the <a href="2001%20NBA%20Finals">2001 NBA Finals</a>, he went to Philadelphia to help with French television coverage of the Finals as well as to watch <a href="Allen%20Iverson">Allen Iverson</a>, whom he named as one of his favourite players.

Henry makes a short cameo appearance in the 2015 film "<a href="Entourage%20%28film%29">Entourage</a>". Henry's part sees him walking a dog and having exchange with Ari Gold (character played by <a href="Jeremy%20Piven">Jeremy Piven</a>), who is an over-the-top Hollywood agent.

Henry is a member of the <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a>-FIFA squad, where together with other professional footballers he appeared in a series of TV spots seen by hundreds of millions of fans around the world during the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. In these spots, the players promote football as a game that must be played on behalf of children.

Having been subjected to racism in the past, Henry is an active spokesperson against <a href="racism%20in%20football">racism in football</a>. The most prominent incident of racism against Henry was during a training session with the <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spanish national team</a> in 2004, when a Spanish TV crew caught coach <a href="Luis%20Aragon%C3%A9s">Luis Aragonés</a> referring to Henry as "black shit" to <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Reyes">José Antonio Reyes</a>, Henry's teammate at Arsenal. The incident caused an uproar in the British media, and there were calls for Aragonés to be sacked. Henry and <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> started the <a href="Stand%20Up%20Speak%20Up">Stand Up Speak Up</a> campaign against racism in football as a result of the incident. Subsequently, in 2007, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" featured him as one of the "Heroes & Pioneers" on the <a href="TIME%20100">"Time" 100</a> list of the most influential people in the world.

Along with 45 other football players, Henry took part in FIFA's "<a href="Live%20for%20Love%20United">Live for Love United</a>" in 2002. The single was released in tandem with the 2002 FIFA World Cup and its proceeds went towards AIDS research. Henry also supports the <a href="Cystic%20Fibrosis%20Foundation">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</a> and <a href="Cystic%20Fibrosis%20Trust">Cystic Fibrosis Trust</a>.

Henry has also played in charity football games for various causes. In June 2018, he reunited with his France 1998 World Cup winning teammates to play a charity game against an All-Star team which included Jamaican sprinter <a href="Usain%20Bolt">Usain Bolt</a>, with proceeds going to the Mecenet Cardiac Charity and the Children of the World fund. In a 3–2 win for France, Henry played a trademark no-look one-two pass with <a href="Zinedine%20Zidane">Zinedine Zidane</a> before scoring with a 20 yard curling strike.

In 2006, Henry was valued as the ninth-most commercially marketable footballer in the world, and throughout his career he has signed many endorsements and appeared in commercials.

At the beginning of his career, Henry signed with sportswear giant <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a>. In the buildup to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, Henry featured in Nike's "<a href="Secret%20Tournament">Secret Tournament</a>" advertisement, directed by <a href="Terry%20Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>, along with 24 superstar football players including <a href="Ronaldo%20%28Brazilian%20footballer%29">Ronaldo</a>, <a href="Ronaldinho">Ronaldinho</a>, <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Figo">Luís Figo</a>, <a href="Francesco%20Totti">Francesco Totti</a>, <a href="Roberto%20Carlos%20%28footballer%29">Roberto Carlos</a> and Japanese star <a href="Hidetoshi%20Nakata">Hidetoshi Nakata</a>, with former player <a href="Eric%20Cantona">Eric Cantona</a> the tournament "referee." In a 2004 advertisement, Henry pits his wits against football stars such as <a href="Claude%20Makelele">Claude Makelele</a>, <a href="Edgar%20Davids">Edgar Davids</a> and <a href="Freddie%20Ljungberg">Freddie Ljungberg</a> in locations such as his bedroom and living room, which was partly inspired by Henry himself, who revealed that he always has a football nearby, even at home. In tandem with the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Henry also featured in Nike's "Joga Bonito" campaign, Portuguese for "<a href="The%20Beautiful%20Game">beautiful game</a>."

Henry's deal with Nike ended after the 2006 FIFA World Cup, when he signed a deal with <a href="Reebok">Reebok</a> to appear in their "I Am What I Am" campaign. As part of Reebok Entertainment's "Framed" series, Henry was the star of a half-hour episode that detailed the making of a commercial about himself directed by Spanish actress <a href="Paz%20Vega">Paz Vega</a>. In 2011, Henry switched to <a href="Puma%20SE">Puma</a> boots.

Henry featured in the <a href="Renault%20Clio">Renault Clio</a> advertisements in which he popularised the term "va-va-voom", meaning "life" or "passion." His romantic interest in the commercial was his then-girlfriend, later his wife (now divorced), Claire Merry. ""Va-va-voom"" was subsequently added to the "<a href="Concise%20Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Concise Oxford English Dictionary</a>".

In February 2007, Henry was named as one of the three global ambassadors of <a href="Gillette%20%28brand%29">Gillette</a>'s "Champions Program," which purported to feature three of the "best-known, most widely respected and successful athletes competing today" and also showcased <a href="Roger%20Federer">Roger Federer</a> and <a href="Tiger%20Woods">Tiger Woods</a> in a series of television commercials. In reaction to the <a href="2009%20Republic%20of%20Ireland%20v%20France%20football%20matches">handball controversy</a> following the France vs Ireland 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier, Gillette faced a boycott and accusations of doctoring French versions of their Champions poster, but subsequently released a statement backing Henry.

Henry was part of <a href="Pepsi">Pepsi</a>'s "Dare For More" campaign in 2005, alongside the likes of <a href="David%20Beckham">David Beckham</a> and <a href="Ronaldinho">Ronaldinho</a>. He starred in a 2014 advert for <a href="Beats%20Electronics">Beats</a> headphones with other global football stars including <a href="Neymar">Neymar</a> and <a href="Luis%20Su%C3%A1rez">Luis Suárez</a>, with the theme of "The Game Before the Game" and the players pre-game ritual of listening to music.

Henry featured on the front cover of the editions of <a href="EA%20Sports">EA Sports</a>' <a href="FIFA%20%28video%20game%20series%29">"FIFA" video game series</a> from "<a href="FIFA%202001">FIFA 2001</a>" to "<a href="FIFA%202005">FIFA 2005</a>". He was included as an icon to the Ultimate Team in "<a href="FIFA%2018">FIFA 18</a>".

Grey currawong

The grey currawong ("Strepera versicolor") is a large <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird native to southern <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, including <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. One of three <a href="currawong">currawong</a> species in the genus "Strepera", it is closely related to the <a href="butcherbird">butcherbird</a>s and <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a> of the family <a href="Artamidae">Artamidae</a>. It is a large crow-like bird, around long on average, with yellow irises, and a heavy bill, and dark <a href="plumage">plumage</a> with white undertail and wing patches. The male and female are similar in appearance. Six <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised and are distinguished by overall plumage colour, which ranges from slate-grey for the <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate</a> from New South Wales and eastern Victoria and subspecies "plumbea" from Western Australia, to sooty black for the clinking currawong of Tasmania and subspecies "halmaturina" from <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a>. All grey currawongs have a loud distinctive ringing or clinking call.

Within its range, the grey currawong is generally sedentary, although it is a winter visitor in the southeastern corner of Australia. Comparatively little studied, much of its behaviour and habits is poorly known. <a href="omnivore">Omnivorous</a>, it has a diet that includes a variety of berries, <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, and small vertebrates. Less arboreal than the <a href="pied%20currawong">pied currawong</a>, the grey currawong spends more time foraging on the ground. It builds nests high in trees, which has limited the study of its breeding habits. Unlike its more common relative, it has adapted poorly to human impact and has declined in much of its range. The habitat includes all kinds of forested areas as well as <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a> in dryer parts of the country.

The grey currawong was first described as "Corvus versicolor" by ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in 1801, who gave it the <a href="common%20name">common name</a> of "variable crow". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "versicolor" means 'of variable colours' in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. Other old common names include grey crow-shrike, leaden crow-shrike, mountain magpie, black-winged currawong (in western Victoria), clinking currawong (in Tasmania), and squeaker (in Western Australia). The black-winged currawong was known to the <a href="Ramindjeri">Ramindjeri</a> people of <a href="Encounter%20Bay">Encounter Bay</a> as "wati-eri", the word meaning "to sneak" or "to track". "Kiling-kildi" was a name derived from the call used by the people of the lower Murray River.

Together with the <a href="pied%20currawong">pied currawong</a> ("S. graculina") and <a href="black%20currawong">black currawong</a> ("S. fuliginosa"), the grey currawong forms the genus "<a href="Strepera">Strepera</a>". Although <a href="Corvidae">crow</a>-like in appearance and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and are instead closely related to the <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a> and the <a href="butcherbird">butcherbird</a>s. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist <a href="John%20Albert%20Leach">John Albert Leach</a> after he had studied their musculature. Ornithologists <a href="Charles%20Sibley">Charles Sibley</a> and <a href="Jon%20Edward%20Ahlquist">Jon Ahlquist</a> recognised the close relationship between the <a href="woodswallow">woodswallow</a>s and the butcherbirds and relatives in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini <a href="clade">clade</a>, which later became the family <a href="Artamidae">Artamidae</a>.

Six subspecies are spread around Australia. They vary extensively in the colour of their plumage, from grey to sooty black, and the amount of white on their wings, and most were at one time considered separate species:



A larger and more slender bird than its more common relative the pied currawong, the adult grey currawong ranges from in length, with an average of around ; the wingspan varies from , averaging around , with an average weight of around . Adults of the Tasmanian subspecies average around . The male is on average slightly larger than the female, but the size and weight ranges mostly overlap. It is generally a dark grey bird with white in the wing, undertail <a href="covert%20%28feather%29">coverts</a>, the base of the tail and most visibly, the tip of the tail. It has yellow eyes. The orbital (eye-ring), legs and feet are black, whereas the bill and <a href="gape">gape</a> range from greyish black to black. The overall plumage varies according to subspecies. The nominate race "versicolor" and "plumbea" are slate-grey in colour, while "melanoptera" and "intermedia" are blackish-brown, and "arguta" of Tasmania and "halmaturina" a sooty black. The size of the white patch on the wing also varies, being large and easily spotted in "versicolor", "plumbea", "intermedia" and "arguta", but non-existent or indistinct in "melanoptera" and "halmaturina".

More specifically, the nominate subspecies has a grey forehead, crown, nape, ear-coverts and throat with the face a darker grey-black. The feathers of the throat are longer, giving rise to <a href="Hackle%20%28animal%29">hackles</a> there. The upperparts and underparts are a brownish-grey and become more brown with age. Towards the belly, the feathers are a paler grey. The wings are grey-brown, and the blackish primaries have white edges which merge to form the prominent white wing markings.

Birds appear to <a href="Moulting">moult</a> once a year in spring or summer, although observations have been limited. Young birds spend about a year in juvenile plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores and eyes are less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. Their eyes are brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact timing is unknown but likely to be around four months of age.

Unlike that of the pied currawong, the grey currawong's call does not sound like its name. It is best known for making a sound variously transcribed as "p'rink", "clink", "cling", "ker-link" or "tullock", either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as very loud and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; <a href="Edwin%20Ashby">Edwin Ashby</a> wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the "kling" of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races "versicolor" and "melanoptera" are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the <a href="superb%20lyrebird">superb lyrebird</a>, which imitates the currawong call at times.

A softer and more tuneful musical call has been called the "toy-trumpet call". It has been reported to foretell rainy weather. The loud "bell call" resembles the clinking call, and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when <a href="Begging%20behavior%20in%20animals">begging for food</a> from a parent or mate, similar to the begging call of the <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a>, and make a gobbling sound when fed.

The grey currawong is unlikely to be confused with other species apart from other currawongs. It is immediately distinguishable from crows and ravens as they have wholly black plumage, a stockier build and white (rather than yellow) eyes. However, it can be encountered in mixed-species flocks with the pied currawong. It can be distinguished by its paler plumage, lack of white base to the tail, straighter bill, and very different vocalisations. In northwestern Victoria, the black-winged currawong (subspecies "melanoptera") has a darker plumage than other grey subspecies, and is thus more similar in appearance to the pied currawong, but its wings lack the white primaries of the latter species. In Tasmania, the black currawong is similar but has a heavier bill and call similar to the pied and lacks the white rump.

Grey currawongs are found right across the southern part of Australia from the <a href="Central%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Central Coast</a> region of New South Wales, occurring south of latitude 32°S southwards and westwards, from the vicinity of <a href="Mudgee">Mudgee</a> in the north and southwest to <a href="Temora%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Temora</a> and <a href="Albury%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Albury</a> onto the <a href="Riverina">Riverina</a> and across most of Victoria and southern South Australia to the fertile <a href="Southwest%20Australia">south-west</a> corner of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> and the semi-arid country surrounding it. The clinking subspecies is endemic to <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, where it is more common in the eastern parts, but is absent from <a href="King%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">King</a> and <a href="Flinders%20Island">Flinders Island</a>s in <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a>. There is an outlying population in the arid area where the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> meets <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and Western Australia. In general, the grey currawong is sedentary throughout its range, although it appears to be resident in the cooler months only in south <a href="Gippsland">Gippsland</a> in eastern Victoria and the far south coast of New South Wales.

The grey currawong is found in wet and dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forests across its range, as well as <a href="Mallee%20Woodlands%20and%20Shrublands">mallee scrubland</a>, and open areas such as parks or farmland near forested areas. It also inhabits pine plantations. Preferences vary between regions; subspecies "versicolor" is more common in wetter forests in southeastern mainland Australia, while the Tasmanian subspecies "arguta" is found most commonly in lowland dry sclerophyll forest. The subspecies "melanoptera" and "intermedia" are found mainly in mallee scrublands and woodlands, while in Western Australia, subspecies "plumbea" is found in various forests and woodlands, such as jarrah ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20marginata">Eucalyptus marginata</a>"), karri ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20diversicolor">E. diversicolor</a>"), tuart ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20gomphocephala">E. gomphocephala</a>") and wandoo ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20wandoo">E. wandoo</a>"), as well as <a href="Melaleuca">paperbark</a> woodlands around swampy areas, and acacia shrublands dominated by summer-scented wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20rostellifera">Acacia rostellifera</a>") and mulga ("<a href="Acacia%20aneura">Acacia aneura</a>") with "<a href="Eremophila%20%28plant%29">Eremophila</a>" understory.

The grey currawong appears to have declined across its distribution; formerly common, it became scarce in northern Victoria in the 1930s, and in northeastern Victoria in the 1960s. <a href="Habitat%20destruction">Habitat destruction</a> has seen it decline in southeastern South Australia around <a href="Naracoorte%2C%20South%20Australia">Naracoorte</a> and from many areas in the <a href="Wheatbelt%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Western Australian Wheatbelt</a>. It also became rare in the <a href="Margaret%20River%2C%20Western%20Australia">Margaret River</a> and <a href="Cape%20Naturaliste">Cape Naturaliste</a> regions after 1920, and vanished from much of the <a href="Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a> by the 1940s. One place which has seen an increase in numbers is the <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> in the 1960s. The species has never been common in the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a> and sightings have been uncommon and scattered since the time of John Gould in the early 19th century. The status of the species is uncertain in the Northern Territory, where it may be extinct. It has been classified as "critically endangered" there pending further information.

Overall, data on the social behaviour of the grey currawong is lacking, and roosting habits are unknown. It is generally shyer and more wary than its pied relative, but has become more accustomed to people in areas of high human activity in southwest Western Australia. Its undulating flight is rapid and silent. It hops or runs when on the ground. Birds are generally encountered singly or in pairs, but may forage in groups of three to eleven birds. Up to forty birds may gather to harvest a fruit tree if one is found. The black-winged subspecies is seldom seen in groups larger than four or five, while the clinking currawong may form groups of up to forty birds over the non-breeding season.

There is some evidence of <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territoriality</a>, as birds in the Wheatbelt maintain territories year-round there. The grey currawong has been recorded harassing larger birds such as the <a href="wedge-tailed%20eagle">wedge-tailed eagle</a>, <a href="square-tailed%20kite">square-tailed kite</a> and <a href="Australian%20hobby">Australian hobby</a>. The species has been observed bathing by shaking its wings in water at ponds, as well as applying clay to its plumage after washing.

Two species of <a href="chewing%20louse">chewing louse</a> have been isolated and described from grey currawongs: ("<a href="Menacanthus%20dennisi">Menacanthus dennisi</a>") from subspecies "halmaturina" on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, and "<a href="Australophilopterus%20strepericus">Australophilopterus strepericus</a>" from subspecies "arguta" near <a href="Launceston%2C%20Tasmania">Launceston</a> in Tasmania. A new species of <a href="spiruria">spiruria</a>n <a href="nematode">nematode</a>, "<a href="Microtetrameres%20streperae">Microtetrameres streperae</a>" isolated from a grey currawong at <a href="Waikerie%2C%20South%20Australia">Waikerie</a> was described in 1977.

The breeding habits of the grey currawong are not well known, and the inaccessibility of its nests makes study difficult. The breeding season lasts from August to December. The grey currawong builds a large shallow nest of thin sticks lined with grass and bark high in trees; generally eucalypts are chosen. It produces a <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of one to five (though usually two or three) rounded or tapered oval <a href="Bird%20egg">eggs</a>, which vary in size and colour according to subspecies. Those of subspecies "versicolor" average in size and are a pale brown or <a href="Buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a> with shades of pink or wine tones, and are marked with streaks or splotches of darker brown, purple-brown, slate-grey or even blue-tinged. Those of the black-winged currawong are similarly sized at and are buff or flesh-coloured with a purple tint and marked with darker browns or purple-browns. The clinking currawong lays larger and paler eggs of dull white, pale grey or buff with a faint wine-colour tint, and marked with darker tones of purple-, grey- or blue-tinged brown, which average . The eggs of the brown currawong are also pale wine-tinted brown, buff, or cream with darker markings of cinnamon, brown or purple-brown, and measure . Finally, the western subspecies lays eggs averaging in size which are pale shades of red-brown or wine-colour, with darker red-brown markings. In all subspecies, the markings can coalesce over the larger end of the egg to form a darker 'cap'. The <a href="Avian%20incubation">incubation</a> period is poorly known because of the difficulty of observing nests, but one observation suggested around 23 days from laying to hatching. Like all <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, the chicks are born naked, and blind (<a href="altricial">altricial</a>), and remain in the nest for an extended period (<a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a>). Both parents feed the young.

Data on nesting success rates is limited; one study of 35 nests found 28 (80%) resulted in the fledging of at least one young currawong. Causes of failure included nest collapse by gale-force winds and rain, and harassment and nest raiding by pied currawongs. The incidence of <a href="brood%20parasitism">brood parasitism</a> is uncertain. A pair of grey currawongs have been observed feeding a <a href="channel-billed%20cuckoo">channel-billed cuckoo</a> ("Scythrops novaehollandiae") chick on one occasion.

The grey currawong is an omnivorous and opportunistic feeder. It preys on many invertebrates, such as snails, spiders and woodlice, and a wide variety of insects including beetles, earwigs, cockroaches, wasps, ants and grasshoppers, and smaller vertebrates, including frogs, lizards such as the <a href="bearded%20dragon">bearded dragon</a> as well as skinks, rats, mice, and nestlings or young of <a href="Tasmanian%20nativehen">Tasmanian nativehen</a>, <a href="red%20wattlebird">red wattlebird</a>, <a href="eastern%20spinebill">eastern spinebill</a>, <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a> ("Passer domesticus"), and <a href="splendid%20fairywren">splendid fairywren</a> ("M. splendens"), It has been recorded hunting at the nests of the <a href="superb%20fairywren">superb fairywren</a> ("Malurus cyaneus"), and the <a href="bell%20miner">bell miner</a> ("Manorina melanophrys").

A wide variety of plant material is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of "<a href="Ficus">Ficus</a>" species, "<a href="Leucopogon">Leucopogon</a>" species, "<a href="Exocarpos">Exocarpos</a>" species, a cycad "<a href="Macrozamia%20riedlei">Macrozamia riedlei</a>", a mistletoe "<a href="Lysiana%20exocarpi">Lysiana exocarpi</a>", "<a href="Astroloma%20humifusum">Astroloma humifusum</a>", "<a href="Astroloma%20pinifolium">A. pinifolium</a>", "<a href="Myoporum%20insulare">Myoporum insulare</a>", "<a href="Enchylaena%20tomentosa">Enchylaena tomentosa</a>" and "<a href="Coprosma%20quadrifida">Coprosma quadrifida</a>". The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as "<a href="Pyracantha%20angustifolia">Pyracantha angustifolia</a>" and "<a href="Pyracantha%20fortuneana">P. fortuneana</a>", and "<a href="Cotoneaster">Cotoneaster</a>" species, and crops such as <a href="maize">maize</a>, <a href="apple">apple</a>s, <a href="pear">pear</a>s, <a href="quince">quince</a>, various stone fruit of the genus "<a href="Prunus">Prunus</a>", <a href="grape">grape</a>s, <a href="tomato">tomato</a>, <a href="passion%20flower">passion flower</a>s, and the nectar of gymea lily ("<a href="Doryanthes%20excelsa">Doryanthes excelsa</a>"). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong has been identified as the main <a href="Vector%20%28dispersal%29">vector</a> for the spread of bridal creeper ("<a href="Asparagus%20asparagoides">Asparagus asparagoides</a>"). Boneseed ("<a href="Chrysanthemoides%20monilifera">Chrysanthemoides monilifera</a>" subspecies "monilifera"), another <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> readily dispersed in bird droppings, is also consumed by grey currawongs. In Tasmania, "A. pinifolium" is especially popular, and one observer noted that the normally noisy birds became quiet and sluggish after eating it, prompting him to wonder whether the plant had a narcotic effect on the birds.

Foraging takes place on the ground, or less commonly in trees or shrubs. Most commonly the grey currawong probes the ground for prey, but sometimes chases more mobile animals. It has been recorded removing insects from parked cars, as well as employing the "zirkeln" method, where it inserts its bill in a crack or under a rock and uses it to lever open a wider space to hunt prey. In one case, a bird was observed holding bark off the branch of a <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a> and levering open gaps every with its bill. The grey currawong usually swallows prey whole, although one bird was observed impaling a rodent on a stick and eating parts of it, in the manner of a butcherbird. A field study on <a href="road%20ecology">road ecology</a> in southwestern Australia revealed that the grey currawong is unusual in inhabiting cleared areas adjacent to roads. However, it was not recorded feeding on roadkill, and moves away from the area in breeding season. It was also commonly hit and killed by vehicles.

Black currawong

The black currawong ("Strepera fuliginosa"), also known locally as the black jay, is a large <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird <a href="Endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> to <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and the nearby islands within the <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a>. One of three <a href="currawong">currawong</a> species in the genus "Strepera", it is closely related to the <a href="butcherbird">butcherbird</a>s and <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a> within the family <a href="Artamidae">Artamidae</a>. It is a large crow-like bird, around long on average, with yellow irises, a heavy bill, and black <a href="plumage">plumage</a> with white wing patches. The male and female are similar in appearance. Three <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised, one of which, "Strepera fuliginosa colei" of <a href="King%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">King Island</a>, is <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> to extinction.

Within its range, the black currawong is generally sedentary, although populations at higher altitudes relocate to lower areas during the cooler months. The habitat includes densely forested areas as well as alpine <a href="Heath%20%28habitat%29">heathland</a>. It is rare below altitudes of . <a href="omnivore">Omnivorous</a>, it has a diet that includes a variety of berries, <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, and small vertebrates. Less <a href="wikt%3Aarboreal">arboreal</a> than the <a href="pied%20currawong">pied currawong</a>, the black currawong spends more time foraging on the ground. It roosts and breeds in trees.

The black currawong was first described by ornithologist <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> in 1836 as "Cracticus fuliginosus", and in 1837 as "Coronica fuliginosa". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> is the <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> adjective "fuliginosus" "sooty" from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "fūlīgo" "soot", and refers to the black plumage. American ornithologist <a href="Dean%20Amadon">Dean Amadon</a> regarded the black currawong as a subspecies of the <a href="pied%20currawong">pied currawong</a> ("Strepera graculina"), seeing it as part of a continuum with subspecies "ashbyi" of the latter species, the complex having progressively less white plumage as one moves south. Subsequent authors have considered it a separate species, although <a href="Richard%20Schodde">Richard Schodde</a> and Ian Mason describe it as forming a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a> with the pied currawong.

Common names include black currawong, sooty currawong, black bell-magpie, black or mountain magpie, black or sooty crow-shrike, and muttonbird. Black jay is a local name applied to the species within Tasmania. The species is often confused with the local dark-plumaged subspecies of the <a href="grey%20currawong">grey currawong</a> ("S. versicolor"), known as the clinking currawong or hill magpie.

There are three subspecies of the black currawong: the <a href="subspecies%23Nominate%20subspecies">nominate</a> form "Strepera fuliginosa fuliginosa" of Tasmania; "Strepera fuliginosa parvior" of <a href="Flinders%20Island%2C%20Tasmania">Flinders Island</a>, described by Schodde and Mason in 1999; and "Strepera fuliginosa colei" of <a href="King%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">King Island</a>, described by <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> in 1916. The two island subspecies have identical plumage to the nominate, but are slightly smaller with shorter wings and tails, subspecies "colei" having a shorter tail than "parvior".

Together with the pied and grey currawong, the black currawong forms the genus "<a href="Strepera">Strepera</a>". Although <a href="Corvidae">crow</a>-like in appearance and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and are instead closely related to the <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a> and the <a href="butcherbird">butcherbird</a>s. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist <a href="John%20Albert%20Leach">John Albert Leach</a> after he had studied their musculature. Ornithologists <a href="Charles%20Sibley">Charles Sibley</a> and <a href="Jon%20Edward%20Ahlquist">Jon Ahlquist</a> recognised the close relationship between the <a href="woodswallow">woodswallow</a>s and the butcherbirds and relatives in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini <a href="clade">clade</a>, which later became the family <a href="Artamidae">Artamidae</a>.

The black currawong is about long with an wingspan. The male is slightly larger and heavier than the female; males of the nominate subspecies average to females' . Male wings average around and tails , while female wings average and tails . Data for the two island subspecies is limited, but males of subspecies "colei" have been measured at with wings on average, and a female at with a wing, and subspecies "parvior" at for males with wings on average, and and wing for a female. The sexes are similar in plumage, which is all black except for white patches at the <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">tips of the wings</a> and <a href="Flight%20feather%23Rectrices">tail feather</a>s. The bill and legs are black and the eyes bright yellow. The white tips line the trailing edges of the wings in flight, and a paler arc across the bases of the primary flight feathers is also visible on the underwing. Although there is no seasonal variation to the plumage, the black may fade a little to a dark brown with wear. Immature birds have browner-tinged plumage, and a yellow <a href="gape">gape</a> until they are two years old. The oldest recorded age of a black currawong has been 15 years; a bird was sighted in July 2004 near <a href="Fern%20Tree%2C%20Tasmania">Fern Tree, Tasmania</a>, less than from where it had been banded in July 1989.

The black currawong is a loud and vocal species, and makes a variety of calls. Its main call is markedly different from the pied or grey currawongs and has been described as a combination of alternating "kar" and "wheek" sounds, "killok killok", or even akin to part song and part human laughter. Although often noisy when flying in flocks, it can be silent when seeking prey or thieving food. Before or around dawn and at nightfall appear to be periods of increased calling, and birds are reported to be more vocal before rain or storms. Parents also make a long fluting whistle to summon their young.

The black currawong is commonly confused with the clinking currawong, but the latter species has a white rump and larger white wing patches. The black currawong has a heavier bill and a characteristic call unlike the clink-clink call of the clinking. The <a href="forest%20raven">forest</a> and <a href="little%20raven">little raven</a>s are similar in size but lack the white wing patches, and instead have entirely black plumage and white, rather than yellow eyes. The black currawong is unlikely to be mistaken for the closely related <a href="pied%20currawong">pied currawong</a> as the latter does not reach Tasmania, but it has a longer and deeper bill and lacks the white rump and undertail coverts.

The black currawong is <a href="Endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> to Tasmania where it is widespread, although it is uncommon or absent from areas below altitude. It breeds mainly in the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Tasmania%29">Central Highlands</a>, with scattered records elsewhere in Tasmania. Reports of breeding are rare from the northeast. It is found on many islands of <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a>, including the Hunter and <a href="Furneaux%20Group">Furneaux Group</a>s. It was recorded historically from the <a href="Kent%20Group">Kent Group</a>, but its status there is unknown. Within its range it is largely sedentary, although some populations at higher altitudes may move to lower altitudes during winter. Flocks have also been recorded making the long journey across water from <a href="Maria%20Island">Maria Island</a> to the mainland in the morning and returning at nightfall, as well as moving between islands in the <a href="Maatsuyker%20Islands">Maatsuyker group</a>. The black currawong has expanded into the northeast corner of the island, to Musselroe Bay and <a href="Cape%20Portland%2C%20Tasmania">Cape Portland</a>.

The black currawong is evaluated as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> of Threatened Species. One of its subspecies, "Strepera fuliginosa colei" of King Island, has declined over much of its range on King Island, possibly due to clearing of its forest habitat, and has been listed as <a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a>. There are estimated to be around 500 birds. It is unclear whether competition with the more numerous <a href="forest%20raven">forest raven</a> is impacting on the subspecies there.

The black currawong is generally found in wetter eucalypt forests, dominated by such species as alpine ash ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20delegatensis">Eucalyptus delegatensis</a>"), messmate ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20obliqua">E. obliqua</a>"), and mountain gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20dalrympleana">E. dalrympleana</a>"), sometimes with a beech ("<a href="Nothofagus">Nothofagus</a>") <a href="understory">understory</a>. It also frequents cool rainforest of beech, king billy pine ("<a href="Athrotaxis%20selaginoides">Athrotaxis selaginoides</a>"). In lowlands it is more restricted to denser forests and moist <a href="Gully">gullies</a>, while it also occurs in alpine <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a> and heathland at altitude. In dryer more open forest, it is replaced by the clinking currawong, although the two may co-occur in places such as the Central Highlands and Eastern Tiers. Both the Flinders and King island subspecies are found across their respective islands, but prefer more forested habitats there. The black currawong has been recorded in gardens in <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a> in Tasmania's southeast, and around <a href="Mount%20Wellington%20%28Tasmania%29">Mount Wellington</a>, on Hobart's outskirts, in winter. Some remained to breed in Hobart in 1994 after a year of severe weather.

Black currawongs are found singly or in pairs, but may gather into groups of 20 to 80 birds. Birds have been observed digging wet yellow clay out of a drain and applying it all over their plumage. Wiping the carpal areas of wings in particular with their bills, they did not appear to wash afterwards, using the procedure as a form of dirt bath. The black currawong has an undulating flight pattern in time with its wing beats, and often cocks its tail in the air for balance when it lands. Play behaviour has been observed, particularly with subadult individuals. Black currawongs have been observed wrestling with each other, where a bird would attempt to force its opponent on its back, at <a href="Maydena%2C%20Tasmania">Maydena</a>, while others have been reported rolling on their backs and juggling with food items such as <a href="pear">pear</a>s with their feet.

One species of <a href="chewing%20louse">chewing lice</a>, "<a href="Australophilopterus%20curviconus">Australophilopterus curviconus</a>", has been recovered and described from a black currawong near <a href="Launceston%2C%20Tasmania">Launceston</a>.

Breeding occurs from August to December. Like all currawongs, it builds a large cup-nest out of sticks, lined with softer material, and placed in the fork of a tree from high. Old nests are sometimes tidied up and reused in following years. A typical <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> has two to four pale grey-brown, purplish-<a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a>, spotted, blotched red-brown or purplish-brown eggs. As in all <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, the chicks are born naked, and blind (<a href="altricial">altricial</a>), and remain in the nest for an extended period (<a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a>). Both parents feed the young, but the male feeds them alone after leaving the nest and as they become more independent, and also moves from giving food directly to them to placing it on the ground near them so they learn to eat for themselves.

No systematic studies have been done on the diet of the black currawong, but it is known to be omnivorous, feeding on a wide variety of foodstuffs including insects and small vertebrates, carrion, and berries. Birds forage on the ground most often, but also in tree canopies. They use their bills to probe the ground or turn over clods of earth or small rocks looking for food. Birds have been seen using walking tracks to forage along. A group of ten birds were observed trying to break open ice on a frozen lake. They have been recorded foraging along the beach for fly larvae in beached kelp. Most commonly, black currawongs forage in pairs, but they may congregate in larger groups—flocks of 100 birds have descended on orchards to eat apples or rotten fruit. The species has been observed in a <a href="Mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species flocks</a> with forest ravens ("Corvus tasmanicus"), and <a href="silver%20gull">silver gull</a>s ("Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae"), <a href="white-faced%20heron">white-faced heron</a>s ("Egretta novaehollandiae"), <a href="white-fronted%20chat">white-fronted chat</a>s ("Epthianura albifrons"), and <a href="European%20starling">European starling</a>s ("Sturnus vulgaris") on the beach at Sundown Point. They have been observed securing dead larger prey to ease subsequent dismemberment; a parent currawong had wedged a dead chicken's wings under a log to facilitate pulling off portions such as legs and entrails to feed to its young, and another time hooked a dead rabbit on a spur of a log to rip it into pieces.

The black currawong consumes the berries of the <a href="Ericaceae">heath</a> species "<a href="Leptecophylla%20juniperina">Leptecophylla juniperina</a>", and "<a href="Astroloma%20humifusum">Astroloma humifusum</a>", and the native sedge "<a href="Gahnia%20grandis">Gahnia grandis</a>", as well as domestic pea, and apples. Invertebrates consumed include earthworms (<a href="Lumbricidae">Lumbricidae</a>) and many types of insects, such as ants, moths, flies, crickets, grasshoppers and beetles like weevils, scarabs and leaf beetles. It is adaptable, and has learnt to eat the introduced European wasp ("<a href="Vespula%20germanica">Vespula germanica</a>"). A bird that was being harassed by three <a href="scarlet%20robin">scarlet robin</a>s ("Petroica boodang") was seen to suddenly turn on them and catch and eat one. Other vertebrates recorded as prey include the <a href="house%20mouse">house mouse</a> ("Mus musculus"), small lizards, tadpoles, chickens, ducklings, the young of domestic turkey, <a href="Tasmanian%20nativehen">Tasmanian nativehen</a> ("Gallinula mortierii"), <a href="flame%20robin">flame robin</a> ("Petroica phoenicea") and rabbit.

It can become quite bold and tame, much like its close relative, the <a href="pied%20currawong">pied currawong</a> on the Australian mainland, especially in public parks and gardens where people make a habit of feeding it. Black currawongs have been recorded taking young peas from pods, raiding orchards, seizing chickens from poultry yards, and entering barns in search of mice.

Black currawongs are very common around picnic areas in Tasmania's two most popular National Parks, <a href="Freycinet%20National%20Park">Freycinet</a> and <a href="Cradle%20Mountain-Lake%20St%20Clair%20National%20Park">Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair</a>, and are often fed by tourists there. The National Parks Authority tolerated this practice until 1995, when they found the birds were becoming a nuisance and began discouraging people from feeding wildlife. However, the agile currawongs are adept at snatching fragments of food left by picnickers so the birds may only ultimately be discouraged by an (impractical) ban on food in National Parks. Birds also take other items such as soap or cutlery from campsites to examine.

Pied currawong

The pied currawong ("Strepera graculina") is a medium-sized black <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird native to <a href="eastern%20Australia">eastern Australia</a> and <a href="Lord%20Howe%20Island">Lord Howe Island</a>. One of three <a href="currawong">currawong</a> species in the genus "Strepera", it is closely related to the <a href="butcherbird">butcherbird</a>s and <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a> of the family <a href="Artamidae">Artamidae</a>. Six subspecies are recognised. It is a robust crowlike bird averaging around in length, black or sooty grey-black in plumage with white undertail and wing patches, yellow irises, and a heavy bill. The male and female are similar in appearance. Known for its melodious calls, the species' name "currawong" is believed to be of <a href="Indigenous%20Australian%20languages">indigenous</a> origin.

Within its range, the pied currawong is generally <a href="Bird%20migration">sedentary</a>, although populations at higher altitudes relocate to lower areas during the cooler months. It is <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a>, with a diet that includes a wide variety of berries and seeds, <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, bird eggs, juvenile birds and young marsupials. It is a predator which has adapted well to urbanization and can be found in parks and gardens as well as rural woodland. The habitat includes all kinds of forested areas, although mature forests are preferred for breeding. Roosting, nesting and the bulk of foraging take place in trees, in contrast with the ground-foraging behaviour of its relative, the Australian magpie.

The pied currawong was first described by English ornithologist <a href="George%20Shaw">George Shaw</a> in 1790 as "Coracias strepera", although "Strepera" was adopted as a <a href="genus">generic</a> name. Its <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> names were derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "strepera", meaning "noisy", and "graculina" for resembling a <a href="jackdaw">jackdaw</a>. Pied crow-shrike is an old vernacular name from colonial days, and the term "pied" refers to two or more colors in blotches. Other <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s include pied chillawong, currawang, charawack, kurrawack, tallawong, tullawong, mutton-bird, Otway forester, and pied afternoon-tea bird. The <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a> term "currawong" itself is derived from the bird's call. However, the exact origin of the term is unclear; the most likely antecedent is the word "garrawaŋ" from the indigenous <a href="Turrubal%20language">Jagera language</a> from the Brisbane region, although the <a href="Sydney%20language">Darug</a> word "gurawaruŋ" from the Sydney basin is a possibility. "Yungang" as well as "Kurrawang" and "Kurrawah" are names from the <a href="Tharawal%20people">Tharawal people</a> of the Illawarra region.

Its closest relative is the <a href="black%20currawong">black currawong</a> ("S. fuliginosa") of Tasmania, which has sometimes been considered a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>. Together with the larger <a href="grey%20currawong">grey currawong</a> ("S. versicolor"), they form the genus "Strepera". Although <a href="Corvidae">crow</a>-like in appearance and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and instead belong to the family <a href="Artamidae">Artamidae</a>, together with the closely related <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a> and the <a href="butcherbird">butcherbird</a>s. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they were placed in the family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist <a href="John%20Albert%20Leach">John Albert Leach</a> after he had studied their musculature. Ornithologists <a href="Charles%20Sibley">Charles Sibley</a> and <a href="Jon%20Edward%20Ahlquist">Jon Ahlquist</a> recognised the close relationship between <a href="woodswallow">woodswallow</a>s and butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini <a href="clade">clade</a>, which became the family Artamidae.

Six subspecies are currently recognised, characterised principally by differences in size and plumage. There is a steady change to the birds' morphology and size the further south they are encountered, with lighter and more greyish <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, larger body size, and a shorter bill. Southerly populations also show more white plumage in the tail, with less whiteness on the wing.



The pied currawong is generally a black bird with white in the wing, undertail <a href="covert%20%28feather%29">coverts</a>, the base of the tail and most visibly, the tip of the tail. It has yellow eyes. Adult birds are in length, with an average of around ; the wingspan varies from , averaging around . Adult males average around , females . The wings are long and broad. The long and heavy <a href="beak">bill</a> is about one and a half times as long as the head and is hooked at the end. Juvenile birds have similar markings to adults but have softer and brownish plumage overall, although the white band on the tail is narrower. The upperparts are darker brown with scallops and streaks over the head and neck, and the underparts lighter brown. The eyes are dark brown and the bill dark with a yellow tip. The <a href="gape">gape</a> is a prominent yellow. Older birds grow darker until adult plumage is achieved, but juvenile tail markings only change to adult late in development. Birds appear to moult once a year in late summer after breeding. The pied currawong can live for over 20 years in the wild.

Pied currawongs are vocal birds, calling when in flight and at all times of the day. They are more noisy early in the morning and in the evening before roosting, as well as before rain. The loud distinctive call has been translated as "Kadow-Kadang" or "Curra-wong", akin to a croak. They also have a loud, high-pitched, wolf-like whistle, transcribed as "Wheeo". The endemic Lord Howe Island subspecies has a distinct, more melodious call.

The smaller <a href="white-winged%20chough">white-winged chough</a> has similar plumage but has red eyes and is found mainly on the ground. Australian crow and raven species have white eyes and lack the white rump, and the similar-sized <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a> has red eyes and prominent black and white plumage. The larger <a href="grey%20currawong">grey currawong</a> is readily distinguished by its lighter grey overall plumage and lack of white feathers at the base of the tail. In northwestern Victoria, the black-winged currawong (subspecies "melanoptera" of the grey) does have a darker plumage than other grey subspecies, but its wings lack the white primaries of the pied currawong.

The pied currawong is common in both wet and dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forests, rural and semi-urban environments throughout eastern Australia, from <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> to western <a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia">Victoria</a> and <a href="Lord%20Howe%20Island">Lord Howe Island</a>, where it occurs as an <a href="endemic%20%28ecology%29">endemic</a> subspecies. It has adapted well to European presence, and has become more common in many areas of eastern Australia, with surveys in <a href="Nanango%2C%20Queensland">Nanango, Queensland</a>, <a href="Barham%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Barham, New South Wales</a>, <a href="Geelong">Geelong</a>, <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, as well as the <a href="Northern%20Tablelands%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Northern Tablelands</a> and <a href="South%20West%20Slopes%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">South West Slopes</a> regions in New South Wales, all showing an increase in population. This increase has been most marked, however, in Sydney and Canberra since the 1940s and 1960s, respectively. In both cities, the species had previously been a winter resident only, but now remains year-round and breeds there. They are a dominant species and common inhabitant of Sydney gardens.

In general, the pied currawong is sedentary, although some populations from higher altitudes move to areas of lower elevation in winter. However, evidence for the extent of migration is conflicting, and the species' movements have been little studied to date. More recently still, a survey of the population of pied currawongs in southeastern Queensland between 1980 and 2000 had found the species had become more numerous there, including suburban Brisbane. One 1992 survey reported the total number of pied currawongs in Australia had doubled from three million birds in the 1960s to six million in the early 1990s.

The pied currawong is able to cross bodies of water of some size, as it has been recorded from <a href="Rodondo%20Island">Rodondo Island</a>, which lies off the coast of <a href="Wilsons%20Promontory">Wilsons Promontory</a> in Victoria, as well as some offshore islands in Queensland. It has disappeared from <a href="Tryon%20Island">Tryon</a>, <a href="North%20West%20Island">North West</a>, <a href="Masthead%20Island">Masthead</a> and <a href="Heron%20Island%2C%20Australia">Heron Islands</a> in the
<a href="Capricorn%20and%20Bunker%20Group%23Capricorn%20Group">Capricorn Group</a> on the Great Barrier Reef. The presence of the Lord Howe subspecies is possibly the result of a chance landing there.

The pied currawong's impact on smaller birds that are vulnerable to nest predation is controversial: several studies have suggested that the species has become a serious problem, but the truth of this widely held perception was queried in a 2001 review of the published literature on their foraging habits by Bayly and Blumstein of Macquarie University, who observed that common <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> birds were more affected than native birds. However, predation by pied currawongs has been a factor in the decline of <a href="Gould%27s%20petrel">Gould's petrel</a> at a colony on <a href="Cabbage%20Tree%20Island">Cabbage Tree Island</a>, near <a href="Port%20Stephens%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Port Stephens</a> in New South Wales; currawongs have been reported preying on adult seabirds. Their removal from the islands halted a decline of the threatened petrels. Furthermore, a University of New England study published in 2006 reported that the breeding success rates for the <a href="eastern%20yellow%20robin">eastern yellow robin</a> ("Eopsaltria australis") and <a href="scarlet%20robin">scarlet robin</a> ("Petroica boodang") on the New England Tablelands were improved after nests were protected and currawongs culled, and some yellow robins even re-colonised an area where they had become locally extinct. The presence of pied currawongs in Sydney gardens is negatively correlated with the presence of <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a>s ("Zosterops lateralis").

The species has been implicated in the spread of weeds by consuming and dispersing fruit and seed. In the first half of the twentieth century, pied currawongs were shot as they were considered pests of corn and strawberry crops, as well as assisting in the spread of the <a href="Opuntia">prickly pear</a>. They were also shot on Lord Howe Island for attacking chickens. However, they are seen as beneficial in <a href="forestry">forestry</a> as they consume <a href="Phasmatodea">phasmids</a>, and also in agriculture for eating cocoons of the <a href="codling%20moth">codling moth</a>.

Pied currawongs are generally tree-dwelling, hunting and foraging some metres above the ground, and thus able to share territory with the ground-foraging <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a>. Birds roost in forested areas or large trees at night, disperse to forage in the early morning and return in the late afternoon. Although often solitary or encountered in small groups, the species may form larger flocks of fifty or more birds in autumn and winter. On the ground, a pied currawong hops or struts.

During the breeding season, pied currawongs will pair up and become territorial, defending both nesting and feeding areas. A 1994 study in Sydney's leafy northern suburbs measured an average distance of between nests, while another in Canberra in 1990 had three pairs in a segment of pine-tree lined street. Territories have been measured around 0.5–0.7 <a href="hectare">ha</a> in Sydney and Wollongong, although these were restricted to nesting areas and did not include a larger feeding territory, and 7.9 ha in Canberra. Pied currawongs vigorously drive off threats such as ravens, and engage in bill-snapping, dive-bombing and aerial pursuit. They adopt a specific <a href="threat%20display">threat display</a> against other currawongs by lowering the head so the head and body are parallel to the ground and pointing the beak out forward, often directly at the intruder. The male predominates in threat displays and territorial defence, and guards the female closely as she builds the nest.

Flocks of birds appear to engage in play; one routine involves a bird perching atop a tall tree, pole or spire, and others swooping, tumbling or diving and attempting to dislodge it. A successful challenger is then challenged in its turn by other birds in the flock.

The pied currawong bathes by wading into water up to deep, squatting down, ducking its head under, and shaking its wings. It preens its plumage afterwards, sometimes applying mud or soil first. The species has also been observed <a href="anting%20%28bird%20activity%29">anting</a>.

Although found in many types of woodland, the pied currawong prefers to breed in mature forests. It builds a nest of thin sticks lined with grass and bark high in trees in spring; generally eucalypts are chosen and never isolated ones. It produces a <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of three <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a>; they are a light pinkish-brown colour (likened by one author to that of <a href="silly%20putty">silly putty</a>) with splotches of darker pink-brown and lavender. Tapered oval in shape, they measure about . The female broods alone. The <a href="Avian%20incubation">incubation</a> period is not well known, due to the difficulty of observing nests, but observations indicate around 30 days from laying to hatching. Like all <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, the chicks are born naked, and blind (<a href="altricial">altricial</a>), and remain in the nest for an extended period (<a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a>) They quickly grow a layer of ashy-grey down. Both parents feed the young, although the male does not begin to feed them directly until a few days after birth.

The <a href="channel-billed%20cuckoo">channel-billed cuckoo</a> ("Scythrops novaehollandiae") parasitizes pied currawong nests, laying eggs which are then raised by the unsuspecting foster parents. The eggs closely resemble those of the currawong hosts. Pied currawongs have been known to desert nests once cuckoos have visited, abandoning the existing currawong young, which die, and a channel-billed cuckoo has been recorded decapitating a currawong nestling. The <a href="brown%20goshawk">brown goshawk</a> ("Accipiter fasciatus") and <a href="lace%20monitor">lace monitor</a> ("Varanus varius") have also been recorded taking nestlings.

The pied currawong is an omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, eating fruit and berries as well as preying on many invertebrates, and smaller vertebrates, mostly juvenile birds and bird eggs, although they may take healthy adult birds up to the size of a <a href="Crested%20Pigeon">Crested Pigeon</a> on occasion. Currawongs will hunt in trees, snatching birds and eggs from nests, as well as insects and berries from trees. They also hunt in the air and on the ground. Insects predominate in the diet during summer months, and fruit during the winter. They will often scavenge, eating scraps and rubbish and can be quite bold when seeking food from people, lingering around picnic areas and bird-feeding trays. Beetles and ants are the most common types of insects consumed. Pied currawongs have been recorded taking mice, as well as chickens and turkeys from farms. The pied currawong consumes fruit, including a wide variety of figs, such as the Moreton Bay ("<a href="Ficus%20macrophylla">Ficus macrophylla</a>"), Port Jackson ("<a href="Ficus%20rubiginosa">F. rubiginosa</a>"), Banyan ("<a href="Ficus%20virens">F. virens</a>") and Strangler fig ("<a href="Ficus%20watkinsiana">F. watkinsiana</a>"), as well as lillypillies ("<a href="Syzygium">Syzygium</a>" species), white cedar ("<a href="Melia%20azedarach">Melia azedarach</a>"), plum pine ("<a href="Podocarpus%20elatus">Podocarpus elatus</a>"), and geebungs ("<a href="Persoonia">Persoonia</a>" species). Other fruit is also sought after, and currawongs have been known to raid orchards, eating apples, pears, strawberries, grapes, stone fruit, citrus, and corn. Pied currawongs have been responsible for the spread of the invasive ornamental "<a href="Asparagus%20aethiopicus">Asparagus aethiopicus</a>" (often called "A. densiflorus") in the Sydney area, the weedy <a href="privet">privet</a> species "<a href="Ligustrum%20lucidum">Ligustrum lucidum</a>" and "<a href="Ligustrum%20sinense">L. sinense</a>", and firethorn species "<a href="Pyracantha%20angustifolia">Pyracantha angustifolia</a>" and "<a href="Pyracantha%20rogersiana">P. rogersiana</a>" around <a href="Armidale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Armidale</a>.

Birds forage singly or in pairs in summer, and more often in larger flocks in autumn and winter, during which time they are more likely to loiter around people and urban areas. They occasionally associate with Australian magpies ("Gymnorhina tibicen") or <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a>s ("Sturnus vulgaris") when foraging. Birds have also been encountered with <a href="grey%20currawong">grey currawong</a>s ("S. versicolor") and <a href="satin%20bowerbird">satin bowerbird</a>s ("Ptilinorhynchus violaceus"). The species has been reported <a href="kleptoparasitism">stealing food</a> from other birds such as the <a href="Australian%20hobby">Australian hobby</a> ("Falco longipennis"), <a href="collared%20sparrowhawk">collared sparrowhawk</a> ("Accipiter cirrocephalus"), and <a href="sulphur-crested%20cockatoo">sulphur-crested cockatoo</a> ("Cacatua galerita"). Pied currawongs will also harass each other. A 2007 study conducted by researchers from the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> showed that <a href="white-browed%20scrubwren">white-browed scrubwren</a> ("Sericornis frontalis") nestlings became silent when they heard the recorded sound of a pied currawong walking through leaf litter.

Augusta, Lady Gregory

Isabella Augusta, Lady Gregory ("née" Persse; 15 March 1852 – 22 May 1932) was an Irish <a href="dramatist">dramatist</a>, <a href="Folklore">folklorist</a> and theatre manager. With <a href="William%20Butler%20Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a> and <a href="Edward%20Martyn">Edward Martyn</a>, she co-founded the <a href="Irish%20Literary%20Theatre">Irish Literary Theatre</a> and the <a href="Abbey%20Theatre">Abbey Theatre</a>, and wrote numerous short works for both companies. Lady Gregory produced a number of books of retellings of stories taken from <a href="Irish%20mythology">Irish mythology</a>. Born into a class that identified closely with British rule, she turned against it. Her conversion to cultural nationalism, as evidenced by her writings, was emblematic of many of the political struggles to occur in Ireland during her lifetime.

Lady Gregory is mainly remembered for her work behind the <a href="Irish%20Literary%20Revival">Irish Literary Revival</a>. Her home at <a href="Coole%20Park">Coole Park</a> in <a href="County%20Galway">County Galway</a> served as an important meeting place for leading Revival figures, and her early work as a member of the board of the Abbey was at least as important as her creative writings for that theatre's development. Lady Gregory's motto was taken from <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>: "To think like a wise man, but to express oneself like the common people.".

Gregory was born at Roxborough, <a href="County%20Galway">County Galway</a>, the youngest daughter of the <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> gentry family Persse. Her mother, Frances Barry, was related to <a href="Standish%20O%27Grady%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Guillamore">Viscount Guillamore</a>, and her family home, Roxborough, was a 6,000-acre (24 km²) estate located between <a href="Gort">Gort</a> and <a href="Loughrea">Loughrea</a>, the main house of which was later burnt down during the <a href="Irish%20Civil%20War">Irish Civil War</a>. She was educated at home, and her future career was strongly influenced by the family nurse (i.e. <a href="nanny">nanny</a>), Mary Sheridan, a Catholic and a <a href="Irish%20language">native Irish speaker</a>, who introduced the young Augusta to the history and legends of the local area.

She married <a href="William%20Henry%20Gregory">Sir William Henry Gregory</a>, a widower with an estate at <a href="Coole%20Park">Coole Park</a>, near Gort, on 4 March 1880 in St Matthias' Church, Dublin. Sir William, who was 35 years her elder, had just retired from his position as Governor of <a href="British%20Ceylon">Ceylon</a> (now Sri Lanka), having previously served several terms as Member of Parliament for County Galway. He was a well-educated man with many literary and artistic interests, and the house at Coole Park housed a large library and extensive art collection, both of which Lady Gregory was eager to explore. He also had a house in London, where the couple spent a considerable amount of time, holding weekly <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salons</a> frequented by many leading literary and artistic figures of the day, including <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Tennyson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tennyson">Lord Tennyson</a>, <a href="John%20Everett%20Millais">John Everett Millais</a> and <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>. Their only child, <a href="Robert%20Gregory%20%28cricketer%29">Robert Gregory</a>, was born in 1881. He was killed during the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> while serving as a pilot, an event which inspired <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>'s poems "An Irish Airman Foresees His Death", "In Memory of Major Robert Gregory" and "Shepherd and Goatherd".

The Gregorys travelled in Ceylon, India, Spain, Italy and Egypt. While in Egypt, Lady Gregory had an affair with the English poet <a href="Wilfrid%20Scawen%20Blunt">Wilfrid Scawen Blunt</a>, during which she wrote a series of love poems, "A Woman's Sonnets".

Her earliest work to appear under her own name was "Arabi and His Household" (1882), a pamphlet—originally a letter to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>"—in support of <a href="Ahmed%20%27Urabi">Ahmed Orabi Pasha</a>, leader of what has come to be known as the <a href="Urabi%20Revolt">Urabi Revolt</a>, an 1879 Egyptian nationalist revolt against the oppressive regime of the <a href="Khedive">Khedive</a> and the European domination of Egypt. She later said of this booklet, "whatever political indignation or energy was born with me may have run its course in that Egyptian year and worn itself out". Despite this, in 1893 she published "A Phantom's Pilgrimage, or Home Ruin", an anti-Nationalist pamphlet against <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a>'s proposed second <a href="Home%20Rule">Home Rule</a> Act.

She continued to write prose during the period of her marriage. During the winter of 1883, whilst her husband was in Ceylon, she worked on a series of memoirs of her childhood home, with a view to publishing them under the title "An Emigrant's Notebook", but this plan was abandoned. She wrote a series of pamphlets in 1887 called "Over the River", in which she appealed for funds for the parish of St. Stephens in <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a>, south London. She also wrote a number of short stories in the years 1890 and 1891, although these also never appeared in print. A number of unpublished poems from this period have also survived. When Sir William Gregory died in March 1892, Lady Gregory went into mourning and returned to Coole Park; there she edited her husband's autobiography, which she published in 1894. She was to write later, "If I had not married I should not have learned the quick enrichment of sentences that one gets in conversation; had I not been widowed I should not have found the detachment of mind, the leisure for observation necessary to give insight into character, to express and interpret it. Loneliness made me rich—'full', as Bacon says.".

A trip to <a href="Inisheer">Inisheer</a> in the <a href="Aran%20Islands">Aran Islands</a> in 1893 re-awoke for Lady Gregory an interest in the Irish language and in the folklore of the area in which she lived. She organised Irish lessons at the school at Coole, and began collecting tales from the area around her home, especially from the residents of Gort <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>. One of the tutors she employed was <a href="Norma%20Borthwick">Norma Borthwick</a>, who would visit Coole numerous times. This activity led to the publication of a number of volumes of folk material, including "A Book of Saints and Wonders" (1906), "The Kiltartan History Book" (1909) and "The Kiltartan Wonder Book" (1910). She also produced a number of collections of "Kiltartanese" versions of Irish myths, including "<a href="Cuchulain%20of%20Muirthemne">Cuchulain of Muirthemne</a>" (1902) and "Gods and Fighting Men" (1904). ("Kiltartanese" is Lady Gregory's term for English with Gaelic syntax, based on the dialect spoken in <a href="Kiltartan">Kiltartan</a>.) In his introduction to the former, Yeats wrote "I think this book is the best that has come out of Ireland in my time.". <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a> was to parody this claim in the <a href="Scylla%20and%20Charybdis">Scylla and Charybdis</a> chapter of his novel "<a href="Ulysses%20%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>".

Towards the end of 1894, encouraged by the positive reception of the editing of her husband's autobiography, Lady Gregory turned her attention to another editorial project. She decided to prepare selections from Sir William Gregory's grandfather's correspondence for publication as "Mr Gregory's Letter-Box 1813–30" (1898). This entailed her researching Irish history of the period; one outcome of this work was a shift in her political position, from the "soft" <a href="Unionism%20%28Ireland%29">Unionism</a> of her earlier writing on Home Rule to a definite support of <a href="Irish%20nationalism">Irish nationalism</a> and <a href="Irish%20Republicanism">Republicanism</a>, and to what she was later to describe as "a dislike and distrust of England".

<a href="Edward%20Martyn">Edward Martyn</a> was a neighbour of Lady Gregory, and it was during a visit to his home, Tullira Castle, in 1896 that she first met W. B. Yeats. Discussions between the three of them, over the following year or so, led to the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899. Lady Gregory undertook fundraising, and the first programme consisted of Martyn's "The Heather Field" and Yeats's "<a href="The%20Countess%20Cathleen">The Countess Cathleen</a>".

The Irish Literary Theatre project lasted until 1901, when it collapsed owing to lack of funding. In 1904, Lady Gregory, Martyn, Yeats, <a href="John%20Millington%20Synge">John Millington Synge</a>, <a href="George%20William%20Russell">Æ</a>, <a href="Annie%20Horniman">Annie Horniman</a> and <a href="William%20Fay">William</a> and <a href="Frank%20Fay%20%28Irish%20actor%29">Frank Fay</a> came together to form the <a href="Irish%20National%20Theatre%20Society">Irish National Theatre Society</a>. The first performances staged by the society took place in a building called the Molesworth Hall. When the <a href="Mechanics%27%20Theatre">Hibernian Theatre of Varieties</a> in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in <a href="Marlborough%20Street%2C%20Dublin">Marlborough Street</a> became available, Horniman and William Fay agreed to their purchase and refitting to meet the needs of the society.

On 11 May 1904, the society formally accepted Horniman's offer of the use of the building. As Horniman was not normally resident in Ireland, the Royal <a href="Letters%20patent">Letters Patent</a> required were paid for by her but granted in the name of Lady Gregory. One of her own plays, "<a href="Spreading%20the%20News">Spreading the News</a>", was performed on the opening night, 27 December 1904. At the opening of Synge's "<a href="The%20Playboy%20of%20the%20Western%20World">The Playboy of the Western World</a>" in January 1907, a significant portion of the crowd rioted, causing the remainder of the performances to be acted out in <a href="dumbshow">dumbshow</a>. Lady Gregory did not think as highly of the play as Yeats did, but she defended Synge as a matter of principle. Her view of the affair is summed up in a letter to Yeats where she wrote of the riots: "It is the old battle, between those who use a toothbrush and those who don't."

Lady Gregory remained an active director of the theatre until ill-health led to her retirement in 1928. During this time she wrote more than 19 plays, mainly for production at the Abbey. Many of these were written in an attempted transliteration of the <a href="Hiberno-English">Hiberno-English</a> dialect spoken around Coole Park that became widely known as Kiltartanese, from the nearby village of <a href="Kiltartan">Kiltartan</a>. Her plays had been among the most successful at the Abbey in the earlier years, but their popularity declined. Indeed, the Irish writer <a href="Oliver%20St.%20John%20Gogarty">Oliver St. John Gogarty</a> once wrote "the perpetual presentation of her plays nearly ruined the Abbey". In addition to her plays, she wrote a two-volume study of the folklore of her native area called "Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland" in 1920. She also played the lead role in three performances of "Cathleen Ni Houlihan" in 1919.

During her time on the board of the Abbey, Coole Park remained her home; she spent her time in Dublin staying in a number of hotels. For example, at the time of the 1911 national census, she was staying in a hotel at 16 South Frederick Street. In these she dined frugally, often on food she had brought with her from home. She frequently used her hotel rooms to interview would-be Abbey dramatists and to entertain the company after opening nights of new plays. She spent many of her days working on her translations in the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Ireland">National Library of Ireland</a>. She gained a reputation as being a somewhat conservative figure. For example, when <a href="Denis%20Johnston">Denis Johnston</a> submitted to the Abbey his first play, "Shadowdance", it was rejected by Lady Gregory and returned to the author with "The Old Lady says No" written on the title page. Johnston decided to rename the play, and "The Old Lady Says 'No!' " was eventually staged by the <a href="Gate%20Theatre">Gate Theatre</a> in 1928.

When she retired from the Abbey board, Lady Gregory returned to live in Galway, although she continued to visit Dublin regularly. The house and <a href="demesne">demesne</a> at Coole Park had been sold to the <a href="Coillte%20Teoranta">Irish Forestry Commission</a> in 1927, with Lady Gregory retaining life tenancy. Her Galway home had long been a focal point for the writers associated with the Irish Literary Revival, and this continued after her retirement. On a tree in what were the grounds of the house, one can still see the carved initials of Synge, Æ, Yeats and his artist brother <a href="Jack%20Yeats">Jack</a>, <a href="George%20A.%20Moore">George Moore</a>, <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20O%27Casey">Seán O'Casey</a>, <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a>, <a href="Katharine%20Tynan">Katharine Tynan</a> and <a href="Violet%20Martin">Violet Martin</a>. Yeats wrote five poems about, or set in, the house and grounds: "The Wild Swans at Coole", "I walked among the seven woods of Coole", "In the Seven Woods", "Coole Park, 1929" and "Coole Park and Ballylee, 1931".

Lady Gregory, whom Shaw once described as "the greatest living Irishwoman", died at home aged 80 from <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a>, and is buried in the New Cemetery in <a href="Bohermore">Bohermore</a>, <a href="County%20Galway">County Galway</a>. The entire contents of Coole Park were auctioned three months after her death, and the house was demolished in 1941.

Her plays fell out of favour after her death, and are now rarely performed. Many of the diaries and journals she kept for most of her adult life have been published, providing a rich source of information on Irish literary history during the first three decades of the 20th century.

Her "<a href="Cuchulain%20of%20Muirthemne">Cuchulain of Muirthemne</a>" is still considered a good retelling of the <a href="Ulster%20Cycle">Ulster Cycle</a> tales such as <a href="Deidre">Deidre</a>, <a href="Cuchulainn">Cuchulainn</a>, and the <a href="T%C3%A1in%20B%C3%B3%20C%C3%BAailnge">Táin Bó Cúailnge</a> stories. <a href="Thomas%20Kinsella">Thomas Kinsella</a> wrote ""I emerged with the conviction that Lady Gregory's 'Cuchulian of Muirthemne', though only a paraphrase, gave the best idea of the Ulster stories"". However her version omitted some elements of the tale, usually assumed to avoid offending Victorian sensibilities, as well being an attempt as presenting a 'respectable' nation myth for the Irish, though her paraphrase is not considered dishonest. Other critics find the <a href="bowdlerisation">bowdlerisation</a>s in her works more offensive, not only the removal of references to sex and bodily functions, but also the loss of Cuchulain's "battle frenzy" ("<a href="R%C3%ADastrad">Ríastrad</a>"); in other areas she censored less than some of her male contemporaries, such as <a href="Standish%20James%20O%27Grady">Standish O'Grady</a>.
