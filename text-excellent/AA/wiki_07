Megadeth

Megadeth is an American <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> band from <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. Guitarist <a href="Dave%20Mustaine">Dave Mustaine</a> and bassist <a href="David%20Ellefson">David Ellefson</a> formed the band in 1983 shortly after Mustaine's dismissal from <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a>. Along with Metallica, <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a>, and <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a>, Megadeth is one of the "Big Four" of American <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a>, responsible for its development and popularization. Their music features complex arrangements and fast <a href="Rhythm%20section">rhythm sections</a>, and lyrical themes of death, war, politics, and religion.

In 1985, Megadeth released its debut album, "<a href="Killing%20Is%20My%20Business...%20and%20Business%20Is%20Good%21">Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!</a>", on the independent record label <a href="Combat%20Records">Combat Records</a>, to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>. Their first major-label album, "<a href="Peace%20Sells...%20but%20Who%27s%20Buying%3F">Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?</a>", was released in 1986 and influenced the underground metal scene. Substance abuse and personal disputes brought Megadeth negative publicity during this period.

After the lineup stabilized, Megadeth released a number of <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">platinum-selling albums</a>, including "<a href="Rust%20in%20Peace">Rust in Peace</a>" (1990) and "<a href="Countdown%20to%20Extinction">Countdown to Extinction</a>" (1992). These albums, along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without bassist Ellefson, who had taken legal action against Mustaine. Ellefson settled out of court and rejoined in 2010. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, <a href="Gigantour">Gigantour</a>, several times since July 2005.

Megadeth has sold over 38 million records worldwide, earned platinum certification in the United States for five of its fifteen studio albums, and received twelve <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy nominations</a>. Megadeth won its first Grammy Award in <a href="59th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">2017</a> for the song "Dystopia" in the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Metal%20Performance">Best Metal Performance</a> category. The band's mascot, <a href="Vic%20Rattlehead">Vic Rattlehead</a>, regularly appears on album artwork and live shows. The group has drawn controversy for its music and lyrics, including album bans and canceled concerts; <a href="MTV">MTV</a> refused to play two of the band's music videos that the network considered to condone suicide.

On April 11, 1983, <a href="Dave%20Mustaine">Dave Mustaine</a> was expelled from <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a> just prior to the band recording their debut album "<a href="Kill%20%27Em%20All">Kill 'Em All</a>" due to substance abuse and personal conflicts with <a href="James%20Hetfield">James Hetfield</a> and <a href="Lars%20Ulrich">Lars Ulrich</a>. As Metallica's lead guitarist since 1981, Mustaine had composed some of the group's early songs and helped hone the band into a tight live unit. Afterward, Mustaine vowed revenge by forming a band that was faster and heavier than Metallica. On the bus trip back to Los Angeles, Mustaine found a pamphlet by California senator <a href="Alan%20Cranston">Alan Cranston</a> that read: "The arsenal of megadeath can't be rid no matter what the peace treaties come to." The term "Megadeath" stuck with Mustaine and he wrote a song with the spelling slightly changed to Megadeth, which, according to Mustaine, represented the annihilation of power.

After arriving back in Los Angeles, Mustaine began the search for new bandmates. He formed a band with his new neighbors <a href="David%20Ellefson">David Ellefson</a> and Greg Handevidt, who had moved from Minnesota and played bass and guitar respectively. While Handevidt would only last a few months, Mustaine and Ellefson formed a tight musical bond. Despite his enthusiasm, Mustaine had trouble finding other members to fill out the lineup. He and Ellefson examined about fifteen drummers, hoping to find one who understood <a href="Metre%20%28music%29">meter</a> changes in music. After briefly playing with Dijon Carruthers, they selected Lee Rausch. They also decided on Mustaine as lead vocalist after six months of searching.

In 1984, Megadeth recorded a three-song <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> tape featuring Mustaine, Ellefson, and Rausch. The demo tape, "Last Rites", was released on March 9, 1984. The demo featured early versions of "Last Rites/Loved to Death", "The Skull Beneath the Skin", and "Mechanix", all of which appeared on the band's debut album. A second guitarist proved elusive after several months of searching. In the meantime, <a href="Kerry%20King">Kerry King</a> of <a href="Slayer">Slayer</a> filled in on rhythm guitar for several shows in the San Francisco area in the spring of 1984. Afterwards, King went back to Slayer and Megadeth replaced Rausch with <a href="jazz%20fusion">jazz fusion</a> drummer <a href="Gar%20Samuelson">Gar Samuelson</a>. Samuelson had previously been in the jazz band the New Yorkers with guitarist <a href="Chris%20Poland">Chris Poland</a>. After seeing Samuelson perform with Megadeth as a trio, Poland went backstage and suggested an impromptu audition as lead guitarist for the band; he joined Megadeth in December 1984.

After considering several labels, Mustaine signed the band to <a href="Combat%20Records">Combat Records</a>, a New York-based <a href="Independent%20record%20label">Independent record label</a> that offered Megadeth the highest budget to record and tour. In 1985, Combat Records gave the band $8,000 to record and produce its debut album. After spending $4,000 of the budget on drugs, alcohol, and food, the band fired the original producer and finished the recording themselves. 

Despite its <a href="low%20fidelity">low-fidelity</a> sound, "<a href="Killing%20Is%20My%20Business...%20and%20Business%20Is%20Good%21">Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!</a>" was relatively successful in underground metal circles and attracted major-label interest. Music writer <a href="Joel%20McIver">Joel McIver</a> praised its "blistering technicality" and stated that the album "raised the bar for the whole thrash metal scene, with guitarists forced to perform even more accurately and powerfully". The front cover marked the debut of band mascot <a href="Vic%20Rattlehead">Vic Rattlehead</a>, who regularly appeared on subsequent album artwork.

"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!" features "Mechanix", a song Mustaine wrote during his time with Metallica. Though Mustaine told the band after his dismissal not to use the music he had written, Metallica recorded a different version of the song, "The Four Horsemen", with a slower tempo and a melodic middle section. The album also included a cover of <a href="Nancy%20Sinatra">Nancy Sinatra</a>'s "<a href="These%20Boots%20Are%20Made%20for%20Walkin%27">These Boots Are Made for Walkin'</a>," at a faster tempo and with altered lyrics. Megadeth's version generated controversy during the 1990s, when its writer, <a href="Lee%20Hazlewood">Lee Hazlewood</a>, called Mustaine's changes "vile and offensive". Under threat of legal action, the song was removed from pressings released from 1995 to 2001.

In mid-1985, on a bill with Canadian speed metal band <a href="Exciter%20%28band%29">Exciter</a>, Megadeth played its first North American tour: the Killing for a Living Tour. Touring guitarist <a href="Mike%20Albert">Mike Albert</a> replaced Poland, who was battling drug addiction. Poland rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, shortly before the group began recording its second album for Combat.

According to Mustaine, Megadeth was under pressure to deliver another successful album: "That sophomore offering is the 'be-all or end-all' of any band. You either go to the next level, or it's the beginning of the nadir." The songs were developed relatively quickly in an old warehouse south of Los Angeles before recording began. Mustaine composed the music, with the other members adding arrangement ideas. 

The album was produced on a $25,000 budget from Combat Records. Dissatisfied with its financial limitations, the band left Combat and signed with <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>. Capitol bought the rights to the album, and hired producer Paul Lani to remix the earlier recordings. Released in late 1986, "<a href="Peace%20Sells...%20but%20Who%27s%20Buying%3F">Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?</a>" has clearer production and more sophisticated songwriting. Mustaine wanted to write socially conscious lyrics, unlike mainstream heavy metal bands who sang about "hedonistic pleasures". The album was noted for its political commentary and helped Megadeth expand its fanbase. The <a href="Peace%20Sells">title track</a> was the album's lead single and was accompanied by a music video that received regular airplay on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>.

In February 1987, Megadeth was the opening act on <a href="Alice%20Cooper">Alice Cooper</a>'s Constrictor tour, and the following month began its first headlining world tour in the United Kingdom. The 72-week tour was supported by <a href="Overkill%20%28band%29">Overkill</a> and <a href="Necros">Necros</a>, and continued in the United States. During the tour, Mustaine and Ellefson considered firing Samuelson for his drug abuse. According to Mustaine, Samuelson had become too much to handle when intoxicated. Drummer <a href="Chuck%20Behler">Chuck Behler</a> traveled with Megadeth for the last dates of the tour as the other band members feared Samuelson would not be able to continue. Poland quarreled with Mustaine, and was accused of selling band equipment to buy heroin. As a result, Samuelson and Poland were asked to leave Megadeth in 1987, with Behler becoming the band's full-time drummer. 

Poland was initially replaced by Jay Reynolds of <a href="Malice%20%28American%20band%29">Malice</a>, but as the band began working on its next record, Reynolds was replaced by his guitar teacher, <a href="Jeff%20Young">Jeff Young</a>, when Megadeth was six weeks into the recording of its third album.

With a major-label budget, the Paul Lani-produced "<a href="So%20Far%2C%20So%20Good...%20So%20What%21">So Far, So Good... So What!</a>" took over five months to record. The production was plagued with problems, partially due to Mustaine's struggle with drug addiction. Mustaine later said: "The production of "So Far, So Good... So What!" was horrible, mostly due to substances and the priorities we had or didn't have at the time." Mustaine clashed with Lani, beginning with Lani's insistence that the drums be recorded separately from the cymbals, an unheard-of process for rock drummers. Mustaine and Lani became estranged during the mixing, and Lani was replaced by <a href="Michael%20Wagener">Michael Wagener</a>, who remixed the album.

"So Far, So Good... So What!" was released in January 1988 and was well received by fans and critics. The album featured a cover version of the <a href="Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</a>' "<a href="Anarchy%20in%20the%20U.K.">Anarchy in the U.K.</a>"; Mustaine changed the lyrics, later saying that he had simply heard them incorrectly. To support the album, Megadeth embarked on a world tour, opening for <a href="Dio%20%28band%29">Dio</a> in Europe and then joining <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>'s <a href="Seventh%20Tour%20of%20a%20Seventh%20Tour">Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour</a> in the United States.

In June 1988, Megadeth appeared in <a href="Penelope%20Spheeris">Penelope Spheeris</a>' documentary "". The documentary chronicled the Los Angeles heavy metal scene of the late 1980s, and Spheeris, who had directed Megadeth in the video for "Wake Up Dead", decided to include them to feature a more serious band in contrast to the <a href="glam%20metal">glam metal</a> groups. Mustaine remembered the film as a disappointment, as it aligned Megadeth with "a bunch of shit bands".

In August, the band appeared at the <a href="Monsters%20of%20Rock">Monsters of Rock</a> festival at <a href="Castle%20Donington">Castle Donington</a> in the United Kingdom, performing to an audience of more than 100,000. One show featured a guest appearance by Metallica drummer (and Mustaine's former bandmate) Lars Ulrich. The band was added to the Monsters of Rock European tour, but left after the first show due to Ellefson's drug problems, for which he was treated immediately.

Shortly after the Monsters of Rock appearance, Mustaine fired Behler and Young and canceled Megadeth's Australian tour. "On the road, things escalated from a small border skirmish into a full-on raging war," Mustaine later recalled. "I think a lot of us were inconsistent because of [drugs]." During the tour, Mustaine noticed problems developing with Behler and brought in drummer <a href="Nick%20Menza">Nick Menza</a> as Behler's <a href="Road%20crew">drum technician</a>. As with Samuelson, Menza was expected to take over if Behler could not continue the tour. Menza replaced Behler in 1989. Young's dismissal resulted from Mustaine's suspicions that he was having an affair with Mustaine's girlfriend, an allegation Young denied.

The band was unable to quickly find a suitable replacement for Young. At this time, Megadeth recorded a cover version of Alice Cooper's "<a href="No%20More%20Mr.%20Nice%20Guy%20%28song%29">No More Mr. Nice Guy</a>" which appeared on the soundtrack to the <a href="Wes%20Craven">Wes Craven</a> horror movie "<a href="Shocker%20%28film%29">Shocker</a>". The video was directed by <a href="Penelope%20Spheeris">Penelope Spheeris</a>, who recalled the filming as a "Herculean task" as Mustaine was unable to play guitar because of his drug addiction. During the March 1989 auditions for a new lead guitarist, Mustaine was arrested for <a href="driving%20under%20the%20influence">driving under the influence</a> and possession of narcotics after crashing into a parked vehicle occupied by an off-duty police officer. Mustaine entered court-ordered <a href="drug%20rehabilitation">drug rehabilitation</a> shortly afterwards, and became drug-free for the first time in ten years.

With Mustaine sober, Megadeth continued searching for a new lead guitarist. Among those auditioned were <a href="Lee%20Altus">Lee Altus</a> of <a href="Heathen%20%28band%29">Heathen</a> and <a href="Eric%20Meyer%20%28musician%29">Eric Meyer</a> of <a href="Dark%20Angel%20%28band%29">Dark Angel</a>. Meyer was invited to join the band after Poland's departure, but chose to remain with Dark Angel. <a href="Guns%20N%27%20Roses">Guns N' Roses</a> guitarist <a href="Slash%20%28musician%29">Slash</a> had been jamming with Mustaine and Ellefson, and although it seemed that he might join Megadeth, he remained with Guns N' Roses. <a href="Dimebag%20Darrell">Dimebag Darrell</a> of <a href="Pantera">Pantera</a> was offered the job, but refused to join without his brother, Pantera drummer <a href="Vinnie%20Paul">Vinnie Paul</a>. As Megadeth had already hired Menza, Darrell declined to join the band. The offer was also extended to <a href="Criss%20Oliva">Criss Oliva</a> who also declined as he did not want to leave <a href="Savatage">Savatage</a>. <a href="Jeff%20Loomis">Jeff Loomis</a>, who would later go on to form progressive metal titans <a href="Nevermore">Nevermore</a>, also auditioned though Mustaine deemed him too young to join as Loomis was only 16 at the time.
<a href="Marty%20Friedman">Marty Friedman</a> filled the guitarist position at the recommendation of Ron Laffitte, a member of Capitol management. Laffitte had heard "<a href="Dragon%27s%20Kiss">Dragon's Kiss</a>", a solo recording by Friedman when he was in <a href="Cacophony%20%28band%29">Cacophony</a>. Mustaine and Ellefson were satisfied with Friedman's style and thought that he understood Megadeth's music. With Friedman in the group, the band completed what fans consider the definitive Megadeth lineup. The revitalized band entered Rumbo Studios in March 1990 with co-producer <a href="Mike%20Clink">Mike Clink</a> to begin Megadeth's most critically acclaimed album, "<a href="Rust%20in%20Peace">Rust in Peace</a>". For the first time the band's members remained sober in the studio, alleviating many problems which plagued previous albums. Clink was the first producer to complete a Megadeth album without being fired. Its recording was documented in "<a href="Rusted%20Pieces">Rusted Pieces</a>", a home video released in 1991 with six music videos and an interview with the band.

Released in September 1990, "Rust in Peace" debuted at number 23 in the United States and number eight in the United Kingdom. Mustaine had developed a writing style with a rhythmically complex, progressive edge, and the songs featured longer guitar solos and frequent tempo changes. Described as a genre-defining work by "<a href="Decibel%20%28magazine%29">Decibel</a>", the album solidified Megadeth's reputation in the music industry. It features the singles "<a href="Holy%20Wars...%20The%20Punishment%20Due">Holy Wars... The Punishment Due</a>" and "<a href="Hangar%2018%20%28song%29">Hangar 18</a>", both of which were accompanied by music videos and became live staples. "Rust in Peace" received a Grammy nomination in 1991 for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Metal%20Performance">Best Metal Performance</a>, and was the group's third platinum album, certified in December 1994.

Early in 1990, Megadeth joined Slayer, <a href="Testament%20%28band%29">Testament</a>, and <a href="Suicidal%20Tendencies">Suicidal Tendencies</a> for the successful European <a href="Clash%20of%20the%20Titans%20%28tour%29">Clash of the Titans</a> tour, featuring several American thrash metal bands. An American leg began the following year featuring Megadeth, Slayer, and <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a>, with <a href="Alice%20in%20Chains">Alice in Chains</a> as a supporting act. The tour was considered a multi-headliner, as the three main bands alternated time slots. In addition to the Clash of the Titans tour, Megadeth played with <a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest</a> in North America late in 1990 and appeared at the second <a href="Rock%20in%20Rio">Rock in Rio</a> festival in January 1991.

The recording sessions for Megadeth's fifth studio album began in January 1992 at Enterprise Studios in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a>. <a href="Max%20Norman">Max Norman</a> was chosen to produce, as the band was pleased with his mixing of "Rust in Peace". Megadeth spent nearly four months in the studio with Norman, writing and recording what became the band's most commercially successful album, "<a href="Countdown%20to%20Extinction">Countdown to Extinction</a>". The album, whose title was suggested by Menza, features songwriting contributions from each band member. Ellefson explained that the band changed its approach to songwriting for this album, beginning to write more melodic songs.

Released in July 1992, "Countdown to Extinction" entered the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart at number two and was certified double platinum in the United States. The album's overseas success helped the band to develop a larger following outside the US. It received a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the <a href="35th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">1993 Grammy Awards</a>, and its title track won a <a href="Genesis%20Award">Genesis Award</a> from the <a href="The%20Humane%20Society%20of%20the%20United%20States">Humane Society</a> in 1993 for raising awareness for animal rights issues. Ellefson later said that he and Friedman were disappointed that Megadeth did not win the Grammy: "It was such a bizarre moment, because it was as if the amount of work it had taken to ramp up to that hopeful night was literally gone in a second."

A world tour in support of the album was launched in late 1992, with Pantera and <a href="White%20Zombie%20%28band%29">White Zombie</a> as supporting acts. The tour included a North American leg in early 1993, with <a href="Stone%20Temple%20Pilots">Stone Temple Pilots</a> as the opening act. One month into the leg, the remaining shows, including dates in Japan, were canceled when Mustaine returned to substance abuse, ending up in a hospital emergency room. After seven weeks in rehab, Mustaine emerged sober again and the band returned to the studio to record "<a href="Angry%20Again">Angry Again</a>". The song featured the soundtrack of the 1993 film "<a href="Last%20Action%20Hero">Last Action Hero</a>" and received a Grammy nomination in 1994.

During mid-1993, Megadeth performed at a number of shows with Metallica in Europe. The first was at <a href="National%20Bowl">Milton Keynes Bowl</a> in England, and included <a href="Diamond%20Head%20%28band%29">Diamond Head</a>. In July, Megadeth was added as the opening act for <a href="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>'s <a href="Get%20a%20Grip%20Tour">Get a Grip Tour</a>, but was removed from the bill after three shows. Aerosmith said that Megadeth was "dumped" because of Mustaine's erratic behavior, while Capitol Records said it was due to "artistic restrictions". After the canceled US tour, Megadeth returned to the studio to record "99 Ways to Die", which appeared on "<a href="The%20Beavis%20and%20Butt-head%20Experience">The Beavis and Butt-head Experience</a>", a compilation album released in November featuring songs interspersed with commentary by the main characters of the animated series "<a href="Beavis%20and%20Butt-head">Beavis and Butt-head</a>". The song was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the <a href="37th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">1995 Grammy Awards</a>. During these sessions, Megadeth recorded a cover version of <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>'s "<a href="Paranoid%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20song%29">Paranoid</a>", which appeared on the Black Sabbath tribute album "<a href="Nativity%20in%20Black">Nativity in Black</a>"; it was nominated for a Grammy the following year.

In early 1994, Megadeth reunited with producer Max Norman for the follow-up to "Countdown to Extinction". With three band members living in <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, initial work began at Phase Four Studios in <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a>. A few days into pre-production, problems with Phase Four's equipment forced the band to look for another studio. Mustaine insisted on recording in Arizona, but no suitable recording facility could be found. At Norman's request, the band built its own recording studio in Phoenix in a rented warehouse, later called "Fat Planet in Hangar 18". During the studio's construction, much of the pre-production songwriting and arrangements were done at Vintage Recorders in Phoenix. At Norman's suggestion, the tracks on "Youthanasia" had a slower tempo than previous albums, at about 120 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>. The band abandoned the progressive approach from its previous albums and focused on stronger vocal melodies and more accessible, radio-friendly arrangements. For the first time, Megadeth wrote and arranged the entire album in the studio, including basic tracks recorded live by the entire band. The album's recording was video recorded and released as "Evolver: The Making of Youthanasia" in 1995.

After eight months of studio work, "<a href="Youthanasia">Youthanasia</a>" was released in November 1994. It debuted at number four on the "Billboard" 200 and charted in several European countries. The album was certified gold in Canada the day it was released, and was certified platinum in the US two months later. Megadeth hired fashion photographer <a href="Richard%20Avedon">Richard Avedon</a> to enhance the band's image. Avedon had the band members exchange their jeans and T-shirts for a more conscious appearance. To promote "Youthanasia", the band played a Halloween show in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> called "Night of the Living Megadeth", which was broadcast live on MTV. In November, the band performed twice on the "<a href="Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</a>", playing "<a href="Train%20of%20Consequences">Train of Consequences</a>" on the first appearance and "<a href="%C3%80%20Tout%20le%20Monde">À Tout le Monde</a>" on the second.

An eleven-month tour began in South America in November 1994. In 1995, Megadeth played in Europe and North America with several opening acts, including <a href="Corrosion%20of%20Conformity">Corrosion of Conformity</a>, <a href="Korn">Korn</a> and <a href="Fear%20Factory">Fear Factory</a>. The tour culminated with an appearance at the Monsters of Rock festival in Brazil, co-headlining with Alice Cooper and <a href="Ozzy%20Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a>. In January 1995, Megadeth appeared on the soundtrack of the horror movie "<a href="Demon%20Knight">Demon Knight</a>" with the song "Diadems". In July, Megadeth released "<a href="Hidden%20Treasures%20%28EP%29">Hidden Treasures</a>", an <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> featuring songs which originally appeared on movie soundtracks and tribute albums.

After the extensive world tour in support of "Youthanasia", Megadeth took time off late in 1995. Mustaine began work on <a href="MD.45">MD.45</a>, a side project with vocalist <a href="Lee%20Ving">Lee Ving</a> of <a href="Fear%20%28band%29">Fear</a>. The duo hired drummer <a href="Jimmy%20DeGrasso">Jimmy DeGrasso</a>, who had played with Alice Cooper on the South American Monsters of Rock tour earlier that year. Marty Friedman built a studio in his new home in Phoenix and completed his fourth solo album, released in April 1996. In September 1996, Megadeth went to London to work on songs for the next album. The songwriting was closely supervised by new manager Bud Prager, who contributed musical ideas and lyrics; many lyrics and song titles were changed at his request. Regarding Prager's influence, Mustaine later wrote: "I figured maybe this guy [Prager] could help me get that intangible number one record I so badly wanted." The album, recorded in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>, was Megadeth's first collaboration with <a href="country%20pop">country pop</a> producer <a href="Dann%20Huff">Dann Huff</a>, who had met Mustaine in 1990.

"<a href="Cryptic%20Writings">Cryptic Writings</a>" was released in June 1997. The album peaked at number ten on the "Billboard" 200, and was eventually certified gold in the United States. Its lead single, "<a href="Trust%20%28Megadeth%20song%29">Trust</a>", became Megadeth's highest charting song on the <a href="Mainstream%20Rock%20%28chart%29">Mainstream Rock Tracks</a> at number five, and was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the <a href="40th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">1998 Grammy Awards</a>. Although all four singles from the album entered the top 20 on "Billboard"s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, press response to the album was mixed. The album featured a diverse set of songs which the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" described as a "rousing balance" between older material and experimental songs. Asked about the album's eclecticism, Mustaine said that "Cryptic Writings" was divided into thirds. One part was based around faster, more aggressive material, another was "radio-orientated music like "Youthanasia"", and the final third was more melodic.

After more than a year since the band's last concert, Megadeth returned as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the <a href="Misfits%20%28band%29">Misfits</a> and touring in the United States with <a href="Life%20of%20Agony">Life of Agony</a> and <a href="Coal%20Chamber">Coal Chamber</a>. In July, the band participated in <a href="Ozzfest">Ozzfest</a> '98 but, halfway through the tour, Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on his knee and left to undergo surgery. Jimmy DeGrasso, who had collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired to replace Menza for the remainder of the tour. Though initially meant to be a temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the tour. Mustaine later said that he dismissed Menza from the band because he believed the drummer had lied about having cancer.

Following the band's mainstream radio success with "Cryptic Writings", Megadeth again worked with Dann Huff on its eighth studio album. The band began writing in January 1999, supervised by manager Bud Prager, who was credited with co-writing five of the album's twelve songs. With high expectations following the chart success of "Trust", Prager convinced Mustaine to grant Huff even more control over the album's recording, a decision Mustaine later regretted.

"<a href="Risk%20%28Megadeth%20album%29">Risk</a>", released in August 1999, was a critical and commercial failure and led to backlash from many longtime fans. Although its two predecessors incorporated rock elements alongside a more traditional heavy metal sound, "Risk" was virtually devoid of metal. About the band's musical direction, Dave Mustaine said: "We hit the nadir of our career with "Risk", and I vowed after that we were going to get back to our roots. It took a little bit of time to do that." Despite this, "Risk" was certified gold in the United States. The album's lead single, "<a href="Crush%20%27Em">Crush 'Em</a>", appeared on the soundtrack for "" and was used as an entrance theme for <a href="NHL">NHL</a> hockey games and professional wrestling events.

On July 14, 1999, former drummer Gar Samuelson died of <a href="liver%20failure">liver failure</a> at age 41 in <a href="Orange%20City%2C%20Florida">Orange City, Florida</a>. Three days later, during Megadeth's performance at <a href="Woodstock%201999">Woodstock 1999</a>, Mustaine dedicated "Peace Sells" to Samuelson's memory. That month, Megadeth also recorded a cover version of the Black Sabbath's "<a href="Never%20Say%20Die%20%28Black%20Sabbath%20song%29">Never Say Die</a>" for the second Nativity in Black tribute album. The band began a world tour in support of "Risk" in September, playing with Iron Maiden during the European leg. Three months into the tour, Friedman announced his resignation from Megadeth, citing musical differences. Mustaine later said: "I told [Marty] after "Risk" that we had to go back to our roots and play metal, and he quit." In January 2000, guitarist <a href="Al%20Pitrelli">Al Pitrelli</a>, formerly of <a href="Savatage">Savatage</a> and the <a href="Trans-Siberian%20Orchestra">Trans-Siberian Orchestra</a>, became Friedman's replacement.

In April, Megadeth returned to the studio to work on its ninth studio album. A month into production, the band received an offer to join the Maximum Rock tour with Anthrax and <a href="M%C3%B6tley%20Cr%C3%BCe">Mötley Crüe</a>. Megadeth put the recording on hold and toured North America during the second quarter of 2000. Early in the tour, Anthrax was removed from the bill, allowing Megadeth to play an extended co-headlining set. The tour, however, had poor ticket sales.

After 15 years with Capitol Records, Megadeth left the label in July 2000. According to Mustaine, the departure was due to ongoing tensions with Capitol management. Capitol returned the band's newest recordings and released a greatest hits album, "", with two new tracks: "Kill the King" and "Dread and the Fugitive Mind". In November, Megadeth signed with <a href="Sanctuary%20Records">Sanctuary Records</a>. The band returned to the studio in October to finish its next album, "<a href="The%20World%20Needs%20a%20Hero">The World Needs a Hero</a>", which was near completion when Megadeth joined the Maximum Rock tour six months earlier. Following the negative response to "Risk", Mustaine fired Bud Prager and produced the album himself. The songs were written by Mustaine alone, except for "Promises", which had contributions from Pitrelli. Two days before the release of "The World Needs a Hero", Megadeth appeared in an episode of <a href="VH1">VH1</a>'s "<a href="Behind%20the%20Music">Behind the Music</a>" showcasing Mustaine, Ellefson, several past members, and Mustaine's old Metallica bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.

"The World Needs a Hero" was released in May 2001, and debuted at number sixteen on the "Billboard" 200. It was banned in Malaysia when the national government determined that the album's artwork was "unsuitable for the nation's youth". Consequently, the band canceled its August 2 concert in <a href="Kuala%20Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>. The album marked Megadeth's return to a more aggressive sound after the stylistic variations of its previous two albums, but critics felt it fell short of expectations. Mustaine compared the album to a huge ship at sea, turning and trying to right itself to get back on course. Its lead single, "Moto Psycho", reached number 22 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.

A European tour with <a href="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> in support of "The World Needs a Hero" began in mid-2001, followed by an American tour with <a href="Iced%20Earth">Iced Earth</a> and <a href="Endo%20%28band%29">Endo</a> in September. Mustaine allowed fans to choose the setlist in each American city. However, the tour was cut short following the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>; all dates were canceled, including a DVD shoot in Argentina. The band instead played two shows in Arizona on November 16 and 17, which were filmed and released as Megadeth's first live release, "<a href="Rude%20Awakening%20%28Megadeth%20album%29">Rude Awakening</a>". That year, "Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!" was remixed and remastered; the reissue featured modified artwork and several bonus tracks.

In January 2002, Mustaine was hospitalized for the removal of a <a href="kidney%20stone">kidney stone</a> and was administered pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair, caused compression of the <a href="radial%20nerve">radial nerve</a>. He was diagnosed with <a href="radial%20neuropathy">radial neuropathy</a>, which left him unable to grasp or make a fist with his left hand.

On April 3, Mustaine announced in a press release that he was disbanding Megadeth as his arm injury rendered him unable to play guitar. For the next four months, he had physical therapy five days a week, and slowly began to "re-teach" his left hand. To fulfill contract obligations to Sanctuary, Megadeth released the compilation album "<a href="Still%20Alive...%20and%20Well%3F">Still Alive... and Well?</a>". The first half of the album contains live tracks recorded at the Web Theatre in Phoenix, and the second half has studio recordings from "The World Needs a Hero".

Following nearly a year of recovery, including physical and <a href="electroshock%20therapy">electroshock therapy</a>, Mustaine began work on what was to have been his first solo album. The new material was recorded with session musicians <a href="Vinnie%20Colaiuta">Vinnie Colaiuta</a> and <a href="Jimmie%20Lee%20Sloas">Jimmie Lee Sloas</a> in October 2003. The project was put on hold when Mustaine agreed to remix and remaster Megadeth's eight-album back catalog on Capitol Records, re-recording portions that were missing or altered without his knowledge in the original mixing.

In May 2004, Mustaine returned to his solo project. Contractual obligations to the band's European label, <a href="EMI">EMI</a>, resulted in the recording's release as a Megadeth album. Mustaine reformed the band and contacted the fan-favorite "Rust in Peace" lineup to re-record backing tracks. While drummer Nick Menza agreed to return, both Marty Friedman and David Ellefson were unable to come to an agreement with Mustaine. Menza was sent home shortly after rehearsals began, a few days before the start of a tour supporting Megadeth's upcoming album. Mustaine said Menza was insufficiently prepared for the physical demands of a US tour, and "it just didn't work out". This was the first album without Ellefson. Chris Poland, who played lead guitar on Megadeth's first two albums, was hired to contribute guitar solos to the new album, working with Mustaine for the first time since the 1980s. Poland opted to serve only as a session musician, wanting to remain focused on his jazz fusion project <a href="OHM%20%28band%29">OHM</a>.

"<a href="The%20System%20Has%20Failed">The System Has Failed</a>" was released in September 2004. Critics heralded it as a return to form; "<a href="Revolver%20%28magazine%29">Revolver</a>" gave the album a favorable review, calling it "Megadeth's most vengeful, poignant and musically complex offering since 1992's "Countdown to Extinction"". The album marked a shift toward the band's earlier sound; journalist Amy Sciarretto of "<a href="CMJ%20New%20Music%20Report">CMJ New Music Report</a>" wrote that the album contained "<a href="Neo-Thrash">neo-thrash</a> riffing with biting, politically charged lyrics". "The System Has Failed" debuted at number eighteen on the "Billboard" 200 and was led by "Die Dead Enough", which reached number 21 on the US <a href="Mainstream%20Rock%20%28chart%29">Mainstream Rock chart</a>. Mustaine announced that the album would be the band's last and would be followed by a farewell tour, after which he would focus on a solo career.

Megadeth began the Blackmail the Universe world tour in October, enlisting touring bassist <a href="James%20MacDonough">James MacDonough</a> of Iced Earth and guitarist <a href="Glen%20Drover">Glen Drover</a> of <a href="Eidolon%20%28band%29">Eidolon</a> and <a href="King%20Diamond">King Diamond</a>. Five days before the first show, Menza was replaced by <a href="Shawn%20Drover">Shawn Drover</a>, who remained with the band as a regular member. The band toured the US with <a href="Exodus%20%28American%20band%29">Exodus</a> and Europe with Diamond Head and <a href="Dungeon%20%28band%29">Dungeon</a>. In June 2005, Capitol released a greatest-hits compilation, "", featuring remixed and remastered versions of songs chosen by fans from Megadeth's Capitol albums.

In mid-2005, Mustaine organized an annual thrash metal festival tour, <a href="Gigantour">Gigantour</a>. Megadeth headlined the inaugural tour with acts such as <a href="Dream%20Theater">Dream Theater</a>, <a href="Nevermore">Nevermore</a>, Anthrax, and Fear Factory. Performances at the <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> and <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> shows were filmed and recorded for a live DVD-and-CD set released in the second quarter of 2006. On October 9, following the successes of "The System Has Failed" and the Blackmail the Universe world tour, Mustaine announced to a sold-out crowd at the <a href="Pepsi%20Music%20Festival">Pepsi Music Rock Festival</a> in Argentina that Megadeth would continue to record and tour. The concert, held at <a href="Estadio%20Obras%20Sanitarias">Obras Sanitarias</a> stadium in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> in front of 25,000 fans, was filmed and released on DVD as "" in 2007.

In February 2006, bassist James MacDonough left the band over "personal differences". He was replaced by <a href="James%20LoMenzo">James LoMenzo</a>, who had worked with <a href="David%20Lee%20Roth">David Lee Roth</a>, <a href="White%20Lion">White Lion</a>, and <a href="Black%20Label%20Society">Black Label Society</a>. The new Megadeth lineup made its live debut headlining the <a href="Dubai%20Desert%20Rock%20Festival">Dubai Desert Rock Festival</a> in the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> with Testament. In March, Capitol released a two-disc DVD, "<a href="Arsenal%20of%20Megadeth">Arsenal of Megadeth</a>", which included archive footage, interviews, live shows, and many of the band's music videos. Due to licensing issues, soundtrack and non-Capitol videos were not included. The second Gigantour began during the third quarter of 2006; Megadeth again headlined, this time with <a href="Lamb%20of%20God%20%28band%29">Lamb of God</a>, <a href="Opeth">Opeth</a>, <a href="Arch%20Enemy%20%28band%29">Arch Enemy</a> and Overkill. The 2006 tour included three dates in Australia, supported by <a href="Soulfly">Soulfly</a>, <a href="Arch%20Enemy">Arch Enemy</a>, and <a href="Caliban%20%28band%29">Caliban</a>.

In May 2006, Megadeth announced that its eleventh studio album, "<a href="United%20Abominations">United Abominations</a>", was near completion. Originally scheduled for release in October, Mustaine said that the band was "putting the finishing touches on it" and postponed its release to May of the following year. He commented on the release: "Metal needs a really good old-school record again. I believe I have delivered." "United Abominations" was the band's first album to feature Glen Drover, Shawn Drover, and James Lomenzo. It also has a newer version of "À Tout le Monde" entitled "<a href="%C3%80%20Tout%20le%20Monde%232007%20version">À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)</a>". The 2007 version is a duet with <a href="Cristina%20Scabbia">Cristina Scabbia</a> of <a href="Lacuna%20Coil">Lacuna Coil</a>; it was recorded at a slightly faster tempo than the original and contains an extended solo.

Released in May 2007, "United Abominations" debuted at number eight on the "Billboard" 200, selling 54,000 copies in the first week. In March, Megadeth began a North American tour opening for the newly reformed <a href="Heaven%20%26amp%3B%20Hell%20%28band%29">Heaven & Hell</a>. The band played with <a href="Down%20%28band%29">Down</a> for Canadian shows and with <a href="Machine%20Head%20%28band%29">Machine Head</a> for the US dates. A European summer festival tour followed. Late in the year, Megadeth returned to the United States to headline its Tour of Duty. In November, the band brought Gigantour to Australia with a lineup including <a href="Static-X">Static-X</a>, <a href="DevilDriver">DevilDriver</a> and Lacuna Coil.

In January 2008, Glen Drover quit Megadeth, stating that he was tired of the frequent touring and wanted to spend more time with his family. He also cited personal issues with other band members. Drover was replaced by <a href="Chris%20Broderick">Chris Broderick</a>, formerly of <a href="Nevermore">Nevermore</a> and <a href="Jag%20Panzer">Jag Panzer</a>. Broderick was initially asked by Mustaine's management company at the end of 2007 if he would be interested in auditioning for Megadeth. After an informal meeting at Mustaine's house, Broderick was introduced as the band's new guitarist. Mustaine complimented Broderick's playing skills and called him "the best guitarist Megadeth has ever had". Broderick's former Nevermore bandmate, <a href="Van%20Williams%20%28musician%29">Van Williams</a>, congratulated Megadeth on "getting one hell of a good player, more importantly they're getting a great guy to hang out with and a true friend".

The new lineup made its live debut at the <a href="Helsinki%20Ice%20Hall">Helsinki Ice Hall</a> on February 4. The 2008 Gigantour, with 29 North American dates, began shortly afterwards. Mustaine wanted a shorter lineup, allowing each band a chance to perform well. The third tour featured <a href="In%20Flames">In Flames</a>, <a href="Children%20of%20Bodom">Children of Bodom</a>, <a href="Job%20for%20a%20Cowboy">Job for a Cowboy</a> and <a href="High%20on%20Fire">High on Fire</a>. Megadeth continued the Tour of Duty in South America and Mexico in May and June. A compilation album, "", was released in September 2008.

In February 2009, Megadeth and Testament were scheduled on the European "Priest Feast" tour, with Judas Priest as headliners. At this time, Metallica, who had been inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, invited Mustaine to attend the ceremony. Mustaine was informed that he would not be inducted to the Hall of Fame because such honors were granted only to those members who received recording credit on a Metallica album. Mustaine congratulated the group respectfully, and honored his commitment to the European tour with Judas Priest. In April, Megadeth and Slayer co-headlined the Canadian Carnage. This was the first time they had performed together in more than 15 years. Machine Head and <a href="Suicide%20Silence">Suicide Silence</a> opened for the four shows that occurred later in June.

In May, Megadeth finished recording its twelfth album, "<a href="Endgame%20%28Megadeth%20album%29">Endgame</a>". The release date for "Endgame" was announced on the Megadeth official website, and "<a href="Metal%20Hammer">Metal Hammer</a>" was the first to review the album track-by-track. Megadeth began its Endgame tour in October, and finished it in December. The tour featured a number of supporting acts, including Machine Head, Suicide Silence, and <a href="Warbringer">Warbringer</a>. In January 2010, Megadeth was set to embark on the American Carnage tour with Slayer and Testament, but the tour was postponed due to <a href="Tom%20Araya">Tom Araya</a>'s back surgery. Several weeks later, Megadeth's "<a href="Head%20Crusher">Head Crusher</a>" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the <a href="52nd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">2010 Grammy Awards</a>, the band's eighth Grammy nomination in 19 years.

In March, Megadeth embarked on the Rust in Peace 20th Anniversary Tour, which took place in North America and had support from Testament and Exodus. During the tour, Megadeth played "Rust in Peace" in its entirety. Prior to the start of the tour, original bassist Ellefson rejoined Megadeth after eight years. In an interview for "<a href="Classic%20Rock%20%28magazine%29">Classic Rock</a>", he stated that Shawn Drover contacted him, informing him that bassist LoMenzo was leaving the band, saying "if ever there was a time for you and Dave [Mustaine] to talk, now is it".

Megadeth, along with Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, collectively known as the "big four" of thrash metal, agreed to perform on the same bill during mid-2010. These performances were part of the <a href="Sonisphere%20Festival">Sonisphere Festival</a> and were held in a number of European countries. One such performance in <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, Bulgaria, was filmed and released as a video album entitled "". These shows continued the following year in the United States. The first took place in <a href="Indio%2C%20California">Indio, California</a>, and was the only scheduled show in the United States at the time, although a second American production was held at <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a> in New York City shortly afterwards.

In July 2010, after the European "big four" shows, Megadeth and Slayer commenced the first leg of the <a href="American%20Carnage%20Tour">American Carnage Tour</a>, where Megadeth played "Rust in Peace" in its entirety, while Slayer performed its album "<a href="Seasons%20in%20the%20Abyss">Seasons in the Abyss</a>", both of which were released in 1990. From these shows onward, Vic Rattlehead started making sustained onstage appearances, to improve the visual facet of Megadeth's live performances. Shortly afterward, the two bands united with Anthrax for the <a href="J%C3%A4germeister%20Music%20Tour">Jägermeister Music Tour</a> in late 2010. During the final show of the tour, Kerry King joined Megadeth on stage at the <a href="Gibson%20Amphitheatre">Gibson Amphitheatre</a> in Hollywood to perform Megadeth's "Rattlehead". It was the first time that King had performed onstage with Megadeth as the latter's early shows in 1984. Megadeth and Slayer again shared the stage for the <a href="European%20Carnage%20Tour">European Carnage Tour</a> in March and April 2011. Megadeth also headlined the fourth annual <a href="Rockstar%20Mayhem%20Festival">Rockstar Mayhem Festival</a> in July and August the same year.

In September, the band released the DVD album "<a href="Rust%20in%20Peace%20Live">Rust in Peace Live</a>", recorded at the <a href="Hollywood%20Palladium">Hollywood Palladium</a> in Los Angeles. Later that month, Megadeth released "<a href="Sudden%20Death%20%28song%29">Sudden Death</a>" for the video game "". The song was commissioned by the publishers of the <a href="Guitar%20Hero">Guitar Hero</a> franchise, who wanted the track to feature dark lyrics and multiple guitar solos. It was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the <a href="53rd%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">2011 Grammy ceremony</a>.

Megadeth returned to its own Vic's Garage studio to record its thirteenth album, to be produced by <a href="Johnny%20K">Johnny K</a>, because Andy Sneap, the producer of Megadeth's previous two albums, was unavailable. The album was titled "<a href="Thirteen%20%28Megadeth%20album%29">Thirteen</a>" and featured previously released tracks such as "Sudden Death" and "Never Dead". The album was released in November 2011, and charted at number eleven on the "Billboard" 200; its lead single "<a href="Public%20Enemy%20No.%201%20%28Megadeth%20song%29">Public Enemy No. 1</a>" received a Grammy nomination for <a href="Best%20Hard%20Rock/Metal%20Performance">Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance</a>, but did not win. Shortly after the album was released, Dave Mustaine stated that, after a four-year hiatus, there would be a new Gigantour tour in early 2012. The lineup consisted of <a href="Mot%C3%B6rhead">Motörhead</a>, <a href="Volbeat">Volbeat</a>, and Lacuna Coil alongside Megadeth. After the conclusion of Gigantour, <a href="Rob%20Zombie">Rob Zombie</a> and Megadeth announced a nine-date co-headlining US tour scheduled for May 2012.

In September 2012, it was announced that Megadeth would re-release "Countdown to Extinction" in honor of the album's 20th anniversary. To mark the occasion, Megadeth launched a tour in which the band performed the album live in its entirety. One performance, filmed at the <a href="Pomona%20Fox%20Theater">Pomona Fox Theater</a>, was released as a live album, "," the following year. Another track from "Thirteen", "Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)", was nominated for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the <a href="55th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">2013 Grammy Awards</a>, but lost to <a href="Halestorm">Halestorm</a>'s "<a href="Love%20Bites%20%28So%20Do%20I%29">Love Bites (So Do I)</a>".

In August, Megadeth announced the recording of its fourteenth album with producer Johnny K. At the start of 2013, Megadeth left <a href="Roadrunner%20Records">Roadrunner Records</a> for Mustaine's newly founded label, Tradecraft, distributed through <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Group</a>. The album, "<a href="Super%20Collider%20%28album%29">Super Collider</a>", was released in June and debuted at number six on the "Billboard" 200, the band's highest chart position since 1994's "Youthanasia". Critical reaction to the album, however, was largely negative. Shortly after the release of "Super Collider", Mustaine stated that he had already started thinking about a fifteenth Megadeth album. He said this had been spurred by the death of Slayer guitarist <a href="Jeff%20Hanneman">Jeff Hanneman</a>, which gave him a sense of mortality. Mustaine elaborated: "You know, time is short. Nobody knows how long they're gonna live. You see what happened with Jeff Hanneman, so I wanna write as much as I can while I can."

The 2013 edition of Gigantour featured <a href="Black%20Label%20Society">Black Label Society</a>, <a href="Hellyeah">Hellyeah</a>, <a href="Device%20%28metal%20band%29">Device</a>, and <a href="Newsted">Newsted</a> as opening bands. At the final show, <a href="Jason%20Newsted">Jason Newsted</a>, Metallica's former bassist, joined Megadeth onstage to perform "Phantom Lord", a song Mustaine had co-written during his stint with Metallica. Early in 2014, Megadeth was slated to play the <a href="Soundwave%20%28Australian%20music%20festival%29">Soundwave</a> festival in Australia, but pulled out over a disagreement with tour promoter A. J. Maddah concerning the band's sideshows with Newsted. <a href="Icon%20%28Megadeth%20album%29">Icon</a>, an eleven-song compilation of Megadeth's Capitol-era material, was released as part of Universal Music's <a href="Icon%20%28album%20series%29">Icon series</a> in February.

The band encountered several setbacks through the second half of 2014. The August concert in <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a> was canceled due to an <a href="2014%20Israel%E2%80%93Gaza%20conflict">armed conflict between Israel and Gaza</a>. Megadeth was scheduled to appear on <a href="Mot%C3%B6rhead">Motörhead</a>'s Motörboat cruise in late September, but withdrew because of Mustaine's complications following his cervical spine surgery. In late November, Drover quit the band after ten years, wanting to pursue his own musical interests. This was quickly followed by the departure of Broderick, due to artistic and musical differences. Ellefson denied rumors that Megadeth would disband, and said he and Mustaine would continue working on new music. Mustaine said that one of the reasons for Broderick's and Drover's departure was the frustration caused by Megadeth's fan base demanding a reunion with Friedman and Menza. Tragically, former Megadeth drummer Nick Menza died from a heart attack on May 21, 2016 while performing with OHM at a <a href="The%20Baked%20Potato">jazz club</a> in Los Angeles. <a href="Lamb%20of%20God%20%28band%29">Lamb of God</a> drummer <a href="Chris%20Adler">Chris Adler</a> and guitarist <a href="Kiko%20Loureiro">Kiko Loureiro</a> of <a href="Angra%20%28band%29">Angra</a> were brought in to perform on Megadeth's fifteenth studio album.

In October 2015, Megadeth streamed "Fatal Illusion" off the album "<a href="Dystopia%20%28Megadeth%20album%29">Dystopia</a>", which was released in January 2016. In support of "Dystopia", Megadeth embarked on a North American tour in February and March with <a href="Suicidal%20Tendencies">Suicidal Tendencies</a>, <a href="Children%20of%20Bodom">Children of Bodom</a> and <a href="Havok%20%28band%29">Havok</a> (though Havok was soon removed from the tour by Megadeth's management following a dispute over a contract). Mustaine announced that Adler, who was performing with both Lamb of God and Megadeth, was no longer in the band due to scheduling conflicts between the two bands. He was replaced by <a href="Dirk%20Verbeuren">Dirk Verbeuren</a> from <a href="Soilwork">Soilwork</a>, on Adler's recommendation. A second US tour took place in September and October, with support from <a href="Amon%20Amarth">Amon Amarth</a>, <a href="Suicidal%20Tendencies">Suicidal Tendencies</a>, <a href="Metal%20Church">Metal Church</a>, and <a href="Butcher%20Babies">Butcher Babies</a>.

Asked about any further Big Four gigs, Mustaine called for "the powers-that-be" to help put together a new Big Four tour in 2017 as all the respective bands were promoting new albums. "Dystopia"'s title track won the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Metal%20Performance">Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance</a> at the <a href="2017%20Grammy%20Awards">2017 Grammy Awards</a>, the band's first win after 12 nominations. Mustaine, Loureiro, Ellefson, and Verbeuren attended the ceremony; however, album drummer and award recipient Chris Adler did not. While accepting the award, the house band played Mustaine's former band Metallica's "<a href="Master%20of%20Puppets%20%28song%29">Master of Puppets</a>" causing some controversy among fans.

The band joined with <a href="Scorpions%20%28band%29">Scorpions</a> for a co-headlining tour in the fall of 2017.

In June 2017 interview with No Brown M&Ms, Mustaine said that Megadeth would enter the studio at the end of the year to begin working on their sixteenth studio album. He explained, "We plan on going back in the studio, we're probably gonna go back in and start throwing some ideas around at the end of the year. We’re thinking about November or December." A month later, Mustaine stated on Twitter that he has begun "collecting ideas" for the new Megadeth album, but stated that they will "probably" enter the studio in mid-2018 to begin recording it for a 2019 release.

On April 6, 2018, the band announced a re-issue of "Killing Is My Business... And Business is Good!" containing remastered versions of all songs and a re-cut version of "<a href="These%20Boots%20Are%20Made%20for%20Walkin%27">These Boots</a>" being lyrically adjusted to <a href="Lee%20Hazlewood">Hazlewood</a>'s version, bonus discs also included rare live performances of songs off the album during Alice Cooper's Live in the Flesh Tour. The re-issued album, "Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill", was released on June 8, 2018.

On September 25, 2018, Megadeth announced that they had launched its first-ever cruise called Megacruise, which was set to take place in the Pacific Ocean in 2019. Two weeks later, it was announced that Megacruise is due to sail on October 13, 2019 from <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and hit ports of <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> and <a href="Ensenada%2C%20Baja%20California">Ensenada</a> before returning on October 18, and will include performances by heavy metal acts such as <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a>, <a href="Testament%20%28band%29">Testament</a>, <a href="Overkill%20%28band%29">Overkill</a>, <a href="Corrosion%20of%20Conformity">Corrosion of Conformity</a>, <a href="Armored%20Saint">Armored Saint</a>, <a href="Metal%20Church">Metal Church</a>, <a href="DragonForce">DragonForce</a>, <a href="Doro%20%28musician%29">Doro</a> and <a href="John%205%20%28guitarist%29">John 5</a>.

On November 6, 2018, <a href="Dave%20Mustaine">Dave Mustaine</a> shared a video on his <a href="Instagram">Instagram</a> teasing a track from the band’s sixteenth album. The album is set to release in 2019.

Mustaine has made numerous inflammatory statements in the press, usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud stemmed from his ejection from the band, how it was conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits. Mustaine expressed his anger in the movie "<a href="Some%20Kind%20of%20Monster%20%28film%29">Some Kind of Monster</a>", in a scene he later disapproved of as he felt he was mischaracterized, and that it did not represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting.

During a live performance of "Anarchy in the U.K." at a 1988 show in <a href="Antrim%20%28borough%29">Antrim</a>, <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, Mustaine drunkenly and confusedly dedicated the song to "the cause" of "giving Ireland back to the Irish!" Before the final song, Mustaine said, "This one's for the cause! Give Ireland back to the Irish!" This elicited a riot and fighting between Catholics and Protestants among the audience. The band had to travel in a bulletproof bus back to <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. Mustaine later said that he had been misled by T-shirt bootleggers about the meaning of the expression "the cause". This incident served as inspiration for the song "Holy Wars... The Punishment Due".

Controversial and misinterpreted lyrics have caused complications for the band. In 1988, <a href="MTV">MTV</a> deemed that the song "In My Darkest Hour" encouraged suicide and banned the video. The station banned the video for "A Tout le Monde" for the same reason, though Mustaine said the song was written from the perspective of a dying man saying his last words to his loved ones. According to him, MTV considered the videos for "<a href="Skin%20o%27%20My%20Teeth">Skin o' My Teeth</a>" and "<a href="Symphony%20of%20Destruction">Symphony of Destruction</a>" a "little bit too harsh" and refused to play them.

During a world tour in 2001, the Malaysian government canceled the band's show in the nation's capital because the authorities had a negative perception of the group's image and music. The government pointed the band's mascot Vic Rattlehead as inappropriate and told the members that they would be arrested if they performed. Dave Mustaine responded: "I recognize what the Malaysian government is trying to do, and it is admirable of them trying to protect the young people in the country. But it just shows the degree of ignorance and apathy that the government has toward the problem."

In 2003, after recovering from an arm injury that threatened to end his career, Mustaine became a <a href="born%20again">born-again</a> Christian. Minor controversy was sparked by Mustaine's announcement that Megadeth would not play certain songs live due to his conversion. In May 2005, Mustaine allegedly threatened to cancel shows in Greece and Israel with <a href="extreme%20metal">extreme metal</a> bands <a href="Rotting%20Christ">Rotting Christ</a> and <a href="Dissection%20%28band%29">Dissection</a> due to the bands' anti-Christian beliefs. This caused the two bands to cancel appearances.

In July 2004, Ellefson sued Mustaine for $18.5 million in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a>. Ellefson alleged that Mustaine short-changed him on profits including tour merchandise and publishing royalties. The suit was dismissed in 2005, and Mustaine filed a countersuit alleging that Ellefson had used the band's name in an advertisement for musical equipment; the suit was settled out of court.

Traditional <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> bands such as <a href="UFO%20%28band%29">UFO</a>, <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, <a href="Budgie%20%28band%29">Budgie</a>, <a href="new%20wave%20of%20British%20heavy%20metal">new wave of British heavy metal</a> (NWOBHM) bands such as <a href="Mot%C3%B6rhead">Motörhead</a>, <a href="Iron%20Maiden">Iron Maiden</a>, and <a href="Diamond%20Head%20%28band%29">Diamond Head</a>, and <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> bands such as the Sex Pistols and <a href="Ramones">Ramones</a> had a significant influence on Megadeth's sound. <a href="Hard%20rock">Hard rock</a> bands such as AC/DC and <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> were also influential on the group's guitar style. Although the music has roots in punk, university professor Jason Bivins wrote that Megadeth followed the basic blueprint of Motörhead and Iron Maiden. He described the style as a mix of "the instrumental virtuosity of the NWOBHM with the speed and aggression of <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a>", while also drawing lyrical inspiration from the horror-obsessed punk band <a href="Misfits%20%28band%29">Misfits</a>. Mustaine has also listed albums by <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> as recordings that influenced him.

Mustaine is the band's primary songwriter. He develops songs starting with a particular riff that, with modifications, becomes the central part of the song. He has said that song fragments are composed separately, and then the band makes a compact structure from them. Drummer Shawn Drover stated that Mustaine had saved many riffs over the years and that some recent material is based on those demo recordings. Ellefson stated that the band constantly creates new material, and that making a recording begins with exchanging ideas after which the band enters the studio and discusses the concept, direction, artwork, and song titles. The lyrics are usually written after the music is arranged. Discussing the band's lyrics, Mustaine said that many of the themes are derived from literature, such as the novels of <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>.

The music of Megadeth and its underground metal contemporaries from the 1980s featured harsh vocals, <a href="double%20bass%20drum">double bass drum</a> patterns, <a href="staccato">staccato</a> riffing, <a href="power%20chords">power chords</a>, <a href="tremolo%20picking">tremolo picking</a>, and screeching lead guitar work; albums from this period were produced on low budgets. After forming Megadeth, Mustaine followed the thrash metal style of his previous band, Metallica, with more emphasis on speed and intensity. Megadeth's music is characterized by its neat instrumental performance, featuring fast rhythm sections, complex arrangements, and snarling vocals. When asked to describe Megadeth's guitar style, Mustaine answered: "When you go to a show and see a guitar player who just stands there, that's a guitar player. A thrash guitar player is a guy who plays like he wants to beat the guitar's guts out." Most of the songs are recorded in standard <a href="guitar%20tuning">guitar tuning</a> as Mustaine believes it to provide a superior melody to alternative methods of tuning.
In 2017, David Ellefson talked in an interview about how the band recently started to use a lower tuning saying: "it's just natural with age, for singers it can be a struggle, so rather than quit, than not play, how do you work it around? Well, let's drop the guitars, let's find a way to work around it."

During the band's early days, Mustaine was the rhythm guitarist, while Chris Poland played lead. Although Poland performed only on Megadeth's first two albums, music journalists Pete Prown and Harvey P. Newquist credit him with making the music more colorful because of his <a href="jazz">jazz</a> influences. According to former "<a href="Metal%20Maniacs">Metal Maniacs</a>" editor Jeff Wagner, the band's songwriting techniques peaked with the fourth album, "Rust in Peace", which he described as a "flurry of precision and fluidity, making good on Megadeth's claim to being the world's state-of-the-art <a href="speed%20metal">speed metal</a> band". Musicologist Glenn Pillsbury stated the guitar work on the album was a mixture of Mustaine's "controlled chaos" and the "technical brilliance" of Marty Friedman. Studio efforts released in the mid- and late 1990s featured songs with compact structures and less complicated riffing.

Megadeth's lyrics often focus on death, war, politics, and religion. The lyricism centers on nihilistic themes, but occasionally deals with topics such as alienation and social problems. The earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence, and Satanism. <a href="Nuclear%20warfare">Nuclear warfare</a> and government conspiracy were preoccupations on albums such as "Rust in Peace" and "Countdown to Extinction". During Megadeth's commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and intimate relationships. For the lyrics on "Cryptic Writings", Mustaine said that he wanted to write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience. The title of "United Abominations" is a satiric play on the name of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>; Mustaine criticized the organization's ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that album. Later albums contained lyrics in a similar vein.

Having sold about 38 million units worldwide, Megadeth is one of the few bands from the 1980s American underground metal scene to have achieved mass commercial success. Along with contemporaries Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, Megadeth is regarded as one of the core founding groups of thrash metal. These bands are often referred to as the "big four" of thrash metal, responsible for the genre's development and popularization. "<a href="Loudwire">Loudwire</a>" ranked Megadeth the third best thrash metal band of all time, praising the group's "provoking lyrics and mind-warping virtuosity". "CMJ New Music Report" called the band's debut album a seminal release and a representative of "the golden age of speed metal". Similarly, <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a> called the band's second album "Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?" a "landmark of the thrash movement" whose lyrics it found still relevant. MTV also recognized the band as an influential metal act, highlighting the technical aspect of the early albums.

Megadeth is considered one of the most musically influential groups that originated in the 1980s. As part of the early American thrash metal movement, the band's music was a direct influence on <a href="death%20metal">death metal</a>. Sociologist <a href="Keith%20Kahn-Harris">Keith Kahn-Harris</a> wrote that the mainstream success of Megadeth was one of the reasons for the expansion of <a href="extreme%20metal">extreme metal</a> to countries where it had previously been unknown. The band's sound and album artwork influenced a number of thrash metal bands in the 21st century, including <a href="Toxic%20Holocaust">Toxic Holocaust</a> and <a href="Warbringer">Warbringer</a>. According to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>, Megadeth has sold 9.2 million copies of its albums in the United States between 1991 and 2014.

Mellitus

Mellitus (died 24 April 624) was the first <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a> in the Saxon period, the third <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, and a member of the <a href="Gregorian%20mission">Gregorian mission</a> sent to England to <a href="Christianization">convert</a> the <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a>s from their native <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">paganism</a> to Christianity. He arrived in 601 AD with a group of clergy sent to augment the mission, and was consecrated as Bishop of London in 604. Mellitus was the recipient of a famous letter from Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Gregory I</a> known as the "<a href="Epistola%20ad%20Mellitum">Epistola ad Mellitum</a>", preserved in a later work by the medieval chronicler <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, which suggested the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons be undertaken gradually, integrating pagan rituals and customs. In 610, Mellitus returned to Italy to attend a council of bishops, and returned to England bearing papal letters to some of the missionaries.

Mellitus was exiled from London by the pagan successors to his patron, King <a href="S%C3%A6berht%20of%20Essex">Sæberht of Essex</a>, following the latter's death around 616. King <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht of Kent</a>, Mellitus' other patron, died at about the same time, forcing him to take refuge in <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>. Mellitus returned to England the following year, after Æthelberht's successor had been converted to Christianity, but he was unable to return to London, whose inhabitants remained pagan. Mellitus was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 619. During his tenure, he was alleged to have miraculously saved the cathedral, and much of the town of Canterbury, from a fire. After his death in 624, Mellitus was revered as a saint.

The medieval chronicler Bede described Mellitus as being of noble birth. In letters, Pope Gregory I called him an <a href="abbot">abbot</a>, but it is unclear whether Mellitus had previously been abbot of a Roman monastery, or this was a rank bestowed on him to ease his journey to England by making him the leader of the expedition. The papal register, a listing of letters sent out by the popes, describes him as an "abbot in Frankia" in its description of the correspondence, but the letter itself only says "abbot". The first time Mellitus is mentioned in history is in the letters of Gregory, and nothing else of his background is known. It appears likely that he was a native of Italy, along with all the other bishops consecrated by Augustine.

Pope Gregory I sent Mellitus to England in June 601, in response to an appeal from <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine</a>, the first Archbishop of Canterbury. Augustine needed more clergy to join the Gregorian mission that was converting the kingdom of Kent, then ruled by Æthelberht, from paganism to Christianity. The new missionaries brought with them a gift of books and "all things which were needed for worship and the ministry of the Church." <a href="Thomas%20of%20Elmham">Thomas of Elmham</a>, a 15th-century Canterbury chronicler, claimed that in his day there were a number of the books brought to England by Mellitus still at Canterbury. Examination of the remaining manuscripts has determined that one possible survivor of Mellitus' books is the <a href="St%20Augustine%20Gospels">St Augustine Gospels</a>, now in Cambridge, as Corpus Christi College, MS (manuscript) 286. Along with the letter to Augustine, the missionaries brought a letter for Æthelberht, urging the King to act like the Roman Emperor <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine I</a> and force the conversion of his followers to Christianity. The king was also encouraged to destroy all <a href="shrine%23Germanic%20paganism">pagan shrines</a>.

The historian Ian Wood has suggested that Mellitus' journey through Gaul probably took in the bishoprics of Vienne, Arles, Lyons, Toulon, Marseilles, Metz, Paris, and Rouen, as evidenced by the letters that Gregory addressed to those bishops soliciting their support for Mellitus' party. Gregory also wrote to the <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> kings <a href="Chlothar%20II">Chlothar II</a>, <a href="Theuderic%20II">Theuderic II</a>, <a href="Theudebert%20II">Theudebert II</a>, along with <a href="Brunhilda%20of%20Austrasia">Brunhilda of Austrasia</a>, who was Theudebert and Theuderic's grandmother and regent. Wood feels that this wide appeal to the Frankish episcopate and royalty was an effort to secure more support for the Gregorian mission. While on his journey to England, Mellitus received a letter from Gregory allowing Augustine to convert <a href="heathen%20hofs">pagan temples</a> to Christian churches, and to convert <a href="bl%C3%B3t">pagan animal sacrifices</a> into Christian feasts, to ease the transition to Christianity. Gregory's letter marked a sea change in the missionary strategy, and was later included in Bede's "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>". Usually known as the "Epistola ad Mellitum", it conflicts with the letter sent to Æthelberht, which the historian R. A. Markus sees as a turning point in missionary history, when forcible conversion gave way to persuasion. This traditional view, that the "Epistola" represents a contradiction of the letter to Æthelberht, has been challenged by the historian and theologian George Demacopoulos, who argues that the letter to Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the King in spiritual matters, while the "Epistola" was sent to deal with purely practical matters, and thus the two do not contradict each other.

Exactly when Mellitus and his party arrived in England is unknown, but he was certainly in the country by 604, when Augustine consecrated him as <a href="bishop">bishop</a> in the province of the <a href="East%20Saxon">East Saxon</a>s, making Mellitus the first Bishop of London after the Roman departure (London was the East Saxons' capital). The city was a logical choice for a new bishopric, as it was a hub for the southern road network. It was also a former Roman town; many of the Gregorian mission's efforts were centred in such locations. Before his consecration, Mellitus baptised Sæberht, Æthelberht's nephew, who then allowed the bishopric to be established. The episcopal church built in London was probably founded by Æthelberht, rather than Sæberht. Although Bede records that Æthelberht gave lands to support the new episcopate, a charter that claims to be a grant of lands from Æthelberht to Mellitus is a later forgery.

Although Gregory had intended London to be the southern archbishopric for the island, Augustine never moved his <a href="episcopal%20see">episcopal see</a> to London, and instead consecrated Mellitus as a plain bishop there. After Augustine's death in 604, Canterbury continued to be the site of the southern archbishopric, and London remained a bishopric. It may have been that the Kentish king did not wish greater episcopal authority to be exercised outside his own kingdom.

Mellitus attended a council of bishops held in Italy in February 610, convened by Pope <a href="Pope%20Boniface%20IV">Boniface IV</a>. The historian N. J. Higham speculates that one reason for his attendance may have been to assert the English Church's independence from the Frankish Church. Boniface had Mellitus take two papal letters back to England, one to Æthelbert and his people, and another to <a href="Laurence%20of%20Canterbury">Laurence</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He also brought back the synod's decrees to England. No authentic letters or documents from this synod remain, although some were forged in the 1060s and 1070s at Canterbury. During his time as a bishop, Mellitus joined with <a href="Justus">Justus</a>, the Bishop of Rochester, in signing a letter that Laurence wrote to the Celtic bishops urging the <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">Celtic Church</a> to adopt the Roman method of calculating the <a href="Easter%20controversy">date of Easter</a>. This letter also mentioned the fact that Irish missionary bishops, such as <a href="Dagan%20%28bishop%29">Dagan</a>, refused to eat with the Roman missionaries.

Both Æthelberht and Sæberht died around 616 or 618, causing a crisis for the mission. Sæberht's three sons had not converted to Christianity, and drove Mellitus from London. Bede says that Mellitus was exiled because he refused the brothers' request for a taste of the <a href="Eucharist%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">sacramental bread</a>. Whether this occurred immediately after Sæberht's death or later is impossible to determine from Bede's chronology, which has both events in the same chapter but gives neither an exact time frame nor the elapsed time between the two events. The historian N. J. Higham connects the timing of this episode with a change in the "overkingship" from the Christian Kentish Æthelberht to the pagan East Anglian <a href="Raedwald">Raedwald</a>, which Higham feels happened after Æthelberht's death. In Higham's view, Sæberht's sons drove Mellitus from London because they had passed from Kentish overlordship to East Anglian, and thus no longer needed to keep Mellitus, who was connected with the Kentish kingdom, in office.

Mellitus fled first to Canterbury, but Æthelberht's successor <a href="Eadbald%20of%20Kent">Eadbald</a> was also a pagan, so Mellitus, accompanied by Justus, took refuge in Gaul. Mellitus was recalled to Britain by Laurence, the second Archbishop of Canterbury, after his conversion of Eadbald. How long Mellitus' exile lasted is unclear. Bede claims it was a year, but it may have been longer. However, Mellitus did not return to London, because the East Saxons remained pagan. Although Mellitus fled, there does not seem to have been any serious persecution of Christians in the East Saxon kingdom. The East Saxon see was not occupied again until <a href="Cedd">Cedd</a> was consecrated as bishop in about 654.

Mellitus succeeded Laurence as the third Archbishop of Canterbury after the latter's death in 619. During his tenure as archbishop, Mellitus supposedly performed a miracle in 623 by diverting a fire that had started in <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a> and threatened the church. He was carried into the flames, upon which the wind changed direction, thus saving the building. Bede praised Mellitus' sane mind, but other than the miracle, little happened during his time as archbishop. Bede also mentioned that Mellitus suffered from <a href="gout">gout</a>. Boniface wrote to Mellitus encouraging him in the mission, perhaps prompted by the marriage of <a href="%C3%86thelburh%20of%20Kent">Æthelburh of Kent</a> to King <a href="Edwin%20of%20Northumbria">Edwin of Northumbria</a>. Whether Mellitus received a <a href="pallium">pallium</a>, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, from the pope is unknown.

Mellitus died on 24 April 624, and was buried at <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's Abbey</a> in Canterbury that same day. He became revered as a saint after his death, and was allotted the feast day of 24 April. In the ninth century, Mellitus' feast day was mentioned in the <a href="Stowe%20Missal">Stowe Missal</a>, along with Laurence and Justus. He was still venerated at St Augustine's in 1120, along with a number of other local saints. There was also a shrine to him at <a href="Old%20St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">Old St Paul's Cathedral</a> in London. Shortly after the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a>, <a href="Goscelin">Goscelin</a> wrote a life of Mellitus, the first of several to appear around that time, but none contain any information not included in Bede's earlier works. These later medieval lives do, however, reveal that during Goscelin's lifetime persons suffering from gout were urged to pray at Mellitus' tomb. Goscelin records that Mellitus' shrine flanked that of Augustine, along with Laurence, in the eastern central chapel of the <a href="Presbytery%20%28architecture%29">presbytery</a>.

Malcolm X

Malcolm X
(19251965) was an American <a href="Islam%20in%20the%20United%20States">Muslim</a> minister and <a href="human%20rights%20activists">human rights activist</a> who was a popular figure during the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a>. He is best known for his controversial advocacy for the rights of blacks; some consider him a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans, while others accused him of preaching <a href="racism">racism</a> and violence. 

Born Malcolm Little in <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, he relocated to New York City's <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a> neighborhood in 1943, after spending his teenage years in a series of <a href="foster%20home">foster home</a>s following his father's murder and his mother's hospitalization. In New York, MalcolmX engaged in several illicit activities, eventually being sentenced to ten years in prison in 1946 for <a href="larceny">larceny</a> and breaking and entering. In prison, he joined the <a href="Nation%20of%20Islam">Nation of Islam</a> (NOI), and quickly became one of the organization's most influential leaders after being paroled in 1952.

During the civil rights movement, MalcolmX served as the public face of the controversial group for a dozen years, where he advocated for <a href="black%20supremacy">black supremacy</a>, the <a href="Black%20separatism">separation of black and white Americans</a>, and rejected the notion of the civil rights movement for its emphasis on <a href="racial%20integration">racial integration</a>. He also expressed pride in some of the social achievements he made with the Nation, particularly its free <a href="Drug%20rehabilitation">drug rehabilitation program</a>. In the 1950s, MalcolmX endured surveillance from the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) for the Nation's supposed links to <a href="communism">communism</a>.

In the 1960s, MalcolmX began to grow disillusioned with the Nation of Islam, and in particular, with its leader <a href="Elijah%20Muhammad">Elijah Muhammad</a>. Expressing many regrets about his time with them, which he had come to regard as largely wasted, he instead embraced <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Islam</a>. MalcolmX then began to advocate for racial integration and disavowed racism after completing <a href="Hajj">Hajj</a>, whereby he also became known as el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz. After a brief period of travel across Africa, he notably repudiated the Nation of Islam, and founded <a href="Muslim%20Mosque%2C%20Inc.">Muslim Mosque, Inc.</a> (MMI) and the <a href="Organization%20of%20Afro-American%20Unity">Organization of Afro-American Unity</a> (OAAU) to emphasize <a href="Pan-Africanism">Pan-Africanism</a>.

Throughout 1964, his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, and he was repeatedly sent death threats. On February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was planning to address the OAAU in Manhattan, when he was assassinated by <a href="Thomas%20Hagan">Thomas Hagan</a>, Thomas Johnson, and Norman Butler; three members of the Nation of Islam. The trio were sentenced to indeterminate life sentences, and were required to serve a minimum of 20 years in prison. Conspiracies regarding the assassination, whether it was conceived or aided by leading members of the Nation or with law enforcement agencies, have persisted for decades after the shooting. 

Malcolm X was posthumously honored with <a href="Malcolm%20X%20Day">Malcolm X Day</a>, where he is commemorated in various cities and countries worldwide. Hundreds of streets and schools in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, while the <a href="Audubon%20Ballroom">Audubon Ballroom</a>, the site of his assassination, was in-part redeveloped in 2005 to accommodate the <a href="Malcolm%20X%20and%20Dr.%20Betty%20Shabazz%20Memorial%20and%20Educational%20Center">Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center</a>.

Malcolm Little was born May19, 1925, in <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, the fourth of seven children of <a href="Grenada">Grenada</a>-born <a href="Louise%20Little%20%28activist%29">Louise Helen Little</a> (née Norton) and <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>-born Earl Little. Earl was an outspoken <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> <a href="Laity">lay</a> speaker, and he and Louise were admirers of <a href="Pan-Africanism">Pan-African</a> activist <a href="Marcus%20Garvey">Marcus Garvey</a>. Earl was a local leader of the <a href="Universal%20Negro%20Improvement%20Association">Universal Negro Improvement Association</a> (UNIA) and Louise served as secretary and "branch reporter", sending news of local UNIA activities to "<a href="Negro%20World">Negro World</a>"; they inculcated self-reliance and <a href="black%20pride">black pride</a> in their children. MalcolmX later said that white violence killed four of his father's brothers.

Because of <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> threatsEarl's UNIA activities were said to be "spreading trouble"the family relocated in 1926 to <a href="Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>, and shortly thereafter to <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing, Michigan</a>. There the family was frequently harassed by the <a href="Black%20Legion%20%28political%20movement%29">Black Legion</a>, a white <a href="racism%20in%20the%20United%20States">racist</a> group. When the family home burned in 1929, Earl accused the Black Legion.

When Malcolm was six, his father died in what was officially ruled a <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a> accident, though his mother Louise believed Earl had been murdered by the Black Legion. Rumors that white racists were responsible for his father's death were widely circulated and were very disturbing to Malcolm X as a child. As an adult, he expressed conflicting beliefs on the question. After a dispute with creditors, Louise received a life insurance benefit
(nominally $1,000about $,000 in 2018 dollars) in payments of $18 per month; the issuer of another, larger policy refused to pay, claiming her husband Earl had committed suicide. To make ends meet Louise rented out part of her garden, and her sons hunted game.

In 1937 a man Louise had been datingmarriage had seemed a possibilityvanished from her life when she became pregnant with his child. In late 1938 she had a <a href="Mental%20breakdown">nervous breakdown</a> and was committed to <a href="Kalamazoo%20Regional%20Psychiatric%20Hospital">Kalamazoo State Hospital</a>. The children were separated and sent to <a href="Foster%20care">foster homes</a>. Malcolm and his siblings secured her release 24 years later.

Malcolm Little excelled in junior high school but dropped out after a white teacher told him that practicing law, his aspiration at the time, was "no realistic goal for a nigger". Later MalcolmX recalled feeling that the white world offered no place for a career-oriented black man, regardless of talent.

From age 14 to 21, Little held a variety of jobs while living with his half-sister <a href="Ella%20Little-Collins">Ella Little-Collins</a> in <a href="Roxbury%2C%20Boston">Roxbury</a>, a largely <a href="African-American%20neighborhood">African-American neighborhood</a> of Boston.

After a short time in <a href="Flint%2C%20Michigan">Flint</a>, Michigan, he moved to New York City's <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a> neighborhood in 1943, where he engaged in drug dealing, gambling, <a href="Racket%20%28crime%29">racketeering</a>, robbery, and <a href="Procuring%20%28prostitution%29">pimping</a>.
According to recent biographies, Little also occasionally had sex with other men, usually for money. He befriended John Elroy Sanford, a fellow dishwasher at Jimmy's Chicken Shack in Harlem who aspired to be a professional comedian. Both men had reddish hair, so Sanford was called "Chicago Red" after his hometown and Little was known as "Detroit Red". Years later, Sanford became famous as <a href="Redd%20Foxx">Redd Foxx</a>.

Summoned by the local <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States%23World%20War%20II">draft board</a> for military service in World WarII, he feigned mental disturbance by rambling and declaring: "I want to be sent down South. Organize them nigger soldiers... steal us some guns, and kill us [some] <a href="Cracker%20%28pejorative%29">crackers</a>". He was declared "mentally disqualified for military service".

In late 1945, Little returned to Boston, where he and four accomplices committed a series of burglaries targeting wealthy white families. In 1946, he was arrested while picking up a stolen watch he had left at a shop for repairs, and in February began serving an eight-to-ten-year sentence at <a href="Charlestown%20State%20Prison">Charlestown State Prison</a> for larceny and breaking and entering.

When Little was in prison, he met fellow convict John Bembry, a self-educated man he would later describe as "the first man I had ever seen command total respect... with words". Under Bembry's influence, Little developed a voracious appetite for reading.

At this time, several of his siblings wrote to him about the <a href="Nation%20of%20Islam">Nation of Islam</a>, a relatively new religious movement preaching black self-reliance and, ultimately, the return of the <a href="African%20diaspora">African diaspora</a> to Africa, where they would be free from white American and European domination. He showed scant interest at first, but after his brother Reginald wrote in 1948, "Malcolm, don't eat any more pork and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll show you how to get out of prison", he quit smoking and began to refuse pork. After a visit in which Reginald described the group's teachings, including the belief that white people are devils, Little concluded that every relationship he'd had with whites had been tainted by dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred. Little, whose hostility to religion had earned him the prison nickname "Satan", became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam.

In late 1948, Little wrote to <a href="Elijah%20Muhammad">Elijah Muhammad</a>, the leader of the Nation of Islam. Muhammad advised him to renounce his past, humbly bow in prayer to <a href="God%20in%20Islam">God</a>, and promise never to engage in destructive behavior again. Though he later recalled the inner struggle he had before bending his knees to pray, Little soon became a member of the Nation of Islam,
maintaining a regular correspondence with Muhammad.

In 1950, the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> opened a file on Little after he wrote a letter from prison to <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">President Truman</a> expressing opposition to the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and declaring himself a Communist. That year, Little also began signing his name "MalcolmX". He explained in his autobiography that the Muslim's "X" symbolized the true African family name that he could never know. "For me, my 'X' replaced the white slavemaster name of 'Little' which some blue-eyed devil named Little had imposed upon my paternal forebears."

After his parole in August 1952, MalcolmX visited Elijah Muhammad in Chicago. In June 1953 he was named assistant minister of the Nation's Temple Number One in Detroit. Later that year he established Boston's Temple Number11; in March 1954, he expanded Temple Number12 in Philadelphia; and two months later he was selected to lead <a href="Mosque%20No.%207">Temple Number7</a> in Harlem, where he rapidly expanded its membership.

In 1953, the FBI began surveillance of him, turning its attention from MalcolmX's possible communist associations to his rapid ascent in the Nation of Islam.

During 1955, MalcolmX continued his successful recruitment of members on behalf of the Nation of Islam. He established temples in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield</a>, Massachusetts (Number13); <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford</a>, Connecticut (Number14); and <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> (Number15). Hundreds of African Americans were joining the Nation of Islam every month.

Besides his skill as a speaker, MalcolmX had an impressive physical presence. He stood tall and weighed about . One writer described him as "powerfully built", and another as "mesmerizingly handsome... and always spotlessly well-groomed".

In 1955, <a href="Betty%20Shabazz">Betty Sanders</a> met MalcolmX after one of his lectures, then again at a dinner party; soon she was regularly attending his lectures. In 1956 she joined the Nation of Islam, changing her name to BettyX. One-on-one dates were contrary to the Nation's teachings, so the couple courted at social events with dozens or hundreds of others, and MalcolmX made a point of inviting her on the frequent group visits he led to New York City's museums and libraries.

MalcolmX proposed during a telephone call from Detroit in January 1958, and they married two days later. They had six daughters:
<a href="Attallah%20Shabazz">Attallah</a> (b. 1958, named after <a href="Attila%20the%20Hun">Attila the Hun</a>);
<a href="Qubilah%20Shabazz">Qubilah</a> (b. 1960, named after <a href="Kublai%20Khan">Kublai Khan</a>); <a href="Ilyasah%20Shabazz">Ilyasah</a> (b. 1962, named after Elijah Muhammad); Gamilah Lumumba (b. 1964, named after <a href="Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> and <a href="Patrice%20Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a>); and twins Malikah and Malaak (b. 1965 after their father's death, and named in his honor).

The American public first became aware of MalcolmX in 1957, after Hinton Johnson, a Nation of Islam member, was beaten by two New York City police officers. On April26, Johnson and two other passersbyalso Nation of Islam memberssaw the officers beating an African-American man with nightsticks. When they attempted to intervene, shouting, "You're not in Alabama... this is New York!" one of the officers turned on Johnson, beating him so severely that he suffered brain contusions and subdural hemorrhaging. All four African-American men were arrested. Alerted by a witness, MalcolmX and a small group of Muslims went to the police station and demanded to see Johnson. Police initially denied that any Muslims were being held, but when the crowd grew to about five hundred, they allowed MalcolmX to speak with Johnson. Afterward, MalcolmX insisted on arranging for an ambulance to take Johnson to Harlem Hospital.

Johnson's injuries were treated and by the time he was returned to the police station, some four thousand people had gathered outside. Inside the station, MalcolmX and an attorney were making bail arrangements for two of the Muslims. Johnson was not bailed, and police said he could not go back to the hospital until his <a href="arraignment">arraignment</a> the following day. Considering the situation to be at an impasse, MalcolmX stepped outside the station house and gave a hand signal to the crowd. Nation members silently left, after which the rest of the crowd also dispersed. One police officer told the "<a href="New%20York%20Amsterdam%20News">New York Amsterdam News</a>": "No one man should have that much power." Within a month the New York City Police Department arranged to keep MalcolmX under surveillance; it also made inquiries with authorities in other cities in which he had lived, and prisons in which he had served time. A <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> declined to indict the officers who beat Johnson. In October, MalcolmX sent an angry telegram to the police commissioner. Soon the police department assigned undercover officers to infiltrate the Nation of Islam.

By the late 1950s, MalcolmX was using a new name, Malcolm Shabazz or Malik el-Shabazz, although he was still widely referred to as MalcolmX. His comments on issues and events were being widely reported in print, on radio, and on television, and he was featured in a 1959 New York City television broadcast about the Nation of Islam, "<a href="The%20Hate%20That%20Hate%20Produced">The Hate That Hate Produced</a>".

In September 1960, at the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> in New York City, MalcolmX was invited to the official functions of several African nations. He met <a href="Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> of Egypt, <a href="Ahmed%20S%C3%A9kou%20Tour%C3%A9">Ahmed Sékou Touré</a> of Guinea, and <a href="Kenneth%20Kaunda">Kenneth Kaunda</a> of the <a href="Zambian%20African%20National%20Congress">Zambian African National Congress</a>. <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a> also attended the Assembly, and MalcolmX met publicly with him as part of a welcoming committee of Harlem community leaders. Castro was sufficiently impressed with MalcolmX to suggest a private meeting, and after two hours of talking, Castro invited MalcolmX to visit Cuba.

From his adoption of the Nation of Islam in 1952 until he broke with it in 1964, MalcolmX promoted the <a href="%23Beliefs%20of%20the%20Nation%20of%20Islam">Nation's teachings</a>. These included the beliefs:

Many whites and some blacks were alarmed by MalcolmX and the statements he made during this period. He and the Nation of Islam were described as hatemongers, black supremacists, racists, violence-seekers, segregationists, and a threat to improved race relations. He was accused of being <a href="Antisemitism">antisemitic</a>. One of the goals of the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a> was to end <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era">disenfranchisement</a> of African Americans, but the Nation of Islam forbade its members from participating in voting and other aspects of the political process. Civil rights organizations denounced him and the Nation as irresponsible extremists whose views did not represent African Americans.

MalcolmX was equally critical of the civil rights movement. He labeled <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> a "chump" and other civil rights leaders "stooges" of the white establishment. He called the 1963 <a href="March%20on%20Washington%20for%20Jobs%20and%20Freedom">March on Washington</a> "the farce on Washington", and said he did not know why so many black people were excited about a demonstration "run by whites in front of a statue of a president who has been dead for a hundred years and who didn't like us when he was alive".

While the civil rights movement fought against <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial segregation</a>, MalcolmX advocated the complete <a href="Black%20separatism">separation</a> of African Americans from whites. He proposed that <a href="Back-to-Africa%20movement">African Americans should return to Africa</a> and that, in the interim, a separate country for black people in America should be created. He rejected the civil rights movement's strategy of <a href="nonviolence">nonviolence</a>, expressing the opinion that black people should defend and advance themselves "<a href="by%20any%20means%20necessary">by any means necessary</a>". His speeches had a powerful effect on his audiences, who were generally African Americans in <a href="Northern%20United%20States">northern</a> and <a href="Western%20United%20States">western</a> cities. Many of themtired of being told to wait for freedom, justice, equality and respectfelt that he articulated their complaints better than did the civil rights movement.

MalcolmX is widely regarded as the second most influential leader of the Nation of Islam after Elijah Muhammad. He was largely credited with the group's dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s (from 500 to 25,000 by one estimate; from 1,200 to 50,000 or 75,000 by another).

He inspired the boxer Cassius Clay (later known as <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>) to join the Nation, and the two became close; 
In January 1964, Clay brought MalcolmX and his family to Miami to watch him train for <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20vs.%20Sonny%20Liston%23Liston%20vs.%20Clay">his fight against Sonny Liston</a>.
When MalcolmX left the Nation of Islam, he tried to convince Clay to join him in converting to <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Islam</a>, but Clay instead broke ties with himwhich Clay later described as one of his greatest regrets.

MalcolmX mentored and guided LouisX (later known as <a href="Louis%20Farrakhan">Louis Farrakhan</a>), who eventually became the leader of the Nation of Islam. MalcolmX also served as a mentor and confidant to Elijah Muhammad's son, <a href="Warith%20Deen%20Mohammed">Wallace D. Muhammad</a>; the son told Malcolm X about his skepticism toward his father's "unorthodox approach" to Islam. Wallace Muhammad was excommunicated from the Nation of Islam several times, although he was eventually readmitted.

During 1962 and 1963, events caused MalcolmX to reassess his relationship with the Nation of Islam, and particularly its leader, Elijah Muhammad.

In late 1961, there were violent confrontations between NOI members and police in South Central Los Angeles, and numerous Muslims were arrested. They were acquitted, but tensions had been raised. Just after midnight on April27, 1962, two <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department">LAPD</a> officers shoved and beat several Muslims outside Temple Number 27 without provocation. A large crowd of angry Muslims came outside from the mosque. The officers attempted to intimidate the crowd. One officer was disarmed by the crowd; his partner was shot in the elbow by a third officer. More than 70 backup officers arrived. They raided the mosque and randomly beat NOI members. Police officers shot seven Muslims, including William X Rogers, who was hit in the back and paralyzed for life, and Ronald Stokes, a Korean War veteran, who was shot from behind while raising his hands over his head to surrender, killing him.

A number of Muslims were indicted after the event, but no charges were made against the police. Furthermore, the coroner ruled that Stokes's killing was justified. To MalcolmX, the desecration of the mosque and the violence demanded action, and he used what Farrakhan later called his "gangsterlike past" to rally the more hardened of the NOI members to take violent action against the police. MalcolmX sought Elijah Muhammad's approval but was denied. MalcolmX was stunned by this response. MalcolmX also spoke of the NOI starting to work with civil rights organizations, local black politicians, and religious groups, another initiative blocked by Muhammad. LouisX saw this as an important turning point in the deteriorating relationship between MalcolmX and Muhammad.

Rumors were circulating that Muhammad was conducting extramarital affairs with young Nation secretarieswhich would constitute a serious violation of Nation teachings. After first discounting the rumors, MalcolmX came to believe them after he spoke with Muhammad's son <a href="Warith%20Deen%20Mohammed">Wallace</a> and with the women making the accusations. Muhammad confirmed the rumors in 1963, attempting to justify his behavior by referring to precedents set by Biblical prophets.

On December1, 1963, when asked for a comment about the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination">assassination of President John F. Kennedy</a>, MalcolmX said that it was a case of "<a href="wikt%3A%20come%20home%20to%20roost">chickens coming home to roost</a>". He added that "chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they've always made me glad." "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote, "in further criticism of Mr. Kennedy, the Muslim leader cited the murders of <a href="Patrice%20Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a>, Congo leader, of <a href="Medgar%20Evers">Medgar Evers</a>, civil rights leader, and of the <a href="16th%20Street%20Baptist%20Church%20bombing">Negro girls bombed</a> earlier this year in a <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham</a> church. These, he said, were instances of other 'chickens coming home to roost'." The remarks prompted a widespread public outcry. The Nation of Islam, which had sent a message of condolence to the Kennedy family and ordered its ministers not to comment on the assassination, publicly censured their former shining star. MalcolmX retained his post and rank as minister, but was prohibited from public speaking for 90 days.

MalcolmX had by now become a media favorite, and some Nation members believed he was a threat to Muhammad's leadership. Publishers had shown interest in MalcolmX's autobiography, and when <a href="Louis%20Lomax">Louis Lomax</a> wrote his 1963 book about the Nation, "When the Word Is Given", he used a photograph of MalcolmX on the cover. He also reproduced five of his speeches, but featured only one of Muhammad'sall of which greatly upset Muhammad and made him envious.

On March8, 1964, MalcolmX publicly announced his break from the Nation of Islam. He was still a Muslim, he said, but felt that the Nation had "gone as far as it can" because of its rigid teachings. He said he was planning to organize a <a href="Black%20nationalism">black nationalist</a> organization to "heighten the political consciousness" of African Americans. He also expressed a desire to work with other civil rights leaders, saying that Elijah Muhammad had prevented him from doing so in the past.

After leaving the Nation of Islam, MalcolmX founded <a href="Muslim%20Mosque%2C%20Inc.">Muslim Mosque, Inc.</a> (MMI), a religious organization, and the <a href="Organization%20of%20Afro-American%20Unity">Organization of Afro-American Unity</a> (OAAU), a secular group that advocated <a href="Pan-Africanism">Pan-Africanism</a>. On March26, 1964, he met <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> for the first and only timeand only long enough for photographs to be takenin Washington, D.C., as both men attended the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate's</a> debate on the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights bill</a>. In April, MalcolmX gave a speech titled "<a href="The%20Ballot%20or%20the%20Bullet">The Ballot or the Bullet</a>", in which he advised African Americans to exercise their right to vote wisely but cautioned that if the government continued to prevent African Americans from attaining full equality, it might be necessary for them to take up arms.

In the weeks after he left the Nation of Islam, several <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Muslims</a> encouraged MalcolmX to learn about their faith. He soon converted to the Sunni faith.

In April 1964, with financial help from his half-sister Ella Little-Collins, MalcolmX flew to <a href="Jeddah">Jeddah</a>, Saudi Arabia, as the start of his <a href="Hajj">Hajj</a>, the pilgrimage to <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> obligatory for every Muslim who is able to do so. He was delayed in Jeddah when his U.S. citizenship and inability to speak <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> caused his status as a Muslim to be questioned. He had received <a href="Abdul%20Rahman%20Hassan%20Azzam">Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam</a>'s book "The Eternal Message of Muhammad" with his visa approval, and he contacted the author. Azzam's son arranged for his release and lent him his personal hotel suite. The next morning MalcolmX learned that <a href="Faisal%20of%20Saudi%20Arabia">Prince Faisal</a> had designated him as a state guest. Several days later, after completing the Hajj rituals, MalcolmX had an audience with the prince.

MalcolmX later said that seeing Muslims of "all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans," interacting as equals led him to see Islam as a means by which racial problems could be overcome.

MalcolmX had already visited the <a href="United%20Arab%20Republic">United Arab Republic</a> (a short-lived political union between Egypt and Syria), Sudan, Nigeria, and Ghana in 1959 to make arrangements for a tour of Africa by Elijah Muhammad. After his journey to Mecca in 1964, he visited Africa a second time. He returned to the United States in late May and flew to Africa again in July. During these visits he met officials, gave interviews, and spoke on radio and television in Egypt, Ethiopia, <a href="Tanganyika">Tanganyika</a>, Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Senegal, Liberia, Algeria, and Morocco. In Cairo, he attended the second meeting of the <a href="Organization%20of%20African%20Unity">Organization of African Unity</a> as a representative of the OAAU. By the end of this third visit, he had met with essentially all of Africa's prominent leaders; <a href="Kwame%20Nkrumah">Kwame Nkrumah</a> of Ghana, <a href="Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a> of Egypt, and <a href="Ahmed%20Ben%20Bella">Ahmed Ben Bella</a> of Algeria had all invited MalcolmX to serve in their governments. After he spoke at the <a href="University%20of%20Ibadan">University of Ibadan</a>, the Nigerian Muslim Students Association bestowed on him the honorary <a href="Yoruba%20language">Yoruba</a> name "Omowale" ("the son who has come home"). He later called this his most treasured honor.

On November23, 1964, on his way home from Africa, MalcolmX stopped in Paris, where he spoke in the <a href="Maison%20de%20la%20Mutualit%C3%A9">Salle de la Mutualité</a>. A week later, on November30, MalcolmX flew to the United Kingdom, and on December3 took part in a <a href="Debate%23Oxford-Style%20debate">debate</a> at the <a href="Oxford%20Union">Oxford Union</a> Society. The motion was taken from a statement made earlier that year by <a href="Barry%20Goldwater%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201964">U.S. presidential candidate</a> <a href="Barry%20Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a>: "Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is No Vice; Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is No Virtue". MalcolmX argued for the affirmative, and interest in the debate was so high that it was televised nationally by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>.

On February5, 1965, MalcolmX flew to Britain again, and on February8 he addressed the first meeting of the Council of African Organizations in London. The next day he tried to return to France, but was refused entry.

On February12, he visited <a href="Smethwick">Smethwick</a>, near <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, where the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> <a href="Smethwick%20in%20the%201964%20general%20election">had won the parliamentary seat</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201964">1964 general election</a>. The town had become a byword for racial division after Conservative supporters used the slogan, "If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a>." In Smethwick he compared the treatment of ethnic minority residents with the treatment of Jews under Hitler, saying: "I would not wait for the fascist element in Smethwick to erect gas ovens."

After returning to the U.S., MalcolmX addressed a wide variety of audiences. He spoke regularly at meetings held by MMI and the OAAU, and was one of the most sought-after speakers on college campuses. One of his top aides later wrote that he "welcomed every opportunity to speak to college students". He also addressed public meetings of the <a href="Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Socialist Workers Party</a>, speaking at their Militant Labor Forum. He was interviewed on the subjects of segregation and the Nation of Islam by <a href="Robert%20Penn%20Warren">Robert Penn Warren</a> for Warren's 1965 book "<a href="Who%20Speaks%20for%20the%20Negro%3F">Who Speaks for the Negro?</a>"

Throughout 1964, as his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, MalcolmX was repeatedly threatened.

In February, a leader of Temple Number Seven ordered the bombing of MalcolmX's car. In March, Muhammad told Boston minister LouisX (later known as <a href="Louis%20Farrakhan">Louis Farrakhan</a>) that "hypocrites like Malcolm should have their heads cut off"; the April10 edition of "<a href="Muhammad%20Speaks">Muhammad Speaks</a>" featured a cartoon depicting MalcolmX's bouncing, severed head.

On June8, FBI surveillance recorded a telephone call in which Betty Shabazz was told that her husband was "as good as dead". Four days later, an FBI informant received a tip that "MalcolmX is going to be bumped off." (That same month the Nation sued to reclaim MalcolmX's residence in <a href="East%20Elmhurst%2C%20Queens">East Elmhurst</a>, <a href="Queens">Queens</a>, New York. His family was ordered to vacate but on February14, 1965the night before a hearing on postponing the evictionthe house was destroyed by fire.)

On July9, Muhammad aide John Ali (suspected of being an undercover FBI agent) referred to MalcolmX by saying, "Anyone who opposes the Honorable Elijah Muhammad puts their life in jeopardy." In the December4 issue of "Muhammad Speaks", LouisX wrote that "such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death".

The September 1964 issue of "<a href="Ebony%20%28magazine%29">Ebony</a>" dramatized MalcolmX's defiance of these threats by publishing a photograph of him holding an <a href="M1%20carbine">M1 carbine</a> while peering out a window.

On February19, 1965, MalcolmX told interviewer <a href="Gordon%20Parks">Gordon Parks</a> that the Nation of Islam was actively trying to kill him. On February21, 1965, he was preparing to address the OAAU in Manhattan's <a href="Audubon%20Ballroom">Audubon Ballroom</a> when someone in the 400-person audience yelled,
"Nigger! Get your hand outta my pocket!"
As MalcolmX and his bodyguards tried to quell the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot him once in the chest with a <a href="sawed-off%20shotgun">sawed-off shotgun</a> and two other men charged the stage firing semi-automatic handguns. MalcolmX was pronounced dead at 3:30pm, shortly after arriving at <a href="Columbia%20University%20Medical%20Center">Columbia Presbyterian Hospital</a>. The autopsy identified 21 gunshot wounds to the chest, left shoulder, arms and legs, including ten buckshot wounds from the initial shotgun blast.

One gunman, Nation of Islam member <a href="Thomas%20Hagan">Talmadge Hayer</a> (also known as Thomas Hagan), was beaten by the crowd before police arrived. Witnesses identified the other gunmen as Nation members Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson. All three were convicted of murder in March 1966 and sentenced to life in prison.
At trial Hayer confessed, but refused to identify the other assailants except to assert that they were not Butler and Johnson.
In <a href="Hayer%20affidavits">1977 and 1978, he signed affidavits</a> reasserting Butler's and Johnson's innocence, naming four other Nation members as participants in the murder or its planning. These affidavits did not result in the case being reopened.
Butler, today known as Muhammad Abdul Aziz, was paroled in 1985 and became the head of the Nation's <a href="Mosque%20No.%207">Harlem mosque</a> in 1998; he maintains his innocence. In prison Johnson, who changed his name to Khalil Islam, rejected the Nation's teachings and converted to Sunni Islam. Released in 1987, he maintained his innocence until his death in August 2009. Hayer, who also rejected the Nation's teachings while in prison and converted to Sunni Islam, is known today as Mujahid Halim. He was paroled in 2010.

A <a href="CNN">CNN</a> Special Report, "Witnessed: The Assassination of MalcolmX", was broadcast on February17, 2015. It featured interviews with several people who worked with him, including <a href="A.%20Peter%20Bailey">A. Peter Bailey</a> and Earl Grant, as well as the daughter of MalcolmX, Ilyasah Shabazz.

The public viewing, February2326 at Unity Funeral Home in Harlem, was attended by some 14,000 to 30,000 mourners.
For the funeral on February27, loudspeakers were set up for the overflow crowd outside Harlem's thousand-seat Faith Temple of the <a href="Church%20of%20God%20in%20Christ">Church of God in Christ</a>, and a local television station carried the service live.

Among the civil rights leaders attending were <a href="John%20Lewis%20%28Georgia%20politician%29">John Lewis</a>, <a href="Bayard%20Rustin">Bayard Rustin</a>, <a href="James%20Forman">James Forman</a>, <a href="James%20Farmer">James Farmer</a>, <a href="Jesse%20Gray">Jesse Gray</a>, and <a href="Andrew%20Young">Andrew Young</a>. Actor and activist <a href="Ossie%20Davis">Ossie Davis</a> delivered the eulogy, describing MalcolmX as "our shining black prince... who didn't hesitate to die, because he loved us so":
There are those who will consider it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing him out of the history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.

MalcolmX was buried at <a href="Ferncliff%20Cemetery">Ferncliff Cemetery</a> in <a href="Hartsdale%2C%20New%20York">Hartsdale</a>, New York. Friends took up the gravediggers' shovels to complete the burial themselves.

Actor and activist <a href="Ruby%20Dee">Ruby Dee</a> and Juanita Poitier (wife of <a href="Sidney%20Poitier">Sidney Poitier</a>) established the Committee of Concerned Mothers to raise money for a home for his family and for his children's educations.

Reactions to MalcolmX's assassination were varied. In a telegram to Betty Shabazz, <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> expressed his sadness at "the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband". He said,
While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.

<a href="Elijah%20Muhammad">Elijah Muhammad</a> told the annual <a href="Saviours%27%20Day">Savior's Day</a> convention on February26, "MalcolmX got just what he preached", but denied any involvement with the murder. "We didn't want to kill Malcolm and didn't try to kill him", Muhammad said. "We know such ignorant, foolish teachings would bring him to his own end."

Writer <a href="James%20Baldwin">James Baldwin</a>, who had been a friend of MalcolmX's, was in London when he heard the news of the assassination. He responded with indignation towards the reporters interviewing him, shouting, "You did it! It is because of you—the men that created this white supremacy—that this man is dead. You are not guilty, but you did it ... Your mills, your cities, your rape of a continent started all this."

The "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" wrote that "even his sharpest critics recognized his brillianceoften wild, unpredictable and eccentric, but nevertheless possessing promise that must now remain unrealized". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that MalcolmX was "an extraordinary and twisted man" who "turn[ed] many true gifts to evil purpose" and that his life was "strangely and pitifully wasted". "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" called him "an unashamed demagogue" whose "creed was violence."

Outside of the U.S., and particularly in Africa, the press was sympathetic. The "<a href="Daily%20Times%20of%20Nigeria">Daily Times of Nigeria</a>" wrote that MalcolmX would "have a place in the palace of martyrs". The "<a href="Ghanaian%20Times">Ghanaian Times</a>" likened him to <a href="John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a>, <a href="Medgar%20Evers">Medgar Evers</a>, and <a href="Patrice%20Lumumba">Patrice Lumumba</a>, and counted him among "a host of Africans and Americans who were martyred in freedom's cause". In China, the "<a href="People%27s%20Daily">People's Daily</a>" described MalcolmX as a martyr killed by "ruling circles and racists" in the United States; his assassination, the paper wrote, demonstrated that "in dealing with imperialist oppressors, violence must be met with violence". The "<a href="Guangming%20Daily">Guangming Daily</a>", also published in Beijing, stated that "Malcolm was murdered because he fought for freedom and equal rights". in Cuba, "El Mundo" described the assassination as "another racist crime to eradicate by violence the struggle against discrimination".

In a weekly column he wrote for the "<a href="New%20York%20Amsterdam%20News">New York Amsterdam News</a>", King reflected on MalcolmX and his
assassination:

MalcolmX was clearly a product of the hate and violence invested in the Negro's blighted existence in this nation. ...

In his youth, there was no hope, no preaching, teaching or movements of non-violence. ...

It is a testimony to Malcolm's personal depth and integrity that he could not become an underworld Czar, but turned again and again to religion for meaning and destiny. Malcolm was still turning and growing at the time of his brutal and meaningless assassination. ...

Like the murder of Lumumba, the murder of MalcolmX deprives the world of a potentially great leader. I could not agree with either of these men, but I could see in them a capacity for leadership which I could respect, and which was just beginning to mature in judgment and statesmanship.

Within days, the question of who bore responsibility for the assassination was being publicly debated. On February23, James Farmer, the leader of the <a href="Congress%20of%20Racial%20Equality">Congress of Racial Equality</a>, announced at a news conference that local drug dealers, and not the Nation of Islam, were to blame. Others accused the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Police%20Department">NYPD</a>, the FBI, or the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a>, citing the lack of police protection, the ease with which the assassins entered the Audubon Ballroom, and the failure of the police to preserve the crime scene. Earl Grant, one of MalcolmX's associates who was present at the assassination, later wrote:

[A]bout five minutes later, a most incredible scene took place. Into the hall sauntered about a dozen policemen. They were strolling at about the pace one would expect of them if they were patrolling a quiet park. They did not seem to be at all excited or concerned about the circumstances.I could hardly believe my eyes. Here were New York City policemen, entering a room from which at least a dozen shots had been heard, and yet not one of them had his gun out! As a matter of absolute fact, some of them even had their hands in their pockets.

In the 1970s, the public learned about <a href="COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a> and other secret FBI programs established to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights organizations during the 1950s and 1960s. John Ali, national secretary of the Nation of Islam, was believed to have been an FBI undercover agent. MalcolmX had confided to a reporter that Ali exacerbated tensions between him and Elijah Muhammad and that he considered Ali his "archenemy" within the Nation of Islam leadership. Ali had a meeting with Talmadge Hayer, one of the men convicted of killing MalcolmX, the night before the assassination.

The Shabazz family are among those who have accused Louis Farrakhan of involvement in MalcolmX's assassination. In a 1993 speech Farrakhan seemed to acknowledge the possibility that the Nation of Islam was responsible:

Was Malcolm your traitor or ours? And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the "hell" business is it of yours? A nation has to be able to deal with traitors and cutthroats and turncoats.

In a "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>" interview that aired during May 2000, Farrakhan stated that some things he said may have led to the assassination of MalcolmX. "I may have been complicit in words that I spoke", he said. "I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused the loss of life of a human being." A few days later Farrakhan denied that he "ordered the assassination" of MalcolmX, although he again acknowledged that he "created the atmosphere that ultimately led to MalcolmX's assassination".

No consensus has been reached on who was responsible for the assassination. In August 2014, an online petition was started using the <a href="We%20the%20People%20%28petitioning%20system%29">White House online petition mechanism</a> to call on the government to release without alteration any files they still held relating to the murder of MalcolmX. In January 2019, members of the families of MalcolmX, <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, Martin Luther King Jr., and <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> were among dozens of Americans who signed a public statement calling for a <a href="truth%20and%20reconciliation%20commission">truth and reconciliation commission</a> to persuade Congress or the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Justice Department</a> to review the assassinations of all four leaders during the 1960s.

Except for his autobiography, MalcolmX left no published writings. His philosophy is known almost entirely from the many speeches and interviews he gave from 1952 until his death. Many of those speeches, especially from the last year of his life, were recorded and have been published.

While he was a member of the Nation of Islam, MalcolmX taught its beliefs, and his statements often began with the phrase "The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that..." It is virtually impossible now to discern whether MalcolmX's personal beliefs at the time diverged from the teachings of the Nation of Islam. After he left the Nation in 1964, he compared himself to a ventriloquist's dummy who could only say what Elijah Muhammad told him to say.

MalcolmX taught that black people were the original people of the world, and that white people were a race of devils who were created by an evil scientist named <a href="Yakub%20%28Nation%20of%20Islam%29">Yakub</a>. The Nation of Islam believed that black people were superior to white people and that the demise of the white race was imminent. When questioned concerning his statements that white people were devils, MalcolmX said: "history proves the white man is a devil." "Anybody who rapes, and plunders, and enslaves, and steals, and drops hell bombs on people ... anybody who does these things is nothing but a devil."

MalcolmX said that Islam was the "true religion of black mankind" and that Christianity was "the white man's religion" that had been imposed upon African Americans by their slave-masters. He said that the Nation of Islam followed Islam as it was practiced around the world, but the Nation's teachings varied from those of other Muslims because they were adapted to the "uniquely pitiful" condition of black people in the United States. He taught that <a href="Wallace%20Fard%20Muhammad">Wallace Fard Muhammad</a>, the founder of the Nation, was God incarnate, and that Elijah Muhammad was his Messenger, or <a href="Prophet">Prophet</a>.

While the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a> fought against <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial segregation</a>, MalcolmX advocated the complete <a href="Black%20separatism">separation</a> of blacks from whites. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for African Americans in the southern or southwestern United States as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa. MalcolmX suggested the United States government owed <a href="Reparations%20for%20slavery">reparations</a> to black people for the unpaid labor of their <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">ancestors</a>. He also rejected the civil rights movement's strategy of <a href="nonviolence">nonviolence</a>, advocating instead that black people should defend themselves.

After leaving the Nation of Islam, MalcolmX announced his willingness to work with leaders of the civil rights movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for "civil rights" would keep the issue within the United States while changing the focus to "human rights" would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where MalcolmX said the emerging nations of the world would add their support.

MalcolmX argued that if the U.S. government was unwilling or unable to protect black people, black people should protect themselves. He said that he and the other members of the OAAU were determined to defend themselves from aggressors, and to secure freedom, justice and equality "by whatever means necessary".

MalcolmX stressed the global perspective he gained from his international travels. He emphasized the "direct connection" between the domestic struggle of African Americans for equal rights with the independence struggles of <a href="Third%20World">Third World</a> nations. He said that African Americans were wrong when they thought of themselves as a minority; globally, black people were the majority.

In his speeches at the Militant Labor Forum, which was sponsored by the <a href="Socialist%20Workers%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Socialist Workers Party</a>, MalcolmX criticized capitalism. After one such speech, when he was asked what political and economic system he wanted, he said he did not know, but that it was no coincidence the newly independent countries in the Third World were turning toward <a href="socialism">socialism</a>. When a reporter asked him what he thought about socialism, MalcolmX asked whether it was good for black people. When the reporter told him it seemed to be, MalcolmX told him, "Then I'm for it."

Although he no longer called for the separation of black people from white people, MalcolmX continued to advocate black nationalism, which he defined as self-determination for the African-American community. In the last months of his life, however, MalcolmX began to reconsider his support for black nationalism after meeting northern African revolutionaries who, to all appearances, were white.

After his Hajj, MalcolmX articulated a view of white people and racism that represented a deep change from the philosophy he had supported as a minister of the Nation of Islam. In a famous letter from Mecca, he wrote that his experiences with white people during his pilgrimage convinced him to "rearrange" his thinking about race and "toss aside some of [his] previous conclusions". In a conversation with <a href="Gordon%20Parks">Gordon Parks</a>, two days before his assassination, Malcolm said:

[L]istening to leaders like <a href="Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser">Nasser</a>, <a href="Ahmed%20Ben%20Bella">Ben Bella</a>, and <a href="Kwame%20Nkrumah">Nkrumah</a> awakened me to the dangers of racism. I realized racism isn't just a black and white problem. It's brought bloodbaths to about every nation on earth at one time or another.

Brother, remember the time that white college girl came into the restaurantthe one who wanted to help the [Black] Muslims and the whites get togetherand I told her there wasn't a ghost of a chance and she went away crying? Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In many parts of the African continent I saw white students helping black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a [Black] Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie thenlike all [Black] MuslimsI was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me 12 years.

That was a bad scene, brother. The sickness and madness of those daysI'm glad to be free of them.

MalcolmX has been described as one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history. He is credited with raising the self-esteem of black Americans and reconnecting them with their African heritage. He is largely responsible for the spread of Islam in the black community in the United States. Many African Americans, especially those who lived in cities in the Northern and Western United States, felt that MalcolmX articulated their complaints concerning inequality better than did the mainstream civil rights movement. One biographer says that by giving expression to their frustration, MalcolmX "made clear the price that white America would have to pay if it did not accede to black America's legitimate demands".

In the late 1960s, increasingly radical black activists based their movements largely on MalcolmX and his teachings. The <a href="Black%20Power">Black Power</a> movement, the <a href="Black%20Arts%20Movement">Black Arts Movement</a>, and the widespread adoption of the slogan "<a href="Black%20is%20beautiful">Black is beautiful</a>" can all trace their roots to MalcolmX.

In 1963 MalcolmX began a collaboration with <a href="Alex%20Haley">Alex Haley</a> on his life story, "<a href="The%20Autobiography%20of%20Malcolm%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BX">The Autobiography of Malcolm X</a>". He told Haley, "If I'm alive when this book comes out, it will be a miracle." Haley completed and published it some months after the assassination.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest in his life among young people. <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">Hip-hop</a> groups such as <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28band%29">Public Enemy</a> adopted MalcolmX as an icon, and his image was displayed in hundreds of thousands of homes, offices, and schools, as well as on T-shirts and jackets. This wave peaked in 1992 with the release of the film "<a href="Malcolm%20X%20%281992%20film%29">MalcolmX</a>", an adaptation of "The Autobiography of Malcolm X".

In 1998 "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" named "The Autobiography of MalcolmX" one of the ten most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century. 

<a href="Denzel%20Washington">Denzel Washington</a> played the title role in the 1992 motion picture "<a href="Malcolm%20X%20%281992%20film%29">MalcolmX</a>"named one of the ten best films of the 1990s by both critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> and director <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>. Washington had previously played the part of MalcolmX in the 1981 <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> play "When the Chickens Came Home to Roost". Other portrayals include:

The <a href="Malcolm%20X%20House%20Site">house</a> that once stood at 3448 Pinkney Street in <a href="North%20Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">North Omaha</a>, Nebraska, was the first home of Malcolm Little with his birth family. The house was torn down in 1965 by new owners who did not know of its connection with MalcolmX. The site was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1984.

In Lansing, Michigan, a Michigan Historical Marker was erected in 1975 on Malcolm Little's childhood home. The city is also home to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz Academy, a public <a href="charter%20school">charter school</a> with an <a href="Afrocentrism">Afrocentric</a> focus. The school is located in the building where Little attended elementary school.

In cities around the world, MalcolmX's birthday (May19) is commemorated as <a href="Malcolm%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BX%20Day">Malcolm X Day</a>. The first known celebration of MalcolmX Day took place in Washington, D.C., in 1971. The city of <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley</a>, California, has recognized MalcolmX's birthday as a citywide holiday since 1979.

Many cities have renamed streets after MalcolmX. In 1987, New York mayor <a href="Ed%20Koch">Ed Koch</a> proclaimed <a href="Lenox%20Avenue">Lenox Avenue</a> in Harlem to be MalcolmX Boulevard. The name of Reid Avenue in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, New York, was changed to MalcolmX Boulevard in 1985. In 1997, Oakland Avenue in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, Texas, was renamed MalcolmX Boulevard. Main Street in Lansing, Michigan, was renamed MalcolmX Street in 2010. In 2016, <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, renamed the street on which the U.S. is building its new embassy after MalcolmX.

Dozens of schools have been named after MalcolmX, including <a href="Malcolm%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BX%20Shabazz%20High%20School">Malcolm X Shabazz High School</a> in <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark</a>, New Jersey, <a href="Malcolm%20Shabazz%20City%20High%20School">Malcolm Shabazz City High School</a> in <a href="Madison%2C%20Wisconsin">Madison</a>, Wisconsin, and <a href="Malcolm%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BX%20College">Malcolm X College</a> in Chicago, Illinois. <a href="Malcolm%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BX%20Liberation%20University">Malcolm X Liberation University</a>, based on the Pan-Africanist ideas of MalcolmX, was founded in 1969 in North Carolina.

In 1996, the first library named after MalcolmX was opened, the MalcolmX Branch Library and Performing Arts Center of the <a href="San%20Diego%20Public%20Library">San Diego Public Library</a> system.

The <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">U.S. Postal Service</a> issued a MalcolmX postage stamp in 1999. In 2005, <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> announced the opening of the <a href="Malcolm%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BX%20and%20Dr.%20Betty%20Shabazz%20Memorial%20and%20Educational%20Center">Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center</a>. The memorial is located in the Audubon Ballroom, where MalcolmX was assassinated. Collections of MalcolmX's papers are held by the <a href="Schomburg%20Center%20for%20Research%20in%20Black%20Culture">Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture</a> and the <a href="Robert%20W.%20Woodruff%20Library%2C%20Atlanta%20University%20Center">Robert W.

Noble gas

The noble gases (historically also the inert gases; sometimes referred to as aerogens) make up a group of <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s with similar properties; under <a href="Standard%20conditions%20for%20temperature%20and%20pressure">standard conditions</a>, they are all odorless, colorless, <a href="monatomic">monatomic</a> gases with very low <a href="chemical%20reactivity">chemical reactivity</a>. The six noble gases that occur naturally are <a href="helium">helium</a> (He), <a href="neon">neon</a> (Ne), <a href="argon">argon</a> (Ar), <a href="krypton">krypton</a> (Kr), <a href="xenon">xenon</a> (Xe), and the radioactive <a href="radon">radon</a> (Rn). These elements are all <a href="nonmetals">nonmetals</a>. <a href="Oganesson">Oganesson</a> (Og) is variously predicted to be a noble gas as well or to break the trend due to <a href="relativistic%20effects">relativistic effects</a>; its chemistry has not yet been investigated.

For the first six periods of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>, the noble gases are exactly the members of group 18. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The <a href="Inert%20gas">inertness</a> of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in incandescent lamps to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and <a href="Hypercapnia%23During%20diving">carbon dioxide (hypercapnia)</a> toxicity.

The properties of the noble gases can be well explained by modern theories of <a href="atomic%20structure">atomic structure</a>: their <a href="Electron%20shell">outer shell</a> of <a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a>s is considered to be "full", giving them little tendency to participate in chemical reactions, and it has been possible to prepare only a few hundred <a href="noble%20gas%20compound">noble gas compound</a>s. The <a href="melting%20point">melting</a> and <a href="boiling%20point">boiling point</a>s for a given noble gas are close together, differing by less than ; that is, they are liquids over only a small temperature range.

Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from <a href="air">air</a> in an <a href="air%20separation">air separation</a> unit using the methods of <a href="liquefaction%20of%20gases">liquefaction of gases</a> and <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a>. Helium is sourced from <a href="natural%20gas%20field">natural gas field</a>s that have high concentrations of helium in the <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>, using <a href="cryogenic">cryogenic</a> <a href="gas%20separation">gas separation</a> techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a> of dissolved <a href="radium">radium</a>, <a href="thorium">thorium</a>, or <a href="uranium">uranium</a> compounds. Noble gases have several important applications in industries such as lighting, welding, and space exploration. A <a href="Heliox">helium-oxygen breathing gas</a> is often used by deep-sea divers at depths of seawater over to keep the diver from experiencing <a href="Oxygen%20toxicity">oxygen toxemia</a>, the lethal effect of high-pressure oxygen, <a href="nitrogen%20narcosis">nitrogen narcosis</a>, the distracting narcotic effect of the nitrogen in air beyond this partial-pressure threshold, and <a href="Hypercapnia%23During%20diving">carbon dioxide poisoning (hypercapnia)</a>, the panic-inducing effect of excessive carbon dioxide in the bloodstream. After the risks caused by the flammability of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> became apparent, it was replaced with helium in <a href="blimp">blimp</a>s and <a href="gas%20balloon">balloons</a>.

"Noble gas" is translated from the <a href="German%20language">German</a> noun , first used in 1898 by <a href="Hugo%20Erdmann">Hugo Erdmann</a> to indicate their extremely low level of reactivity. The name makes an analogy to the term "<a href="noble%20metal">noble metal</a>s", which also have low reactivity. The noble gases have also been referred to as "<a href="inert%20gas">inert gas</a>es", but this label is deprecated as many <a href="noble%20gas%20compound">noble gas compound</a>s are now known. "Rare gases" is another term that was used, but this is also inaccurate because <a href="argon">argon</a> forms a fairly considerable part (0.94% by volume, 1.3% by mass) of the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a> due to decay of radioactive <a href="potassium-40">potassium-40</a>.
<a href="Pierre%20Janssen">Pierre Janssen</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Norman%20Lockyer">Joseph Norman Lockyer</a> discovered a new element on August 18, 1868 while looking at the <a href="chromosphere">chromosphere</a> of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, and named it <a href="helium">helium</a> after the Greek word for the Sun, (). No chemical analysis was possible at the time, but helium was later found to be a noble gas. Before them, in 1784, the English chemist and physicist <a href="Henry%20Cavendish">Henry Cavendish</a> had discovered that air contains a small proportion of a substance less reactive than <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>. A century later, in 1895, <a href="John%20Strutt%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Rayleigh">Lord Rayleigh</a> discovered that samples of nitrogen from the air were of a different <a href="density">density</a> than nitrogen resulting from <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a>s. Along with Scottish scientist <a href="William%20Ramsay">William Ramsay</a> at <a href="University%20College%2C%20London">University College, London</a>, Lord Rayleigh theorized that the nitrogen extracted from air was mixed with another gas, leading to an experiment that successfully isolated a new element, argon, from the Greek word (, "idle" or "lazy"). With this discovery, they realized an entire class of <a href="gas">gas</a>es was missing from the periodic table. During his search for argon, Ramsay also managed to isolate helium for the first time while heating <a href="cleveite">cleveite</a>, a mineral. In 1902, having accepted the evidence for the elements helium and argon, <a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a> included these noble gases as group 0 in his arrangement of the elements, which would later become the periodic table.

Ramsay continued his search for these gases using the method of <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> to separate <a href="liquid%20air">liquid air</a> into several components. In 1898, he discovered the elements <a href="krypton">krypton</a>, <a href="neon">neon</a>, and <a href="xenon">xenon</a>, and named them after the Greek words (, "hidden"), (, "new"), and (, "stranger"), respectively. <a href="Radon">Radon</a> was first identified in 1898 by <a href="Friedrich%20Ernst%20Dorn">Friedrich Ernst Dorn</a>, and was named "radium emanation", but was not considered a noble gas until 1904 when its characteristics were found to be similar to those of other noble gases. Rayleigh and Ramsay received the 1904 <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>s in Physics and in Chemistry, respectively, for their discovery of the noble gases; in the words of J. E. Cederblom, then president of the <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a>, "the discovery of an entirely new group of elements, of which no single representative had been known with any certainty, is something utterly unique in the history of chemistry, being intrinsically an advance in science of peculiar significance".

The discovery of the noble gases aided in the development of a general understanding of <a href="Atomic%20theory">atomic structure</a>. In 1895, French chemist <a href="Henri%20Moissan">Henri Moissan</a> attempted to form a reaction between <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a>, the most <a href="electronegativity">electronegative</a> element, and argon, one of the noble gases, but failed. Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century, but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure. Learning from these experiments, Danish physicist <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> proposed in 1913 that the <a href="electron">electron</a>s in atoms are arranged in <a href="electron%20shell">shells</a> surrounding the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a>, and that for all noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight electrons. In 1916, <a href="Gilbert%20N.%20Lewis">Gilbert N. Lewis</a> formulated the "<a href="octet%20rule">octet rule</a>", which concluded an octet of electrons in the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any atom; this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell.

In 1962, <a href="Neil%20Bartlett%20%28chemist%29">Neil Bartlett</a> discovered the first chemical compound of a noble gas, <a href="xenon%20hexafluoroplatinate">xenon hexafluoroplatinate</a>. Compounds of other noble gases were discovered soon after: in 1962 for radon, <a href="radon%20difluoride">radon difluoride</a> (), which was identified by radiotracer techniques and in 1963 for krypton, <a href="krypton%20difluoride">krypton difluoride</a> (). The first stable compound of argon was reported in 2000 when <a href="argon%20fluorohydride">argon fluorohydride</a> (HArF) was formed at a temperature of .

In December 1998, scientists at the <a href="Joint%20Institute%20for%20Nuclear%20Research">Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</a> working in <a href="Dubna">Dubna</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a> bombarded <a href="plutonium">plutonium (Pu)</a> with <a href="calcium">calcium (Ca)</a> to produce a single atom of element 114, <a href="flerovium">flerovium (Fl)</a>. Preliminary chemistry experiments have indicated this element may be the first <a href="superheavy%20element">superheavy element</a> to show abnormal noble-gas-like properties, even though it is a member of <a href="group%2014">group 14</a> on the periodic table. In October 2006, scientists from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> successfully created synthetically <a href="oganesson">oganesson (Og)</a>, the seventh element in group 18, by bombarding <a href="californium">californium (Cf)</a> with calcium (Ca).
The noble gases have weak <a href="interatomic%20force">interatomic force</a>, and consequently have very low <a href="melting%20point">melting</a> and <a href="boiling%20point">boiling point</a>s. They are all <a href="monatomic">monatomic</a> <a href="gas">gas</a>es under <a href="Standard%20conditions%20for%20temperature%20and%20pressure">standard conditions</a>, including the elements with larger <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a>es than many normally solid elements. Helium has several unique qualities when compared with other elements: its boiling and melting points are lower than those of any other known substance; it is the only element known to exhibit <a href="superfluidity">superfluidity</a>; it is the only element that cannot be solidified by cooling under standard conditions—a <a href="Atmospheric%20pressure">pressure</a> of must be applied at a temperature of to convert it to a solid. The noble gases up to xenon have multiple stable <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s. Radon has no <a href="stable%20isotope">stable isotope</a>s; its longest-lived isotope, Rn, has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 3.8 days and decays to form helium and <a href="polonium">polonium</a>, which ultimately decays to <a href="lead">lead</a>. Melting and boiling points generally increase going down the group.

The noble gas atoms, like atoms in most groups, increase steadily in <a href="atomic%20radius">atomic radius</a> from one <a href="period%20%28periodic%20table%29">period</a> to the next due to the increasing number of electrons. The size of the atom is related to several properties. For example, the <a href="ionization%20potential">ionization potential</a> decreases with an increasing radius because the valence electrons in the larger noble gases are farther away from the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nucleus</a> and are therefore not held as tightly together by the atom. Noble gases have the largest ionization potential among the elements of each period, which reflects the stability of their electron configuration and is related to their relative lack of chemical reactivity. Some of the heavier noble gases, however, have ionization potentials small enough to be comparable to those of other elements and <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s. It was the insight that xenon has an ionization potential similar to that of the <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> molecule that led Bartlett to attempt oxidizing xenon using <a href="platinum%20hexafluoride">platinum hexafluoride</a>, an <a href="oxidizing%20agent">oxidizing agent</a> known to be strong enough to react with oxygen. Noble gases cannot accept an electron to form stable <a href="anion">anion</a>s; that is, they have a negative <a href="electron%20affinity">electron affinity</a>.

The <a href="macroscopic">macroscopic</a> <a href="physical%20properties">physical properties</a> of the noble gases are dominated by the weak <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20forces">van der Waals forces</a> between the atoms. The attractive force increases with the size of the atom as a result of the increase in <a href="polarizability">polarizability</a> and the decrease in ionization potential. This results in systematic group trends: as one goes down group 18, the atomic radius, and with it the interatomic forces, increases, resulting in an increasing melting point, boiling point, <a href="enthalpy%20of%20vaporization">enthalpy of vaporization</a>, and <a href="solubility">solubility</a>. The increase in density is due to the increase in <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a>.

The noble gases are nearly <a href="ideal%20gas">ideal gas</a>es under standard conditions, but their deviations from the <a href="ideal%20gas%20law">ideal gas law</a> provided important clues for the study of <a href="intermolecular%20interactions">intermolecular interactions</a>. The <a href="Lennard-Jones%20potential">Lennard-Jones potential</a>, often used to model intermolecular interactions, was deduced in 1924 by <a href="John%20Lennard-Jones">John Lennard-Jones</a> from experimental data on argon before the development of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> provided the tools for understanding intermolecular forces from <a href="first%20principles">first principles</a>. The theoretical analysis of these interactions became tractable because the noble gases are monatomic and the atoms spherical, which means that the interaction between the atoms is independent of direction, or <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a>.

The noble gases are colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonflammable under standard conditions. They were once labeled "group 0" in the periodic table because it was believed they had a <a href="valence%20%28chemistry%29">valence</a> of zero, meaning their <a href="atom">atom</a>s cannot combine with those of other elements to form <a href="chemical%20compound">compounds</a>. However, it was later discovered some do indeed form compounds, causing this label to fall into disuse.

Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its <a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a>, especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior:

The noble gases have full valence <a href="electron%20shells">electron shells</a>. <a href="Valence%20electron">Valence electron</a>s are the outermost <a href="electron">electron</a>s of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>ing. Atoms with full valence electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. However, heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by <a href="electromagnetic%20force">electromagnetic force</a> than lighter noble gases such as helium, making it easier to remove outer electrons from heavy noble gases.

As a result of a full shell, the noble gases can be used in conjunction with the <a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a> notation to form the "noble gas notation". To do this, the nearest noble gas that precedes the element in question is written first, and then the electron configuration is continued from that point forward. For example, the electron notation of
<a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> is 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p, while the noble gas notation is [Ne] 3s 3p. This more compact notation makes it easier to identify elements, and is shorter than writing out the full notation of <a href="atomic%20orbital">atomic orbital</a>s.

The noble gases show extremely low chemical <a href="reactivity%20%28chemistry%29">reactivity</a>; consequently, only a few hundred <a href="noble%20gas%20compound">noble gas compound</a>s have been formed. Neutral <a href="chemical%20compound">compounds</a> in which helium and neon are involved in <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>s have not been formed (although there is some theoretical evidence for a few helium compounds), while xenon, krypton, and argon have shown only minor reactivity. The reactivity follows the order Ne < He < Ar < Kr < Xe < Rn.

In 1933, <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> predicted that the heavier noble gases could form compounds with fluorine and oxygen. He predicted the existence of krypton hexafluoride () and <a href="xenon%20hexafluoride">xenon hexafluoride</a> (), speculated that might exist as an unstable compound, and suggested that <a href="xenic%20acid">xenic acid</a> could form <a href="perxenate">perxenate</a> salts. These predictions were shown to be generally accurate, except that is now thought to be both <a href="thermodynamic%20stability">thermodynamically</a> and <a href="kinetic%20theory%20of%20gases">kinetically</a> unstable.

Xenon compounds are the most numerous of the noble gas compounds that have been formed. Most of them have the xenon atom in the <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> of +2, +4, +6, or +8 bonded to highly <a href="electronegative">electronegative</a> atoms such as fluorine or oxygen, as in <a href="xenon%20difluoride">xenon difluoride</a> (), <a href="xenon%20tetrafluoride">xenon tetrafluoride</a> (), <a href="xenon%20hexafluoride">xenon hexafluoride</a> (), <a href="xenon%20tetroxide">xenon tetroxide</a> (), and sodium perxenate (). Xenon reacts with fluorine to form numerous xenon fluorides according to the following equations:

Some of these compounds have found use in <a href="chemical%20synthesis">chemical synthesis</a> as <a href="oxidizing%20agent">oxidizing agent</a>s; , in particular, is commercially available and can be used as a <a href="fluorination">fluorinating</a> agent. As of 2007, about five hundred compounds of xenon bonded to other elements have been identified, including organoxenon compounds (containing xenon bonded to carbon), and xenon bonded to nitrogen, chlorine, gold, mercury, and xenon itself. Compounds of xenon bound to boron, hydrogen, bromine, iodine, beryllium, sulphur, titanium, copper, and silver have also been observed but only at low temperatures in noble gas <a href="matrix%20isolation">matrices</a>, or in supersonic noble gas jets.

In theory, radon is more reactive than xenon, and therefore should form chemical bonds more easily than xenon does. However, due to the high radioactivity and short half-life of <a href="isotopes%20of%20radon">radon isotopes</a>, only a few <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a>s and <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s of radon have been formed in practice.

Krypton is less reactive than xenon, but several compounds have been reported with krypton in the <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> of +2. <a href="Krypton%20difluoride">Krypton difluoride</a> is the most notable and easily characterized. Under extreme conditions, krypton reacts with fluorine to form KrF according to the following equation:

Compounds in which krypton forms a single bond to nitrogen and oxygen have also been characterized, but are only stable below and respectively.

Krypton atoms chemically bound to other nonmetals (hydrogen, chlorine, carbon) as well as some late <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>s (copper, silver, gold) have also been observed, but only either at low temperatures in noble gas matrices, or in supersonic noble gas jets. Similar conditions were used to obtain the first few compounds of argon in 2000, such as <a href="argon%20fluorohydride">argon fluorohydride</a> (HArF), and some bound to the late transition metals copper, silver, and gold. As of 2007, no stable neutral molecules involving covalently bound helium or neon are known.

The noble gases—including helium—can form stable <a href="molecular%20ion">molecular ion</a>s in the gas phase. The simplest is the <a href="Helium%20hydride%20ion">helium hydride molecular ion</a>, HeH, discovered in 1925. Because it is composed of the two most abundant elements in the universe, hydrogen and helium, it is believed to occur naturally in the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>, although it has not been detected yet. In addition to these ions, there are many known neutral <a href="excimer">excimer</a>s of the noble gases. These are compounds such as ArF and KrF that are stable only when in an <a href="Excited%20state">excited electronic state</a>; some of them find application in <a href="excimer%20laser">excimer laser</a>s.

In addition to the compounds where a noble gas atom is involved in a <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent bond</a>, noble gases also form <a href="non-covalent">non-covalent</a> compounds. The <a href="clathrate">clathrate</a>s, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of <a href="crystal%20lattice">crystal lattice</a>s of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with <a href="hydroquinone">hydroquinone</a>, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently <a href="Polarizability">polarizable</a> to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.

Noble gases can form <a href="Endohedral%20fullerenes%23Non-metal%20doped%20fullerenes">endohedral fullerene</a> compounds, in which the noble gas atom is trapped inside a <a href="fullerene">fullerene</a> molecule. In 1993, it was discovered that when , a spherical molecule consisting of 60 <a href="carbon">carbon</a> atoms, is exposed to noble gases at high pressure, <a href="Complex%20%28chemistry%29">complex</a>es such as can be formed (the "@" notation indicates He is contained inside but not covalently bound to it). As of 2008, endohedral complexes with helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon have been obtained. These compounds have found use in the study of the structure and reactivity of fullerenes by means of the <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> of the noble gas atom.
Noble gas compounds such as <a href="xenon%20difluoride">xenon difluoride</a> () are considered to be <a href="hypervalent">hypervalent</a> because they violate the <a href="octet%20rule">octet rule</a>. Bonding in such compounds can be explained using a <a href="three-center%20four-electron%20bond">three-center four-electron bond</a> model. This model, first proposed in 1951, considers bonding of three collinear atoms. For example, bonding in is described by a set of three <a href="molecular%20orbital">molecular orbital</a>s (MOs) derived from <a href="p-orbital">p-orbital</a>s on each atom. Bonding results from the combination of a filled p-orbital from Xe with one half-filled p-orbital from each <a href="fluorine">F</a> atom, resulting in a filled bonding orbital, a filled non-bonding orbital, and an empty <a href="antibonding">antibonding</a> orbital. The <a href="highest%20occupied%20molecular%20orbital">highest occupied molecular orbital</a> is localized on the two terminal atoms. This represents a localization of charge that is facilitated by the high electronegativity of fluorine.

The chemistries of the heavier noble gases, krypton and xenon, are well established. The chemistry of the lighter ones, argon and helium, is still at an early stage, while a neon compound is yet to be identified.

The abundances of the noble gases in the universe decrease as their <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>s increase. Helium is the most common element in the <a href="universe">universe</a> after hydrogen, with a mass fraction of about 24%. Most of the helium in the universe was formed during <a href="Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>, but the amount of helium is steadily increasing due to the fusion of hydrogen in <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a> (and, to a very slight degree, the <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> of heavy elements). Abundances on Earth follow different trends; for example, helium is only the third most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere. The reason is that there is no <a href="primordial%20element">primordial</a> helium in the atmosphere; due to the small mass of the atom, helium cannot be retained by the Earth's <a href="gravitational%20field">gravitational field</a>. Helium on Earth comes from the <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> of heavy elements such as <a href="uranium">uranium</a> and <a href="thorium">thorium</a> found in the Earth's <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29">crust</a>, and tends to accumulate in <a href="Natural%20gas%20field">natural gas deposit</a>s. The abundance of argon, on the other hand, is increased as a result of the <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> of <a href="potassium-40">potassium-40</a>, also found in the Earth's crust, to form <a href="argon-40">argon-40</a>, which is the most abundant isotope of argon on Earth despite being relatively rare in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>. This process is the basis for the <a href="potassium-argon%20dating">potassium-argon dating</a> method. Xenon has an unexpectedly low abundance in the atmosphere, in what has been called the "missing xenon problem"; one theory is that the missing xenon may be trapped in minerals inside the Earth's crust. After the discovery of <a href="xenon%20dioxide">xenon dioxide</a>, research showed that Xe can substitute for Si in <a href="quartz">quartz</a>. Radon is formed in the <a href="lithosphere">lithosphere</a> by the <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> of radium. It can seep into buildings through cracks in their foundation and accumulate in areas that are not well ventilated. Due to its high radioactivity, radon presents a significant health hazard; it is implicated in an estimated 21,000 <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> deaths per year in the United States alone.

For large-scale use, helium is extracted by <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> from natural gas, which can contain up to 7% helium.

Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are obtained from air using the methods of <a href="liquefaction%20of%20gases">liquefaction of gases</a>, to convert elements to a liquid state, and <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a>, to separate mixtures into component parts. Helium is typically produced by separating it from <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>, and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds. The prices of the noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance, with argon being the cheapest and xenon the most expensive. As an example, the adjacent table lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas.

Noble gases have very low boiling and melting points, which makes them useful as <a href="cryogenic">cryogenic</a> <a href="refrigerant">refrigerant</a>s. In particular, <a href="liquid%20helium">liquid helium</a>, which boils at , is used for <a href="superconducting%20magnet">superconducting magnet</a>s, such as those needed in <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">nuclear magnetic resonance imaging</a> and <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a>. Liquid neon, although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium, also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40 times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.
Helium is used as a component of <a href="breathing%20gases">breathing gases</a> to replace nitrogen, due its low <a href="solubility">solubility</a> in fluids, especially in <a href="lipids">lipids</a>. Gases are absorbed by the <a href="blood">blood</a> and <a href="body%20tissue">body tissue</a>s when under pressure like in <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a>, which causes an <a href="anesthetic">anesthetic</a> effect known as <a href="nitrogen%20narcosis">nitrogen narcosis</a>. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into <a href="cell%20membranes">cell membranes</a>, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in <a href="Trimix%20%28breathing%20gas%29">trimix</a> or <a href="heliox">heliox</a>, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as <a href="Decompression%20sickness%23Mechanism">decompression sickness</a>, or "the bends". The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a <a href="drysuit">drysuit</a> inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.

Since the <a href="Hindenburg%20disaster">"Hindenburg" disaster</a> in 1937, helium has replaced hydrogen as a <a href="lifting%20gas">lifting gas</a> in <a href="blimp">blimp</a>s and <a href="balloon">balloon</a>s due to its lightness and incombustibility, despite an 8.6% decrease in buoyancy.
In many applications, the noble gases are used to provide an inert atmosphere. Argon is used in the synthesis of <a href="air%20sensitive">air-sensitive compounds</a> that are sensitive to nitrogen. Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds, such as <a href="reactive%20intermediate">reactive intermediate</a>s, by trapping them in an inert <a href="matrix%20isolation">matrix</a> at very low temperatures. Helium is used as the carrier medium in <a href="gas%20chromatography">gas chromatography</a>, as a filler gas for <a href="thermometers">thermometers</a>, and in devices for measuring radiation, such as the <a href="Geiger%20counter">Geiger counter</a> and the <a href="bubble%20chamber">bubble chamber</a>. Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield <a href="welding%20arc">welding arc</a>s and the surrounding <a href="base%20metal">base metal</a> from the atmosphere during welding and cutting, as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for the semiconductor industry.

Noble gases are commonly used in <a href="lighting">lighting</a> because of their lack of chemical reactivity. Argon, mixed with nitrogen, is used as a filler gas for <a href="incandescent%20light%20bulb">incandescent light bulb</a>s. Krypton is used in high-performance light bulbs, which have higher <a href="color%20temperature">color temperature</a>s and greater efficiency, because it reduces the rate of evaporation of the filament more than argon; <a href="halogen%20lamps">halogen lamps</a>, in particular, use krypton mixed with small amounts of compounds of <a href="iodine">iodine</a> or <a href="bromine">bromine</a>. The noble gases glow in distinctive colors when used inside <a href="gas-discharge%20lamp">gas-discharge lamp</a>s, such as "<a href="neon%20lighting">neon lights</a>". These lights are called after neon but often contain other gases and <a href="phosphor">phosphor</a>s, which add various hues to the orange-red color of neon. Xenon is commonly used in <a href="xenon%20arc%20lamp">xenon arc lamp</a>s, which, due to their nearly <a href="continuous%20spectrum">continuous spectrum</a> that resembles daylight, find application in film projectors and as automobile headlamps.
The noble gases are used in <a href="excimer%20laser">excimer laser</a>s, which are based on short-lived electronically excited molecules known as <a href="excimer">excimer</a>s. The excimers used for lasers may be noble gas dimers such as Ar, Kr or Xe, or more commonly, the noble gas is combined with a halogen in excimers such as ArF, KrF, XeF, or XeCl. These lasers produce <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light, which, due to its short <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> (193 <a href="nanometer">nm</a> for ArF and 248 nm for KrF), allows for high-precision imaging. Excimer lasers have many industrial, medical, and scientific applications. They are used for <a href="microlithography">microlithography</a> and <a href="microfabrication">microfabrication</a>, which are essential for <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a> manufacture, and for <a href="laser%20surgery">laser surgery</a>, including laser <a href="angioplasty">angioplasty</a> and <a href="eye%20surgery">eye surgery</a>.
Some noble gases have direct application in medicine. Helium is sometimes used to improve the ease of breathing of <a href="asthma">asthma</a> sufferers. Xenon is used as an <a href="anesthetic">anesthetic</a> because of its high solubility in lipids, which makes it more potent than the usual <a href="nitrous%20oxide">nitrous oxide</a>, and because it is readily eliminated from the body, resulting in faster recovery.

Niels Bohr

Niels Henrik David Bohr (; 7 October 1885 – 18 November 1962) was a Danish <a href="physicist">physicist</a> who made foundational contributions to understanding <a href="atomic%20structure">atomic structure</a> and <a href="old%20quantum%20theory">quantum theory</a>, for which he received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1922. Bohr was also a <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> and a promoter of scientific research.

Bohr developed the <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> of the <a href="atom">atom</a>, in which he proposed that energy levels of <a href="electron">electron</a>s are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a> but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of <a href="Complementarity%20%28physics%29">complementarity</a>: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a <a href="Wave%E2%80%93particle%20duality">wave or a stream of particles</a>. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.

Bohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the <a href="University%20of%20Copenhagen">University of Copenhagen</a>, now known as the <a href="Niels%20Bohr%20Institute">Niels Bohr Institute</a>, which opened in 1920. Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including <a href="Hans%20Kramers">Hans Kramers</a>, <a href="Oskar%20Klein">Oskar Klein</a>, <a href="George%20de%20Hevesy">George de Hevesy</a>, and <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>. He predicted the existence of a new <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a>-like element, which was named <a href="hafnium">hafnium</a>, after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Later, the element <a href="bohrium">bohrium</a> was named after him.

During the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>. After <a href="German%20invasion%20of%20Denmark%20%281940%29">Denmark was occupied by the Germans</a>, he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the <a href="German%20nuclear%20weapon%20project">German nuclear weapon project</a>. In September 1943, word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. He was involved with the establishment of <a href="CERN">CERN</a> and the <a href="Ris%C3%B8%20DTU%20National%20Laboratory%20for%20Sustainable%20Energy">Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission</a> and became the first chairman of the <a href="Nordic%20Institute%20for%20Theoretical%20Physics">Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics</a> in 1957.

Bohr was born in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, Denmark, on 7 October 1885, the second of three children of <a href="Christian%20Bohr">Christian Bohr</a>, a professor of <a href="physiology">physiology</a> at the University of Copenhagen, and Ellen Adler Bohr, who came from a wealthy <a href="Danish%20Jews">Danish Jewish</a> family prominent in banking and parliamentary circles. He had an elder sister, Jenny, and a younger brother <a href="Harald%20Bohr">Harald</a>. Jenny became a teacher, while Harald became a <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> and Olympic <a href="association%20football">footballer</a> who played for the <a href="Denmark%20national%20football%20team">Danish national team</a> at the <a href="1908%20Summer%20Olympics">1908 Summer Olympics</a> in London. Bohr was a passionate footballer as well, and the two brothers played several matches for the Copenhagen-based <a href="Akademisk%20Boldklub">Akademisk Boldklub</a> (Academic Football Club), with Bohr as <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a>.
Bohr was educated at Gammelholm Latin School, starting when he was seven. In 1903, Bohr enrolled as an undergraduate at <a href="Copenhagen%20University">Copenhagen University</a>. His major was physics, which he studied under Professor <a href="Christian%20Christiansen">Christian Christiansen</a>, the university's only professor of physics at that time. He also studied astronomy and mathematics under Professor <a href="Thorvald%20Thiele">Thorvald Thiele</a>, and philosophy under Professor <a href="Harald%20H%C3%B8ffding">Harald Høffding</a>, a friend of his father.

In 1905, a gold medal competition was sponsored by the <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20and%20Letters">Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters</a> to investigate a method for measuring the <a href="surface%20tension">surface tension</a> of liquids that had been proposed by <a href="John%20Strutt%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Rayleigh">Lord Rayleigh</a> in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to <a href="glass%20blowing">make his own glassware</a>, creating test tubes with the required <a href="ellipse">elliptical</a> cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a> of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> in London for publication in the "<a href="Philosophical%20Transactions%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</a>".

Harald became the first of the two Bohr brothers to earn a <a href="master%27s%20degree">master's degree</a>, which he earned for mathematics in April 1909. Niels took another nine months to earn his. Students had to submit a thesis on a subject assigned by their supervisor. Bohr's supervisor was Christiansen, and the topic he chose was the electron theory of metals. Bohr subsequently elaborated his master's thesis into his much-larger <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> (dr. phil.) thesis. He surveyed the literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by <a href="Paul%20Drude">Paul Drude</a> and elaborated by <a href="Hendrik%20Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a>, in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr extended Lorentz's model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the <a href="Hall%20effect">Hall effect</a>, and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The thesis was accepted in April 1911, and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May. Harald had received his doctorate the previous year. Bohr's thesis was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time. In 1921, the Dutch physicist <a href="Hendrika%20Johanna%20van%20Leeuwen">Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen</a> would independently derive a theorem from Bohr's thesis that is today known as the <a href="Bohr%E2%80%93van%20Leeuwen%20theorem">Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem</a>.
In 1910, Bohr met Margrethe Nørlund, the sister of the mathematician <a href="Niels%20Erik%20N%C3%B8rlund">Niels Erik Nørlund</a>. Bohr resigned his membership in the <a href="Church%20of%20Denmark">Church of Denmark</a> on 16 April 1912, and he and Margrethe were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall in <a href="Slagelse">Slagelse</a> on 1 August. Years later, his brother Harald similarly left the church before getting married. Bohr and Margrethe had six sons. The oldest, Christian, died in a boating accident in 1934, and another, Harald, died from childhood meningitis. <a href="Aage%20Bohr">Aage Bohr</a> became a successful physicist, and in 1975 was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics, like his father. became a physician; , a chemical engineer; and <a href="Ernest%20Bohr">Ernest</a>, a lawyer. Like his uncle Harald, Ernest Bohr became an Olympic athlete, playing <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a> for Denmark at the <a href="1948%20Summer%20Olympics">1948 Summer Olympics</a> in London.

In September 1911, Bohr, supported by a fellowship from the <a href="Carlsberg%20Foundation">Carlsberg Foundation</a>, travelled to England. At the time, it was where most of the theoretical work on the structure of atoms and molecules was being done. He met <a href="J.%20J.%20Thomson">J. J. Thomson</a> of the <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a> and <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>. He attended lectures on <a href="electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a> given by <a href="James%20Jeans">James Jeans</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Larmor">Joseph Larmor</a>, and did some research on <a href="cathode%20ray">cathode ray</a>s, but failed to impress Thomson. He had more success with younger physicists like the Australian <a href="William%20Lawrence%20Bragg">William Lawrence Bragg</a>, and New Zealand's <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>, whose 1911 small central nucleus <a href="Rutherford%20model">Rutherford model</a> of the <a href="atom">atom</a> had challenged Thomson's 1904 <a href="plum%20pudding%20model">plum pudding model</a>. Bohr received an invitation from Rutherford to conduct post-doctoral work at <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Manchester">Victoria University of Manchester</a>, where Bohr met <a href="George%20de%20Hevesy">George de Hevesy</a> and <a href="Charles%20Galton%20Darwin">Charles Galton Darwin</a> (whom Bohr referred to as "the grandson of the <a href="Charles%20Darwin">real Darwin</a>").

Bohr returned to Denmark in July 1912 for his wedding, and travelled around England and Scotland on his honeymoon. On his return, he became a "<a href="privatdocent">privatdocent</a>" at the University of Copenhagen, giving lectures on <a href="thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>. <a href="Martin%20Knudsen">Martin Knudsen</a> put Bohr's name forward for a "<a href="docent">docent</a>", which was approved in July 1913, and Bohr then began teaching medical students. His three papers, which later became famous as "the trilogy", were published in "<a href="Philosophical%20Magazine">Philosophical Magazine</a>" in July, September and November of that year. He adapted Rutherford's nuclear structure to <a href="Max%20Planck">Max Planck</a>'s quantum theory and so created his <a href="Bohr%20model">Bohr model</a> of the atom.

Planetary models of atoms were not new, but Bohr's treatment was. Taking the 1912 paper by Darwin on the role of electrons in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point, he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in <a href="orbit">orbit</a>s around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of each element being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms. He introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a <a href="quantum">quantum</a> of discrete energy. This became a basis for what is now known as the <a href="old%20quantum%20theory">old quantum theory</a>.

In 1885, <a href="Johann%20Balmer">Johann Balmer</a> had come up with his <a href="Balmer%20series">Balmer series</a> to describe the visible <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a>s of a <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> atom:
where λ is the wavelength of the absorbed or emitted light and "R" is the <a href="Rydberg%20constant">Rydberg constant</a>. Balmer's formula was corroborated by the discovery of additional spectral lines, but for thirty years, no one could explain why it worked. In the first paper of his trilogy, Bohr was able to derive it from his model:
where "m" is the electron's mass, "e" is its charge, "h" is <a href="Planck%27s%20constant">Planck's constant</a> and "Z" is the atom's <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> (1 for hydrogen).

The model's first hurdle was the <a href="Pickering%20series">Pickering series</a>, lines which did not fit Balmer's formula. When challenged on this by <a href="Alfred%20Fowler">Alfred Fowler</a>, Bohr replied that they were caused by <a href="ionization">ionised</a> <a href="helium">helium</a>, helium atoms with only one electron. The Bohr model was found to work for such ions. Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and <a href="Hendrik%20Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a>, did not like the trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford, <a href="David%20Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>, <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>, <a href="Max%20Born">Max Born</a> and <a href="Arnold%20Sommerfeld">Arnold Sommerfeld</a> saw it as a breakthrough. The trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments. Today, the Bohr model of the atom has been superseded, but is still the best known model of the atom, as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.

Bohr did not enjoy teaching medical students. He decided to return to Manchester, where Rutherford had offered him a job as a <a href="reader%20%28academic%20rank%29">reader</a> in place of Darwin, whose tenure had expired. Bohr accepted. He took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen, which he started by taking a holiday in <a href="South%20Tyrol">Tyrol</a> with his brother Harald and aunt Hanna Adler. There, he visited the <a href="University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">University of Göttingen</a> and the <a href="Ludwig%20Maximilian%20University%20of%20Munich">Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich</a>, where he met Sommerfeld and conducted seminars on the trilogy. The First World War broke out while they were in Tyrol, greatly complicating the trip back to Denmark and Bohr's subsequent voyage with Margrethe to England, where he arrived in October 1914. They stayed until July 1916, by which time he had been appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, a position created especially for him. His docentship was abolished at the same time, so he still had to teach physics to medical students. New professors were formally introduced to King <a href="Christian%20X">Christian X</a>, who expressed his delight at meeting such a famous football player.

In April 1917, Bohr began a campaign to establish an Institute of Theoretical Physics. He gained the support of the Danish government and the Carlsberg Foundation, and sizeable contributions were also made by industry and private donors, many of them Jewish. Legislation establishing the Institute was passed in November 1918. Now known as the <a href="Niels%20Bohr%20Institute">Niels Bohr Institute</a>, it opened on 3 March 1921, with Bohr as its director. His family moved into an apartment on the first floor. Bohr's institute served as a focal point for researchers into <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> and related subjects in the 1920s and 1930s, when most of the world's best known theoretical physicists spent some time in his company. Early arrivals included <a href="Hans%20Kramers">Hans Kramers</a> from the Netherlands, <a href="Oskar%20Klein">Oskar Klein</a> from Sweden, George de Hevesy from Hungary, <a href="Wojciech%20Rubinowicz">Wojciech Rubinowicz</a> from Poland and <a href="Svein%20Rosseland">Svein Rosseland</a> from Norway. Bohr became widely appreciated as their congenial host and eminent colleague. Klein and Rosseland produced the Institute's first publication even before it opened.
The Bohr model worked well for hydrogen, but could not explain more complex elements. By 1919, Bohr was moving away from the idea that electrons orbited the nucleus and developed <a href="heuristic">heuristic</a>s to describe them. The <a href="rare-earth%20element">rare-earth element</a>s posed a particular classification problem for chemists, because they were so chemically similar. An important development came in 1924 with <a href="Wolfgang%20Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a>'s discovery of the <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli exclusion principle</a>, which put Bohr's models on a firm theoretical footing. Bohr was then able to declare that the as-yet-undiscovered element 72 was not a rare-earth element, but an element with chemical properties similar to those of <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a>. He was immediately challenged by the French chemist <a href="Georges%20Urbain">Georges Urbain</a>, who claimed to have discovered a rare-earth element 72, which he called "celtium". At the Institute in Copenhagen, <a href="Dirk%20Coster">Dirk Coster</a> and George de Hevesy took up the challenge of proving Bohr right and Urbain wrong. Starting with a clear idea of the chemical properties of the unknown element greatly simplified the search process. They went through samples from Copenhagen's Museum of Mineralogy looking for a zirconium-like element and soon found it. The element, which they named <a href="hafnium">hafnium</a> ("Hafnia" being the Latin name for Copenhagen) turned out to be more common than gold.

In 1922, Bohr was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> "for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them". The award thus recognised both the Trilogy and his early leading work in the emerging field of quantum mechanics. For his Nobel lecture, Bohr gave his audience a comprehensive survey of what was then known about the structure of the atom, including the <a href="correspondence%20principle">correspondence principle</a>, which he had formulated. This states that the behaviour of systems described by quantum theory reproduces <a href="classical%20physics">classical physics</a> in the limit of large <a href="quantum%20number">quantum number</a>s.

The discovery of <a href="Compton%20scattering">Compton scattering</a> by <a href="Arthur%20Holly%20Compton">Arthur Holly Compton</a> in 1923 convinced most physicists that light was composed of <a href="photon">photon</a>s, and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons. In 1924, Bohr, Kramers and <a href="John%20C.%20Slater">John C. Slater</a>, an American physicist working at the Institute in Copenhagen, proposed the <a href="Bohr%E2%80%93Kramers%E2%80%93Slater%20theory">Bohr–Kramers–Slater theory</a> (BKS). It was more a programme than a full physical theory, as the ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively. BKS theory became the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation on the basis of the old quantum theory, in which quantum phenomena were treated by imposing quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field.

Modelling atomic behaviour under incident electromagnetic radiation using "virtual oscillators" at the absorption and emission frequencies, rather than the (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born, <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a> and Kramers to explore different mathematical models. They led to the development of <a href="matrix%20mechanics">matrix mechanics</a>, the first form of modern <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory. The most provocative element of BKS – that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically – was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by <a href="Walther%20Bothe">Walther Bothe</a> and <a href="Hans%20Geiger">Hans Geiger</a>. In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that "there is nothing else to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible".

The introduction of <a href="Spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a> by <a href="George%20Uhlenbeck">George Uhlenbeck</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Goudsmit">Samuel Goudsmit</a> in November 1925 was a milestone. The next month, Bohr travelled to <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a> to attend celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Hendrick Lorentz receiving his doctorate. When his train stopped in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, he was met by Wolfgang Pauli and <a href="Otto%20Stern">Otto Stern</a>, who asked for his opinion of the spin theory. Bohr pointed out that he had concerns about the interaction between electrons and magnetic fields. When he arrived in Leiden, <a href="Paul%20Ehrenfest">Paul Ehrenfest</a> and Albert Einstein informed Bohr that Einstein had resolved this problem using <a href="Theory%20of%20relativity">relativity</a>. Bohr then had Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit incorporate this into their paper. Thus, when he met Werner Heisenberg and <a href="Pascual%20Jordan">Pascual Jordan</a> in <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a> on the way back, he had become, in his own words, "a prophet of the electron magnet gospel".

Heisenberg first came to Copenhagen in 1924, then returned to Göttingen in June 1925, shortly thereafter developing the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. When he showed his results to Max Born in Göttingen, Born realised that they could best be expressed using <a href="Matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrices</a>. This work attracted the attention of the British physicist <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>, who came to Copenhagen for six months in September 1926. Austrian physicist <a href="Erwin%20Schr%C3%B6dinger">Erwin Schrödinger</a> also visited in 1926. His attempt at explaining quantum physics in classical terms using wave mechanics impressed Bohr, who believed it contributed "so much to mathematical clarity and simplicity that it represents a gigantic advance over all previous forms of quantum mechanics".

When Kramers left the Institute in 1926 to take up a chair as professor of theoretical physics at the <a href="Utrecht%20University">Utrecht University</a>, Bohr arranged for Heisenberg to return and take Kramers's place as a "<a href="lektor">lektor</a>" at the University of Copenhagen. Heisenberg worked in Copenhagen as a university lecturer and assistant to Bohr from 1926 to 1927.

Bohr became convinced that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the <a href="de%20Broglie%20hypothesis">de Broglie hypothesis</a> that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of <a href="Complementarity%20%28physics%29">complementarity</a>: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He felt that it was not fully understood by professional philosophers.

In Copenhagen in 1927 Heisenberg developed his <a href="uncertainty%20principle">uncertainty principle</a>, which Bohr embraced. In a paper he presented at the <a href="Volta%20Conference">Volta Conference</a> at <a href="Como">Como</a> in September 1927, he demonstrated that the uncertainty principle could be derived from classical arguments, without quantum terminology or matrices. Einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed. Philosophical issues that arose from the novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion. Einstein and Bohr had <a href="Bohr%E2%80%93Einstein%20debates">good-natured arguments</a> over such issues throughout their lives.

In 1914, <a href="Carl%20Jacobsen">Carl Jacobsen</a>, the heir to <a href="Carlsberg%20Group">Carlsberg breweries</a>, bequeathed his mansion to be used for life by the Dane who had made the most prominent contribution to science, literature or the arts, as an honorary residence (). Harald Høffding had been the first occupant, and upon his death in July 1931, the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters gave Bohr occupancy. He and his family moved there in 1932. He was elected president of the Academy on 17 March 1939.

By 1929, the phenomenon of <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> prompted Bohr to again suggest that the <a href="law%20of%20conservation%20of%20energy">law of conservation of energy</a> be abandoned, but <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>'s hypothetical <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a> and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the <a href="neutron">neutron</a> provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr to create a new theory of the <a href="compound%20nucleus">compound nucleus</a> in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.

The discovery of <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> by <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> in December 1938 (and its theoretical explanation by <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a>) generated intense interest among physicists. Bohr brought the news to the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939. When Bohr told <a href="George%20Placzek">George Placzek</a> that this resolved all the mysteries of <a href="transuranic%20elements">transuranic elements</a>, Placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. Bohr thought about it for a few minutes and then announced to Placzek, <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Rosenfeld">Léon Rosenfeld</a> and <a href="John%20Archibald%20Wheeler">John Wheeler</a> that "I have understood everything." Based on his <a href="liquid%20drop%20model">liquid drop model</a> of the nucleus, Bohr concluded that it was the <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> isotope and not the more abundant <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. In April 1940, <a href="John%20R.%20Dunning">John R. Dunning</a> demonstrated that Bohr was correct. In the meantime, Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on "The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission".

Bohr read the 19th-century Danish <a href="Christian%20existentialist">Christian existentialist</a> philosopher, <a href="S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard">Søren Kierkegaard</a>. <a href="Richard%20Rhodes">Richard Rhodes</a> argued in "<a href="The%20Making%20of%20the%20Atomic%20Bomb">The Making of the Atomic Bomb</a>" that Bohr was influenced by Kierkegaard through Høffding. In 1909, Bohr sent his brother Kierkegaard's "<a href="Stages%20on%20Life%27s%20Way">Stages on Life's Way</a>" as a birthday gift. In the enclosed letter, Bohr wrote, "It is the only thing I have to send home; but I do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything better ... I even think it is one of the most delightful things I have ever read." Bohr enjoyed Kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with <a href="Philosophy%20of%20S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard">Kierkegaard's philosophy</a>. Some of Bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from Kierkegaard's advocacy of Christianity, while Bohr was an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>.

There has been some dispute over the extent to which Kierkegaard influenced Bohr's philosophy and science. <a href="David%20Favrholdt">David Favrholdt</a> argued that Kierkegaard had minimal influence over Bohr's work, taking Bohr's statement about disagreeing with Kierkegaard at face value, while Jan Faye argued that one can disagree with the content of a theory while accepting its general premises and structure.

The rise of <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a> in Germany prompted many scholars to flee their countries, either because they were Jewish or because they were political opponents of the Nazi regime. In 1933, the <a href="Rockefeller%20Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a> created a fund to help support refugee academics, and Bohr discussed this programme with the President of the Rockefeller Foundation, <a href="Max%20Mason">Max Mason</a>, in May 1933 during a visit to the United States. Bohr offered the refugees temporary jobs at the Institute, provided them with financial support, arranged for them to be awarded fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation, and ultimately found them places at institutions around the world. Those that he helped included <a href="Guido%20Beck">Guido Beck</a>, <a href="Felix%20Bloch">Felix Bloch</a>, <a href="James%20Franck">James Franck</a>, <a href="George%20de%20Hevesy">George de Hevesy</a>, <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a>, <a href="Hilde%20Levi">Hilde Levi</a>, <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a>, George Placzek, <a href="Eugene%20Rabinowitch">Eugene Rabinowitch</a>, <a href="Stefan%20Rozental">Stefan Rozental</a>, Erich Ernst Schneider, <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>, <a href="Arthur%20R.%20von%20Hippel">Arthur von Hippel</a> and <a href="Victor%20Weisskopf">Victor Weisskopf</a>.

In April 1940, early in the Second World War, <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> <a href="Occupation%20of%20Denmark">invaded and occupied Denmark</a>. To prevent the Germans from discovering <a href="Max%20von%20Laue">Max von Laue</a>'s and James Franck's gold Nobel medals, Bohr had de Hevesy dissolve them in <a href="aqua%20regia">aqua regia</a>. In this form, they were stored on a shelf at the Institute until after the war, when the gold was precipitated and the medals re-struck by the Nobel Foundation. Bohr kept the Institute running, but all the foreign scholars departed.

Bohr was aware of the possibility of using uranium-235 to construct an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>, referring to it in lectures in Britain and Denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. In September 1941, Heisenberg, who had become head of the <a href="German%20nuclear%20energy%20project">German nuclear energy project</a>, visited Bohr in Copenhagen. During this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.
According to Heisenberg, he began to address nuclear energy, morality and the war, to which Bohr seems to have reacted by terminating the conversation abruptly while not giving Heisenberg hints about his own opinions. <a href="Ivan%20Supek">Ivan Supek</a>, one of Heisenberg's students and friends, claimed that the main subject of the meeting was <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20von%20Weizs%C3%A4cker">Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker</a>, who had proposed trying to persuade Bohr to mediate peace between Britain and Germany.

In 1957, Heisenberg wrote to <a href="Robert%20Jungk">Robert Jungk</a>, who was then working on the book "". Heisenberg explained that he had visited Copenhagen to communicate to Bohr the views of several German scientists, that production of a nuclear weapon was possible with great efforts, and this raised enormous responsibilities on the world's scientists on both sides. When Bohr saw Jungk's depiction in the Danish translation of the book, he drafted (but never sent) a letter to Heisenberg, stating that he never understood the purpose of Heisenberg's visit, was shocked by Heisenberg's opinion that Germany would win the war, and that atomic weapons could be decisive.

<a href="Michael%20Frayn">Michael Frayn</a>'s 1998 play "<a href="Copenhagen%20%28play%29">Copenhagen</a>" explores what might have happened at the 1941 meeting between Heisenberg and Bohr. A <a href="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="Copenhagen%20%282002%20film%29">television film version</a> of the play was first screened on 26 September 2002, with <a href="Stephen%20Rea">Stephen Rea</a> as Bohr, and <a href="Daniel%20Craig">Daniel Craig</a> as Heisenberg. The same meeting had previously been dramatised by the BBC's "<a href="Horizon%20%28BBC%20TV%20series%29">Horizon</a>" science documentary series in 1992, with <a href="Anthony%20Bate">Anthony Bate</a> as Bohr, and Philip Anthony as Heisenberg. The meeting is also dramatized in the Norwegian/Danish/British miniseries "<a href="The%20Heavy%20Water%20War">The Heavy Water War</a>".

In September 1943, word reached Bohr and his brother Harald that the Nazis considered their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, and that they were therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King <a href="Gustaf%20V%20of%20Sweden">Gustaf V of Sweden</a> to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass <a href="rescue%20of%20the%20Danish%20Jews">rescue of the Danish Jews</a> by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.
When the news of Bohr's escape reached Britain, <a href="Lord%20Cherwell">Lord Cherwell</a> sent a telegram to Bohr asking him to come to Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a> operated by the <a href="British%20Overseas%20Airways%20Corporation">British Overseas Airways Corporation</a> (BOAC). The Mosquitos were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's <a href="bomb%20bay">bomb bay</a>. During the flight, Bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did not hear the pilot's intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when the aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly Norway. He passed out from oxygen starvation and only revived when the aircraft descended to lower altitude over the North Sea. Bohr's son Aage followed his father to Britain on another flight a week later, and became his personal assistant.

Bohr was warmly received by <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> and Sir <a href="John%20Anderson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Waverley">John Anderson</a>, but for security reasons Bohr was kept out of sight. He was given an apartment at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a> and an office with the British <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> nuclear weapons development team. Bohr was astonished at the amount of progress that had been made. Chadwick arranged for Bohr to visit the United States as a Tube Alloys consultant, with Aage as his assistant. On 8 December 1943, Bohr arrived in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, where he met with the director of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, Brigadier General <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a> He visited Einstein and Pauli at the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>, and went to <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">Los Alamos</a> in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, where the nuclear weapons were being designed. For security reasons, he went under the name of "Nicholas Baker" in the United States, while Aage became "James Baker". In May 1944 the Danish resistance newspaper <a href="De%20frie%20Danske">De frie Danske</a> reported that they had learned that 'the famous son of Denmark Professor Niels Bohr' in October the previous year had fled his country via Sweden to London and from there travelled to <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> from where he could be assumed to support the war effort.

Bohr did not remain at Los Alamos, but paid a series of extended visits over the course of the next two years. <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> credited Bohr with acting "as a scientific father figure to the younger men", most notably <a href="Richard%20Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>. Bohr is quoted as saying, "They didn't need my help in making the atom bomb." Oppenheimer gave Bohr credit for an important contribution to the work on <a href="modulated%20neutron%20initiator">modulated neutron initiator</a>s. "This device remained a stubborn puzzle," Oppenheimer noted, "but in early February 1945 Niels Bohr clarified what had to be done."

Bohr recognised early that nuclear weapons would change international relations. In April 1944, he received a letter from <a href="Peter%20Kapitza">Peter Kapitza</a>, written some months before when Bohr was in Sweden, inviting him to come to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. The letter convinced Bohr that the Soviets were aware of the Anglo-American project, and would strive to catch up. He sent Kapitza a non-committal response, which he showed to the authorities in Britain before posting. Bohr met Churchill on 16 May 1944, but found that "we did not speak the same language". Churchill disagreed with the idea of openness towards the Russians to the point that he wrote in a letter: "It seems to me Bohr ought to be confined or at any rate made to see that he is very near the edge of mortal crimes."

Oppenheimer suggested that Bohr visit President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> to convince him that the Manhattan Project should be shared with the Soviets in the hope of speeding up its results. Bohr's friend, Supreme Court Justice <a href="Felix%20Frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a>, informed President Roosevelt about Bohr's opinions, and a meeting between them took place on 26 August 1944. Roosevelt suggested that Bohr return to the United Kingdom to try to win British approval. When Churchill and Roosevelt met at Hyde Park on 19 September 1944, they rejected the idea of informing the world about the project, and the aide-mémoire of their conversation contained a rider that "enquiries should be made regarding the activities of Professor Bohr and steps taken to ensure that he is responsible for no leakage of information, particularly to the Russians".

In June 1950, Bohr addressed an "Open Letter" to the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> calling for international cooperation on nuclear energy. In the 1950s, after the <a href="RDS-1">Soviet Union's first nuclear weapon test</a>, the <a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> was created along the lines of Bohr's suggestion. In 1957 he received the first ever <a href="Atoms%20for%20Peace%20Award">Atoms for Peace Award</a>.

With the war now ended, Bohr returned to Copenhagen on 25 August 1945, and was re-elected President of the Royal Danish Academy of Arts and Sciences on 21 September. At a memorial meeting of the Academy on 17 October 1947 for King <a href="Christian%20X%20of%20Denmark">Christian X</a>, who had died in April, the new king, <a href="Frederick%20IX%20of%20Denmark">Frederick IX</a>, announced that he was conferring the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Elephant">Order of the Elephant</a> on Bohr. This award was normally awarded only to royalty and heads of state, but the king said that it honoured not just Bohr personally, but Danish science. Bohr designed his own <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> which featured a <a href="taijitu">taijitu</a> (symbol of yin and yang) and a motto in , "opposites are complementary".

The Second World War demonstrated that science, and physics in particular, now required considerable financial and material resources. To avoid a <a href="brain%20drain">brain drain</a> to the United States, twelve European countries banded together to create <a href="CERN">CERN</a>, a research organisation along the lines of the national laboratories in the United States, designed to undertake <a href="Big%20Science">Big Science</a> projects beyond the resources of any one of them alone. Questions soon arose regarding the best location for the facilities. Bohr and Kramers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the ideal site. <a href="Pierre%20Auger">Pierre Auger</a>, who organised the preliminary discussions, disagreed; he felt that both Bohr and his Institute were past their prime, and that Bohr's presence would overshadow others. After a long debate, Bohr pledged his support to CERN in February 1952, and <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> was chosen as the site in October. The CERN Theory Group was based in Copenhagen until their new accommodation in Geneva was ready in 1957. Victor Weisskopf, who later became the <a href="List%20of%20Directors%20General%20of%20CERN">Director General of CERN</a>, summed up Bohr's role, saying that "there were other personalities who started and conceived the idea of <a href="CERN">CERN</a>. The enthusiasm and ideas of the other people would not have been enough, however, if a man of his stature had not supported it."

Meanwhile, Scandinavian countries formed the <a href="Nordic%20Institute%20for%20Theoretical%20Physics">Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics</a> in 1957, with Bohr as its chairman. He was also involved with the founding of the <a href="Ris%C3%B8%20DTU%20National%20Laboratory%20for%20Sustainable%20Energy">Research Establishment Risø of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission</a>, and served as its first chairman from February 1956.

Bohr died of heart failure at his home in <a href="Carlsberg%20%28district%29">Carlsberg</a> on 18 November 1962. He was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the family plot in the <a href="Assistens%20Cemetery%20%28Copenhagen%29">Assistens Cemetery</a> in the <a href="N%C3%B8rrebro">Nørrebro</a> section of Copenhagen, along with those of his parents, his brother Harald, and his son Christian. Years later, his wife's ashes were also interred there. On 7 October 1965, on what would have been his 80th birthday, the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen was officially renamed to what it had been called unofficially for many years: the Niels Bohr Institute.

Bohr received numerous honours and accolades. In addition to the Nobel Prize, he received the <a href="Hughes%20Medal">Hughes Medal</a> in 1921, the <a href="Matteucci%20Medal">Matteucci Medal</a> in 1923, the <a href="Franklin%20Medal">Franklin Medal</a> in 1926, the <a href="Copley%20Medal">Copley Medal</a> in 1938, the Order of the Elephant in 1947, the Atoms for Peace Award in 1957 and the <a href="Sonning%20Prize">Sonning Prize</a> in 1961. He became foreign member of the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1923, and of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> in 1926. The Bohr model's semicentennial was commemorated in Denmark on 21 November 1963 with a <a href="Commemorative%20stamp">postage stamp</a> depicting Bohr, the hydrogen atom and the formula for the difference of any two hydrogen energy levels: formula_3. Several other countries have also issued postage stamps depicting Bohr. In 1997, the <a href="Danish%20National%20Bank">Danish National Bank</a> began circulating the <a href="Banknotes%20of%20Denmark%2C%201997%20series">500-krone banknote</a> with the portrait of Bohr smoking a pipe. An asteroid, <a href="3948%20Bohr">3948 Bohr</a>, was named after him, as was the <a href="Bohr%20%28crater%29">Bohr lunar crater</a> and <a href="bohrium">bohrium</a>, the chemical element with atomic number 107.

Nights into Dreams

Development began after the release of "<a href="Sonic%20%26amp%3B%20Knuckles">Sonic & Knuckles</a>" in 1994, although the concept originated during the development of "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%202">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>" two years prior. Development was led by Sonic Team veterans <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a>, <a href="Naoto%20Ohshima">Naoto Ohshima</a>, and <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka%20%28game%20designer%29">Takashi Iizuka</a>. Naka began the project with the main idea revolving around flight, and Ohshima designed the character Nights to resemble an angel that could fly like a bird. Ohshima designed Nights as an <a href="androgynous">androgynous</a> character. The team conducted research on dreaming and <a href="REM%20sleep">REM sleep</a>, and was influenced by the works and theories of psychoanalysts <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a> and <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>. An analogue controller, the Saturn 3D controller, was designed alongside the game and included with some retail copies.

"Nights into Dreams" received acclaim for its graphics, gameplay, soundtrack, and atmosphere. It has appeared on several lists of the <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">greatest games of all time</a>. An abbreviated Christmas-themed version, "Christmas Nights", was released in December 1996. The game was <a href="porting">ported</a> to the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> in 2008 in Japan and a high-definition version was released worldwide for <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, and <a href="Windows">Windows</a> in 2012. A sequel, "", was released for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a> in 2007.

"Nights into Dreams" is split into seven <a href="level%20%28video%20game%29">levels</a>, referred to as "Dreams". The levels are distributed between the two teenage characters: three are unique to Claris, three to Elliot, and each play through an identical final seventh level, "Twin Seeds". Initially, only Claris' "Spring Valley" and Elliot's "Splash Garden" levels are available, and successful completion of one of these unlocks the next level in that character's path. Previously completed stages may be revisited to improve the player's <a href="high%20score">high score</a>s; a grade between A and F is given to the player upon completion, but a "C" grade (or better) in all the selected character's levels must be achieved to unlock the relevant "Twin Seeds" stage for that character. Points are accumulated depending on how fast the player completes a level, and extra points are awarded when the player flies through rings.

Each level is split up into four "Mares" set in Nightopia and a <a href="boss%20fight">boss fight</a> which takes place in Nightmare. In each level, players initially control Claris or Elliot, who immediately have their Ideyas (spherical objects that contain emotions) of hope, wisdom, intelligence and purity stolen from them by Wizeman's minions, leaving behind only their Ideya of courage. The goal of each Mare is to recover one of the stolen Ideya by collecting 20 blue chips and delivering them to the cage holding the Ideyas, which overloads and releases the orb it holds. If the player walks around the landscape for too long, they are pursued by a sentient <a href="alarm%20clock">alarm clock</a> which awakens the character and end the level if it comes into contact with the player. The majority of the gameplay centres on flying sequences, which are triggered by walking into the Ideya Palace near the start of each level so that the character merges with the imprisoned Nights. Once the flying sequence is initiated, the time limit begins.

In the flying sections, the player controls Nights' flight along a predetermined route through each Mare, resembling that of a 2D <a href="platform%20game">platformer</a>. The player has only a limited period of time available before Nights falls to the ground and transforms back into Claris or Elliot, and each collision with an enemy subtracts five seconds from the time remaining. The player's time is replenished each time they return an Ideya to the Ideya Palace. While flying, Nights can use a "Drill Dash" to travel faster, as well as defeat certain reverie enemies scattered throughout the level. Grabbing onto certain enemies causes Nights to spin around, which launches both Nights and the enemy in the direction the boost was initiated. Various acrobatic manoeuvres can be performed, including the "Paraloop", whereby flying around in a complete circle and connecting the trail of stars left in Nights' wake causes any items within the loop to be attracted towards Nights. The game features a <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo</a> system known as "Linking", whereby actions such as collecting items and flying through rings are worth more points when performed in quick succession. <a href="Power-up">Power-up</a>s may be gained by flying through several predetermined rings, indicated by a bonus barrel. The power-ups include a speed boost, point multiplier and an air pocket.

The player receives a grade based on their score at the end of each Mare, and an overall grade for the level after clearing all four Mares. Nights is then transported to Nightmare for a boss fight against one of Wizeman's "Level Two" Nightmarens. Each boss fight has a time limit, and the game ends if the player runs out of time during the battle. Upon winning the boss fight, the player is awarded a score multiplier based on how quickly the boss was defeated, which is then applied to the score earned in the Nightopia section to produce the player's final score for that Dream. The game also features a <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> mode, which allows two players to battle each other by using a <a href="split%20screen%20%28computer%20graphics%29">splitscreen</a>. One player controls Nights, whereas the other controls Reala. The winner is determined by the first player to defeat the other, which is accomplished by hitting or paralooping the other player three times.

The game features an <a href="artificial%20life">artificial life</a> system known as "A-Life", which involves entities called Nightopians and keeps track of their moods. It is possible to have them <a href="mating">mate</a> with other Nightopians, which creates hybrids known as "Superpians". The more the game is played, the more inhabitants appear, and environmental features and aesthetics change. The A-Life system features an evolving music engine, allowing <a href="tempo">tempo</a>, <a href="pitch%20%28music%29">pitch</a>, and <a href="melody">melody</a> to alter depending on the state of Nightopians within the level. The feature runs from the Sega Saturn's internal clock, which alters features in the A-Life system depending on the time.

Every night, all human dreams are played out in Nightopia and Nightmare, the two parts of the <a href="dream%20world%20%28plot%20device%29">dream world</a>. In Nightopia, distinct aspects of dreamers' personalities are represented by luminous coloured spheres known as "Ideya". The evil ruler of Nightmare, Wizeman the Wicked, is stealing this dream energy from sleeping visitors in order to gather power and take control of Nightopia and eventually the real world. To achieve this, he creates five beings called "Nightmaren": <a href="jester">jester</a>-like, flight-capable beings, which include Jackle, Clawz, Gulpo, Gillwing and Puffy as well as many minor maren. He also creates two "Level One" Nightmaren: <a href="Nights%20%28character%29">Nights</a> and Reala. However, Nights rebels against Wizeman's plans, and is punished by being imprisoned inside an Ideya palace, a container for dreamers' Ideya.

One day, Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, two teenagers from the city of Twin Seeds, go through failures. Elliot is a basketball player who enjoys a game with his friends. He is challenged by a group of older school students and suffers a humiliating defeat on the court. Claris is a talented singer and her ambition is to perform on stage. She auditions for a part in the events commemorating the centenary of the city of Twin Seeds. Standing in front of the judges, she is overcome by <a href="stage%20fright">stage fright</a> and does not perform well, which causes her to lose all hopes of getting the role. When they go to sleep that night, both Elliot and Claris suffer nightmares that replay the events. They escape into Nightopia and find that they both possess the rare Red Ideya of Courage, the only type that Wizeman cannot steal.

Once in Nightopia, they discover and release Nights, who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans; the three begin a journey to stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia and the world of Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights looking at him through a <a href="billboard">billboard</a>. Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs through the crowd and sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience, singing well. The two look at each other, and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or just a dream.

The concept for "Nights" originated during the development of "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%202">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>" in 1992, but development did not begin until after the release of "<a href="Sonic%20%26amp%3B%20Knuckles">Sonic & Knuckles</a>" in late 1994. Programming began in April 1995 and total development spanned six months. The development team consisted of staff who worked on previous "Sonic the Hedgehog" games: <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a> was lead programmer and producer, while <a href="Naoto%20Ohshima">Naoto Ohshima</a> and <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka%20%28game%20designer%29">Takashi Iizuka</a> were director and lead designer, respectively. Naka and Ohshima felt they had spent enough time with the "Sonic" franchise and were eager to work on new concepts. According to Naka, the initial development team consisted of seven people, and grew to 20 as programmers arrived.

"Sonic the Hedgehog" creator and project director Ohshima created the character of Nights based on his inspirations from travelling around Europe and western Asia. He came to the conclusion that the character should resemble an angel and fly like a bird. Naka originally intended to make "Nights into Dreams" a slow-paced game, but as development progressed the gameplay pace gradually increased, in similar vein to "Sonic" games. The initial concept envisioned the flying character in a rendered 2D sprite art, with side-scrolling features similar to "Sonic the Hedgehog". The team were hesitant to switch the game from 2D to 3D, as Naka was sceptical that appealing characters could be created with polygons, in contrast to traditional pixel sprites, which <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a>'s designers found "more expressive". According to Izuka, the game design and story took two years to finalise. The game's difficulty was designed with the intent that young and inexperienced players would be able to complete the game, while more experienced players would be compelled by the replay value.

The game was developed using <a href="Silicon%20Graphics">Silicon Graphics</a> workstations for graphical designs and Sega Saturn emulators running on <a href="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a> machines for programming. There were problems during early stages of development because of a lack of games to use as reference; the team had to redesign the Spring Valley level numerous times and build "everything from scratch". The team used the Sega Graphics Library operating system, said by many developers to make programming for the Saturn dramatically easier, only sparingly, instead creating the game almost entirely with custom libraries. Because the Sonic Team offices did not include soundproof studios, team members recorded sound effects at night. According to Naka, every phrase in the game has a meaning; for example, "abayo" is Japanese slang for "goodbye". The team felt that the global market would be less resistant to a game featuring full 3D CGI cut scenes than 2D <a href="anime">anime</a>. Norihiro Nishiyama, the designer of the in-game movies, felt that the 3D cutscenes were a good method to show the different concepts of dreaming and waking up. Naka said that the movies incorporate realism to make it more difficult for the player to disambiguate the boundary between dreams and reality.

The development took longer than expected because of the team's inexperience with Saturn hardware and uncertainty about using the full 560 megabyte space on the CD-ROM. The team initially thought that the game would consume around 100 megabytes of data, and at one point considered releasing it on two separate discs. Iizuka said that the most difficult part of development was finding a way of handling the "contradiction" of using 2D sidescroller controls in a fully 3D game. Naka limited the game's flying mechanic to "invisible 2D tracks" because early <a href="beta%20release">beta</a> testing revealed that the game was too difficult to play in full 3D. The standard Saturn gamepad was found to be insufficient to control Nights in flight, so the team developed the Saturn analog controller to be used with the game. It took about six months to develop, and the team went through a large number of ideas for alternate controllers, including one shaped like a Nights doll.

Iizuka said that the game was inspired by anime and <a href="Cirque%20du%20Soleil">Cirque du Soleil</a>'s "Mystère" theatrical performance. The development team researched dream sequences and <a href="REM%20sleep">REM sleep</a>, including the works of the psychoanalysts <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a>, <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> and Friedrich Holtz. Iizuka analysed Jung's theories of dream archetypes and spent a considerable amount of time studying dreams and theories associated with them. Naka said that the main protagonist, Nights, is reflective of Jung's analytical "<a href="Shadow%20%28psychology%29">shadow</a>" theory, whereas the two central characters, Claris and Elliot, were inspired by Jung's <a href="animus%20and%20anima">animus and anima</a>.

"Nights into Dreams" was introduced alongside an optional <a href="gamepad">gamepad</a>, the Saturn 3D controller, included with some copies of the game. It features an <a href="analogue%20stick">analogue stick</a> and analogue triggers designed specifically for the game to make movement easier. Sonic Team noted the successful twinning of the <a href="Nintendo%2064%20controller">Nintendo 64 controller</a> with "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>" (1996), and realised that the default Saturn controller was better suited to arcade games than "Nights into Dreams". During development, director <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> visited the Sonic Team studio and became the first person outside the team to play the game. Naka asked him to use an experimental version of the Saturn 3D controller, and it was jokingly referred to as the "Spielberg controller" throughout development. Because the Nights character was testing very young in <a href="focus%20group">focus group</a>s, Sega used a nighttime scene for the cover art to give the game a more mature look. The game was marketed with a budget of $10 million, which included television and print advertisements in the United States. In the US, the game was advertised with the <a href="advertising%20slogan">slogan</a> "Prepare to fly."

, or Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams..., is a Christmas-themed two-level game of "Nights into Dreams" that was released in December 1996. It was introduced in Japan as part of a Christmas Sega Saturn bundle; elsewhere it was given away with the purchase of Saturn games such as "<a href="Daytona%20USA%20Championship%20Circuit%20Edition">Daytona USA Championship Circuit Edition</a>" (1996) or issues of "Sega Saturn Magazine" and "<a href="Next%20Generation%20Magazine">Next Generation Magazine</a>". In the United Kingdom, "Christmas Nights" was not included with the "Sega Saturn Magazine" until December 1997. In a 2007 interview, Iizuka stated that "Christmas Nights" was created to increase Saturn console sales. Development began in July 1996 and took three to four months, according to Naka.

"Christmas Nights" follows Elliot and Claris during the holiday season following their adventures with Nights. Realizing that the Christmas Star is missing from the Twin Seeds <a href="Christmas%20tree">Christmas tree</a>, the pair travel to Nightopia to find it, where they reunite with Nights and retrieve the Christmas Star from Gillwing's lair.

"Christmas Nights" contains the full version of Claris' Spring Valley dream level from "Nights into Dreams", playable as both Claris and Elliot. The Saturn's internal clock changes elements according to the date and time: December activates "Christmas Nights" mode, replacing item boxes with Christmas presents, greenery with snow and gumdrops, rings with wreaths, and Ideya captures with Christmas trees; Nightopians wear <a href="Elf%20%28Christmas%29">elf</a> costumes, and the music is replaced with a rendition of "<a href="Jingle%20Bells">Jingle Bells</a>" and an <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a> version of the "Nights" theme song. During the "Winter Nights" period, the Spring Valley weather changes according to the hour. Other changes apply on New Year's Day; on <a href="April%20Fool%27s%20Day">April Fool's Day</a>, Reala replaces Nights as the playable character.

The game features several unlockable bonuses, such as being able to play the game's soundtrack, observe the status of the A-life system, experiment with the game's music mixer, <a href="time%20attack">time attack</a> one Mare, or play as Sega's mascot <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> in the minigame "Sonic the Hedgehog: Into Dreams." Sonic may only play through Spring Valley on foot, and must defeat the boss: an inflatable <a href="Dr.%20Robotnik">Dr. Robotnik</a>. The music is a remixed version of "Final Fever", the final boss battle music from the Japanese and European version of "<a href="Sonic%20CD">Sonic CD</a>" (1993). In the HD version of "Nights", the "Christmas Nights" content is playable after the game has been cleared once.

A game with the working title ""Air Nights"" was prototyped for the Saturn and began development for the Dreamcast, and in an August 1999 interview Yuji Naka confirmed that a sequel was in development; by December 2000, however, the project had been cancelled. Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel, but subsequently noted that he was interested in using "Nights into Dreams" as a licence "to reinforce Sega's identity". Aside from a <a href="handheld%20electronic%20game">handheld electronic game</a> released by <a href="Tiger%20Electronics">Tiger Electronics</a> and small <a href="minigames">minigames</a> featured in several Sega games, no full sequel was released for a Sega console.

On 1 April 2007, a sequel called "" was officially announced for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>. The game was first previewed on Portuguese publication "Maxi Consolas", after the release of short reveals from the "<a href="Official%20Nintendo%20Magazine">Official Nintendo Magazine</a>" and "Game Reactor". The sequel is a Wii exclusive, making use of the <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a>. The gameplay involves the use of various masks, and features a multiplayer mode for two players in addition to <a href="Nintendo%20Wi-Fi%20Connection">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> online functions. The game was developed by <a href="Sega%20Studio%20USA">Sega Studio USA</a>, with Iizuka, one of the designers of the original game, serving as producer. It was released in Japan and the United States in December 2007, and in Europe and Australia on 18 January 2008.

In 2010, Iizuka said that he would be interested in making a third "Nights into Dreams" game, should the management of Sega decide to commission one.

"Nights into Dreams" has an average score of 89 percent at <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>, based on an aggregate of nine reviews. In Japan, "Nights into Dreams" was the bestselling Saturn game and the 21st-bestselling game of 1996.

The graphics and flight mechanics were the most praised aspects. Tom Guise from "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" heralded the game's flight system and freedom as captivating and stated that "Nights into Dreams" is the "perfect evolution" of a "Sonic" game. Scary Larry of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" said flying using the analogue joystick "is a breeze" and that the gameplay is fun, enjoyable, and impressive. He gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for graphics and a 5 out of 5 in every other category (sound, control, and FunFactor). "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" said its "graceful acrobatic stunts" offer "a more compelling sensation of soaring than most flight simulators". "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" praised the game's analogue controller and called the levels "well-designed and graphically unrivaled", but the reviewer expressed disappointment in the limited level count compared to "Super Mario 64", and suggested that "Nights" seemed to prioritise technical achievements and Saturn selling points over gameplay with as clear a focus as "Sonic". Martin Robinson from <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> opined that the flight mechanics were a "giddy thrill". Colin Ferris from <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> praised the graphics and speed of the game as breathtaking and awe-inspiring, concluding that it offered the best qualities of the fifth-generation machines. "<a href="GameFan">GameFan</a>" praised the combination of "lush graphics, amazing music, and totally unique gameplay". "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" criticised the speed, saying that the only disappointing aspect was the way "it all rushes by so fast". However, the magazine praised the two-player mode and the innovative method of grading the player once they completed a level. "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>"s four reviewers were impressed with both the technical aspects and style of the graphics, and said the levels are great fun to explore, though they expressed disappointment that the game was not genuinely 3D and said it did not manage to surpass "Super Mario 64".

Levi Buchanan from <a href="IGN">IGN</a> believed that the console "was not built to handle "Nights"" due to the game occasionally <a href="clipping%20%28computer%20graphics%29">clipping</a> and <a href="image%20warping">warping</a>, though he admitted that the graphics were "pretty darn good". A reviewer from "<a href="Mean%20Machines%20Sega">Mean Machines Sega</a>" praised the game's vibrant colours and detailed textures, and described its animation as being "fluid as water". The reviewer also noted occasional <a href="Pop-up%20graphics">pop-in</a> and glitching during the game. Rad Automatic from the British "<a href="Sega%20Saturn%20Magazine">Sega Saturn Magazine</a>" praised the visuals and colour scheme as rich in both texture and detail, while suggesting that "Nights into Dreams" is "one of the most captivating games the Saturn has witnessed yet." "Next Generation" similarly commended the game's visuals, stating that they were "beyond a doubt" the most fluid and satisfying for any game on any system. Upon release, the Japanese "Sega Saturn Magazine" opined that the game would have a significant impact on the video game industry, particularly that in the <a href="action%20game">action game</a> genre. The reviewer also stated that the game felt better through the use of the analogue pad, in contrast to the conventional controller, and also praised the light and smooth feeling the analogue pad portrayed during gameplay.

Reviewers also praised the game's soundtrack and audio effects. Paul Davies from "Computer and Video Games" cited the game as having "the best music ever"; in the same review, Tom Guise attributed the music to creating a hypnotically magical atmosphere. Ferris stated that the music and sound effects were that of a dream world, and asserted that they were fitting for a game like "Nights into Dreams". IGN's Buchanan praised the game's soundtrack, stating that each stage's soundtrack is "quite good" and that the sound effects "fit in perfectly with the dream universe".

In "Electronic Gaming Monthly"s "Best of '96" awards, "Nights Into Dreams" was a runner-up for Flying Game of the Year (behind "<a href="Pilotwings%2064">Pilotwings 64</a>"), Nights was a runner-up for Coolest Mascot (behind <a href="Mario">Mario</a>), and the Saturn analog controller, which the magazine called the "Nights Controller", won Best Peripheral.

Since its release, "Nights into Dreams" has appeared on several <a href="list%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">best game of all time</a> lists. In a January 2000 poll by "Computer and Video Games", readers placed the game 15th on their "100 Greatest Games" list, directly behind "Super Mario 64". IGN ranked the game as the 94th best game of all time in their "Top 100 Games" list in 2007, and in 2008, Levi Buchanan ranked it fourth in his list of the top 10 Sega Saturn games. "Next Generation" ranked the game 25th in its list of the "100 Greatest Games of All Time" in their September 1996 issue (i.e. one month before they actually reviewed the game, and roughly two months before it saw release outside Japan). <a href="1UP.com">1UP</a> ranked the game third in its "Top Ten Cult Classics" list. In 2014, <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> listed "Nights into Dreams" as the best Sega Saturn game of all time, stating that the game "tapped into a new kind of platform gameplay for its era".

Sega released a <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remake</a> of "Nights into Dreams" for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> exclusively in Japan on 21 February 2008.

The game was also featured in a bundle named the Nightopia Dream Pack, which includes a reprint of a picture book that was released in Japan alongside the original Saturn game. A "Nights into Dreams" handheld electronic game was released by Tiger Electronics in 1997, and a port of it was later released for Tiger's unsuccessful <a href="R-Zone">R-Zone</a> console.

Claris and Eliot make a cameo appearance in Sonic Team's "<a href="Burning%20Rangers">Burning Rangers</a>" (1998), with both Claris and Eliot sending the Rangers emails thanking them for their help. "Nights into Dreams"-themed pinball areas feature in "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a>" (1998) and "<a href="Sonic%20Pinball%20Party">Sonic Pinball Party</a>" (2003), with soundtrack being featured in the latter game.

In February 1998, <a href="Archie%20Comics">Archie Comics</a> adapted "Nights into Dreams" into a three-issue comic book <a href="miniseries">miniseries</a> to test whether a Nights comic would sell well in North America. The first miniseries was loosely based on the game, with Nights identified as male despite the character's androgynous design. The company later released a second three-issue miniseries, continuing the story of the first, but the series did not gain enough sales to warrant an ongoing series. It was later added to a list of guest franchises featured in Archie Comics' "Worlds Unite" crossover between its "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28comics%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" and "<a href="Mega%20Man%20%28Archie%20Comics%29">Mega Man</a>" comics.

Neil Armstrong

Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a> and <a href="aerospace%20engineering">aeronautical engineer</a> who was the <a href="Apollo%2011%23Lunar%20surface%20operations">first person to walk on the Moon</a>. He was also a <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Aviator">naval aviator</a>, <a href="test%20pilot">test pilot</a>, and <a href="university%20professor">university professor</a>.

A graduate of <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a>, Armstrong studied aeronautical engineering with his college tuition paid for by the <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> under the <a href="James%20L.%20Holloway%2C%20Jr.%23Holloway%20Plan">Holloway Plan</a>. He became a <a href="midshipman">midshipman</a> in 1949, and a naval aviator the following year. He saw action in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, flying the <a href="Grumman%20F9F%20Panther">Grumman F9F Panther</a> from the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> . In September 1951, he was hit by <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft fire</a> while making a low bombing run, and was forced to bail out. After the war, he completed his bachelor's degree at Purdue and became a test pilot at the <a href="National%20Advisory%20Committee%20for%20Aeronautics">National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics</a> (NACA) <a href="Armstrong%20Flight%20Research%20Center">High-Speed Flight Station</a> at <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Edwards Air Force Base</a> in <a href="California">California</a>. He was the project pilot on <a href="Century%20Series">Century Series</a> fighters and flew the <a href="North%20American%20X-15">North American X-15</a> seven times. He was also a participant in the <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a>'s <a href="Man%20in%20Space%20Soonest">Man in Space Soonest</a> and <a href="Boeing%20X-20%20Dyna-Soar">X-20 Dyna-Soar</a> <a href="human%20spaceflight">human spaceflight</a> programs.

Armstrong joined the <a href="NASA%20Astronaut%20Corps">NASA Astronaut Corps</a> in the <a href="NASA%20Astronaut%20Group%202">second group</a>, which was selected in 1962. He made his first spaceflight as commander of <a href="Gemini%208">Gemini 8</a> in March 1966, becoming <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s first civilian astronaut to fly in space. During this mission with pilot <a href="David%20Scott">David Scott</a>, he performed the first <a href="Spacecraft%20docking%20and%20berthing%20mechanisms">docking</a> of two <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a>; the mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to remove a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster. During training for Armstrong's second and last spaceflight as commander of <a href="Apollo%2011">Apollo 11</a>, he had to eject from the <a href="Lunar%20Landing%20Research%20Vehicle">Lunar Landing Research Vehicle</a> moments before a crash.

In July 1969, Armstrong and Apollo 11 <a href="Lunar%20Module">Lunar Module</a> pilot <a href="Buzz%20Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a> became the first people to <a href="Moon%20landing">land on the Moon</a>, and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft while <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Michael Collins</a> remained in lunar orbit in the <a href="command%20and%20service%20module">command and service module</a>. When Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>. President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> presented Armstrong with the <a href="Congressional%20Space%20Medal%20of%20Honor">Congressional Space Medal of Honor</a> in 1978, and Armstrong and his former crewmates received a <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a> in 2009.

After he resigned from NASA in 1971, Armstrong taught in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the <a href="University%20of%20Cincinnati">University of Cincinnati</a> until 1979. He served on the <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a> accident investigation, and on the <a href="Rogers%20Commission%20Report">Rogers Commission</a>, which investigated the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger%20disaster">Space Shuttle "Challenger" disaster</a>. He acted as a spokesman for several businesses, and appeared in advertising for the automotive brand <a href="Chrysler">Chrysler</a> starting in January 1979.

Armstrong was born on August 5, 1930, near <a href="Wapakoneta%2C%20Ohio">Wapakoneta, Ohio</a>, to Stephen Koenig Armstrong and Viola Louise Engel. He was of German, Scottish and Scots-Irish ancestry, and had a younger sister, June, and a younger brother, Dean. His father worked as an <a href="auditor">auditor</a> for the <a href="Government%20of%20Ohio">Ohio state government</a>, and the family moved around the state repeatedly, living in sixteen towns over the next fourteen years. Armstrong's love for flying grew during this time, having started early when his father took his two-year-old son to the <a href="National%20Air%20Races">Cleveland Air Races</a>. When he was five or six, he experienced his first airplane flight in <a href="Warren%2C%20Ohio">Warren, Ohio</a>, when he and his father took a ride in a <a href="Ford%20Trimotor">Ford Trimotor</a>, also known as the "Tin Goose".

His father's last move was in 1944, back to Wapakoneta. Armstrong attended <a href="Blume%20High%20School">Blume High School</a>, and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield. He earned a student flight certificate on his sixteenth birthday, then <a href="First%20solo%20flight">soloed</a> in August, all before he had a driver's license. He was active in the <a href="Scouting%20in%20Ohio">Boy Scouts</a> and earned the rank of <a href="Eagle%20Scout%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Eagle Scout</a>. As an adult, he was recognized by the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a> with its <a href="Distinguished%20Eagle%20Scout%20Award">Distinguished Eagle Scout Award</a> and <a href="Silver%20Buffalo%20Award">Silver Buffalo Award</a>. On July 18, 1969, while flying toward the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, Armstrong greeted the Scouts. Among the few personal items that he carried with him to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge.

In 1947, at age 17, Armstrong began studying <a href="Aerospace%20engineering">aeronautical engineering</a> at <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a>. He was the second person in his family to attend college. He was also accepted to the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT), but an uncle who had attended MIT dissuaded him from attending, telling him that it was not necessary to go all the way to <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, for a good education. His college tuition was paid for under the <a href="James%20L.%20Holloway%2C%20Jr.%23Holloway%20Plan">Holloway Plan</a>. Successful applicants committed to two years of study, followed by two years of flight training and one year of service in the U.S. Navy as an aviator, then completion of the final two years of their <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a>. Armstrong did not take courses in naval science, nor did he join the <a href="Naval%20Reserve%20Officers%20Training%20Corps">Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps</a> at Purdue.

Armstrong's call-up from the Navy arrived on January 26, 1949, requiring him to report to <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Pensacola">Naval Air Station Pensacola</a> in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> for flight training with class 5-49. After passing the medical examinations, he became a <a href="midshipman">midshipman</a> on February 24, 1949. Flight training was conducted in a <a href="North%20American%20T-6%20Texan">North American SNJ trainer</a>, in which he soloed on September 9, 1949. On March 2, 1950, he made his first <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> landing on the , an achievement he considered comparable to his first solo flight. He was then sent to <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Corpus%20Christi">Naval Air Station Corpus Christi</a> in Texas for training on the <a href="Grumman%20F8F%20Bearcat">Grumman F8F Bearcat</a>, culminating in a carrier landing on the . On August 16, 1950, Armstrong was informed by letter that he was a fully qualified <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Aviator">naval aviator</a>. His mother and sister attended his graduation ceremony on August 23, 1950.

Armstrong's assignment was to Fleet Aircraft Service Squadron 7 (FASRON 7) at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20North%20Island">NAS San Diego</a> (now known as NAS North Island). On November 27, 1950, he was assigned to <a href="VF-51">VF-51</a>, an all-jet squadron, becoming its youngest officer, and made his first flight in a jet, a <a href="Grumman%20F9F%20Panther">Grumman F9F Panther</a>, on January 5, 1951. He was promoted to <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a> on June 5, 1951, and made his first jet carrier landing on two days later. On June 28, 1951, "Essex" had set sail for Korea, with VF-51 aboard to act as <a href="ground-attack%20aircraft">ground-attack aircraft</a>. VF-51 flew ahead to <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Barbers%20Point">Naval Air Station Barbers Point</a> in Hawaii, where it conducted fighter-bomber training before rejoining the ship at the end of July.

On August 29, 1951, Armstrong saw action in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> as an escort for a photo <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> plane over <a href="Songjin">Songjin</a>. Five days later, on September 3, he flew armed reconnaissance over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of <a href="Wonsan">Wonsan</a>. Making a low bombing run at , Armstrong's F9F Panther was hit by <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft fire</a>. While trying to regain control, he collided with a pole at a height of , which sliced off of the Panther's right wing.
Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but due to the loss of the <a href="aileron">aileron</a>, <a href="ejection%20seat">ejection</a> was his only safe option. He intended to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, but his parachute was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked him up; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of his aircraft, F9F-2 BuNo "125122".

In all, Armstrong flew 78 missions over Korea for a total of 121 hours in the air, a third of them in January 1952, with the final mission on March 5, 1952. Of 492 U.S. Navy personnel killed in the Korean War, 27 of them were from the "Essex" on this war cruise. Armstrong received the <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a> for 20 combat missions, two <a href="5/16%20inch%20star">gold stars</a> for the next 40, the <a href="Korean%20Service%20Medal">Korean Service Medal</a> and Engagement Star, the <a href="National%20Defense%20Service%20Medal">National Defense Service Medal</a> and the <a href="United%20Nations%20Korea%20Medal">United Nations Korea Medal</a>. His regular commission was terminated on February 25, 1952, and he became an ensign in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20Reserve">United States Navy Reserve</a>. On completion of his combat tour with "Essex", he was assigned to a transport squadron, VR-32, in May 1952. He was released from active duty on August 23, 1952, but remained in the reserves, and was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20%28junior%20grade%29">lieutenant (junior grade)</a> on May 9, 1953. As a reservist, he continued to fly, with VF-724 at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Glenview">Naval Air Station Glenview</a> in Illinois, and then, after moving to California, with VF-773 at <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Los%20Alamitos">Naval Air Station Los Alamitos</a>. He remained in the reserve for eight years, before resigning his commission on October 21, 1960.

After his service with the Navy, Armstrong returned to Purdue. His previously earned good but not outstanding <a href="Academic%20grading%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Six-point%20system">grades</a> now improved, lifting his final Grade Point Average (GPA) to a respectable but not outstanding 4.8 out of 6.0. He pledged the <a href="Phi%20Delta%20Theta">Phi Delta Theta</a> <a href="Fraternities%20and%20sororities%20in%20North%20America">fraternity</a>, and lived in its fraternity house. He wrote and co-directed two musicals as part of the all-student revue. The first was a version of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves", co-directed with his girlfriend Joanne Alford from the <a href="Alpha%20Chi%20Omega">Alpha Chi Omega</a> sorority, with songs from the <a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29">Walt Disney film</a>, including "<a href="Someday%20My%20Prince%20Will%20Come">Someday My Prince Will Come</a>"; the second was titled "The Land of Egelloc" ("college" spelled backwards), with music from <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> but new lyrics. He was chairman of the Purdue Aero Flying Club, and flew the club's aircraft, an <a href="Aeronca%20Aircraft">Aeronca</a> and a couple of <a href="Piper%20Aircraft">Pipers</a>, which were kept at nearby Aretz Airport in <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Indiana">Lafayette, Indiana</a>. Flying the Aeronca to Wapakoneta in 1954, he damaged it in a rough landing in a farmer's field, and it had to be hauled back to Lafayette on a trailer. He was a <a href="baritone%20horn">baritone</a> player in the <a href="Purdue%20All-American%20Marching%20Band">Purdue All-American Marching Band</a>. Ten years later he was made an honorary member of <a href="Kappa%20Kappa%20Psi">Kappa Kappa Psi</a> national band honorary fraternity. Armstrong graduated with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> degree in <a href="Aeronautical%20Engineering">Aeronautical Engineering</a> in January 1955. In 1970 he completed his <a href="Master%20of%20Science">Master of Science</a> degree in <a href="Aerospace%20Engineering">Aerospace Engineering</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> (USC). He would eventually be awarded <a href="honorary%20doctorate">honorary doctorate</a>s by several universities.

Armstrong met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in <a href="family%20and%20consumer%20science">home economics</a>, at a party hosted by Alpha Chi Omega. According to the couple, there was no real courtship, and neither could remember the exact circumstances of their engagement. They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in <a href="Wilmette%2C%20Illinois">Wilmette, Illinois</a>. When he moved to <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Edwards Air Force Base</a>, he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base, while Janet lived in the <a href="Westwood%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Westwood</a> district of <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. After one semester, they moved into a house in <a href="Antelope%20Valley">Antelope Valley</a>. Janet did not finish her degree, a fact she regretted later in life. The couple had three children: Eric, Karen, and Mark. In June 1961, Karen was diagnosed with a <a href="malignant">malignant</a> <a href="tumor">tumor</a> of the middle part of her <a href="Brainstem">brain stem</a>; X-ray treatment slowed its growth, but her health deteriorated to the point where she could no longer walk or talk. She died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, related to her weakened health, on January 28, 1962, aged two.

Following his graduation from Purdue, Armstrong became an experimental research test pilot. He applied at the <a href="National%20Advisory%20Committee%20for%20Aeronautics">National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics</a> (NACA) <a href="Armstrong%20Flight%20Research%20Center">High-Speed Flight Station</a> at Edwards Air Force Base. NACA had no open positions, and forwarded his application to the <a href="Glenn%20Research%20Center">Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory</a> in <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland</a>, where Armstrong made his first test flight on March 1, 1955. Armstrong's stint at Cleveland lasted only a couple of months before a position at the High-Speed Flight Station became available, and he reported for work there on July 11, 1955.
On his first day, Armstrong was tasked with piloting <a href="chase%20plane">chase plane</a>s during releases of experimental aircraft from modified bombers. He also flew the modified bombers, and on one of these missions had his first flight incident at Edwards. On March 22, 1956, he was in a <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a>, which was to air-drop a <a href="Douglas%20D-558-2%20Skyrocket">Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket</a>. He sat in the right-hand pilot seat while the left-hand seat commander, Stan Butchart, flew the B-29.

As they climbed to , the <a href="aircraft%20engine%20position%20number">number-four engine</a> stopped and the <a href="Propeller%20%28aircraft%29">propeller</a> began windmilling (rotating freely) in the airstream. Hitting the switch that would stop the propeller's spinning, Butchart found it slowed but then started spinning again, this time even faster than the others; if it spun too fast, it would break apart. Their aircraft needed to hold an airspeed of to launch its Skyrocket payload, and the B-29 could not land with the Skyrocket attached to its belly. Armstrong and Butchart brought the aircraft into a nose-down <a href="Attitude%20%28geometry%29">attitude</a> to increase speed, then launched the Skyrocket. At the instant of launch, the number-four engine propeller disintegrated. Pieces of it damaged the number-three engine and hit the number-two engine. Butchart and Armstrong were forced to shut down the damaged number-three engine, along with the number-one engine, due to the <a href="torque">torque</a> it created. They made a slow, circling descent from using only the number-two engine, and landed safely.

Armstrong served as project pilot on <a href="Century%20Series">Century Series</a> fighters, including the <a href="North%20American%20F-100%20Super%20Sabre">North American F-100 Super Sabre</a> A and C variants, the <a href="McDonnell%20F-101%20Voodoo">McDonnell F-101 Voodoo</a>, the <a href="Lockheed%20F-104%20Starfighter">Lockheed F-104 Starfighter</a>, the <a href="Republic%20F-105%20Thunderchief">Republic F-105 Thunderchief</a> and the <a href="Convair%20F-106%20Delta%20Dart">Convair F-106 Delta Dart</a>. He also flew the <a href="Douglas%20DC-3">Douglas DC-3</a>, <a href="Lockheed%20T-33%20Shooting%20Star">Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star</a>, <a href="North%20American%20F-86%20Sabre">North American F-86 Sabre</a>, <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II">McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II</a>, <a href="Douglas%20F5D-1%20Skylancer">Douglas F5D-1 Skylancer</a>, Boeing B-29 Superfortress, <a href="Boeing%20B-47%20Stratojet">Boeing B-47 Stratojet</a> and <a href="Boeing%20KC-135%20Stratotanker">Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker</a>, and was one of eight elite pilots involved in the <a href="NASA%20Paresev">Parasev</a> paraglider research vehicle program. Over his career, he flew more than 200 different models of aircraft. His first flight in a <a href="rocket-powered%20aircraft">rocket-powered aircraft</a> was on August 15, 1957, in the <a href="Bell%20X-1">Bell X-1</a>B, to an altitude of . On landing, the poorly designed <a href="Landing%20gear">nose landing gear</a> failed, as had happened on about a dozen previous flights of the Bell X-1B. He flew the <a href="North%20American%20X-15">North American X-15</a> seven times, including the first flight with the Q-ball system, the first flight of the number 3 X-15 airframe, and the first flight of the MH-96 adaptive flight control system. He became an employee of the <a href="National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space%20Administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA) when it was established on October 1, 1958, absorbing NACA.

Armstrong was involved in several incidents that went down in Edwards folklore or were chronicled in the memoirs of colleagues. During his sixth X-15 flight on April 20, 1962, when Armstrong was testing the MH-96 control system, he flew to a height of over (the highest he flew before <a href="Gemini%208">Gemini 8</a>). He held up the aircraft nose for too long during its descent to demonstrate the MH-96's g-limiting performance, and the X-15 ballooned back up to around . He flew past the landing field at <a href="Mach%20number">Mach</a> 3 at over in altitude, and ended up south of Edwards. After sufficient descent, he turned back toward the landing area, and landed, just missing <a href="Yucca%20brevifolia">Joshua trees</a> at the south end. It was the longest X-15 flight in both flight time and length of the ground track.

Many of the test pilots at Edwards praised Armstrong's engineering ability. <a href="Milton%20Orville%20Thompson">Milt Thompson</a> said he was "the most technically capable of the early X-15 pilots". <a href="Bill%20Dana%20%28pilot%29">Bill Dana</a> said Armstrong "had a mind that absorbed things like a sponge". Those who flew for the Air Force tended to have a different opinion, especially people like <a href="Chuck%20Yeager">Chuck Yeager</a> and <a href="William%20J.%20Knight">Pete Knight</a>, who did not have engineering degrees. Knight said that pilot-engineers flew in a way that was "more mechanical than it is flying", and gave this as the reason why some pilot-engineers got into trouble: their flying skills did not come naturally. Armstrong made seven <a href="List%20of%20X-15%20flights">flights in the X-15</a> between November 30, 1960, and July 26, 1962. He reached a top speed of Mach 5.74 () in the X-15-1, and left the Flight Research Center with a total of 2,400 flying hours.

On April 24, 1962, Armstrong flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager. Their job, flying a T-33, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake in <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a <a href="Touch-and-go%20landing">touch-and-go</a>, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. As Armstrong told the story, Yeager never tried to talk him out of it and they made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck, provoking Yeager to fits of laughter.

On May 21, 1962, Armstrong was involved in the "Nellis Affair". He was sent in an F-104 to inspect <a href="Delamar%20Dry%20Lake">Delamar Dry Lake</a> in southern Nevada, again for emergency landings. He misjudged his altitude, and did not realize that the landing gear had not fully extended. As he touched down, the landing gear began to retract; Armstrong applied full power to abort the landing, but the ventral fin and landing gear door struck the ground, damaging the radio and releasing <a href="hydraulic%20fluid">hydraulic fluid</a>. Without radio communication, Armstrong flew south to <a href="Nellis%20Air%20Force%20Base">Nellis Air Force Base</a>, past the control tower, and waggled his wings, the signal for a no-radio approach. The loss of hydraulic fluid caused the <a href="tailhook">tailhook</a> to release, and upon landing, he caught the arresting wire attached to an anchor chain, and dragged the chain along the runway.

It took thirty minutes to clear the runway and rig another arresting cable. Armstrong telephoned Edwards and asked for someone to collect him. Milt Thompson was sent in an F-104B, the only two-seater available, but a plane Thompson had never flown. With great difficulty, Thompson made it to Nellis, where a strong crosswind caused a hard landing and the left main tire suffered a blowout. The runway was again closed to clear it, and Bill Dana was sent to Nellis in a T-33, but he almost landed long. The Nellis base operations office then decided that to avoid any further problems, it would be best to find the three NASA pilots ground transport back to Edwards.

In June 1958, Armstrong was selected for the U.S. Air Force's <a href="Man%20In%20Space%20Soonest">Man In Space Soonest</a> program, but the <a href="Advanced%20Research%20Projects%20Agency">Advanced Research Projects Agency</a> (ARPA) cancelled its funding on August 1, 1958, and on November 5, 1958, it was superseded by <a href="Project%20Mercury">Project Mercury</a>, a civilian project run by NASA. As a NASA civilian test pilot, Armstrong was ineligible to become one of its astronauts at this time, as selection was restricted to military test pilots. In November 1960, he was chosen as part of the pilot consultant group for the <a href="Boeing%20X-20%20Dyna-Soar">X-20 Dyna-Soar</a>, a military space plane under development by Boeing for the U.S. Air Force, and on March 15, 1962, he was selected by the U.S. Air Force as one of seven pilot-engineers who would fly the X-20 when it got off the design board.

In April 1962, NASA announced that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts for <a href="Project%20Gemini">Project Gemini</a>, a proposed two-man spacecraft. This time, selection was open to qualified civilian test pilots. Armstrong visited the <a href="Seattle%20World%27s%20Fair">Seattle World's Fair</a> in May 1962, and attended a conference there on space exploration that was co-sponsored by NASA. After he returned from <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> on June 4, he applied to become an astronaut. His application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline, but Dick Day, a flight simulator expert with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At <a href="Brooks%20Air%20Force%20Base">Brooks Air Force Base</a> at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.

NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, <a href="Deke%20Slayton">Deke Slayton</a>, called Armstrong on September 13, 1962, and asked whether he would be interested in joining the <a href="NASA%20Astronaut%20Corps">NASA Astronaut Corps</a> as part of what the press dubbed "the <a href="NASA%20Astronaut%20Group%202">New Nine</a>"; without hesitation, Armstrong said yes. The selections were kept secret until three days later, although newspaper reports had circulated since earlier that year that he would be selected as the "first civilian astronaut". Armstrong was one of two civilian pilots selected for this group; the other was <a href="Elliot%20See">Elliot See</a>, another former naval aviator. NASA announced the selection of the second group at a press conference on September 17, 1962. Compared with the <a href="Mercury%20Seven">Mercury Seven</a> astronauts, they were younger, and had more impressive academic credentials.
On February 8, 1965, Armstrong and <a href="Elliot%20See">Elliot See</a> were announced as the backup crew for <a href="Gemini%205">Gemini 5</a>, with Armstrong as commander, supporting the prime crew of <a href="Gordon%20Cooper">Gordon Cooper</a> and <a href="Pete%20Conrad">Pete Conrad</a>. The mission's purpose was to practice <a href="space%20rendezvous">space rendezvous</a> and to develop procedures and equipment for a seven-day flight, all of which would be required for a mission to the Moon. With two other flights (<a href="Gemini%203">Gemini 3</a> and <a href="Gemini%204">Gemini 4</a>) in preparation, six crews were competing for simulator time, so Gemini 5 was postponed. It finally lifted off on August 21. Armstrong and See watched the launch at <a href="Cape%20Kennedy">Cape Kennedy</a>, then flew to the <a href="Manned%20Spacecraft%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a> in Houston. The mission was generally successful, despite a problem with the <a href="fuel%20cell">fuel cell</a>s that prevented a rendezvous. Cooper and Conrad practiced a "phantom rendezvous", carrying out the maneuver without a target.

The crew assignments for Gemini 8 were announced on September 20, 1965. Under the normal rotation system, the backup crew for one mission became the prime crew for the third mission after, but Slayton designated <a href="David%20Scott">David Scott</a> as the pilot of Gemini 8. Scott was the first member of the <a href="NASA%20Astronaut%20Group%203">third group of astronauts</a>, whose selection was announced on October 18, 1963, to receive a prime crew assignment. See was designated to command <a href="Gemini%209">Gemini 9</a>. Henceforth, each Gemini mission was commanded by a member of Armstrong's group, with a member of Scott's group as the pilot. Conrad would be Armstrong's backup this time, and <a href="Richard%20F.%20Gordon%20Jr.">Richard F. Gordon Jr.</a> his pilot. Armstrong became the first American civilian in space. (<a href="Valentina%20Tereshkova">Valentina Tereshkova</a> of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> had become the first civilian—and first woman—nearly three years earlier aboard <a href="Vostok%206">Vostok 6</a> when it launched on June 16, 1963.) Armstrong would also be the last of his group to fly in space, as See died in a <a href="1966%20NASA%20T-38%20crash">T-38 crash</a> on February 28, 1966, that also took the life of crewmate <a href="Charles%20Bassett">Charles Bassett</a>. They were replaced by the backup crew of <a href="Thomas%20P.%20Stafford">Tom Stafford</a> and <a href="Gene%20Cernan">Gene Cernan</a>, while <a href="Jim%20Lovell">Jim Lovell</a> and <a href="Buzz%20Aldrin">Buzz Aldrin</a> moved up from the backup crew of <a href="Gemini%2010">Gemini 10</a> to become the backup for Gemini 9, and would eventually fly <a href="Gemini%2012">Gemini 12</a>.

Gemini 8 launched on March 16, 1966. It was the most complex mission yet, with a rendezvous and docking with an unmanned <a href="Agena%20target%20vehicle">Agena target vehicle</a>, and the second American <a href="extravehicular%20activity">space walk</a> (EVA) by Scott. The mission was planned to last 75 hours and 55 orbits. After the Agena lifted off at 10:00:00 <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a>, the <a href="Titan%20II%20GLV">Titan II</a> rocket carrying Armstrong and Scott ignited at 11:41:02 EST, putting them into an orbit from which they chased the Agena. They achieved the first-ever docking between two spacecraft. Contact with the crew was intermittent due to the lack of tracking stations covering their entire orbits. While out of contact with the ground, the docked spacecraft began to roll, and Armstrong attempted to correct this with the Gemini's <a href="Orbit%20Attitude%20and%20Maneuvering%20System">Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System</a> (OAMS). Following the earlier advice of Mission Control, they undocked, but the roll increased dramatically until they were turning about once per second, indicating a problem with Gemini's <a href="attitude%20control">attitude control</a>. Armstrong engaged the Reentry Control System (RCS) and turned off the OAMS. Mission rules dictated that once this system was turned on, the spacecraft had to reenter at the next possible opportunity. It was later thought that damaged wiring caused one of the thrusters to stick in the on position.
A few people in the Astronaut Office, including <a href="Walter%20Cunningham">Walter Cunningham</a>, felt Armstrong and Scott "had botched their first mission". There was speculation that Armstrong could have salvaged the mission if he had turned on only one of the two RCS rings, saving the other for mission objectives. These criticisms were unfounded; no malfunction procedures had been written, and it was possible to turn on only both RCS rings, not one or the other. <a href="Gene%20Kranz">Gene Kranz</a> wrote, "The crew reacted as they were trained, and they reacted wrong because we trained them wrong." The mission planners and controllers had failed to realize that when two spacecraft were docked, they must be considered one spacecraft. Kranz considered this the mission's most important lesson. Armstrong was depressed that the mission was cut short, canceling most mission objectives and robbing Scott of his EVA. The Agena was later reused as a docking target by Gemini 10. Armstrong and Scott received the <a href="NASA%20Exceptional%20Service%20Medal">NASA Exceptional Service Medal</a>, and the Air Force awarded Scott the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> as well. Scott was promoted to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a>, and Armstrong received a $678 raise in pay to $21,653 a year (), making him NASA's highest-paid astronaut.

The final assignment for Armstrong in the Gemini program was as the back-up Command Pilot for <a href="Gemini%2011">Gemini 11</a>, announced two days after the landing of Gemini 8. Having trained for two flights, Armstrong was quite knowledgeable about the systems and took on a teaching role for the rookie backup Pilot, <a href="William%20Anders">William Anders</a>. The launch was on September 12, 1966, with Conrad and Gordon on board, who successfully completed the mission objectives, while Armstrong served as a <a href="capsule%20communicator">capsule communicator</a> (CAPCOM).

Following the flight, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> asked Armstrong and his wife to take part in a 24-day goodwill tour of South America. Also on the tour, which took in 11 countries and 14 major cities, were Dick Gordon, <a href="George%20Low">George Low</a>, their wives, and other government officials. In Paraguay, Armstrong greeted dignitaries in their local language, <a href="Guarani%20language">Guarani</a>; in Brazil he talked about the exploits of the Brazilian-born <a href="Alberto%20Santos-Dumont">Alberto Santos-Dumont</a>.

On January 27, 1967, the day of the <a href="Apollo%201%20fire">Apollo 1 fire</a>, Armstrong was in Washington, DC with Cooper, Gordon, Lovell and <a href="Scott%20Carpenter">Scott Carpenter</a> for the signing of the United Nations <a href="Outer%20Space%20Treaty">Outer Space Treaty</a>. The astronauts chatted with the assembled dignitaries until 18:45, when Carpenter went to the airport, and the others returned to the Georgetown Inn, where they each found messages to phone the <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson%20Space%20Center">Manned Spacecraft Center</a>. During these calls, they learned of the deaths of <a href="Gus%20Grissom">Gus Grissom</a>, <a href="Ed%20White%20%28astronaut%29">Ed White</a> and <a href="Roger%20B.%20Chaffee">Roger Chaffee</a> in the fire. Armstrong and the group spent the rest of the night drinking scotch and discussing what had happened.

On April 5, 1967, the same day the Apollo 1 investigation released its final report, Armstrong and 17 other astronauts gathered for a meeting with Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, "The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room." According to Cernan, only Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for <a href="Apollo%209">Apollo 9</a>, which at that stage was planned as a <a href="medium%20Earth%20orbit">medium Earth orbit</a> test of the combined <a href="lunar%20module">lunar module</a> and <a href="command%20and%20service%20module">command and service module</a>.

The crew assignment was officially announced November 20, 1967. For crewmates, Armstrong was assigned Lovell and Aldrin, from Gemini 12. After design and manufacturing delays of the lunar module (LM), <a href="Apollo%208">Apollo 8</a> and 9 swapped prime and backup crews. Based on the normal crew rotation, Armstrong would command Apollo 11, with one change: <a href="Michael%20Collins%20%28astronaut%29">Mike Collins</a> on the Apollo 8 crew began experiencing trouble with his legs. Doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae, requiring surgery. Lovell took his place on the Apollo 8 crew, and, when Collins recovered, he joined Armstrong's crew.

To give the astronauts practice piloting the LM on its descent, NASA commissioned <a href="Bell%20Aircraft">Bell Aircraft</a> to build two <a href="Lunar%20Landing%20Research%20Vehicle">Lunar Landing Research Vehicle</a>s (LLRV), later augmented with three Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV). Nicknamed the "Flying Bedsteads", they simulated the Moon's one-sixth gravity using a <a href="turbofan">turbofan</a> engine to support five-sixths of the craft's weight. On May 6, 1968, above the ground, Armstrong's controls started to degrade and the LLRV began <a href="aircraft%20principal%20axes">rolling</a>. He ejected safely before the vehicle struck the ground and burst into flames. Later analysis suggested that if he had ejected half a second later, his parachute would not have opened in time. His only injury was from biting his tongue. The LLRV was completely destroyed. Even though he was nearly killed, Armstrong maintained that without the LLRV and LLTV, the lunar landings would not have been successful, as they gave commanders essential experience in piloting the lunar landing craft.

In addition to the LLRV training, NASA began lunar landing simulator training after Apollo 10 was completed. Aldrin and Armstrong trained for a variety of scenarios that could develop during a real lunar landing. They also received briefings from geologists at NASA. When they made a geological expedition to a moon-like area in the mountains of west Texas, the press found out and crowded the area with cars and a helicopter, making it hard for the astronauts to hear the geologist who'd accompanied them.

After Armstrong served as backup commander for Apollo 8, Slayton offered him the post of commander of Apollo 11 on December 23, 1968, as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon. In a meeting that was not made public until the publication of Armstrong's biography in 2005, Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Commander Armstrong, Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, and Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, he was offering Armstrong the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell. After thinking it over for a day, Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin, as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command. Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the lunar module pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell, the commander of Gemini 12, in the number 3 position of the crew. The crew of Apollo 11 was officially announced on January 9, 1969, as Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin, with Lovell, Anders, and <a href="Fred%20Haise">Fred Haise</a> as the backup crew.

According to <a href="Chris%20Kraft">Chris Kraft</a>, a March 1969 meeting among Slayton, George Low, <a href="Bob%20Gilruth">Bob Gilruth</a>, and Kraft determined that Armstrong would be the first person on the Moon, in part because NASA management saw him as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the lunar module pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book. Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time. Slayton added, "Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out ... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision."

A <a href="Saturn%20V">Saturn V</a> rocket launched Apollo 11 from <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center%20Launch%20Complex%2039">Launch Complex 39</a> site at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> on July 16, 1969, at 13:32:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> (09:32:00 EDT local time). Armstrong's wife Janet and two sons watched from a yacht moored on the <a href="Banana%20River">Banana River</a>. During the launch, Armstrong's heart rate peaked at 110 beats per minute. He found the first stage the loudest, much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch. The Apollo CM was relatively roomy compared to the Gemini spacecraft. None of the Apollo 11 crew suffered <a href="space%20sickness">space sickness</a>, as some members of previous crews had. Armstrong was especially glad about this, as he had been prone to <a href="motion%20sickness">motion sickness</a> as a child and could experience <a href="nausea">nausea</a> after long periods of <a href="aerobatics">aerobatics</a>.
Apollo 11's objective was to land safely on the Moon, rather than to touch down at a precise location. Three minutes into the lunar descent, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the LM "Eagle" would probably touch down several miles beyond the planned landing zone. As the "Eagle"s landing <a href="radar">radar</a> acquired the surface, several computer error alarms sounded. The first was a code <a href="Jack%20Garman%231202">1202</a> alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin knew what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM <a href="Charles%20Duke">Charles Duke</a> in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by executive overflows in the <a href="lunar%20module%20computer">lunar module computer</a>. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary "<a href="In%20the%20Shadow%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28film%29">In the Shadow of the Moon</a>", the overflows were caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, causing the computer to process unnecessary radar data. When it did not have enough time to execute all tasks, the computer dropped the lower-priority ones, triggering the alarms. Aldrin said he decided to leave the radar on in case an abort was necessary when re-docking with the CM; he didn't realize it would cause the processing overflows.

When Armstrong noticed they were heading toward a landing area that seemed unsafe, he took manual control of the LM and attempted to find a safer area. This took longer than expected, and longer than most simulations had taken. For this reason, Mission Control was concerned that the LM was running low on fuel. On landing, Aldrin and Armstrong believed they had 40 seconds of fuel left, including the 20 seconds' worth which had to be saved in the event of an abort. During training, Armstrong had, on several occasions, landed the LLTV with fewer than 15 seconds of fuel; he was also confident the LM could survive a fall of up to . Post-mission analysis showed that at touchdown there were 45 to 50 seconds of propellant burn time left.

The landing on the surface of the Moon occurred several seconds after 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969. One of three probes attached to three of the lunar module's four legs made contact with the surface, a panel light in the LM illuminated, and Aldrin called out, "Contact light." Armstrong shut the engine off and said, "Shutdown." As the LM settled onto the surface, Aldrin said, "Okay, engine stop"; then they both called out some post-landing checklist items. After a ten-second pause, Duke acknowledged the landing with, "We copy you down, "Eagle"." Armstrong announced the landing to Mission Control and the world with the words, "Houston, <a href="Tranquility%20Base">Tranquility Base</a> here. The "Eagle" has landed." Aldrin and Armstrong celebrated with a brisk handshake and pat on the back. They then returned to the checklist of contingency tasks, should an emergency liftoff become necessary. After Armstrong confirmed touch down, Duke re-acknowledged, adding a comment about the flight crew's relief: "Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot." During the landing, Armstrong's heart rate ranged from 100 to 150 beats per minute.

The flight plan called for a crew rest period before extravehicular activity, but Armstrong requested the EVA be moved to earlier in the evening, <a href="Central%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">Houston time</a>. When he and Aldrin were ready to go outside, "Eagle" was depressurized, the hatch was opened, and Armstrong made his way down the ladder. At the bottom of the ladder Armstrong said, "I'm going to step off the LM now". He turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 02:56 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> July 21, 1969, then spoke the now-famous words, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."

Armstrong prepared his famous <a href="epigram">epigram</a> on his own. In a post-flight press conference, he said that he chose the words "just prior to leaving the LM." In a 1983 interview in "<a href="Esquire%20Magazine">Esquire Magazine</a>", he explained to <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a>: "I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, but I thought the chances of a successful touch down on the moon surface were about even money—fifty–fifty ... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem to me there was much point in thinking of something to say if we'd have to abort landing." In 2012, his brother Dean Armstrong said that Neil showed him a draft of the line months before the launch. Historian <a href="Andrew%20Chaikin">Andrew Chaikin</a>, who interviewed Armstrong in 1988 for his book "<a href="A%20Man%20on%20the%20Moon">A Man on the Moon</a>", disputed that Armstrong claimed to have conceived the line during the mission.

Recordings of Armstrong's transmission do not provide evidence for the indefinite article "a" before "man", though NASA and Armstrong insisted for years that static obscured it. Armstrong stated he would never make such a mistake, but after repeated listenings to recordings, he eventually conceded he must have dropped the "a". He later said he "would hope that history would grant me leeway for dropping the syllable and understand that it was certainly intended, even if it was not said—although it might actually have been". There have since been claims and counter-claims about whether acoustic analysis of the recording reveals the presence of the missing "a"; <a href="Peter%20Shann%20Ford">Peter Shann Ford</a>, an Australian computer programmer, conducted a digital audio analysis and claims that Armstrong did say "a man", but the "a" was inaudible due to the limitations of communications technology of the time. Ford and <a href="James%20R.%20Hansen">James R. Hansen</a>, Armstrong's authorized biographer, presented these findings to Armstrong and NASA representatives, who conducted their own analysis. Armstrong found Ford's analysis "persuasive." Linguists <a href="David%20Beaver">David Beaver</a> and <a href="Mark%20Liberman">Mark Liberman</a> wrote of their skepticism of Ford's claims on the blog <a href="Language%20Log">Language Log</a>. A 2016 peer-reviewed study again concluded Armstrong had included the article. NASA's transcript continues to show the "a" in parentheses.

When Armstrong made his proclamation, <a href="Voice%20of%20America">Voice of America</a> was rebroadcast live via the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> and many other stations worldwide. An estimated 530 million people viewed the event, out of a world population of approximately 3.6 billion.
About 19 minutes after Armstrong's first step, Aldrin joined him on the surface, becoming the second human to walk on the Moon. They began their tasks of investigating how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Armstrong unveiled a plaque commemorating the flight, and with Aldrin, planted the <a href="Lunar%20Flag%20Assembly">flag of the United States</a>. Although Armstrong had wanted the flag to be draped on the flagpole, it was decided to use a metal rod to hold it horizontally. However, the rod did not fully extend, leaving the flag with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after the flag planting, President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> spoke to them by telephone from his office. He spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds. In the Apollo 11 photographic record, there are only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected. The mission was planned to the minute, with the majority of photographic tasks performed by Armstrong with the single <a href="Hasselblad">Hasselblad</a> camera.

After helping to set up the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Surface%20Experiments%20Package">Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package</a>, Armstrong went for a walk to what is now known as East Crater, east of the LM, the greatest distance traveled from the LM on the mission. His final task was to remind Aldrin to leave a small package of memorial items to Soviet <a href="List%20of%20cosmonauts">cosmonauts</a> <a href="Yuri%20Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a> and <a href="Vladimir%20Komarov">Vladimir Komarov</a>, and Apollo 1 astronauts Grissom, White and Chaffee. The Apollo 11 EVA lasted two and a half hours. Each of the subsequent five landings was allotted a progressively longer EVA period; the crew of <a href="Apollo%2017">Apollo 17</a> spent over 22 hours exploring the lunar surface. In a 2010 interview, Armstrong explained that NASA limited their Moon walk because they were unsure how the spacesuits would cope with the Moon's extremely high temperature.

After they re-entered the LM, the hatch was closed and sealed. While preparing for the liftoff from the lunar surface, Armstrong and Aldrin discovered that, in their bulky spacesuits, they had broken the ignition switch for the ascent engine; using part of a pen, they pushed the circuit breaker in to activate the launch sequence. The "Eagle" then continued to its rendezvous in lunar orbit, where it docked with "Columbia", the <a href="command%20and%20service%20module">command and service module</a>. The three astronauts returned to Earth and splashed down in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, to be picked up by the .

After being released from an 18-day quarantine to ensure that they had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon, the crew were feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 38-day "Giant Leap" tour. Armstrong then took part in <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>'s 1969 <a href="USO">USO</a> show, primarily to Vietnam. In May 1970, Armstrong traveled to the Soviet Union to present a talk at the 13th annual conference of the International Committee on Space Research; after arriving in <a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a> from Poland, he traveled to Moscow where he met <a href="Premier%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Premier</a> <a href="Alexei%20Kosygin">Alexei Kosygin</a>. Armstrong was the first westerner to see the supersonic <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-144">Tupolev Tu-144</a> and was given a tour of the <a href="Yuri%20Gagarin%20Cosmonaut%20Training%20Center">Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center</a>, which he described as "a bit Victorian in nature". At the end of the day, he was surprised to view a delayed video of the launch of <a href="Soyuz%209">Soyuz 9</a> as it had not occurred to Armstrong that the mission was taking place, even though <a href="Valentina%20Tereshkova">Valentina Tereshkova</a> had been his host and her husband, <a href="Andriyan%20Nikolayev">Andriyan Nikolayev</a>, was on board.

Shortly after Apollo 11, Armstrong announced that he did not plan to fly in space again. He was appointed Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics for the Office of Advanced Research and Technology at ARPA, served in the position for a year, then resigned from it and NASA in 1971. He accepted a teaching position in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the <a href="University%20of%20Cincinnati">University of Cincinnati</a>, having chosen Cincinnati over other universities, including his "alma mater" Purdue, because Cincinnati had a small aerospace department, and said he hoped the faculty there would not be annoyed that he came straight into a professorship with only a USC master's degree. He began his master's degree while stationed at Edwards years before, and completed it after Apollo 11 by presenting a report on various aspects of Apollo, instead of a thesis on the simulation of hypersonic flight.

At Cincinnati, Armstrong was University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. He took a heavy teaching load, taught core classes, and created two graduate-level classes: aircraft design and experimental flight mechanics. He was considered a good teacher, and a tough grader. His research activities during this time did not involve his work at NASA, as he did not want to give the appearance of favoritism; he later regretted the decision. After teaching for eight years, Armstrong resigned in 1980. When the university changed from an independent municipal university to a state school, bureaucracy increased. He did not want to be a part of the faculty collective bargaining group, so he decided to teach half-time. According to Armstrong, he had the same amount of work but received half his salary. In 1979, less than 10% of his income came from his university salary. Employees at the university did not know why he left.

In 1970, after an explosion aboard <a href="Apollo%2013">Apollo 13</a> aborted its lunar landing, Armstrong was part of <a href="Edgar%20Cortright">Edgar Cortright</a>'s investigation of the mission. He produced a detailed chronology of the flight. He determined that a 28-volt thermostat switch in an oxygen tank, which was supposed to have been replaced with a 65-volt version, led to the explosion. Cortright's report recommended the entire tank be redesigned at a cost of $40 million. Many NASA managers, including Armstrong, opposed the recommendation, since only the thermostat switch had caused the problem. They lost the argument and the tanks were redesigned.

In 1986, President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> asked Armstrong to join the <a href="Rogers%20Commission%20Report">Rogers Commission</a> investigating the destruction of the Space Shuttle "Challenger". Armstrong was made vice chairman of the commission, and held private interviews with contacts he had developed over the years to help determine the cause of the disaster. He helped limit the committee's recommendations to nine, believing that if there were too many, NASA would not act on them.
Armstrong was appointed to a fourteen-member commission by President Reagan to develop a plan for American civilian spaceflight in the 21st century. The commission was chaired by former NASA administrator Dr. <a href="Thomas%20O.%20Paine">Thomas O. Paine</a>, with whom Armstrong had worked during the Apollo program. The group published a book titled "Pioneering the Space Frontier: The Report on the National Commission on Space", recommending a permanent lunar base by 2006 and sending people to Mars by 2015. The recommendations were largely ignored, overshadowed by the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger%20disaster">"Challenger" disaster</a>.

Armstrong and his wife attended the memorial service for the victims of the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster">Space Shuttle "Columbia" disaster</a> in 2003, at the invitation of President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>.

After Armstrong retired from NASA in 1971, he acted as a spokesman for several businesses. The first company to successfully approach him was <a href="Chrysler">Chrysler</a>, for whom he appeared in advertising starting in January 1979. Armstrong thought they had a strong engineering division, and they were in financial difficulty. He later acted as a spokesman for other American companies, including General Time Corporation and the Bankers Association of America. He only acted as a spokesman for American companies.

Along with spokesman duties, he also served on the board of directors of several companies. The first company which Armstrong joined the board was <a href="Gates%20Learjet">Gates Learjet</a>, chairing their technical committee. He flew their new and experimental jets and even set a climb and altitude record for business jets. Armstrong became a member of <a href="Cincinnati%20Gas%20%26amp%3B%20Electric%20Company">Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company</a>'s board in 1973. They were interested in nuclear power and wanted to increase the company's technical competence. He served on the board of <a href="Taft%20Broadcasting">Taft Broadcasting</a>, also based in Cincinnati. Armstrong joined <a href="Thiokol">Thiokol</a>'s board in 1989, after he was vice-chair of the Rogers Commission; the <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> "Challenger" was destroyed due to a problem with the Thiokol-manufactured solid rocket boosters. When Armstrong left the University of Cincinnati, he became the chairman of Cardwell International Ltd., a company that manufactured drilling rigs. He served on additional aerospace boards, first <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> in 1978 and later <a href="Eaton%20Corporation">Eaton Corporation</a> in 1980. He was asked to chair the board of directors for a subsidiary of Eaton, AIL Systems. He chaired the board through the company's 2000 merger with <a href="EDO%20Corporation">EDO Corporation</a>, until his retirement in 2002.
In 1985, professional expedition leader Mike Dunn organized a trip to take men he deemed the "greatest explorers" to the <a href="North%20Pole">North Pole</a>. The group included Armstrong, <a href="Edmund%20Hillary">Edmund Hillary</a>, <a href="Peter%20Hillary">Hillary's son Peter</a>, <a href="Steve%20Fossett">Steve Fossett</a>, and <a href="Patrick%20Morrow">Patrick Morrow</a>. They arrived at the Pole on April 6, 1985. Armstrong said he was curious to see what it looked like from the ground, as he had seen it only from the Moon. He did not inform the media of the trip, preferring to keep it private.

In 2010, Armstrong voiced the character of Dr. Jack Morrow in "", an animated educational sci-fi adventure film initiated by JPL/NASA through a grant from Jet Propulsion Lab. Between 1991 and 1993, he hosted "<a href="First%20Flights%20with%20Neil%20Armstrong">First Flights with Neil Armstrong</a>", an <a href="aviation%20history">aviation history</a> <a href="documentary%20series">documentary series</a> on <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20%28TV%20channel%29">A&E</a>.

Armstrong kept a low profile later in his life, leading to the belief that he was a recluse. He turned down most requests for interviews and public appearances. Michael Collins said in his book "Carrying the Fire" that when Armstrong moved to a dairy farm to become a college professor, it was like he "retreated to his castle and pulled up the drawbridge". Armstrong found this amusing, and said, "...those of us that live out in the hinterlands think that people that live inside the Beltway are the ones that have the problems." Andrew Chaikin says in "A Man on the Moon" that Armstrong kept a low profile but was not a recluse, citing his participation in interviews, advertisements for Chrysler, and hosting a cable television series.

Armstrong used to autograph everything except <a href="first%20day%20cover">first day cover</a>s. Around 1993, he found out his signatures were being sold online, and that most of them were forgeries, and stopped giving autographs.

For many years, he wrote letters congratulating new Eagle Scouts on their accomplishment, but decided to quit the practice in the 1990s because he felt the letters should be written by people who knew the scout. (In 2003, he received 950 congratulation requests.) This contributed to the myth of his reclusiveness.

Armstrong's family described him as a "reluctant American hero". Recalling Armstrong's humility, <a href="John%20Glenn">John Glenn</a>, the first American to orbit Earth, told CNN: "[Armstrong] didn't feel that he should be out huckstering himself. He was a humble person, and that's the way he remained after his lunar flight, as well as before." Some former astronauts, including Glenn and <a href="Harrison%20Schmitt">Harrison Schmitt</a>, sought political careers after leaving NASA; but although Armstrong was approached by groups from both political parties, he declined the offers. He described his political leanings as favoring <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a> and opposing the United States acting as the "world's policeman".

When Armstrong applied at a local Methodist church to lead a Boy Scout troop in the late 1950s, he gave his religious affiliation as "<a href="deist">deist</a>". His mother later said that Armstrong's religious views caused her grief and distress in later life, as she was more religious. In the early 1980s, Armstrong was the subject of a hoax saying that he converted to Islam after hearing the "<a href="adhan">adhan</a>", the Muslim call to prayer, while walking on the Moon. The Indonesian singer Suhaemi wrote a song called "Gema Suara Adzan di Bulan" ("The Resonant Sound of the Call to Prayer on the Moon"), describing Armstrong's conversion; the song was discussed widely in <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a> news outlets in 1983. Similar hoax stories were seen in Egypt and Malaysia. In March 1983, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a> responded by issuing a message to embassies and consulates in Muslim countries saying that Armstrong "has not converted to Islam". The hoax surfaced occasionally for the next three decades. Part of the confusion arose from the similarity between the names of Armstrong's American residence in <a href="Lebanon%2C%20Ohio">Lebanon, Ohio</a>, and the country of <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, which has a majority Muslim population.

In 1972, Armstrong visited the town of <a href="Langholm">Langholm</a>, Scotland, the traditional seat of <a href="Clan%20Armstrong">Clan Armstrong</a>. He was made the first freeman of the <a href="burgh">burgh</a>, and happily declared the town his home. The <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> read from an unrepealed 400-year-old law that required him to hang any Armstrong found in the town.

While working at his farm near Lebanon, Ohio, in November 1978, Armstrong jumped off the back of his grain truck and his wedding ring was caught in the wheel, tearing off the tip of his left hand's ring finger. He collected the severed digit and packed it in ice, and surgeons reattached it at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. In February 1991, a year after his father died, and nine months after the death of his mother, Armstrong suffered a mild heart attack while skiing with friends at <a href="Aspen%2C%20Colorado">Aspen, Colorado</a>.

Armstrong and his first wife, Janet, separated in 1990 and divorced in 1994, after 38 years of marriage. He met his second wife, Carol Held Knight, at a golf tournament in 1992, when they were seated together at breakfast. She said little to Armstrong, but two weeks later he called her to ask what she was doing. She replied that she was cutting down a cherry tree, and 35 minutes later Armstrong was at her house to help. They were married in Ohio on June 12, 1994, and had a second ceremony at San Ysidro Ranch in California. He lived in <a href="Indian%20Hill%2C%20Ohio">Indian Hill, Ohio</a>.

Armstrong guarded the use of his name, image, and famous quote. When it was launched in 1981, <a href="MTV">MTV</a> wanted to use his quote in its <a href="station%20identification">station identification</a>, with the American flag replaced with the MTV logo, but he refused the use of his voice and likeness. He sued <a href="Hallmark%20Cards">Hallmark Cards</a> in 1994 when they used his name, and a recording of the "one small step" quote, in a Christmas ornament without his permission. The lawsuit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, which Armstrong donated to Purdue. In May 2005, Armstrong became involved in a legal dispute with his barber of 20 years, Mark Sizemore. After cutting Armstrong's hair, Sizemore sold some of it to a collector for $3,000 without Armstrong's knowledge. Armstrong threatened legal action against Sizemore unless he returned the hair or donated the proceeds to a charity of Armstrong's choosing. Sizemore, unable to retrieve the hair, donated the proceeds to charity.

Armstrong underwent <a href="coronary%20artery%20bypass%20surgery">bypass surgery</a> on August 7, 2012 to relieve <a href="Coronary%20disease">blocked coronary arteries</a>. Although he was reportedly recovering well, he developed complications in the hospital and died on August 25, in Cincinnati, Ohio, aged 82. The <a href="White%20House">White House</a> released a statement describing Armstrong as "among the greatest of American heroes—not just of his time, but of all time". It went on to say that Armstrong had carried the aspirations of the United States' citizens and had delivered "a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten."

Armstrong's family released a statement describing him as a "reluctant American hero [who had] served his nation proudly, as a navy fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut ... While we mourn the loss of a very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves. For those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil, we have a simple request. Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink." It prompted many responses, including the <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> <a href="hashtag">hashtag</a> "#WinkAtTheMoon".

Buzz Aldrin called Armstrong "a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew", and said he was disappointed that they would not be able to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing together in 2019. Michael Collins said, "He was the best, and I will miss him terribly." NASA Administrator <a href="Charles%20F.%20Bolden%2C%20Jr.">Charles Bolden</a> said, "As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own".
A tribute was held for Armstrong on September 13 at <a href="Washington%20National%20Cathedral">Washington National Cathedral</a>, whose Space Window depicts the Apollo 11 mission and holds a sliver of Moon rock amid its stained-glass panels. In attendance were Armstrong's Apollo 11 crewmates, Collins and Aldrin; Gene Cernan, the Apollo 17 mission commander and last man to walk on the Moon; and former senator and astronaut John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. In his eulogy, Charles Bolden praised Armstrong's "courage, grace, and humility". Cernan recalled Armstrong's low-fuel approach to the Moon: "When the gauge says empty, we all know there's a gallon or two left in the tank!" <a href="Diana%20Krall">Diana Krall</a> sang the song "<a href="Fly%20Me%20to%20the%20Moon">Fly Me to the Moon</a>". Collins led prayers. Scott spoke, possibly for the first time, about an incident during their Gemini 8 mission: minutes before the hatch was to be sealed, glue spilled on his harness and prevented it from being buckled, threatening to abort the mission. Armstrong then called on Conrad to solve the problem, which he did, and the mission proceeded. "That happened because Neil Armstrong was a team player – he always worked on behalf of the team." On September 14, Armstrong's cremated remains were scattered in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> from the . Flags were flown at <a href="half-mast">half-staff</a> on the day of Armstrong's funeral.

Armstrong received many honors and awards, including the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> from President Nixon, the <a href="Cullum%20Geographical%20Medal">Cullum Geographical Medal</a> from the <a href="American%20Geographical%20Society">American Geographical Society</a>, and the <a href="Collier%20Trophy">Collier Trophy</a> from the <a href="National%20Aeronautic%20Association">National Aeronautic Association</a> (1969); the <a href="NASA%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">NASA Distinguished Service Medal</a> and the <a href="Dr.%20Robert%20H.%20Goddard%20Memorial%20Trophy">Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy</a> (1970); the <a href="Sylvanus%20Thayer%20Award">Sylvanus Thayer Award</a> by the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> (1971); the <a href="Congressional%20Space%20Medal%20of%20Honor">Congressional Space Medal of Honor</a> from President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> (1978); the <a href="Wright%20Brothers%20Memorial%20Trophy">Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy</a> from the National Aeronautic Association (2001); and a <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a> (2011). Armstrong and his Apollo 11 crewmates were the 1999 recipients of the <a href="Langley%20Gold%20Medal">Langley Gold Medal</a> from the Smithsonian Institution. On April 18, 2006, he received NASA's Ambassador of Exploration Award. The <a href="Space%20Foundation">Space Foundation</a> named Armstrong as a recipient of its 2013 General James E. Hill Lifetime Space Achievement Award.

He was awarded his <a href="Astronaut%20Badge">Naval Astronaut badge</a> in a ceremony on board the aircraft carrier on March 10, 2010, in a ceremony attended by Lovell and Cernan.
The lunar crater <a href="Armstrong%20%28crater%29">Armstrong</a>, from the Apollo 11 landing site, and <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a> <a href="6469%20Armstrong">6469 Armstrong</a> are named in his honor. There are more than a dozen elementary, middle and high schools named for Armstrong in the United States, and many places around the world have streets, buildings, schools, and other places named for him and/or Apollo. The <a href="Armstrong%20Air%20and%20Space%20Museum">Armstrong Air and Space Museum</a>, in Armstrong's hometown of Wapakoneta, and the airport in <a href="New%20Knoxville%2C%20Ohio">New Knoxville, Ohio</a> where he took his first flying lessons at 15, are named after him. Purdue University announced in October 2004 that its new engineering building would be named <a href="Purdue%20University%20College%20of%20Engineering">Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering</a>; the building was dedicated on October 27, 2007 during a ceremony at which Armstrong was joined by fourteen other Purdue astronauts. The NASA Dryden Flight Research Center was renamed the NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center in 2014. In September 2012, the U.S. Navy announced that the first "Armstrong"-class vessel would be named . Delivered to the Navy on September 23, 2015, it is a modern oceanographic research platform supporting a wide range of activities by academic groups.
Armstrong's authorized biography, "", was published in 2005. For many years, Armstrong turned down biography offers from authors such as <a href="Stephen%20Ambrose">Stephen Ambrose</a> and <a href="James%20A.%20Michener">James A. Michener</a>, but agreed to work with James R. Hansen after reading one of Hansen's other biographies. A <a href="First%20Man%20%28film%29">film adaptation of the book</a>, starring <a href="Ryan%20Gosling">Ryan Gosling</a> and directed by <a href="Damien%20Chazelle">Damien Chazelle</a>, was released in October 2018.

In July 2018, Armstrong's family put his collection of memorabilia up for sale, including his Boy Scout cap, and various flags and medals flown on his space missions. A series of auctions was held on November 1 to 3, 2018, that realized $5,276,320. Two fragments of wood from the propeller and four pieces of fabric from the wing from the 1903 "<a href="Wright%20Flyer">Wright Flyer</a>" that Armstrong took to the Moon fetched between $112,500 and $275,000 each.

In a 2010 "Space Foundation" survey, Armstrong was ranked as the #1 most popular space hero; and in 2013, "<a href="Flying%20%28magazine%29">Flying</a>" magazine ranked him #1 on its list of 51 Heroes of Aviation. The press often asked Armstrong for his views on the future of spaceflight. In 2005, he said that a <a href="human%20mission%20to%20Mars">human mission to Mars</a> would be easier than the lunar challenge of the 1960s. In 2010, he made a rare public criticism of the decision to cancel the <a href="Ares%20I">Ares I</a> launch vehicle and the <a href="Constellation%20program">Constellation Moon landing program</a>.

In an open letter also signed by fellow Apollo veterans Lovell and Cernan, he noted, "For The United States, the leading space faring nation for nearly half a century, to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, destines our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature". Armstrong also publicly recalled his initial concerns about the Apollo 11 mission, when he had believed there was only a 50% chance of landing on the Moon. "I was elated, ecstatic and extremely surprised that we were successful", he later said. On November 18, 2010, aged 80, Armstrong said in a speech during the "<a href="Meet%20the%20Future%2C%20Science%20%26amp%3B%20Technology%20Summit%202010">Science & Technology Summit</a>" in The Hague, Netherlands, that he would offer his services as commander on a mission to Mars if he were asked.

Niobium

Niobium, formerly known as columbium, is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 41. It is a soft, grey, crystalline, <a href="ductile">ductile</a> <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>, often found in the minerals <a href="pyrochlore">pyrochlore</a> and <a href="columbite">columbite</a>, hence the former name "columbium". Its name comes from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, specifically <a href="Niobe">Niobe</a>, who was the daughter of <a href="Tantalus">Tantalus</a>, the namesake of <a href="tantalum">tantalum</a>. The name reflects the great similarity between the two elements in their physical and chemical properties, making them difficult to distinguish.

The English chemist <a href="Charles%20Hatchett">Charles Hatchett</a> reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist <a href="William%20Hyde%20Wollaston">William Hyde Wollaston</a> wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist <a href="Heinrich%20Rose">Heinrich Rose</a> determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States.

It was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading producer of niobium and <a href="ferroniobium">ferroniobium</a>, an <a href="alloy">alloy</a> of 60–70% niobium with iron. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special <a href="steel">steel</a> such as that used in gas <a href="Pipeline%20transport">pipelines</a>. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing <a href="superalloy">superalloy</a>s is important for its use in <a href="jet%20engine">jet</a> and <a href="rocket%20engine">rocket engine</a>s.

Niobium is used in various <a href="Superconductivity">superconducting</a> materials. These <a href="Type-II%20superconductor">superconducting alloys</a>, also containing <a href="titanium">titanium</a> and <a href="tin">tin</a>, are widely used in the <a href="superconducting%20magnet">superconducting magnet</a>s of <a href="Magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">MRI scanners</a>. Other applications of niobium include welding, nuclear industries, electronics, optics, <a href="numismatics">numismatics</a>, and jewelry. In the last two applications, the low toxicity and iridescence produced by <a href="Anodizing">anodization</a> are highly desired properties. Niobium is considered a <a href="Technology-critical%20element">technology-critical element</a>.

Niobium was <a href="Discovery%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">identified</a> by English chemist <a href="Charles%20Hatchett">Charles Hatchett</a> in 1801. He found a new element in a mineral sample that had been sent to England from <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, United States in 1734 by John Winthrop F.R.S. (grandson of <a href="John%20Winthrop%20the%20Younger">John Winthrop the Younger</a>) and named the mineral "columbite" and the new element "columbium" after "<a href="Columbia%20%28name%29">Columbia</a>", the poetical name for the United States. The "columbium" discovered by Hatchett was probably a mixture of the new element with tantalum.

Subsequently, there was considerable confusion over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related tantalum. In 1809, English chemist <a href="William%20Hyde%20Wollaston">William Hyde Wollaston</a> compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918 g/cm, and tantalum—<a href="tantalite">tantalite</a>, with a density over 8 g/cm, and concluded that the two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name tantalum. This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by German chemist <a href="Heinrich%20Rose">Heinrich Rose</a>, who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of <a href="Tantalus">Tantalus</a>: "niobium" (from <a href="Niobe">Niobe</a>) and "<a href="pelopium">pelopium</a>" (from <a href="Pelops">Pelops</a>). This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between tantalum and niobium. The claimed new elements "pelopium", "<a href="ilmenium">ilmenium</a>", and "dianium" were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and tantalum.

The differences between tantalum and niobium were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by <a href="Christian%20Wilhelm%20Blomstrand">Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand</a> and <a href="Henri%20Etienne%20Sainte-Claire%20Deville">Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville</a>, as well as <a href="Louis%20J.%20Troost">Louis J. Troost</a>, who determined the formulas of some of the compounds in 1865 and finally by Swiss chemist <a href="Jean%20Charles%20Galissard%20de%20Marignac">Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac</a> in 1866, who all proved that there were only two elements. Articles on "ilmenium" continued to appear until 1871.

De Marignac was the first to prepare the metal in 1864, when he <a href="redox">reduced</a> niobium chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>. Although de Marignac was able to produce tantalum-free niobium on a larger scale by 1866, it was not until the early 20th century that niobium was used in <a href="incandescent%20lamp">incandescent lamp</a> filaments, the first commercial application. This use quickly became obsolete through the replacement of niobium with <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a>, which has a higher melting point. That niobium improves the <a href="Microalloyed%20steel">strength of steel</a> was first discovered in the 1920s, and this application remains its predominant use. In 1961, the American physicist <a href="Eugene%20Kunzler">Eugene Kunzler</a> and coworkers at <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a> discovered that <a href="niobium-tin">niobium-tin</a> continues to exhibit superconductivity in the presence of strong electric currents and magnetic fields, making it the first material to support the high currents and fields necessary for useful high-power magnets and electrical power <a href="machinery">machinery</a>. This discovery enabled — two decades later — the production of long multi-strand cables wound into coils to create large, powerful <a href="electromagnet">electromagnet</a>s for rotating machinery, particle accelerators, and particle detectors.

"Columbium" (symbol "Cb") was the name originally bestowed by Hatchett upon his discovery of the metal in 1801. The name reflected that the type specimen of the <a href="ore">ore</a> came from America (<a href="Columbia%20%28name%29">Columbia</a>). This name remained in use in American journals—the last paper published by <a href="American%20Chemical%20Society">American Chemical Society</a> with "columbium" in its title dates from 1953—while "niobium" was used in Europe. To end this confusion, the name "niobium" was chosen for element 41 at the 15th Conference of the Union of Chemistry in Amsterdam in 1949. A year later this name was officially adopted by the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a> (IUPAC) after 100 years of controversy, despite the chronological precedence of the name "columbium". This was a compromise of sorts; the IUPAC accepted <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> instead of wolfram in deference to North American usage; and "niobium" instead of "columbium" in deference to European usage. While many US chemical societies and government organizations typically use the official IUPAC name, some metallurgists and metal societies still use the original American name, ""columbium"".

Niobium is a <a href="lustre%20%28mineralogy%29">lustrous</a>, grey, <a href="ductility">ductile</a>, <a href="paramagnetism">paramagnetic</a> <a href="metal">metal</a> in <a href="Group%205%20element">group 5</a> of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> (see table), with an electron configuration in the outermost <a href="electron%20shell">shells</a> atypical for group 5. (This can be observed in the neighborhood of <a href="ruthenium">ruthenium</a> (44), <a href="rhodium">rhodium</a> (45), and <a href="palladium">palladium</a> (46).)

Although it is thought to have a <a href="body-centered%20cubic">body-centered cubic</a> crystal structure from absolute zero to its melting point, high-resolution measurements of the thermal expansion along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are inconsistent with a cubic structure. Therefore, further research and discovery in this area is expected.

Niobium becomes a <a href="superconductor">superconductor</a> at <a href="cryogenics">cryogenic</a> temperatures. At atmospheric pressure, it has the highest critical temperature of the elemental superconductors at 9.2 <a href="Kelvin">K</a>. Niobium has the greatest <a href="superconductor%23Meissner%20effect">magnetic penetration depth</a> of any element. In addition, it is one of the three elemental <a href="Type%20II%20superconductor">Type II superconductor</a>s, along with <a href="vanadium">vanadium</a> and <a href="technetium">technetium</a>. The superconductive properties are strongly dependent on the purity of the niobium metal.

When very pure, it is comparatively soft and ductile, but impurities make it harder.

The metal has a low <a href="Neutron%20capture%23Capture%20cross%20section">capture cross-section</a> for thermal <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s; thus it is used in the nuclear industries where neutron transparent structures are desired.

The metal takes on a bluish tinge when exposed to air at room temperature for extended periods. Despite a high melting point in elemental form (2,468 °C), it has a lower density than other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is corrosion-resistant, exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms <a href="dielectric">dielectric</a> <a href="oxide">oxide</a> layers.

Niobium is slightly less <a href="electropositive">electropositive</a> and more compact than its predecessor in the periodic table, <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a>, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, as a result of the <a href="lanthanide%20contraction">lanthanide contraction</a>. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.

Niobium in the Earth's crust comprises one stable <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, Nb. By 2003, at least 32 <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a>s had been synthesized, ranging in <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a> from 81 to 113. The most stable of these is Nb with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 34.7 million years. One of the least stable is Nb, with an estimated half-life of 30 milliseconds. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable Nb tend to decay by <a href="beta%20decay">β decay</a>, and those that are heavier tend to decay by <a href="beta%20decay">β decay</a>, with some exceptions. Nb, Nb, and Nb have minor β delayed <a href="proton%20emission">proton emission</a> decay paths, Nb decays by <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> and <a href="positron%20emission">positron emission</a>, and Nb decays by both <a href="positron">β</a> and <a href="electron">β</a> decay.

At least 25 <a href="nuclear%20isomer">nuclear isomer</a>s have been described, ranging in atomic mass from 84 to 104. Within this range, only Nb, Nb, and Nb do not have isomers. The most stable of niobium's isomers is Nb with a half-life of 16.13 years. The least stable isomer is Nb with a half-life of 103 ns. All of niobium's isomers decay by <a href="isomeric%20transition">isomeric transition</a> or beta decay except Nb, which has a minor electron capture branch.

Niobium is estimated to be the 34th <a href="Abundance%20of%20elements%20in%20Earth%27s%20crust">most common element in the Earth’s crust</a>, with 20 <a href="Parts%20per%20million">ppm</a>. Some think that the abundance on Earth is much greater, and that the element's high density has concentrated it in the Earth’s core. The free element is not found in nature, but niobium occurs in combination with other elements in minerals. Minerals that contain niobium often also contain tantalum. Examples include <a href="Ferrocolumbite">columbite</a> ((Fe,Mn)(Nb,Ta)O) and <a href="coltan">columbite–tantalite</a> (or "coltan", (Fe,Mn)(Ta,Nb)O). Columbite–tantalite minerals (the most common species being columbite-(Fe) and tantalite-(Fe), where "-(Fe)" is the Levinson suffix informing about the prevailence of iron over other elements like manganese) are most usually found as accessory minerals in <a href="pegmatite">pegmatite</a> intrusions, and in alkaline intrusive rocks. Less common are the niobates of <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, <a href="uranium">uranium</a>, <a href="thorium">thorium</a> and the <a href="rare%20earth%20element">rare earth element</a>s. Examples of such niobates are <a href="pyrochlore">pyrochlore</a> ((Na,Ca)NbO(OH,F)) (now a group name, with a relatively common example being, e.g., fluorcalciopyrochlore) and <a href="euxenite">euxenite</a> (correctly named euxenite-(Y)) ((Y,Ca,Ce,U,Th)(Nb,Ta,Ti)O). These large deposits of niobium have been found associated with <a href="carbonatite">carbonatite</a>s (<a href="carbonate%20minerals">carbonate</a>-<a href="silicate">silicate</a> <a href="igneous%20rocks">igneous rocks</a>) and as a constituent of pyrochlore. 

The three largest currently mined deposits of pyrochlore, two in Brazil and one in Canada, were found in the 1950s, and are still the major producers of niobium mineral concentrates. The largest deposit is hosted within a carbonatite intrusion in <a href="Arax%C3%A1">Araxá</a>, state of <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a>, Brazil, owned by CBMM (<a href="Companhia%20Brasileira%20de%20Metalurgia%20e%20Minera%C3%A7%C3%A3o">Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Mineração</a>); the other active Brazilian deposit is located near <a href="Catal%C3%A3o">Catalão</a>, state of <a href="Goi%C3%A1s">Goiás</a>, and owned by <a href="China%20Molybdenum">China Molybdenum</a>, also hosted within a carbonatite intrusion. Together, those two mines produce about 88% of the world's supply. Brazil also has a large but still unexploited deposit near <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Gabriel%20da%20Cachoeira">São Gabriel da Cachoeira</a>, state of <a href="Amazonas%20%28Brazilian%20state%29">Amazonas</a>, as well as a few smaller deposits, notably in the state of <a href="Roraima">Roraima</a>.

The third largest producer of niobium is the carbonatite-hosted <a href="Niobec">Niobec</a> mine, in <a href="Saint-Honor%C3%A9%2C%20Quebec">Saint-Honoré</a>, near <a href="Chicoutimi">Chicoutimi</a>, Quebec, Canada, owned by <a href="Magris%20Resources">Magris Resources</a>. It produces between 7% and 10% of the world's supply.

After the separation from the other minerals, the mixed oxides of tantalum <a href="tantalum%20pentoxide">TaO</a> and niobium <a href="Niobium%20pentoxide">NbO</a> are obtained. The first step in the processing is the reaction of the oxides with <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">hydrofluoric acid</a>:

The first industrial scale separation, developed by <a href="Jean%20Charles%20Galissard%20de%20Marignac">de Marignac</a>, exploits the differing solubilities of the complex niobium and tantalum <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a>s, dipotassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate (K<nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<nowiki>]</nowiki>·HO) and dipotassium heptafluorotantalate (K<nowiki>[</nowiki>TaF<nowiki>]</nowiki>) in water. Newer processes use the liquid extraction of the fluorides from <a href="aqueous">aqueous</a> solution by <a href="organic%20solvents">organic solvents</a> like <a href="cyclohexanone">cyclohexanone</a>. The complex niobium and tantalum fluorides are extracted separately from the <a href="organic%20solvent">organic solvent</a> with water and either precipitated by the addition of <a href="potassium%20fluoride">potassium fluoride</a> to produce a potassium fluoride complex, or precipitated with <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> as the pentoxide:

Followed by:

Several methods are used for the <a href="Reduction%20%28chemistry%29">reduction</a> to metallic niobium. The <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of a molten mixture of K<nowiki>[</nowiki>NbOF<nowiki>]</nowiki> and <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a> is one; the other is the reduction of the fluoride with <a href="sodium">sodium</a>. With this method, a relatively high purity niobium can be obtained. In large scale production, NbO is reduced with hydrogen or carbon. In the <a href="aluminothermic%20reaction">aluminothermic reaction</a>, a mixture of <a href="iron%20oxide">iron oxide</a> and niobium oxide is reacted with <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>:

Small amounts of oxidizers like <a href="sodium%20nitrate">sodium nitrate</a> are added to enhance the reaction. The result is <a href="aluminium%20oxide">aluminium oxide</a> and <a href="ferroniobium">ferroniobium</a>, an alloy of iron and niobium used in steel production. Ferroniobium contains between 60 and 70% niobium. Without iron oxide, the aluminothermic process is used to produce niobium. Further purification is necessary to reach the grade for <a href="superconductive">superconductive</a> alloys. <a href="Electron%20beam%20melting">Electron beam melting</a> under vacuum is the method used by the two major distributors of niobium.

, <a href="Companhia%20Brasileira%20de%20Metalurgia%20e%20Minera%C3%A7%C3%A3o">CBMM</a> from Brazil controlled 85 percent of the world's niobium production. The <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> estimates that the production increased from 38,700 tonnes in 2005 to 44,500 tonnes in 2006. Worldwide resources are estimated to be 4,400,000 tonnes. During the ten-year period between 1995 and 2005, the production more than doubled, starting from 17,800 tonnes in 1995. Between 2009 and 2011, production was stable at 63,000 tonnes per year, with a slight decrease in 2012 to only 50,000 tonnes per year.

Lesser amounts are found in Malawi's Kanyika Deposit (<a href="Kanyika%20mine">Kanyika mine</a>).

In many ways, niobium is similar to <a href="tantalum">tantalum</a> and <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a>. It reacts with most nonmetals at high temperatures; with <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a> at room temperature; with <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> at 200 °<a href="Celsius">C</a>; and with <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> at 400 °C, with products that are frequently interstitial and nonstoichiometric. The metal begins to <a href="oxidation">oxidize</a> in air at 200 °<a href="Celsius">C</a>. It resists corrosion by fused <a href="alkali%20metal">alkalis</a> and by acids, including <a href="aqua%20regia">aqua regia</a>, <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric</a>, <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric</a>, <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric</a> and <a href="phosphoric%20acid">phosphoric acid</a>s. Niobium is attacked by <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">hydrofluoric acid</a> and hydrofluoric/nitric acid mixtures.

Although niobium exhibits all of the formal oxidation states from +5 to −1, the most common compounds have niobium in the +5 state. Characteristically, compounds in oxidation states less than 5+ display Nb–Nb bonding. In aqueous solutions, niobium only exhibit the +5 oxidation state. It is also readily prone to hydrolysis and is barely soluble in dilute solutions of <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric</a>, <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric</a>, <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric</a> and <a href="phosphoric%20acid">phosphoric acid</a>s due to the precipitation of hydrous Nb oxide. Nb(V) is also slightly soluble in alkaline media due to the formation of soluble polyoxoniobate species.

Niobium forms <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s in the <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>s +5 (<a href="Niobium%20pentoxide">NbO</a>), +4 (<a href="Niobium%20dioxide">NbO</a>), +3 (), and the rarer oxidation state, +2 (<a href="niobium%20monoxide">NbO</a>). Most common is the pentoxide, precursor to almost all niobium compounds and alloys. Niobates are generated by dissolving the pentoxide in <a href="Base%20%28chemistry%29">basic</a> <a href="hydroxide">hydroxide</a> solutions or by melting it in alkali metal oxides. Examples are <a href="lithium%20niobate">lithium niobate</a> (LiNbO) and lanthanum niobate (LaNbO). In the lithium niobate is a trigonally distorted <a href="Perovskite%20%28structure%29">perovskite</a>-like structure, whereas the lanthanum niobate contains lone ions. The layered niobium sulfide (NbS) is also known.

Materials can be coated with a thin film of niobium(V) oxide <a href="chemical%20vapor%20deposition">chemical vapor deposition</a> or <a href="atomic%20layer%20deposition">atomic layer deposition</a> processes, produced by the thermal decomposition of <a href="niobium%28V%29%20ethoxide">niobium(V) ethoxide</a> above 350 °C.

Niobium forms halides in the oxidation states of +5 and +4 as well as diverse <a href="nonstoichiometric%20compound">substoichiometric compounds</a>. The pentahalides () feature octahedral Nb centres. Niobium pentafluoride (NbF) is a white solid with a melting point of 79.0 °C and <a href="niobium%20pentachloride">niobium pentachloride</a> (NbCl) is yellow (see image at left) with a melting point of 203.4 °C. Both are <a href="hydrolyzed">hydrolyzed</a> to give oxides and oxyhalides, such as NbOCl. The pentachloride is a versatile reagent used to generate the <a href="organometallic">organometallic</a> compounds, such as <a href="niobocene%20dichloride">niobocene dichloride</a> (). The tetrahalides () are dark-coloured polymers with Nb-Nb bonds; for example, the black <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a> niobium tetrafluoride (NbF) and brown niobium tetrachloride (NbCl).

Anionic halide compounds of niobium are well known, owing in part to the <a href="Lewis%20acid">Lewis acid</a>ity of the pentahalides. The most important is [NbF], an intermediate in the separation of Nb and Ta from the ores. This heptafluoride tends to form the oxopentafluoride more readily than does the tantalum compound. Other halide complexes include octahedral [NbCl]:

As with other metals with low atomic numbers, a variety of reduced halide cluster ions is known, the prime example being [NbCl].

Other <a href="binary%20compound">binary compound</a>s of niobium include <a href="niobium%20nitride">niobium nitride</a> (NbN), which becomes a <a href="superconductor">superconductor</a> at low temperatures and is used in detectors for infrared light. The main <a href="niobium%20carbide">niobium carbide</a> is NbC, an extremely <a href="hardness">hard</a>, <a href="refraction%20%28metallurgy%29">refractory</a>, <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a> material, commercially used in cutting <a href="tool%20bit">tool bit</a>s.

Out of 44,500 tonnes of niobium mined in 2006, an estimated 90% was used in high-grade structural steel. The second largest application is <a href="superalloys">superalloys</a>. Niobium alloy superconductors and electronic components account for a very small share of the world production.

Niobium is an effective <a href="Microalloyed%20steel">microalloying</a> element for steel, within which it forms <a href="niobium%20carbide">niobium carbide</a> and <a href="niobium%20nitride">niobium nitride</a>. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, formability, and weldability. Within microalloyed <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a>s, the niobium content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to <a href="HSLA%20steel">high strength low alloy steels</a> that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles. Niobium is sometimes used in considerably higher quantities for highly wear-resistant machine components and knives, as high as 3% in Crucible CPM S110V stainless steel.

These same niobium alloys are often used in pipeline construction.

Quantities of niobium are used in nickel-, <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a>-, and <a href="iron">iron</a>-based <a href="superalloy">superalloy</a>s in proportions as great as 6.5% for such applications as <a href="jet%20engine">jet engine</a> components, <a href="gas%20turbine">gas turbine</a>s, rocket subassemblies, turbo charger systems, heat resisting, and combustion equipment. Niobium precipitates a hardening γ<nowiki>"</nowiki>-phase within the grain structure of the superalloy.

One example superalloy is <a href="inconel">Inconel 718</a>, consisting of roughly 50% <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, 18.6% <a href="chromium">chromium</a>, 18.5% <a href="iron">iron</a>, 5% niobium, 3.1% <a href="molybdenum">molybdenum</a>, 0.9% <a href="titanium">titanium</a>, and 0.4% <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>. These superalloys were used, for example, in advanced air frame systems for the <a href="Gemini%20program">Gemini program</a>. Another niobium alloy was used for the nozzle of the <a href="Apollo%20service%20module">Apollo Service Module</a>. Because niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400 °C, a protective coating is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.

C-103 alloy was developed in the early 1960s jointly by the <a href="Wah%20Chang%20Corporation">Wah Chang Corporation</a> and <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> Co. <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a>, <a href="Union%20Carbide">Union Carbide</a> Corp., <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> Co. and several other companies were developing <a href="Niobium%20alloy">Nb-base alloys</a> simultaneously, largely driven by the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> and <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a>. It is composed of 89% niobium, 10% <a href="hafnium">hafnium</a> and 1% titanium and is used for <a href="liquid%20rocket">liquid rocket</a> thruster nozzles, such as the main engine of the <a href="Apollo%20Lunar%20Module">Apollo Lunar Module</a>s.

The nozzle of the <a href="Merlin%20%28rocket%20engine%20family%29%23Merlin%20Vacuum%20%281C%29">Merlin Vacuum</a> series of engines developed by <a href="SpaceX">SpaceX</a> for the upper stage of its <a href="Falcon%209">Falcon 9</a> rocket is made from a niobium alloy.

The reactivity of niobium with oxygen requires it to be worked in a <a href="Outgassing">vacuum</a> or <a href="Inert%20gas">inert atmosphere</a>, which significantly increases the cost and difficulty of production. <a href="Vacuum%20arc%20remelting">Vacuum arc remelting</a> (VAR) and <a href="electron%20beam%20melting">electron beam melting</a> (EBM), novel processes at the time, enabled the development of niobium and other reactive metals. The project that yielded C-103 began in 1959 with as many as 256 experimental niobium alloys in the "C-series" (possibly from columbium) that could be melted as buttons and rolled into <a href="Sheet%20metal">sheet</a>. Wah Chang had an inventory of hafnium, refined from nuclear-grade <a href="zirconium%20alloy">zirconium alloy</a>s, that it wanted to put to commercial use. The 103rd experimental composition of the C-series alloys, Nb-10Hf-1Ti, had the best combination of formability and high-temperature properties. Wah Chang fabricated the first 500-lb heat of C-103 in 1961, ingot to sheet, using EBM and VAR. The intended applications included <a href="turbine%20engine">turbine engine</a>s and liquid metal <a href="heat%20exchanger">heat exchanger</a>s. Competing niobium alloys from that era included FS85 (Nb-10W-28Ta-1Zr) from Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., Cb129Y (Nb-10W-10Hf-0.2Y) from Wah Chang and Boeing, Cb752 (Nb-10W-2.5Zr) from Union Carbide, and Nb1Zr from Superior Tube Co.

<a href="Niobium-germanium">Niobium-germanium</a> (), <a href="niobium-tin">niobium-tin</a> (), as well as the <a href="niobium-titanium">niobium-titanium</a> <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s are used as a <a href="type%20II%20superconductor">type II superconductor</a> wire for <a href="superconducting%20magnet">superconducting magnet</a>s. These superconducting magnets are used in <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> and <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> instruments as well as in <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s. For example, the <a href="Large%20Hadron%20Collider">Large Hadron Collider</a> uses 600 tons of superconducting strands, while the <a href="International%20Thermonuclear%20Experimental%20Reactor">International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor</a> uses an estimated 600 tonnes of NbSn strands and 250 tonnes of NbTi strands. In 1992 alone, more than US$1 billion worth of clinical magnetic resonance imaging systems were constructed with niobium-titanium wire.

The <a href="superconducting%20radio%20frequency">superconducting radio frequency</a> (SRF) cavities used in the <a href="free-electron%20laser">free-electron laser</a>s <a href="FLASH">FLASH</a> (result of the cancelled TESLA linear accelerator project) and <a href="European%20x-ray%20free%20electron%20laser">XFEL</a> are made from pure niobium. A <a href="cryomodule">cryomodule</a> team at <a href="Fermilab">Fermilab</a> used the same SRF technology from the FLASH project to develop 1.3 GHz nine-cell SRF cavities made from pure niobium. The cavities will be used in the <a href="linear%20particle%20accelerator">linear particle accelerator</a> of the <a href="International%20Linear%20Collider">International Linear Collider</a>. The same technology will be used in <a href="LCLS-II">LCLS-II</a> at <a href="SLAC%20National%20Accelerator%20Laboratory">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> and <a href="PIP-II">PIP-II</a> at Fermilab.

The high sensitivity of superconducting niobium nitride <a href="bolometer">bolometer</a>s make them an ideal detector for <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> in the THz frequency band. These detectors were tested at the <a href="Heinrich%20Hertz%20Submillimeter%20Telescope">Submillimeter Telescope</a>, the <a href="South%20Pole%20Telescope">South Pole Telescope</a>, the <a href="Receiver%20Lab%20Telescope">Receiver Lab Telescope</a>, and at <a href="Atacama%20Pathfinder%20Experiment">APEX</a>, and are now used in the HIFI instrument on board the <a href="Herschel%20Space%20Observatory">Herschel Space Observatory</a>.

<a href="Lithium%20niobate">Lithium niobate</a>, which is a <a href="ferroelectric">ferroelectric</a>, is used extensively in mobile telephones and <a href="optical%20modulators">optical modulators</a>, and for the manufacture of <a href="surface%20acoustic%20wave">surface acoustic wave</a> devices. It belongs to the <a href="Perovskite">ABO</a> structure ferroelectrics like <a href="lithium%20tantalate">lithium tantalate</a> and <a href="barium%20titanate">barium titanate</a>. <a href="Niobium%20capacitor">Niobium capacitor</a>s are available as alternative to <a href="tantalum%20capacitor">tantalum capacitor</a>s, but tantalum capacitors still predominate. Niobium is added to glass to obtain a higher <a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a>, making possible thinner and lighter <a href="glasses">corrective glasses</a>.

Niobium and some niobium alloys are physiologically inert and <a href="hypoallergenic">hypoallergenic</a>. For this reason, niobium is used in prosthetics and implant devices, such as pacemakers. Niobium treated with <a href="sodium%20hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a> forms a porous layer that aids <a href="osseointegration">osseointegration</a>.

Like titanium, tantalum, and aluminium, niobium can be heated and <a href="anodize">anodize</a>d ("reactive metal <a href="anodizing">anodization</a>") to produce a wide array of <a href="Iridescence">iridescent</a> colours for jewelry, where its hypoallergenic property is highly desirable.

Niobium is used as a precious metal in commemorative coins, often with silver or gold. For example, Austria produced a series of silver niobium <a href="euro">euro</a> coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins is created by the <a href="diffraction">diffraction</a> of light by a thin anodized oxide layer. In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow. Two more examples are the 2004 Austrian €25 <a href="Euro%20gold%20and%20silver%20commemorative%20coins%20%28Austria%29%232004%20coinage">150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin</a>, and the 2006 Austrian €25 <a href="Euro%20gold%20and%20silver%20commemorative%20coins%20%28Austria%29%232006%20coinage">European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin</a>.
The Austrian mint produced for Latvia a similar series of coins starting in 2004,
with one following in 2007.
In 2011, the Royal Canadian Mint started production of a $5 <a href="sterling%20silver">sterling silver</a> and niobium coin named "Hunter's Moon"
in which the niobium was selectively oxidized, thus creating unique finishes where no two coins are exactly alike.

The arc-tube seals of high pressure <a href="sodium%20vapor%20lamp">sodium vapor lamp</a>s are made from niobium, sometimes alloyed with 1% of <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a>; niobium has a very similar coefficient of thermal expansion, matching the <a href="sintered">sintered</a> <a href="alumina">alumina</a> <a href="arc%20tube">arc tube</a> ceramic, a translucent material which resists chemical attack or <a href="redox">reduction</a> by the hot liquid sodium and sodium vapour contained inside the operating lamp.

Niobium is used in <a href="arc%20welding">arc welding</a> rods for some stabilized grades of stainless steel and in anodes for cathodic protection systems on some water tanks, which are then usually plated with platinum.

Niobium is an important component of high-performance heterogeneous catalysts for the production of acrylic acid by selective oxidation of propane.

Niobium is used to make the high voltage wire of the <a href="Corona">Solar Corona</a> particles receptor module of the <a href="Parker%20Solar%20Probe">Parker Solar Probe</a> 

Niobium has no known biological role. While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant and a potential fire hazard, elemental niobium on a larger scale is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is frequently used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants.

Niobium-containing compounds are rarely encountered by most people, but some are toxic and should be treated with care. The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a <a href="median%20lethal%20dose">median lethal dose</a> (LD) between 10 and 100 mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD after seven days of 940 mg/kg.

Neville Chamberlain

Arthur Neville Chamberlain (; 18 March 18699 November 1940) was a British <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> statesman who served as <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a> from May 1937 to May 1940. Chamberlain is best known for his foreign policy of <a href="appeasement">appeasement</a>, and in particular for his signing of the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> in 1938, conceding the German-speaking <a href="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a> region of <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> to <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a>. When <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invaded Poland</a>, the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, and Chamberlain led Britain through the <a href="Phoney%20War">first eight months</a> of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

After working in business and local government, and after a short spell as <a href="Director%20of%20National%20Service">Director of National Service</a> in 1916 and 1917, Chamberlain followed his father, <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a>, and older half-brother, <a href="Austen%20Chamberlain">Austen Chamberlain</a>, in becoming a Member of Parliament in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201918">1918 general election</a> for the new <a href="Birmingham_Ladywood_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29%23Elections_in_the_1910s">Birmingham Ladywood</a> division at the age of 49. The campaign in this constituency was notable because his Liberal Party opponent was <a href="Margery_Corbett_Ashby">Mrs Margery Corbett Ashby</a>, one of the seventeen women candidates who ran for a parliament seat at the first opportunity. Chamberlain reacted to this intervention by being one of the few male candidates to specifically target women voters deploying his wife, issuing a special leaflet headed "A word to the Ladies" and holding two meetings in the afternoon. 

He declined a junior ministerial position, remaining a <a href="backbencher">backbencher</a> until 1922. He was rapidly promoted in 1923 to <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Health">Minister of Health</a> and then <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>. After a short-lived <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a>-led government, he returned as Minister of Health, introducing a range of reform measures from 1924 to 1929. He was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the <a href="UK%20National%20Government">National Government</a> in 1931.

When <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a> retired in May 1937, Chamberlain took his place as Prime Minister. His premiership was dominated by the question of policy towards an increasingly aggressive Germany, and his actions at Munich were widely popular among the British at the time. When Hitler continued his aggression, Chamberlain pledged Britain to defend Poland's independence if the latter were attacked, an alliance that brought his country into war when Germany and the <a href="Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact">Soviet Union</a> invaded Poland in 1939. Chamberlain resigned the premiership on 10 May 1940 as the <a href="Norwegian%20Campaign">Allies were being forced to retreat from Norway</a>, as he believed that a government supported by all parties was essential, and the Labour and <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> parties would not join a government he headed. He was succeeded by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> but remained very well regarded in Parliament, especially among Conservatives. Before ill health forced him to resign, he was an important member of Churchill's <a href="War%20Cabinet">War Cabinet</a> as <a href="Lord%20President%20of%20the%20Council">Lord President of the Council</a>, heading the Cabinet in the new premier's absence. Chamberlain died of cancer six months after leaving the premiership.

Chamberlain's reputation remains controversial among historians, the initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as "<a href="Guilty%20Men">Guilty Men</a>", published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain's death held similar views, led by Churchill in "<a href="The%20Second%20World%20War%20%28book%20series%29">The Gathering Storm</a>". Some later historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies, citing government papers released under the <a href="Thirty-year%20rule">Thirty Year Rule</a> and arguing that going to war with Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was unprepared. Nonetheless, Chamberlain is still <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">unfavourably ranked</a> amongst British Prime Ministers.

Chamberlain was born on 18 March 1869 in a house called Southbourne in the <a href="Edgbaston">Edgbaston</a> district of <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>. He was the only son of the second marriage of <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a>, who later became <a href="List%20of%20Lord%20Mayors%20of%20Birmingham">Mayor of Birmingham</a> and a Cabinet minister. His mother was Florence Kenrick, cousin to <a href="William%20Kenrick%20%28Birmingham%20MP%29">William Kenrick MP</a>; she died when he was a small boy. Joseph Chamberlain had had another son, <a href="Austen%20Chamberlain">Austen Chamberlain</a>, by his first marriage. Neville Chamberlain was educated at <a href="Rugby%20School">Rugby School</a>. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to <a href="Mason%20College">Mason College</a> (taking external exams of the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>). Neville Chamberlain had little interest in his studies there, and in 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months he became a salaried employee.

In an effort to recoup diminished family fortunes, Joseph Chamberlain sent his younger son to establish a <a href="sisal">sisal</a> plantation on <a href="Andros%2C%20Bahamas">Andros Island in the Bahamas</a>. Neville Chamberlain spent six years there but the plantation was a failure, and Joseph Chamberlain lost £50,000.

On his return to England, Neville Chamberlain entered business, purchasing (with assistance from his family) Hoskins & Company, a manufacturer of metal ship berths. Chamberlain served as managing director of Hoskins for 17 years during which time the company prospered. He also involved himself in civic activities in Birmingham. In 1906, as Governor of Birmingham's General Hospital, and along with "no more than fifteen" other dignitaries, Chamberlain became a founding member of the national United Hospitals Committee of the <a href="British%20Medical%20Association">British Medical Association</a>. 

At forty, Chamberlain was expecting to remain a bachelor, but in 1910 he fell in love with <a href="Anne%20Chamberlain">Anne Cole</a>, a recent connection by marriage, and married her the following year. They met through his Aunt Lilian, the Canadian-born widow of <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a>'s brother Herbert, who in 1907 had married Anne Cole's uncle <a href="Alfred%20Clayton%20Cole">Alfred Clayton Cole</a>, a director of the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a>.

She encouraged and supported his entry into local politics and was to be his constant companion, helper, and trusted colleague, fully sharing his interests in housing and other political and social activities after his election as an MP. The two had a son and a daughter.

Chamberlain initially showed little interest in politics, though his father and half-brother were in Parliament. During the "<a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201900">Khaki election</a>" of 1900 he made speeches in support of Joseph Chamberlain's <a href="Liberal%20Unionist%20Party">Liberal Unionists</a>. The Liberal Unionists were allied with the Conservatives and later merged with them under the name "Unionist Party", which in 1925 became known as the "Conservative and Unionist Party". In 1911, Neville Chamberlain successfully stood as a Liberal Unionist for <a href="Birmingham%20City%20Council">Birmingham City Council</a> for the All Saints' Ward, located within <a href="Birmingham%20West%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">his father's parliamentary constituency</a>.

Chamberlain was made chairman of the Town Planning Committee. Under his direction, Birmingham soon adopted one of the first town planning schemes in Britain. The start of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans. In 1915, Chamberlain became <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Birmingham">Lord Mayor of Birmingham</a>. Apart from his father Joseph, five of Chamberlain's uncles had also attained the chief Birmingham civic dignity: they were Joseph's brother <a href="Richard%20Chamberlain%20%28MP%20for%20Islington%20West%29">Richard Chamberlain</a>, William and George Kenrick, <a href="Charles%20Gabriel%20Beale">Charles Beale</a>, who had been four times Lord Mayor and <a href="Martineau%20family">Sir Thomas Martineau</a>. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard. He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent. In 1915, Chamberlain was appointed a member of the Central Control Board on liquor traffic.

In December 1916, Prime Minister <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> offered Chamberlain the new position of <a href="Director%20of%20National%20Service">Director of National Service</a>, with responsibility for co-ordinating <a href="conscription">conscription</a> and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. His tenure was marked by conflict with Lloyd George; in August 1917, having received little support from the Prime Minister, Chamberlain resigned. The relationship between Chamberlain and Lloyd George would thenceforth be one of hatred.

Chamberlain decided to stand for the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, and was adopted as Unionist candidate for <a href="Birmingham%20Ladywood%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Birmingham Ladywood</a>. After the war ended, <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201918">a general election</a> was called almost immediately. Chamberlain was elected with almost 70% of the vote and a majority of 6,833. He was 49 years old, which remains to date the greatest age at which any future Prime Minister has first been elected to the Commons.

Chamberlain threw himself into parliamentary work, begrudging the times when he was unable to attend debates and spending much time on committee work. He was chairman of the national Unhealthy Areas Committee (1919–21) and in that role, had visited the slums of London, Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Cardiff. Consequently, in March 1920, <a href="Bonar%20Law">Bonar Law</a> offered him a junior post at the <a href="Department%20of%20Health%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Health</a> on behalf of the Prime Minister, but Chamberlain was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George and was offered no further posts during Lloyd George's premiership. When Bonar Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament. Unionist leaders were willing to fight the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201922">1922 election</a> in coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals, but on 19 October, Unionist MPs held <a href="Carlton%20Club%20meeting%2C%2019%20October%201922">a meeting</a> at which they voted to fight the election as a single party. Lloyd George resigned, as did Austen Chamberlain, and Bonar Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as Prime Minister.

Many high-ranking Unionists refused to serve under Bonar Law to the benefit of Chamberlain, who rose over the course of ten months from backbencher to Chancellor of the Exchequer. Bonar Law initially appointed Chamberlain <a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Postmaster General</a> and Chamberlain was sworn of the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a>. When Sir <a href="Arthur%20Griffith-Boscawen">Arthur Griffith-Boscawen</a>, the Minister of Health, lost his seat in the 1922 election and failed to win a by-election in March 1923, Bonar Law offered the position to Chamberlain. Two months later, Bonar Law was diagnosed with advanced, terminal <a href="throat%20cancer">throat cancer</a>. He immediately resigned and was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a>. In August 1923, Baldwin promoted Chamberlain to the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Chamberlain served only five months in the office before the Conservatives were defeated in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201923">1923 general election</a>. <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a> became the first Labour Prime Minister, but his government fell within months, necessitating <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201924">another general election</a>. By a margin of only 77 votes, Chamberlain narrowly defeated Labour candidate <a href="Oswald%20Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a> (who later led the <a href="British%20Union%20of%20Fascists">British Union of Fascists</a>). Believing he would lose if he stood again in Birmingham Ladywood, Chamberlain arranged to be adopted for <a href="Birmingham%20Edgbaston%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Birmingham Edgbaston</a>, the district of the city where he was born and which was a much safer seat, which he would hold for the rest of his life. The Unionists won the election, but Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor, preferring his former position as Minister of Health.

Within two weeks of his appointment as Minister of Health, Chamberlain presented the Cabinet with an agenda containing 25 pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted. Before he left office in 1929, 21 of the 25 bills had passed into law. Chamberlain sought the abolition of the elected <a href="Poor%20Law">Poor Law</a> <a href="Boards%20of%20Guardians">Boards of Guardians</a> which administered relief—and which in some areas were responsible for <a href="rates%20%28tax%29">rates</a>. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and such Boards had defied the government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. In 1929, Chamberlain initiated legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons for two and a half hours on the <a href="second%20reading">second reading</a> of the Bill, and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties. The Bill passed into law.

Though Chamberlain struck a conciliatory note during the <a href="UK%20General%20Strike%20of%201926">1926 General Strike</a>, in general he had poor relations with the Labour opposition. Future Labour Prime Minister <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> complained that Chamberlain "always treated us like dirt," and in April 1927 Chamberlain wrote: "More and more do I feel an utter contempt for their lamentable "stupidity"." His poor relations with the Labour Party later played a major part in his downfall as Prime Minister.

Baldwin called <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201929">a general election</a> for 30 May 1929, resulting in a <a href="hung%20parliament">hung parliament</a> with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour, under MacDonald, again took office. In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis as the <a href="May%20Report">May Report</a> revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of £120 million. The Labour government resigned on 24 August, and MacDonald formed a <a href="National%20Government%20%281931%29">National Government</a> supported by most Conservative MPs. Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health.

After the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201931">1931 general election</a>, in which supporters of the National Government (mostly Conservatives) won an overwhelming victory, MacDonald designated Chamberlain as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Chamberlain proposed a 10% tariff on foreign goods and lower or no tariffs on goods from the colonies and the <a href="Dominions">Dominions</a>. Joseph Chamberlain had advocated a similar policy, "<a href="Imperial%20Preference">Imperial Preference</a>"; Neville Chamberlain laid his bill before the House of Commons on 4 February 1932, and concluded his address by noting the appropriateness of his seeking to enact his father's proposal. At the end of the speech, Sir Austen Chamberlain walked down from the backbenches and shook his brother's hand. The <a href="Import%20Duties%20Act%201932">Import Duties Act 1932</a> passed Parliament easily.

Chamberlain presented his first budget in April 1932. He maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed at the inception of the National Government. Interest on the war debt was a major cost. Chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on <a href="War%20bond%23United%20Kingdom">most of Britain's war debt</a> from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to interest on the war debt.

Chamberlain hoped that a cancellation of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated. In June 1933, Britain hosted the <a href="London%20Economic%20Conference">World Monetary and Economic Conference</a>, which came to nothing as US President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> sent word that he would not consider any war <a href="debt%20relief">debt cancellation</a>. By 1934, Chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus and restore many of the cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant salaries he had made after taking office. He told the Commons, "We have now finished the story of "<a href="Bleak%20House">Bleak House</a>" and are sitting down this afternoon to enjoy the first chapter of "<a href="Great%20Expectations">Great Expectations</a>"."

The Unemployed Assistance Board (UAB, established by the <a href="Unemployment%20Act%201934">Unemployment Act 1934</a>) was largely Chamberlain's creation, and he wished to see the issue of unemployment assistance removed from party political argument. Moreover, Chamberlain "saw the importance of 'providing some interest in life for the large numbers of men never likely to get work', and out of this realisation was to come the responsibility of the UAB for the 'welfare', not merely the maintenance, of the unemployed."

Defence spending had been heavily cut in Chamberlain's early budgets. By 1935, faced with a resurgent Germany under Hitler's leadership (see <a href="German%20re-armament">German re-armament</a>), he was convinced of the need for rearmament. Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, realising that Britain's historical bulwark, the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, was no defence against air power.

In 1935, MacDonald stood down as Prime Minister, and Baldwin became Prime Minister for the third time. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 general election</a>, the Conservative-dominated National Government lost 90 seats from its massive 1931 majority, but still retained an overwhelming majority of 255 in the House of Commons. During the campaign, deputy Labour leader <a href="Arthur%20Greenwood">Arthur Greenwood</a> had attacked Chamberlain for spending money on rearmament, saying that the rearmament policy was "the merest scaremongering; disgraceful in a statesman of Mr Chamberlain's responsible position, to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments."

Chamberlain is believed to have had a significant role in the 1936 <a href="Edward%20VIII%20abdication%20crisis">abdication crisis</a>. He wrote in his diary that <a href="Wallis%20Simpson">Wallis Simpson</a>, Edward VIII's intended wife, was "an entirely unscrupulous woman who is not in love with the King but is exploiting him for her own purposes. She has already ruined him in money and jewels ..." In common with the rest of the Cabinet, except <a href="Duff%20Cooper">Duff Cooper</a>, he agreed with Baldwin that the King should abdicate if he married Simpson, and on 6 December he and Baldwin both stressed that the King should make his decision before Christmas; by one account, he believed that the uncertainty was "hurting the Christmas trade". The King abdicated on 10 December, four days after the meeting.

Soon after the abdication, Baldwin announced that he would remain until shortly after the <a href="coronation%20of%20King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth">coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth</a>. On 28 May, two weeks after the Coronation, Baldwin resigned, advising the King to send for Chamberlain. Sir Austen did not live to see his brother's final "climb ... to the top of the greasy pole," having died two months earlier.

Upon his accession Chamberlain considered calling a general election, but with three and a half years remaining in the current Parliament's term he decided to wait. At age 68, he was the second-eldest person in the 20th century (behind Sir <a href="Henry%20Campbell-Bannerman">Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a>) to become Prime Minister for the first time, and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election and then step down in favour of a younger man, with Foreign Secretary <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a> a likely candidate. From the start of Chamberlain's premiership a number of would-be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position.

Chamberlain had disliked what he considered to be the overly sentimental attitude of both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles. Although he had worked closely with the <a href="President%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Trade">President of the Board of Trade</a>, <a href="Walter%20Runciman%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Runciman%20of%20Doxford">Walter Runciman</a>, on the tariff issue, Chamberlain dismissed him from his post, instead offering him the token position of <a href="Lord%20Privy%20Seal">Lord Privy Seal</a>, which an angry Runciman declined. Chamberlain thought Runciman, a member of the Liberal National Party, to be lazy. Soon after taking office, Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two-year policy programmes. These reports were to be integrated with the intent of co-ordinating the passage of legislation through the current Parliament, the term of which was to expire in November 1940.

At the time of his succession Chamberlain's personality was not well known to the public, though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years. According to Chamberlain biographer Robert Self, these appeared relaxed and modern, showing an ability to speak directly to the camera. Chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues; an attempt by his <a href="Parliamentary%20Private%20Secretary%20to%20the%20Prime%20Minister">Parliamentary Private Secretary</a>, Lord Dunglass (later Prime Minister himself as <a href="Alec%20Douglas-Home">Alec Douglas-Home</a>), to bring him to the Commons Smoking Room to socialise with colleagues ended in embarrassing silence. Chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising the most sophisticated <a href="spin%20doctor">press management system</a> employed by a Prime Minister up to that time, with officials at <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">Number 10</a>, led by his chief of press George Steward, convincing members of the press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge, and should espouse the government line.

Chamberlain saw his elevation to the premiership as the final glory in a career as a domestic reformer, not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions. One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was the hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs.

Soon after attaining the premiership, Chamberlain obtained passage of the Factories Act 1937. This Act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories, and placed limits on the working hours of women and children. In 1938, Parliament enacted the <a href="Coal%20Act%201938">Coal Act 1938</a>, which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits. Another major law passed that year was the <a href="Holiday%20Pay%20Act%201938">Holidays with Pay Act</a>. Though the Act only recommended that employers give workers a week off with pay, it led to a great expansion of <a href="holiday%20camp">holiday camp</a>s and other leisure accommodation for the working classes. The Housing Act of 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging <a href="slum%20clearance">slum clearance</a> and maintained <a href="rent%20control">rent control</a>. Chamberlain's plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in 1939. Likewise, the raising of the school-leaving age to 15, scheduled for implementation on 1 September 1939, did not go into effect.

Relations between the United Kingdom and the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> had been strained since the 1932 appointment of <a href="%C3%89amon%20de%20Valera">Éamon de Valera</a> as <a href="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> (Prime Minister). The <a href="Anglo-Irish%20Trade%20War">Anglo-Irish Trade War</a>, sparked by the withholding of money that Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom, had caused economic losses on both sides, and the two nations were anxious for a settlement. The de Valera government also sought to sever the remaining ties between Ireland and the UK, such as ending the King's status as Irish Head of State. As Chancellor, Chamberlain had taken a hard-line stance against concessions to the Irish, but as premier sought a settlement with Ireland, being persuaded that the strained ties were affecting relations with other Dominions.

Talks had been suspended under Baldwin in 1936 but resumed in November 1937. De Valera sought not only to alter the constitutional status of Ireland, but to overturn other aspects of the <a href="Anglo-Irish%20Treaty">Anglo-Irish Treaty</a>, most notably the issue of <a href="Partition%20of%20Ireland">partition</a>, as well as obtaining full control of the three "<a href="Treaty%20Ports%20%28Ireland%29">Treaty Ports</a>" which had remained in British control. Britain, on the other hand, wished to retain the Treaty Ports, at least in time of war, and to obtain the money that Ireland had agreed to pay.

The Irish proved very tough negotiators, so much so that Chamberlain complained that one of de Valera's offers had "presented United Kingdom ministers with a three-leafed shamrock, none of the leaves of which had any advantages for the UK." With the talks facing deadlock, Chamberlain made the Irish a final offer in March 1938 which acceded to many Irish positions, though he was confident that he had "only given up the small things," and the agreements were signed on 25 April 1938. The issue of partition was not resolved, but the Irish agreed to pay £10 million to the British. There was no provision in the treaties for British access to the Treaty Ports in time of war, but Chamberlain accepted de Valera's oral assurance that in the event of war the British would have access. Conservative backbencher <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> attacked the agreements in Parliament for surrendering the Treaty Ports, which he described as the "sentinel towers of the Western Approaches". When war came, de Valera denied Britain access to the Treaty Ports under <a href="Irish%20neutrality">Irish neutrality</a>. Churchill railed against these treaties in "<a href="The%20Second%20World%20War%20%28book%20series%29">The Gathering Storm</a>", stating that he "never saw the House of Commons more completely misled" and that "members were made to feel very differently about it when our existence hung in the balance during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a>." Chamberlain believed that the Treaty Ports were unusable if Ireland was hostile, and deemed their loss worthwhile to assure friendly relations with Dublin.

Chamberlain sought to conciliate Germany and make the Nazi state a partner in a stable Europe. He believed Germany could be satisfied by the restoration of some of her colonies, and during the <a href="Remilitarization%20of%20the%20Rhineland">Rhineland crisis</a> of March 1936 he had stated that "if we were in sight of an all-round settlement the British government ought to consider the question" of restoration of colonies.

The new Prime Minister's attempts to secure such a settlement were frustrated because Germany was in no hurry to talk to Britain. Foreign Minister <a href="Konstantin%20von%20Neurath">Konstantin von Neurath</a> was supposed to visit Britain in July 1937 but cancelled his visit. <a href="E.%20F.%20L.%20Wood%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Halifax">Lord Halifax</a>, the <a href="Lord%20President%20of%20the%20Council">Lord President of the Council</a>, visited Germany privately in November and met Hitler and other German officials. Both Chamberlain and British Ambassador to Germany <a href="Nevile%20Henderson">Nevile Henderson</a> pronounced the visit a success. Foreign Office officials complained that the Halifax visit made it appear Britain was too eager for talks, and the Foreign Secretary, <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a>, felt that he had been bypassed.

Chamberlain also bypassed Eden while the Foreign Secretary was on holiday by opening direct talks with Italy, an international pariah for its <a href="Second%20Italo-Abyssinian%20War">invasion and conquest</a> of <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. At a Cabinet meeting on 8 September 1937, Chamberlain indicated that he saw "the lessening of the tension between this country and Italy as a very valuable contribution toward the pacification and appeasement of Europe" which would "weaken the <a href="Axis%20powers">Rome–Berlin axis</a>." The Prime Minister also set up a private line of communication with the Italian "Duce" <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> through the Italian Ambassador, Count <a href="Dino%20Grandi">Dino Grandi</a>.

In February 1938, Hitler began to press the Austrian government to accept "<a href="Anschluss">Anschluß</a>," or union between Germany and Austria. Chamberlain believed that it was essential to cement relations with Italy in the hope that an Anglo–Italian alliance would forestall Hitler from imposing his rule over Austria. Eden believed that Chamberlain was being too hasty in talking with Italy and holding out the prospect of "<a href="de%20jure">de jure</a>" recognition of Italy's conquest of Ethiopia. Chamberlain concluded that Eden would have to accept his policy or resign. The Cabinet heard both men out but unanimously decided for Chamberlain, and despite efforts by other Cabinet members to prevent it, Eden resigned from office. In later years, Eden tried to portray his resignation as a stand against appeasement (Churchill described him in "<a href="The%20Second%20World%20War%20%28book%20series%29">The Second World War</a>" as "one strong young figure standing up against long, dismal, drawling tides of drift and surrender") but many ministers and MPs believed there was no issue at stake worth resignation. Chamberlain appointed Lord Halifax as Foreign Secretary in Eden's place.

In March 1938 Austria became a part of Germany in the "Anschluß". Though the beleaguered Austrians requested help from Britain, none was forthcoming. Britain did send Berlin a strong note of protest. In addressing the Cabinet shortly after German forces crossed the border, Chamberlain placed blame on both Germany and Austria. Chamberlain noted,

On 14 March, the day after the "Anschluß," Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons and strongly condemned the methods used by the Germans in the takeover of Austria. Chamberlain's address met with the approval of the House.
With Austria absorbed by Germany, attention turned to Hitler's obvious next target, the <a href="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a> region of Czechoslovakia. With three million ethnic Germans, the Sudetenland represented the largest German population outside the "Reich" and Hitler began to call for the union of the region with Germany. Britain had no military obligations toward Czechoslovakia, but France and Czechoslovakia had a mutual assistance pact and both the French and Czechoslovaks also had an alliance with the Soviet Union. After the fall of Austria, the Cabinet's Foreign Policy Committee considered seeking a "grand alliance" to thwart Germany or, alternatively, an assurance to France of assistance if the French went to war. Instead, the committee chose to advocate that Czechoslovakia be urged to make the best terms it could with Germany. The full Cabinet agreed with the committee's recommendation, influenced by a report from the chiefs of staff stating that there was little that Britain could do to help the Czechs in the event of a German invasion. Chamberlain reported to an amenable House that he was unwilling to limit his government's discretion by giving commitments.

Britain and Italy signed an agreement in April 1938. In exchange for "<a href="de%20jure">de jure</a>" recognition of Italy's Ethiopian conquest, Italy agreed to withdraw some Italian "volunteers" from the Nationalist (pro-<a href="Francisco%20Franco">Franco</a>) side of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. By this point, the Nationalists strongly had the upper hand in that conflict, and they completed their victory the following year. Later that month, the new French Prime Minister, <a href="%C3%89douard%20Daladier">Édouard Daladier</a>, came to London for talks with Chamberlain, and agreed to follow the British position on Czechoslovakia.

In May, Czech border guards shot two Sudeten German farmers who were trying to cross the border from Germany into Czechoslovakia without stopping for border controls. This incident caused unrest among the Sudeten Germans, and Germany was then said to be moving troops to the border. In response to the report, Prague moved troops to the German border. Halifax sent a note to Germany warning that if France intervened in the crisis on Czechoslovakia's behalf, Britain might support France. Tensions appeared to calm, and Chamberlain and Halifax were applauded for their "masterly" handling of the crisis. Though it was not known at the time, it later became clear that Germany had had no plans for a May invasion of Czechoslovakia. Nonetheless, the Chamberlain government received strong and almost unanimous support from the British press.

Negotiations between the Czech government and the Sudeten Germans dragged on through mid-1938. They achieved little result; Sudeten leader <a href="Konrad%20Henlein">Konrad Henlein</a> was under private instructions from Hitler not to reach an agreement. On 3 August, Walter Runciman (by now Lord Runciman) travelled to Prague as a <a href="Runciman%20Mission">mediator</a> sent by the British government. Over the next two weeks, Runciman met separately with Henlein, Czechoslovak President <a href="Edvard%20Bene%C5%A1">Edvard Beneš</a>, and other leaders, but made no progress. On 30 August. Chamberlain met his Cabinet and Ambassador Henderson and secured their backing—with only <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="Duff%20Cooper">Duff Cooper</a> dissenting against Chamberlain's policy to pressure Czechoslovakia into making concessions, on the ground that Britain was then in no position to back up any threat to go to war.

Chamberlain realised that Hitler would likely signal his intentions in his 12 September speech at the annual <a href="Nuremberg%20Rally">Nuremberg Rally</a>, and so the Prime Minister discussed with his advisors how to respond if war seemed likely. In consultation with his close advisor Sir <a href="Horace%20Wilson%20%28civil%20servant%29">Horace Wilson</a>, Chamberlain set out "Plan Z". If war seemed inevitable, Chamberlain would fly to Germany to negotiate directly with Hitler.

Lord Runciman continued his work, attempting to pressure the Czechoslovak government into concessions. On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North Moravian city of <a href="Ostrava">Ostrava</a> ("Mährisch-Ostrau" in German). The Germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident, though the Prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved. As the tempest grew, Runciman concluded that there was no point in attempting further negotiations until after Hitler's speech. The mission never resumed.

There was tremendous tension in the final days before Hitler's speech on the last day of the Rally, as Britain, France, and Czechoslovakia all partially mobilised their troops. Thousands gathered outside 10 Downing Street on the night of the speech. At last Hitler addressed his wildly enthusiastic followers:

The following morning, 13 September, Chamberlain and the Cabinet were informed by Secret Service sources that all German embassies had been told that Germany would invade Czechoslovakia on 25 September. Convinced that the French would not fight (Daladier was privately proposing a three-Power summit to settle the Sudeten question), Chamberlain decided to implement "Plan Z" and sent a message to Hitler that he was willing to come to Germany to negotiate. Hitler accepted and Chamberlain flew to Germany on the morning of 15 September; this was the first time, excepting a short jaunt at an industrial fair, that Chamberlain had ever flown. Chamberlain flew to Munich and then travelled by rail to Hitler's retreat at <a href="Berchtesgaden">Berchtesgaden</a>.

The face to face meeting lasted about three hours. Hitler demanded the annexation of the Sudetenland, and through questioning him, Chamberlain was able to obtain assurances that Hitler had no designs on the remainder of Czechoslovakia or on the areas in Eastern Europe which had German minorities. After the meeting Chamberlain returned to London, believing that he had obtained a breathing space during which agreement could be reached and the peace preserved. Under the proposals made at Berchtesgaden the Sudetenland would be annexed by Germany if a plebiscite in the Sudetenland favoured it. Czechoslovakia would receive international guarantees of its independence which would replace existing treaty obligations—principally the French pledge to the Czechoslovaks. The French agreed to the requirements. Under considerable pressure the Czechoslovaks also agreed, causing the Czechoslovak government to fall.

Chamberlain flew back to Germany, meeting Hitler in <a href="Bad%20Godesberg">Bad Godesberg</a> on 22 September. Hitler brushed aside the proposals of the previous meeting, saying "that won't do any more". Hitler demanded immediate occupation of the Sudetenland and that Polish and Hungarian territorial claims on Czechoslovakia be addressed. Chamberlain objected strenuously, telling Hitler that he had worked to bring the French and Czechoslovaks into line with Germany's demands, so much so that he had been accused of giving in to dictators and had been booed on his departure that morning. Hitler was unmoved.

That evening, Chamberlain told Lord Halifax that the "meeting with Herr Hitler had been most unsatisfactory". The following day, Hitler kept Chamberlain waiting until mid-afternoon, when he sent a five-page letter, in German, outlining the demands he had made orally the previous day. Chamberlain replied by offering to act as an intermediary with the Czechoslovaks, and suggested that Hitler put his demands in a memorandum which could be circulated to the French and Czechoslovaks.

The leaders met again late on the evening of 23 September—a meeting which stretched into the early morning hours. Hitler demanded that fleeing Czechs in the zones to be occupied take nothing with them. He extended his deadline for occupation of the Sudetenland to 1 October—the date he had long before secretly set for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. The meeting ended amicably, with Chamberlain confiding to Hitler his hopes they would be able to work out other problems in Europe in the same spirit. Hitler hinted that the Sudetenland fulfilled his territorial ambitions in Europe. Chamberlain flew back to London, saying "It is up to the Czechs now."

Hitler's proposals met with resistance not only from the French and Czechoslovaks, but also from some members of Chamberlain's cabinet. With no agreement in sight, war seemed inevitable. The Prime Minister issued a press statement calling on Germany to abandon the threat of force in exchange for British help in obtaining the concessions it sought. On the evening of 27 September, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, and after thanking those who wrote to him, stated:

On 28 September, Chamberlain called on Hitler to invite him to Germany again to seek a solution through a summit involving the British, French, Germans, and Italians. Hitler replied favourably, and word of this response came to Chamberlain as he was winding up a speech in <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201935">the House of Commons</a> which sat in gloomy anticipation of war. Chamberlain informed the House of this in his speech. The response was a passionate demonstration, with members cheering Chamberlain wildly. Even diplomats in the galleries applauded. Lord Dunglass later commented, "There were a lot of appeasers in Parliament that day."

On the morning of 29 September Chamberlain left <a href="Heston%20Aerodrome">Heston Aerodrome</a> (to the east of today's <a href="Heathrow%20Airport">Heathrow Airport</a>) for his third and final visit to Germany. On arrival in Munich the British delegation was taken directly to the <a href="Hochschule%20f%C3%BCr%20Musik%20und%20Theater%20M%C3%BCnchen">"Führerbau"</a>, where Daladier, <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Mussolini</a>, and Hitler soon arrived. The four leaders and their translators held an informal meeting; Hitler said that he intended to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October. Mussolini distributed a proposal similar to Hitler's Bad Godesberg terms. In reality, the proposal had been drafted by German officials and transmitted to Rome the previous day. The four leaders debated the draft and Chamberlain raised the question of compensation for the Czechoslovak government and citizens, but Hitler refused to consider this.

The leaders were joined by advisors after lunch, and hours were spent on long discussions of each clause of the "Italian" draft agreement. Late that evening the British and French left for their hotels, saying that they had to seek advice from their respective capitals. Meanwhile, the Germans and Italians enjoyed the feast which Hitler had intended for all the participants. During this break, Chamberlain advisor <a href="Horace%20Wilson%20%28civil%20servant%29">Sir Horace Wilson</a> met with the Czechoslovaks; he informed them of the draft agreement and asked which districts were particularly important to them. The conference resumed at about 10 pm and was mostly in the hands of a small drafting committee. At 1:30 am the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> was ready for signing, though the signing ceremony was delayed when Hitler discovered that the ornate inkwell on his desk was empty.

Chamberlain and Daladier returned to their hotel and informed the Czechoslovaks of the agreement. The two Prime Ministers urged quick acceptance by the Czechoslovaks of the agreement, since the evacuation by the Czechs was to begin the following day. At 12:30 pm the Czechoslovak government in Prague objected to the decision but agreed to its terms.

Before leaving the ""Führerbau"," Chamberlain requested a private conference with Hitler. Hitler agreed, and the two met at Hitler's apartment in the city later that morning. Chamberlain urged restraint in the implementation of the agreement and requested that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs resisted, to which Hitler seemed agreeable. Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed "Anglo–German Agreement," which contained three paragraphs, including a statement that the two nations considered the Munich Agreement "symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war again." According to Chamberlain, Hitler interjected ""Ja! Ja!"" ("Yes! Yes!") as the Prime Minister read it. The two men signed the paper then and there. When, later that day, German Foreign Minister <a href="Joachim%20von%20Ribbentrop">Joachim von Ribbentrop</a> remonstrated with Hitler for signing it, the Führer replied, "Oh, don't take it so seriously. That piece of paper is of no further significance whatever." Chamberlain, on the other hand, patted his breast pocket when he returned to his hotel for lunch and said, "I've got it!" Word leaked of the outcome of the meetings before Chamberlain's return, causing delight among many in London but gloom for Churchill and his supporters.

Chamberlain returned to London in triumph. Large crowds mobbed Heston, where he was met by the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a>, <a href="George%20Villiers%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Clarendon">the Earl of Clarendon</a>, who gave him a letter from <a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a> assuring him of the Empire's lasting gratitude and urging him to come straight to Buckingham Palace to report. The streets were so packed with cheering people that it took Chamberlain an hour and a half to journey the nine miles (14 km) from Heston to the Palace. After reporting to the King, Chamberlain and his wife appeared on the Palace balcony with the King and <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen</a>. He then went to Downing Street; both the street and the front hall of Number 10 were packed. As he headed upstairs to address the crowd from a first-floor window, someone called to him, "Neville, go up to the window and say 'peace for our time'." Chamberlain turned around and responded, "No, I don't do that sort of thing." Nevertheless, in his statement to the crowd, Chamberlain recalled the words of his predecessor, <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>, upon the latter's return from the <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a>:

King George issued a statement to his people, "After the magnificent efforts of the Prime Minister in the cause of peace it is my fervent hope that a new era of friendship and prosperity may be dawning among the peoples of the world." When the King met <a href="Duff%20Cooper">Duff Cooper</a>, who resigned as <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> over the Munich Agreement, he told Cooper that he respected people who had the courage of their convictions, but could not agree with him. He wrote to his mother, <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a>, that "the Prime Minister was delighted with the results of his mission, as are we all." The dowager queen responded to her son with anger against those who spoke against the Prime Minister: "He brought home peace, why can't they be grateful?" Most newspapers supported Chamberlain uncritically, and he received thousands of gifts, from a silver dinner service to many of his trademark umbrellas.

The Commons discussed the Munich Agreement on 3 October. Though Cooper opened by setting forth the reasons for his resignation and Churchill spoke harshly against the pact, no Conservative voted against the government. Only between 20 and 30 abstained, including Churchill, Eden, Cooper, and <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>.

In the aftermath of Munich, Chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament. He told the Cabinet in early October 1938, "<nowiki>[I]</nowiki>t would be madness for the country to stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in the same way. For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good." Later in October, he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing, convinced that such an action would show Hitler that the Prime Minister had decided to abandon Munich. Chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with Hitler at Munich would lead toward a general settlement of European disputes, but Hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord. Having considered a general election immediately following Munich, Chamberlain instead <a href="Cabinet%20shuffle">reshuffled his Cabinet</a>. By the end of the year, public concerns caused Chamberlain to conclude that "to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled House of Commons by a General Election" would be "suicidal".

Despite Hitler's relative quietness as the "Reich" absorbed the Sudetenland, foreign policy concerns continued to preoccupy Chamberlain. He made trips to Paris and Rome, hoping to persuade the French to hasten their rearmament and Mussolini to be a positive influence on Hitler. Several of his Cabinet members, led by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, began to draw away from the appeasement policy. Halifax was by now convinced that Munich, though "better than a European war," had been "a horrid business and humiliating". Public revulsion over the pogrom of "<a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>" on 9 November 1938 made any attempt at a "rapprochement" with Hitler unacceptable, though Chamberlain did not abandon his hopes.

Still hoping for reconciliation with Germany, Chamberlain made a major speech in Birmingham on 28 January 1939, in which he expressed his desire for international peace, and had an advance copy sent to Hitler at Berchtesgaden. Hitler seemed to respond; in his "<a href="Reichstag%20%28Weimar%20Republic%29">Reichstag</a>" speech on 30 January 1939, he stated that he wanted a "long peace". Chamberlain was confident that improvements in British defence since Munich would bring the dictator to the bargaining table. This belief was reinforced by a German official's conciliatory speech welcoming Ambassador Henderson back to Berlin after an absence for medical treatment in Britain. Chamberlain responded with a speech in <a href="Blackburn">Blackburn</a> on 22 February hoping that the nations would resolve their differences through trade, and was gratified when his comments were printed in German newspapers. With matters appearing to improve, Chamberlain's rule over the House of Commons was firm and he was convinced the government would "romp home" in a late 1939 election.

On 15 March 1939, Germany invaded the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, including Prague. Though Chamberlain's initial parliamentary response was, according to biographer Nick Smart, "feeble," within 48 hours he had spoken more forcefully against the German aggression. In another Birmingham speech, on 17 March, Chamberlain warned that "no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thing the nation has so lost its fibre that it will not take part to the utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it were ever made." The Prime Minister questioned whether the invasion of Czechoslovakia was "the end of an old adventure, or the beginning of a new" and whether it was "a step in the direction of an attempt to dominate the world by force." <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Colonies">Colonial Secretary</a> <a href="Malcolm%20MacDonald">Malcolm MacDonald</a> said, "whereas the Prime Minister was once a strong advocate of peace, he has now definitely swung around to the war point of view." This speech was met with widespread approval in Britain and recruitment for the armed services increased considerably.

Chamberlain set out to build an interlocking series of defence pacts among the remaining European countries as a means of deterring Hitler from war. He sought an agreement among Britain, France, the USSR, and Poland, whereby the first three would go to the assistance of Poland if her independence were threatened, but Polish mistrust of the Soviet Union caused those negotiations to fail. Instead, on 31 March 1939, Chamberlain informed an approving House of Commons of <a href="Anglo-Polish%20military%20alliance">British and</a> <a href="Franco-Polish%20military%20alliance">French guarantees</a> that they would lend Poland all possible aid in the event of any action which threatened Polish independence. In the ensuing debate, Eden stated that the nation was now united behind the government. Even Churchill and Lloyd George praised Chamberlain's government for issuing the guarantee to Poland.

The Prime Minister took other steps to deter Hitler from aggression. He doubled the size of the <a href="Territorial%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a>, created a <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a> to expedite the provision of equipment to the armed forces, and instituted peacetime conscription. The <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Albania">Italian invasion of Albania</a> on 7 April 1939 led to guarantees being given to Greece and Romania. On 17 June 1939, <a href="Handley%20Page">Handley Page</a> received an order for 200 <a href="Handley%20Page%20Hampden">Hampden</a> twin-engined medium bombers, and by 3 September 1939, the chain of radar stations girdling the British coast was fully operational.

Chamberlain was reluctant to seek a military alliance with the Soviet Union; he distrusted <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> ideologically and felt that there was little to gain, given the recent massive purges in the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>. Much of his Cabinet favoured such an alliance, and when Poland withdrew her objection to an Anglo–Soviet alliance, Chamberlain had little choice but to proceed. The talks with Soviet Foreign Minister <a href="Vyacheslav%20Molotov">Vyacheslav Molotov</a>, to which Britain sent only a low-level delegation, dragged on over several months and eventually foundered on 14 August 1939 when Poland and Romania refused to allow Soviet troops to be stationed on their territories. A week after the failure of these talks, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the <a href="Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact">Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</a>, committing the countries to non-aggression toward each other. A secret agreement divided up Poland in the event of war. Chamberlain had disregarded rumours of a Soviet–German "rapprochement" and was dismissive of the publicly announced pact, stating that it in no way affected British obligations toward Poland. On 23 August 1939, Chamberlain had Henderson deliver a letter to Hitler telling him that Britain was fully prepared to comply with its obligations to Poland. Hitler instructed his generals to prepare for <a href="Fall%20Weiss%20%281939%29">an invasion of Poland</a>, telling them, "Our enemies are small worms. I saw them at Munich."

Germany <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">invaded Poland</a> in the early morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish territory Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00 pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader <a href="Arthur%20Greenwood">Arthur Greenwood</a> (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.

No formal declaration of war was immediately made. French Foreign Minister <a href="Georges%20Bonnet">Georges Bonnet</a> stated that France could do nothing until its parliament met on the evening of 2 September. Bonnet was trying to rally support for a Munich-style summit proposed by the Italians to be held on 5 September. The British Cabinet demanded that Hitler be given an ultimatum at once, and if troops were not withdrawn by the end of 2 September, that war be declared forthwith. Chamberlain and Halifax were convinced by Bonnet's pleas from Paris that France needed more time for mobilisation and evacuation, and postponed the expiry of the ultimatum (which had in fact not yet been served). Chamberlain's lengthy statement to the House of Commons made no mention of an ultimatum, and the House received it badly. When Greenwood rose to "speak for the working classes," Conservative backbencher <a href="Leo%20Amery">Leo Amery</a> urged him, "Speak for England, Arthur," implying that the Prime Minister was not doing so. Chamberlain replied that telephone difficulties were making it hard to communicate with Paris and tried to dispel fears that the French were weakening. He had little success; too many members knew of Bonnet's efforts. National Labour MP and diarist <a href="Harold%20Nicolson">Harold Nicolson</a> later wrote, "In those few minutes he flung away his reputation." The seeming delay gave rise to fears that Chamberlain would again seek a settlement with Hitler. Chamberlain's last peacetime Cabinet met at 11:30 that night, with a thunderstorm raging outside, and determined that the ultimatum would be presented in Berlin at nine o'clock the following morning—to expire two hours later, before the House of Commons convened at noon. At 11:15 am, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, stating that the United Kingdom was at war with Germany:

That afternoon Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons' first Sunday session in over 120 years. He spoke to a quiet House in a statement which even opponents termed "restrained and therefore effective":

Chamberlain instituted a <a href="War%20cabinet%23Chamberlain%20war%20ministry">War Cabinet</a> and invited the Labour and Liberal parties to join his government, but they declined. He restored Churchill to the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty, with a seat in the War Cabinet. Chamberlain also gave Eden a government post (<a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Dominions">Dominions Secretary</a>) but not a seat in the small War Cabinet. The new First Lord proved to be a difficult Cabinet colleague, deluging the Prime Minister with a sea of lengthy memos. Chamberlain castigated Churchill for sending so many memos, as the two met in War Cabinet every day. Chamberlain suspected, correctly as it proved after the war, that "these letters are for the purpose of quotation in the Book that he will write hereafter." Chamberlain was also able to deter some of Churchill's more extreme plans, such as <a href="Operation%20Catherine">Operation Catherine</a>, which would have sent three heavily armoured battleships into the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> with an aircraft carrier and other support vessels as a means of stopping shipments of iron ore to Germany. With the naval war the only significant front involving the British in the early months of the conflict, the First Lord's obvious desire to wage a ruthless, victorious war established him as a leader-in-waiting in the public consciousness and among parliamentary colleagues.

With little land action in the west, the initial months of the war were dubbed the "Bore War," later renamed the "<a href="Phoney%20War">Phoney War</a>" by journalists. Chamberlain, in common with most Allied officials and generals, felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on Germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament. The Prime Minister was reluctant to go too far in altering the British economy. The government submitted an emergency war budget about which Chamberlain stated, "the only thing that matters is to win the war, though we may go bankrupt in the process." Government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between September 1939 and March 1940. Despite these difficulties, Chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68% and almost 60% in April 1940.

In early 1940 <a href="Plan%20R%204">the Allies approved</a> a naval campaign designed to seize the northern part of Norway, a neutral country, including the key port of <a href="Narvik">Narvik</a>, and possibly also to seize the iron mines at <a href="G%C3%A4llivare">Gällivare</a> in northern Sweden, from which Germany obtained much of its iron ore. As the Baltic froze in winter, the iron ore was then sent south by ship from Narvik. The Allies planned to begin by <a href="Operation%20Wilfred">mining Norwegian waters</a>, thus provoking a German reaction in Norway, and then would occupy much of the country. Unforeseen by the Allies, Germany had also planned to occupy Norway, and on 9 April German troops occupied Denmark and began an <a href="Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung">invasion of Norway</a>. German forces quickly overran much of the country. The Allies sent troops to Norway, but they met with little success, and on 26 April the War Cabinet ordered a withdrawal. The Prime Minister's opponents decided to turn the <a href="adjournment%20debate">adjournment debate</a> for the <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a> recess into a challenge to Chamberlain, who soon heard about the plan. After initial anger, Chamberlain determined to fight.

What became known as the "<a href="Norway%20debate">Norway debate</a>" opened on 7 May, and lasted for two days. The initial speeches, including Chamberlain's, were nondescript, but Admiral of the Fleet Sir <a href="Roger%20Keyes%2C%201st%20Baron%20Keyes">Roger Keyes</a>, member for <a href="Portsmouth%20North%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Portsmouth North</a>, in full uniform, delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the Norway campaign, though he excluded Churchill from criticism. <a href="Leo%20Amery">Leo Amery</a> then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>'s words on dissolving the <a href="Long%20Parliament">Long Parliament</a>: "You have sat here too long for any good you are doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!" When Labour announced that they would call for a division of the House of Commons, Chamberlain called upon his "friends—and I still have some friends in this House—to support the Government tonight." Because the use of the word "friends" was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an "error of judgment" for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty "when the gravity of the war situation required national unity." Lloyd George joined the attackers, and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government. When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38 MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.

Chamberlain spent much of 9 May in meetings with his Cabinet colleagues. Many Conservative MPs, even those who had voted against the government, indicated on 9 May and in the days following that they did not wish Chamberlain to depart but rather would seek to reconstruct his government. Chamberlain decided that he would resign unless the Labour Party was willing to join his government, and so he met with Attlee later that day. Attlee was unwilling, but agreed to consult his National Executive then meeting in <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>. Chamberlain favoured Halifax as the next Prime Minister, but Halifax proved reluctant to press his own claims, and Churchill emerged as the choice. The following day, Germany invaded the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> and Chamberlain considered remaining in office. Attlee confirmed that Labour would not serve under Chamberlain, though they were willing to serve under someone else. Accordingly, Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace to resign and advise the King to send for Churchill. Churchill later expressed gratitude to Chamberlain for not advising the King to send for Halifax, who would have commanded the support of most government MPs. In a resignation broadcast that evening, Chamberlain told the nation,

Queen Elizabeth told Chamberlain that her daughter, <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Princess Elizabeth</a>, wept as she heard the broadcast. Churchill wrote to express his gratitude for Chamberlain's willingness to stand by him in the nation's hour of need, and Lord Baldwin, the only living former Prime Minister besides Chamberlain and Lloyd George, wrote, "You have passed through fire since we were talking together only a fortnight ago, and you have come out pure gold."

In a departure from usual practice, Chamberlain did not issue any <a href="Prime%20Minister%27s%20Resignation%20Honours">resignation Honours list</a>. With Chamberlain remaining leader of the Conservative Party, and with many MPs still supporting him and distrusting the new Prime Minister, Churchill refrained from any purge of Chamberlain loyalists. Churchill wished Chamberlain to return to the Exchequer, but he declined, convinced that this would lead to difficulties with the Labour Party. Instead, he accepted the post of <a href="Lord%20President%20of%20the%20Council">Lord President of the Council</a> with a seat in the shrunken five-member War Cabinet. When Chamberlain entered the House of Commons on 13 May 1940, for the first time since his resignation, "MPs lost their heads, they shouted, they cheered, they waved their order papers, and his reception was a regular ovation." The House received Churchill coolly; some of his great speeches to the chamber, such as "<a href="We%20shall%20fight%20on%20the%20beaches">We shall fight on the beaches</a>," met with only half-hearted enthusiasm.

Chamberlain's fall from power left him deeply depressed; he wrote, "Few men can have known such a reversal of fortune in so short a time." He especially regretted the loss of <a href="Chequers">Chequers</a> as "a place where I have been so happy," though after a farewell visit there by the Chamberlains on 19 June, he wrote, "I am content now that I have done that, and shall put Chequers out of my mind." As Lord President, Chamberlain assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the War Cabinet during Churchill's many absences. Attlee later remembered him as "free from any of the rancour he might have felt against us. He worked very hard and well: a good chairman, a good committeeman, always very businesslike." As chairman of the <a href="Lord%20President%27s%20Committee">Lord President's Committee</a>, he exerted great influence over the wartime economy. Halifax reported to the War Cabinet on 26 May 1940, with the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> conquered and French Prime Minister <a href="Paul%20Reynaud">Paul Reynaud</a> warning that France might have to sign an armistice, that diplomatic contacts with a still-neutral Italy offered the possibility of a negotiated peace. Halifax urged following up and seeing if a worthwhile offer could be obtained. The <a href="May%201940%20War%20Cabinet%20Crisis">battle over the course of action within the War Cabinet</a> lasted three days; Chamberlain's statement on the final day, that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the matter should not be pursued at that time, helped persuade the War Cabinet to reject negotiations.

Twice in May 1940, Churchill broached the subject of bringing Lloyd George into the government. Each time, Chamberlain indicated that due to their longtime antipathy he would immediately retire if Lloyd George were appointed a minister. Churchill did not appoint Lloyd George, but brought up the subject with Chamberlain again early in June. This time, Chamberlain agreed to Lloyd George's appointment provided Lloyd George gave a personal assurance to put aside the feud. Lloyd George declined to serve in Churchill's government.

Chamberlain worked to bring his Conservative Party in line behind Churchill, working with the <a href="Chief%20Whip">Chief Whip</a>, <a href="David%20Margesson">David Margesson</a>, to overcome members' suspicions and dislikes of the Prime Minister. On 4 July, after the <a href="Attack%20on%20Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir">British attack on the French fleet</a>, Churchill entered the chamber to a great cheer from Conservative MPs orchestrated by the two, and the Prime Minister was almost overcome with emotion at the first cheer he had received from his own party's benches since May. Churchill returned the loyalty, refusing to consider Labour and Liberal attempts to expel Chamberlain from the government. When criticisms of Chamberlain appeared in the press, and when Chamberlain learned that Labour intended to use an upcoming secret session of Parliament as a platform to attack him, he told Churchill that he could only defend himself by attacking Labour. The Prime Minister intervened with the Labour Party and the press and the criticism ceased, according to Chamberlain, "like turning off a tap".

In July 1940, a polemic titled "<a href="Guilty%20Men">Guilty Men</a>" was released by "Cato"—a pseudonym for three journalists (including future Labour leader <a href="Michael%20Foot">Michael Foot</a>). It attacked the record of the National Government, alleging that it had failed to prepare adequately for war. It called for the removal of Chamberlain and other ministers who had allegedly contributed to the British disasters of the early part of the war. The short book sold more than 200,000 copies, many of which were passed from hand-to-hand, and went into 27 editions in the first few months, despite not being carried by several major bookshops. According to historian David Dutton, "its impact upon Chamberlain's reputation, both among the general public and within the academic world, was profound indeed."

Chamberlain had long enjoyed excellent health, except for occasional attacks of gout, but by July 1940 he was in almost constant pain. He sought treatment, and later that month entered hospital for surgery. Surgeons discovered that he was suffering from terminal <a href="Colorectal%20cancer">bowel cancer</a>, but they concealed it from him, instead telling him that he would not require further surgery. Chamberlain resumed work in mid-August. He returned to his office on 9 September, but renewed pain, compounded by the night-time bombing of London which forced him to go to an air raid shelter and denied him rest, sapped his energy, and he left London for the last time on 19 September, returning to <a href="Highfield%20Park%2C%20Heckfield">Highfield Park</a> in <a href="Heckfield">Heckfield</a>. Chamberlain offered his resignation to Churchill on 22 September. The Prime Minister was initially reluctant to accept, but as both men realised that Chamberlain would never return to work, Churchill finally allowed him to resign. The Prime Minister asked if Chamberlain would accept the highest order of British chivalry, the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, of which his brother had been a member. Chamberlain refused, saying he would "prefer to die plain 'Mr Chamberlain' like my father before me, unadorned by any title."

In the short time remaining to him, Chamberlain was angered by the "short, cold and for the most part depreciatory" press comments on his retirement, according to him written "without the slightest sign of sympathy for the man or even any comprehension that there may be a human tragedy in the background." The King and Queen drove down from <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor</a> to visit the dying man on 14 October. Chamberlain received hundreds of sympathetic letters from friends and supporters. He wrote to <a href="John%20Simon%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Simon">John Simon</a>, who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Chamberlain's government:

Chamberlain died of <a href="bowel%20cancer">bowel cancer</a> on 9 November 1940 at the age of 71. A funeral service took place at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> (due to wartime security concerns, the date and time were not widely publicised), and after his body was cremated its ashes were interred there next to those of <a href="Bonar%20Law">Bonar Law</a>. Churchill eulogised Chamberlain in the House of Commons three days after his death:

Though some Chamberlain supporters found Churchill's oratory to be <a href="Damn%20with%20faint%20praise">faint praise</a> of the late Prime Minister, Churchill added less publicly, "Whatever shall I do without poor Neville? I was relying on him to look after the Home Front for me." Amongst others who paid tribute to Chamberlain in the Commons and in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> on 12 November were Lord Halifax, Attlee, and the Liberal Party leader and Air Minister, Sir <a href="Archibald%20Sinclair">Archibald Sinclair</a>. Lloyd George, the only former Prime Minister remaining in the Commons, had been expected to speak, but absented himself from the proceedings. Ever close to his family, the executors of Chamberlain's will were his cousins, <a href="Wilfred%20Byng%20Kenrick">Wilfred Byng Kenrick</a> and <a href="Martineau%20family">Sir Wilfrid Martineau</a>, both of whom, like Chamberlain, were <a href="Lord%20Mayor">Lord Mayor</a>s of Birmingham.

A few days before his death, Neville Chamberlain wrote,

"Guilty Men" was not the only Second World War tract that damaged Chamberlain's reputation. "We Were Not All Wrong", published in 1941, took a similar tack to "Guilty Men", arguing that Liberal and Labour MPs, and a small number of Conservatives, had fought against Chamberlain's appeasement policies. The author, Liberal MP <a href="Geoffrey%20Mander">Geoffrey Mander</a>, had voted against conscription in 1939. Another polemic against Conservative policies was "Why Not Trust the Tories" (1944, written by "Gracchus", who was later revealed to be future Labour minister <a href="Aneurin%20Bevan">Aneurin Bevan</a>), which castigated the Conservatives for the foreign policy decisions of Baldwin and Chamberlain. Though a few Conservatives offered their own versions of events, most notably MP <a href="Quintin%20Hogg%2C%20Baron%20Hailsham%20of%20St%20Marylebone">Quintin Hogg</a> in his 1945 "<a href="The%20Left%20was%20Never%20Right">The Left was Never Right</a>", by the end of the war, there was a very strong public belief that Chamberlain was culpable for serious diplomatic and military misjudgements that had nearly caused Britain's defeat.

Chamberlain's reputation was devastated by these attacks from the left. In 1948, with the publication of "The Gathering Storm", the first volume of Churchill's six-volume set, "<a href="The%20Second%20World%20War%20%28book%20series%29">The Second World War</a>", Chamberlain sustained an even more serious assault from the right. While Churchill stated privately, "this is not history, this is my case", his series was still hugely influential. Churchill depicted Chamberlain as well-meaning but weak, blind to the threat posed by Hitler, and oblivious to the fact that (according to Churchill) Hitler could have been removed from power by a grand coalition of European states. Churchill suggested that the year's delay between Munich and war worsened Britain's position, and criticised Chamberlain for both peacetime and wartime decisions. In the years following the publication of Churchill's books, few historians questioned his judgment.

<a href="Anne%20Chamberlain">Anne Chamberlain</a>, the former premier's widow, suggested that Churchill's work was filled with matters that "are not real misstatements that could easily be corrected, but wholesale omissions and assumptions that certain things are now recognised as facts which actually have no such position".

Many of Chamberlain's family letters and his extensive personal papers were bequeathed by his family in 1974 to the Birmingham University Archives. During the war, the Chamberlain family had commissioned historian <a href="Keith%20Feiling">Keith Feiling</a> to produce an official biography, and gave him access to Chamberlain's private diaries and papers. While Feiling had the right of access to official papers as the official biographer of a recently deceased person, he may not have been aware of the provision, and the <a href="Cabinet%20Secretary">Cabinet Secretary</a> denied his requests for access.

Though Feiling produced what historian David Dutton described in 2001 as "the most impressive and persuasive single-volume biography" of Chamberlain (completed during the war and published in 1946), he could not repair the damage already done to Chamberlain's reputation.

Conservative MP <a href="Iain%20Macleod">Iain Macleod</a>'s 1961 biography of Chamberlain was the first major biography of a revisionist school of thought on Chamberlain. The same year, <a href="A.%20J.%20P.%20Taylor">A. J. P. Taylor</a>, in his "<a href="The%20Origins%20of%20the%20Second%20World%20War">The Origins of the Second World War</a>", found that Chamberlain had adequately rearmed Britain for defence (though a rearmament designed to defeat Germany would have taken massive additional resources) and described Munich as "a triumph for all that was best and most enlightened in British life ... <nowiki>[and]</nowiki> for those who had courageously denounced the harshness and short-sightedness of Versailles".

The adoption of the "<a href="thirty-year%20rule">thirty-year rule</a>" in 1967 made available many of the papers of the Chamberlain government over the subsequent three years, helping to explain why Chamberlain acted as he did. The resultant works greatly fuelled the revisionist school, although they also included books that strongly criticised Chamberlain, such as <a href="Keith%20Middlemas">Keith Middlemas</a>'s 1972 "Diplomacy of Illusion" (which portrayed Chamberlain as a seasoned politician with strategic blindness when it came to Germany). Released papers indicated that, contrary to claims made in "Guilty Men", Chamberlain had neither ignored the advice of the Foreign Office nor had he disregarded and run roughshod over his Cabinet. Other released papers showed that Chamberlain had considered seeking a grand coalition amongst European governments like that later advocated by Churchill, but had rejected it on the ground that the division of Europe into two camps would make war more, not less likely. They also showed that Chamberlain had been advised that the Dominions, pursuing independent foreign policies under the <a href="Statute%20of%20Westminster%201931">Statute of Westminster</a>, had indicated that Chamberlain could not depend on their help in the event of a Continental war. The Chiefs of Staff report, which indicated that Britain could not forcibly prevent Germany from conquering Czechoslovakia, was first publicly known at this time.
In reaction to the revisionist school of thought regarding Chamberlain a post-revisionist school emerged beginning in the 1990s, using the released papers to justify the initial conclusions of "Guilty Men". Oxford historian <a href="R.%20A.%20C.%20Parker">R. A. C. Parker</a> argued that Chamberlain could have forged a close alliance with France after the "<a href="Anschlu%C3%9F">Anschluß</a>", in early 1938, and begun a policy of containment of Germany under the auspices of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>. While many revisionist writers had suggested that Chamberlain had had few or no choices in his actions, Parker argued that Chamberlain and his colleagues had chosen appeasement over other viable policies. In his two volumes, "Chamberlain and Appeasement" (1993) and "Churchill and Appeasement" (2000), Parker stated that Chamberlain, due to his "powerful, obstinate personality" and his skill in debate, caused Britain to embrace appeasement instead of effective deterrence. Parker also suggested that had Churchill held high office in the second half of the 1930s Churchill would have built a series of alliances which would have deterred Hitler, and perhaps would have caused Hitler's domestic opponents to procure his removal.

Dutton observes that Chamberlain's reputation, for good or ill, will probably always be closely tied to evaluation of his policy toward Germany:




 Chamberlain's arms were "Gules eight Cinquefoils in orle Or"

Dioxygen is used in <a href="cellular%20respiration">cellular respiration</a> and many major classes of <a href="organic%20molecule">organic molecule</a>s in <a href="living%20organism">living organism</a>s contain oxygen, such as <a href="protein">protein</a>s, <a href="nucleic%20acid">nucleic acid</a>s, <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s, and <a href="fat">fat</a>s, as do the major constituent <a href="inorganic%20compound">inorganic compound</a>s of animal shells, teeth, and bone. Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of <a href="water">water</a>, the major constituent of lifeforms. Oxygen is continuously replenished in Earth's atmosphere by <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms. Another form (<a href="allotropes%20of%20oxygen">allotrope</a>) of oxygen, <a href="ozone">ozone</a> (), strongly absorbs ultraviolet <a href="UVB">UVB</a> radiation and the high-altitude <a href="ozone%20layer">ozone layer</a> helps protect the <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a> from <a href="ultraviolet%20radiation">ultraviolet radiation</a>. However, ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of <a href="smog">smog</a> and thus a pollutant.

Oxygen was isolated by <a href="Sendivogius">Michael Sendivogius</a> before 1604, but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by <a href="Carl%20Wilhelm%20Scheele">Carl Wilhelm Scheele</a>, in <a href="Uppsala">Uppsala</a>, in 1773 or earlier, and <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> in <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>, in 1774. Priority is often given for Priestley because his work was published first. Priestley, however, called oxygen "dephlogisticated air", and did not recognize it as a chemical element. The name "oxygen" was coined in 1777 by <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a>, who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.

Common uses of oxygen include production of <a href="steel">steel</a>, <a href="plastics">plastics</a> and <a href="textiles">textiles</a>, <a href="Oxy-fuel%20welding%20and%20cutting">brazing, welding and cutting</a> of steels and other <a href="metals">metals</a>, <a href="rocket%20propellant">rocket propellant</a>, <a href="oxygen%20therapy">oxygen therapy</a>, and <a href="life%20support%20system">life support system</a>s in <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a>, <a href="submarines">submarines</a>, <a href="human%20spaceflight">spaceflight</a> and <a href="underwater%20diving">diving</a>.

One of the first known experiments on the relationship between <a href="combustion">combustion</a> and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> writer on mechanics, <a href="Philo%20of%20Byzantium">Philo of Byzantium</a>. In his work "Pneumatica", Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck. Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the <a href="classical%20element">classical element</a> <a href="Fire%20%28classical%20element%29">fire</a> and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass. Many centuries later <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> built on Philo's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and <a href="respiration%20%28physiology%29">respiration</a>.

In the late 17th century, <a href="Robert%20Boyle">Robert Boyle</a> proved that air is necessary for combustion. English chemist <a href="John%20Mayow">John Mayow</a> (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called "spiritus nitroaereus". In one experiment, he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.

Mayow observed that <a href="antimony">antimony</a> increased in weight when heated, and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it. He also thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass it into the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the reaction of nitroaereus with certain substances in the body. Accounts of these and other experiments and ideas were published in 1668 in his work "Tractatus duo" in the tract "De respiratione".

<a href="Robert%20Hooke">Robert Hooke</a>, <a href="Ole%20Borch">Ole Borch</a>, <a href="Mikhail%20Lomonosov">Mikhail Lomonosov</a>, and <a href="Pierre%20Bayen">Pierre Bayen</a> all produced oxygen in experiments in the 17th and the 18th century but none of them recognized it as a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>. This may have been in part due to the prevalence of the philosophy of combustion and <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> called the "phlogiston theory", which was then the favored explanation of those processes.

Established in 1667 by the German alchemist <a href="J.%20J.%20Becher">J. J. Becher</a>, and modified by the chemist <a href="Georg%20Ernst%20Stahl">Georg Ernst Stahl</a> by 1731, phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made of two parts. One part, called phlogiston, was given off when the substance containing it was burned, while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form, or <a href="calx">calx</a>.

Highly combustible materials that leave little <a href="residue%20%28chemistry%29">residue</a>, such as wood or coal, were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston; non-combustible substances that corrode, such as iron, contained very little. Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory, nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea; instead, it was based on observations of what happens when something burns, that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.

Polish <a href="Alchemy">alchemist</a>, <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a>, and <a href="physician">physician</a> <a href="Sendivogius">Michael Sendivogius</a> in his work "De Lapide Philosophorum Tractatus duodecim e naturae fonte et manuali experientia depromti" (1604) described a substance contained in air, referring to it as 'cibus vitae' (food of life), and this substance is identical with oxygen. Sendivogius, during his experiments performed between 1598 and 1604, properly recognized that the substance is equivalent to the gaseous byproduct released by the <a href="thermal%20decomposition">thermal decomposition</a> of <a href="potassium%20nitrate">potassium nitrate</a>. In Bugaj’s view, the <a href="List%20of%20purification%20methods%20in%20chemistry">isolation</a> of oxygen and the proper association of the substance to that part of air which is required for life, lends sufficient weight to the discovery of oxygen by Sendivogius. This discovery of Sendivogius was however frequently denied by the generations of scientists and chemists which succeeded him.

It is also commonly claimed that oxygen was first discovered by Swedish pharmacist <a href="Carl%20Wilhelm%20Scheele">Carl Wilhelm Scheele</a>. He had produced oxygen gas by heating <a href="Mercury%28II%29%20oxide">mercuric oxide</a> and various <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>s in 1771–2. Scheele called the gas "fire air" because it was then the only known <a href="Oxidizing%20agent">agent</a> to support combustion. He wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript titled "Treatise on Air and Fire", which he sent to his publisher in 1775. That document was published in 1777.

In the meantime, on August 1, 1774, an experiment conducted by the British clergyman <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> focused sunlight on <a href="mercury%28II%29%20oxide">mercuric oxide</a> (HgO) contained in a glass tube, which liberated a gas he named "dephlogisticated air". He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while <a href="breathing">breathing</a> it. After breathing the gas himself, Priestley wrote: "The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of <a href="Atmosphere%20of%20Earth">common air</a>, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards." Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled "An Account of Further Discoveries in Air," which was included in the second volume of his book titled "<a href="Experiments%20and%20Observations%20on%20Different%20Kinds%20of%20Air">Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air</a>". Because he published his findings first, Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.

The French chemist <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Laurent Lavoisier</a> later claimed to have discovered the new substance independently. Priestley visited Lavoisier in October 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas. Scheele also dispatched a letter to Lavoisier on September 30, 1774, that described his discovery of the previously unknown substance, but Lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it (a copy of the letter was found in Scheele's belongings after his death).

Lavoisier conducted the first adequate quantitative experiments on <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> and gave the first correct explanation of how combustion works. He used these and similar experiments, all started in 1774, to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance discovered by Priestley and Scheele was a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>.

In one experiment, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when <a href="tin">tin</a> and air were heated in a closed container. He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container, which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed. He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in. This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book "Sur la combustion en général", which was published in 1777. In that work, he proved that air is a mixture of two gases; 'vital air', which is essential to combustion and respiration, and "azote" (Gk. "" "lifeless"), which did not support either. "Azote" later became "<a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>" in English, although it has kept the earlier name in French and several other European languages.

Lavoisier renamed 'vital air' to "oxygène" in 1777 from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> roots " (oxys)" (<a href="acid">acid</a>, literally "sharp", from the taste of acids) and "-γενής (-genēs)" (producer, literally begetter), because he mistakenly believed that oxygen was a constituent of all acids. Chemists (such as Sir <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Humphry Davy</a> in 1812) eventually determined that Lavoisier was wrong in this regard (hydrogen forms the basis for acid chemistry), but by then the name was too well established.

"Oxygen" entered the English language despite opposition by English scientists and the fact that the Englishman Priestley had first isolated the gas and written about it. This is partly due to a poem praising the gas titled "Oxygen" in the popular book "<a href="The%20Botanic%20Garden">The Botanic Garden</a>" (1791) by <a href="Erasmus%20Darwin">Erasmus Darwin</a>, grandfather of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>.
<a href="John%20Dalton">John Dalton</a>'s original <a href="Atomic%20theory%23Earliest%20empirical%20evidence">atomic hypothesis</a> presumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed that water's formula was HO, leading to the conclusion that the <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a> of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. In 1805, <a href="Joseph%20Louis%20Gay-Lussac">Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac</a> and <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a> showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen; and by 1811 <a href="Amedeo%20Avogadro">Amedeo Avogadro</a> had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called <a href="Avogadro%27s%20law">Avogadro's law</a> and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases.

By the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a <a href="Cascade%20%28chemical%20engineering%29">cascade</a> method, Swiss chemist and physicist <a href="Raoul%20Pictet">Raoul Pierre Pictet</a> <a href="evaporation">evaporated</a> liquid <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> in order to liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the <a href="French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">French Academy of Sciences</a> in Paris announcing his discovery of <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a>. Just two days later, French physicist <a href="Louis%20Paul%20Cailletet">Louis Paul Cailletet</a> announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only a few drops of the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquefied in a stable state for the first time on March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from <a href="Jagiellonian%20University">Jagiellonian University</a>, <a href="Zygmunt%20Wr%C3%B3blewski">Zygmunt Wróblewski</a> and <a href="Karol%20Olszewski">Karol Olszewski</a>.

In 1891 Scottish chemist <a href="James%20Dewar">James Dewar</a> was able to produce enough liquid oxygen for study. The first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by German engineer <a href="Carl%20von%20Linde">Carl von Linde</a> and British engineer William Hampson. Both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then <a href="distillation">distilled</a> the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them separately. Later, in 1901, oxyacetylene <a href="welding">welding</a> was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of <a href="acetylene">acetylene</a> and compressed . This method of welding and cutting metal later became common.

In 1923, the American scientist <a href="Robert%20H.%20Goddard">Robert H. Goddard</a> became the first person to develop a <a href="rocket%20engine">rocket engine</a> that burned liquid fuel; the engine used <a href="gasoline">gasoline</a> for fuel and liquid oxygen as the <a href="oxidizer">oxidizer</a>. Goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56 m at 97 km/h on March 16, 1926 in <a href="Auburn%2C%20Massachusetts">Auburn, Massachusetts</a>, US.

Oxygen levels in the atmosphere are trending slightly downward globally, possibly because of fossil-fuel burning.

At <a href="standard%20temperature%20and%20pressure">standard temperature and pressure</a>, oxygen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas with the <a href="molecular%20formula">molecular formula</a> , referred to as dioxygen.

As "dioxygen", two oxygen atoms are <a href="chemical%20bond">chemically bound</a> to each other. The bond can be variously described based on level of theory, but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent <a href="double%20bond">double bond</a> that results from the filling of <a href="molecular%20orbitals">molecular orbitals</a> formed from the <a href="atomic%20orbital">atomic orbital</a>s of the individual oxygen atoms, the filling of which results in a <a href="bond%20order">bond order</a> of two. More specifically, the double bond is the result of sequential, low-to-high energy, or <a href="Aufbau%20principle">Aufbau</a>, filling of orbitals, and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons, after sequential filling of the low σ and σ orbitals; σ overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O-O molecular axis and overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O-O molecular axis, and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest and orbitals.

This combination of cancellations and σ and overlaps results in dioxygen's double bond character and reactivity, and a triplet electronic <a href="ground%20state">ground state</a>. An <a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a> with two unpaired electrons, as is found in dioxygen orbitals (see the filled * orbitals in the diagram) that are of equal energy—i.e., <a href="degenerate%20orbitals">degenerate</a>—is a configuration termed a <a href="spin%20triplet">spin triplet</a> state. Hence, the ground state of the molecule is referred to as <a href="triplet%20oxygen">triplet oxygen</a>. The highest energy, partially filled orbitals are <a href="antibonding">antibonding</a>, and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two. Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous combustion.
In the triplet form, molecules are <a href="paramagnetism">paramagnetic</a>. That is, they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field, because of the <a href="Spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a> <a href="magnetic%20moment">magnetic moment</a>s of the unpaired electrons in the molecule, and the negative <a href="exchange%20energy">exchange energy</a> between neighboring molecules. Liquid oxygen is so <a href="magnet">magnet</a>ic that, in laboratory demonstrations, a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet.

<a href="Singlet%20oxygen">Singlet oxygen</a> is a name given to several higher-energy species of molecular in which all the electron spins are paired. It is much more reactive with common <a href="organic%20compound">organic molecules</a> than is molecular oxygen per se. In nature, singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis, using the energy of sunlight. It is also produced in the <a href="troposphere">troposphere</a> by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength, and by the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> as a source of active oxygen. <a href="Carotenoid">Carotenoid</a>s in photosynthetic organisms (and possibly animals) play a major role in absorbing energy from <a href="singlet%20oxygen">singlet oxygen</a> and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues.

The common <a href="Allotropy">allotrope</a> of elemental oxygen on Earth is called <a href="Allotropes%20of%20oxygen">dioxygen</a>, , the major part of the Earth's atmospheric oxygen (see <a href="%23Occurrence">Occurrence</a>). O has a bond length of 121 <a href="Picometre">pm</a> and a bond energy of 498 <a href="joule%20per%20mole">kJ/mol</a>, which is smaller than the energy of other double bonds or pairs of single bonds in the <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a> and responsible for the <a href="exothermic">exothermic</a> reaction of O with any organic molecule. Due to its energy content, O is used by complex forms of life, such as animals, in <a href="cellular%20respiration">cellular respiration</a>. Other aspects of are covered in the remainder of this article.

Trioxygen () is usually known as <a href="ozone">ozone</a> and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue. Ozone is produced in the <a href="upper%20atmosphere">upper atmosphere</a> when combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of by <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> (UV) radiation. Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the <a href="Electromagnetic%20spectrum">spectrum</a>, the <a href="ozone%20layer">ozone layer</a> of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet. Near the Earth's surface, it is a <a href="air%20pollution">pollutant</a> formed as a by-product of <a href="exhaust%20system">automobile exhaust</a>. At <a href="low%20earth%20orbit">low earth orbit</a> altitudes, sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause <a href="corrosion%20in%20space">corrosion of spacecraft</a>.

The <a href="Metastability%20in%20molecules">metastable</a> molecule <a href="tetraoxygen">tetraoxygen</a> () was discovered in 2001, and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of <a href="solid%20oxygen">solid oxygen</a>. It was proven in 2006 that this phase, created by pressurizing to 20 <a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">GPa</a>, is in fact a <a href="rhombohedral">rhombohedral</a> <a href="Cluster%20chemistry">cluster</a>. This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful <a href="oxidizing%20agent">oxidizer</a> than either or and may therefore be used in <a href="rocket%20fuel">rocket fuel</a>. A metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 GPa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures, this phase becomes <a href="superconductivity">superconducting</a>.

Oxygen <a href="Solubility">dissolves</a> more readily in water than nitrogen, and in freshwater more readily than seawater. Water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved for every 2 molecules of (1:2), compared with an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1:4. The solubility of oxygen in water is temperature-dependent, and about twice as much (14.6 mg·L) dissolves at 0 °C than at 20 °C (7.6 mg·L). At 25 °C and of air, freshwater contains about 6.04 <a href="Litre">milliliters</a> (mL) of oxygen per <a href="liter">liter</a>, and <a href="seawater">seawater</a> contains about 4.95 mL per liter. At 5 °C the solubility increases to 9.0 mL (50% more than at 25 °C) per liter for water and 7.2 mL (45% more) per liter for sea water.

Oxygen condenses at 90.20 <a href="kelvin">K</a> (−182.95 °C, −297.31 °F), and freezes at 54.36 K (−218.79 °C, −361.82 °F). Both <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid</a> and <a href="solid%20oxygen">solid</a> are clear substances with a light <a href="diffuse%20sky%20radiation">sky-blue</a> color caused by absorption in the red (in contrast with the blue color of the sky, which is due to <a href="Rayleigh%20scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a> of blue light). High-purity liquid is usually obtained by the <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> of liquefied air. Liquid oxygen may also be condensed from air using liquid nitrogen as a coolant.

Oxygen is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials.

The spectroscopy of molecular oxygen is associated with the atmospheric processes of <a href="aurora">aurora</a> and <a href="airglow">airglow</a>. The absorption in the <a href="Herzberg%20continuum">Herzberg continuum</a> and <a href="Schumann%E2%80%93Runge%20bands">Schumann–Runge bands</a> in the ultraviolet produces atomic oxygen that is important in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere. Excited state singlet molecular oxygen is responsible for red chemiluminescence in solution.

Naturally occurring oxygen is composed of three stable <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s, <a href="oxygen-16">O</a>, <a href="oxygen-17">O</a>, and <a href="oxygen-18">O</a>, with O being the most abundant (99.762% <a href="natural%20abundance">natural abundance</a>).

Most O is <a href="nucleosynthesis">synthesized</a> at the end of the <a href="helium%20fusion">helium fusion</a> process in massive <a href="star">star</a>s but some is made in the <a href="neon%20burning%20process">neon burning process</a>. O is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into <a href="helium">helium</a> during the <a href="CNO%20cycle">CNO cycle</a>, making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars. Most O is produced when <a href="Nitrogen-14">N</a> (made abundant from CNO burning) captures a <a href="Helium-4">He</a> nucleus, making O common in the helium-rich zones of <a href="Stellar%20evolution%23Massive%20stars">evolved, massive stars</a>.

Fourteen <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a>s have been characterized. The most stable are O with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 122.24 seconds and O with a half-life of 70.606 seconds. All of the remaining <a href="Radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a> isotopes have half-lives that are less than 27 s and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 83 milliseconds. The most common <a href="decay%20mode">decay mode</a> of the isotopes lighter than O is <a href="positron%20emission">β decay</a> to yield nitrogen, and the most common mode for the isotopes heavier than O is <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> to yield <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a>.

Oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the Earth's <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a>, air, sea and land. Oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. About 0.9% of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>'s mass is oxygen. Oxygen constitutes 49.2% of the <a href="Earth%27s%20crust">Earth's crust</a> by mass as part of oxide compounds such as <a href="silicon%20dioxide">silicon dioxide</a> and is the most abundant element by mass in the <a href="crust%20%28geology%29%23Earth%27s%20crust%20and%20mantle">Earth's crust</a>. It is also the major component of the world's oceans (88.8% by mass). Oxygen gas is the second most common component of the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>, taking up 20.8% of its volume and 23.1% of its mass (some 10 tonnes). Earth is unusual among the planets of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere: <a href="Mars">Mars</a> (with 0.1% by volume) and <a href="Venus">Venus</a> have much less. The surrounding those planets is produced solely by the action of ultraviolet radiation on oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide.

The unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on Earth is the result of the <a href="oxygen%20cycle">oxygen cycle</a>. This <a href="biogeochemical%20cycle">biogeochemical cycle</a> describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the <a href="lithosphere">lithosphere</a>. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while <a href="Cellular%20respiration">respiration</a>, <a href="Decomposition">decay</a>, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.

Free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world's water bodies. The increased solubility of at lower temperatures (see <a href="%23Physical%20properties">Physical properties</a>) has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content. <a href="Water%20pollution">Water polluted</a> with plant nutrients such as <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>s or <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a>s may stimulate growth of algae by a process called <a href="eutrophication">eutrophication</a> and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce the content in eutrophic water bodies. Scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water's <a href="biochemical%20oxygen%20demand">biochemical oxygen demand</a>, or the amount of needed to restore it to a normal concentration.

<a href="Paleoclimatology">Paleoclimatologists</a> measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the <a href="Animal%20shell">shells</a> and <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>s of marine organisms to determine the climate millions of years ago (see <a href="oxygen%20isotope%20ratio%20cycle">oxygen isotope ratio cycle</a>). <a href="Seawater">Seawater</a> molecules that contain the lighter <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of <a href="ice%20core">ice core</a> samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.

<a href="Geology%20of%20solar%20terrestrial%20planets">Planetary geologists</a> have measured the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in samples from the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>, <a href="Mars">Mars</a>, and <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s, but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, believed to be the same as those of the <a href="Nebular%20hypothesis">primordial solar nebula</a>. Analysis of a <a href="silicon">silicon</a> wafer exposed to the <a href="solar%20wind">solar wind</a> in space and returned by the crashed <a href="Genesis%20%28spacecraft%29">Genesis spacecraft</a> has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. The measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the Sun's <a href="Protoplanetary%20disk">disk of protoplanetary material</a> prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the Earth.

Oxygen presents two spectrophotometric <a href="absorption%20band">absorption band</a>s peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760 <a href="Nanometre">nm</a>. Some <a href="remote%20sensing">remote sensing</a> scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a <a href="Earth%20observation%20satellite">satellite</a> platform. This approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's <a href="reflectance">reflectance</a> from its <a href="fluorescence">fluorescence</a>, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low <a href="signal-to-noise%20ratio">signal-to-noise ratio</a> and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a> from satellites on a global scale.

In nature, free oxygen is produced by the <a href="photolysis">light-driven splitting</a> of water during oxygenic <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. According to some estimates, <a href="green%20algae">green algae</a> and <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.

A simplified overall formula for photosynthesis is:

or simply

Photolytic <a href="oxygen%20evolution">oxygen evolution</a> occurs in the <a href="thylakoid%20membrane">thylakoid membrane</a>s of photosynthetic organisms and requires the energy of four <a href="photon">photon</a>s. Many steps are involved, but the result is the formation of a <a href="proton">proton</a> gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which is used to synthesize <a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate</a> (ATP) via <a href="photophosphorylation">photophosphorylation</a>. The remaining (after production of the water molecule) is released into the atmosphere.

Oxygen is used in <a href="Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a> to generate ATP during <a href="oxidative%20phosphorylation">oxidative phosphorylation</a>. The reaction for aerobic respiration is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis and is simplified as:

In <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, <a href="diffusion">diffuses</a> through membranes in the lungs and into <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s. <a href="Hemoglobin">Hemoglobin</a> binds , changing color from bluish red to bright red ( is released from another part of hemoglobin through the <a href="Bohr%20effect">Bohr effect</a>). Other animals use <a href="hemocyanin">hemocyanin</a> (<a href="Mollusca">molluscs</a> and some <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s) or <a href="hemerythrin">hemerythrin</a> (<a href="spider">spider</a>s and <a href="lobster">lobster</a>s). A liter of blood can dissolve 200 cm of .

Until the discovery of <a href="Anaerobic%20organism">anaerobic</a> <a href="animal">metazoa</a>, oxygen was thought to be a requirement for all complex life.

<a href="Reactive%20oxygen%20species">Reactive oxygen species</a>, such as <a href="superoxide">superoxide</a> ion () and <a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a> (), are reactive by-products of oxygen use in organisms. Parts of the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> of higher organisms create peroxide, superoxide, and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes. Reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the <a href="hypersensitive%20response">hypersensitive response</a> of plants against pathogen attack. Oxygen is damaging to <a href="Obligate%20anaerobe">obligately anaerobic organisms</a>, which were the dominant form of <a href="Evolutionary%20history%20of%20life">early life</a> on Earth until began to accumulate in the <a href="Atmosphere%20of%20Earth">atmosphere</a> about 2.5 billion years ago during the <a href="Great%20Oxygenation%20Event">Great Oxygenation Event</a>, about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms.

An adult human at rest <a href="breathing">inhales</a> 1.8 to 2.4 grams of oxygen per minute. This amounts to more than 6 billion tonnes of oxygen inhaled by humanity per year.

The free oxygen <a href="partial%20pressure">partial pressure</a> in the body of a living vertebrate organism is highest in the <a href="respiratory%20system">respiratory system</a>, and decreases along any <a href="arterial%20system">arterial system</a>, peripheral tissues, and <a href="venous%20system">venous system</a>, respectively. Partial pressure is the pressure that oxygen would have if it alone occupied the volume.

Free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a> before photosynthetic <a href="archaea">archaea</a> and <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago. Free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the <a href="Paleoproterozoic">Paleoproterozoic</a> eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago). For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved <a href="iron">iron</a> in the oceans to form <a href="banded%20iron%20formation">banded iron formation</a>s. When such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to <a href="Outgassing">outgas</a> from the oceans 3–2.7 billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7 billion years ago.

The presence of large amounts of dissolved and free oxygen in the oceans and atmosphere may have driven most of the extant <a href="anaerobic%20organism">anaerobic organism</a>s to <a href="extinction">extinction</a> during the <a href="Great%20Oxygenation%20Event">Great Oxygenation Event</a> ("oxygen catastrophe") about 2.4 billion years ago. <a href="Cellular%20respiration">Cellular respiration</a> using enables <a href="aerobic%20organism">aerobic organism</a>s to produce much more <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a> than anaerobic organisms. Cellular respiration of occurs in all <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s, including all complex multicellular organisms such as plants and animals.

Since the beginning of the <a href="Cambrian">Cambrian</a> period 540 million years ago, atmospheric levels have fluctuated between 15% and 30% by volume. Towards the end of the <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> period (about 300 million years ago) atmospheric levels reached a maximum of 35% by volume, which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at this time.

Variations in atmospheric oxygen concentration have shaped past climates. When oxygen declined, atmospheric density dropped, which in turn increased surface evaporation, causing precipitation increases and warmer temperatures.

At the current rate of photosynthesis it would take about 2,000 years to regenerate the entire in the present atmosphere.

One hundred million tonnes of are extracted from air for industrial uses annually by two primary methods. The most common method is <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> of liquefied air, with <a href="distillation">distilling</a> as a vapor while is left as a liquid.

The other primary method of producing is passing a stream of clean, dry air through one bed of a pair of identical <a href="zeolite">zeolite</a> molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90% to 93% . Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as <a href="pressure%20swing%20adsorption">pressure swing adsorption</a>. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-<a href="cryogenics">cryogenic</a> technologies (see also the related <a href="vacuum%20swing%20adsorption">vacuum swing adsorption</a>).

Oxygen gas can also be produced through <a href="electrolysis%20of%20water">electrolysis of water</a> into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. A similar method is the electrocatalytic evolution from oxides and <a href="oxoacid">oxoacid</a>s. Chemical catalysts can be used as well, such as in <a href="chemical%20oxygen%20generator">chemical oxygen generator</a>s or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines, and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies. Another air separation method is forcing air to dissolve through <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a> membranes based on <a href="zirconium%20dioxide">zirconium dioxide</a> by either high pressure or an electric current, to produce nearly pure gas.

<a href="Oxygen%20storage">Oxygen storage</a> methods include high pressure <a href="oxygen%20tank">oxygen tank</a>s, cryogenics and chemical compounds. For reasons of economy, oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers, since one <a href="litre">liter</a> of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and . Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through <a href="heat%20exchanger">heat exchanger</a>s, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building. Oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas; a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and <a href="oxy-fuel%20welding%20and%20cutting">oxy-fuel welding and cutting</a>.

Uptake of from the air is the essential purpose of <a href="Respiration%20%28physiology%29">respiration</a>, so oxygen supplementation is used in <a href="medicine">medicine</a>. Treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient's blood, but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs, easing work load on the heart. <a href="Oxygen%20therapy">Oxygen therapy</a> is used to treat <a href="emphysema">emphysema</a>, <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, some heart disorders (<a href="congestive%20heart%20failure">congestive heart failure</a>), some disorders that cause increased <a href="pulmonary%20artery%20pressure">pulmonary artery pressure</a>, and any <a href="disease">disease</a> that impairs the body's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen.

Treatments are flexible enough to be used in hospitals, the patient's home, or increasingly by portable devices. <a href="Oxygen%20tent">Oxygen tent</a>s were once commonly used in oxygen supplementation, but have since been replaced mostly by the use of <a href="oxygen%20mask">oxygen mask</a>s or <a href="nasal%20cannula">nasal cannula</a>s.

<a href="Hyperbaric%20medicine">Hyperbaric</a> (high-pressure) medicine uses special <a href="hyperbaric%20oxygen%20chamber">oxygen chambers</a> to increase the <a href="partial%20pressure">partial pressure</a> of around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff. <a href="Carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning">Carbon monoxide poisoning</a>, <a href="gas%20gangrene">gas gangrene</a>, and <a href="decompression%20sickness">decompression sickness</a> (the 'bends') are sometimes addressed with this therapy. Increased concentration in the lungs helps to displace <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> from the heme group of <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the <a href="anaerobic%20bacteria">anaerobic bacteria</a> that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in the blood. Increasing the pressure of as soon as possible helps to redissolve the bubbles back into the blood so that these excess gasses can be exhaled naturally through the lungs.
Normobaric oxygen administration at the highest available concentration is frequently used as first aid for any diving injury that may involve inert gas bubble formation in the tissues. There is epidemiological support for its use from a statistical study of cases recorded in a long term database.
An application of as a low-pressure <a href="breathing%20gas">breathing gas</a> is in modern <a href="space%20suit">space suit</a>s, which surround their occupant's body with the breathing gas. These devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one-third normal pressure, resulting in a normal blood partial pressure of . This trade-off of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is needed to maintain suit flexibility.

<a href="Scuba%20diving">Scuba</a> and <a href="Surface-supplied%20diving">surface-supplied</a> <a href="underwater%20divers">underwater divers</a> and <a href="submarine">submarine</a>rs also rely on artificially delivered . Submarines, submersibles and <a href="atmospheric%20diving%20suits">atmospheric diving suits</a> usually operate at normal atmospheric pressure. Breathing air is scrubbed of carbon dioxide by chemical extraction and oxygen is replaced to maintain a constant partial pressure. <a href="Ambient%20pressure">Ambient pressure</a> divers breathe air or gas mixtures with an oxygen fraction suited to the operating depth. Pure or nearly pure use in diving at pressures higher than atmospheric is usually limited to <a href="rebreathers">rebreathers</a>, or <a href="Decompression%20%28diving%29">decompression</a> at relatively shallow depths (~6 meters depth, or less), or <a href="Hyperbaric%20treatment%20schedules">medical treatment in recompression chambers</a> at pressures up to 2.8 bar, where acute oxygen toxicity can be managed without the risk of drowning. Deeper diving requires significant dilution of with other gases, such as nitrogen or helium, to prevent <a href="oxygen%20toxicity">oxygen toxicity</a>.

People who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized <a href="fixed-wing%20aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a> sometimes have supplemental supplies. Pressurized commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of automatically supplied to the passengers in case of cabin depressurization. Sudden cabin pressure loss activates <a href="chemical%20oxygen%20generator">chemical oxygen generator</a>s above each seat, causing <a href="oxygen%20mask">oxygen mask</a>s to drop. Pulling on the masks "to start the flow of oxygen" as cabin safety instructions dictate, forces iron filings into the <a href="sodium%20chlorate">sodium chlorate</a> inside the canister. A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the <a href="exothermic">exothermic</a> reaction.

Oxygen, as a mild <a href="euphoria">euphoric</a>, has a history of recreational use in <a href="oxygen%20bar">oxygen bar</a>s and in <a href="sport">sport</a>s. Oxygen bars are establishments found in the United States since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal exposure for a minimal fee. Professional athletes, especially in <a href="American%20football">American football</a>, sometimes go off-field between plays to don oxygen masks to boost performance. The pharmacological effect is doubted; a <a href="placebo">placebo</a> effect is a more likely explanation. Available studies support a performance boost from oxygen enriched mixtures only if it is breathed "during" <a href="aerobic%20exercise">aerobic exercise</a>.

Other recreational uses that do not involve breathing include <a href="pyrotechnic">pyrotechnic</a> applications, such as <a href="George%20Goble">George Goble</a>'s five-second ignition of <a href="barbecue">barbecue</a> grills.

<a href="Smelting">Smelting</a> of <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a> into <a href="steel">steel</a> consumes 55% of commercially produced oxygen. In this process, is injected through a high-pressure lance into molten iron, which removes <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> impurities and excess <a href="carbon">carbon</a> as the respective oxides, and . The reactions are <a href="exothermic%20reaction">exothermic</a>, so the temperature increases to 1,700 °<a href="Celsius">C</a>.

Another 25% of commercially produced oxygen is used by the chemical industry. <a href="Ethylene">Ethylene</a> is reacted with to create <a href="ethylene%20oxide">ethylene oxide</a>, which, in turn, is converted into <a href="ethylene%20glycol">ethylene glycol</a>; the primary feeder material used to manufacture a host of products, including <a href="antifreeze">antifreeze</a> and <a href="polyester">polyester</a> polymers (the precursors of many <a href="plastic">plastic</a>s and <a href="fabric">fabric</a>s).

Most of the remaining 20% of commercially produced oxygen is used in medical applications, <a href="gas%20welding">metal cutting and welding</a>, as an oxidizer in <a href="rocket%20fuel">rocket fuel</a>, and in <a href="water%20treatment">water treatment</a>. Oxygen is used in <a href="oxyacetylene%20welding">oxyacetylene welding</a> burning <a href="acetylene">acetylene</a> with to produce a very hot flame. In this process, metal up to thick is first heated with a small oxy-acetylene flame and then quickly cut by a large stream of .

The <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> of oxygen is −2 in almost all known compounds of oxygen. The oxidation state −1 is found in a few compounds such as <a href="peroxide">peroxide</a>s. Compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon: −1/2 (<a href="superoxide">superoxide</a>s), −1/3 (<a href="ozonide">ozonide</a>s), 0 (<a href="Allotropes%20of%20oxygen">elemental</a>, <a href="hypofluorous%20acid">hypofluorous acid</a>), +1/2 (<a href="dioxygenyl">dioxygenyl</a>), +1 (<a href="dioxygen%20difluoride">dioxygen difluoride</a>), and +2 (<a href="oxygen%20difluoride">oxygen difluoride</a>).

<a href="Water">Water</a> () is an oxide of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and the most familiar oxygen compound. Hydrogen atoms are <a href="covalent%20bonding">covalently bonded</a> to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3 kJ/mol per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule. These <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s between water molecules hold them approximately 15% closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20force">van der Waals force</a>s.
Due to its <a href="electronegativity">electronegativity</a>, oxygen forms <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>s with almost all other elements to give corresponding <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s. The surface of most metals, such as <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> and <a href="titanium">titanium</a>, are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that <a href="Passivation%20%28chemistry%29">passivates</a> the metal and slows further <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a>. Many oxides of the <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>s are <a href="non-stoichiometric%20compound">non-stoichiometric compound</a>s, with slightly less metal than the <a href="chemical%20formula">chemical formula</a> would show. For example, the mineral <a href="Iron%28II%29%20oxide">FeO</a> (<a href="w%C3%BCstite">wüstite</a>) is written as , where "x" is usually around 0.05.

Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (). The <a href="Earth%27s%20crust">Earth's crust</a>al <a href="Rock%20%28geology%29">rock</a> is composed in large part of oxides of <a href="silicon">silicon</a> (<a href="Silicon%20dioxide">silica</a> , as found in <a href="granite">granite</a> and <a href="quartz">quartz</a>), aluminium (<a href="aluminium%20oxide">aluminium oxide</a> , in <a href="bauxite">bauxite</a> and <a href="corundum">corundum</a>), iron (<a href="iron%28III%29%20oxide">iron(III) oxide</a> , in <a href="hematite">hematite</a> and <a href="rust">rust</a>), and <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> (in <a href="limestone">limestone</a>). The rest of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular various complex <a href="silicate">silicate</a>s (in <a href="silicate%20minerals">silicate minerals</a>). The Earth's mantle, of much larger mass than the crust, is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron.

Water-<a href="solubility">soluble</a> silicates in the form of , , and are used as <a href="detergent">detergent</a>s and <a href="adhesive">adhesive</a>s.

Oxygen also acts as a <a href="ligand">ligand</a> for transition metals, forming <a href="transition%20metal%20dioxygen%20complexes">transition metal dioxygen complexes</a>, which feature metal–. This class of compounds includes the <a href="heme">heme</a> proteins <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a> and <a href="myoglobin">myoglobin</a>. An exotic and unusual reaction occurs with <a href="platinum%20hexafluoride"></a>, which oxidizes oxygen to give OPtF, <a href="dioxygenyl%20hexafluoroplatinate">dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate</a>.

Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where "R" is an organic group): <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>s (R-OH); <a href="ether">ether</a>s (R-O-R); <a href="ketone">ketone</a>s (R-CO-R); <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a>s (R-CO-H); <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s (R-COOH); <a href="ester">ester</a>s (R-COO-R); <a href="Organic%20acid%20anhydride">acid anhydrides</a> (R-CO-O-CO-R); and <a href="amide">amide</a>s (). There are many important organic <a href="solvent">solvent</a>s that contain oxygen, including: <a href="acetone">acetone</a>, <a href="methanol">methanol</a>, <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>, <a href="Isopropyl%20alcohol">isopropanol</a>, <a href="furan">furan</a>, <a href="tetrahydrofuran">THF</a>, <a href="diethyl%20ether">diethyl ether</a>, <a href="1%2C4-Dioxane">dioxane</a>, <a href="ethyl%20acetate">ethyl acetate</a>, <a href="dimethylformamide">DMF</a>, <a href="dimethyl%20sulfoxide">DMSO</a>, <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a>, and <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a>. Acetone () and <a href="phenol">phenol</a> () are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: <a href="glycerol">glycerol</a>, <a href="formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a>, <a href="glutaraldehyde">glutaraldehyde</a>, <a href="citric%20acid">citric acid</a>, <a href="acetic%20anhydride">acetic anhydride</a>, and <a href="acetamide">acetamide</a>. <a href="Epoxide">Epoxide</a>s are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms. The element is similarly found in almost all <a href="biomolecule">biomolecule</a>s that are important to (or generated by) life.

Oxygen reacts spontaneously with many <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic</a> compounds at or below room temperature in a process called <a href="autoxidation">autoxidation</a>. Most of the <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of . Organic compounds important in industry and commerce that are made by direct oxidation of a precursor include <a href="ethylene%20oxide">ethylene oxide</a> and <a href="peracetic%20acid">peracetic acid</a>.

The <a href="NFPA%20704">NFPA 704</a> standard rates compressed oxygen gas as nonhazardous to health, nonflammable and nonreactive, but an oxidizer. Refrigerated liquid oxygen (LOX) is given a health hazard rating of 3 (for increased risk of <a href="hyperoxia">hyperoxia</a> from condensed vapors, and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite), and all other ratings are the same as the compressed gas form.

Oxygen gas () can be <a href="Oxygen%20toxicity">toxic</a> at elevated <a href="partial%20pressure">partial pressure</a>s, leading to <a href="convulsion">convulsion</a>s and other health problems. Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilo<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">pascals</a> (kPa), equal to about 50% oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level partial pressure of about 21 kPa. This is not a problem except for patients on <a href="mechanical%20ventilator">mechanical ventilator</a>s, since gas supplied through <a href="oxygen%20mask">oxygen mask</a>s in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%–50% by volume (about 30 kPa at standard pressure).

At one time, <a href="Premature%20birth">premature babies</a> were placed in incubators containing -rich air, but this practice was discontinued after some babies were blinded by the oxygen content being too high.

Breathing pure in space applications, such as in some modern space suits, or in early spacecraft such as <a href="Apollo%20spacecraft">Apollo</a>, causes no damage due to the low total pressures used. In the case of spacesuits, the partial pressure in the breathing gas is, in general, about 30 kPa (1.4 times normal), and the resulting partial pressure in the astronaut's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level partial pressure.

Oxygen toxicity to the lungs and <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a> can also occur in deep <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> and <a href="surface%20supplied%20diving">surface supplied diving</a>. Prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an partial pressure more than 60 kPa can eventually lead to permanent <a href="pulmonary%20fibrosis">pulmonary fibrosis</a>. Exposure to a partial pressures greater than 160 kPa (about 1.6 atm) may lead to convulsions (normally fatal for divers). Acute oxygen toxicity (causing seizures, its most feared effect for divers) can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21% at or more of depth; the same thing can occur by breathing 100% at only .

Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion. <a href="Fire">Fire</a> and <a href="explosion">explosion</a> hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and <a href="fuel">fuel</a>s are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, is needed to trigger combustion. Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion.

Concentrated will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically. <a href="Steel">Steel</a> pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> will act as a fuel; and therefore the design and manufacture of systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized. The fire that killed the <a href="Apollo%201">Apollo 1</a> crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure, instead of the normal pressure that would be used in a mission.

Liquid oxygen spills, if allowed to soak into organic matter, such as <a href="wood">wood</a>, <a href="petrochemical">petrochemical</a>s, and <a href="asphalt">asphalt</a> can cause these materials to <a href="Detonation">detonate</a> unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact.

The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated <a href="USD">$</a>652 million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies in the wake of the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) activated 11 of its <a href="FEMA%20Urban%20Search%20and%20Rescue%20Task%20Force">Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces</a>, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. Until the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, the Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in the history of the United States, and remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in the country's history.

Within 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by <a href="Oklahoma%20Highway%20Patrol">Oklahoma Highway Patrol</a>man Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> and a <a href="Militia%20organizations%20in%20the%20United%20States">U.S. militia movement</a> sympathizer, had detonated a <a href="Ryder">Ryder</a> rental truck full of explosives parked in front of the building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the <a href="U.S.%20federal%20government">U.S. federal government</a> and unhappy about its handling of the <a href="Ruby%20Ridge">Ruby Ridge</a> incident in 1992 and the <a href="Waco%20siege">Waco siege</a> in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the <a href="Branch%20Davidian">Branch Davidian</a> compound in <a href="Waco%2C%20Texas">Waco, Texas</a>.

The official investigation, known as "OKBOMB", saw FBI agents conduct 28,000 interviews, amass 3.5 short tons (3,200 kg) of evidence, and collected nearly one billion pieces of information. The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997. McVeigh was <a href="Capital%20punishment">executed</a> by <a href="lethal%20injection">lethal injection</a> on June 11, 2001, and Nichols was sentenced to <a href="Life%20imprisonment">life in prison</a> in 2004. Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols; Michael was sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to warn the United States government, and Lori received immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony.

As a result of the bombing, the U.S. Congress passed the <a href="Antiterrorism%20and%20Effective%20Death%20Penalty%20Act%20of%201996">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996</a>, which tightened the standards for <a href="habeas%20corpus%20in%20the%20United%20States">habeas corpus in the United States</a>, as well as <a href="United%20States%20federal%20building%20security">legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings</a> to deter future terrorist attacks. On April 19, 2000, the <a href="Oklahoma%20City%20National%20Memorial">Oklahoma City National Memorial</a> was dedicated on the site of the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims of the bombing. Remembrance services are held every year on April 19, at the time of the explosion.

The chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, met in 1988 at <a href="Fort%20Benning">Fort Benning</a> during <a href="Recruit%20training">basic training</a> for the U.S. Army. Michael Fortier, McVeigh's accomplice, was his Army roommate. The three shared interests in <a href="survivalism">survivalism</a>. They expressed anger at the federal government's handling of the 1992 <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) standoff with <a href="Randy%20Weaver">Randy Weaver</a> at <a href="Ruby%20Ridge">Ruby Ridge</a> as well as the <a href="Waco%20siege">Waco siege</a> – a 1993 51-day standoff between the FBI and <a href="Branch%20Davidian">Branch Davidian</a> members which began with a botched <a href="Bureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20and%20Firearms">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms</a> (ATF) attempt to execute a <a href="search%20warrant">search warrant</a> leading to a fire fight and ended with the burning and shooting deaths of <a href="David%20Koresh">David Koresh</a> and 75 others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff, and then again after its conclusion. McVeigh later decided to bomb a federal building as a response to the raids.

McVeigh later said that he had contemplated assassinating Attorney General <a href="Janet%20Reno">Janet Reno</a>, <a href="Lon%20Horiuchi">Lon Horiuchi</a>, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three <a href="Federal%20law%20enforcement%20in%20the%20United%20States">federal law enforcement agencies</a>: the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20and%20Firearms">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms</a> (ATF), the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), or the <a href="Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">Secret Service</a> or the <a href="United%20States%20Marshals%20Service">U.S. Marshals Service</a>, as a bonus.

A resident of <a href="Kingman%2C%20Arizona">Kingman, Arizona</a>, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock, Arkansas</a>, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The Murrah building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group <a href="The%20Covenant%2C%20The%20Sword%2C%20and%20the%20Arm%20of%20the%20Lord">The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord</a>, including founder <a href="James%20Ellison%20%28polygamist%29">James Ellison</a> and <a href="Richard%20Snell%20%28criminal%29">Richard Snell</a>. The group had plotted to park "a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer." After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing.

The nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for <a href="Alfred%20P.%20Murrah">a federal judge</a> and housed fourteen federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps. The Murrah building was chosen for its glass front – which was expected to shatter under the impact of the blast – and its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street, which might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. In addition, McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. The attack was planned to take place on April 19, 1995, to coincide with the 2nd anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a>.

McVeigh and Nichols purchased or stole the materials they needed to manufacture the bomb, which they stored in rented sheds. In August 1994, McVeigh obtained nine <a href="Kinestik">Kinestik</a>s from gun collector Roger E. Moore, and ignited the devices with Nichols outside Nichols's home in <a href="Herington%2C%20Kansas">Herington, Kansas</a>. On September 30, 1994, Nichols bought forty bags of <a href="ammonium%20nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> fertilizer from Mid-Kansas Coop in <a href="McPherson%2C%20Kansas">McPherson, Kansas</a>, enough to fertilize of farmland at a rate of of nitrogen per acre (.4 ha), an amount commonly used for corn. Nichols bought an additional bag on October 18, 1994. McVeigh approached Fortier and asked him to assist with the bombing project, but he refused.

McVeigh and Nichols then robbed Moore in his home of $60,000 worth of guns, gold, silver, and jewels, transporting the property in the victim's own van. McVeigh wrote a letter to Moore in which he claimed that the robbery had been committed by government agents. Items stolen from Moore were later found in Nichols' home and in a storage shed that he had rented.

In October 1994, McVeigh showed Michael Fortier and his wife, Lori, a diagram he had drawn of the bomb he wanted to build. McVeigh planned to construct a bomb containing more than of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, mixed with about of liquid <a href="nitromethane">nitromethane</a> and of <a href="Tovex">Tovex</a>. Including the weight of the sixteen <a href="55%20gallon%20drum">55-U.S.-gallon drums</a> in which the explosive mixture was to be packed, the bomb would have a combined weight of about . McVeigh had originally intended to use <a href="hydrazine">hydrazine</a> rocket fuel, but it proved to be too expensive. During the <a href="O%27Reilly%20Auto%20Parts">Chief Auto Parts Nationals</a> <a href="National%20Hot%20Rod%20Association">National Hot Rod Association</a> <a href="NHRA%20Mello%20Yello%20Drag%20Racing%20Series">Drag Racing Championship Series</a> event at the <a href="Texas%20Motorplex">Texas Motorplex</a>, McVeigh posed as a motorcycle racer and initially attempted to purchase drums of nitromethane on the pretense that he and some fellow bikers needed the fuel for racing, despite the lack of nitromethane-powered motorcycles at the meeting, and not having an NHRA competitors' license. Denied by one representative, Steve LeSeuer, due to LeSeur's suspicions of McVeigh's actions and attitudes, he was then permitted to purchase three barrels from another representative, Tim Chambers. Chambers questioned the purchase of three barrels when typically only 1-5 gallons of nitromethane, he noted, would be purchased by a Top Fuel Harley rider, even though the class was not raced that weekend. LeSeuer reported the incident to the FBI immediately after rejecting McVeigh's request.

McVeigh rented a storage space in which he stockpiled seven crates of Tovex sausages, 80 spools of <a href="Shock%20tube%20detonator">shock tube</a>, and 500 electric <a href="blasting%20cap">blasting cap</a>s, which he and Nichols had stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarry in <a href="Marion%2C%20Kansas">Marion, Kansas</a>. He decided not to steal any of the of <a href="ANFO">ANFO</a> (ammonium nitrate/fuel oil) he found at the scene, as he did not believe it to be powerful enough (although he did obtain seventeen bags of ANFO from another source for use in the bomb). McVeigh made a prototype bomb which was detonated in the desert to avoid detection.

Later, speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations, he said, "You learn how to handle killing in the military. I face the consequences, but you learn to accept it." He compared his actions to the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>, rather than the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, reasoning it was necessary to prevent more lives from being lost.

On April 14, 1995, McVeigh paid for a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in <a href="Junction%20City%2C%20Kansas">Junction City, Kansas</a>. The following day he rented a 1993 <a href="Ford%20F-700">Ford F-700</a> truck from <a href="Ryder">Ryder</a> under the name Robert D. Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, and because it reminded him of the <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a> warriors of "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>". On April 16, 1995, he drove to Oklahoma City with fellow conspirator Terry Nichols where he parked a getaway car several blocks away from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols's blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16. After removing the license plate from the car, he left a note covering the <a href="Vehicle%20Identification%20Number">Vehicle Identification Number</a> (VIN) plate that read, "Not abandoned. Please do not tow. Will move by April 23. (Needs battery & cable)." Both men then returned to Kansas.

On April 17–18, 1995, McVeigh and Nichols removed the bomb supplies from their storage unit in <a href="Herington%2C%20Kansas">Herington, Kansas</a>, where Nichols lived, and loaded them into a Ryder rental truck. They then drove to Geary Lake State Park, where they nailed boards onto the floor of the truck to hold the 13 barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic buckets and a bathroom scale. Each filled barrel weighed nearly . McVeigh added more explosives to the driver's side of the cargo bay, which he could ignite (killing himself in the process) at close range with his <a href="Glock%2021">Glock 21</a> pistol in case the primary fuses failed. During McVeigh's trial, Lori Fortier (the wife of Michael Fortier) stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to form a <a href="shaped%20charge">shaped charge</a>. This was achieved by <a href="wikt%3Atamp">tamping</a> the aluminum side panel of the truck with bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building. Specifically, McVeigh arranged the barrels in the shape of a backwards J; he later said that for pure destructive power, he would have put the barrels on the side of the cargo bay closest to the Murrah Building; however, such an unevenly distributed load might have broken an axle, flipped the truck over, or at least caused it to lean to one side, which could have drawn attention. All or most of the barrels of <a href="ANNM">ANNM</a> contained metal cylinders of <a href="acetylene">acetylene</a> intended to increase the fireball and the <a href="brisance">brisance</a> of the explosion.

McVeigh then added a dual-fuse ignition system accessible from the truck's front cab. He drilled two holes in the cab of the truck under the seat, while two holes were also drilled in the body of the truck. One green cannon fuse was run through each hole into the cab. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank tubing conduit to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around of high-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarry. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's <a href="livery">livery</a>, and duct-taped in place to the wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubes, the of Tovex Blastrite Gel "sausages", which would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13 filled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, and four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used for manufacturing the bomb were left in the truck to be destroyed in the blast. After finishing the truck bomb, the two men separated; Nichols returned home to Herington and McVeigh traveled with the truck to Junction City.

McVeigh's original plan had been to detonate the bomb at 11:00 a.m., but at dawn on April 19, 1995, he decided instead to destroy the building at 9:00 a.m. As he drove toward the Murrah Federal Building in the Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with him an envelope containing pages from "<a href="The%20Turner%20Diaries">The Turner Diaries</a>" – a fictional account of <a href="White%20supremacy">white supremacists</a> who ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a truck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with the motto of the Commonwealth of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, "<a href="Sic%20semper%20tyrannis">Sic semper tyrannis</a>" ("Thus always to tyrants", according to legend what Brutus said as he <a href="Assassination%20of%20Julius%20Caesar">assassinated Julius Caesar</a>, also shouted by <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a> immediately after the <a href="assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">assassination of Abraham Lincoln</a>) and "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants" (from <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the Thomas Jefferson slogan, "When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny." Underneath, McVeigh had written, "Maybe now, there will be liberty!" with a hand-copied quote by <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> asserting that a man has a right to kill someone who takes away his liberty.

McVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50 a.m. At 8:57 a.m., the Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera that had recorded Nichols's pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards the Murrah Federal Building. At the same moment, McVeigh lit the five-minute fuse. Three minutes later, still a block away, he lit the two-minute fuse. He parked the Ryder truck in a drop-off zone situated under the building's day-care center, exited and locked the truck, and as he headed to his getaway vehicle, dropped the keys to the truck a few blocks away.

At 9:02 a.m. (14:02 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>), the Ryder truck, containing over of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and diesel fuel mixture, detonated in front of the north side of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. 168 people were killed and hundreds more injured. One third of the building was destroyed by the explosion, which created a , crater on NW 5th Street next to the building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a 4-block radius, and shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings. The broken glass alone accounted for 5% of the death total and 69% of the injuries outside the Murrah Federal Building. The blast destroyed or burned 86 cars around the site. The destruction of the buildings left several hundred people homeless and shut down a number of offices in downtown Oklahoma City. The explosion was estimated to have caused at least $652 million worth of damage.

The effects of the blast were equivalent to over of <a href="trinitrotoluene">TNT</a>, and could be heard and felt up to away. <a href="Seismometer">Seismometer</a>s at the <a href="Science%20Museum%20Oklahoma">Omniplex Science Museum</a> in Oklahoma City, away, and in <a href="Norman%2C%20Oklahoma">Norman, Oklahoma</a>, away, recorded the blast as measuring approximately 3.0 on the <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">Richter magnitude scale</a>.

Initially, the FBI had three hypotheses about responsibility for the bombing: international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the <a href="1993%20World%20Trade%20Center%20bombing">World Trade Center bombing</a>; a <a href="drug%20cartel">drug cartel</a>, carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents in the building's DEA office; and anti-government radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.
McVeigh was arrested within 90 minutes of the explosion, as he was traveling north on <a href="Interstate%2035">Interstate 35</a> near <a href="Perry%2C%20Oklahoma">Perry</a> in <a href="Noble%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Noble County</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>. <a href="Oklahoma%20Highway%20Patrol">Oklahoma State Trooper</a> Charlie Hanger stopped McVeigh for driving his yellow 1977 <a href="Mercury%20Marquis">Mercury Marquis</a> without a license plate, and arrested him for having a concealed weapon. For his home address, McVeigh falsely claimed he resided at Terry Nichols's brother James's house in Michigan. After booking McVeigh into jail, Hanger searched his police car and found a business card McVeigh had hidden while he was handcuffed. Written on the back of the card, which was from a Wisconsin military surplus store, were the words "TNT at $5 a stick. Need more." The card was later used as evidence during McVeigh's trial.

While investigating the <a href="Vehicle%20Identification%20Number">VIN</a> from an axle of the truck used in the explosion and the remnants of the license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, "People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use. That's what [McVeigh] did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him."
After an April 21, 1995, court hearing on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they continued their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off by the arrival of police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.

Federal agents obtained a <a href="search%20warrant">warrant</a> to search the house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with <a href="listening%20device">listening device</a>s. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned that he was being hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of "<a href="Hunter%20%28Pierce%20novel%29">Hunter</a>" (a 1989 novel by <a href="William%20Luther%20Pierce">William Luther Pierce</a>, the founder and chairman of the <a href="National%20Alliance%20%28United%20States%29">National Alliance</a>, a <a href="white%20nationalist">white nationalist</a> group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32 days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.

Ibrahim Ahmad, a Jordanian-American traveling from his home in Oklahoma City to visit family in Jordan on April 19, 1995, was also arrested, amid concern that Middle Eastern terrorists could have been behind the attack. Further investigation cleared Ahmad of any involvement in the bombing.

An estimated 646 people were inside the building when the bomb exploded. By the end of the day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168 confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.

The victims, including three pregnant women, ranged in age from three months to 73 years. Of the dead, 108 worked for the Federal government: Drug Enforcement Administration (5); Secret Service (6); Department of Housing and Urban Development (35); Department of Agriculture (7); Customs Office (2); Department of Transportation/Federal Highway (11); General Services Administration (2); and the Social Security Administration (40). Eight of the Federal government victims were Federal law enforcement agents. Of those law enforcement agents four were members of the <a href="U.S.%20Secret%20Service">U.S. Secret Service</a>, two were members of the <a href="U.S.%20Customs%20Service">U.S. Customs Service</a>, one was a member of the <a href="U.S.%20Drug%20Enforcement%20Administration">U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration</a>, and one was a member of the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Housing%20and%20Urban%20Development">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</a>. Six of the victims were <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">U.S. military</a> personnel; two members of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a>, two members of the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a>, two members of the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a>. The rest of the victims were <a href="civilians">civilians</a>, including 19 children, of whom 15 were in the America's Kids Day Care Center. The bodies of the 168 victims were identified at a temporary morgue set up at the scene. A team of 24 identified the victims using full-body X-rays, dental examinations, fingerprinting, blood tests, and <a href="Genetic%20fingerprinting">DNA testing</a>. More than 680 people were injured. The majority of the injuries were <a href="Abrasion%20%28medical%29">abrasions</a>, severe burns, and <a href="bone%20fracture">bone fracture</a>s.

McVeigh's later response to the range of casualties was: "I didn't define the rules of engagement in this conflict. The rules, if not written down, are defined by the aggressor. It was brutal, no holds barred. Women and kids were killed at Waco and Ruby Ridge. You put back in [the government's] faces exactly what they're giving out."

At 9:03 a.m., the first of over 1,800 <a href="9-1-1">9-1-1</a> calls related to the bombing was received by <a href="Emergency%20Medical%20Services%20Authority">Emergency Medical Services Authority</a> (EMSA). By that time, EMSA ambulances, police, and firefighters had heard the blast and were already headed to the scene. Nearby civilians, who had also witnessed or heard the blast, arrived to assist the victims and emergency workers. Within 23 minutes of the bombing, the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) was set up, consisting of representatives from the state departments of public safety, human services, military, health, and education. Assisting the SEOC were agencies including the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service%20%28United%20States%29">National Weather Service</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a>, the <a href="Civil%20Air%20Patrol">Civil Air Patrol</a>, and the <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a>. Immediate assistance also came from 465 members of the <a href="Oklahoma%20National%20Guard">Oklahoma National Guard</a>, who arrived within the hour to provide security, and from members of the Department of Civil Emergency Management.

The EMS command post was set up almost immediately following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and decontamination. A simple plan/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle a large number of patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner's office, and measures for a long-term medical operation needed to be established. The triage center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there. Two hundred and ten patients were transported from the primary triage center to nearby hospitals within the first couple hours following the bombing.

Within the first hour, 50 people were rescued from the Murrah Federal Building. Victims were sent to every hospital in the area. The day of the bombing, 153 people were treated at St. Anthony Hospital, eight blocks from the blast, over 70 people were treated at Presbyterian Hospital, 41 people were treated at University Hospital, and 18 people were treated at Children's Hospital. Temporary silences were observed at the blast site so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heartbeats could be used to locate survivors. In some cases, limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics (avoided because of the potential to induce coma) in order to free those trapped under rubble. The scene had to be periodically evacuated as the police received tips claiming that other bombs had been planted in the building.

At 10:28 a.m., rescuers found what they believed to be a second bomb. Some rescue workers refused to leave until police ordered the mandatory evacuation of a four-block area around the site. The device was determined to be a three-foot (.9-m) long <a href="BGM-71%20TOW">TOW missile</a> used in the training of federal agents and bomb-sniffing dogs; although actually inert, it had been marked "live" in order to mislead arms traffickers in a planned law enforcement sting. On examination the missile was determined to be inert, and relief efforts resumed 45 minutes later. The last survivor, a 15-year-old girl found under the base of the collapsed building, was rescued at around 7:00 p.m.

In the days following the blast, over 12,000 people participated in relief and rescue operations. The <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) activated 11 of its <a href="FEMA%20Urban%20Search%20and%20Rescue%20Task%20Force">Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces</a>, bringing in 665 rescue workers. One nurse was killed in the rescue attempt after she was hit on the head by debris, and 26 other rescuers were hospitalized because of various injuries. Twenty-four <a href="Police%20dog">K-9</a> units and out-of-state dogs were brought in to search for survivors and bodies in the building debris. In an effort to recover additional bodies, of rubble were removed from the site each day from April 24 to April 29.
Rescue and recovery efforts were concluded at 12:05 a.m. on May 5, by which time the bodies of all but three of the victims had been recovered. For safety reasons, the building was initially slated to be demolished shortly afterward. McVeigh's attorney, <a href="Stephen%20Jones%20%28attorney%29">Stephen Jones</a>, filed a motion to delay the demolition until the defense team could examine the site in preparation for the trial. At 7:02 a.m. on May 23, more than a month after the bombing, the Murrah Federal building was demolished. The EMS Command Center remained active and was staffed 24 hours a day until the demolition of the Federal Murrah Building. The final three bodies to be recovered were those of two credit union employees and a customer. For several days after the building's demolition, trucks hauled away of debris a day from the site. Some of the debris was used as evidence in the conspirators' trials, incorporated into memorials, donated to local schools, or sold to raise funds for relief efforts.

The national humanitarian response was immediate, and in some cases even overwhelming. Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows, bottled water, helmet lights, knee pads, rain gear, and even football helmets were donated. The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop-off centers were set up to accept and sort the goods. The Oklahoma Restaurant Association, which was holding a trade show in the city, assisted rescue workers by providing 15,000 to 20,000 meals over a ten-day period.

<a href="The%20Salvation%20Army">The Salvation Army</a> served over 100,000 meals and provided over 100,000 ponchos, gloves, hard hats, and knee pads to rescue workers. Local residents and those from further afield responded to the requests for <a href="blood%20donation">blood donation</a>s. Of the over 9,000 units of blood donated 131 units were used; the rest were stored in <a href="blood%20bank">blood bank</a>s.

At 9:45 a.m., Governor <a href="Frank%20Keating">Frank Keating</a> declared a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a> and ordered all non-essential workers in the Oklahoma City area to be released from their duties for their safety. <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> learned about the bombing at around 9:30 a.m. while he was meeting with Turkish Prime Minister <a href="Tansu%20%C3%87iller">Tansu Çiller</a> at the White House. Before addressing the nation, President Clinton considered grounding all planes in the Oklahoma City area to prevent the bombers from escaping by air, but decided against it. At 4:00 p.m., President Clinton declared a federal emergency in Oklahoma City and spoke to the nation: 

He ordered that flags for all federal buildings be flown at <a href="half-staff">half-staff</a> for 30 days in remembrance of the victims. Four days later, on April 23, 1995, Clinton spoke from Oklahoma City.

No major federal financial assistance was made available to the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing, but the Murrah Fund set up in the wake of the bombing attracted over $300,000 in federal grants. Over $40 million was donated to the city to aid disaster relief and to compensate the victims. Funds were initially distributed to families who needed it to get back on their feet, and the rest was held in trust for longer-term medical and psychological needs. By 2005, $18 million of the donations remained, some of which was earmarked to provide a college education for each of the 219 children who lost one or both parents in the bombing. A committee chaired by Daniel Kurtenbach of <a href="Goodwill%20Industries">Goodwill Industries</a> provided financial assistance to the survivors.

International reactions to the bombing varied. President Clinton received many messages of sympathy, including those from <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Queen Elizabeth II</a> of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Yasser%20Arafat">Yasser Arafat</a> of the <a href="Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization">Palestine Liberation Organization</a>, and <a href="P.%20V.%20Narasimha%20Rao">Narasimha Rao</a> of <a href="India">India</a>. <a href="Iran">Iran</a> condemned the bombing as an attack on innocent people, but also blamed the U.S. government's policies for inciting it. Other condolences came from <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, and the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, among other nations and organizations.

Several countries offered to assist in both the rescue efforts and the investigation. <a href="France">France</a> offered to send a special rescue unit, and <a href="Israel">Israel</a>i Prime Minister <a href="Yitzhak%20Rabin">Yitzhak Rabin</a> offered to send agents with anti-terrorist expertise to help in the investigation. President Clinton declined Israel's offer, believing that accepting it would increase anti-Muslim sentiments and endanger <a href="Islam%20in%20the%20United%20States">Muslim-Americans</a>.

In the wake of the bombing, the national media focused on the fact that 19 of the victims had been babies and children, many in the day-care center. At the time of the bombing, there were 100 day-care centers in the United States in 7,900 federal buildings. McVeigh later stated that he was unaware of the day-care center when choosing the building as a target, and if he had known "... it might have given me pause to switch targets. That's a large amount of <a href="collateral%20damage">collateral damage</a>." The FBI stated that McVeigh scouted the interior of the building in December 1994 and likely knew of the day-care center before the bombing. In April 2010, Joseph Hartzler, the prosecutor at McVeigh's trial, questioned how he could have decided to pass over a prior target building because of an included florist shop but at the Murrah building not "... notice that there's a child day-care center there, that there was a credit union there and a Social Security office?"

Schools across the country were dismissed early and ordered closed. A photograph of firefighter Chris Fields emerging from the rubble with infant Baylee Almon, who later died in a nearby hospital, was reprinted worldwide and became a symbol of the attack. The photo, taken by bank employee Charles H. Porter IV, won the 1996 <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> for Spot News Photography and appeared on newspapers and magazines for months following the attack.
Aren Almon Kok, mother of Baylee Almon, said of the photo: "It was very hard to go to stores because they are in the check out aisle. It was always there. It was devastating. Everybody had seen my daughter dead. And that's all she became to them. She was a symbol. She was the girl in the fireman's arms. But she was a real person that got left behind."

The images and media reports of children dying terrorized many children who, as demonstrated by later research, showed symptoms of <a href="post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>. Children became a primary focus of concern in the mental health response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of middle and high school students conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Children were also affected through the loss of parents in the bombing. Many children lost one or more parents in the blast, with a reported seven children that lost their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally. One interview revealed the sleepless nights and obsession with death of one of the at least ten orphaned children.

President Clinton stated that after seeing images of babies being pulled from the wreckage, he was "beyond angry" and wanted to "put [his] fist through the television". Clinton and his wife <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary</a> requested that aides talk to child care specialists about how to communicate with the children regarding the bombing. President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing, saying: "I don't want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing ... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood and we are going to get through this". On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40 federal agency employees and their children, and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast, addressed their concerns.

Hundreds of news trucks and members of the press arrived at the site to cover the story. The press immediately noticed that the bombing took place on the second anniversary of the <a href="Waco%20Siege">Waco incident</a>. Many initial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Islamic terrorists, such as those who had masterminded the <a href="1993%20World%20Trade%20Center%20bombing">1993 World Trade Center bombing</a>. Some responded to these reports by attacking Muslims and people of Arab descent.

Before any evidence could be introduced to say otherwise, the media presented stories to the public that accused individuals within Middle Eastern groups. At this time in America, stereotypes that focused on the Arab race had affected many American Arabs within the United States. These stereotypes may have impacted how individuals acted after the bombing, and can explain why the media assumed that Middle Eastern groups were responsible. In the case of the Oklahoma City Bombing, Hamzi Moghrabi, chairman of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, blamed the media for the attacks on Muslims and Arabs that took place just days after the bombing.

As the rescue effort wound down, the media interest shifted to the investigation, arrests, and trials of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, and on the search for an additional suspect named "John Doe Number Two." Several witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect, who did not resemble Nichols, with McVeigh.

Those who expressed sympathy for McVeigh typically described his deed as an act of war, as in the case of <a href="Gore%20Vidal">Gore Vidal</a>'s essay "The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh".

The <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) led the official investigation, known as OKBOMB, with <a href="Weldon%20L.%20Kennedy">Weldon L. Kennedy</a> acting as Special Agent in charge. Kennedy oversaw 900 federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel including 300 FBI agents, 200 officers from the <a href="Oklahoma%20City%20Police%20Department">Oklahoma City Police Department</a>, 125 members of the <a href="Oklahoma%20National%20Guard">Oklahoma National Guard</a>, and 55 officers from the <a href="Oklahoma%20Department%20of%20Public%20Safety">Oklahoma Department of Public Safety</a>. The crime task force was deemed the largest since the investigation into the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination">assassination of John F. Kennedy</a>. OKBOMB was the largest criminal case in America's history, with FBI agents conducting 28,000 interviews, amassing of evidence, and collecting nearly one billion pieces of information. Federal judge <a href="Richard%20Paul%20Matsch">Richard Paul Matsch</a> ordered that the venue for the trial be moved from Oklahoma City to <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, citing that the defendants would be unable to receive a fair trial in Oklahoma. The investigation led to the separate trials and convictions of McVeigh, Nichols, and Fortier.

Opening statements in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States</a> was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading "<a href="The%20Turner%20Diaries">The Turner Diaries</a>". His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the <a href="Brady%20Bill">Brady Bill</a>, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137 witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.

McVeigh was represented by a defense counsel team of six principal attorneys led by Stephen Jones. According to law professor Douglas O. Linder, McVeigh wanted Jones to present a "necessity defense" – which would argue that he was in "imminent danger" from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents). McVeigh argued that "imminent" does not mean "immediate": "If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's out past the orbit of Pluto, it's not an immediate threat to Earth, but it is an imminent threat." Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution's case in an attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspiracy, and sought to present him as "the designated patsy", but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible. In addition to arguing that the bombing could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks. Jones presented 25 witnesses over a one-week period, including Dr. <a href="Frederic%20Whitehurst">Frederic Whitehurst</a>. Although Whitehurst described the FBI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated.

A key point of contention in the case was the unmatched left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined to be that of Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.

Numerous damaging leaks, which appeared to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial. A <a href="gag%20order">gag order</a> was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.

The jury deliberated for 23 hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh was found guilty on 11 counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced sentence of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000 documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge <a href="Richard%20Paul%20Matsch">Richard Paul Matsch</a> ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. After President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by <a href="lethal%20injection">lethal injection</a> at the <a href="Federal%20Correctional%20Complex%2C%20Terre%20Haute">Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute</a> in <a href="Terre%20Haute%2C%20Indiana">Terre Haute, Indiana</a>, on June 11, 2001. The execution was transmitted on <a href="closed-circuit%20television">closed-circuit television</a> so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first <a href="Capital%20punishment%20by%20the%20United%20States%20federal%20government">federal execution</a> in 38 years.

Nichols stood trial twice. He was first tried by the federal government in 1997 and found guilty of conspiring to build a weapon of mass destruction and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter of federal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998 to life without parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 sought a death-penalty conviction on 161 counts of first-degree murder (160 non-federal agent victims and one fetus). On May 26, 2004 the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge <a href="Steven%20W.%20Taylor">Steven W. Taylor</a> then determined the sentence of 161 consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. In March 2005, FBI investigators, acting on a tip, searched a buried crawl space in Nichols's former house and found additional explosives missed in the preliminary search after Nichols was arrested.

Michael and Lori Fortier were considered accomplices for their foreknowledge of the planning of the bombing. In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver's license which was later used to rent the Ryder truck. Fortier agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to twelve years in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack. On January 20, 2006, after serving ten and a half years of his sentence, including time already served, Fortier was released for good behavior into the <a href="United%20States%20Federal%20Witness%20Protection%20Program">Witness Protection Program</a> and given a new identity.

No "John Doe #2" was ever identified, nothing conclusive was ever reported regarding the owner of the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Although the defense teams in both McVeigh's and Nichols's trials suggested that others were involved, Judge Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: "You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building, and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?" On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else. Financing? Logistics? Specialized tech skills? Brainpower? Strategy? ... Show me where I needed a dark, mysterious 'Mr. X'!"

Within 48 hours of the attack, and with the assistance of the <a href="General%20Services%20Administration">General Services Administration</a> (GSA), the targeted federal offices were able to resume operations in other parts of the city. According to Mark Potok, director of Intelligence Project at the <a href="Southern%20Poverty%20Law%20Center">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>, his organization tracked another 60 domestic smaller-scale terrorism plots from 1995 to 2005. Several of the plots were uncovered and prevented while others caused various infrastructure damage, deaths, or other destruction. Potok revealed that in 1996 there were approximately 858 domestic militias and other antigovernment groups but the number had dropped to 152 by 2004. Shortly after the bombing, the FBI hired an additional 500 agents to investigate potential domestic terrorist attacks.

In the wake of the bombing the U.S. government enacted several pieces of legislation including the <a href="Antiterrorism%20and%20Effective%20Death%20Penalty%20Act%20of%201996">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996</a>. In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings. In response to passing the legislation, Clinton stated that "when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process, not on the outside looking in."

In the years since the bombing, scientists, security experts, and the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20Firearms%20and%20Explosives">ATF</a> have called on Congress to develop legislation that would require customers to produce identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers to maintain records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quantities of the fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevada and South Carolina require identification from purchasers. In June 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to its manufacturer. In 2008, <a href="Honeywell">Honeywell</a> announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would not detonate when mixed with fuel oil. The company got assistance from the <a href="Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security">Department of Homeland Security</a> to develop the fertilizer (Sulf-N 26) for commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make the fertilizer less explosive.

In the decade following the bombing, there was criticism of Oklahoma public schools for not requiring the bombing to be covered in the curriculum of mandatory Oklahoma history classes. "Oklahoma History" is a one-semester course required by state law for graduation from high school; however, the bombing was only covered for one to two pages at most in textbooks. The state's PASS standards (Priority Academic Student Skills) did not require that a student learn about the bombing, and focused more on other subjects such as corruption and the <a href="Dust%20Bowl">Dust Bowl</a>. On April 6, 2010, "House Bill 2750" was signed by Governor <a href="Brad%20Henry">Brad Henry</a>, requiring the bombing to be entered into the school curriculum for Oklahoma, U.S. and world history classes.

On the signing, Governor Henry said "Although the events of April 19, 1995 may be etched in our minds and in the minds of Oklahomans who remember that day, we have a generation of Oklahomans that has little to no memory of the events of that day ... We owe it to the victims, the survivors and all of the people touched by this tragic event to remember April 19, 1995 and understand what it meant and still means to this state and this nation."

In the weeks following the bombing the federal government ordered that all federal buildings in all major cities be surrounded with prefabricated <a href="Jersey%20barrier">Jersey barrier</a>s to prevent similar attacks. As part of a longer-term plan for <a href="United%20States%20federal%20building%20security">United States federal building security</a> most of those temporary barriers have since been replaced with permanent and more aesthetically considerate security barriers, which are driven deep into the ground for sturdiness. Furthermore, all new federal buildings must now be constructed with truck-resistant barriers and with deep setbacks from surrounding streets to minimize their vulnerability to truck bombs. FBI buildings, for instance, must be set back from traffic. The total cost of improving security in federal buildings across the country in response to the bombing reached over $600 million.

The Murrah Federal Building had been considered so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued "Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities", also known as "The Marshals Report", the findings of which resulted in a thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300 federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52 security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent <a href="progressive%20collapse">progressive collapse</a>.

The attack led to engineering improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces, improvements which were incorporated into the design of Oklahoma City's new federal building. The <a href="National%20Geographic%20Channel">National Geographic Channel</a> documentary series "<a href="Seconds%20From%20Disaster">Seconds From Disaster</a>" suggested that the Murrah Federal Building would probably have survived the blast had it been built according to California's earthquake design codes.

McVeigh believed that the bomb attack had a positive impact on government policy. In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the <a href="Montana%20Freemen">Montana Freemen</a> standoff in 1996, the government's $3.1 million settlement with <a href="Randy%20Weaver">Randy Weaver</a> and his surviving children four months after the bombing, and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the Branch Davidian compound. McVeigh stated, "Once you bloody the bully's nose, and he knows he's going to be punched again, he's not coming back around."

A variety of <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theories</a> have been proposed about the events surrounding the bombing. Some theories allege that individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knew of the impending bombing and intentionally failed to act. Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. According to both a situation report compiled by the <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> and a memo issued by the <a href="United%20States%20Atlantic%20Command">United States Atlantic Command</a> the day following the attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further theories focus on additional conspirators involved with the bombing. Additional theories claim the bombing was carried out by the government in order to frame the <a href="Militia%20organizations%20in%20the%20United%20States">militia movement</a> or to provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a <a href="scapegoat">scapegoat</a>. Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo-Nazis, were involved in the bombing. Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories.

Once the explosion took place at the Alfred P. Murrah building, chaotic response filled the surrounding streets. Those who were able to flee the Murrah building did so, while others, stuck in the rubble, awaited the assistance of rescue workers and volunteers. As reported on CNN, other federal buildings in the downtown area were not fully evacuated, but those who were able to leave the city were encouraged to do so. This traffic, along with the people leaving places around the Murrah Building clogged streets, delaying the arrival of rescue crews and relief agencies.
Several agencies, including the Federal Highway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City have evaluated the emergency response actions to the bombing, and have proposed plans for a better response in addition to addressing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded streets, and the number of response agencies sent to the location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of the operations others were conducting, thus creating strife and delays in the search and rescue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication and single bases for agencies would better the aid of those in disastrous situations.
Following the events of September 11, 2001, with consideration of other events including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administration proposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These highlighted routes would allow paths for emergency crews and government agencies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians out, and rescue workers in, the number of casualties will hopefully be decreased.

For two years after the bombing the only memorials to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding the site of the building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350 members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing. On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624 submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29 million, which was raised by public and private funds. The memorial is part of the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg. It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years after the bombing. Within the first year, it had 700,000 visitors.

The memorial includes a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates, one inscribed with the time 9:01, the other with 9:03, the pool representing the moment of the blast. On the south end of the memorial is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs – one for each person lost, arranged according to what floor of the building they were on. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The seats of the children killed are smaller than those of the adults lost. On the opposite side is the "survivor tree", part of the building's original landscaping that survived the blast and fires that followed it. The memorial left part of the foundation of the building intact, allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction. Part of the chain link fence put in place around the site of the blast, which had attracted over 800,000 personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation, is now on the western edge of the memorial. North of the memorial is the <a href="India%20Temple%20Shrine%20Building">Journal Record Building</a>, which now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, an affiliate of the National Park Service. The building also contains the <a href="National%20Memorial%20Institute%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Terrorism">National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism</a>, a law enforcement training center.

<a href="St.%20Joseph%20Old%20Cathedral%20%28Oklahoma%20City%29">St. Joseph's Old Cathedral</a>, one of the first brick-and-mortar churches in the city, is located to the southwest of the memorial and was severely damaged by the blast. To commemorate the event, a statue and sculpture work entitled "And Jesus Wept" was installed adjacent to the Oklahoma City National Memorial. The work was dedicated in May 1997 and the church was rededicated on December 1 of the same year. The church, the statue, and the sculpture are not part of the Oklahoma City memorial.

An observance is held each year to remember the victims of the bombing. An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the bombing, the city held 24 days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02 a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168 seconds of silence – one second for each person who was killed as a result of the blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.

Vice President <a href="Dick%20Cheney">Dick Cheney</a>, former President Clinton, Oklahoma Governor <a href="Brad%20Henry">Brad Henry</a>, <a href="Frank%20Keating">Frank Keating</a>, Governor of Oklahoma at the time of the bombing, and other political dignitaries attended the service and gave speeches in which they emphasized that "goodness overcame evil". The relatives of the victims and the survivors of the blast also made note of it during the service at First <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a> in Oklahoma City.

President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> made note of the anniversary in a written statement, part of which echoed his remarks on the execution of Timothy McVeigh in 2001: "For the survivors of the crime and for the families of the dead the pain goes on." Bush was invited but did not attend the service because he was en route to <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield, Illinois</a>, to dedicate the <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20Presidential%20Library%20and%20Museum">Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum</a>. Cheney attended the service in his place.

Oxidative phosphorylation

Oxidative phosphorylation (UK , US or electron transport-linked phosphorylation) is the <a href="metabolic%20pathway">metabolic pathway</a> in which <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a>s use <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s to <a href="Redox">oxidize</a> <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>s, thereby releasing energy which is used to produce <a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate</a> (ATP). In most <a href="eukaryotes">eukaryotes</a>, this takes place inside <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>. Almost all <a href="aerobic%20organism">aerobic organism</a>s carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative <a href="fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">fermentation</a> processes such as <a href="anaerobic">anaerobic</a> <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a>.

During oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are transferred from <a href="reducing%20agent">electron donors</a> to <a href="oxidizing%20agent">electron acceptors</a> such as <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, in <a href="redox%20reaction">redox reaction</a>s. These redox reactions release energy, which is used to form ATP. In <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s, these redox reactions are carried out by a series of <a href="protein%20complex">protein complex</a>es within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, whereas, in <a href="prokaryote">prokaryote</a>s, these proteins are located in the cells' intermembrane space. These linked sets of proteins are called <a href="electron%20transport%20chain">electron transport chain</a>s. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, whereas in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of electron donors and acceptors.

The energy released by electrons flowing through this electron transport chain is used to transport <a href="proton">proton</a>s across the <a href="inner%20mitochondrial%20membrane">inner mitochondrial membrane</a>, in a process called "<a href="electron%20transport">electron transport</a>". This generates <a href="potential%20energy">potential energy</a> in the form of a <a href="pH">pH</a> gradient and an <a href="Membrane%20potential">electrical potential</a> across this membrane. This store of energy is tapped when protons flow back across the membrane and down the potential energy gradient, through a large enzyme called <a href="ATP%20synthase">ATP synthase</a>; this process is known as <a href="chemiosmosis">chemiosmosis</a>. The ATP synthase uses the energy to transform <a href="adenosine%20diphosphate">adenosine diphosphate</a> (ADP) into adenosine triphosphate, in a <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> reaction. The reaction is driven by the proton flow, which forces the <a href="rotation">rotation</a> of a part of the enzyme; the ATP synthase is a rotary mechanical motor.

Although oxidative phosphorylation is a vital part of metabolism, it produces <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen species</a> such as <a href="superoxide">superoxide</a> and <a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a>, which lead to propagation of <a href="Radical%20%28chemistry%29">free radicals</a>, damaging cells and contributing to <a href="disease">disease</a> and, possibly, <a href="aging">aging</a> (<a href="senescence">senescence</a>). The enzymes carrying out this metabolic pathway are also the target of many drugs and poisons that <a href="enzyme%20inhibitor">inhibit</a> their activities.

It is the terminal process of <a href="cellular%20respiration">cellular respiration</a> in eukaryotes and accounts for high ATP yield.

Oxidative phosphorylation works by using <a href="energy">energy</a>-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: The two sets of reactions are said to be "coupled". This means one cannot occur without the other. The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as <a href="NADH">NADH</a> to <a href="electron%20acceptor">electron acceptor</a>s such as <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, is an <a href="exergonic">exergonic</a> process – it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an <a href="endergonic">endergonic</a> process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called "<a href="chemiosmosis">chemiosmosis</a>". In practice, this is like a simple <a href="Electrical%20network">electric circuit</a>, with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. These enzymes are like a <a href="battery%20%28electricity%29">battery</a>, as they perform <a href="Work%20%28thermodynamics%29">work</a> to drive current through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an <a href="electrochemical%20gradient">electrochemical gradient</a> across the membrane, which is often called the "proton-motive force". It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H gradient, Δ<a href="pH">pH</a>) and a difference in <a href="electric%20potential">electric potential</a>, with the N-side having a negative charge.

ATP synthase releases this stored energy by completing the circuit and allowing protons to flow down the electrochemical gradient, back to the N-side of the membrane. The electrochemical gradient drives the rotation of part of the enzyme's structure and couples this motion to the synthesis of ATP.

The two components of the proton-motive force are <a href="thermodynamic">thermodynamic</a>ally equivalent: In mitochondria, the largest part of energy is provided by the potential; in <a href="alkaliphile">alkaliphile</a> bacteria the electrical energy even has to compensate for a counteracting inverse pH difference. Inversely, <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s operate mainly on ΔpH. However, they also require a small membrane potential for the kinetics of ATP synthesis. In the case of the <a href="Fusobacteria">fusobacterium</a> "<a href="Propionigenium%20modestum">Propionigenium modestum</a>" it drives the counter-rotation of subunits a and c of the F motor of ATP synthase.

The amount of energy released by oxidative phosphorylation is high, compared with the amount produced by <a href="anaerobic%20fermentation">anaerobic fermentation</a>. <a href="Glycolysis">Glycolysis</a> produces only 2 ATP molecules, but somewhere between 30 and 36 ATPs are produced by the oxidative phosphorylation of the 10 NADH and 2 succinate molecules made by converting one molecule of <a href="glucose">glucose</a> to carbon dioxide and water, while each cycle of <a href="beta%20oxidation">beta oxidation</a> of a <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a> yields about 14 ATPs. These ATP yields are theoretical maximum values; in practice, some protons leak across the membrane, lowering the yield of ATP.

The electron transport chain carries both protons and electrons, passing electrons from donors to acceptors, and transporting protons across a membrane. These processes use both soluble and protein-bound transfer molecules. In mitochondria, electrons are transferred within the intermembrane space by the water-<a href="soluble">soluble</a> electron transfer protein <a href="cytochrome%20c">cytochrome c</a>. This carries only electrons, and these are transferred by the reduction and oxidation of an <a href="iron">iron</a> atom that the protein holds within a <a href="heme">heme</a> group in its structure. Cytochrome c is also found in some bacteria, where it is located within the <a href="periplasmic%20space">periplasmic space</a>.

Within the inner mitochondrial membrane, the <a href="lipid">lipid</a>-soluble electron carrier <a href="coenzyme%20Q10">coenzyme Q10</a> (Q) carries both electrons and protons by a <a href="redox">redox</a> cycle. This small <a href="1%2C4-Benzoquinone">benzoquinone</a> molecule is very <a href="hydrophobe">hydrophobic</a>, so it diffuses freely within the membrane. When Q accepts two electrons and two protons, it becomes reduced to the "<a href="Hydroquinone">ubiquinol</a>" form (QH); when QH releases two electrons and two protons, it becomes oxidized back to the "ubiquinone" (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced on one side of the membrane and QH oxidized on the other, ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across the membrane. Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as <a href="vitamin%20K">menaquinone</a>, in addition to ubiquinone.

Within proteins, electrons are transferred between <a href="Flavin%20group">flavin</a> cofactors, iron–sulfur clusters, and cytochromes. There are several types of iron–sulfur cluster. The simplest kind found in the electron transfer chain consists of two iron atoms joined by two atoms of inorganic <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>; these are called [2Fe–2S] clusters. The second kind, called [4Fe–4S], contains a cube of four iron atoms and four sulfur atoms. Each iron atom in these clusters is coordinated by an additional <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>, usually by the sulfur atom of <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a>. Metal ion cofactors undergo redox reactions without binding or releasing protons, so in the electron transport chain they serve solely to transport electrons through proteins. Electrons move quite long distances through proteins by hopping along chains of these cofactors. This occurs by <a href="quantum%20tunnelling">quantum tunnelling</a>, which is rapid over distances of less than 1.4 m.

Many <a href="catabolic">catabolic</a> biochemical processes, such as <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a>, the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a>, and <a href="beta%20oxidation">beta oxidation</a>, produce the reduced <a href="coenzyme">coenzyme</a> <a href="NADH">NADH</a>. This coenzyme contains electrons that have a high <a href="Standard%20electrode%20potential">transfer potential</a>; in other words, they will release a large amount of energy upon oxidation. However, the cell does not release this energy all at once, as this would be an uncontrollable reaction. Instead, the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy. This set of enzymes, consisting of complexes I through IV, is called the electron transport chain and is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. <a href="succinic%20acid">Succinate</a> is also oxidized by the electron transport chain, but feeds into the pathway at a different point.

In <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a>s, the enzymes in this electron transport system use the energy released from the oxidation of NADH to pump <a href="proton">proton</a>s across the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. This causes protons to build up in the <a href="intermembrane%20space">intermembrane space</a>, and generates an <a href="electrochemical%20gradient">electrochemical gradient</a> across the membrane. The energy stored in this potential is then used by ATP synthase to produce ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation in the eukaryotic mitochondrion is the best-understood example of this process. The mitochondrion is present in almost all eukaryotes, with the exception of anaerobic protozoa such as "<a href="Trichomonas%20vaginalis">Trichomonas vaginalis</a>" that instead reduce protons to hydrogen in a remnant mitochondrion called a <a href="hydrogenosome">hydrogenosome</a>.

<a href="NADH%20dehydrogenase">NADH-coenzyme Q oxidoreductase</a>, also known as "NADH dehydrogenase" or "complex I", is the first protein in the electron transport chain. Complex I is a giant <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> with the mammalian complex I having 46 subunits and a molecular mass of about 1,000 <a href="atomic%20mass%20unit">kilodaltons</a> (kDa). The structure is known in detail only from a bacterium; in most organisms the complex resembles a boot with a large "ball" poking out from the membrane into the mitochondrion. The genes that encode the individual proteins are contained in both the <a href="cell%20nucleus">cell nucleus</a> and the <a href="mitochondrial%20genome">mitochondrial genome</a>, as is the case for many enzymes present in the mitochondrion.

The reaction that is catalyzed by this enzyme is the two electron oxidation of <a href="Nicotinamide%20adenine%20dinucleotide">NADH</a> by <a href="coenzyme%20Q10">coenzyme Q10</a> or "ubiquinone" (represented as Q in the equation below), a lipid-soluble <a href="quinone">quinone</a> that is found in the mitochondrion membrane:

The start of the reaction, and indeed of the entire electron chain, is the binding of a NADH molecule to complex I and the donation of two electrons. The electrons enter complex I via a <a href="prosthetic%20group">prosthetic group</a> attached to the complex, <a href="flavin%20mononucleotide">flavin mononucleotide</a> (FMN). The addition of electrons to FMN converts it to its reduced form, FMNH. The electrons are then transferred through a series of <a href="iron-sulfur%20cluster">iron–sulfur clusters</a>: the second kind of prosthetic group present in the complex. There are both [2Fe–2S] and [4Fe–4S] iron–sulfur clusters in complex I.

As the electrons pass through this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Exactly how this occurs is unclear, but it seems to involve <a href="conformational%20change">conformational change</a>s in complex I that cause the protein to bind protons on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, the electrons are transferred from the chain of iron–sulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to <a href="ubiquinol">ubiquinol</a> (QH).

<a href="Succinate%20-%20coenzyme%20Q%20reductase">Succinate-Q oxidoreductase</a>, also known as "complex II" or "succinate dehydrogenase", is a second entry point to the electron transport chain. It is unusual because it is the only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound <a href="flavin%20adenine%20dinucleotide">flavin adenine dinucleotide</a> (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a <a href="heme">heme</a> group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes <a href="succinic%20acid">succinate</a> to <a href="Fumaric%20acid">fumarate</a> and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.

In some eukaryotes, such as the <a href="parasitic%20worm">parasitic worm</a> "<a href="Large%20roundworm%20of%20pigs">Ascaris suum</a>", an enzyme similar to complex II, fumarate reductase (menaquinol:fumarate
oxidoreductase, or QFR), operates in reverse to oxidize ubiquinol and reduce fumarate. This allows the worm to survive in the anaerobic environment of the <a href="large%20intestine">large intestine</a>, carrying out anaerobic oxidative phosphorylation with fumarate as the electron acceptor. Another unconventional function of complex II is seen in the <a href="malaria">malaria</a> parasite "<a href="Plasmodium%20falciparum">Plasmodium falciparum</a>". Here, the reversed action of complex II as an oxidase is important in regenerating ubiquinol, which the parasite uses in an unusual form of <a href="pyrimidine">pyrimidine</a> biosynthesis.

<a href="Electron-transferring-flavoprotein%20dehydrogenase">Electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase</a> (ETF-Q oxidoreductase), also known as "electron transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase", is a third entry point to the electron transport chain. It is an enzyme that accepts electrons from <a href="electron-transferring%20flavoprotein">electron-transferring flavoprotein</a> in the mitochondrial matrix, and uses these electrons to reduce ubiquinone. This enzyme contains a <a href="Flavin%20group">flavin</a> and a [4Fe–4S] cluster, but, unlike the other respiratory complexes, it attaches to the surface of the membrane and does not cross the lipid bilayer.

In mammals, this metabolic pathway is important in <a href="beta%20oxidation">beta oxidation</a> of <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s and catabolism of <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s and <a href="choline">choline</a>, as it accepts electrons from multiple <a href="acetyl-CoA">acetyl-CoA</a> dehydrogenases. In plants, ETF-Q oxidoreductase is also important in the metabolic responses that allow survival in extended periods of darkness.

<a href="Coenzyme%20Q%20-%20cytochrome%20c%20reductase">Q-cytochrome c oxidoreductase</a> is also known as "cytochrome c reductase", "cytochrome bc complex", or simply "complex III". In mammals, this enzyme is a <a href="protein%20dimer">dimer</a>, with each subunit complex containing 11 protein subunits, an [2Fe-2S] iron–sulfur cluster and three <a href="cytochrome">cytochrome</a>s: one <a href="cytochrome">cytochrome</a> c and two b <a href="cytochromes">cytochromes</a>. A cytochrome is a kind of electron-transferring protein that contains at least one <a href="heme">heme</a> group. The iron atoms inside complex III’s heme groups alternate between a reduced ferrous (+2) and oxidized ferric (+3) state as the electrons are transferred through the protein.

The reaction catalyzed by complex III is the oxidation of one molecule of <a href="ubiquinol">ubiquinol</a> and the reduction of two molecules of <a href="cytochrome%20c">cytochrome c</a>, a heme protein loosely associated with the mitochondrion. Unlike coenzyme Q, which carries two electrons, cytochrome c carries only one electron.

As only one of the electrons can be transferred from the QH donor to a cytochrome c acceptor at a time, the reaction mechanism of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes, and occurs in two steps called the <a href="Q%20cycle">Q cycle</a>. In the first step, the enzyme binds three substrates, first, QH, which is then oxidized, with one electron being passed to the second substrate, cytochrome c. The two protons released from QH pass into the intermembrane space. The third substrate is Q, which accepts the second electron from the QH and is reduced to Q, which is the <a href="semiquinone">ubisemiquinone</a> <a href="free%20radical">free radical</a>. The first two substrates are released, but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound. In the second step, a second molecule of QH is bound and again passes its first electron to a cytochrome c acceptor. The second electron is passed to the bound ubisemiquinone, reducing it to QH as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix. This QH is then released from the enzyme.

As coenzyme Q is reduced to ubiquinol on the inner side of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.

<a href="Cytochrome%20c%20oxidase">Cytochrome c oxidase</a>, also known as "complex IV", is the final protein complex in the electron transport chain. The mammalian enzyme has an extremely complicated structure and contains 13 subunits, two heme groups, as well as multiple metal ion cofactors – in all, three atoms of <a href="copper">copper</a>, one of <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> and one of <a href="zinc">zinc</a>.

This enzyme mediates the final reaction in the electron transport chain and transfers electrons to oxygen, while pumping protons across the membrane. The final <a href="electron%20acceptor">electron acceptor</a> oxygen, which is also called the "terminal electron acceptor", is reduced to water in this step. Both the direct pumping of protons and the consumption of matrix protons in the reduction of oxygen contribute to the proton gradient. The reaction catalyzed is the oxidation of cytochrome c and the reduction of oxygen:

Many eukaryotic organisms have electron transport chains that differ from the much-studied mammalian enzymes described above. For example, <a href="plant">plant</a>s have alternative NADH oxidases, which oxidize NADH in the cytosol rather than in the mitochondrial matrix, and pass these electrons to the ubiquinone pool. These enzymes do not transport protons, and, therefore, reduce ubiquinone without altering the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane.

Another example of a divergent electron transport chain is the "<a href="alternative%20oxidase">alternative oxidase</a>", which is found in <a href="plant">plant</a>s, as well as some <a href="fungus">fungi</a>, <a href="protist">protist</a>s, and possibly some animals. This enzyme transfers electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen.

The electron transport pathways produced by these alternative NADH and ubiquinone oxidases have lower <a href="adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a> yields than the full pathway. The advantages produced by a shortened pathway are not entirely clear. However, the alternative oxidase is produced in response to stresses such as cold, <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen species</a>, and infection by pathogens, as well as other factors that inhibit the full electron transport chain. Alternative pathways might, therefore, enhance an organisms' resistance to injury, by reducing <a href="oxidative%20stress">oxidative stress</a>.

The original model for how the respiratory chain complexes are organized was that they diffuse freely and independently in the mitochondrial membrane. However, recent data suggest that the complexes might form higher-order structures called supercomplexes or "<a href="respirasome">respirasome</a>s". In this model, the various complexes exist as organized sets of interacting enzymes. These associations might allow channeling of substrates between the various enzyme complexes, increasing the rate and efficiency of electron transfer. Within such mammalian supercomplexes, some components would be present in higher amounts than others, with some data suggesting a ratio between complexes I/II/III/IV and the ATP synthase of approximately 1:1:3:7:4. However, the debate over this supercomplex hypothesis is not completely resolved, as some data do not appear to fit with this model.

In contrast to the general similarity in structure and function of the electron transport chains in eukaryotes, <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="archaea">archaea</a> possess a large variety of electron-transfer enzymes. These use an equally wide set of chemicals as substrates. In common with eukaryotes, prokaryotic electron transport uses the energy released from the oxidation of a substrate to pump ions across a membrane and generate an electrochemical gradient. In the bacteria, oxidative phosphorylation in "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>" is understood in most detail, while archaeal systems are at present poorly understood.

The main difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic oxidative phosphorylation is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under a wide variety of environmental conditions. In "E. coli", for example, oxidative phosphorylation can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The <a href="Standard%20electrode%20potential%23Non-standard%20condition">midpoint potential</a> of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.

As shown above, "E. coli" can grow with reducing agents such as formate, hydrogen, or lactate as electron donors, and nitrate, DMSO, or oxygen as acceptors. The larger the difference in midpoint potential between an oxidizing and reducing agent, the more energy is released when they react. Out of these compounds, the succinate/fumarate pair is unusual, as its midpoint potential is close to zero. Succinate can therefore be oxidized to fumarate if a strong oxidizing agent such as oxygen is available, or fumarate can be reduced to succinate using a strong reducing agent such as formate. These alternative reactions are catalyzed by <a href="Succinate%20-%20coenzyme%20Q%20reductase">succinate dehydrogenase</a> and <a href="fumarate%20reductase">fumarate reductase</a>, respectively.

Some prokaryotes use redox pairs that have only a small difference in midpoint potential. For example, <a href="nitrification">nitrifying</a> bacteria such as "<a href="Nitrobacter">Nitrobacter</a>" oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in <a href="anabolism">anabolism</a>. This problem is solved by using a <a href="nitrite%20oxidoreductase">nitrite oxidoreductase</a> to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.

Prokaryotes control their use of these electron donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response to environmental conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool. This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together, linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a <a href="modular%20design">modular design</a>, with easily interchangeable sets of enzyme systems.

In addition to this metabolic diversity, prokaryotes also possess a range of <a href="isozyme">isozyme</a>s – different enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. For example, in "E. coli", there are two different types of ubiquinol oxidase using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Under highly aerobic conditions, the cell uses an oxidase with a low affinity for oxygen that can transport two protons per electron. However, if levels of oxygen fall, they switch to an oxidase that transfers only one proton per electron, but has a high affinity for oxygen.

ATP synthase, also called "complex V", is the final enzyme in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. This enzyme is found in all forms of life and functions in the same way in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The enzyme uses the energy stored in a proton gradient across a membrane to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> (P). Estimates of the number of protons required to synthesize one ATP have ranged from three to four, with some suggesting cells can vary this ratio, to suit different conditions.

This <a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> reaction is an <a href="chemical%20equilibrium">equilibrium</a>, which can be shifted by altering the proton-motive force. In the absence of a proton-motive force, the ATP synthase reaction will run from right to left, hydrolyzing ATP and pumping protons out of the matrix across the membrane. However, when the proton-motive force is high, the reaction is forced to run in the opposite direction; it proceeds from left to right, allowing protons to flow down their concentration gradient and turning ADP into ATP. Indeed, in the closely related <a href="V-ATPase">vacuolar type H+-ATPases</a>, the hydrolysis reaction is used to acidify cellular compartments, by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP.

ATP synthase is a massive protein complex with a mushroom-like shape. The mammalian enzyme complex contains 16 subunits and has a mass of approximately 600 <a href="kilodalton">kilodalton</a>s. The portion embedded within the membrane is called F and contains a ring of c subunits and the proton channel. The stalk and the ball-shaped headpiece is called F and is the site of ATP synthesis. The ball-shaped complex at the end of the F portion contains six proteins of two different kinds (three α subunits and three β subunits), whereas the "stalk" consists of one protein: the γ subunit, with the tip of the stalk extending into the ball of α and β subunits. Both the α and β subunits bind nucleotides, but only the β subunits catalyze the ATP synthesis reaction. Reaching along the side of the F portion and back into the membrane is a long rod-like subunit that anchors the α and β subunits into the base of the enzyme.

As protons cross the membrane through the channel in the base of ATP synthase, the F proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the <a href="ionization">ionization</a> of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing <a href="electrostatic">electrostatic</a> interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central <a href="axle">axle</a> (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a <a href="stator">stator</a>. This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.

This ATP synthesis reaction is called the "binding change mechanism" and involves the active site of a β subunit cycling between three states. In the "open" state, ADP and phosphate enter the active site (shown in brown in the diagram). The protein then closes up around the molecules and binds them loosely – the "loose" state (shown in red). The enzyme then changes shape again and forces these molecules together, with the active site in the resulting "tight" state (shown in pink) binding the newly produced ATP molecule with very high <a href="Dissociation%20constant">affinity</a>. Finally, the active site cycles back to the open state, releasing ATP and binding more ADP and phosphate, ready for the next cycle.

In some bacteria and archaea, ATP synthesis is driven by the movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane, rather than the movement of protons. Archaea such as "<a href="Methanococcus">Methanococcus</a>" also contain the AA synthase, a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible that, in some species, the AA form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but this might not be true in all cases.

Molecular oxygen is an ideal terminal <a href="electron%20acceptor">electron acceptor</a> because it is a strong oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates. Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is harmless, transfer of one or two electrons produces <a href="superoxide">superoxide</a> or <a href="peroxide">peroxide</a> anions, which are dangerously reactive.

These <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen species</a> and their reaction products, such as the <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> radical, are very harmful to cells, as they oxidize proteins and cause <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s in <a href="DNA">DNA</a>. This cellular damage might contribute to <a href="disease">disease</a> and is proposed as one cause of <a href="free-radical%20theory%20of%20aging">aging</a>.

The cytochrome c oxidase complex is highly efficient at reducing oxygen to water, and it releases very few partly reduced intermediates; however small amounts of superoxide anion and peroxide are produced by the electron transport chain. Particularly important is the reduction of <a href="coenzyme%20Q">coenzyme Q</a> in complex III, as a highly reactive ubisemiquinone free radical is formed as an intermediate in the Q cycle. This unstable species can lead to electron "leakage" when electrons transfer directly to oxygen, forming superoxide. As the production of reactive oxygen species by these proton-pumping complexes is greatest at high membrane potentials, it has been proposed that mitochondria regulate their activity to maintain the membrane potential within a narrow range that balances ATP production against oxidant generation. For instance, oxidants can activate <a href="uncoupling%20protein">uncoupling protein</a>s that reduce membrane potential.

To counteract these reactive oxygen species, cells contain numerous <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> systems, including antioxidant <a href="vitamin">vitamin</a>s such as <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a> and <a href="vitamin%20E">vitamin E</a>, and antioxidant enzymes such as <a href="superoxide%20dismutase">superoxide dismutase</a>, <a href="catalase">catalase</a>, and <a href="peroxidases">peroxidases</a>, which detoxify the reactive species, limiting damage to the cell.

There are several well-known <a href="drug">drug</a>s and <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Although any one of these toxins inhibits only one enzyme in the electron transport chain, inhibition of any step in this process will halt the rest of the process. For example, if <a href="oligomycin">oligomycin</a> inhibits ATP synthase, protons cannot pass back into the mitochondrion. As a result, the proton pumps are unable to operate, as the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use.

Not all inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation are toxins. In <a href="brown%20adipose%20tissue">brown adipose tissue</a>, regulated proton channels called <a href="uncoupling%20protein">uncoupling protein</a>s can uncouple respiration from ATP synthesis. This rapid respiration produces heat, and is particularly important as a way of maintaining <a href="body%20temperature">body temperature</a> for <a href="hibernation">hibernating</a> animals, although these proteins may also have a more general function in cells' responses to stress.

The field of oxidative phosphorylation began with the report in 1906 by <a href="Arthur%20Harden">Arthur Harden</a> of a vital role for phosphate in cellular <a href="fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">fermentation</a>, but initially only <a href="sugar%20phosphates">sugar phosphates</a> were known to be involved. However, in the early 1940s, the link between the oxidation of sugars and the generation of ATP was firmly established by <a href="Herman%20Kalckar">Herman Kalckar</a>, confirming the central role of ATP in energy transfer that had been proposed by <a href="Fritz%20Albert%20Lipmann">Fritz Albert Lipmann</a> in 1941. Later, in 1949, Morris Friedkin and <a href="Albert%20L.%20Lehninger">Albert L. Lehninger</a> proved that the coenzyme NADH linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle and the synthesis of ATP. The term "oxidative phosphorylation" was coined by in 1939.

For another twenty years, the mechanism by which ATP is generated remained mysterious, with scientists searching for an elusive "high-energy intermediate" that would link oxidation and phosphorylation reactions. This puzzle was solved by <a href="Peter%20D.%20Mitchell">Peter D. Mitchell</a> with the publication of the <a href="chemiosmotic%20theory">chemiosmotic theory</a> in 1961. At first, this proposal was highly controversial, but it was slowly accepted and Mitchell was awarded a <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel prize</a> in 1978. Subsequent research concentrated on purifying and characterizing the enzymes involved, with major contributions being made by <a href="David%20E.%20Green">David E. Green</a> on the complexes of the electron-transport chain, as well as <a href="Efraim%20Racker">Efraim Racker</a> on the ATP synthase. A critical step towards solving the mechanism of the ATP synthase was provided by <a href="Paul%20D.%20Boyer">Paul D. Boyer</a>, by his development in 1973 of the "binding change" mechanism, followed by his radical proposal of rotational catalysis in 1982. More recent work has included <a href="x-ray%20crystallography">structural studies</a> on the enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation by <a href="John%20E.%20Walker">John E. Walker</a>, with Walker and Boyer being awarded a Nobel Prize in 1997.

Octopus

The octopus is a soft-bodied, eight-<a href="cephalopod%20limb">limbed</a> <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a> of the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> Octopoda. Around 300 <a href="species">species</a> are recognised, and the order is grouped within the <a href="Class%20%28biology%29">class</a> <a href="Cephalopod">Cephalopod</a>a with <a href="squid">squid</a>s, <a href="cuttlefish">cuttlefish</a>, and <a href="nautiloid">nautiloid</a>s. Like other cephalopods, the octopus is <a href="symmetry%20in%20biology">bilaterally symmetric</a> with two eyes and a <a href="cephalopod%20beak">beak</a>, with its mouth at the center point of the eight limbs (traditionally called "arms", sometimes mistakenly called "<a href="tentacle">tentacle</a>s"). The soft body can rapidly alter its shape, enabling octopuses to squeeze through small gaps. They trail their eight appendages behind them as they swim. The <a href="Siphon%20%28mollusc%29">siphon</a> is used both for <a href="aquatic%20respiration">respiration</a> and for <a href="aquatic%20locomotion%23Jet%20propulsion">locomotion</a>, by expelling a jet of water. Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s.

Octopuses inhabit various regions of the <a href="ocean">ocean</a>, including <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s, <a href="pelagic">pelagic</a> waters, and the <a href="seabed">seabed</a>; some live in the <a href="intertidal%20zone">intertidal zone</a> and others at <a href="abyssal%20zone">abyssal depths</a>. Most species grow fast, mature early and are short-lived. During breeding, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes <a href="senescence">senescent</a> and dies. The female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies. Strategies to defend themselves against predators include the expulsion of <a href="octopus%20ink">ink</a>, the use of <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a> and <a href="deimatic%20display">threat displays</a>, their abilities to jet quickly through the water and hide, and even through deceit. All octopuses are <a href="venomous">venomous</a>, but only the <a href="blue-ringed%20octopus">blue-ringed octopus</a>es are known to be deadly to humans.

Octopuses appear in mythology as sea monsters like the <a href="Kraken">Kraken</a> of Norway and the <a href="Akkorokamui">Akkorokamui</a> of the <a href="Ainu%20people">Ainu</a>, and probably the <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a> of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>. A battle with an octopus appears in <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>'s book "<a href="Toilers%20of%20the%20Sea">Toilers of the Sea</a>", inspiring other works such as <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>'s "<a href="Octopussy%20and%20The%20Living%20Daylights">Octopussy</a>". Octopuses appear in Japanese erotic art, "<a href="shunga">shunga</a>". They are eaten and considered a delicacy by humans in many parts of the world, especially the <a href="Mediterranean%20cuisine">Mediterranean</a> and the Asian seas.

The <a href="New%20Latin">scientific Latin</a> term <a href="wikt%3Aoctopus%23Latin">"octopus"</a> was derived from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> <a href="wikt%3A%E1%BD%80%CE%BA%CF%84%CF%8E%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%82%23Ancient%20Greek">ὀκτώπους</a>, a <a href="compound%20%28linguistics%29">compound</a> form of <a href="wikt%3A%E1%BD%80%CE%BA%CF%84%CF%8E%23Ancient%20Greek">ὀκτώ</a> ("oktō", "eight") and <a href="wikt%3A%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%82%23Ancient%20Greek">πούς</a> ("pous", "foot"), itself a variant form of <a href="wikt%3A%E1%BD%80%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%AC%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%82">ὀκτάπους</a>, a word used for example by <a href="Alexander%20of%20Tralles">Alexander of Tralles</a> (c. 525–605) for the common octopus. The standard <a href="plural">plural</a>ised form of "octopus" in English is "octopuses"; the Ancient Greek plural ὀκτώποδες, "octopodes" (), has also been used historically. The alternative plural "octopi" – which <a href="hypercorrection">wrongly assumes</a> it is a <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> <a href="second%20declension">second declension</a> "<a href="wikt%3A-us%23Latin">-us</a>" noun or adjective when, in either Greek or Latin, it is a <a href="third%20declension">third declension</a> one – is considered grammatically incorrect, but is used frequently enough to be acknowledged by the <a href="descriptivist">descriptivist</a> "Merriam-Webster 11th Collegiate Dictionary" and "Webster's New World College Dictionary". The "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" lists "octopuses", "octopi", and "octopodes", in that order, reflecting frequency of use, calling "octopodes" rare and noting that "octopi" is based on a misunderstanding. The "<a href="New%20Oxford%20American%20Dictionary">New Oxford American Dictionary</a>" (3rd Edition, 2010) lists "octopuses" as the only acceptable pluralisation, and indicates that "octopodes" is still occasionally used, but that "octopi" is incorrect.

The <a href="Enteroctopus%20dofleini">giant Pacific octopus</a> "(Enteroctopus dofleini)" is often cited as the largest known octopus species. Adults usually weigh around 15 kg (33 lb), with an arm span of up to 4.3 m (14 ft). The largest specimen of this species to be scientifically documented was an animal with a live mass of 71 kg (156.5 lb). Much larger sizes have been claimed for the giant Pacific octopus: one specimen was recorded as 272 kg (600 lb) with an arm span of 9 m (30 ft).
A carcass of the <a href="seven-arm%20octopus">seven-arm octopus</a>, "Haliphron atlanticus", weighed 61 kg (134 lb) and was estimated to have had a live mass of 75 kg (165 lb). The smallest species is "<a href="Octopus%20wolfi">Octopus wolfi</a>", which is around and weighs less than .

The octopus is <a href="Symmetry%20in%20biology">bilaterally symmetrical</a> along its dorso-ventral axis; the head and <a href="Foot%20%28mollusc%29">foot</a> are at one end of an elongated body and function as the anterior (front) of the animal. The head includes the mouth and brain. The foot has evolved into a set of flexible, prehensile <a href="cephalopod%20limb">appendages</a>, known as "arms", that surround the mouth and are attached to each other near their base by a webbed structure. The arms can be described based on side and sequence position (such as L1, R1, L2, R2) and divided into four pairs. The two rear appendages are generally used to walk on the sea floor, while the other six are used to forage for food; hence some biologists refer to the animals has having six "arms" and two "legs". The bulbous and hollow <a href="Mantle%20%28mollusc%29">mantle</a> is fused to the back of the head and is known as the visceral hump; it contains most of the vital organs. The mantle cavity has muscular walls and contains the gills; it is connected to the exterior by a funnel or <a href="Siphon%20%28mollusc%29">siphon</a>. The mouth of an octopus, located underneath the arms, has a sharp hard <a href="Cephalopod%20beak">beak</a>.

The skin consists of a thin outer epidermis with mucous cells and sensory cells, and a connective tissue dermis consisting largely of collagen fibres and various cells allowing colour change. Most of the body is made of soft tissue allowing it to lengthen, contract, and contort itself. The octopus can squeeze through tiny gaps; even the larger species can pass through an opening close to in diameter. Lacking skeletal support, the arms work as <a href="muscular%20hydrostat">muscular hydrostat</a>s and contain longitudinal, transverse and circular muscles around a central axial nerve. They can extend and contract, twist to left or right, bend at any place in any direction or be held rigid.

The interior surfaces of the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an <a href="acetabulum%20%28morphology%29">acetabulum</a>, both of which are thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker attaches to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.
The eyes of the octopus are large and are at the top of the head. They are similar in structure to those of a fish and are enclosed in a <a href="cartilage">cartilaginous</a> capsule fused to the cranium. The <a href="cornea">cornea</a> is formed from a <a href="translucent">translucent</a> epidermal layer and the slit-shaped <a href="pupil">pupil</a> forms a hole in the <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> and lies just behind. The lens is suspended behind the pupil and photoreceptive <a href="Retina">retinal cells</a> cover the back of the eye. The pupil can be adjusted in size and a retinal pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.

Some species differ in form from the typical octopus body shape. Members of the suborder <a href="Cirrina">Cirrina</a> have stout gelatinous bodies with webbing that reaches near the tip of their arms, and two large <a href="Cephalopod%20fin">fins</a> above the eyes, supported by an <a href="cirrate%20shell">internal shell</a>. Fleshy papillae or <a href="cirrus%20%28biology%29">cirri</a> are found along the bottom of the arms, and the eyes are more developed.

Octopuses have a closed <a href="circulatory%20system">circulatory system</a>, in which the blood remains inside blood vessels. Octopuses have three hearts; a systemic heart that circulates blood round the body and two branchial hearts that pump it through each of the two gills. The systemic heart is inactive when the animal is swimming and thus it tires quickly and prefers to crawl.
Octopus blood contains the <a href="copper">copper</a>-rich protein <a href="haemocyanin">haemocyanin</a> to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very <a href="viscosity">viscous</a> and it requires considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a>s can exceed 75 mmHg. In cold conditions with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.

The systemic heart has muscular contractile walls and consists of a single ventricle and two atria, one for each side of the body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular <a href="endothelium">endothelium</a> which is quite unlike that of most other <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.

Respiration involves drawing water into the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles and allow them to expand the respiratory chamber. The <a href="lamella%20%28surface%20anatomy%29">lamella</a> structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at . Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.

The thin skin of the octopus absorbs additional oxygen. When resting, around 41% of an octopus's oxygen absorption is through the skin. This decreases to 33% when it swims, as more water flows over the gills; skin oxygen uptake also increases. When it is resting after a meal, absorption through the skin can drop to 3% of its total oxygen uptake.

The digestive system of the octopus begins with the <a href="buccal%20mass">buccal mass</a> which consists of the mouth with its <a href="chitin">chitin</a>ous beak, the pharynx, <a href="radula">radula</a> and salivary glands. The radula is a spiked, muscular tongue-like organ with multiple rows of tiny teeth. Food is broken down and is forced into the oesophagus by two lateral extensions of the esophageal side walls in addition to the radula. From there it is transferred to the <a href="gastrointestinal%20tract">gastrointestinal tract</a>, which is mostly suspended from the roof of the mantle cavity by numerous membranes. The tract consists of a <a href="crop%20%28anatomy%29">crop</a>, where the food is stored; a stomach, where food is ground down; a <a href="caecum">caecum</a> where the now sludgy food is sorted into fluids and particles and which plays an important role in absorption; the <a href="hepatopancreas">digestive gland</a>, where liver cells break down and absorb the fluid and become "brown bodies"; and the intestine, where the accumulated waste is turned into faecal ropes by secretions and blown out of the funnel via the rectum.

During <a href="osmoregulation">osmoregulation</a>, fluid is added to the <a href="Pericardium">pericardia</a> of the branchial hearts. The octopus has two <a href="nephridium">nephridia</a> (equivalent to vertebrate kidneys) which are associated with the branchial hearts; these and their associated ducts connect the pericardial cavities with the mantle cavity. Before reaching the branchial heart, each branch of the <a href="vena%20cava">vena cava</a> expands to form renal appendages which are in direct contact with the thin-walled nephridium. The urine is first formed in the pericardial cavity, and is modified by excretion, chiefly of ammonia, and selective absorption from the renal appendages, as it is passed along the associated duct and through the nephridiopore into the mantle cavity.

The octopus (along with cuttlefish) has the highest <a href="brain-to-body%20mass%20ratio">brain-to-body mass ratio</a>s of all invertebrates; it is also greater than that of many vertebrates. It has a highly complex <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a>, only part of which is localised in its brain, which is contained in a cartilaginous capsule. Two-thirds of an octopus's <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s are found in the nerve cords of its arms, which show a variety of complex <a href="reflex">reflex</a> actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain. Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organised in their brain via an internal <a href="somatotopic%20arrangement">somatotopic map</a> of its body, instead using a nonsomatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates.

Like other cephalopods, octopuses can distinguish the <a href="polarization%20%28waves%29">polarisation</a> of light. <a href="Colour%20vision">Colour vision</a> appears to vary from species to species, for example being present in "O. aegina" but absent in "O. vulgaris". Researchers believe that <a href="opsin">opsin</a>s in the skin can sense different wavelengths of light and help the creatures choose a coloration that camouflages them, in addition to light input from the eyes. Other researchers hypothesise that <a href="cephalopod%20eye">cephalopod eye</a>s in species which only have a single <a href="photoreceptor%20protein">photoreceptor protein</a> may use <a href="chromatic%20aberration">chromatic aberration</a> to turn monochromatic vision into colour vision, though this sacrifices image quality. This would explain pupils shaped like the letter U, the letter W, or a <a href="dumbbell">dumbbell</a>, as well as explaining the need for colourful mating displays.

Attached to the brain are two special organs called <a href="statocyst">statocyst</a>s (sac-like structures containing a mineralised mass and sensitive hairs), that allow the octopus to sense the orientation of its body. They provide information on the position of the body relative to gravity and can detect angular acceleration. An <a href="autonomic%20nervous%20system">autonomic</a> response keeps the octopus's eyes oriented so that the pupil is always horizontal. Octopuses may also use the statocyst to hear sound. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400 Hz and 1000 Hz, and hears best at 600 Hz.

Octopuses also have an excellent <a href="somatosensory%20system">sense of touch</a>. The octopus's suction cups are equipped with <a href="chemoreceptors">chemoreceptors</a> so the octopus can <a href="taste">taste</a> what it touches. Octopus arms do not become tangled or stuck to each other because the sensors recognise octopus skin and prevent self-attachment.

The arms contain <a href="tension%20%28mechanics%29">tension</a> sensors so the octopus knows whether its arms are stretched out, but this is not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess <a href="stereognosis">stereognosis</a>; that is, it does not form a <a href="mental%20image">mental image</a> of the overall shape of the object it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor <a href="proprioception">proprioceptive</a> sense, and it knows what exact motions were made only by <a href="exteroception">observing the arms visually</a>.

The <a href="ink%20sac">ink sac</a> of an octopus is located under the digestive gland. A gland attached to the sac produces the <a href="octopus%20ink">ink</a>, and the sac stores it. The sac is close enough to the funnel for the octopus to shoot out the ink with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the ink passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the ink is <a href="melanin">melanin</a>, which gives it its black colour. <a href="Cirrate">Cirrate</a> octopuses lack the ink sac.

Octopuses are <a href="Gonochorism">gonochoric</a> and have a single, posteriorly-located gonad which is associated with the <a href="coelom">coelom</a>. The <a href="testis">testis</a> in males and the <a href="ovary">ovary</a> in females bulges into the <a href="gonocoel">gonocoel</a> and the <a href="gamete">gamete</a>s are released here. The gonocoel is connected by the <a href="gonoduct">gonoduct</a> to the <a href="mantle%20cavity">mantle cavity</a>, which it enters at the <a href="gonopore">gonopore</a>. An optic gland creates hormones that cause the octopus to mature and age and stimulate gamete production. The gland may be triggered by environmental conditions such as temperature, light and nutrition, which thus control the timing of reproduction and lifespan.

When octopuses reproduce, the male uses a specialised arm called a <a href="hectocotylus">hectocotylus</a> to transfer <a href="spermatophore">spermatophore</a>s (packets of sperm) from the terminal organ of the reproductive tract (the cephalopod "penis") into the female's mantle cavity. The hectocotylus in <a href="benthic">benthic</a> octopuses is usually the third right arm, which has a spoon-shaped depression and modified suckers near the tip. In most species, fertilisation occurs in the mantle cavity.

The reproduction of octopuses has been studied in only a few species. One such species is the <a href="giant%20Pacific%20octopus">giant Pacific octopus</a>, in which courtship is accompanied, especially in the male, by changes in skin texture and colour. The male may cling to the top or side of the female or position himself beside her. There is some speculation that he may first use his hectocotylus to remove any spermatophore or sperm already present in the female. He picks up a spermatophore from his spermatophoric sac with the hectocotylus, inserts it into the female's mantle cavity, and deposits it in the correct location for the species, which in the giant Pacific octopus is the opening of the oviduct. Two spermatophores are transferred in this way; these are about one metre (yard) long, and the empty ends may protrude from the female's mantle. A complex hydraulic mechanism releases the sperm from the spermatophore, and it is stored internally by the female.

About forty days after mating, the female giant Pacific octopus attaches strings of small fertilised eggs (10,000 to 70,000 in total) to rocks in a crevice or under an overhang. Here she guards and cares for them for about five months (160 days) until they hatch. In colder waters, such as those off of <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, it may take as much as 10 months for the eggs to completely develop. The female aerates the eggs and keeps them clean; if left untended, many eggs will not hatch. She does not feed during this time and dies soon afterwards. Males become <a href="senescence">senescent</a> and die a few weeks after mating.

The eggs have large yolks; <a href="cleavage%20%28embryo%29">cleavage</a> (division) is superficial and a <a href="germinal%20disc">germinal disc</a> develops at the pole. During <a href="gastrulation">gastrulation</a>, the margins of this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop as part of the foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.

Most young octopuses hatch as <a href="paralarva">paralarva</a>e and are <a href="plankton">plankton</a>ic for weeks to months, depending on the species and water temperature. They feed on <a href="copepod">copepod</a>s, <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a> larvae and other <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a>, eventually settling on the ocean floor and developing directly into adults with no distinct <a href="Metamorphosis">metamorphoses</a> that are present in other groups of <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a> larvae. Octopus species that produce larger eggs – including the <a href="Southern%20blue-ringed%20octopus">southern blue-ringed</a>, <a href="Caribbean%20reef%20octopus">Caribbean reef</a>, <a href="California%20two-spot%20octopus">California two-spot</a>, "<a href="Eledone%20moschata">Eledone moschata</a>" and deep sea octopuses – do not have a paralarval stage, but hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults.

In the <a href="Argonaut%20%28animal%29">argonaut</a> (paper nautilus), the female secretes a fine, fluted, papery shell in which the eggs are deposited and in which she also resides while floating in mid-ocean. In this she broods the young, and it also serves as a buoyancy aid allowing her to adjust her depth. The male argonaut is minute by comparison and has no shell.

Octopuses have a relatively short <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a>; some species live for as little as six months. The <a href="giant%20Pacific%20octopus">giant Pacific octopus</a>, one of the two largest species of octopus, may live for as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the <a href="hormonal">hormonal</a> influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of <a href="broodiness">broodiness</a>, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.

Octopuses live in every ocean, and different species have adapted to different <a href="marine%20habitat">marine habitat</a>s. As juveniles, common octopuses inhabit shallow <a href="tide%20pool">tide pool</a>s. The Hawaiian day octopus ("<a href="Octopus%20cyanea">Octopus cyanea</a>") lives on coral reefs; <a href="Argonaut%20%28animal%29">argonauts</a> drift in <a href="Pelagic%20zone">pelagic waters</a>. "<a href="Abdopus%20aculeatus">Abdopus aculeatus</a>" mostly lives in near-shore <a href="seagrass">seagrass</a> beds. Some species are adapted to the cold, ocean depths. The spoon-armed octopus ("<a href="Bathypolypus%20arcticus">Bathypolypus arcticus</a>") is found in <a href="abyssal%20plain">abyssal plain</a>s at depths of , and "<a href="Vulcanoctopus%20hydrothermalis">Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis</a>" lives near <a href="hydrothermal%20vent">hydrothermal vent</a>s at . The cirrate species are often free-swimming and live in deep-water habitats. No species are known to live in fresh water.

Most species are solitary when not mating, though a few are known to occur in high densities and with frequent interactions, signaling, mate defending and eviction of individuals from dens. This is likely the result of abundant food supplies combined with limited den sites. Octopuses hide in dens, which are typically crevices in rocky outcrops or other hard structures, though some species burrow into sand or mud. Octopuses are not <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> but generally remain in a home range; they may leave the area in search of food. They can use navigation skills to return to a den without having to retrace their outward route. They are not known to be migratory.

Octopuses bring captured prey back to the den where they can eat it safely. Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and the den is often surrounded by a <a href="midden">midden</a> of dead and uneaten food items. Other creatures, such as fish, <a href="crab">crab</a>s, molluscs and <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a>s, often share the den with the octopus, either because they have arrived as <a href="scavenger">scavenger</a>s, or because they have survived capture.

Nearly all octopuses are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="polychaete%20worm">polychaete worm</a>s, and other molluscs such as <a href="whelk">whelk</a>s and <a href="clam">clam</a>s; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, fish and other cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include <a href="Bivalvia">bivalve molluscs</a> such as the cockle "<a href="Clinocardium%20nuttallii">Clinocardium nuttallii</a>", clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and <a href="Majoidea">spider crabs</a>. Prey that it is likely to reject include <a href="Naticidae">moon snails</a>, because they are too large, and <a href="limpet">limpet</a>s, <a href="Crassadoma">rock scallops</a>, <a href="chiton">chiton</a>s and <a href="abalone">abalone</a>, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.

A benthic (bottom-dwelling) octopus typically moves among the rocks and feels through the crevices. The creature may make a jet-propelled pounce on prey and pull it towards the mouth with its arms, the suckers restraining it. Small prey may be completely trapped by the webbed structure. Octopuses usually inject crustaceans like crabs with a paralysing <a href="saliva">saliva</a> then dismember them with their beaks. Octopuses feed on shelled molluscs either by forcing the valves apart, or by drilling a hole in the shell to inject a <a href="neurotoxin">nerve toxin</a>. It used to be thought that the hole was drilled by the radula, but it has now been shown that minute teeth at the tip of the salivary papilla are involved, and an enzyme in the toxic saliva is used to dissolve the calcium carbonate of the shell. It takes about three hours for "O. vulgaris" to create a hole. Once the shell is penetrated, the prey dies almost instantaneously, its muscles relax, and the soft tissues are easy for the octopus to remove. Crabs may also be treated in this way; tough-shelled species are more likely to be drilled, and soft-shelled crabs are torn apart.

Some species have other modes of feeding. "<a href="Grimpoteuthis">Grimpoteuthis</a>" has a reduced or non-existent radula and swallows prey whole. In the deep-sea genus "<a href="Stauroteuthis">Stauroteuthis</a>", some of the muscle cells that control the suckers in most species have been replaced with <a href="photophore">photophore</a>s which are believed to fool prey by directing them towards the mouth, making them one of the few <a href="bioluminescent">bioluminescent</a> octopuses.

Octopuses mainly move about by relatively slow crawling, with some swimming in a head-first position. <a href="Jet%20propulsion">Jet propulsion</a>, or backwards swimming, is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and crawling. When in no hurry, they usually crawl on either solid or soft surfaces. Several arms are extended forwards, some of the suckers adhere to the substrate and the animal hauls itself forwards with its powerful arm muscles, while other arms may push rather than pull. As progress is made, other arms move ahead to repeat these actions and the original suckers detach. During crawling, the heart rate nearly doubles, and the animal requires ten or fifteen minutes to recover from relatively minor exercise.

Most octopuses swim by expelling a jet of water from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a <a href="Spindle%20%28textiles%29">fusiform</a> appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.

Cirrate octopuses cannot produce jet propulsion and rely on their fins for swimming. They have neutral buoyancy and drift through the water with the fins extended. They can also contract their arms and surrounding web to make sudden moves known as "take-offs". Another form of locomotion is "pumping", which involves symmetrical contractions of muscles in their webs producing <a href="peristalsis">peristaltic waves</a>. This moves the body slowly.

In 2005, "<a href="Abdopus">Adopus aculeatus</a>" and veined octopus ("<a href="Amphioctopus%20marginatus">Amphioctopus marginatus</a>") were found to walk on two arms, while at the same time mimicking plant matter. This form of locomotion allows these octopuses to move quickly away from a potential predator without being recognised. A study of this behaviour led to the suggestion that the two rearmost appendages may be more accurately termed "legs" rather than "arms". Some species of octopus can crawl out of the water briefly, which they may do between tide pools while hunting crustaceans or gastropods or to escape predators. "Stilt walking" is used by the veined octopus when carrying stacked coconut shells. The octopus carries the shells underneath it with two arms, and progresses with an ungainly gait supported by its remaining arms held rigid.

Octopuses are highly <a href="intelligence">intelligent</a>; the extent of their intelligence and learning capability are not well defined. <a href="Maze">Maze</a> and <a href="problem%20solving">problem-solving</a> experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both <a href="short-term%20memory">short-</a> and <a href="long-term%20memory">long-term memory</a>. It is not known precisely what contribution learning makes to adult octopus behaviour. Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, as adults provide no <a href="parental%20care">parental care</a> beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.

In laboratory experiments, octopuses can be readily trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They have been reported to practise <a href="observational%20learning">observational learning</a>, although the validity of these findings is contested. Octopuses have also been observed in what has been described as <a href="play%20%28animal%20behaviour%29">play</a>: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them. Octopuses often break out of their aquariums and sometimes into others in search of food. They have even boarded <a href="fishing%20boat">fishing boat</a>s and opened holds to eat crabs. The <a href="veined%20octopus">veined octopus</a> collects discarded <a href="coconut">coconut</a> shells, then uses them to build a shelter, an example of <a href="tool%20use%20by%20animals">tool use</a>.

Octopuses use <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a> when hunting, and to avoid predators. To do this they use specialised skin cells which change the appearance of the skin by adjusting its colour, opacity, or reflectivity. <a href="Chromatophore">Chromatophore</a>s contain yellow, orange, red, brown, or black pigments; most species have three of these colours, while some have two or four. Other colour-changing cells are reflective iridophores and white leucophores. This colour-changing ability is also used to communicate with or warn other octopuses.

Octopuses can create distracting patterns with waves of dark coloration across the body, a display known as the "passing cloud". Muscles in the skin change the texture of the mantle to achieve greater camouflage. In some species, the mantle can take on the spiky appearance of algae; in others, skin anatomy is limited to relatively uniform shades of one colour with limited skin texture. Octopuses that are diurnal and live in shallow water have evolved more complex skin than their nocturnal and deep-sea counterparts.

A "moving rock" trick involves the octopus mimicking a rock and them inching across the open space in a speed matching the movement of in the surrounding water, allowing it to move in plain sight of a predator.

Aside from humans, octopuses may be preyed on by fishes, <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s, <a href="sea%20otter">sea otter</a>s, <a href="pinniped">pinniped</a>s, <a href="cetacea">cetacea</a>ns, and other cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and <a href="mimicry">mimicry</a>; some have conspicuous <a href="aposematism">warning coloration (aposematism)</a> or <a href="deimatic%20behaviour%26lt%3B%21--British%20English--%26gt%3B">deimatic behaviour</a>. An octopus may spend 40% of its time hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of "Enteroctopus dofleini" in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings of the highly venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The <a href="Atlantic%20white-spotted%20octopus">Atlantic white-spotted octopus</a> ("Callistoctopus macropus") turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web to make it look as big and threatening as possible.

Once they have been seen by a predator, they commonly try to escape but can also use distraction with an ink cloud ejected from the ink sac. The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ <a href="olfaction">smell</a> for hunting, such as <a href="shark">shark</a>s. Ink clouds of some species might act as <a href="Pseudomorph%23Pseudomorph%20in%20other%20fields">pseudomorphs</a>, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.

When under attack, some octopuses can perform arm <a href="autotomy">autotomy</a>, in a manner similar to the way <a href="skink">skink</a>s and other <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s detach their tails. The crawling arm may distract would-be predators. Such severed arms remain sensitive to stimuli and move away from unpleasant sensations. Octopuses can <a href="limb%20regeneration">replace lost limbs</a>.

Some octopuses, such as the <a href="mimic%20octopus">mimic octopus</a>, can combine their highly flexible bodies with their colour-changing ability to mimic other, more dangerous animals, such as <a href="Pterois">lionfish</a>, sea snakes, and <a href="eel">eel</a>s.

The diseases and parasites that affect octopuses have been little studied, but cephalopods are known to be the intermediate or final <a href="host%20%28biology%29">hosts</a> of various parasitic <a href="Cestoda">cestodes</a>, <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s and copepods; 150 species of <a href="protist">protist</a>an and <a href="metazoa">metazoa</a>n parasites have been recognised. The <a href="Dicyemidae">Dicyemidae</a> are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are <a href="endosymbiont">endosymbiont</a>s. <a href="Coccidia">Coccidia</a>ns in the genus "<a href="Aggregata">Aggregata</a>" living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an innate <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>, and the <a href="hemocyte%20%28invertebrate%20immune%20system%20cell%29">haemocytes</a> respond to infection by <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a>, encapsulation, infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens. The haemocytes play an important role in the recognition and elimination of foreign bodies and wound repair. Captive animals have been found to be more susceptible to pathogens than wild ones. A gram-negative bacterium, "<a href="Vibrio%20lentus">Vibrio lentus</a>", has been found to cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and death of octopuses in extreme cases.

Cephalopods have existed for 500 million years and octopus ancestors were in the <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> seas 300 million years ago. The oldest known octopus fossil is "<a href="Pohlsepia">Pohlsepia</a>", which lived 296 million years ago. Researchers have identified impressions of eight arms, two eyes, and possibly an ink sac. Octopuses are mostly soft tissue, and so fossils are relatively rare. Octopuses, <a href="squid">squid</a>s and <a href="cuttlefish">cuttlefish</a> belong to the clade <a href="Coleoidea">Coleoidea</a>. They are known as "soft-bodied" cephalopods, lacking the external shell of most molluscs and other cephalopods like the <a href="nautiloids">nautiloids</a> and the extinct <a href="Ammonoidea">Ammonoidea</a>. Octopuses have eight limbs like other coleoids but lack the extra specialised feeding appendages known as <a href="tentacle">tentacle</a>s which are longer and thinner with suckers only at their club-like ends. The vampire squid ("<a href="Vampyroteuthis">Vampyroteuthis</a>") also lacks tentacles but has sensory filaments.

Two possible extant cephalopod phylogenies, based on genetics studies by Strugnell "et al." 2007, are shown in the possible <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a>s.

The scientific name Octopoda was first coined and given as the order of octopuses in 1818 by English biologist <a href="William%20Elford%20Leach">William Elford Leach</a>, who classified them as Octopoida the previous year. The Octopoda consists of around 300 known species and can be divided into two suborders, the <a href="Incirrina">Incirrina</a> and the Cirrina. The incirrate octopuses (the majority of species) lack the cirri and paired swimming fins of the cirrates. In addition, the internal shell of incirrates is either present as a pair of <a href="Stylet%20%28anatomy%29">stylets</a> or absent altogether.

Octopuses and other coleoid cephalopods are capable of greater <a href="RNA%20editing">RNA editing</a> (which involves changes to the <a href="nucleic%20acid%20sequence">nucleic acid sequence</a> of the <a href="primary%20transcript">primary transcript</a> of RNA molecules) than any other organisms. Editing is concentrated in the nervous system and affects proteins involved in neural excitability and neuronal morphology. More than 60% of RNA transcripts for coleoid brains are recoded by editing, compared to less than 1% for a human or <a href="Drosophila">fruit fly</a>. Coleoids rely mostly on <a href="ADAR">ADAR</a> enzymes for RNA editing, which requires large <a href="double-stranded%20RNA">double-stranded RNA</a> structures to flank the editing sites. Both the structures and editing sites are conserved in the coleoid genome and the mutation rates for the sites are severely hampered. Hence, greater transcriptome plasticity has come as the cost of slower genome evolution. High levels of RNA editing do not appear to be present in more <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> cephalopods or other molluscs.

Ancient seafaring people were aware of the octopus, as evidenced by certain artworks and designs. For example, a stone carving found in the archaeological recovery from Bronze Age <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan Crete</a> at <a href="Knossos">Knossos</a> (1900–1100 BC) has a depiction of a fisherman carrying an octopus. The terrifyingly powerful <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a> of <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> has been thought to have been inspired by the octopus or squid, the octopus itself representing the severed head of <a href="Medusa">Medusa</a>, the beak as the protruding tongue and fangs, and its tentacles as the snakes. The <a href="Kraken">Kraken</a> are legendary sea monsters of giant proportions said to dwell off the coasts of Norway and Greenland, usually portrayed in art as a giant octopus attacking ships. <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> included it in the first edition of his 1735 "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>". A Hawaiian <a href="creation%20myth">creation myth</a> says that the present cosmos is the last of a series which arose in stages from the ruins of the previous universe. In this account, the octopus is the lone survivor of the previous, alien universe. The <a href="Akkorokamui">Akkorokamui</a> is a gigantic octopus-like <a href="monster">monster</a> from <a href="Ainu%20people">Ainu</a> folklore.
A battle with an octopus plays a significant role in <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>'s book "Travailleurs de la mer" ("<a href="Toilers%20of%20the%20Sea">Toilers of the Sea</a>"), relating to his time in exile on <a href="Guernsey">Guernsey</a>.
<a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>'s 1966 short story collection "<a href="Octopussy%20and%20The%20Living%20Daylights">Octopussy and The Living Daylights</a>", and the 1983 <a href="Octopussy">"James Bond" film</a> were partly inspired by Hugo's book.

Japanese erotic art, "<a href="shunga">shunga</a>", includes <a href="ukiyo-e">ukiyo-e</a> woodblock prints such as <a href="Katsushika%20Hokusai">Katsushika Hokusai</a>'s 1814 print "Tako to ama" (<a href="The%20Dream%20of%20the%20Fisherman%27s%20Wife">The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife</a>), in which an <a href="ama%20diver">ama diver</a> is sexually intertwined with a large and a small octopus. The print is a forerunner of <a href="tentacle%20erotica">tentacle erotica</a>. The biologist <a href="P.%20Z.%20Myers">P. Z. Myers</a> noted in his science blog, <a href="Pharyngula%20%28blog%29">Pharyngula</a>, that octopuses appear in "extraordinary" graphic illustrations involving women, tentacles, and bare breasts.

Since it has numerous arms emanating from a common centre, the octopus is often used as a symbol for a powerful and manipulative organisation, usually negatively.

Octopuses generally avoid humans, but <a href="cephalopod%20attack">incidents have been verified</a>. For example, a Pacific octopus, said to be nearly perfectly camouflaged, "lunged" at a diver and "wrangled" over his camera before it let go. Another diver recorded the encounter on video. 

All species are venomous, but only blue-ringed octopuses have venom that is lethal to humans. Bites are reported each year across the animals' range from Australia to the eastern Indo-Pacific Ocean. They bite only when provoked or accidentally stepped upon; bites are small and usually painless. The venom appears to be able to penetrate the skin without a puncture, given prolonged contact. It contains <a href="tetrodotoxin">tetrodotoxin</a>, which causes paralysis by blocking the transmission of <a href="nerve%20impulse">nerve impulse</a>s to the muscles. This causes death by respiratory failure leading to <a href="Cerebral%20hypoxia">cerebral anoxia</a>. No antidote is known, but if breathing can be kept going artificially, patients recover within 24 hours. Bites have been recorded from captive octopuses of other species; they leave swellings which disappear in a day or two.

Octopus <a href="fisheries">fisheries</a> exist around the world with total catches varying between 245,320 and 322,999 metric tons from 1986 to 1995. The world catch peaked in 2007 at 380,000 tons, and fell by a tenth by 2012. Methods to capture octopuses include pots, <a href="fish%20trap">traps</a>, <a href="trawling">trawls</a>, snares, drift fishing, spearing, hooking and hand collection. Octopus is eaten in many cultures and is a common food on the Mediterranean and Asian coasts. The arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways, often varying by species or geography. Live octopuses are eaten in several countries around the world, including the US. Animal welfare groups have objected to this practice on the basis that octopuses can experience pain. Octopuses have a food conversion efficiency greater than that of chickens, making <a href="octopus%20aquaculture">octopus aquaculture</a> a possibility.

In classical Greece, <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> (384–322 BC) <a href="Aristotle%27s%20biology">commented on</a> the colour-changing abilities of the octopus, both for camouflage and for <a href="signalling%20theory">signalling</a>, in his "<a href="Historia%20animalium">Historia animalium</a>": "The octopus ... seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it; it does so also <a href="deimatic%20behaviour">when alarmed</a>." Aristotle noted that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm and suggested it might be used in sexual reproduction. This claim was widely disbelieved until the 19th century. It was described in 1829 by the French zoologist <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a>, who supposed it to be a parasitic worm, naming it as a new species, "Hectocotylus octopodis". Other zoologists thought it a spermatophore; the German zoologist <a href="Heinrich%20M%C3%BCller%20%28physiologist%29">Heinrich Müller</a> believed it was "designed" to detach during copulation. In 1856 the Danish zoologist <a href="Japetus%20Steenstrup">Japetus Steenstrup</a> demonstrated that it is used to transfer sperm, and only rarely detaches.

Octopuses offer many <a href="model%20organism">possibilities in biological research</a>, including their ability to regenerate limbs, change the colour of their skin, behave intelligently with a distributed nervous system, and make use of 168 kinds of <a href="protocadherin">protocadherin</a>s (humans have 58), the proteins that guide the connections neurons make with each other. The California two-spot octopus has had its genome sequenced, allowing exploration of its molecular adaptations. Having <a href="convergent%20evolution">independently evolved</a> mammal-like intelligence, octopuses have been compared to hypothetical <a href="Extraterrestrial%20intelligence">intelligent extraterrestrials</a>. Their problem-solving skills, along with their mobility and lack of rigid structure enable them to escape from supposedly secure tanks in laboratories and <a href="public%20aquarium">public aquarium</a>s.

Due to their intelligence, octopuses are listed in some countries as <a href="animal%20testing">experimental animals</a> on which surgery may not be performed without <a href="anesthesia">anesthesia</a>, a protection usually extended only to vertebrates. In the UK from 1993 to 2012, the common octopus ("Octopus vulgaris") was the only invertebrate protected under the <a href="Animals%20%28Scientific%20Procedures%29%20Act%201986">Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986</a>. In 2012, this legislation was extended to include all cephalopods in accordance with a general <a href="European%20Union">EU</a> directive.

Some <a href="robotics">robotics</a> research is exploring <a href="biomimicry">biomimicry</a> of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 a team in Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft <a href="pneumatic">pneumatic</a>ally controlled <a href="silicone">silicone</a> gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.

Nicknamed "The Wizard" for his defensive brilliance, Smith set major league records for career <a href="assist%20%28baseball%29">assists</a> (8,375) and <a href="double%20play">double play</a>s (1,590) by a shortstop (the latter since broken by <a href="Omar%20Vizquel">Omar Vizquel</a>), as well as the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL) record with 2,511 career games at the position; Smith won the NL <a href="Gold%20Glove%20Award">Gold Glove Award</a> for play at shortstop for 13 consecutive seasons (1980–92). A 15-time <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a>, he accumulated 2,460 <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a> and 580 <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a>s during his career, and won the NL <a href="Silver%20Slugger%20Award">Silver Slugger Award</a> as the best-hitting shortstop in 1987. He was elected to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in his first year of eligibility in 2002. He was also elected to the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Museum">St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame</a> in the inaugural class of 2014.

Smith was born in <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>, but his family moved to <a href="Watts%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Watts, Los Angeles</a>, when he was six years old. While participating in childhood athletic activities, Smith developed quick reflexes; he went on to play baseball in high school and college, at Los Angeles' <a href="Locke%20High%20School">Locke High School</a> and <a href="California%20Polytechnic%20State%20University%2C%20San%20Luis%20Obispo">Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo</a> respectively. Drafted as an amateur player by the Padres, Smith made his major league debut in 1978. He quickly established himself as an outstanding fielder, and later became known for performing backflips on special occasions while taking his position at the beginning of a game. Smith won his first Gold Glove Award in 1980, and made his first All-Star Game appearance in 1981. When conflict with Padres' ownership developed, he was traded to the Cardinals for shortstop <a href="Garry%20Templeton">Garry Templeton</a> in 1982.

Upon joining the Cardinals, Smith helped the <a href="1982%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">team</a> win the <a href="1982%20World%20Series">1982 World Series</a>. Three years later, his game-winning <a href="home%20run">home run</a> during Game 5 of the <a href="1985%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">1985 National League Championship Series</a> prompted broadcaster <a href="Jack%20Buck">Jack Buck</a>'s "Go crazy, folks!" play-by-play call. Despite a <a href="rotator%20cuff">rotator cuff</a> injury during the 1985 season, Smith posted career highs in multiple offensive categories in 1987. Smith continued to earn Gold Gloves and All-Star appearances on an annual basis until 1993. During 1995 season, Smith had shoulder surgery and was out nearly three months. After tension with his new manager <a href="Tony%20La%20Russa">Tony La Russa</a> developed in 1996, Smith retired at season's end, and his uniform number (No. 1) was subsequently retired by the Cardinals. Smith also served as host of the television show "<a href="This%20Week%20in%20Baseball">This Week in Baseball</a>" from 1997 to 1998.

Smith was born in <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>, the second of Clovi and Marvella Smith's six children (five boys and one girl). While the family lived in Mobile, his father worked as a sandblaster at <a href="Brookley%20Air%20Force%20Base">Brookley Air Force Base</a>. When Smith was six his family moved to the <a href="Watts%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Watts</a> section of Los Angeles. His father became a delivery truck driver for <a href="Safeway%20Inc.">Safeway</a> stores, while his mother became an aide at a <a href="nursing%20home">nursing home</a>. His mother was an influential part of his life who stressed the importance of education and encouraged him to pursue his dreams.

Smith played a variety of sports in his youth, but considered baseball to be his favorite. He developed quick reflexes through various athletic and leisure activity, such as bouncing a ball off the concrete steps in front of his house, moving in closer to reduce reaction time with each throw. When not at the local <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> or playing sports, Smith sometimes went with friends to the neighborhood lumberyard, springboarding off inner tubes and doing flips into sawdust piles (a precursor to his famous backflips). In 1965, at age ten, he endured the <a href="Watts%20Riots">Watts Riots</a> with his family, recalling that, "We had to sleep on the floor because of all the sniping and looting going on."

While Smith was attending <a href="middle%20school">junior high school</a>, his parents divorced. Continuing to pursue his interest in baseball, he would ride the bus for nearly an hour to reach <a href="Dodger%20Stadium">Dodger Stadium</a>, cheering for the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> at about 25 games a year. Upon becoming a student at <a href="Locke%20High%20School">Locke High School</a>, Smith played on the basketball and baseball teams. Smith was a teammate of future <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> player <a href="Marques%20Johnson">Marques Johnson</a> on the basketball team, and a teammate of future fellow Hall-of-Fame player <a href="Eddie%20Murray">Eddie Murray</a> on the baseball side. After high school Smith attended <a href="California%20Polytechnic%20State%20University">Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</a> in 1974 on a partial academic scholarship, and managed to <a href="Walk-on%20%28sport%20term%29">walk-on</a> to the <a href="Cal%20Poly%20Mustangs%20baseball">baseball team</a>. In addition to his academic education, he learned to <a href="switch%20hitter">switch-hit</a> from Cal Poly coach Berdy Harr. When Cal Poly's starting shortstop broke his leg midway through the 1974 season, Smith subsequently took over the starting role. Later named an All-American athlete, he established school records in career <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>s (754) and career <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a>s (110) before graduating in 1977.

Smith was playing semi-professional baseball in <a href="Clarinda%2C%20Iowa">Clarinda, Iowa</a>, when in June 1976 he was selected in the seventh round of the <a href="1976%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">amateur entry draft</a> by the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>. The parties could not agree on a contract; Smith wanted a $10,000 ($ today) signing bonus, while the Tigers offered $8,500 ($ today). Smith returned to Cal Poly for his senior year, then in the <a href="1977%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">1977 draft</a> was selected in the fourth round by the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a>, ultimately agreeing to a contract that included a $5,000 signing bonus ($ today). Smith spent his first year of professional baseball during 1977 with the Class A <a href="Walla%20Walla%20Padres">Walla Walla Padres</a> of the <a href="Northwest%20League">Northwest League</a>.

Smith began 1978 as a non-roster invitee to the San Diego Padres' spring training camp in <a href="Yuma%2C%20Arizona">Yuma, Arizona</a>. Smith credited Padres manager <a href="Alvin%20Dark">Alvin Dark</a> for giving him confidence by telling reporters the shortstop job was Smith's until he proved he can't handle it. Even though Dark was fired in the middle of training camp, Smith made his <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) debut on April 7, 1978.

It did not take long for Smith to earn recognition in the major leagues, making what some consider his greatest fielding play only ten games into his rookie season. The Padres played host to the <a href="1978%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Atlanta Braves</a> on April 20, 1978, and with two out in the top of the fourth inning, Atlanta's <a href="Jeff%20Burroughs">Jeff Burroughs</a> hit a ground ball up the middle. Smith described the play by saying, "He hit a ball back up the middle that everybody thought was going into center field. I instinctively broke to my left and dove behind second. As I was in the air, the ball took a bad hop and caromed behind me, but I was able to catch it with my bare hand. I hit the ground, bounced back up, and threw Burroughs out at first."
During a roadtrip to <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, later in the season, Smith met a part-time usherette at the <a href="Reliant%20Astrodome">Astrodome</a> named Denise while making his way to the team bus outside the stadium. The couple developed a relationship that was sometimes long-distance in nature, and eventually decided to <a href="marriage">marry</a>. It was also during the 1978 season that Smith introduced a signature move. Padres promotion director Andy Strasberg knew Smith could perform backflips, but that he only did them during practice before fans entered the stadium. Strasberg asked Smith to do a backflip for fans during Fan Appreciation Day on October 1, the Padres' last home game of the season. After conferring with veteran teammate <a href="Gene%20Tenace">Gene Tenace</a>, Smith went ahead with the backflip, and it proved to be wildly popular. Smith finished the 1978 season with a .258 batting average and .970 fielding percentage, placing second in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">National League Rookie of the Year</a> voting to <a href="Bob%20Horner">Bob Horner</a>.

After working with a hitting instructor during the offseason, Smith failed to record a base hit in his first 32 at-bats of the 1979 season. Among players with enough at-bats to qualify for the 1979 National League Triple Crown, Smith finished the season last in batting average (.211), home runs (0), and RBI (27). Off the field, conflict developed between Padres' ownership and the combination of Smith and his agent, Ed Gottlieb. The parties entered into a contract dispute before the 1980 season, and when negotiations lasted into spring training, the Padres renewed Smith's contract at his 1979 salary of $72,500 Smith's agent told the Padres the shortstop would forgo the season to race in the Tour de France, despite the fact Smith admitted to The Break Room on 96.5 WCMF in Rochester, New York he had never heard of the Tour. Angered by the Padres' attitude during those contract talks, Gottlieb took out a help-wanted ad in the <a href="The%20San%20Diego%20Union-Tribune">"San Diego Union"</a>, part of which read, "Padre baseball player wants part-time employment to supplement income." When Joan Kroc, wife of Padres owner <a href="Ray%20Kroc">Ray Kroc</a>, publicly offered Smith a job as an assistant gardener on her estate, Smith and Gottlieb's relationship with the organization deteriorated further.

Meanwhile, Smith was winning recognition for his accomplishments on the field. In 1980, he set the single-season record for most assists by a shortstop (621), and began his string of 13 consecutive <a href="Rawlings%20Gold%20Glove%20Award">Gold Glove awards</a>. Smith's fielding play prompted the "Yuma Daily Sun" to use the nickname "The Wizard of Oz" in a March 1981 feature article about Smith. While "The Wizard of Oz" nickname was an allusion to the <a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29">1939 motion picture</a> of the same name, Smith also came to be known as simply "The Wizard" during his playing career, as Smith's Baseball Hall of Fame plaque would later attest. In 1981, Smith made his first <a href="1981%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Game appearance</a> as a reserve player.

While Smith was having problems with the Padres' owners, the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> also found themselves unhappy with their shortstop, <a href="Garry%20Templeton">Garry Templeton</a>. Templeton's relationship with <a href="Cardinal%20Nation">Cardinal Nation</a> had become increasingly strained and finally came to a head during a game at <a href="Busch%20Memorial%20Stadium">Busch Stadium</a> on August 26, 1981, when (after being heckled for not running out a ground ball) he made obscene gestures at fans, and had to be physically pulled off the field by manager <a href="Whitey%20Herzog">Whitey Herzog</a>.

Given the task of overhauling the Cardinals by owner <a href="Gussie%20Busch">Gussie Busch</a> (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager <a href="Jack%20McKeon">Jack McKeon</a> at the 1981 <a href="Winter%20meetings">baseball winter meetings</a>. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager <a href="Dick%20Williams">Dick Williams</a> informed Herzog that a <a href="no-trade%20clause">no-trade clause</a> had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, but he was still interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be."

On December 10, 1981, the Padres traded him (along with a player to be named later and <a href="Steve%20Mura">Steve Mura</a> to the Cardinals for a player to be named later, <a href="Sixto%20Lezcano">Sixto Lezcano</a> and <a href="Garry%20Templeton">Garry Templeton</a>. The teams completed the trade on February 19, 1982, with the Padres sending <a href="Al%20Olmsted">Al Olmsted</a> to the Cardinals, with St. Louis sending <a href="Luis%20DeLeon">Luis DeLeon</a> to the Padres. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool designed to help Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, "Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year." Smith agreed to the wager, and by the end of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the <a href="1982%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">1982 season</a> got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense."

Smith became a father for the first time during the 1982 season with the birth of his son O.J., today known as <a href="Nikko%20Smith">Nikko</a>, on April 28. Smith also developed a lasting friendship with teammate <a href="Willie%20McGee">Willie McGee</a> during the season, and Smith said he likes to think he "helped Willie get over some of the rough spots of adjusting to the major leagues". Smith later participated in the postseason for the first time when the <a href="1982%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">Cardinals</a> faced the <a href="1982%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Atlanta Braves</a> in the best-of-five <a href="1982%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">1982 National League Championship Series</a> (NLCS). Smith drove in the series' first run by hitting a <a href="sacrifice%20fly">sacrifice fly</a> that scored McGee in Game 1, ultimately going five for nine in St. Louis' three-game series sweep.

Just as Herzog had predicted when he told Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant with him on the team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven <a href="1982%20World%20Series">1982 World Series</a> against the <a href="1982%20Milwaukee%20Brewers%20season">Milwaukee Brewers</a>. During the contest Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not commit an error in the field. When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 with one out in the sixth inning of <a href="1982%20World%20Series%23Game%207">Game 7</a>, Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the team's three runs that inning. The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.

After the World Series championship, Smith and the Cardinals agreed on a new contract in January 1983 that paid Smith $1 million per year. Smith was voted in as the National League's starting shortstop in the <a href="1983%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Game</a> for the first time in 1983, and at season's end won a fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award. During July of the 1984 season, Smith went on the <a href="disabled%20list">disabled list</a> with a broken wrist after being hit by a pitch during a game against the Padres. Smith's return to the lineup a month later was not enough to propel the Cardinals to a postseason berth.

In 1985, Smith amassed a .276 batting average, 31 stolen bases, and 591 assists in the field. The Cardinals as a team won 101 games during the season and earned another postseason berth. Facing the <a href="1985%20Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers%20season">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> in the now best-of-seven <a href="1985%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">NLCS</a>, a split of the first four games set the stage for <a href="1985%20NLCS%23Game%205">Game 5</a> at Busch Stadium. With the score tied at two runs apiece in the bottom of the ninth inning, Dodgers manager <a href="Tommy%20Lasorda">Tommy Lasorda</a> called upon closer <a href="Tom%20Niedenfuer">Tom Niedenfuer</a> to pitch. Smith batted left-handed against Niedenfuer with one out. Smith, who had never hit a home run in his previous 3,009 left-handed major league at-bats, pulled an inside fastball down the right-field line for a walk-off home run, ending Game 5 in a 3–2 Cardinals victory. Smith said, "I was trying to get an extra-base hit and get into scoring position. Fortunately, I was able to get the ball up." The home run not only prompted broadcaster <a href="Jack%20Buck">Jack Buck</a>'s "Go crazy folks" play-by-play call, but was also later voted the greatest moment in Busch Stadium history by Cardinals fans.

After Smith's teammate <a href="Jack%20Clark%20%28baseball%29">Jack Clark</a> hit a late-inning home run of his own in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on to face the <a href="1985%20Kansas%20City%20Royals%20season">Kansas City Royals</a> in the <a href="1985%20World%20Series">1985 World Series</a>. Once again sportswriters were quick to draw attention to Smith's outstanding defensive play instead of his 2 for 23 effort at the plate. After the Cardinals took a three-games-to-two advantage, a controversial <a href="1985%20World%20Series%23Game%206">Game 6</a> call by umpire <a href="Don%20Denkinger">Don Denkinger</a> overshadowed the remainder of the Series (which the Royals won in seven games).

What was not publicly known during the regular season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his <a href="rotator%20cuff">rotator cuff</a> after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres. After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a <a href="pickoff">pickoff</a> throw, Smith altered his throwing motion to such a degree that the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed. The 5'10" (1.78 m), 180-pound (82 kg) Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered. Said Smith, "I didn't tell anybody about the injury, because I wanted to keep playing and didn't want anybody thinking they could run on me or take advantage of the injury. I tried to do almost everything, except throw a baseball, left-handed: opening a door, turning on the radio—everything. It didn't get any better, but it was good enough that I didn't have to have surgery."

Because of his injury, Smith let his then four-year-old son Nikko perform his traditional Opening Day backflip before the Cardinals' first home game of the 1986 season. Smith made an "eye-popping" play later that season on August 5, during a game against the <a href="1986%20Philadelphia%20Phillies%20season">Philadelphia Phillies</a> at Busch Stadium. In the top of the ninth inning, Phillies first baseman <a href="Von%20Hayes">Von Hayes</a> hit a short fly ball to left field, which was pursued by both Smith and left fielder <a href="Curt%20Ford">Curt Ford</a>. Running with his back to home plate, Smith dove forward, simultaneously catching the ball while parallel to the ground and flying over the diving Ford, avoiding a collision by inches.

After hitting in either the second or eighth spot in the batting order for most of his time in St. Louis, Herzog made Smith the number-two hitter full-time during the 1987 season. Over the course of the year, Smith accrued a .303 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a>, 43 stolen bases, 75 <a href="Runs%20batted%20in">RBI</a>s, 104 <a href="Run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a> scored, and 40 <a href="Double%20%28baseball%29">doubles</a>, good enough to earn him the <a href="Silver%20Slugger%20Award">Silver Slugger Award</a> <a href="List%20of%20NL%20Silver%20Slugger%20winners%20at%20shortstop">at shortstop</a>. In addition to winning the Gold Glove Award at shortstop for the eighth consecutive time, Smith posted a career-high <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a> of .392. Smith was also the leading vote-getter in the <a href="1987%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">1987 All-Star Game</a>. The Cardinals earned a postseason berth with 95 wins, and subsequently faced the <a href="1987%20San%20Francisco%20Giants%20season">San Francisco Giants</a> in the <a href="1987%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">1987 National League Championship Series</a>. Smith contributed a triple during the series, and the Cardinals won the contest in seven games.

The <a href="1987%20World%20Series">1987 World Series</a> matched the <a href="1987%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">Cardinals</a> against the American League champion <a href="1987%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">Minnesota Twins</a>. The home team won every game of the contest, as Minnesota won the series. In 28 at-bats during the Series, Smith scored three runs and had two RBIs. Smith finished second in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">MVP</a> balloting to <a href="Andre%20Dawson">Andre Dawson</a>, who had played on the last-place <a href="1987%20Chicago%20Cubs%20season">Chicago Cubs</a>, largely because Smith and teammate <a href="Jack%20Clark%20%28baseball%29">Jack Clark</a> split the first-place vote. Following the 1987 season, Smith was awarded the largest contract in the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> at $2,340,000.

While the team did not see the postseason for the remainder of the decade, Smith continued to rack up All-Star appearances and Gold Gloves. Combined with the attention he received from his contract, Smith continued to be a national figure. Known as a savvy dresser, he made the April 1988 cover of "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>" magazine. Smith was witness to change within the Cardinal organization when owner <a href="Gussie%20Busch">Gussie Busch</a> died in 1989 and Herzog quit as manager during the 1990 season.

<a href="Joe%20Torre">Joe Torre</a> became Smith's new manager in 1990, but the team did not reach the postseason during Torre's nearly five-year tenure. While the Cardinals celebrated their 100th anniversary in 1992, Smith marked milestones of his own, stealing his 500th career base on April 26, then notching a triple on May 26 in front of the home crowd for his 2,000th hit. <a href="1992%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">St. Louis</a> had a one-game lead in the National League East division on June 1, 1992, but injuries took their toll on the team, including Smith's two-week illness in late July after contracting <a href="chicken%20pox">chicken pox</a> for the first time. As a testament to his national visibility during this time, Smith appeared in a 1992 episode of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" titled "<a href="Homer%20at%20the%20Bat">Homer at the Bat</a>". Smith became a free agent for the first time in his career on November 2, 1992, only to sign a new contract with the Cardinals on December 6.

Smith won his final Gold Glove in 1992, and his 13 consecutive Gold Gloves at <a href="List%20of%20NL%20Gold%20Glove%20winners%20at%20shortstop">shortstop</a> in the National League has yet to be matched. The 1993 season marked the only time between 1981 and 1996 that Smith failed to make the All-Star team, and Smith finished the 1993 season with a .288 batting average and .974 fielding percentage. He appeared in 98 games during the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20strike">strike-shortened</a> 1994 season, and later missed nearly three months of the 1995 season after shoulder surgery on May 31. Smith was recognized for his community service efforts with the <a href="Branch%20Rickey%20Award">1994 Branch Rickey Award</a> and the <a href="Roberto%20Clemente%20Award">1995 Roberto Clemente Award</a>. In February 1994, Smith took on the role of honorary chairman and official spokesman for the Missouri Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Health.

As Smith entered the 1996 season, he finalized a divorce from his wife Denise during the first half of the year. Meanwhile, manager <a href="Tony%20La%20Russa">Tony La Russa</a> began his first season with the Cardinals in tandem with a new ownership group. After General Manager <a href="Walt%20Jocketty">Walt Jocketty</a> acquired shortstop <a href="Royce%20Clayton">Royce Clayton</a> during the offseason, La Russa emphasized an open competition for the spot that would give the Cardinals the best chance to win. When spring training concluded, Smith had amassed a .288 batting average and zero errors in the field, and Clayton batted .190 with eight errors. Smith believed he had earned the position with his spring training performance, but La Russa disagreed, and awarded Clayton the majority of playing time in the <a href="platoon%20system">platoon situation</a> that developed, where Smith typically saw action every third game. La Russa said, "I think it's fair to say he misunderstood how he compared to Royce in spring training ... When I and the coaches evaluated the play in spring training—the whole game—Royce started very slowly offensively and you could see him start to get better. By what he was able to do defensively and on the bases, Royce deserved to play the majority of the games."

Smith missed the first month of the season with a <a href="hamstring">hamstring</a> injury, and continued to harbor ill feelings toward La Russa that had developed after spring training ended. In a closed-door meeting in mid-May, La Russa asked Smith if he would like to be traded. Instead, Smith and his agent negotiated a compromise with Cardinals management, agreeing to a buyout of special provisions in his contract in conjunction with Smith announcing his retirement. The agreement prompted a press conference at Busch Stadium on June 19, 1996, during which Smith announced he would retire from baseball at season's end.
As Smith made his final tour of the National League, he was honored by many teams, and received a standing ovation at the <a href="1996%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">1996 All-Star Game</a> in Philadelphia. Between June 19 and September 1, Smith's batting average increased from .239 to .286. On September 2 Smith tied a career high by scoring four runs, one of which was a home run, and another on a close play at <a href="home%20plate">home plate</a> in the bottom of the 10th inning against division leader <a href="1996%20Houston%20Astros%20season">Houston</a>. The victory moved the <a href="1996%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">Cardinals</a> to within a half game of Houston in the <a href="National%20League%20Central">National League Central Division</a>, and the Cardinals went on to win the division by six games. The Cardinals held a special ceremony at Busch Stadium on September 28, 1996, before a game against the <a href="1996%20Cincinnati%20Reds%20season">Cincinnati Reds</a>, honoring Smith by retiring his uniform number. Noted for his ritual backflip before Opening Days, All-Star Games, and postseason games, Smith chose this occasion to perform it for one of the last times.

In the postseason, the Cardinals first faced the <a href="1996%20San%20Diego%20Padres%20season">San Diego Padres</a> in the <a href="1996%20National%20League%20Division%20Series">1996 National League Division Series</a>. After sitting out Game 1, Smith got the start in Game 2 at Busch Stadium, helping his team go up two games in the series by notching a run, a hit and two walks at the plate, along with an assist and a putout in the field. The Cardinals then swept the series by winning Game 3 in San Diego.

The Cardinals faced the <a href="1996%20Atlanta%20Braves%20season">Atlanta Braves</a> in the <a href="1996%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">1996 National League Championship Series</a>. Smith started Game 1 and subsequently registered three putouts and one assist in the field, but went hitless in four at-bats in the Cardinals' 4–2 loss. The Cardinals then won Games 2, 3, and 4, contests in which Smith did not appear. Upon receiving the start in Game 5, Smith nearly duplicated his Game 1 performance with four putouts, one assist, and zero hits in four at-bats as part of another Cardinals defeat. The Cardinals also failed to win Game 6 or Game 7 in Atlanta, ending their season. When the Cardinals were trailing by ten runs during Game 7 on October 17, Smith flied out to right field while pinch-hitting in the sixth inning, marking the end of his playing career. Smith finished his career with distinctions ranging from the accumulation of more than 27.5 million votes in All-Star balloting, to holding the record for the most MLB at-bats without hitting a <a href="grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29">grand slam</a>.

Upon retirement, Smith took over for <a href="Mel%20Allen">Mel Allen</a> as the host of the television series "<a href="This%20Week%20in%20Baseball">This Week in Baseball</a>" ("TWIB") in 1997. Smith also became <a href="color%20commentator">color commentator</a> for the local broadcast of Cardinals games on <a href="KPLR-TV">KPLR-TV</a> from 1997 to 1999. When his stint on "This Week in Baseball" concluded, Smith then moved on to do work for <a href="CNN%20Sports%20Illustrated">CNN-SI</a> beginning in 1999. After La Russa retired as manager of the Cardinals in 2011, Smith became active in the organization again, starting with his stint as a special instructor for the team's 2012 spring training camp.

On January 8, 2002 Smith learned via a phone call he had been elected to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> on his first ballot by receiving 91.7% of the votes cast. As it happened, the <a href="Olympic%20torch">Olympic torch</a> was passing through St. Louis on its way to <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a> for the <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a>, and Smith served as a torchbearer in a ceremony with <a href="St.%20Louis%20Rams">St. Louis Rams</a>' quarterback <a href="Kurt%20Warner">Kurt Warner</a> that evening. Smith was inducted into the Hall of Fame during ceremonies on July 28, 2002. During his speech, he compared his baseball experiences with the characters from the novel "<a href="The%20Wonderful%20Wizard%20of%20Oz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a>", after which his son Dustin presented his Hall of Fame plaque. Days later on August 11, Smith was back at <a href="Busch%20Memorial%20Stadium">Busch Memorial Stadium</a> for the unveiling of a statue in his likeness made by sculptor <a href="Harry%20Weber%20%28sculptor%29">Harry Weber</a>. Weber chose to emphasize Smith's defensive skills by showing Smith stretched horizontal to the ground while fielding a baseball. At the ceremony Weber told Smith, "You spent half of your career up in the air. That makes it difficult for a sculptor to do something with it."

Smith has also been an entrepreneur in a variety of business ventures. Smith opened "Ozzie's" restaurant and sports bar in 1988, started a youth sports academy in 1990, became an investor in a grocery store chain in 1999, and partnered with David Slay to open a restaurant in the early 2000s. Of those businesses the youth academy remains in operation, with the restaurant having closed in 2010 after changing ownership and locations once. Aside from appearing in numerous radio and television commercials in the St. Louis area since retiring from baseball, Smith authored a children's book in 2006 and launched his own brand of salad dressing in 2008.

Besides the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Smith has been also inducted or honored in other halls of fame and recognitions. In 1999, he ranked number 87 on "<a href="The%20Sporting%20News">The Sporting News</a>"' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and finished third in voting at shortstop for the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Century%20Team">Major League Baseball All-Century Team</a>. He was honored with induction into the <a href="Missouri%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Missouri Sports Hall of Fame</a>, <a href="Alabama%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Alabama Sports Hall of Fame</a> and the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Walk%20of%20Fame">St. Louis Walk of Fame</a>, and received an honorary <a href="Doctor%20of%20Humane%20Letters">Doctor of Humane Letters</a> degree from Cal Poly. In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Smith among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Museum">St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum</a> for the inaugural class of <a href="2014%20St.%20Louis%20Cardinals%20season">2014</a>.

Smith is the father to three children from his marriage to former wife Denise; sons <a href="Nikko%20Smith">Nikko</a> and Dustin, and daughter Taryn. Smith remains a visible figure around the St. Louis area, making varied appearances like playing the role of the Wizard in the <a href="The%20Muny">St. Louis Municipal Opera</a>'s summer 2001 production of "The Wizard of Oz". Smith cheered on his son Nikko as he cracked the top ten finalists of the <a href="American%20Idol%20%28season%204%29">2005 edition</a> of "<a href="American%20Idol">American Idol</a>". In 2012, Smith made news headlines again, when he sold all of his Gold Gloves at auction together for more than $500,000.

Pi

The number () is a <a href="mathematical%20constant">mathematical constant</a>. Originally defined as the <a href="ratio">ratio</a> of a <a href="circle">circle</a>'s <a href="circumference">circumference</a> to its <a href="diameter">diameter</a>, it now has various equivalent definitions and appears in many formulas in all areas of <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="physics">physics</a>. It is approximately equal to 3.14159. It has been represented by the Greek letter "<a href="Pi%20%28letter%29"></a>" since the mid-18th century, though it is also sometimes spelled out as "pi". It is also called Archimedes' constant.

Being an <a href="irrational%20number">irrational number</a>, cannot be expressed as a <a href="common%20fraction">common fraction</a> (equivalently, its <a href="decimal%20representation">decimal representation</a> never ends and never <a href="repeating%20decimal">settles into a permanently repeating pattern</a>). Still, fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used to <a href="Approximations%20of%20%CF%80">approximate</a> . The digits appear to be <a href="random%20sequence">randomly distributed</a>. In particular, the digit sequence of is conjectured to satisfy a <a href="normal%20number">specific kind of statistical randomness</a>, but to date, no proof of this has been discovered. Also, is a <a href="transcendental%20number">transcendental number</a>; that is, it is not the <a href="Root%20of%20a%20polynomial">root</a> of any <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a> having <a href="Rational%20number">rational</a> <a href="coefficient">coefficient</a>s. This transcendence of implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of <a href="squaring%20the%20circle">squaring the circle</a> with a <a href="Compass-and-straightedge%20construction">compass and straightedge</a>.

<a href="History%20of%20mathematics">Ancient civilizations</a> required fairly accurate computed values to approximate for practical reasons, including the <a href="Egyptian%20mathematics">Egyptians</a> and <a href="Babylonian%20mathematics">Babylonians</a>. Around 250 BC the <a href="Greek%20mathematics">Greek mathematician</a> <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> created an algorithm for calculating it. In the 5th century AD <a href="Chinese%20mathematics">Chinese mathematics</a> approximated to seven digits, while <a href="Indian%20mathematics">Indian mathematics</a> made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques. The historically first exact formula for , based on <a href="Series%20%28mathematics%29">infinite series</a>, was not available until a millennium later, when in the 14th century the <a href="Leibniz%20formula%20for%20pi">Madhava–Leibniz series</a> was discovered in Indian mathematics. In the 20th and 21st centuries, mathematicians and <a href="computer%20science">computer scientists</a> discovered new approaches that, when combined with increasing computational power, extended the decimal representation of to many trillions of digits after the decimal point. Practically all scientific applications require no more than a few hundred digits of , and many substantially fewer, so the primary motivation for these computations is the quest to find more efficient algorithms for calculating lengthy numeric series, as well as the desire to break records. The extensive calculations involved have also been used to test <a href="supercomputer">supercomputer</a>s and high-precision multiplication <a href="algorithms">algorithms</a>.

Because its most elementary definition relates to the circle, is found in many formulae in <a href="trigonometry">trigonometry</a> and <a href="geometry">geometry</a>, especially those concerning circles, ellipses, and spheres. In more modern <a href="mathematical%20analysis">mathematical analysis</a>, the number is instead defined using the spectral properties of the <a href="real%20number">real number</a> system, as an <a href="eigenvalue">eigenvalue</a> or a <a href="periodic%20function">period</a>, without any reference to geometry. It appears therefore in areas of mathematics and the sciences having little to do with the geometry of circles, such as <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a> and <a href="statistics">statistics</a>, as well as in almost all areas of <a href="physics">physics</a>. The ubiquity of makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants both inside and outside the scientific community. Several books devoted to have been published, and record-setting calculations of the digits of often result in news headlines. Attempts to <a href="Piphilology">memorize the value of</a> with increasing precision have led to records of over 70,000 digits.

The symbol used by mathematicians to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is the lowercase <a href="Pi%20%28letter%29">Greek letter</a>, sometimes spelled out as "pi," and derived from the first letter of the Greek word "perimetros," meaning circumference. In English, is <a href="English%20pronunciation%20of%20Greek%20letters">pronounced as "pie"</a> ( ). In mathematical use, the lowercase letter (or π in <a href="sans-serif">sans-serif</a> font) is distinguished from its capitalized and enlarged counterpart , which denotes a <a href="product%20of%20a%20sequence">product of a sequence</a>, analogous to how denotes <a href="summation">summation</a>.

The choice of the symbol is discussed in the section <a href="%23Adoption%20of%20the%20symbol%20%CF%80">"Adoption of the symbol "</a>.

 is commonly defined as the <a href="ratio">ratio</a> of a <a href="circle">circle</a>'s <a href="circumference">circumference</a> to its <a href="diameter">diameter</a> :
The ratio is constant, regardless of the circle's size. For example, if a circle has twice the diameter of another circle it will also have twice the circumference, preserving the ratio . This definition of implicitly makes use of <a href="Euclidean%20geometry">flat (Euclidean) geometry</a>; although the notion of a circle can be extended to any <a href="Non-Euclidean%20geometry">curved (non-Euclidean) geometry</a>, these new circles will no longer satisfy the formula .

Here, the circumference of a circle is the <a href="arc%20length">arc length</a> around the perimeter of the circle, a quantity which can be formally defined independently of geometry using <a href="limit%20%28mathematics%29">limits</a>, a concept in <a href="calculus">calculus</a>. For example, one may directly compute the arc length of the top half of the unit circle, given in <a href="Cartesian%20coordinates">Cartesian coordinates</a> by the equation , as the <a href="integral">integral</a>:
An integral such as this was adopted as the definition of by <a href="Karl%20Weierstrass">Karl Weierstrass</a>, who defined it directly as an integral in 1841.

Definitions of such as these that rely on a notion of circumference, and hence implicitly on concepts of the <a href="integral%20calculus">integral calculus</a>, are no longer common in the literature. explains that this is because in many modern treatments of calculus, <a href="differential%20calculus">differential calculus</a> typically precedes integral calculus in the university curriculum, so it is desirable to have a definition of that does not rely on the latter. One such definition, due to <a href="Richard%20Baltzer">Richard Baltzer</a>, and popularized by <a href="Edmund%20Landau">Edmund Landau</a>, is the following: is twice the smallest positive number at which the <a href="cosine">cosine function</a> equals 0. The cosine can be defined independently of geometry as a <a href="power%20series">power series</a>, or as the solution of a <a href="differential%20equation">differential equation</a>.

In a similar spirit, can be defined instead using properties of the <a href="complex%20exponential">complex exponential</a>, , of a <a href="complex%20number">complex</a> variable . Like the cosine, the complex exponential can be defined in one of several ways. The set of complex numbers at which is equal to one is then an (imaginary) arithmetic progression of the form:
and there is a unique positive real number with this property.
A more abstract variation on the same idea, making use of sophisticated mathematical concepts of <a href="topology">topology</a> and <a href="algebra">algebra</a>, is the following theorem: there is a unique (<a href="up%20to">up to</a> <a href="automorphism">automorphism</a>) <a href="continuous%20function">continuous</a> <a href="isomorphism">isomorphism</a> from the <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">group</a> R/Z of real numbers under addition <a href="quotient%20group">modulo</a> integers (the <a href="circle%20group">circle group</a>) onto the multiplicative group of <a href="complex%20numbers">complex numbers</a> of <a href="absolute%20value">absolute value</a> one. The number is then defined as half the magnitude of the derivative of this homomorphism.

A circle encloses the largest area that can be attained within a given perimeter. Thus the number is also characterized as the best constant in the <a href="isoperimetric%20inequality">isoperimetric inequality</a> (times one-fourth). There are many other, closely related, ways in which appears as an <a href="eigenvalue">eigenvalue</a> of some geometrical or physical process; see <a href="%23Eigenvalues">below</a>.

 is an <a href="irrational%20number">irrational number</a>, meaning that it cannot be written as the <a href="rational%20number">ratio of two integers</a> (fractions such as are commonly used to approximate , but no <a href="common%20fraction">common fraction</a> (ratio of whole numbers) can be its exact value). Because is irrational, it has an infinite number of digits in its <a href="decimal%20representation">decimal representation</a>, and it does not settle into an infinitely <a href="repeating%20decimal">repeating pattern</a> of digits. There are several <a href="proof%20that%20%CF%80%20is%20irrational">proofs that is irrational</a>; they generally require calculus and rely on the "<a href="reductio%20ad%20absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a>" technique. The degree to which can be approximated by <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s (called the <a href="irrationality%20measure">irrationality measure</a>) is not precisely known; estimates have established that the irrationality measure is larger than the measure of or but smaller than the measure of <a href="Liouville%20number">Liouville number</a>s.

The digits of have no apparent pattern and have passed tests for <a href="statistical%20randomness">statistical randomness</a>, including tests for <a href="normal%20number">normality</a>; a number of infinite length is called normal when all possible sequences of digits (of any given length) appear equally often. The conjecture that is <a href="normal%20number">normal</a> has not been proven or disproven.

Since the advent of computers, a large number of digits of have been available on which to perform statistical analysis. <a href="Yasumasa%20Kanada">Yasumasa Kanada</a> has performed detailed statistical analyses on the decimal digits of and found them consistent with normality; for example, the frequencies of the ten digits 0 to 9 were subjected to <a href="statistical%20significance%20test">statistical significance test</a>s, and no evidence of a pattern was found. Any random sequence of digits contains arbitrarily long subsequences that appear non-random, by the <a href="infinite%20monkey%20theorem">infinite monkey theorem</a>. Thus, because the sequence of 's digits passes statistical tests for randomness, it contains some sequences of digits that may appear non-random, such as a <a href="Six%20nines%20in%20pi">sequence of six consecutive 9s</a> that begins at the 762nd decimal place of the decimal representation of . This is also called the "Feynman point" in <a href="mathematical%20folklore">mathematical folklore</a>, after <a href="Richard%20Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>, although no connection to Feynman is known.

In addition to being irrational, more strongly is a <a href="transcendental%20number">transcendental number</a>, which means that it is not the <a href="solution%20%28equation%29">solution</a> of any non-constant <a href="polynomial%20equation">polynomial equation</a> with <a href="rational%20number">rational</a> coefficients, such as .

The transcendence of has two important consequences: First, cannot be expressed using any finite combination of rational numbers and square roots or <a href="nth%20root">"n"-th roots</a> such as or . Second, since no transcendental number can be <a href="Constructible%20number">constructed</a> with <a href="Compass-and-straightedge%20construction">compass and straightedge</a>, it is not possible to "<a href="squaring%20the%20circle">square the circle</a>". In other words, it is impossible to construct, using compass and straightedge alone, a square whose area is exactly equal to the area of a given circle. Squaring a circle was one of the important geometry problems of the <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>. Amateur mathematicians in modern times have sometimes attempted to square the circle and sometimes claim success despite the fact that it is mathematically impossible.

Like all irrational numbers, cannot be represented as a <a href="common%20fraction">common fraction</a> (also known as a <a href="Simple%20fractions">simple</a> or <a href="vulgar%20fraction">vulgar fraction</a>), by the very definition of "irrational number" (that is, "not a rational number"). But every irrational number, including , can be represented by an infinite series of nested fractions, called a <a href="continued%20fraction">continued fraction</a>:

Truncating the continued fraction at any point yields a rational approximation for ; the first four of these are 3, 22/7, 333/106, and 355/113. These numbers are among the most well-known and widely used historical approximations of the constant. Each approximation generated in this way is a best rational approximation; that is, each is closer to than any other fraction with the same or a smaller denominator. Because is known to be transcendental, it is by definition not <a href="algebraic%20number">algebraic</a> and so cannot be a <a href="quadratic%20irrational">quadratic irrational</a>. Therefore, cannot have a <a href="periodic%20continued%20fraction">periodic continued fraction</a>. Although the simple continued fraction for (shown above) also does not exhibit any other obvious pattern, mathematicians have discovered several <a href="generalized%20continued%20fraction">generalized continued fraction</a>s that do, such as:

Some <a href="approximations%20of%20%CF%80">approximations of "pi"</a> include:

Digits in other number systems

Any <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>, say , can be expressed using a pair of <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s. In the <a href="Polar%20coordinate%20system%23Complex%20numbers">polar coordinate system</a>, one number (<a href="radius">radius</a> or "r") is used to represent 's distance from the <a href="Origin%20%28mathematics%29">origin</a> of the <a href="complex%20plane">complex plane</a> and the other (angle or ) to represent a counter-clockwise <a href="rotation">rotation</a> from the positive real line as follows:
where is the <a href="imaginary%20unit">imaginary unit</a> satisfying = −1. The frequent appearance of in <a href="complex%20analysis">complex analysis</a> can be related to the behavior of the <a href="exponential%20function">exponential function</a> of a complex variable, described by <a href="Euler%27s%20formula">Euler's formula</a>:

where <a href="E%20%28mathematical%20constant%29">the constant</a> is the base of the <a href="natural%20logarithm">natural logarithm</a>. This formula establishes a correspondence between imaginary powers of and points on the <a href="unit%20circle">unit circle</a> centered at the origin of the complex plane. Setting = in Euler's formula results in <a href="Euler%27s%20identity">Euler's identity</a>, celebrated by mathematicians because it contains the five most important mathematical constants:

There are different <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s satisfying , and these are called the "-th <a href="root%20of%20unity">roots of unity</a>". They are given by this formula:

The best-known approximations to dating <a href="1st%20millennium%20BC">before the Common Era</a> were accurate to two decimal places; this was improved upon in <a href="Chinese%20mathematics">Chinese mathematics</a> in particular by the mid-first millennium, to an accuracy of seven decimal places.
After this, no further progress was made until the late medieval period.

Some Egyptologists have claimed that the <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>ians used an approximation of as from as early as the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a>.
This claim has met with skepticism.

The earliest written approximations of are found in <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, both within one percent of the true value. In Babylon, a <a href="clay%20tablet">clay tablet</a> dated 1900–1600 BC has a geometrical statement that, by implication, treats as  = 3.125. In Egypt, the <a href="Rhind%20Papyrus">Rhind Papyrus</a>, dated around 1650 BC but copied from a document dated to 1850 BC, has a formula for the area of a circle that treats as () ≈ 3.1605.

Astronomical calculations in the "<a href="Shatapatha%20Brahmana">Shatapatha Brahmana</a>" (ca. 4th century BC) use a fractional approximation of  ≈ 3.139 (an accuracy of 9×10). Other Indian sources by about 150 BC treat as  ≈ 3.1622.

The first recorded algorithm for rigorously calculating the value of was a geometrical approach using polygons, devised around 250 BC by the Greek mathematician <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a>. This polygonal algorithm dominated for over 1,000 years, and as a result is sometimes referred to as "Archimedes' constant". Archimedes computed upper and lower bounds of by drawing a regular hexagon inside and outside a circle, and successively doubling the number of sides until he reached a 96-sided regular polygon. By calculating the perimeters of these polygons, he proved that (that is ). Archimedes' upper bound of may have led to a widespread popular belief that is equal to . Around 150 AD, Greek-Roman scientist <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, in his "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>", gave a value for of 3.1416, which he may have obtained from Archimedes or from <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Perga">Apollonius of Perga</a>. Mathematicians using polygonal algorithms reached 39 digits of in 1630, a record only broken in 1699 when infinite series were used to reach 71 digits.
In <a href="ancient%20China">ancient China</a>, values for included 3.1547 (around 1 AD), (100 AD, approximately 3.1623), and (3rd century, approximately 3.1556). Around 265 AD, the <a href="Cao%20Wei">Wei Kingdom</a> mathematician <a href="Liu%20Hui">Liu Hui</a> created a <a href="Liu%20Hui%27s%20%CF%80%20algorithm">polygon-based iterative algorithm</a> and used it with a 3,072-sided polygon to obtain a value of of 3.1416. Liu later invented a faster method of calculating and obtained a value of 3.14 with a 96-sided polygon, by taking advantage of the fact that the differences in area of successive polygons form a geometric series with a factor of 4. The Chinese mathematician <a href="Zu%20Chongzhi">Zu Chongzhi</a>, around 480 AD, calculated that (a fraction that goes by the name "<a href="Mil%C3%BC">Milü</a>" in Chinese), using <a href="Liu%20Hui%27s%20%CF%80%20algorithm">Liu Hui's algorithm</a> applied to a 12,288-sided polygon. With a correct value for its seven first decimal digits, this value of 3.141592920 remained the most accurate approximation of available for the next 800 years.

The Indian astronomer <a href="Aryabhata">Aryabhata</a> used a value of 3.1416 in his "<a href="%C4%80ryabha%E1%B9%AD%C4%ABya">Āryabhaṭīya</a>" (499 AD). <a href="Fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> in c. 1220 computed 3.1418 using a polygonal method, independent of Archimedes. Italian author <a href="Dante">Dante</a> apparently employed the value .

The Persian astronomer <a href="Jamsh%C4%ABd%20al-K%C4%81sh%C4%AB">Jamshīd al-Kāshī</a> produced 9 sexagesimal digits, roughly the equivalent of 16 decimal digits, in 1424 using a polygon with 3×2 sides, which stood as the world record for about 180 years. French mathematician <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Vi%C3%A8te">François Viète</a> in 1579 achieved 9 digits with a polygon of 3×2 sides. Flemish mathematician <a href="Adriaan%20van%20Roomen">Adriaan van Roomen</a> arrived at 15 decimal places in 1593. In 1596, Dutch mathematician <a href="Ludolph%20van%20Ceulen">Ludolph van Ceulen</a> reached 20 digits, a record he later increased to 35 digits (as a result, was called the "Ludolphian number" in Germany until the early 20th century). Dutch scientist <a href="Willebrord%20Snellius">Willebrord Snellius</a> reached 34 digits in 1621, and Austrian astronomer <a href="Christoph%20Grienberger">Christoph Grienberger</a> arrived at 38 digits in 1630 using 10 sides, which remains the most accurate approximation manually achieved using polygonal algorithms.

The calculation of was revolutionized by the development of <a href="infinite%20series">infinite series</a> techniques in the 16th and 17th centuries. An infinite series is the sum of the terms of an infinite <a href="sequence%20%28mathematics%29">sequence</a>. Infinite series allowed mathematicians to compute with much greater precision than <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> and others who used geometrical techniques. Although infinite series were exploited for most notably by European mathematicians such as <a href="James%20Gregory%20%28mathematician%29">James Gregory</a> and <a href="Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a>, the approach was first discovered in <a href="India">India</a> sometime between 1400 and 1500 AD. The first written description of an infinite series that could be used to compute was laid out in Sanskrit verse by Indian astronomer <a href="Nilakantha%20Somayaji">Nilakantha Somayaji</a> in his "<a href="Tantrasamgraha">Tantrasamgraha</a>", around 1500 AD. The series are presented without proof, but proofs are presented in a later Indian work, "<a href="Yuktibh%C4%81%E1%B9%A3%C4%81">Yuktibhāṣā</a>", from around 1530 AD. Nilakantha attributes the series to an earlier Indian mathematician, <a href="Madhava%20of%20Sangamagrama">Madhava of Sangamagrama</a>, who lived c. 1350 – c. 1425. Several infinite series are described, including series for sine, tangent, and cosine, which are now referred to as the <a href="Madhava%20series">Madhava series</a> or <a href="Leibniz%20formula%20for%20%CF%80">Gregory–Leibniz series</a>. Madhava used infinite series to estimate to 11 digits around 1400, but that value was improved on around 1430 by the Persian mathematician <a href="Jamsh%C4%ABd%20al-K%C4%81sh%C4%AB">Jamshīd al-Kāshī</a>, using a polygonal algorithm.
The <a href="Vi%C3%A8te%27s%20formula">first infinite sequence discovered in Europe</a> was an <a href="infinite%20product">infinite product</a> (rather than an <a href="infinite%20sum">infinite sum</a>, which are more typically used in calculations) found by French mathematician <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Vi%C3%A8te">François Viète</a> in 1593:

The <a href="Wallis%20product">second infinite sequence found in Europe</a>, by <a href="John%20Wallis">John Wallis</a> in 1655, was also an infinite product:
The discovery of <a href="calculus">calculus</a>, by English scientist <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> and German mathematician <a href="Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a> in the 1660s, led to the development of many infinite series for approximating . Newton himself used an arcsin series to compute a 15 digit approximation of in 1665 or 1666, later writing "I am ashamed to tell you to how many figures I carried these computations, having no other business at the time."

In Europe, Madhava's formula was rediscovered by Scottish mathematician <a href="James%20Gregory%20%28mathematician%29">James Gregory</a> in 1671, and by Leibniz in 1674:

This formula, the Gregory–Leibniz series, equals when evaluated with  = 1. In 1699, English mathematician <a href="Abraham%20Sharp">Abraham Sharp</a> used the Gregory–Leibniz series for formula_13 to compute to 71 digits, breaking the previous record of 39 digits, which was set with a polygonal algorithm. The Gregory–Leibniz for formula_14 series is simple, but <a href="Convergent%20series">converges</a> very slowly (that is, approaches the answer gradually), so it is not used in modern calculations.

In 1706 <a href="John%20Machin">John Machin</a> used the Gregory–Leibniz series to produce an algorithm that converged much faster:
Machin reached 100 digits of with this formula. Other mathematicians created variants, now known as <a href="Machin-like%20formula">Machin-like formula</a>e, that were used to set several successive records for calculating digits of . Machin-like formulae remained the best-known method for calculating well into the age of computers, and were used to set records for 250 years, culminating in a 620-digit approximation in 1946 by Daniel Ferguson – the best approximation achieved without the aid of a calculating device.

A record was set by the calculating prodigy <a href="Zacharias%20Dase">Zacharias Dase</a>, who in 1844 employed a Machin-like formula to calculate 200 decimals of in his head at the behest of German mathematician <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>. British mathematician <a href="William%20Shanks">William Shanks</a> famously took 15 years to calculate to 707 digits, but made a mistake in the 528th digit, rendering all subsequent digits incorrect.

Some infinite series for <a href="convergent%20series">converge</a> faster than others. Given the choice of two infinite series for , mathematicians will generally use the one that converges more rapidly because faster convergence reduces the amount of computation needed to calculate to any given accuracy. A simple infinite series for is the <a href="Leibniz%20formula%20for%20%CF%80">Gregory–Leibniz series</a>:
As individual terms of this infinite series are added to the sum, the total gradually gets closer to , and – with a sufficient number of terms – can get as close to as desired. It converges quite slowly, though – after 500,000 terms, it produces only five correct decimal digits of .

An infinite series for (published by Nilakantha in the 15th century) that converges more rapidly than the Gregory–Leibniz series is:

The following table compares the convergence rates of these two series:

After five terms, the sum of the Gregory–Leibniz series is within 0.2 of the correct value of , whereas the sum of Nilakantha's series is within 0.002 of the correct value of . Nilakantha's series converges faster and is more useful for computing digits of . Series that converge even faster include <a href="Machin-like%20formula">Machin's series</a> and <a href="Chudnovsky%20algorithm">Chudnovsky's series</a>, the latter producing 14 correct decimal digits per term.

Not all mathematical advances relating to were aimed at increasing the accuracy of approximations. When Euler solved the <a href="Basel%20problem">Basel problem</a> in 1735, finding the exact value of the sum of the reciprocal squares, he established a connection between and the <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s that later contributed to the development and study of the <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function">Riemann zeta function</a>:

Swiss scientist <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Lambert">Johann Heinrich Lambert</a> in 1761 proved that is <a href="irrational%20number">irrational</a>, meaning it is not equal to the quotient of any two whole numbers. <a href="Proof%20that%20%CF%80%20is%20irrational">Lambert's proof</a> exploited a continued-fraction representation of the tangent function. French mathematician <a href="Adrien-Marie%20Legendre">Adrien-Marie Legendre</a> proved in 1794 that is also irrational. In 1882, German mathematician <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Lindemann">Ferdinand von Lindemann</a> proved that is <a href="transcendental%20number">transcendental</a>, confirming a conjecture made by both <a href="Adrien-Marie%20Legendre">Legendre</a> and Euler. Hardy and Wright states that "the proofs were afterwards modified and simplified by Hilbert, Hurwitz, and other writers".

In the earliest usages, the <a href="Pi%20%28letter%29">Greek letter</a> was an abbreviation of the Greek word for <a href="Circumference">periphery</a> (περιφέρεια), and was combined in ratios with <a href="Delta%20%28letter%29">δ</a> (for <a href="diameter">diameter</a>) or <a href="Rho">ρ</a> (for <a href="radius">radius</a>) to form circle constants. (Before then, mathematicians sometimes used letters such as "c" or "p" instead.) The first recorded use is <a href="William%20Oughtred">Oughtred's</a> "formula_19", to express the ratio of periphery and diameter in the 1647 and later editions of "Clavis Mathematicae". <a href="Isaac%20Barrow">Barrow</a> likewise used "formula_20" to represent the constant 3.14..., while <a href="David%20Gregory%20%28mathematician%29">Gregory</a> instead used "formula_21" to represent 6.28... .

The earliest known use of the Greek letter alone to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by Welsh mathematician <a href="William%20Jones%20%28mathematician%29">William Jones</a> in his 1706 work "Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos; or, a New Introduction to the Mathematics". The Greek letter first appears there in the phrase "1/2 Periphery ()" in the discussion of a circle with radius one. However, he writes that his equations for are from the "ready pen of the truly ingenious Mr. <a href="John%20Machin">John Machin</a>", leading to speculation that Machin may have employed the Greek letter before Jones. Jones' notation was not immediately adopted by other mathematicians, with the fraction notation still being used as late as 1767.

<a href="Euler">Euler</a> started using the single-letter form beginning with his 1727 "Essay Explaining The Properties Of Air", though he used , the ratio of radius to periphery, in this and some later writing. Euler first used in his 1736 work "<a href="Mechanica">Mechanica</a>", and continued in his widely-read 1748 work "<a href="Introductio%20in%20analysin%20infinitorum">Introductio in analysin infinitorum</a>" (he wrote: "for the sake of brevity we will write this number as ; thus is equal to half the circumference of a circle of radius 1"). Because Euler corresponded heavily with other mathematicians in Europe, the use of the Greek letter spread rapidly, and the practice was universally adopted thereafter in the <a href="Western%20world">Western world</a>, though the definition still varied between 3.14... and 6.28... as late as 1761.

The development of computers in the mid-20th century again revolutionized the hunt for digits of . Mathematicians <a href="John%20Wrench">John Wrench</a> and Levi Smith reached 1,120 digits in 1949 using a desk calculator. Using an <a href="inverse%20tangent">inverse tangent</a> (arctan) infinite series, a team led by George Reitwiesner and <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a> that same year achieved 2,037 digits with a calculation that took 70 hours of computer time on the <a href="ENIAC">ENIAC</a> computer. The record, always relying on an arctan series, was broken repeatedly (7,480 digits in 1957; 10,000 digits in 1958; 100,000 digits in 1961) until 1 million digits were reached in 1973.

Two additional developments around 1980 once again accelerated the ability to compute . First, the discovery of new <a href="iterative%20algorithm">iterative algorithm</a>s for computing , which were much faster than the infinite series; and second, the invention of <a href="Multiplication%20algorithm%23Fast%20multiplication%20algorithms%20for%20large%20inputs">fast multiplication algorithms</a> that could multiply large numbers very rapidly. Such algorithms are particularly important in modern computations because most of the computer's time is devoted to multiplication. They include the <a href="Karatsuba%20algorithm">Karatsuba algorithm</a>, <a href="Toom%E2%80%93Cook%20multiplication">Toom–Cook multiplication</a>, and <a href="FFT%20multiplication%23Fourier%20transform%20methods">Fourier transform-based methods</a>.

The iterative algorithms were independently published in 1975–1976 by physicist <a href="Eugene%20Salamin%20%28mathematician%29">Eugene Salamin</a> and scientist <a href="Richard%20Brent%20%28scientist%29">Richard Brent</a>. These avoid reliance on infinite series. An iterative algorithm repeats a specific calculation, each iteration using the outputs from prior steps as its inputs, and produces a result in each step that converges to the desired value. The approach was actually invented over 160 years earlier by <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>, in what is now termed the <a href="AGM%20method">arithmetic–geometric mean method</a> (AGM method) or <a href="Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre%20algorithm">Gauss–Legendre algorithm</a>. As modified by Salamin and Brent, it is also referred to as the Brent–Salamin algorithm.

The iterative algorithms were widely used after 1980 because they are faster than infinite series algorithms: whereas infinite series typically increase the number of correct digits additively in successive terms, iterative algorithms generally "multiply" the number of correct digits at each step. For example, the Brent-Salamin algorithm doubles the number of digits in each iteration. In 1984, brothers <a href="Jonathan%20Borwein">John</a> and <a href="Peter%20Borwein">Peter Borwein</a> produced an iterative algorithm that quadruples the number of digits in each step; and in 1987, one that increases the number of digits five times in each step. Iterative methods were used by Japanese mathematician <a href="Yasumasa%20Kanada">Yasumasa Kanada</a> to set several records for computing between 1995 and 2002. This rapid convergence comes at a price: the iterative algorithms require significantly more memory than infinite series.

For most numerical calculations involving , a handful of digits provide sufficient precision. According to Jörg Arndt and Christoph Haenel, thirty-nine digits are sufficient to perform most <a href="cosmological">cosmological</a> calculations, because that is the accuracy necessary to calculate the circumference of the <a href="observable%20universe">observable universe</a> with a precision of one atom. Accounting for additional digits needed to compensate for computational <a href="round-off%20error">round-off error</a>s, Arndt concludes that a few hundred digits would suffice for any scientific application. Despite this, people have worked strenuously to compute to thousands and millions of digits. This effort may be partly ascribed to the human compulsion to break records, and such achievements with often make headlines around the world. They also have practical benefits, such as testing <a href="supercomputer">supercomputer</a>s, testing numerical analysis algorithms (including <a href="Multiplication%20algorithm%23Fast%20multiplication%20algorithms%20for%20large%20inputs">high-precision multiplication algorithms</a>); and within pure mathematics itself, providing data for evaluating the randomness of the digits of .

Modern calculators do not use iterative algorithms exclusively. New infinite series were discovered in the 1980s and 1990s that are as fast as iterative algorithms, yet are simpler and less memory intensive. The fast iterative algorithms were anticipated in 1914, when the Indian mathematician <a href="Srinivasa%20Ramanujan">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a> published dozens of innovative new formulae for , remarkable for their elegance, mathematical depth, and rapid convergence. One of his formulae, based on <a href="modular%20equation">modular equation</a>s, is
This series converges much more rapidly than most arctan series, including Machin's formula. <a href="Bill%20Gosper">Bill Gosper</a> was the first to use it for advances in the calculation of , setting a record of 17 million digits in 1985. Ramanujan's formulae anticipated the modern algorithms developed by the Borwein brothers and the <a href="Chudnovsky%20brothers">Chudnovsky brothers</a>. The <a href="Chudnovsky%20algorithm">Chudnovsky formula</a> developed in 1987 is
It produces about 14 digits of per term, and has been used for several record-setting calculations, including the first to surpass 1 billion (10) digits in 1989 by the Chudnovsky brothers, 2.7 trillion (2.7×10) digits by <a href="Fabrice%20Bellard">Fabrice Bellard</a> in 2009, 10 trillion (10) digits in 2011 by Alexander Yee and Shigeru Kondo, and over 22 trillion digits in 2016 by Peter Trueb. For similar formulas, see also the <a href="Ramanujan%E2%80%93Sato%20series">Ramanujan–Sato series</a>.

In 2006, mathematician <a href="Simon%20Plouffe">Simon Plouffe</a> used the PSLQ <a href="integer%20relation%20algorithm">integer relation algorithm</a> to generate several new formulas for , conforming to the following template:
where is <a href="Gelfond%27s%20constant"></a> (Gelfond's constant), is an <a href="odd%20number">odd number</a>, and are certain rational numbers that Plouffe computed.

<a href="Monte%20Carlo%20methods">Monte Carlo methods</a>, which evaluate the results of multiple random trials, can be used to create approximations of . <a href="Buffon%27s%20needle">Buffon's needle</a> is one such technique: If a needle of length is dropped times on a surface on which parallel lines are drawn units apart, and if of those times it comes to rest crossing a line ( > 0), then one may approximate based on the counts:

Another Monte Carlo method for computing is to draw a circle inscribed in a square, and randomly place dots in the square. The ratio of dots inside the circle to the total number of dots will approximately equal .
Another way to calculate using probability is to start with a <a href="random%20walk">random walk</a>, generated by a sequence of (fair) coin tosses: independent <a href="random%20variable">random variable</a>s such that with equal probabilities. The associated random walk is
so that, for each , is drawn from a shifted and scaled <a href="binomial%20distribution">binomial distribution</a>. As varies, defines a (discrete) <a href="stochastic%20process">stochastic process</a>. Then can be calculated by
This Monte Carlo method is independent of any relation to circles, and is a consequence of the <a href="central%20limit%20theorem">central limit theorem</a>, discussed <a href="%23Gaussian%20integrals">below</a>.

These Monte Carlo methods for approximating are very slow compared to other methods, and do not provide any information on the exact number of digits that are obtained. Thus they are never used to approximate when speed or accuracy is desired.

Two algorithms were discovered in 1995 that opened up new avenues of research into . They are called <a href="spigot%20algorithm">spigot algorithm</a>s because, like water dripping from a <a href="Tap%20%28valve%29">spigot</a>, they produce single digits of that are not reused after they are calculated. This is in contrast to infinite series or iterative algorithms, which retain and use all intermediate digits until the final result is produced.

Mathematicians <a href="Stan%20Wagon">Stan Wagon</a> and Stanley Rabinowitz produced a simple spigot algorithm in 1995. Its speed is comparable to arctan algorithms, but not as fast as iterative algorithms.

Another spigot algorithm, the <a href="Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe%20formula">BBP</a> <a href="digit%20extraction%20algorithm">digit extraction algorithm</a>, was discovered in 1995 by Simon Plouffe:
This formula, unlike others before it, can produce any individual <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> digit of without calculating all the preceding digits. Individual binary digits may be extracted from individual hexadecimal digits, and <a href="octal">octal</a> digits can be extracted from one or two hexadecimal digits. Variations of the algorithm have been discovered, but no digit extraction algorithm has yet been found that rapidly produces decimal digits. An important application of digit extraction algorithms is to validate new claims of record computations: After a new record is claimed, the decimal result is converted to hexadecimal, and then a digit extraction algorithm is used to calculate several random hexadecimal digits near the end; if they match, this provides a measure of confidence that the entire computation is correct.

Between 1998 and 2000, the <a href="distributed%20computing">distributed computing</a> project <a href="PiHex">PiHex</a> used <a href="Bellard%27s%20formula">Bellard's formula</a> (a modification of the BBP algorithm) to compute the quadrillionth (10th) bit of , which turned out to be 0. In September 2010, a <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a> employee used the company's <a href="Apache%20Hadoop">Hadoop</a> application on one thousand computers over a 23-day period to compute 256 <a href="bit">bit</a>s of at the two-quadrillionth (2×10th) bit, which also happens to be zero.

Because is closely related to the circle, it is found in <a href="List%20of%20formulae%20involving%20%CF%80">many formulae</a> from the fields of geometry and trigonometry, particularly those concerning circles, spheres, or ellipses. Other branches of science, such as statistics, physics, <a href="Fourier%20analysis">Fourier analysis</a>, and number theory, also include in some of their important formulae.

 appears in formulae for areas and volumes of geometrical shapes based on circles, such as <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a>s, <a href="sphere">sphere</a>s, <a href="cone%20%28geometry%29">cones</a>, and <a href="torus">tori</a>. Below are some of the more common formulae that involve .

The formulae above are special cases of the volume of the <a href="N-ball">"n"-dimensional ball</a> and the surface area of its boundary, the <a href="n-sphere">("n"−1)-dimensional sphere</a>, given <a href="%23Gamma%20function%20and%20Stirling%27s%20approximation">below</a>.

<a href="integral">Definite integrals</a> that describe circumference, area, or volume of shapes generated by circles typically have values that involve . For example, an integral that specifies half the area of a circle of radius one is given by:

In that integral the function represents the top half of a circle (the <a href="square%20root">square root</a> is a consequence of the <a href="Pythagorean%20theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a>), and the integral computes the area between that half of a circle and the <a href="X%20axis">axis</a>.

The <a href="trigonometric%20function">trigonometric function</a>s rely on angles, and mathematicians generally use radians as units of measurement. plays an important role in angles measured in <a href="radian">radian</a>s, which are defined so that a complete circle spans an angle of 2 radians. The angle measure of 180° is equal to radians, and 1° = /180 radians.

Common trigonometric functions have periods that are multiples of ; for example, sine and cosine have period 2, so for any angle and any integer ,

Many of the appearances of in the formulas of mathematics and the sciences have to do with its close relationship with geometry. However, also appears in many natural situations having apparently nothing to do with geometry.

In many applications, it plays a distinguished role as an <a href="eigenvalue">eigenvalue</a>. For example, an idealized <a href="vibrating%20string">vibrating string</a> can be modelled as the graph of a function on the unit interval , with <a href="boundary%20conditions">fixed ends</a> . The modes of vibration of the string are solutions of the <a href="differential%20equation">differential equation</a> . Here is an associated eigenvalue, which is constrained by <a href="Sturm%E2%80%93Liouville%20theory">Sturm–Liouville theory</a> to take on only certain specific values. It must be positive, since the second derivative is <a href="negative%20definite">negative definite</a>, so it is convenient to write where is called the <a href="wavenumber">wavenumber</a>. Then satisfies the boundary conditions and the differential equation with .

The value is, in fact, the "least" such value of the wavenumber, and is associated with the <a href="fundamental%20mode">fundamental mode</a> of vibration of the string. One way to obtain this is by estimating the <a href="energy">energy</a>. The energy satisfies an inequality, <a href="Wirtinger%27s%20inequality%20for%20functions">Wirtinger's inequality for functions</a>, which states that if a function is given such that and and are both <a href="square%20integrable">square integrable</a>, then the inequality holds:
and the case of equality holds precisely when is a multiple of . So appears as an optimal constant in Wirtinger's inequality, and from this it follows that it is the smallest such wavenumber, using the <a href="variational%20theorem">variational characterization</a> of the eigenvalue. As a consequence, is the smallest <a href="singular%20value">singular value</a> of the derivative on the space of functions on vanishing at both endpoints (the <a href="Sobolev%20space">Sobolev space</a> formula_32).

The number serves appears in similar eigenvalue problems in higher-dimensional analysis. As mentioned <a href="%23Definition">above</a>, it can be characterized via its role as the best constant in the <a href="isoperimetric%20inequality">isoperimetric inequality</a>: the area enclosed by a plane <a href="Jordan%20curve">Jordan curve</a> of perimeter satisfies the inequality
and equality is clearly achieved for the circle, since in that case and .

Ultimately as a consequence of the isoperimetric inequality, appears in the optimal constant for the critical <a href="Sobolev%20inequality">Sobolev inequality</a> in "n" dimensions, which thus characterizes the role of in many physical phenomena as well, for example those of classical <a href="potential%20theory">potential theory</a>. In two dimensions, the critical Sobolev inequality is
for "f" a smooth function with compact support in , formula_35 is the <a href="gradient">gradient</a> of "f", and formula_36 and formula_37 refer respectively to the <a href="Lp%20space">and -norm</a>. The Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the isoperimetric inequality (in any dimension), with the same best constants.

Wirtinger's inequality also generalizes to higher-dimensional <a href="Poincar%C3%A9%20inequality">Poincaré inequalities</a> that provide best constants for the <a href="Dirichlet%20energy">Dirichlet energy</a> of an "n"-dimensional membrane. Specifically, is the greatest constant such that
for all <a href="convex%20set">convex</a> subsets of of diameter 1, and square-integrable functions "u" on of mean zero. Just as Wirtinger's inequality is the <a href="calculus%20of%20variations">variational</a> form of the <a href="Dirichlet%20eigenvalue">Dirichlet eigenvalue</a> problem in one dimension, the Poincaré inequality is the variational form of the <a href="Neumann%20problem">Neumann</a> eigenvalue problem, in any dimension.

The constant also appears as a critical spectral parameter in the <a href="Fourier%20transform">Fourier transform</a>. This is the <a href="integral%20transform">integral transform</a>, that takes a complex-valued integrable function on the real line to the function defined as:
There are several different conventions for the Fourier transform, all of which involve a factor of that is placed "somewhere". The appearance of is essential in these formulas, as there is there is no possibility to remove altogether from the Fourier transform and its inverse transform. The definition given above is the most canonical, however, because it describes the unique unitary operator on that is also an algebra homomorphism of to .

The <a href="Heisenberg%20uncertainty%20principle">Heisenberg uncertainty principle</a> also contains the number . The uncertainty principle gives a sharp lower bound on the extent to which it is possible to localize a function both in space and in frequency: with our conventions for the Fourier transform,
The physical consequence, about the uncertainty in simultaneous position and momentum observations of a <a href="quantum%20mechanical">quantum mechanical</a> system, is <a href="%23Describing%20physical%20phenomena">discussed below</a>. The appearance of in the formulae of Fourier analysis is ultimately a consequence of the <a href="Stone%E2%80%93von%20Neumann%20theorem">Stone–von Neumann theorem</a>, asserting the uniqueness of the <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20representation">Schrödinger representation</a> of the <a href="Heisenberg%20group">Heisenberg group</a>.

The fields of <a href="probability">probability</a> and <a href="statistics">statistics</a> frequently use the <a href="normal%20distribution">normal distribution</a> as a simple model for complex phenomena; for example, scientists generally assume that the observational error in most experiments follows a normal distribution. The <a href="Gaussian%20function">Gaussian function</a>, which is the <a href="probability%20density%20function">probability density function</a> of the normal distribution with <a href="mean">mean</a> and <a href="standard%20deviation">standard deviation</a> , naturally contains :

For this to be a probability density, the area under the graph of needs to be equal to one. This follows from a <a href="integration%20by%20substitution">change of variables</a> in the <a href="Gaussian%20integral">Gaussian integral</a>:

which says that the area under the basic <a href="bell%20curve">bell curve</a> in the figure is equal to the square root of .
The <a href="central%20limit%20theorem">central limit theorem</a> explains the central role of normal distributions, and thus of , in probability and statistics. This theorem is ultimately connected with the <a href="%23Fourier%20transform%20and%20Heisenberg%20uncertainty%20principle">spectral characterization</a> of as the eigenvalue associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and the fact that equality holds in the uncertainty principle only for the Gaussian function. Equivalently, is the unique constant making the Gaussian normal distribution equal to its own Fourier transform. Indeed, according to , the "whole business" of establishing the fundamental theorems of Fourier analysis reduces to the Gaussian integral.

Let be the set of all twice differentiable real functions formula_43 that satisfy the <a href="ordinary%20differential%20equation">ordinary differential equation</a> formula_44. Then is a two-dimensional real <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a>, with two parameters corresponding to a pair of <a href="initial%20conditions">initial conditions</a> for the differential equation. For any formula_45, let formula_46 be the evaluation functional, which associates to each formula_47 the value formula_48 of the function at the real point . Then, for each "t", the <a href="kernel%20of%20a%20linear%20transformation">kernel</a> of formula_49 is a one-dimensional linear subspace of . Hence formula_50 defines a function from formula_51 from the real line to the <a href="real%20projective%20line">real projective line</a>. This function is periodic, and the quantity can be characterized as the period of this map.

The constant appears in the <a href="Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet%20formula">Gauss–Bonnet formula</a> which relates the <a href="differential%20geometry%20of%20surfaces">differential geometry of surfaces</a> to their <a href="topology">topology</a>. Specifically, if a <a href="compact%20space">compact</a> surface has <a href="Gauss%20curvature">Gauss curvature</a> "K", then
where is the <a href="Euler%20characteristic">Euler characteristic</a>, which is an integer. An example is the surface area of a sphere "S" of curvature 1 (so that its <a href="radius%20of%20curvature">radius of curvature</a>, which coincides with its radius, is also 1.) The Euler characteristic of a sphere can be computed from its <a href="homology%20group">homology group</a>s and is found to be equal to two. Thus we have
reproducing the formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius 1.

The constant appears in many other integral formulae in topology, in particular, those involving <a href="characteristic%20class">characteristic class</a>es via the <a href="Chern%E2%80%93Weil%20homomorphism">Chern–Weil homomorphism</a>.

<a href="Vector%20calculus">Vector calculus</a> is a branch of calculus that is concerned with the properties of <a href="vector%20field">vector field</a>s, and has many physical applications such as to <a href="electricity%20and%20magnetism">electricity and magnetism</a>. The <a href="Newtonian%20potential">Newtonian potential</a> for a point source situated at the origin of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is
which represents the <a href="potential%20energy">potential energy</a> of a unit mass (or charge) placed a distance from the source, and is a dimensional constant. The field, denoted here by , which may be the (Newtonian) <a href="gravitational%20field">gravitational field</a> or the (Coulomb) <a href="electric%20field">electric field</a>, is the negative <a href="gradient">gradient</a> of the potential:
Special cases include <a href="Coulomb%27s%20law">Coulomb's law</a> and <a href="Newton%27s%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation">Newton's law of universal gravitation</a>. <a href="Gauss%27%20law">Gauss' law</a> states that the outward <a href="flux">flux</a> of the field through any smooth, simple, closed, orientable surface containing the origin is equal to :

It is standard to absorb this factor of into the constant , but this argument shows why it must appear "somewhere". Furthermore, is the surface area of the unit sphere, but we have not assumed that is the sphere. However, as a consequence of the <a href="divergence%20theorem">divergence theorem</a>, because the region away from the origin is vacuum (source-free) it is only the <a href="homology%20class">homology class</a> of the surface in that matters in computing the integral, so it can be replaced by any convenient surface in the same homology class, in particular, a sphere, where spherical coordinates can be used to calculate the integral.

A consequence of the Gauss law is that the negative <a href="Laplacian">Laplacian</a> of the potential is equal to times the <a href="Dirac%20delta%20function">Dirac delta function</a>:
More general distributions of matter (or charge) are obtained from this by <a href="convolution">convolution</a>, giving the <a href="Poisson%20equation">Poisson equation</a>
where is the distribution function.
The constant also plays an analogous role in four-dimensional potentials associated with <a href="Einstein%27s%20equations">Einstein's equations</a>, a fundamental formula which forms the basis of the <a href="general%20theory%20of%20relativity">general theory of relativity</a> and describes the <a href="fundamental%20interaction">fundamental interaction</a> of <a href="gravitation">gravitation</a> as a result of <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> being <a href="curvature">curved</a> by <a href="matter">matter</a> and <a href="energy">energy</a>:
where is the <a href="Ricci%20curvature%20tensor">Ricci curvature tensor</a>, is the <a href="scalar%20curvature">scalar curvature</a>, is the <a href="metric%20tensor%20%28general%20relativity%29">metric tensor</a>, is the <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a>, is <a href="gravitational%20constant">Newton's gravitational constant</a>, is the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> in vacuum, and is the <a href="stress%E2%80%93energy%20tensor">stress–energy tensor</a>. The left-hand side of Einstein's equation is a non-linear analog of the Laplacian of the metric tensor, and reduces to that in the weak field limit, with the formula_59 term playing the role of a <a href="Lagrange%20multiplier">Lagrange multiplier</a>, and the right-hand side is the analog of the distribution function, times .

One of the key tools in <a href="complex%20analysis">complex analysis</a> is <a href="contour%20integration">contour integration</a> of a function over a positively oriented (<a href="rectifiable%20curve">rectifiable</a>) <a href="Jordan%20curve">Jordan curve</a> . A form of <a href="Cauchy%27s%20integral%20formula">Cauchy's integral formula</a> states that if a point is interior to , then

Although the curve is not a circle, and hence does not have any obvious connection to the constant , a standard proof of this result uses <a href="Morera%27s%20theorem">Morera's theorem</a>, which implies that the integral is invariant under <a href="homotopy">homotopy</a> of the curve, so that it can be deformed to a circle and then integrated explicitly in polar coordinates. More generally, it is true that if a rectifiable closed curve does not contain , then the above integral is times the <a href="winding%20number">winding number</a> of the curve.

The general form of Cauchy's integral formula establishes the relationship between the values of a <a href="complex%20analytic%20function">complex analytic function</a> on the Jordan curve and the value of at any interior point of :
provided is analytic in the region enclosed by and extends continuously to . Cauchy's integral formula is a special case of the <a href="residue%20theorem">residue theorem</a>, that if is a <a href="meromorphic%20function">meromorphic function</a> the region enclosed by and is continuous in a neighborhood of , then
where the sum is of the <a href="residue%20%28mathematics%29">residues</a> at the <a href="pole%20%28complex%20analysis%29">poles</a> of .

The factorial function is the product of all of the positive integers through . The <a href="gamma%20function">gamma function</a> extends the concept of <a href="factorial">factorial</a> (normally defined only for non-negative integers) to all complex numbers, except the negative real integers. When the gamma function is evaluated at half-integers, the result contains ; for example formula_63 and formula_64.

The gamma function is defined by its <a href="Weierstrass%20product">Weierstrass product</a> development:
where is the <a href="Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni%20constant">Euler–Mascheroni constant</a>. Evaluated at and squared, the equation reduces to the Wallis product formula. The gamma function is also connected to the <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function">Riemann zeta function</a> and identities for the <a href="functional%20determinant">functional determinant</a>, in which the constant <a href="%23Number%20theory%20and%20Riemann%20zeta%20function">plays an important role</a>.

The gamma function is used to calculate the volume of the <a href="n-ball">"n"-dimensional ball</a> of radius "r" in Euclidean "n"-dimensional space, and the surface area of its boundary, the <a href="n-sphere">("n"−1)-dimensional sphere</a>:

Further, it follows from the <a href="functional%20equation">functional equation</a> that

The gamma function can be used to create a simple approximation to the factorial function for large : formula_69 which is known as <a href="Stirling%27s%20approximation">Stirling's approximation</a>. Equivalently,

As a geometrical application of Stirling's approximation, let denote the <a href="simplex">standard simplex</a> in "n"-dimensional Euclidean space, and denote the simplex having all of its sides scaled up by a factor of . Then

<a href="Ehrhart%27s%20volume%20conjecture">Ehrhart's volume conjecture</a> is that this is the (optimal) upper bound on the volume of a <a href="convex%20body">convex body</a> containing only one <a href="lattice%20point">lattice point</a>.

The <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function">Riemann zeta function</a> is used in many areas of mathematics. When evaluated at it can be written as
Finding a <a href="closed-form%20expression">simple solution</a> for this infinite series was a famous problem in mathematics called the <a href="Basel%20problem">Basel problem</a>. <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> solved it in 1735 when he showed it was equal to . Euler's result leads to the <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a> result that the probability of two random numbers being <a href="relatively%20prime">relatively prime</a> (that is, having no shared factors) is equal to . This probability is based on the observation that the probability that any number is <a href="divisible">divisible</a> by a prime is (for example, every 7th integer is divisible by 7.) Hence the probability that two numbers are both divisible by this prime is , and the probability that at least one of them is not is . For distinct primes, these divisibility events are mutually independent; so the probability that two numbers are relatively prime is given by a product over all primes:

This probability can be used in conjunction with a <a href="random%20number%20generator">random number generator</a> to approximate using a Monte Carlo approach.

The solution to the Basel problem implies that the geometrically derived quantity is connected in a deep way to the distribution of prime numbers. This is a special case of <a href="Weil%27s%20conjecture%20on%20Tamagawa%20numbers">Weil's conjecture on Tamagawa numbers</a>, which asserts the equality of similar such infinite products of "arithmetic" quantities, localized at each prime "p", and a "geometrical" quantity: the reciprocal of the volume of a certain <a href="locally%20symmetric%20space">locally symmetric space</a>. In the case of the Basel problem, it is the <a href="hyperbolic%203-manifold">hyperbolic 3-manifold</a> .

The zeta function also satisfies Riemann's functional equation, which involves as well as the gamma function:

Furthermore, the derivative of the zeta function satisfies
A consequence is that can be obtained from the <a href="functional%20determinant">functional determinant</a> of the <a href="harmonic%20oscillator">harmonic oscillator</a>. This functional determinant can be computed via a product expansion, and is equivalent to the Wallis product formula. The calculation can be recast in <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, specifically the <a href="Calculus%20of%20variations">variational approach</a> to the <a href="Bohr%20model">spectrum of the hydrogen atom</a>.

The constant also appears naturally in <a href="Fourier%20series">Fourier series</a> of <a href="periodic%20function">periodic function</a>s. Periodic functions are functions on the group of fractional parts of real numbers. The Fourier decomposition shows that a complex-valued function on can be written as an infinite linear superposition of <a href="unitary%20character">unitary character</a>s of . That is, continuous <a href="group%20homomorphism">group homomorphism</a>s from to the <a href="circle%20group">circle group</a> of unit modulus complex numbers. It is a theorem that every character of is one of the complex exponentials formula_76.

There is a unique character on , up to complex conjugation, that is a group isomorphism. Using the <a href="Haar%20measure">Haar measure</a> on the circle group, the constant is half the magnitude of the <a href="Radon%E2%80%93Nikodym%20derivative">Radon–Nikodym derivative</a> of this character. The other characters have derivatives whose magnitudes are positive integral multiples of 2. As a result, the constant is the unique number such that the group T, equipped with its Haar measure, is <a href="Pontrjagin%20dual">Pontrjagin dual</a> to the <a href="lattice%20%28group%29">lattice</a> of integral multiples of 2. This is a version of the one-dimensional <a href="Poisson%20summation%20formula">Poisson summation formula</a>.

The constant is connected in a deep way with the theory of <a href="modular%20form">modular form</a>s and <a href="theta%20function">theta function</a>s. For example, the <a href="Chudnovsky%20algorithm">Chudnovsky algorithm</a> involves in an essential way the <a href="j-invariant">j-invariant</a> of an <a href="elliptic%20curve">elliptic curve</a>.

<a href="Modular%20form">Modular form</a>s are <a href="holomorphic%20function">holomorphic function</a>s in the <a href="upper%20half%20plane">upper half plane</a> characterized by their transformation properties under the <a href="modular%20group">modular group</a> formula_77 (or its various subgroups), a lattice in the group formula_78. An example is the <a href="Jacobi%20theta%20function">Jacobi theta function</a>
which is a kind of modular form called a <a href="Jacobi%20form">Jacobi form</a>. This is sometimes written in terms of the <a href="nome%20%28mathematics%29">nome</a> formula_80.

The constant is the unique constant making the Jacobi theta function an <a href="automorphic%20form">automorphic form</a>, which means that it transforms in a specific way. Certain identities hold for all automorphic forms. An example is
which implies that transforms as a representation under the discrete <a href="Heisenberg%20group">Heisenberg group</a>. General modular forms and other <a href="theta%20function">theta function</a>s also involve , once again because of the <a href="Stone%E2%80%93von%20Neumann%20theorem">Stone–von Neumann theorem</a>.

The <a href="Cauchy%20distribution">Cauchy distribution</a>

is a <a href="probability%20density%20function">probability density function</a>. The total probability is equal to one, owing to the integral:

The <a href="Shannon%20entropy">Shannon entropy</a> of the Cauchy distribution is equal to , which also involves .
The Cauchy distribution plays an important role in <a href="potential%20theory">potential theory</a> because it is the simplest <a href="Furstenberg%20boundary">Furstenberg measure</a>, the classical <a href="Poisson%20kernel">Poisson kernel</a> associated with a <a href="Brownian%20motion">Brownian motion</a> in a half-plane. <a href="Conjugate%20harmonic%20function">Conjugate harmonic function</a>s and so also the <a href="Hilbert%20transform">Hilbert transform</a> are associated with the asymptotics of the Poisson kernel. The Hilbert transform "H" is the integral transform given by the <a href="Cauchy%20principal%20value">Cauchy principal value</a> of the <a href="singular%20integral">singular integral</a>

The constant is the unique (positive) normalizing factor such that "H" defines a <a href="linear%20complex%20structure">linear complex structure</a> on the Hilbert space of square-integrable real-valued functions on the real line. The Hilbert transform, like the Fourier transform, can be characterized purely in terms of its transformation properties on the Hilbert space : up to a normalization factor, it is the unique bounded linear operator that commutes with positive dilations and anti-commutes with all reflections of the real line. The constant is the unique normalizing factor that makes this transformation unitary.

An occurrence of in the <a href="Mandelbrot%20set">Mandelbrot set</a> <a href="fractal">fractal</a> was discovered by David Boll in 1991. He examined the behavior of the Mandelbrot set near the "neck" at . If points with coordinates are considered, as ε tends to zero, the number of iterations until divergence for the point multiplied by "ε" converges to . The point at the cusp of the large "valley" on the right side of the Mandelbrot set behaves similarly: the number of iterations until divergence multiplied by the square root of "ε" tends to .

Although not a <a href="physical%20constant">physical constant</a>, appears routinely in equations describing fundamental principles of the universe, often because of 's relationship to the circle and to <a href="spherical%20coordinate%20system">spherical coordinate system</a>s. A simple formula from the field of <a href="classical%20mechanics">classical mechanics</a> gives the approximate period of a simple <a href="pendulum">pendulum</a> of length , swinging with a small amplitude ( is the <a href="Gravity%20of%20Earth">earth's gravitational acceleration</a>):
One of the key formulae of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> is <a href="Heisenberg%27s%20uncertainty%20principle">Heisenberg's uncertainty principle</a>, which shows that the uncertainty in the measurement of a particle's position (Δ) and <a href="momentum">momentum</a> (Δ) cannot both be arbitrarily small at the same time (where is <a href="Planck%27s%20constant">Planck's constant</a>):

The fact that is approximately equal to 3 plays a role in the relatively long lifetime of <a href="orthopositronium">orthopositronium</a>. The inverse lifetime to lowest order in the <a href="fine-structure%20constant">fine-structure constant</a> is
where is the mass of the electron.

The field of <a href="fluid%20dynamics">fluid dynamics</a> contains in <a href="Stokes%27%20law">Stokes' law</a>, which approximates the <a href="drag%20force">frictional force</a> exerted on small, <a href="sphere">spherical</a> objects of radius , moving with velocity in a <a href="fluid">fluid</a> with <a href="dynamic%20viscosity">dynamic viscosity</a> :

In electromagnetics, the <a href="vacuum%20permeability">vacuum permeability</a> constant "μ" appears in <a href="Maxwell%27s%20equations">Maxwell's equations</a>, which describe the properties of <a href="Electric%20field">electric</a> and <a href="Magnetic%20field">magnetic</a> fields and <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a>. It is defined as exactly
A relation for the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> in vacuum, can be derived from Maxwell's equations in the medium of <a href="Vacuum%23In%20electromagnetism">classical vacuum</a> using a relationship between "μ" and the <a href="Vacuum%20permittivity">electric constant (vacuum permittivity)</a>, in SI units:

Under ideal conditions (uniform gentle slope on a homogeneously erodible substrate), the <a href="sinuosity">sinuosity</a> of a <a href="meander">meander</a>ing river approaches . The sinuosity is the ratio between the actual length and the straight-line distance from source to mouth. Faster currents along the outside edges of a river's bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges, thus pushing the bends even farther out, and increasing the overall loopiness of the river. However, that loopiness eventually causes the river to double back on itself in places and "short-circuit", creating an <a href="ox-bow%20lake">ox-bow lake</a> in the process. The balance between these two opposing factors leads to an average ratio of between the actual length and the direct distance between source and mouth.

<a href="Piphilology">Piphilology</a> is the practice of memorizing large numbers of digits of , and world-records are kept by the "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>". The record for memorizing digits of , certified by Guinness World Records, is 70,000 digits, recited in India by Rajveer Meena in 9 hours and 27 minutes on 21 March 2015. In 2006, <a href="Akira%20Haraguchi">Akira Haraguchi</a>, a retired Japanese engineer, claimed to have recited 100,000 decimal places, but the claim was not verified by Guinness World Records.

One common technique is to memorize a story or poem in which the word lengths represent the digits of : The first word has three letters, the second word has one, the third has four, the fourth has one, the fifth has five, and so on. An early example of a memorization aid, originally devised by English scientist <a href="James%20Hopwood%20Jeans">James Jeans</a>, is "How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics." When a poem is used, it is sometimes referred to as a "piem". Poems for memorizing have been composed in several languages in addition to English. Record-setting memorizers typically do not rely on poems, but instead use methods such as remembering number patterns and the <a href="method%20of%20loci">method of loci</a>.

A few authors have used the digits of to establish a new form of <a href="constrained%20writing">constrained writing</a>, where the word lengths are required to represent the digits of . The "<a href="Cadaeic%20Cadenza">Cadaeic Cadenza</a>" contains the first 3835 digits of in this manner, and the full-length book "Not a Wake" contains 10,000 words, each representing one digit of .

Perhaps because of the simplicity of its definition and its ubiquitous presence in formulae, has been represented in popular culture more than other mathematical constructs.

In the 2008 <a href="Open%20University">Open University</a> and <a href="BBC">BBC</a> documentary co-production, "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Maths">The Story of Maths</a>", aired in October 2008 on <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a>, British mathematician <a href="Marcus%20du%20Sautoy">Marcus du Sautoy</a> shows a <a href="Information%20graphics">visualization</a> of the – historically first exact – <a href="Madhava%20of%20Sangamagrama%23The%20value%20of%20%CF%80%20%28pi%29">formula for calculating</a> when visiting India and exploring its contributions to trigonometry.

In the <a href="Palais%20de%20la%20D%C3%A9couverte">Palais de la Découverte</a> (a science museum in Paris) there is a circular room known as the "pi room". On its wall are inscribed 707 digits of . The digits are large wooden characters attached to the dome-like ceiling. The digits were based on an 1853 calculation by English mathematician <a href="William%20Shanks">William Shanks</a>, which included an error beginning at the 528th digit. The error was detected in 1946 and corrected in 1949.

In <a href="Carl%20Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>'s novel "<a href="Contact%20%28novel%29">Contact</a>" it is suggested that the creator of the universe buried a message deep within the digits of . The digits of have also been incorporated into the lyrics of the song "Pi" from the album "<a href="Aerial%20%28album%29">Aerial</a>" by <a href="Kate%20Bush">Kate Bush</a>.

In the United States, <a href="Pi%20Day">Pi Day</a> falls on 14 March (written 3/14 in the US style), and is popular among students. and its digital representation are often used by self-described "math <a href="geek">geek</a>s" for <a href="inside%20joke">inside joke</a>s among mathematically and technologically minded groups. Several college <a href="cheering">cheers</a> at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> include "3.14159". Pi Day in 2015 was particularly significant because the date and time 3/14/15 9:26:53 reflected many more digits of pi. In parts of the world where dates are commonly noted in day/month/year format, July 22 represents "Pi Approximation Day," as 22/7=3.142857.

During the 2011 auction for <a href="Nortel">Nortel</a>'s portfolio of valuable technology patents, <a href="Google">Google</a> made a series of unusually specific bids based on mathematical and scientific constants, including .
In 1958 <a href="Albert%20Eagle">Albert Eagle</a> <a href="Turn%20%28geometry%29%23Tau%20proposal">proposed</a> replacing by (<a href="tau">tau</a>), where , to simplify formulas. However, no other authors are known to use in this way. Some people use a different value, , arguing that , as the number of radians in one <a href="Turn%20%28geometry%29">turn</a>, or as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius rather than its diameter, is more natural than and simplifies many formulas. Celebrations of this number, because it approximately equals 6.28, by making 28 June "Tau Day" and eating "twice the pie", have been reported in the media. However, this use of has not made its way into mainstream mathematics.

In 1897, an amateur mathematician attempted to persuade the <a href="Indiana%20General%20Assembly">Indiana legislature</a> to pass the <a href="Indiana%20Pi%20Bill">Indiana Pi Bill</a>, which described a method to <a href="Squaring%20the%20circle">square the circle</a> and contained text that implied various incorrect values for , including 3.2. The bill is notorious as an attempt to establish a value of scientific constant by legislative fiat. The bill was passed by the Indiana House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate, meaning it did not become a law.

In contemporary <a href="internet%20culture">internet culture</a>, individuals and organizations frequently pay homage to the number . For instance, the <a href="computer%20scientist">computer scientist</a> <a href="Donald%20Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> let the version numbers of his program <a href="TeX">TeX</a> approach . The versions are 3, 3.1, 3.14, and so forth.

Platypus

The platypus ("Ornithorhynchus anatinus"), sometimes referred to as the duck-billed platypus, is a <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> egg-laying <a href="mammal">mammal</a> <a href="Endemic%20%28ecology%29">endemic</a> to <a href="Eastern%20states%20of%20Australia">eastern Australia</a>, including <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. Together with the four species of <a href="echidna">echidna</a>, it is one of the five <a href="wikt%3Aextant">extant</a> species of <a href="monotreme">monotreme</a>s, the only mammals that lay <a href="Egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a> instead of giving birth to live young. The animal is the sole living representative of its <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> (<a href="Ornithorhynchidae">Ornithorhynchidae</a>) and <a href="genus">genus</a> ("Ornithorhynchus"), though a number of <a href="Fossil%20Monotremes">related species</a> appear in the fossil record. The first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body (in 1799) judged it a fake, made of several animals sewn together.

The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, <a href="duck">duck</a>-billed, <a href="beaver">beaver</a>-tailed, <a href="otter">otter</a>-footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it, with some considering it an elaborate hoax. It is one of the few species of <a href="venomous%20mammals">venomous mammals</a>: the male platypus has a <a href="spur%20%28zoology%29">spur</a> on the hind foot that delivers a <a href="Platypus_venom">venom</a> capable of causing severe pain to humans. The unique features of the platypus make it an important subject in the study of <a href="evolutionary%20biology">evolutionary biology</a> and a recognizable and iconic symbol of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>; it has appeared as a mascot at national events and features on the <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a> of the <a href="Australian%20twenty-cent%20coin">Australian twenty-cent coin</a>. The platypus is the animal emblem of the state of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>.

Until the early 20th century humans hunted the platypus for its fur, but it is now protected throughout its range. Although <a href="captive%20breeding">captive-breeding</a> programs have had only limited success, and the platypus is vulnerable to the effects of pollution, it is not under any immediate threat.

When the platypus was first encountered by Europeans in 1798, a <a href="Pelage">pelt</a> and sketch were sent back to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> by <a href="John%20Hunter%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Captain John Hunter</a>, the second Governor of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. British scientists' initial hunch was that the attributes were a hoax. <a href="George%20Shaw">George Shaw</a>, who produced the first description of the animal in the "Naturalist's Miscellany" in 1799, stated it was impossible not to entertain doubts as to its genuine nature, and <a href="Robert%20Knox">Robert Knox</a> believed it might have been produced by some Asian <a href="Taxidermy">taxidermist</a>. It was thought that somebody had sewn a duck's beak onto the body of a beaver-like animal. Shaw even took a pair of scissors to the dried skin to check for stitches.

The common name "platypus" is the <a href="Latinisation%20%28literature%29">latinisation</a> of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> word ('), "flat-footed", from ('), "broad, wide, flat" and (""), "foot". Shaw assigned the species the <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy">Linnaean</a> name "Platypus anatinus" when he initially described it, but the genus term was quickly discovered to already be in use as the name of the wood-boring <a href="ambrosia%20beetle">ambrosia beetle</a> genus "<a href="Platypus%20%28weevil%29">Platypus</a>". It was independently described as "Ornithorhynchus paradoxus" by <a href="Johann%20Blumenbach">Johann Blumenbach</a> in 1800 (from a specimen given to him by <a href="Sir%20Joseph%20Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a>) and following the <a href="principle%20of%20priority">rules of priority</a> of nomenclature, it was later officially recognised as "Ornithorhynchus anatinus".
The scientific name "Ornithorhynchus anatinus" is derived from (""), which literally means "bird snout" in Greek; and "anatinus", which means "duck-like" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>.

There is no universally-agreed plural form of "platypus" in the English language. Scientists generally use "platypuses" or simply "platypus". Colloquially, the term "platypi" is also used for the plural, although this is technically incorrect and a form of <a href="Dog%20Latin">pseudo-Latin</a>; the correct Greek plural would be "platypodes". Early <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="settler">settler</a>s called it by many names, such as "watermole", "duckbill", and "duckmole". The name "platypus" is occasionally prefixed with the adjective "duck-billed" to form "duck-billed platypus".

In <a href="David%20Collins%20%28lieutenant%20governor%29">David Collins</a>'s account of the new colony 1788–1801, he describes coming across as "an amphibious animal, of the mole species". His account includes a drawing of the animal.

The body and the broad, flat tail of the platypus are covered with dense, brown <a href="fur">fur</a> that traps a layer of insulating air to keep the animal warm. The fur is waterproof, and the texture is akin to that of a <a href="Mole%20%28animal%29">mole</a>. The platypus uses its tail for storage of fat reserves (an adaptation also found in animals such as the <a href="Tasmanian%20devil">Tasmanian devil</a>). The <a href="webbed%20foot">webbing on the feet</a> is more significant on the front feet and is folded back when walking on land. The elongated snout and lower jaw are covered in soft skin, forming the bill. The nostrils are located on the dorsal surface of the snout, while the eyes and ears are located in a groove set just back from it; this groove is closed when swimming. Platypuses have been heard to emit a low growl when disturbed and a range of other vocalisations have been reported in captive specimens.

Weight varies considerably from , with males being larger than females; males average in total length, while females average , with substantial variation in average size from one region to another, and this pattern does not seem to follow any particular climatic rule and may be due to other environmental factors, such as predation and human encroachment.

The platypus has an average <a href="Core%20temperature">body temperature</a> of about rather than the typical of <a href="placentalia">placental mammals</a>. Research suggests this has been a gradual adaptation to harsh environmental conditions on the part of the small number of surviving monotreme species rather than a historical characteristic of monotremes.

Modern platypus young have three teeth in each of the <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>e (one premolar and two <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>) and <a href="Mandible">dentaries</a> (three molars), which they lose before or just after leaving the breeding burrow; adults have heavily <a href="keratinisation">keratinised</a> pads in their place. The first upper and third lower cheek teeth of platypus nestlings are small, each having one principal cusp, while the other teeth have two main cusps. The platypus <a href="jaw">jaw</a> is constructed differently from that of other mammals, and the jaw-opening muscle is different. As in all true mammals, the tiny bones that conduct sound in the <a href="middle%20ear">middle ear</a> are fully incorporated into the skull, rather than lying in the jaw as in <a href="cynodont">cynodont</a>s and other premammalian <a href="synapsid">synapsid</a>s. However, the external opening of the ear still lies at the base of the jaw. The platypus has extra bones in the shoulder girdle, including an <a href="interclavicle">interclavicle</a>, which is not found in other mammals. As in many other aquatic and semiaquatic <a href="vertebrates">vertebrates</a>, the bones show <a href="osteosclerosis">osteosclerosis</a>, increasing their density to provide ballast. It has a <a href="Reptile">reptilian</a> gait, with the legs on the sides of the body, rather than underneath. When on land, it engages in <a href="knuckle-walking">knuckle-walking</a> on its front feet, to protect the webbing between the toes.

While both male and female platypuses are born with ankle spurs, only the male's spurs deliver venom,
composed largely of <a href="defensin">defensin</a>-like <a href="protein">protein</a>s (DLPs), three of which are unique to the platypus. The DLPs are produced by the immune system of the platypus. The function of defensins is to cause <a href="lysis">lysis</a> in pathogenic bacteria and viruses, but in platypuses they also are formed into venom for defense. Although powerful enough to kill smaller animals such as dogs, the venom is not lethal to humans, but the pain is so excruciating that the victim may be incapacitated. <a href="Edema">Oedema</a> rapidly develops around the wound and gradually spreads throughout the affected limb. Information obtained from <a href="Case%20study">case histories</a> and anecdotal evidence indicates the pain develops into a long-lasting <a href="hyperalgesia">hyperalgesia</a> (a heightened sensitivity to pain) that persists for days or even months. Venom is produced in the <a href="wikt%3Acrural">crural</a> glands of the male, which are kidney-shaped <a href="alveolar%20gland">alveolar gland</a>s connected by a thin-walled duct to a <a href="calcaneus">calcaneus</a> spur on each hind limb. The female platypus, in common with echidnas, has rudimentary spur buds that do not develop (dropping off before the end of their first year) and lack functional crural glands.

The venom appears to have a different function from those produced by nonmammalian species; its effects are not life-threatening to humans, but nevertheless powerful enough to seriously impair the victim. Since only males produce venom and production rises during the breeding season, it may be used as an offensive weapon to assert dominance during this period.

Similar spurs are found on many archaic mammal groups, indicating that this is an ancient characteristic for mammals as a whole, and not exclusive to the platypus or other monotremes.

<a href="Monotremes">Monotremes</a> (for the other species, see <a href="Echidna">Echidna</a>) are the only mammals (apart from at least one species of <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>) known to have a sense of <a href="electroreception">electroreception</a>: they locate their prey in part by detecting electric fields generated by muscular contractions. The platypus's electroreception is the most sensitive of any monotreme.

The <a href="electroreceptor">electroreceptor</a>s are located in rostrocaudal rows in the skin of the bill, while <a href="mechanoreceptor">mechanoreceptor</a>s (which detect touch) are uniformly distributed across the bill. The electrosensory area of the <a href="cerebral%20cortex">cerebral cortex</a> is contained within the tactile <a href="somatosensory">somatosensory</a> area, and some cortical cells receive input from both electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors, suggesting a close association between the tactile and electric senses. Both electroreceptors and mechanoreceptors in the bill dominate the <a href="somatotopic%20map">somatotopic map</a> of the platypus brain, in the same way human hands dominate the <a href="Cortical%20homunculus">Penfield homunculus map</a>.

The platypus can determine the direction of an electric source, perhaps by comparing differences in <a href="signal%20strength">signal strength</a> across the sheet of electroreceptors. This would explain the characteristic side-to-side motion of the animal's head while hunting, seen also in the <a href="Hammerhead%20shark">Hammerhead shark</a> while foraging. The cortical convergence of electrosensory and tactile inputs suggests a mechanism that determines the distance of prey that, when they move, emit both electrical signals and mechanical pressure pulses. The platypus uses the difference between arrival times of the two signals to sense distance.

Feeding by neither sight nor smell, the platypus closes its eyes, ears, and nose each time it dives. Rather, when it digs in the bottom of streams with its bill, its electroreceptors detect tiny electric currents generated by muscular contractions of its prey, so enabling it to distinguish between animate and inanimate objects, which continuously stimulate its mechanoreceptors. Experiments have shown the platypus will even react to an "artificial shrimp" if a small electric current is passed through it.

Monotreme electrolocation probably evolved in order to allow the animals to forage in murky waters, and may be tied to their tooth loss. The extinct "<a href="Obdurodon">Obdurodon</a>" was electroreceptive, but unlike the modern platypus it foraged pelagically (near the ocean surface).

In recent studies it has been suggested that the eyes of the platypus are more similar to those of <a href="Pacific%20hagfish">Pacific hagfish</a> or Northern Hemisphere <a href="lamprey">lamprey</a>s than to those of most tetrapods. The eyes also contain <a href="Double%20cone%20%28biology%29">double cones</a>, which most mammals do not have.

Although the platypus's eyes are small and not used under water, several features indicate that vision played an important role in its ancestors. The <a href="cornea">cornea</a>l surface and the adjacent surface of the lens is flat while the posterior surface of the lens is steeply curved, similar to the eyes of other aquatic mammals such as otters and sea-lions. A <a href="Temporal%20bone">temporal</a> (ear side) concentration of <a href="retinal%20ganglion%20cell">retinal ganglion cell</a>s, important for binocular vision, indicates a role in <a href="predation">predation</a>, while the accompanying visual acuity is insufficient for such activities. Furthermore, this limited acuity is matched by a low <a href="cortical%20magnification">cortical magnification</a>, a small <a href="lateral%20geniculate%20nucleus">lateral geniculate nucleus</a> and a large <a href="optic%20tectum">optic tectum</a>, suggesting that the <a href="Midbrain%20tectum">visual midbrain</a> plays a more important role than the <a href="visual%20cortex">visual cortex</a>, as in some rodents. These features suggest that the platypus has adapted to an aquatic and nocturnal lifestyle, developing its electrosensory system at the cost of its visual system; an evolutionary process paralleled by the small number of electroreceptors in the <a href="short-beaked%20echidna">short-beaked echidna</a>, which dwells in dry environments, whilst the <a href="long-beaked%20echidna">long-beaked echidna</a>, which lives in moist environments, is intermediate between the other two monotremes.

The platypus is semiaquatic, inhabiting small streams and rivers over an extensive range from the cold highlands of <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and the <a href="Australian%20Alps">Australian Alps</a> to the <a href="tropical%20rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>s of coastal <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> as far north as the base of the <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a>. Inland, its distribution is not well known; it is extinct in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> (apart from an introduced population on <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a>) and is no longer found in the main part of the <a href="Murray-Darling%20Basin">Murray-Darling Basin</a>, possibly due to the declining <a href="water%20quality">water quality</a> brought about by extensive land clearing and <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> schemes. Along the coastal river systems, its distribution is unpredictable; it appears to be absent from some relatively healthy rivers, and yet maintains a presence in others, for example, the lower <a href="Maribyrnong%20River">Maribyrnong</a>, that are quite degraded.

In captivity, platypuses have survived to 17 years of age, and wild specimens have been recaptured when 11 years old. <a href="Mortality%20rate">Mortality rate</a>s for adults in the wild appear to be low. Natural predators include <a href="snake">snake</a>s, <a href="Rakali">water rats</a>, <a href="goanna">goanna</a>s, <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s, <a href="owl">owl</a>s, and <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s. Low platypus numbers in northern Australia are possibly due to predation by <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s. The introduction of <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es in 1845 for hunting may have had some impact on its numbers on the mainland. The platypus is generally regarded as <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> and <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a>, but individuals are also active during the day, particularly when the sky is overcast. Its habitat bridges <a href="rivers">rivers</a> and the <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian zone</a> for both a food supply of prey species, and banks where it can dig resting and nesting burrows. It may have a range of up to , with a male's home range overlapping those of three or four females.

The platypus is an excellent swimmer and spends much of its time in the water foraging for food. When swimming, it can be distinguished from other Australian mammals by the absence of visible ears. Uniquely among mammals, it propels itself when swimming by an alternate rowing motion of the front feet; although all four feet of the platypus are webbed, the hind feet (which are held against the body) do not assist in propulsion, but are used for steering in combination with the tail. The species is <a href="Warm-blooded">endothermic</a>, maintaining its body temperature at about 32 °C (90 °F), lower than most mammals, even while foraging for hours in water below 5 °C (41 °F).

Dives normally last around 30 seconds, but can last longer, although few exceed the estimated aerobic limit of 40 seconds. Recovery at the surface between dives commonly takes from 10 to 20 seconds.

When not in the water, the platypus retires to a short, straight resting burrow of oval cross-section, nearly always in the riverbank not far above water level, and often <a href="Camouflage">hidden</a> under a protective tangle of roots.

The average sleep time of a platypus is said to be as long as 14 hours per day, possibly because it eats <a href="crustaceans">crustaceans</a>, which provide a high level of calories.

The platypus is a <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>: it feeds on <a href="annelid">annelid</a> worms, <a href="Larva">insect larvae</a>, freshwater <a href="shrimp">shrimp</a>, and <a href="Cherax">freshwater yabby</a> that it digs out of the riverbed with its snout or catches while swimming. It uses cheek-pouches to carry prey to the surface, where it is eaten. The platypus needs to eat about 20% of its own weight each day, which requires it to spend an average of 12 hours daily looking for food.

When the platypus was first encountered by European <a href="natural%20history">naturalists</a>, they were divided over whether the female laid eggs. This was not confirmed until 1884, when <a href="William%20Hay%20Caldwell">William Hay Caldwell</a> was sent to Australia, where, after extensive searching assisted by a team of 150 <a href="Australian%20Aborigines">Aborigines</a>, he managed to discover a few eggs. Mindful of the high cost per word, Caldwell tersely wired <a href="London">London</a>, "Monotremes oviparous, ovum meroblastic." That is, monotremes lay eggs, and the eggs are similar to those of reptiles in that only part of the egg divides as it develops. 

The species exhibits a single <a href="breeding%20season">breeding season</a>; mating occurs between June and October, with some local variation taking place between different populations across its range. Historical observation, <a href="Mark%20and%20recapture">mark-and-recapture</a> studies, and preliminary investigations of population genetics indicate the possibility of both resident and transient members of populations, and suggest a <a href="Polygyny">polygynous</a> mating system. Females are thought likely to become sexually mature in their second year, with breeding confirmed still to take place in animals over nine years old.

Outside the mating season, the platypus lives in a simple ground burrow, the entrance of which is about above the water level. After mating, the female constructs a deeper, more elaborate burrow up to long and blocked at intervals with plugs (which may act as a safeguard against rising waters or predators, or as a method of regulating humidity and temperature). The male takes no part in caring for its young, and retreats to his year-long burrow. The female softens the ground in the burrow with dead, folded, wet leaves, and she fills the nest at the end of the tunnel with fallen leaves and reeds for bedding material. This material is dragged to the nest by tucking it underneath her curled tail.

The female platypus has a pair of <a href="Ovary">ovaries</a>, but only the left one is functional. The platypus's genes are a possible evolutionary link between the mammalian <a href="XY%20sex-determination%20system">XY</a> and bird/reptile <a href="ZW%20sex-determination%20system">ZW</a> sex-determination systems because one of the platypus's five X chromosomes contains the <a href="DMRT1">DMRT1</a> gene, which birds possess on their Z chromosome. It lays one to three (usually two) small, leathery eggs (similar to those of reptiles), about in diameter and slightly rounder than bird eggs. The eggs develop "<a href="in%20utero">in utero</a>" for about 28 days, with only about 10 days of external <a href="Avian%20incubation">incubation</a> (in contrast to a chicken egg, which spends about one day in tract and 21 days externally). After laying her eggs, the female curls around them. The incubation period is divided into three phases. In the first phase, the <a href="embryo">embryo</a> has no functional organs and relies on the <a href="yolk%20sac">yolk sac</a> for sustenance. The yolk is absorbed by the developing young. During the second phase, the digits develop, and in the last phase, the <a href="egg%20tooth">egg tooth</a> appears.

Most mammal zygotes go through <a href="holoblastic">holoblastic</a> cleavage, meaning that following fertilization the ovum is split due to cell divisions into multiple, divisible daughter cells. This is in comparison to the more ancestral process of <a href="meroblastic">meroblastic</a> division in non-mammals (including platypuses), which causes the ovum to split but not completely. This causes the cells at the edge of the yolk to be cytoplasmically continuous with the egg’s cytoplasm. This allows the yolk, which contains the embryo, to exchange waste and nutrients with the cytoplasm.

The newly hatched young are vulnerable, blind, and hairless, and are fed by the mother's milk. Although possessing <a href="mammary%20gland">mammary gland</a>s, the platypus lacks teats. Instead, milk is released through pores in the skin. The milk pools in grooves on her abdomen, allowing the young to lap it up. After they hatch, the offspring are suckled for three to four months. During incubation and weaning, the mother initially leaves the burrow only for short periods, to forage. When doing so, she creates a number of thin soil plugs along the length of the burrow, possibly to protect the young from predators; pushing past these on her return forces water from her fur and allows the burrow to remain dry. After about five weeks, the mother begins to spend more time away from her young and, at around four months, the young emerge from the burrow. A platypus is born with teeth, but these drop out at a very early age, leaving the horny plates it uses to grind food.

The platypus and other monotremes were very poorly understood, and some of the 19th century myths that grew up around them—for example, that the monotremes were "inferior" or <a href="Reptile">quasireptilian</a>—still endure. In 1947, <a href="William%20King%20Gregory">William King Gregory</a> theorised that placental mammals and marsupials may have diverged earlier, and a subsequent branching divided the monotremes and marsupials, but later research and fossil discoveries have suggested this is incorrect. In fact, modern monotremes are the survivors of an early branching of the mammal tree, and a later branching is thought to have led to the <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a> and placental groups. <a href="Molecular%20clock">Molecular clock</a> and fossil dating suggest platypuses split from <a href="echidna">echidna</a>s around 19–48 million years ago.

The oldest discovered fossil of the modern platypus dates back to about 100,000 years ago, during the <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a> period. The extinct monotremes "<a href="Teinolophos">Teinolophos</a>" and "<a href="Steropodon">Steropodon</a>" were once thought to be closely related to the modern platypus, but are now considered more basal taxa. The fossilised "Steropodon" was discovered in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and is composed of an opalised lower jawbone with three molar teeth (whereas the adult contemporary platypus is toothless). The molar teeth were initially thought to be <a href="Tribosphenic%20molar">tribosphenic</a>, which would have supported a variation of Gregory's theory, but later research has suggested, while they have three cusps, they evolved under a separate process. The fossil is thought to be about 110 million years old, making it the oldest mammal fossil found in Australia. Unlike the modern platypus (and <a href="echidna">echidna</a>s), "Teinolophos" lacked a beak.

"<a href="Monotrematum%20sudamericanum">Monotrematum sudamericanum</a>", another fossil relative of the platypus, has been found in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, indicating monotremes were present in the supercontinent of <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> when the continents of <a href="South%20America">South America</a> and Australia were joined via <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> (up to about 167 million years ago). A fossilized tooth of a giant platypus species, "<a href="Obdurodon%20tharalkooschild">Obdurodon tharalkooschild</a>", was dated 5–15 million years ago. Judging by the tooth, the animal measured 1.3 meters long, making it the largest platypus on record.

Because of the early divergence from the <a href="Theria">therian mammals</a> and the low numbers of extant monotreme species, the platypus is a frequent subject of research in evolutionary biology. In 2004, <a href="research">research</a>ers at the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> discovered the platypus has ten <a href="sex%20chromosome">sex chromosome</a>s, compared with two (XY) in most other mammals (for instance, a male platypus is always XYXYXYXYXY), The sex chromosomes of the platypus have been found to have great homology to the bird Z chromosome. The platypus genome also has both reptilian and mammalian genes associated with egg fertilisation. Though the platypus lacks the mammalian sex-determining gene <a href="SRY">SRY</a>, a study found that the mechanism of sex determination is the <a href="Anti-M%C3%BCllerian%20hormone">AMH gene</a> on the oldest <a href="Y%20chromosome">Y chromosome</a>. A draft version of the platypus genome sequence was published in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" on 8 May 2008, revealing both reptilian and mammalian elements, as well as two genes found previously only in birds, amphibians, and fish. More than 80% of the platypus's genes are common to the other mammals whose genomes have been sequenced.

Except for its loss from the state of South Australia, the platypus occupies the same general distribution as it did prior to European settlement of Australia. However, local changes and fragmentation of distribution due to human modification of its habitat are documented. Its current and historical abundance, however, are less well-known and it has probably declined in numbers, although still being considered as common over most of its current range. The species was extensively hunted for its fur until the early years of the 20th century and, although protected throughout Australia since 1905, until about 1950 it was still at risk of drowning in the nets of inland fisheries. The platypus does not appear to be in immediate danger of extinction, because conservation measures have been successful, but it could be affected by habitat disruption caused by dams, irrigation, pollution, netting, and trapping. Reduction of watercourse flows and water levels through excessive droughts and extraction of water for industrial, agricultural, and domestic supplies are also considered a threat. The <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> lists the platypus on its <a href="Red%20List">Red List</a> as "Near Threatened".

Platypuses generally suffer from few diseases in the wild; however, public concern in Tasmania is widespread about the potential impacts of a disease caused by the fungus "<a href="Mucor%20amphibiorum">Mucor amphibiorum</a>". The disease (termed <a href="mucormycosis">mucormycosis</a>) affects only Tasmanian platypuses, and has not been observed in platypuses in mainland Australia. Affected platypuses can develop skin lesions or ulcers on various parts of their bodies, including their backs, tails, and legs. Mucormycosis can kill platypuses, death arising from secondary infection and by affecting the animals' ability to maintain body temperature and forage efficiently. The Biodiversity Conservation Branch at the Department of Primary Industries and Water are collaborating with NRM north and <a href="University%20of%20Tasmania">University of Tasmania</a> researchers to determine the impacts of the disease on Tasmanian platypuses, as well as the mechanism of transmission and current spread of the disease.

Much of the world was introduced to the platypus in 1939 when "<a href="National%20Geographic%20Magazine">National Geographic Magazine</a>" published an article on the platypus and the efforts to study and raise it in captivity. The latter is a difficult task, and only a few young have been successfully raised since, notably at <a href="Healesville%20Sanctuary">Healesville Sanctuary</a> in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. The leading figure in these efforts was <a href="David%20Fleay">David Fleay</a>, who established a platypusary—a simulated stream in a tank—at the Healesville Sanctuary, where breeding was successful in 1943. In 1972, he found a dead baby of about 50 days old, which had presumably been born in captivity, at his <a href="David%20Fleay%20Wildlife%20Park">wildlife park</a> at <a href="Burleigh%20Heads%2C%20Queensland">Burleigh Heads</a> on the <a href="Gold%20Coast%2C%20Queensland">Gold Coast</a>, Queensland. Healesville repeated its success in 1998 and again in 2000 with a similar stream tank. Since 2008, platypus has bred regularly at Healesville, including second-generation (captive born themselves breeding in captivity). <a href="Taronga%20Zoo">Taronga Zoo</a> in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> bred twins in 2003, and breeding was again successful there in 2006.

The platypus is kept, for conservation purposes, in special aquariums at the following Australian wildlife sanctuaries:




, there is no platypus in captivity outside of Australia. Three attempts were made to bring the animals to the <a href="Bronx%20Zoo">Bronx Zoo</a>, in 1922, 1947, and 1958; of these, only two of the three animals introduced in 1947 lived longer than eighteen months.

The platypus has been a subject in the <a href="Dreamtime">Dreamtime</a> stories of <a href="indigenous%20Australians">indigenous Australians</a>, who believed the animal was a hybrid of a duck and a <a href="Rakali">water rat</a>. According to one story, the major animal groups, the land animals, water animals and birds, all competed for the platypus to join their respective groups, but the platypus ultimately decided to not join any of them, feeling that he did not need to be part of a group to be special.

Platypuses has been used several times as a mascot: "Syd" the platypus was one of the three mascots chosen for the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">Sydney 2000 Olympics</a> along with an echidna and a <a href="kookaburra">kookaburra</a>, "Expo Oz" the platypus was the mascot for <a href="World%20Expo%2088">World Expo 88</a>, which was held in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> in 1988, and <a href="Hexley">Hexley</a> the platypus is the mascot for <a href="Apple%20Computer">Apple Computer</a>'s <a href="BSD">BSD</a>-based <a href="Darwin%20%28operating%20system%29">Darwin</a> operating system, Mac OS X.

The platypus has been featured in songs, such as <a href="Green%20Day">Green Day</a>'s "Platypus (I Hate You)" and <a href="Mr.%20Bungle">Mr. Bungle</a>'s "Platypus". It is the subject of a children's poem by <a href="Banjo%20Paterson">Banjo Paterson</a>.

The platypus has frequently appeared in Australian postage stamps and coins. The earliest appearance is the 9d Australian stamp from 1937. The platypus re-appeared in the 1960–64 Australian Native Animal Series. Souvenir sheet of "from" Laos and Equatorial Guinea has also featured the animal. The platypus has appeared on a 1987 36 cent stamp and an Australian 1996 95 cent stamp. The 2006 Australian Bush Babies stamp series features a $4.65AUD stamp of a young platypus. A 5 cent stamp also produced in 2006 features the platypus also. Since the introduction of <a href="decimal%20currency">decimal currency</a> to <a href="Australia">Australia</a> in 1966, the embossed image of a platypus, designed and sculpted by <a href="Stuart%20Devlin">Stuart Devlin</a>, has appeared on the reverse (tails) side of the <a href="Australian%20twenty-cent%20coin">20-cent coin</a>.

In the animated series "<a href="Phineas%20and%20Ferb">Phineas and Ferb</a>", the title characters own a pet platypus, named <a href="Perry%20the%20Platypus">Perry</a>, who unknown to them, is a secret agent. The choice of a platypus was inspired by media underuse, as well as to exploit the animal's striking appearance. As a character, Perry has been well received by both fans and critics.

Planets beyond Neptune

Following the discovery of the planet <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another <a href="planet">planet</a> might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and continued at the start of the 20th with <a href="Percival%20Lowell">Percival Lowell</a>'s quest for Planet X. Lowell proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain <a href="Discovery%20of%20Neptune%23Irregularities%20in%20Uranus%27s%20orbit">apparent discrepancies</a> in the <a href="orbit">orbit</a>s of the giant planets, particularly <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> and Neptune, speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have <a href="gravitational%20perturbation">perturbed</a> Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.

<a href="Clyde%20Tombaugh">Clyde Tombaugh</a>'s discovery of <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a> in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell's hypothesis, and Pluto was officially named the ninth planet. In 1978, Pluto was conclusively determined to be too small for its gravity to affect the giant planets, resulting in a brief search for a tenth planet. The search was largely abandoned in the early 1990s, when a study of measurements made by the "<a href="Voyager%202">Voyager 2</a>" spacecraft found that the irregularities observed in Uranus's orbit were due to a slight overestimation of Neptune's mass. After 1992, the discovery of numerous small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than Pluto led to a debate over whether Pluto should remain a planet, or whether it and its neighbours should, like the <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s, be given their own separate classification. Although a number of the larger members of this group were initially described as planets, in 2006 the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU) reclassified Pluto and its largest neighbours as <a href="dwarf%20planet">dwarf planet</a>s, leaving Neptune the farthest known planet in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>.

While the astronomical community widely agrees that Planet X, as originally envisioned, does not exist, the concept of an as-yet-unobserved planet has been revived by a number of astronomers to explain other anomalies observed in the outer Solar System. As of March 2014, observations with the <a href="Wide-field%20Infrared%20Survey%20Explorer">WISE telescope</a> have ruled out the possibility of a <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>-sized object (95 Earth masses) out to 10,000 <a href="astronomical%20unit">AU</a>, and a <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>-sized (≈318 Earth masses) or larger object out to 26,000 AU.

In 2014, based on similarities of the orbits of a group of recently discovered <a href="extreme%20trans-Neptunian%20object">extreme trans-Neptunian object</a>s, astronomers hypothesized the existence of a super-Earth planet, 2 to 15 times the mass of the Earth and beyond 200 AU with possibly a high inclined orbit at some 1,500 AU. In 2016, further work showed this unknown distant planet is likely on an inclined, eccentric orbit that goes no closer than about 200 AU and no farther than about 1,200 AU from the Sun. The orbit is predicted to be anti-aligned to the clustered extreme trans-Neptunian objects. Because Pluto is no longer considered a planet by the IAU, this new hypothetical object has become known as <a href="Planet%20Nine">Planet Nine</a>.

In the 1840s, the French mathematician <a href="Urbain%20Le%20Verrier">Urbain Le Verrier</a> used <a href="Classical%20mechanics">Newtonian mechanics</a> to analyse perturbations in the orbit of Uranus, and hypothesised that they were caused by the gravitational pull of a yet-undiscovered planet. Le Verrier predicted the position of this new planet and sent his calculations to German astronomer <a href="Johann%20Gottfried%20Galle">Johann Gottfried Galle</a>. On 23 September 1846, the night following his receipt of the letter, Galle and his student <a href="Heinrich%20Louis%20d%27Arrest">Heinrich d'Arrest</a> discovered Neptune, exactly where Le Verrier had predicted. There remained some slight discrepancies in the <a href="giant%20planet">giant planet</a>s' orbits. These were taken to indicate the existence of yet another planet orbiting beyond Neptune.

Even before Neptune's discovery, some speculated that one planet alone was not enough to explain the discrepancy. On 17 November 1834, the British amateur astronomer the Reverend <a href="Thomas%20John%20Hussey">Thomas John Hussey</a> reported a conversation he had had with French astronomer <a href="Alexis%20Bouvard">Alexis Bouvard</a> to <a href="George%20Biddell%20Airy">George Biddell Airy</a>, the British Astronomer Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with <a href="Peter%20Andreas%20Hansen">Peter Andreas Hansen</a>, director of the <a href="Gotha%20Observatory">Seeberg Observatory</a> in <a href="Gotha">Gotha</a>, about the subject. Hansen's opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus.

In 1848, <a href="Jacques%20Babinet">Jacques Babinet</a> raised an objection to Le Verrier's calculations, claiming that Neptune's observed mass was smaller and its orbit larger than Le Verrier had initially predicted. He postulated, based largely on simple subtraction from Le Verrier's calculations, that another planet of roughly 12 Earth masses, which he named "Hyperion", must exist beyond Neptune. Le Verrier denounced Babinet's hypothesis, saying, "[There is] absolutely nothing by which one could determine the position of another planet, barring hypotheses in which imagination played too large a part."

In 1850 <a href="James%20Ferguson%20%28American%20astronomer%29">James Ferguson</a>, Assistant Astronomer at the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Observatory">United States Naval Observatory</a>, noted that he had "lost" a star he had observed, GR1719k, which Lt. Matthew Maury, the superintendent of the Observatory, claimed was evidence that it must be a new planet. Subsequent searches failed to recover the "planet" in a different position, and in 1878, <a href="CHF%20Peters">CHF Peters</a>, director of the <a href="Hamilton%20College%20%28New%20York%29">Hamilton College</a> Observatory in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, showed that the star had not in fact vanished, and that the previous results had been due to human error.

In 1879, <a href="Camille%20Flammarion">Camille Flammarion</a> noted that the comets <a href="Comet%20Swift%E2%80%93Tuttle">1862 III</a> and <a href="177P/Barnard">1889 III</a> had <a href="Apsis">aphelia</a> of 47 and 49 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a>, respectively, suggesting that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer <a href="George%20Forbes%20%28scientist%29">George Forbes</a> concluded on the basis of this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune. He calculated, based on the fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100 AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300 AU, the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named <a href="David%20Peck%20Todd">David Peck Todd</a>, suggesting to many that they might be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. George Forbes is today considered to be the first describing <a href="Planet%20Nine">Planet Nine</a>.

In 1900 and 1901, <a href="Harvard%20College%20Observatory">Harvard College Observatory</a> director <a href="William%20Henry%20Pickering">William Henry Pickering</a> led two searches for trans-Neptunian planets. The first was begun by Danish astronomer <a href="Hans%20E.%20Lau">Hans Emil Lau</a> who, after studying the data on the orbit of Uranus from 1690 to 1895, concluded that one trans-Neptunian planet alone could not account for the discrepancies in its orbit, and postulated the position of two planets he believed were responsible. The second was launched when Gabriel Dallet suggested that a single trans-Neptunian planet lying at 47 AU could account for the motion of Uranus. Pickering agreed to examine plates for any suspected planets. In neither case were any found.

In 1909, <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson%20Jackson%20See">Thomas Jefferson Jackson See</a>, an astronomer with a reputation as an egocentric contrarian, opined "that there is certainly one, most likely two and possibly three planets beyond Neptune". Tentatively naming the first planet "Oceanus", he placed their respective distances at 42, 56 and 72 AU from the Sun. He gave no indication as to how he determined their existence, and no known searches were mounted to locate them.

In 1911, Indian astronomer Venkatesh P. Ketakar suggested the existence of two trans-Neptunian planets, which he named <a href="Brahma">Brahma</a> and <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, by reworking the patterns observed by <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a> in the planetary satellites of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and applying them to the outer planets. The three inner <a href="Galilean%20moons">Galilean moons</a> of Jupiter, <a href="Io%20%28moon%29">Io</a>, <a href="Europa%20%28moon%29">Europa</a> and <a href="Ganymede%20%28moon%29">Ganymede</a>, are locked in a complicated 1:2:4 resonance called a <a href="Orbital%20resonance%23The%20Laplace%20resonance">Laplace resonance</a>. Ketakar suggested that Uranus, Neptune and his hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets were locked in Laplace-like resonances. His calculations predicted a mean distance for Brahma of 38.95 AU and an orbital period of 242.28 Earth years (3:4 resonance with Neptune). When Pluto was discovered 19 years later, its mean distance of 39.48 AU and orbital period of 248 Earth years were close to Ketakar's prediction (Pluto in fact has a <a href="Plutino">2:3 resonance with Neptune</a>). Ketakar made no predictions for the orbital elements other than mean distance and period. It is not clear how Ketakar arrived at these figures, and his second planet, Vishnu, was never located.

In 1894, with the help of William Pickering, <a href="Percival%20Lowell">Percival Lowell</a>, a wealthy Bostonian, founded the <a href="Lowell%20Observatory">Lowell Observatory</a> in <a href="Flagstaff%2C%20Arizona">Flagstaff, Arizona</a>. In 1906, convinced he could resolve the conundrum of Uranus's orbit, he began an extensive project to search for a trans-Neptunian planet, which he named "Planet X", a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. The "X" in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter, as opposed to the <a href="Roman%20numeral">Roman numeral</a> for 10 (at the time, Planet X would have been the ninth planet). Lowell's hope in tracking down Planet X was to establish his scientific credibility, which had eluded him due to his widely derided belief that channel-like features visible on the surface of <a href="Mars">Mars</a> were <a href="Martian%20canal">canals constructed by an intelligent civilization</a>.

Lowell's first search focused on the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>, the plane encompassed by the <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a> where the other planets in the Solar System lie. Using a 5-inch photographic camera, he manually examined over 200 three-hour exposures with a magnifying glass, and found no planets. At that time Pluto was too far above the ecliptic to be imaged by the survey. After revising his predicted possible locations, Lowell conducted a second search from 1914 to 1916. In 1915, he published his "Memoir of a Trans-Neptunian Planet", in which he concluded that Planet X had a mass roughly seven times that of Earth—about half that of Neptune—and a mean distance from the Sun of 43 AU. He assumed Planet X would be a large, low-density object with a high <a href="albedo">albedo</a>, like the giant planets. As a result, it would show a disc with diameter of about one arcsecond and an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of between 12 and 13—bright enough to be spotted.

Separately, in 1908, Pickering announced that, by analysing irregularities in Uranus's orbit, he had found evidence for a ninth planet. His hypothetical planet, which he termed "Planet O" (because it came after "N", i.e. Neptune), possessed a mean orbital radius of 51.9 AU and an orbital period of 373.5 years. Plates taken at his observatory in <a href="Arequipa">Arequipa</a>, Peru, showed no evidence for the predicted planet, and British astronomer <a href="Philip%20Herbert%20Cowell">P. H. Cowell</a> showed that the irregularities observed in Uranus's orbit virtually disappeared once the planet's displacement of longitude was taken into account. Lowell himself, despite his close association with Pickering, dismissed Planet O out of hand, saying, "This planet is very properly designated "O", [for it] is nothing at all." Unbeknownst to Pickering, four of the photographic plates taken in the search for "Planet O" by astronomers at the Mount Wilson Observatory in 1919 captured images of Pluto, though this was only recognised years later. Pickering went on to suggest many other possible trans-Neptunian planets up to the year 1932, which he named "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T" and "U"; none were ever detected.

Lowell's sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted the search for Planet X. Failing to find the planet, according to one friend, "virtually killed him". Lowell's widow, Constance, engaged in a legal battle with the observatory over Lowell's legacy which halted the search for Planet X for several years. In 1925, the observatory obtained glass discs for a new wide-field telescope to continue the search, constructed with funds from <a href="Abbott%20Lawrence%20Lowell">Abbott Lawrence Lowell</a>, Percival's brother. In 1929 the observatory's director, <a href="Vesto%20Melvin%20Slipher">Vesto Melvin Slipher</a>, summarily handed the job of locating the planet to <a href="Clyde%20Tombaugh">Clyde Tombaugh</a>, a 22-year-old Kansas farm boy who had only just arrived at the Lowell Observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.

Tombaugh's task was to systematically capture sections of the night sky in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a <a href="blink%20comparator">blink comparator</a>, which by exchanging images quickly created a <a href="Time-lapse%20photography">time lapse</a> illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce the chances that a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the <a href="apparent%20retrograde%20motion">apparent retrograde motion</a> for objects beyond Earth's orbit is at its strongest. He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.
By the beginning of 1930, Tombaugh's search had reached the constellation of Gemini. On 18 February 1930, after searching for nearly a year and examining nearly 2 million stars, Tombaugh discovered a moving object on photographic plates taken on 23 January and 29 January of that year. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 confirmed the movement. Upon confirmation, Tombaugh walked into Slipher's office and declared, "Doctor Slipher, I have found your Planet X." The object lay just six degrees from one of two locations for Planet X Lowell had suggested; thus it seemed he had at last been vindicated. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the <a href="Harvard%20College%20Observatory">Harvard College Observatory</a> on March 13, 1930. The new object was later <a href="Precovery">precovered</a> on photographs dating back to 19 March 1915. The decision to name the object "Pluto" was intended in part to honour Percival Lowell, as his initials made up the word's first two letters. After discovering Pluto, Tombaugh continued to search the ecliptic for other distant objects. He found hundreds of <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a>s and <a href="Clyde%20Tombaugh%23Asteroids%20discovered">asteroids</a>, as well as two <a href="comet">comet</a>s, but no further planets.

To the observatory's disappointment and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it appeared as a point, no different from a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to <a href="Perturbation%20%28astronomy%29">perturb</a> planets, they assumed that its <a href="Albedo%23Astronomical%20albedo">albedo</a> could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it); about as dark as asphalt and similar to that of <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>, the least reflective planet known. This would give Pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70% that of Earth. Observations also revealed that Pluto's orbit was very elliptical, far more than that of any other planet.

Almost immediately, some astronomers questioned Pluto's status as a planet. Barely a month after its discovery was announced, on April 14, 1930, in an article in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Armin%20Otto%20Leuschner">Armin O. Leuschner</a> suggested that Pluto's dimness and high orbital eccentricity made it more similar to an asteroid or comet: "The Lowell result confirms the possible high eccentricity announced by us on April 5. Among the possibilities are a large asteroid greatly disturbed in its orbit by close approach to a major planet such as Jupiter, or it may be one of many long-period planetary objects yet to be discovered, or a bright cometary object." In that same article, <a href="Harvard%20Observatory">Harvard Observatory</a> director <a href="Harlow%20Shapley">Harlow Shapley</a> wrote that Pluto was a "member of the Solar System not comparable with known asteroids and comets, and perhaps of greater importance to cosmogony than would be another major planet beyond Neptune." In 1931, using a mathematical formula, <a href="Ernest%20W.%20Brown">Ernest W. Brown</a> asserted (in agreement with <a href="E.%20C.%20Bower">E. C. Bower</a>), that the presumed irregularities in the orbit of Uranus could not be due to the gravitational effect of a more distant planet, and thus that Lowell's supposed prediction was "purely accidental".

Throughout the mid-20th century, estimates of Pluto's mass were revised downward. In 1931, Nicholson and Mayall calculated its mass, based on its supposed effect on the giant planets, as roughly that of Earth; a value somewhat in accord with the 0.91 Earth mass calculated in 1942 by <a href="Lloyd%20R.%20Wylie">Lloyd R. Wylie</a> at the <a href="US%20Naval%20Observatory">US Naval Observatory</a>, using the same assumptions. In 1949, <a href="Gerard%20Kuiper">Gerard Kuiper</a>'s measurements of Pluto's diameter with the 200 inch telescope at <a href="Mount%20Palomar%20Observatory">Mount Palomar Observatory</a> led him to the conclusion that it was midway in size between Mercury and Mars and that its mass was most probably about 0.1 Earth mass.

In 1973, based on the similarities in the periodicity and amplitude of brightness variation with <a href="Triton%20%28moon%29">Triton</a>, Dennis Rawlins conjectured Pluto's mass must be similar to Triton's. In retrospect, the conjecture turns out to have been correct; it had been argued by astronomers <a href="Walter%20Baade">Walter Baade</a> and E.C. Bower as early as 1934. However, because Triton's mass was then believed to be roughly 2.5% of the Earth–Moon system (more than ten times its actual value), Rawlins's determination for Pluto's mass was similarly incorrect. It was nonetheless a meagre enough value for him to conclude Pluto was not Planet X. In 1976, Dale Cruikshank, Carl Pilcher, and David Morrison of the <a href="University%20of%20Hawaii">University of Hawaii</a> analysed spectra from Pluto's surface and determined that it must contain <a href="methane">methane</a> <a href="volatiles">ice</a>, which is highly reflective. This meant that Pluto, far from being dark, was in fact exceptionally bright, and thus was probably no more than  Earth mass.

Pluto's size was finally determined conclusively in 1978, when American astronomer <a href="James%20W.%20Christy">James W. Christy</a> discovered its moon <a href="Charon%20%28moon%29">Charon</a>. This enabled him, together with <a href="Robert%20Sutton%20Harrington">Robert Sutton Harrington</a> of the U.S. Naval Observatory, to measure the mass of the Pluto–Charon system directly by observing the moon's orbital motion around Pluto. They determined Pluto's mass to be 1.31×10 kg; roughly one five-hundredth that of Earth or one-sixth that of the Moon, and far too small to account for the observed discrepancies in the orbits of the outer planets. Lowell's "prediction" had been a coincidence: If there was a Planet X, it was not Pluto.

After 1978, a number of astronomers kept up the search for Lowell's Planet X, convinced that, because Pluto was no longer a viable candidate, an unseen tenth planet must have been perturbing the outer planets.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Robert Harrington led a search to determine the real cause of the apparent irregularities. He calculated that any Planet X would be at roughly three times the distance of Neptune from the Sun; its orbit would be highly <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">eccentric</a>, and strongly <a href="orbital%20inclination">inclined</a> to the ecliptic—the planet's orbit would be at roughly a 32-degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets. This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception. Noted Planet X sceptic <a href="Brian%20G.%20Marsden">Brian G. Marsden</a> of the <a href="Minor%20Planet%20Center">Minor Planet Center</a> pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le Verrier, and could easily be due to observational error.

In 1972, Joseph Brady of the <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> studied irregularities in the motion of <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley's Comet</a>. Brady claimed that they could have been caused by a Jupiter-sized planet beyond Neptune at 59 AU that is in a <a href="retrograde%20orbit">retrograde orbit</a> around the Sun. However, both Marsden and Planet X proponent <a href="P.%20Kenneth%20Seidelmann">P. Kenneth Seidelmann</a> attacked the hypothesis, showing that Halley's Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material, causing changes to its own orbital trajectory, and that such a massive object as Brady's Planet X would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets.

Although its mission did not involve a search for Planet X, the <a href="IRAS">IRAS</a> space observatory made headlines briefly in 1983 due to an "unknown object" that was at first described as "possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this Solar System". Further analysis revealed that of several unidentified objects, nine were distant galaxies and the tenth was "<a href="infrared%20cirrus">interstellar cirrus</a>"; none were found to be Solar System bodies.

In 1988, A. A. Jackson and R. M. Killen studied the stability of Pluto's resonance with Neptune by placing test "Planet X-es" with various masses and at various distances from Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's orbits are in a 3:2 resonance, which prevents their collision or even any close approaches, regardless of their separation in the <a href="z%20axis">z axis</a>. It was found that the hypothetical object's mass had to exceed 5 Earth masses to break the resonance, and the parameter space is quite large and a large variety of objects could have existed beyond Pluto without disturbing the resonance. Four test orbits of a trans-Plutonian planet have been integrated forward for four million years in order to determine the effects of such a body on the stability of the Neptune–Pluto 3:2 resonance. Planets beyond Pluto with masses of 0.1 and 1.0 Earth masses in orbits at 48.3 and 75.5 AU, respectively, do not disturb the 3:2 resonance. Test planets of 5 Earth masses with semi-major axes of 52.5 and 62.5 AU disrupt the four-million-year libration of Pluto's argument of perihelion.

Harrington died in January 1993, without having found Planet X. Six months before, <a href="E.%20Myles%20Standish">E. Myles Standish</a> had used data from "Voyager 2"&apos;s 1989 flyby of Neptune, which had revised the planet's total mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. When Neptune's newly determined mass was used in the <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory%20Developmental%20Ephemeris">Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris</a> (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as "<a href="Pioneer%2010">Pioneer 10</a>", "<a href="Pioneer%2011">Pioneer 11</a>", "<a href="Voyager%201">Voyager 1</a>", and "<a href="Voyager%202">Voyager 2</a>" that can be attributed to the gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System. Today, most astronomers agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.

After the discovery of Pluto and Charon, no more <a href="trans-Neptunian%20object">trans-Neptunian object</a>s (TNOs) were found until <a href="15760%20Albion">15760 Albion</a> in 1992. Since then, thousands of such objects have been discovered. Most are now recognized as part of the <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a>, a swarm of icy bodies left over from the Solar System's formation that orbit near the <a href="plane%20of%20the%20ecliptic">ecliptic plane</a> just beyond Neptune. Though none were as large as Pluto, some of these distant trans-Neptunian objects, such as <a href="90377%20Sedna">Sedna</a>, were initially described in the media as "new planets".

In 2005, astronomer <a href="Michael%20E.%20Brown">Mike Brown</a> and his team announced the discovery of (later named after the Greek goddess of discord and strife), a trans-Neptunian object then thought to be just barely larger than Pluto. Soon afterwards, a NASA <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> press release described the object as the "tenth planet".

Eris was never officially classified as a planet, and the <a href="IAU%20definition%20of%20planet">2006 definition of planet</a> defined both Eris and Pluto not as planets but as dwarf planets because they have not <a href="clearing%20the%20neighbourhood">cleared their neighbourhoods</a>. They do not orbit the Sun alone, but as part of a population of similarly sized objects. Pluto itself is now recognized as being a member of the Kuiper belt and the largest dwarf planet, larger than the more-massive Eris.

A number of astronomers, most notably <a href="Alan%20Stern">Alan Stern</a>, the head of NASA's "<a href="New%20Horizons">New Horizons</a>" mission to Pluto, contend that the IAU's definition is flawed, and that Pluto and Eris, and all large trans-Neptunian objects, such as , , , and , should be considered planets in their own right. However, the discovery of Eris did not rehabilitate the Planet X theory because it is far too small to have significant effects on the outer planets' orbits.

Although most astronomers accept that Lowell's Planet X does not exist, a number have revived the idea that a large unseen planet could create observable gravitational effects in the outer Solar System. These hypothetical objects are often referred to as "Planet X", although the conception of these objects may differ considerably from that proposed by Lowell.

When <a href="90377%20Sedna">Sedna</a> was discovered, its extreme orbit raised questions about its origin. Its perihelion is so distant (approximately 75 AU) that no currently observed mechanism can explain Sedna's eccentric distant orbit. It is too far from the planets to have been affected by the gravity of Neptune or the other giant planets and too bound to the Sun to be affected by outside forces such as the <a href="galactic%20tide">galactic tide</a>s. Hypotheses to explain its orbit include that it was affected by a passing star, that it was captured from another <a href="planetary%20system">planetary system</a>, or that it was tugged into its current position by a trans-Neptunian planet. The most obvious solution to determining Sedna's peculiar orbit would be to locate a number of objects in a similar region, whose various orbital configurations would provide an indication as to their history. If Sedna had been pulled into its orbit by a trans-Neptunian planet, any other objects found in its region would have a similar perihelion to Sedna (around 80 AU).

In 2008 Tadashi Mukai and Patryk Sofia Lykawka suggested a distant Mars- or Earth-sized planet, currently in a highly eccentric orbit between 100 and and orbital period of 1000 years with an inclination of 20° to 40°, was responsible for the structure of the Kuiper belt. They proposed that the perturbations of this planet excited the eccentricities and inclinations of the <a href="trans-Neptunian%20object">trans-Neptunian object</a>s, truncated the planetesimal disk at 48 AU, and detached the orbits of objects like Sedna from Neptune. During Neptune's migration this planet is posited to have been captured in an outer resonance of Neptune and to have evolved into a higher perihelion orbit due to the <a href="Kozai%20mechanism">Kozai mechanism</a> leaving the remaining trans-Neptunian objects on stable orbits.

In 2012, Rodney Gomes modelled the orbits of 92 Kuiper belt objects and found that six of those orbits were far more elongated than the model predicted. He concluded that the simplest explanation was the gravitational pull of a distant planetary companion, such as a Neptune-sized object at 1,500 AU. This Neptune-sized object would cause the perihelia of objects with semi-major axes greater than 300 AU to oscillate, delivering them into planet-crossing orbits like those of and or detached orbits like Sedna's.

In 2014, astronomers announced the discovery of , a large object with a Sedna-like 4,200-year orbit and a perihelion of roughly 80 AU, which led them to suggest that it offered evidence of a potential trans-Neptunian planet. <a href="Chad%20Trujillo">Trujillo</a> and <a href="Scott%20S.%20Sheppard">Sheppard</a> argued that the orbital clustering of <a href="argument%20of%20perihelion">arguments of perihelia</a> for VP113 and other extremely distant TNOs suggests the existence of a "<a href="super-Earth">super-Earth</a>" of between 2 and 15 Earth masses beyond 200 AU and possibly on an inclined orbit at 1500 AU.

In 2014 astronomers at the <a href="Universidad%20Complutense">Universidad Complutense</a> in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> suggested that the available data actually indicate more than one trans-Neptunian planet; subsequent work further suggests that the evidence is robust enough.

On January 20, 2016, Brown and <a href="Konstantin%20Batygin">Konstantin Batygin</a> published an article corroborating Trujillo and Sheppard's initial findings; proposing a super-Earth (dubbed <a href="Planet%20Nine">Planet Nine</a>) based on a statistical clustering of the arguments of perihelia (noted before) near zero and also <a href="ascending%20node">ascending node</a>s near 113° of six distant <a href="trans-Neptunian%20object">trans-Neptunian object</a>s. They estimated it to be ten times the mass of <a href="Earth">Earth</a> (about 60% the mass of Neptune) with a <a href="semimajor%20axis">semimajor axis</a> of approximately 400–1500 <a href="astronomical%20unit">AU</a>.

Even without gravitational evidence, Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna, has argued that Sedna's 12,000-year orbit means that probability alone suggests that an Earth-sized object exists beyond Neptune. Sedna's orbit is so eccentric that it spends only a small fraction of its orbital period near the Sun, where it can be easily observed. This means that unless its discovery was a freak accident, there is probably a substantial population of objects roughly Sedna's diameter yet to be observed in its orbital region. Mike Brown noted that "Sedna is about three-quarters the size of Pluto. If there are sixty objects three-quarters the size of Pluto [out there] then there are probably forty objects the size of Pluto ... If there are forty objects the size of Pluto, then there are probably ten that are twice the size of Pluto. There are probably three or four that are three times the size of Pluto, and the biggest of these objects ... is probably the size of Mars or the size of the Earth." However, he notes that, should such an object be found, even though it might approach Earth in size, it would still be a dwarf planet by the current definition, because it would not have cleared its neighbourhood sufficiently.

Additionally, speculation of a possible trans-Neptunian planet has revolved around the so-called "<a href="Kuiper%20Belt%23Kuiper%20cliff">Kuiper cliff</a>". The Kuiper belt terminates suddenly at a distance of 48 AU from the Sun. Brunini and Melita have speculated that this sudden drop-off may be attributed to the presence of an object with a mass between those of Mars and Earth located beyond 48 AU. The presence of an object with a mass similar to that of Mars in a circular orbit at 60 AU leads to a trans-Neptunian object population incompatible with observations. For instance, it would severely deplete the <a href="plutino">plutino</a> population. Astronomers have not excluded the possibility of an object with a mass similar to that of Earth located farther than 100 AU with an <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">eccentric</a> and inclined orbit. Computer simulations by Patryk Lykawka of <a href="Kobe%20University">Kobe University</a> have suggested that an object with a mass between 0.3 and 0.7 Earth masses, ejected outward by Neptune early in the Solar System's formation and currently in an elongated orbit between 101 and 200 AU from the Sun, could explain the Kuiper cliff and the peculiar <a href="detached%20object">detached object</a>s such as Sedna and . Although some astronomers, such as Renu Malhotra and David Jewitt, have cautiously supported these claims, others, such as Alessandro Morbidelli, have dismissed them as "contrived". In 2017, Malhotra and Kat Volk argued that an unexpected variance in inclination for KBOs farther than the cliff at 50 AU provided evidence of a possible Mars-sized planet residing at the edge of the Solar System.

<a href="Tyche%20%28hypothetical%20planet%29">Tyche</a> was a hypothetical <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a> proposed to be located in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>'s <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a>. It was first proposed in 1999 by astrophysicists John Matese, Patrick Whitman and Daniel Whitmire of the <a href="University%20of%20Louisiana%20at%20Lafayette">University of Louisiana at Lafayette</a>. They argued that evidence of Tyche's existence could be seen in a supposed bias in the points of origin for <a href="long-period%20comet">long-period comet</a>s. In 2013, Matese and Whitmire re-evaluated the comet data and noted that Tyche, if it existed, would be detectable in the archive of data that was collected by <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="Wide-field%20Infrared%20Survey%20Explorer">Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer</a> (WISE) telescope. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object with Tyche's characteristics, indicating that Tyche as hypothesized by Matese, Whitman, and Whitmire does not exist.

The oligarch theory of <a href="Nebular%20hypothesis%23Formation%20of%20planets">planet formation</a> states that there were hundreds of planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, in the early stages of the Solar System's evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today, most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become <a href="rogue%20planet">free-floating planets</a>, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods of millions of years. This halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000 AU from the Sun, or between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the <a href="Oort%20cloud">Oort cloud</a>.

In December 2015, astronomers at the <a href="Atacama%20Large%20Millimeter%20Array">Atacama Large Millimeter Array</a> (ALMA) detected a brief series of 350 GHz pulses that they concluded must either be a series of independent sources, or a single, fast moving source. Deciding that the latter was the most likely, they calculated based on its speed that, were it bound to the Sun, the object, which they named "Gna" after a <a href="Gn%C3%A1%20and%20H%C3%B3fvarpnir">fast-moving messenger goddess</a> in Norse mythology, would be about 12–25 AU distant and have a <a href="dwarf%20planet">dwarf planet</a>-sized diameter of 220 to 880 km. However, if it were a <a href="rogue%20planet">rogue planet</a> not gravitationally bound to the Sun, and as far away as 4000 AU, it could be much larger. The paper was never formally accepted, and has been withdrawn until the detection is confirmed. Scientists' reactions to the notice were largely sceptical; Mike Brown commented that, "If it is true that ALMA accidentally discovered a massive outer Solar System object in its tiny, tiny, tiny, field of view, that would suggest that there are something like 200,000 Earth-sized planets in the outer Solar System ... Even better, I just realized that this many Earth-sized planets existing would destabilize the entire Solar System and we would all die."

As of 2016 the following observations severely constrain the mass and distance of any possible additional Solar System planet:

Passenger pigeon

The passenger pigeon or wild pigeon ("Ectopistes migratorius") is an <a href="Bird%20extinction">extinct species</a> of <a href="Columbidae">pigeon</a> that was endemic to <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. Its common name is derived from the French word "passager", meaning "passing by", due to the migratory habits of the species. The scientific name also refers to its migratory characteristics. The morphologically similar <a href="mourning%20dove">mourning dove</a> ("Zenaida macroura") was long thought to be its closest relative, and the two were at times confused, but genetic analysis has shown that the genus "<a href="Patagioenas">Patagioenas</a>" is more closely related to it than the <a href="Zenaida%20doves">"Zenaida" doves</a>.

The passenger pigeon was <a href="sexually%20dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a> in size and coloration. The male was in length, mainly gray on the upperparts, lighter on the underparts, with <a href="iridescent">iridescent</a> bronze feathers on the neck, and black spots on the wings. The female was , and was duller and browner than the male overall. The juvenile was similar to the female, but without iridescence. It mainly inhabited the <a href="deciduous%20forests">deciduous forests</a> of eastern North America and was also recorded elsewhere, but bred primarily around the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. The pigeon migrated in enormous flocks, constantly searching for food, shelter, and breeding grounds, and was once the most abundant bird in North America, numbering around 3 billion, and possibly up to 5 billion, “at the time of the discovery of America,” according to <a href="Arlie%20W.%20Schorger">A. W. Schorger</a>.

Though one genetic study concluded that the bird was not always that abundant, and that the population size fluctuated dramatically over time, a more recent study found evidence that this was not the correct interpretation of the genetic data, and instead concluded that the passenger pigeon population size had been stable for at least 20,000 years prior to "its 19th-century decline and eventual extinction." A very fast flyer, the passenger pigeon could reach a speed of . The bird fed mainly on <a href="Mast%20%28botany%29">mast</a>, and also fruits and invertebrates. It practiced <a href="communal%20roosting">communal roosting</a> and <a href="communal%20breeding">communal breeding</a>, and its extreme gregariousness may be linked with searching for food and <a href="predator%20satiation">predator satiation</a>.

Passenger pigeons were hunted by Native Americans, but hunting intensified after the arrival of Europeans, particularly in the 19th century. Pigeon meat was commercialized as cheap food, resulting in <a href="hunting">hunting</a> on a massive scale for many decades. There were several other factors contributing to the decline and subsequent extinction of the species, including shrinking of the large breeding populations necessary for preservation of the species and widespread <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>, which destroyed its <a href="habitat">habitat</a>. A slow decline between about 1800 and 1870 was followed by a rapid decline between 1870 and 1890. The last confirmed wild bird is thought to have been shot in 1901. The last captive birds were divided in three groups around the turn of the 20th century, some of which were photographed alive. <a href="Martha%20%28pigeon%29">Martha</a>, thought to be the last passenger pigeon, died on September 1, 1914, at the <a href="Cincinnati%20Zoo%20and%20Botanical%20Garden">Cincinnati Zoo</a>. The eradication of this species is a notable example of <a href="Holocene%20extinction">anthropogenic extinction</a>.

Swedish naturalist <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> coined the binomial name "<a href="Columba%20%28genus%29">Columba</a> macroura" for both the <a href="mourning%20dove">mourning dove</a> and the passenger pigeon in the 1758 edition of his work "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" (the starting point of <a href="biological%20nomenclature">biological nomenclature</a>), wherein he appears to have considered the two identical. This composite description cited accounts of these birds in two pre-Linnean books. One of these was <a href="Mark%20Catesby">Mark Catesby</a>'s description of the passenger pigeon, which was published in his 1731 to 1743 work "Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands", which referred to this bird as "Palumbus migratorius", and was accompanied by the earliest published illustration of the species. Catesby's description was combined with the 1743 description of the mourning dove by <a href="George%20Edwards%20%28naturalist%29">George Edwards</a>, who used the name "C. macroura" for that bird. There is nothing to suggest Linnaeus ever saw specimens of these birds himself, and his description is thought to be fully derivative of these earlier accounts and their illustrations. In his 1766 edition of "Systema Naturae", Linnaeus dropped the name "C. macroura", and instead used the name "C. migratoria" for the passenger pigeon, and "C. carolinensis" for the mourning dove. In the same edition, Linnaeus also named "C. canadensis", based on "Turtur canadensis", as used by <a href="Mathurin%20Jacques%20Brisson">Mathurin Jacques Brisson</a> in 1760. Brisson's description was later shown to have been based on a female passenger pigeon.

In 1827 <a href="William%20John%20Swainson">William John Swainson</a> moved the passenger pigeon from the genus "Columba" to the new <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> genus "Ectopistes", due in part to the length of the wings and the wedge shape of the tail. In 1906 <a href="Outram%20Bangs">Outram Bangs</a> suggested that because Linnaeus had wholly copied Catesby's text when coining "C. macroura", this name should apply to the passenger pigeon, as "E. macroura". In 1918 <a href="Harry%20C.%20Oberholser">Harry C. Oberholser</a> suggested that "C. canadensis" should take precedence over "C. migratoria" (as "E. canadensis"), as it appeared on an earlier page in Linnaeus' book. In 1952 <a href="Francis%20Hemming">Francis Hemming</a> proposed that the <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature</a> (ICZN) secure the specific name "macroura" for the mourning dove, and the name "migratorius" for the passenger pigeon, since this was the intended use by the authors on whose work Linnaeus had based his description. This was accepted by the ICZN, which used its <a href="plenary%20powers">plenary powers</a> to designate the species for the respective names in 1955.

The passenger pigeon was a member of the pigeon and dove family, <a href="Columbidae">Columbidae</a>. Its closest living relatives were long thought to be the <a href="Zenaida%20doves">"Zenaida" doves</a>, based on morphological grounds, particularly the physically similar mourning dove (now "Z. macroura"). It was even suggested that the mourning dove belonged to the genus "Ectopistes" and was listed as "E. carolinensis" by some authors, including <a href="Thomas%20Mayo%20Brewer">Thomas Mayo Brewer</a>. The passenger pigeon was supposedly descended from "Zenaida" pigeons that had adapted to the woodlands on the plains of central North America.

The passenger pigeon differed from the species in the genus "Zenaida" in being larger, lacking a facial stripe, being <a href="sexually%20dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a>, and having <a href="iridescent">iridescent</a> neck feathers and a smaller <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a>. In a 2002 study by American geneticist <a href="Beth%20Shapiro">Beth Shapiro</a> et al., museum specimens of the passenger pigeon were included in an <a href="ancient%20DNA">ancient DNA</a> analysis for the first time (in a paper focusing mainly on the <a href="dodo">dodo</a>), and it was found to be the <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> of the cuckoo-dove genus "<a href="Macropygia">Macropygia</a>". The "Zenaida" doves were instead shown to be related to the <a href="quail-doves">quail-doves</a> of the genus "Geotrygon" and the "<a href="Leptotila">Leptotila</a>" doves.

A more extensive 2010 study instead showed that the passenger pigeon was most closely related to the New World "<a href="Patagioenas">Patagioenas</a>" pigeons, including the <a href="band-tailed%20pigeon">band-tailed pigeon</a> ("P. fasciata") of western North America, which are related to the Southeast Asian species in the genera "<a href="Turacoena">Turacoena</a>", "Macropygia" and "<a href="Reinwardtoena">Reinwardtoena</a>". This <a href="clade">clade</a> is also related to the "Columba" and "<a href="Streptopelia">Streptopelia</a>" doves of the Old World (collectively termed the "typical pigeons and doves"). The authors of the study suggested that the ancestors of the passenger pigeon may have colonized the New World from South East Asia by flying across the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, or perhaps across <a href="Beringia">Beringia</a> in the north.

In a 2012 study, the <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a> of the passenger pigeon was analyzed for the first time, and its relationship with the "Patagioenas" pigeons was confirmed. In contrast to the 2010 study, these authors suggested that their results could indicate that the ancestors of the passenger pigeon and its Old World relatives may have originated in the <a href="Neotropical%20region">Neotropical region</a> of the New World.

The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> below follows the 2012 DNA study showing the position of the passenger pigeon among its closest relatives:
DNA in old museum specimens is often degraded and fragmentary, and passenger pigeon specimens have been used in various studies to discover improved methods of analyzing and assembling genomes from such material. DNA samples are often taken from the toe pads of bird skins in museums, as this can be done without causing significant damage to valuable specimens. The passenger pigeon had no known subspecies. <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">Hybridization</a> occurred between the passenger pigeon and the <a href="Barbary%20dove">Barbary dove</a> ("Streptopelia risoria") in the aviary of <a href="Charles%20Otis%20Whitman">Charles Otis Whitman</a> (who owned many of the last captive birds around the turn of the 20th century, and kept them with other pigeon species) but the offspring were infertile.

The genus name, "Ectopistes", translates as "moving about" or "wandering", while the specific name, "migratorius", indicates its <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> habits. The full binomial can thus be translated as "migratory wanderer". The English common name "passenger pigeon" derives from the French word "passager", which means "to pass by" in a fleeting manner. While the pigeon was extant, the name passenger pigeon was used interchangeably with "wild pigeon". The bird also gained some less-frequently used names, including blue pigeon, merne rouck pigeon, wandering long-tailed dove, and wood pigeon. In the 18th century, the passenger pigeon was known as "tourte" in <a href="New%20France">New France</a> (in modern Canada), but to the French in Europe it was known as "tourtre". In modern French, the bird is known as "tourte voyageuse" or "pigeon migrateur", among other names.

In the Native American <a href="Algonquian%20languages">Algonquian languages</a>, the pigeon was called "amimi" by the <a href="Lenape%20language">Lenape</a>, "omiimii" by the <a href="Anishinaabe%20language">Ojibwe</a>, and "mimia" by the <a href="Kaskaskia">Kaskaskia</a> <a href="Miami-Illinois%20language">Illinois</a>. Other names in <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous American</a> languages include "ori'te" in <a href="Mohawk%20language">Mohawk</a>, and "putchee nashoba", or "lost dove", in <a href="Choctaw%20language">Choctaw</a>. The <a href="Seneca%20people">Seneca people</a> called the pigeon "jahgowa", meaning "big bread", as it was a source of food for their tribes. Chief <a href="Simon%20Pokagon">Simon Pokagon</a> of the <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a> stated that his people called the pigeon "O-me-me-wog", and that the Europeans did not adopt native names for the bird, as it reminded them of their domesticated pigeons, instead calling them "wild" pigeons, as they called the native peoples "wild" men.

The passenger pigeon was <a href="sexually%20dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a> in size and coloration. It weighed between . The adult male was about in length. It had a bluish-gray head, nape, and hindneck. On the sides of the neck and the upper mantle were iridescent display feathers that have variously been described as being a bright bronze, violet or golden-green, depending on the angle of the light. The upper back and wings were a pale or slate gray tinged with olive brown, that turned into grayish-brown on the lower wings. The lower back and <a href="Rump%20%28animal%29">rump</a> were a dark blue-gray that became grayish-brown on the upper tail-<a href="covert%20feather">covert feather</a>s. The greater and median wing-covert feathers were pale gray, with a small number of irregular black spots near the end. The primary and secondary feathers of the wing were a blackish-brown with a narrow white edge on the outer side of the secondaries. The two central tail feathers were brownish gray, and the rest were white.

The tail pattern was distinctive as it had white outer edges with blackish spots that were prominently displayed in flight. The lower throat and breast were richly pinkish-<a href="rufous">rufous</a>, grading into a paler pink further down, and into white on the abdomen and undertail covert feathers. The undertail coverts also had a few black spots. The bill was black, while the feet and legs were a bright coral red. It had a <a href="carmine">carmine</a>-red iris surrounded by a narrow purplish-red eye-ring. The wing of the male measured , the tail , the bill , and the <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> was .
The adult female passenger pigeon was slightly smaller than the male at in length. It was duller than the male overall, and was a grayish-brown on the forehead, crown, and nape down to the <a href="scapular">scapular</a>s, and the feathers on the sides of the neck had less <a href="iridescence">iridescence</a> than those of the male. The lower throat and breast were a buff-gray that developed into white on the belly and undertail-coverts. It was browner on the upperparts and paler buff brown and less rufous on the underparts than the male. The wings, back, and tail were similar in appearance to those of the male except that the outer edges of the primary feathers were edged in buff or rufous buff. The wings had more spotting than those of the male. The tail was shorter than that of the male, and the legs and feet were a paler red. The iris was orange red, with a grayish blue, naked orbital ring. The wing of the female was , the tail , the bill , and the tarsus was .

The juvenile passenger pigeon was similar in <a href="plumage">plumage</a> to the adult female, but lacked the spotting on the wings, and was a darker brownish-gray on the head, neck, and breast. The feathers on the wings had pale gray fringes (also described as white tips), giving it a scaled look. The secondaries were brownish-black with pale edges, and the <a href="tertial%20feathers">tertial feathers</a> had a rufous wash. The primaries were also edged with a rufous-brown color. The neck feathers had no iridescence. The legs and feet were dull red, and the iris was brownish, and surrounded by a narrow carmine ring. The plumage of the sexes was similar during their first year.

Of the hundreds of surviving skins, only one appears to be aberrant in coloran adult female from the collection of <a href="Walter%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a>, <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20at%20Tring">Natural History Museum at Tring</a>. It is a washed brown on the upper parts, wing covert, secondary feathers, and tail (where it would otherwise have been gray), and white on the primary feathers and underparts. The normally black spots are brown, and it is pale gray on the head, lower back, and upper-tail covert feathers, yet the iridescence is unaffected. The brown <a href="mutation">mutation</a> is a result of a reduction in <a href="eumelanin">eumelanin</a>, due to incomplete synthesis (<a href="oxidation">oxidation</a>) of this <a href="pigment">pigment</a>. This sex-linked mutation is common in female wild birds, but it is thought the white feathers of this specimen are instead the result of bleaching due to exposure to sunlight.

The passenger pigeon was physically adapted for speed, endurance, and maneuverability in flight, and has been described as having a streamlined version of the typical pigeon shape, such as that of the generalized <a href="rock%20dove">rock dove</a> ("Columba livia"). The wings were very long and pointed, and measured from the wing-chord to the primary feathers, and to the secondaries. The tail, which accounted for much of its overall length, was long and wedge-shaped (or graduated), with two central feathers longer than the rest. The body was slender and narrow, and the head and neck were small.

The internal anatomy of the passenger pigeon has rarely been described. <a href="Robert%20W.%20Shufeldt">Robert W. Shufeldt</a> found little to differentiate the bird's <a href="osteology">osteology</a> from that of other pigeons when examining a male skeleton in 1914, but <a href="Julian%20P.%20Hume">Julian P. Hume</a> noted several distinct features in a more detailed 2015 description. The pigeon had particularly large breast muscles that indicate powerful flight (<a href="musculus%20pectoralis%20major">musculus pectoralis major</a> for downstroke and the smaller <a href="Bird%20anatomy%23Muscular%20system">musculus supracoracoideus</a> for upstroke). The <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a> bone (which connects the <a href="scapula">scapula</a>, <a href="furcula">furcula</a>, and <a href="sternum">sternum</a>) was large relative to the size of the bird, , with straighter shafts and more robust articular ends than in other pigeons. The furcula had a sharper V-shape and was more robust, with expanded articular ends. The scapula was long, straight, and robust, and its <a href="distal">distal</a> end was enlarged. The sternum was very large and robust compared to that of other pigeons; its <a href="Keel%20%28bird%20anatomy%29">keel</a> was deep. The overlapping <a href="Uncinate%20processes%20of%20ribs">uncinate processes</a>, which stiffen the ribcage, were very well developed. The wing bones (<a href="humerus">humerus</a>, <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a>, <a href="ulna">ulna</a>, <a href="carpometacarpus">carpometacarpus</a>) were short but robust compared to other pigeons. The leg bones were similar to those of other pigeons.

The noise produced by flocks of passenger pigeons was described as deafening, audible for miles away, and the bird's voice as loud, harsh, and unmusical. It was also described by some as clucks, twittering, and cooing, and as a series of low notes instead of actual song. The birds apparently made croaking noises when building nests, and bell-like sounds when mating. During feeding, some individuals would give <a href="alarm%20calls">alarm calls</a> when facing a threat, and the rest of the flock would join the sound while taking off.

In 1911 American behavioral scientist <a href="Wallace%20Craig">Wallace Craig</a> published an account of the gestures and sounds of this species as a series of descriptions and <a href="musical%20notations">musical notations</a>, based on observation of C. O. Whitman's captive passenger pigeons in 1903. Craig compiled these records to assist in identifying potential survivors in the wild (as the physically similar mourning doves could otherwise be mistaken for passenger pigeons), while noting this "meager information" was likely all that would be left on the subject. According to Craig, one call was a simple harsh "keck" that could be given twice in succession with a pause in between. This was said to be used to attract the attention of another pigeon. Another call was a more frequent and variable scolding. This sound was described as "kee-kee-kee-kee" or "tete! tete! tete!", and was used to call either to its mate or towards other creatures it considered to be enemies. One variant of this call, described as a long, drawn-out "tweet", could be used to call down a flock of passenger pigeons passing overhead, which would then land in a nearby tree. "Keeho" was a soft cooing that, while followed by louder "keck" notes or scolding, was directed at the bird's mate. A nesting passenger pigeon would also give off a stream of at least eight mixed notes that were both high and low in tone and ended with "keeho". Overall, female passenger pigeons were quieter and called infrequently. Craig suggested that the loud, strident voice and "degenerated" musicality was the result of living in populous colonies where only the loudest sounds could be heard.

The passenger pigeon was found across most of North America east of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, from the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> to the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Atlantic coast</a> in the east, to the south of Canada in the north, and the north of Mississippi in the southern United States, coinciding with its primary habitat, the eastern <a href="Temperate%20deciduous%20forest">deciduous forests</a>. Within this range, it constantly migrated in search of food and shelter. It is unclear if the birds favored particular trees and terrain, but they were possibly not restricted to one type, as long as their numbers could be supported. It originally bred from the southern parts of eastern and central Canada south to eastern Kansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Georgia in the United States, but the primary breeding range was in southern Ontario and the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> states south through states north of the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>. Though the western forests were ecologically similar to those in the east, these were occupied by band-tailed pigeons, which may have kept out the passenger pigeons through <a href="competitive%20exclusion">competitive exclusion</a>.

The passenger pigeon wintered from Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina south to Texas, the Gulf Coast, and northern Florida, though flocks occasionally wintered as far north as southern Pennsylvania and Connecticut. It preferred to winter in large swamps, particularly those with <a href="alder">alder</a> trees; if swamps were not available, forested areas, particularly with <a href="pine">pine</a> trees, were favored roosting sites. There were also sightings of passenger pigeons outside of its normal range, including in several Western states, <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, and <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, particularly during severe winters. It has been suggested that some of these extralimital records may be considered as such more on the basis of the paucity of observers in what was then unsettled country than on the actual extent of wandering passenger pigeons, and that the bird may have appeared anywhere on the continent except for the far west. There were also records of stragglers in Scotland, Ireland, and France, although these birds may have been escaped captives, or the records incorrect.

More than 130 passenger pigeon fossils have been found scattered across 25 US states, including in the <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a> of California. These records date as far back as 100,000 years ago in the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> era, during which the pigeon's range extended to several western states that were not a part of its modern range. The abundance of the species in these regions and during this time is unknown.

The passenger pigeon was <a href="nomad">nomad</a>ic, constantly migrating in search of food, shelter, or nesting grounds. In his 1831 "Ornithological Biography", American naturalist and artist <a href="John%20James%20Audubon">John James Audubon</a> described a migration he observed in 1813 as follows:
These flocks were frequently described as being so dense that they blackened the sky and as having no sign of subdivisions. The flocks ranged from only above the ground in windy conditions to as high as . These migrating flocks were typically in narrow columns that twisted and undulated, and they were reported as being in nearly every conceivable shape. A skilled flyer, the passenger pigeon is estimated to have averaged during migration. It flew with quick, repeated flaps that increased the bird's velocity the closer the wings got to the body. It was equally as adept and quick at flying through a forest as through open space. A flock was also adept at following the lead of the pigeon in front of it, and flocks swerved together to avoid a predator. When landing, the pigeon flapped its wings repeatedly before raising them at the moment of landing. The pigeon was awkward when on the ground, and moved around with jerky, alert steps.

The passenger pigeon was one of the most social of all land birds. Estimated to have numbered three to five billion at the height of its population, it may have been the most numerous bird on Earth; researcher <a href="Arlie%20W.%20Schorger">Arlie W. Schorger</a> believed that it accounted for between 25 and 40 percent of the total land bird population in the United States. The passenger pigeon's historic population is roughly the equivalent of the number of birds that overwinter in the United States every year in the early 21st century. Even within their range, the size of individual flocks could vary greatly. In November 1859, <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>, writing in <a href="Concord%2C%20Massachusetts">Concord, Massachusetts</a>, noted that “quite a little flock of [passenger] pigeons bred here last summer,” while only seven years later, in 1866, one flock in southern <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> was described as being wide and long, took 14 hours to pass, and held in excess of 3.5 billion birds. Such a number would likely represent a large fraction of the entire population at the time, or perhaps all of it. Most estimations of numbers were based on single migrating colonies, and it is unknown how many of these existed at a given time. American writer <a href="Christopher%20Cokinos">Christopher Cokinos</a> has suggested that if the birds flew single file, they would have stretched around the earth 22 times.

A 2014 genetic study (based on <a href="coalescent%20theory">coalescent theory</a> and on “sequences from most of the <a href="genome">genome</a>” of three individual passenger pigeons) suggested that the passenger pigeon population experienced dramatic fluctuations across the last million years, due to their dependence on availability of <a href="Mast%20%28botany%29">mast</a> (which itself fluctuates). The study suggested the bird was not always abundant, mainly persisting at around 1/10,000 the amount of the several billions estimated in the 1800s, with vastly larger numbers present during outbreak phases. Some early accounts also suggest that the appearance of flocks in great numbers was an irregular occurrence. These large fluctuations in population may have been the result of a disrupted ecosystem and have consisted of outbreak populations much larger than those common in pre-European times. The authors of the 2014 genetic study note that a similar analysis of the human population size arrives at an “<a href="effective%20population%20size">effective population size</a>” of between 9,000 and 17,000 individuals (or approximately 1/550,000th of the peak total human population size of 7 billion cited in the study).

For a 2017 genetic study, the authors sequenced the <a href="genome">genome</a>s of two additional passenger pigeons, as well as analyzing the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> of 41 individuals. This study found evidence that the passenger-pigeon population had been stable for at least the previous 20,000 years . The study also found that the size of the passenger pigeon population over that time period had been larger than the 2014 genetic study had found. However, the 2017 study’s “conservative” estimate of an “<a href="effective%20population%20size">effective population size</a>” of 13 million birds is still only about 1/300th of the bird’s estimated historic population of approximately 3-5 billion before their “19th century decline and eventual extinction.” A similar study inferring human population size from genetics (published in 2008, and using human mitochondrial DNA and <a href="Bayesian%20inference">Bayesian</a> <a href="Coalescent%20theory">coalescent</a> inference methods) showed considerable accuracy in reflecting overall patterns of human population growth as compared to data deduced by other means — though the study arrived at a human <a href="effective%20population%20size">effective population size</a> (as of 1600 AD, for Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas combined) that was roughly 1/1000 of the census population estimate for the same time and area based on anthropological and historical evidence.

The 2017 passenger-pigeon genetic study also found that, in spite of its large population size, the genetic diversity was very low in the species. The authors suggested that this was a side-effect of <a href="Natural%20selection">natural selection</a>, which theory and previous empirical studies suggested could have a particular great impact on species with very large and cohesive populations. Natural selection can reduce genetic diversity over extended regions of a genome through '<a href="Selective%20sweep">selective sweeps</a>' or '<a href="Background%20selection">background selection</a>'. The authors found evidence of a faster rate of <a href="Adaptation">adaptive evolution</a> and faster removal of harmful mutations in passenger pigeons compared to <a href="Band-tailed%20pigeon">band-tailed pigeons</a>, which are some of passenger pigeons' closest living relatives. They also found evidence of lower genetic diversity in regions of the passenger pigeon genome that have lower rates of <a href="Genetic%20recombination">genetic recombination</a>. This is expected if natural selection, via <a href="Selective%20sweep">selective sweeps</a> or <a href="Background%20selection">background selection</a>, reduced their genetic diversity, but not if population instability did. The study concluded that earlier suggestion that population instability contributed to the extinction of the species was invalid. Evolutionary biologist A. Townsend Peterson said of the two passenger-pigeon genetic studies (published in 2014 and 2017) that, though the idea of extreme fluctuations in the passenger-pigeon population was “deeply entrenched,” he was persuaded by the 2017 study’s argument, due to its “in-depth analysis” and “massive data resources.”
A <a href="communally%20roosting">communally roosting</a> species, the passenger pigeon chose roosting sites that could provide shelter and enough food to sustain their large numbers for an indefinite period. The time spent at one roosting site may have depended on the extent of human persecution, weather conditions, or other, unknown factors. Roosts ranged in size and extent, from a few acres to or greater. Some roosting areas would be reused for subsequent years, others would only be used once. The passenger pigeon roosted in such numbers that even thick tree branches would break under the strain. The birds frequently piled on top of each other's backs to roost. They rested in a slumped position that hid their feet. They slept with their bills concealed by the feathers in the middle of the breast while holding their tail at a 45-degree angle. Dung could accumulate under a roosting site to a depth of over .
If the pigeon became alert, it would often stretch out its head and neck in line with its body and tail, then nod its head in a circular pattern. When aggravated by another pigeon, it raised its wings threateningly, but passenger pigeons almost never actually fought. The pigeon bathed in shallow water, and afterwards lay on each side in turn and raised the opposite wing to dry it.

The passenger pigeon drank at least once a day, typically at dawn, by fully inserting its bill into lakes, small ponds, and streams. Pigeons were seen perching on top of each other to access water, and if necessary, the species could alight on open water to drink. One of the primary causes of natural mortality was the weather, and every spring many individuals froze to death after migrating north too early. In captivity, a passenger pigeon was capable of living at least 15 years; <a href="Martha%20%28pigeon%29">Martha</a>, the last known living passenger pigeon, was at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died. It is undocumented how long a wild pigeon lived.

The bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of <a href="Pre-Columbian%20era">pre-Columbian</a> forests of eastern North America. For instance, while the passenger pigeon was extant, forests were dominated by <a href="Quercus%20alba">white oaks</a>. This species germinated in the fall, therefore making its seeds almost useless as a food source during the spring breeding season, while <a href="Quercus%20rubra">red oaks</a> produced acorns during the spring, which were devoured by the pigeons. The absence of the passenger pigeon's seed consumption may have contributed to the modern dominance of red oaks. Due to the immense amount of dung present at roosting sites, few plants grew for years after the pigeons left. Also, the accumulation of flammable debris (such as limbs broken from trees and foliage killed by excrement) at these sites may have increased both the frequency and intensity of <a href="wildfire">forest fires</a>, which would have favored <a href="Fire%20ecology%23Fire%20tolerance">fire-tolerant species</a>, such as <a href="Quercus%20macrocarpa">bur oaks</a>, <a href="Quercus%20velutina">black oaks</a>, and <a href="Quercus%20alba">white oaks</a> over less fire-tolerant species, such as red oaks, thus helping to explain the change in the composition of eastern forests since the passenger pigeon’s extinction (from white oaks, bur oaks, and black oaks predominating in presettlement forests, to the “dramatic expansion” of red oaks today).

A study released in 2018 concluded that the “vast numbers” of passenger pigeons present for “tens of thousands of years” would have influenced the evolution of the tree species that they ate the seeds of — specifically, that masting trees that produced seeds during the spring nesting season (such as red oaks) evolved so that some portion of their seeds would be too large for passenger pigeons to swallow (thus allowing some of their seeds to escape predation and grow new trees), while white oaks, with its seeds sized consistently in the edible range, evolved an irregular masting pattern that took place in the fall, when fewer passenger pigeons would have been present. The study further concluded that this allowed white oaks to be the dominant tree species in regions where passenger pigeons were commonly present in the spring.

With the large numbers in passenger pigeon flocks, the excrement they produced was enough to destroy surface-level vegetation at long-term roosting sites, while adding high quantities of nutrients to the <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. Because of this — along with the breaking of tree limbs under their collective weight and the great amount of <a href="Mast%20%28botany%29">mast</a> they consumed — passenger pigeons are thought to have influenced both the structure of eastern forests and the composition of the species present there. Due to these influences, some ecologists have considered the passenger pigeon a <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a>, with the disappearance of their vast flocks leaving a major gap in the ecosystem. Their role in creating <a href="Forest%20dynamics">forest disturbances</a> has been linked to greater vertebrate diversity in forests by creating more niches for animals to fill, as well as contributing to a healthy forest fire cycle in the forests, as it has been found that forest fires have increased in prevalence since the extinction of the passenger pigeon, which seems to go against the idea that the tree limbs and branches they would bring down served as fuel for the fires. To help fill that ecological gap, it has been proposed that modern land managers attempt to replicate some of their effects on the ecosystem by creating openings in forest <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopies</a> to provide more <a href="understory">understory</a> light.

The <a href="American%20chestnut">American chestnut</a> trees that provided much of the <a href="Mast%20%28botany%29">mast</a> on which the passenger pigeon fed was itself almost driven to extinction by an imported Asian fungus (<a href="chestnut%20blight">chestnut blight</a>) around 1905. As many as thirty billion trees are thought to have died as a result in the following decades, but this did not affect the passenger pigeon, which was already extinct in the wild at the time.

After the disappearance of the passenger pigeon, the population of another acorn feeding species, the <a href="white-footed%20mouse">white-footed mouse</a>, grew exponentially because of the increased availability of the seeds of the oak, beech and chestnut trees. It has been speculated that the extinction of passenger pigeons may have increased the prevalence of tick-borne <a href="lyme%20disease">lyme disease</a> in modern times as white-footed mice are the <a href="Natural%20reservoir">reservoir hosts</a> of "<a href="Borrelia%20burgdorferi">Borrelia burgdorferi</a>".

<a href="Beech">Beech</a>es and <a href="oak">oak</a>s produced the <a href="Mast%20%28botany%29">mast</a> needed to support nesting and roosting flocks. The passenger pigeon changed its diet depending on the season. In the fall, winter, and spring, it mainly ate beechnuts, <a href="acorn">acorn</a>s, and chestnuts. During the summer, berries and softer fruits, such as <a href="Blueberry">blueberries</a>, <a href="grape">grape</a>s, <a href="Prunus">cherries</a>, <a href="Morus%20rubra">mulberries</a>, <a href="Phytolacca%20americana">pokeberries</a>, and <a href="Cornus%20canadensis">bunchberry</a>, became the main objects of its consumption. It also ate <a href="Oligochaeta">worms</a>, <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s, <a href="snail">snail</a>s, and other invertebrates, particularly while breeding. It took advantage of cultivated grains, particularly <a href="buckwheat">buckwheat</a>, when it found them. It was especially fond of <a href="salt">salt</a>, which it ingested either from brackish springs or salty soil.

Mast occurs in large quantities in different places at different times, and rarely in consecutive years, which is one of the reasons why the large flocks were constantly on the move. As mast is produced during autumn, there would have to be a large amount of it left by the summer, when the young were reared. It is unknown how they located this fluctuating food source, but their eyesight and flight powers helped them survey large areas for places that could provide food enough for a temporary stay.
The passenger pigeon foraged in flocks of tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals that overturned leaves, dirt, and snow with their bills in search of food. One observer described the motion of such a flock in search of mast as having a rolling appearance, as birds in the back of the flock flew overhead to the front of the flock, dropping leaves and grass in flight. The flocks had wide leading edges to better scan the landscape for food sources.

When nuts on a tree loosened from their caps, a pigeon would land on a branch and, while flapping vigorously to stay balanced, grab the nut, pull it loose from its cap, and swallow it whole. Collectively, a foraging flock was capable of removing nearly all fruits and nuts from their path. Birds in the back of the flock flew to the front in order to pick over unsearched ground; however, birds never ventured far from the flock and hurried back if they became isolated. It is believed that the pigeons used social cues to identify abundant sources of food, and a flock of pigeons that saw others feeding on the ground often joined them. During the day, the birds left the roosting forest to forage on more open land. They regularly flew away from their roost daily in search of food, and some pigeons reportedly traveled as far as , leaving the roosting area early and returning at night.

The passenger pigeon had a very elastic mouth and throat, allowing for increased capacity, and a joint in the lower bill enabled it to swallow acorns whole. It could store large quantities of food in its <a href="Crop%20%28anatomy%29%23Birds">crop</a>, which could expand to about the size of an orange, causing the neck to bulge and allowing a bird quickly to grab any food it discovered. The crop was described as being capable of holding at least 17 acorns or 28 beechnuts, 11 grains of corn, 100 maple seeds, plus other material; it was estimated that a passenger pigeon needed to eat about of food a day to survive. If shot, a pigeon with a crop full of nuts would fall to the ground with a sound described as like the rattle of a bag of marbles. After feeding, the pigeons perched on branches and digested the food stored in their crop overnight.

The pigeon could eat and digest of acorns per day. At the historic population of three billion passenger pigeons, this amounted to of food a day. The pigeon could regurgitate food from its crop when more desirable food became available. A 2018 study found that the dietary range of the passenger pigeon was restricted to certain sizes of seed, due to the size of its gape. This would have prevented it from eating some of the seeds of trees such as <a href="red%20oaks">red oaks</a>, the <a href="Quercus%20velutina">black oak</a>, and the <a href="American%20chestnut">American chestnut</a>. Specifically, the study found that between 13% and 69% of red oak seeds were too large for passenger pigeons to have swallowed, that only a “small proportion” of the seeds of black oaks and American chestnuts were too large for the birds to consume, and that all white oak seeds were sized within an edible range. They also found that seeds would be completely destroyed during digestion, which therefore hindered dispersal of seeds this way. Instead, passenger pigeons may have spread seeds by <a href="Regurgitation%20%28digestion%29">regurgitation</a>, or after dying.

Other than finding roosting sites, the migrations of the passenger pigeon were connected with finding places appropriate for this <a href="communally%20breeding">communally breeding</a> bird to nest and raise its young. It is not certain how many times a year the birds bred; once seems most likely, but some accounts suggest more. The nesting period lasted around four to six weeks. The flock arrived at a nesting ground around March in southern latitudes, and some time later in more northern areas. The pigeon had no site fidelity, often choosing to nest in a different location each year. The formation of a nesting colony did not necessarily take place until several months after the pigeons arrived on their breeding grounds, typically during late March, April, or May.

The colonies, which were known as "cities", were immense, ranging from to thousands of hectares in size, and were often long and narrow in shape (L-shaped), with a few areas untouched for unknown reasons. Due to the topography, they were rarely continuous. Since no accurate data was recorded, it is not possible to give more than estimates on the size and population of these nesting areas, but most accounts mention colonies containing millions of birds. The largest nesting area ever recorded was in central Wisconsin in 1871; it was reported as covering , with the number of birds nesting there estimated to be around 136,000,000. As well as these "cities", there were regular reports of much smaller flocks or even individual pairs setting up a nesting site. The birds do not seem to have formed as vast breeding colonies at the periphery of their range.

Courtship took place at the nesting colony. Unlike other pigeons, courtship took place on a branch or perch. The male, with a flourish of the wings, made a "keck" call while near a female. The male then gripped tightly to the branch and vigorously flapped his wings up and down. When the male was close to the female, he then pressed against her on the perch with his head held high and pointing at her. If receptive, the female pressed back against the male. When ready to mate, the pair <a href="Social%20grooming">preened</a> each other. This was followed by the birds <a href="Beak%23Billing">billing</a>, in which the female inserted its <a href="beak">bill</a> into and clasped the male's bill, shook for a second, and separated quickly while standing next to each other. The male then scrambled onto the female's back and copulated, which was then followed by soft clucking and occasionally more preening. John James Audubon described the courtship of the passenger pigeon as follows:
After observing captive birds, Wallace Craig found that this species did less charging and strutting than other pigeons (as it was awkward on the ground), and thought it probable that no food was transferred during their brief billing (unlike in other pigeons), and he therefore considered Audubon's description partially based on analogy with other pigeons as well as imagination.

Nests were built immediately after pair formation and took two to four days to construct; this process was highly synchronized within a colony. The female chose the nesting site by sitting on it and flicking its wings. The male then carefully selected nesting materials, typically twigs, and handed them to the female over her back. The male then went in search of more nesting material while the female constructed the nest beneath herself. Nests were built between above the ground, though typically above , and were made of 70 to 110 twigs woven together to create a loose, shallow bowl through which the egg could easily be seen. This bowl was then typically lined with finer twigs. The nests were about wide, high, and deep. Though the nest has been described as crude and flimsy compared to those of many other birds, remains of nests could be found at sites where nesting had taken place several years prior. Nearly every tree capable of supporting nests had them, often more than 50 per tree; one hemlock was recorded as holding 317 nests. The nests were placed on strong branches close to the tree trunks. Some accounts state that ground under the nesting area looked as if it had been swept clean, due to all the twigs being collected at the same time, yet this area would also have been covered in dung. As both sexes took care of the nest, the pairs were <a href="Monogamy">monogamous</a> for the duration of the nesting.

Generally, the eggs were laid during the first two weeks of April across the pigeon's range. Each female laid its egg immediately or almost immediately after the nest was completed; sometimes the pigeon was forced to lay it on the ground if the nest was not complete. The normal clutch size appears to have been a single egg, but there is some uncertainty about this, as two have also been reported from the same nests. Occasionally, a second female laid its egg in another female's nest, resulting in two eggs being present. The egg was white and oval shaped and averaged in size. If the egg was lost, it was possible for the pigeon to lay a replacement egg within a week. A whole colony was known to re-nest after a snowstorm forced them to abandon their original colony. The egg was <a href="Egg%20incubation">incubated</a> by both parents for 12 to 14 days, with the male incubating it from midmorning to midafternoon and the female incubating it for the rest of the time.

Upon hatching, the nestling (or squab) was blind and sparsely covered with yellow, hairlike <a href="Down%20feather">down</a>. The nestling developed quickly and within 14 days weighed as much as its parents. During this brooding period both parents took care of the nestling, with the male attending in the middle of the day and the female at other times. The nestlings were fed <a href="crop%20milk">crop milk</a> (a substance similar to <a href="curd">curd</a>, produced in the crops of the parent birds) exclusively for the first days after hatching. Adult food was gradually introduced after three to six days. After 13 to 15 days, the parents fed the nestling for a last time and then abandoned it, leaving the nesting area "en masse". The nestling begged in the nest for a day or two, before climbing from the nest and fluttering to the ground, whereafter it moved around, avoided obstacles, and begged for food from nearby adults. It was another three or four days before it fledged. The entire nesting cycle lasted about 30 days. It is unknown whether colonies re-nested after a successful nesting. The passenger pigeon sexually matured during its first year and bred the following spring.

Nesting colonies attracted large numbers of predators, including <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a>s, <a href="American%20weasel">American weasel</a>s, <a href="American%20marten">American marten</a>s, and <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s that preyed on eggs and nestlings, <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, such as <a href="owl">owl</a>s, <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s, and <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s that preyed on nestlings and adults, and <a href="Gray%20wolf">wolves</a>, <a href="fox">fox</a>es, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s, <a href="bear">bear</a>s, and <a href="mountain%20lion">mountain lion</a>s that preyed on injured adults and fallen nestlings. Hawks of the genus "<a href="Accipiter">Accipiter</a>" and falcons pursued and preyed upon pigeons in flight, which in turn executed complex aerial maneuvers to avoid them; <a href="Cooper%27s%20hawk">Cooper's hawk</a> was known as the "great pigeon hawk" due to its successes, and these hawks allegedly followed migrating passenger pigeons. While many predators were drawn to the flocks, individual pigeons were largely protected due to the sheer size of the flock, and overall little damage could be inflicted on the flock by predation. Despite the number of predators, nesting colonies were so large that they were estimated to have a 90% success rate if not disturbed. After being abandoned and leaving the nest, the very fat juveniles were vulnerable to predators until they were able to fly. The sheer number of juveniles on the ground meant that only a small percentage of them were killed; <a href="predator%20satiation">predator satiation</a> may therefore be one of the reasons for the extremely social habits and communal breeding of the species.

Two parasites have been recorded on passenger pigeons. One species of <a href="Philopteridae">phtilopterid</a> <a href="louse">louse</a>, "<a href="Columbicola%20extinctus">Columbicola extinctus</a>", was originally thought to have lived on just passenger pigeons and to have become <a href="coextinct">coextinct</a> with them. This was proven inaccurate in 1999 when "C. extinctus" was rediscovered living on band-tailed pigeons. This, and the fact that the related louse "C. angustus" is mainly found on cuckoo-doves, further supports the relation between these pigeons, as the phylogeny of lice broadly mirrors that of their hosts. Another louse, "<a href="Campanulotes">Campanulotes defectus</a>", was thought to have been unique to the passenger pigeon, but is now believed to have been a case of a contaminated specimen, as the species is considered to be the still-extant "<a href="Campanulotes">Campanulotes flavus</a>" of Australia. There is no record of a wild pigeon dying of either disease or parasites.

For fifteen-thousand years or more before the arrival of Europeans in the Americas, passenger pigeons and Native Americans coexisted in the forests of what would later become the eastern part of the continental United States. A study published in 2008 found that, throughout most of the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>, Native American land-use practices greatly influenced forest composition. The regular use of <a href="controlled%20burn">prescribed fire</a>, the <a href="girdling">girdling</a> of unwanted trees, and the planting and tending of favored trees suppressed the populations of a number of tree species that did not produce nuts, acorns, or fruit, while increasing the populations of numerous tree species that did. In addition, the burning away of forest-floor litter made these foods easier to find, once they had fallen from the trees. Some have argued that such Native American land-use practices increased the populations of various animal species, including the passenger pigeon, by increasing the food available to them, while elsewhere it has been claimed that, by hunting passenger pigeons and competing with them for some kinds of nuts and acorns, Native Americans suppressed their population size. Genetic research may shed some light on this question. A 2017 study of passenger-pigeon DNA found that the passenger-pigeon population size had been stable for 20,000 years prior to its 19th-century decline and subsequent extinction, while a 2016 study of ancient Native-American DNA found that the Native-American population went through a period of rapid expansion, increasing 60-fold, starting about 13-16 thousand years ago. If both of these studies are correct, then a great change in the size of the Native-American population had no apparent impact on the size of the passenger-pigeon population. This suggests that the net effect of Native-American activities on passenger-pigeon population size was neutral.

The passenger pigeon played a religious role for some northern Native American tribes. The <a href="Wyandot%20people">Wyandot people</a> (or Huron) believed that every twelve years during the <a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Dead">Feast of the Dead</a>, the souls of the dead changed into passenger pigeons, which were then hunted and eaten. Before hunting the juvenile pigeons, the Seneca people made an offering of <a href="wampum">wampum</a> and brooches to the old passenger pigeons; these were placed in a small kettle or other receptacle by a smoky fire. The <a href="Ho-Chunk">Ho-Chunk</a> people considered the passenger pigeon to be the bird of the chief, as they were served whenever the chieftain gave a feast. The Seneca people believed that a white pigeon was the chief of the passenger pigeon colony, and that a Council of Birds had decided that the pigeons had to give their bodies to the Seneca because they were the only birds that nested in colonies. The Seneca developed a pigeon dance as a way of showing their gratitude.

French explorer <a href="Jacques%20Cartier">Jacques Cartier</a> was the first European to report on passenger pigeons, during his voyage in 1534. The bird was subsequently observed and noted by historical figures such as <a href="Samuel%20de%20Champlain">Samuel de Champlain</a> and <a href="Cotton%20Mather">Cotton Mather</a>. Most early accounts dwell on the vast number of pigeons, the resulting darkened skies, and the enormous amount of hunted birds (50,000 birds were reportedly sold at a Boston market in 1771). The early colonists thought that large flights of pigeons would be followed by ill fortune or sickness. When the pigeons wintered outside of their normal range, some believed that they would have "a sickly summer and autumn." In the 18th and 19th centuries, various parts of the pigeon were thought to have medicinal properties. The blood was supposed to be good for eye disorders, the powdered stomach lining was used to treat <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, and the dung was used to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches, stomach pains, and lethargy. Though they did not last as long as the feathers of a goose, the feathers of the passenger pigeon were frequently used for bedding. Pigeon feather beds were so popular that for a time in <a href="Saint-J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%2C%20Quebec">Saint-Jérôme, Quebec</a>, every dowry included a bed and pillows made of pigeon feathers. In 1822, one family in <a href="Chautauqua%20County%2C%20New%20York">Chautauqua County, New York</a>, killed 4,000 pigeons in a day solely for this purpose.

The passenger pigeon was featured in the writings of many significant early naturalists, as well as accompanying illustrations. Mark Catesby's 1731 illustration, the first published depiction of this bird, is somewhat crude, according to some later commentators. The original watercolor that the engraving is based on was bought by the British royal family in 1768, along with the rest of Catesby's watercolors. The naturalists <a href="Alexander%20Wilson%20%28ornithologist%29">Alexander Wilson</a> and John James Audubon both witnessed large pigeon migrations first hand, and published detailed accounts wherein both attempted to deduce the total number of birds involved. The most famous and often reproduced depiction of the passenger pigeon is Audubon's illustration (handcolored <a href="aquatint">aquatint</a>) in his book "<a href="The%20Birds%20of%20America">The Birds of America</a>", published between 1827 and 1838. Audubon's image has been praised for its artistic qualities, but criticized for its supposed scientific inaccuracies. As Wallace Craig and R. W. Shufeldt (among others) pointed out, the birds are shown perched and billing one above the other, whereas they would instead have done this side by side, the male would be the one passing food to the female, and the male's tail would not be spread. Craig and Shufeldt instead cited illustrations by American artist <a href="Louis%20Agassiz%20Fuertes">Louis Agassiz Fuertes</a> and Japanese artist K. Hayashi as more accurate depictions of the bird. Illustrations of the passenger pigeon were often drawn after stuffed birds, and <a href="Charles%20R.%20Knight">Charles R. Knight</a> is the only "serious" artist known to have drawn the species from life. He did so on at least two occasions; in 1903 he drew a bird possibly in one of the three aviaries with surviving birds, and some time before 1914, he drew Martha, the last individual, in the <a href="Cincinnati%20Zoo">Cincinnati Zoo</a>.

The bird has been written about (including in poems, songs, and fiction) and illustrated by many notable writers and artists, and is depicted in art to this day, for example in <a href="Walton%20Ford">Walton Ford</a>'s 2002 painting "Falling Bough", and <a href="National%20Medal%20of%20Arts">National Medal of Arts</a> winner <a href="John%20A.%20Ruthven">John A. Ruthven</a>'s 2014 mural in Cincinnati, which commemorates the 100th anniversary of Martha's death. The centennial of its extinction was used by the "Project Passenger Pigeon" outreach group to spread awareness about human-induced extinction, and to recognize its relevance in the 21st century. It has been suggested that the passenger pigeon could be used as a "<a href="flagship">flagship</a>" species to spread awareness of other threatened, but less well-known North American birds.

The passenger pigeon was an important source of food for the people of North America. The indigenous peoples ate pigeons, and tribes near nesting colonies would sometimes move to live closer to them and eat the juveniles, killing them at night with long poles. Many Native Americans were careful not to disturb the adult pigeons, and instead ate only the juveniles as they were afraid that the adults might desert their nesting grounds; in some tribes, disturbing the adult pigeons was considered a crime. Away from the nests, large nets were used to capture adult pigeons, sometimes up to 800 at a time. Low-flying pigeons could be killed by throwing sticks or stones. At one site in <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, the pigeons leaving their roost every morning flew low enough that the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> could throw clubs into their midst, which caused the lead pigeons to try to turn aside and in the process created a blockade that resulted in a large mass of flying, easily hit pigeons. Among the game birds, passenger pigeons were second only to the <a href="wild%20turkey">wild turkey</a> ("Meleagris gallopavo") in terms of importance for the Native Americans living in the southeastern United States. The bird's fat was stored, often in large quantities, and used as butter. Archaeological evidence supports the idea that Native Americans ate the pigeons frequently prior to colonization.

What may be the earliest account of Europeans hunting passenger pigeons dates to January 1565, when the French explorer <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Goulaine%20de%20Laudonni%C3%A8re">René Laudonnière</a> wrote of killing close to 10,000 of them around <a href="Fort%20Caroline%23Fort%20Caroline%20%281564%E2%80%931565%29">Fort Caroline</a> in a matter of weeks: There came to us a <a href="manna">manna</a> of wood pigeons in such great numbers, that over a span of about seven weeks, each day we killed more than two hundred with <a href="arquebus">arquebus</a>es in the woods around our fort.
This amounted to about one passenger pigeon per day for each person in the fort.
After European colonization, the passenger pigeon was hunted more intensively and with more sophisticated methods than the more <a href="sustainability">sustainable</a> methods practiced by the natives. Yet it has also been suggested that the species was rare prior to 1492, and that the subsequent increase in their numbers may be due to the decrease in the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> population (who, as well as hunting the birds, competed with them for mast) caused by European immigration, and the supplementary food (agricultural crops) the immigrants imported (a theory for which Joel Greenberg offered a detailed rebuttal in his book, "A Feathered River Across the Sky"). The passenger pigeon was of particular value on the frontier, and some settlements counted on its meat to support their population. The flavor of the flesh of passenger pigeons varied depending on how they were prepared. In general, juveniles were thought to taste the best, followed by birds fattened in captivity and birds caught in September and October. It was common practice to fatten trapped pigeons before eating them or storing their bodies for winter. Dead pigeons were commonly stored by <a href="Salting%20%28food%29">salting</a> or <a href="pickling">pickling</a> the bodies; other times, only the breasts of the pigeons were kept, in which case they were typically <a href="Smoking%20%28cooking%29">smoked</a>. In the early 19th century, commercial hunters began netting and shooting the birds to sell as food in city markets, and even as pig <a href="fodder">fodder</a>. Once pigeon meat became popular, commercial hunting started on a prodigious scale.

Passenger pigeons were shot with such ease that many did not consider them to be a game bird, as an amateur hunter could easily bring down six with one shotgun blast; a particularly good shot with both barrels of a shotgun at a roost could kill 61 birds. The birds were frequently shot either in flight during migration or immediately after, when they commonly perched in dead, exposed trees. Hunters only had to shoot toward the sky without aiming, and many pigeons would be brought down. The pigeons proved difficult to shoot head-on, so hunters typically waited for the flocks to pass overhead before shooting them. Trenches were sometimes dug and filled with grain so that a hunter could shoot the pigeons along this trench. Hunters largely outnumbered trappers, and hunting passenger pigeons was a popular sport for young boys. In 1871, a single seller of ammunition provided three tons of powder and 16 tons (32,000 lb) of shot during a nesting. In the latter half of the 19th century, thousands of passenger pigeons were captured for use in the <a href="sports%20shooting">sports shooting</a> industry. The pigeons were used as living targets in shooting tournaments, such as "<a href="trap-shooting">trap-shooting</a>", the controlled release of birds from special traps. Competitions could also consist of people standing regularly spaced while trying to shoot down as many birds as possible in a passing flock. The pigeon was considered so numerous that 30,000 birds had to be killed to claim the prize in one competition.

There were a wide variety of other methods used to capture and kill passenger pigeons. Nets were propped up to allow passenger pigeons entry, then closed by knocking loose the stick that supported the opening, trapping twenty or more pigeons inside. Tunnel nets were also used to great effect, and one particularly large net was capable of catching 3,500 pigeons at a time. These nets were used by many farmers on their own property as well as by professional trappers. Food would be placed on the ground near the nets to attract the pigeons. <a href="Decoy">Decoy</a> or "stool pigeons" (sometimes blinded by having their eyelids sewn together) were tied to a stool. When a flock of pigeons passed by, a cord would be pulled that made the stool pigeon flutter to the ground, making it seem as if it had found food, and the flock would be lured into the trap. Salt was also frequently used as bait, and many trappers set up near salt springs. At least one trapper used alcohol-soaked grain as bait to intoxicate the birds and make them easier to kill. Another method of capture was to hunt at a nesting colony, particularly during the period of a few days after the adult pigeons abandoned their nestlings, but before the nestlings could fly. Some hunters used sticks to poke the nestlings out of the nest, while others shot the bottom of a nest with a blunt arrow to dislodge the pigeon. Others cut down a nesting tree in such a way that when it fell, it would also hit a second nesting tree and dislodge the pigeons within. In one case, of large trees were speedily cut down to get birds, and such methods were common. A severe method was to set fire to the base of a tree nested with pigeons; the adults would flee and the juveniles would fall to the ground. <a href="Sulfur">Sulfur</a> was sometimes burned beneath the nesting tree to suffocate the birds, which fell out of the tree in a weakened state.

By the mid-19th century, <a href="railroad">railroad</a>s had opened new opportunities for pigeon hunters. While previously it had proved too difficult to ship masses of pigeons to eastern cities, the access provided by the railroad permitted pigeon hunting to become commercialized. An extensive <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a> system was introduced in the 1860s, which improved communication across the United States, making it easier to spread information about the whereabouts of pigeon flocks. After being opened up to the railroads, the town of <a href="Plattsburgh%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">Plattsburg, New York</a> is estimated to have shipped 1.8 million pigeons to larger cities in 1851 alone at a price of 31 to 56 cents a dozen. By the late 19th century, the trade of passenger pigeons had become commercialized. Large commission houses employed trappers (known as "pigeoners") to follow the flocks of pigeons year-round. A single hunter is reported to have sent three million birds to eastern cities during his career. In 1874, at least 600 people were employed as pigeon trappers, a number which grew to 1,200 by 1881. Pigeons were caught in such numbers that by 1876, shipments of dead pigeons were unable to recoup the costs of the barrels and ice needed to ship them. The price of a barrel full of pigeons dropped to below fifty cents, due to overstocked markets. Passenger pigeons were instead kept alive so their meat would be fresh when the birds were killed, and sold once their market value had increased again. Thousands of birds were kept in large pens, though the bad conditions led many to die from lack of food and water, and by fretting (gnawing) themselves; many rotted away before they could be sold.

Hunting of passenger pigeons was documented and depicted in contemporaneous newspapers, wherein various trapping methods and uses were featured. The most often reproduced of these illustrations was captioned "Winter sports in northern Louisiana: shooting wild pigeons", and published in 1875. Passenger pigeons were also seen as <a href="agricultural%20pests">agricultural pests</a>, since entire crops could be destroyed by feeding flocks. The bird was described as a "perfect scourge" by some farming communities, and hunters were employed to "wage warfare" on the birds to save grain, as shown in another newspaper illustration from 1867 captioned as "Shooting wild pigeons in Iowa". When comparing these "pests" to the <a href="bison">bison</a> of the Great Plains, it is possible to infer that the valuable resource needed was not the species of animals but the agriculture which was consumed by said animal. The crops that were eaten were seen as marketable calories, proteins, and nutrients all grown for the wrong species.

The notion that the species could be driven to <a href="extinction">extinction</a> was alien to the early colonists, because the number of birds did not appear to diminish, and also because the concept of extinction was yet to be defined. The bird seems to have been slowly pushed westwards after the arrival of Europeans, becoming scarce or absent in the east, though there were still millions of birds in the 1850s. The population must have been decreasing in numbers for many years, though this went unnoticed due to the apparent vast number of birds, which clouded their decline. In 1856 Bénédict Henry Révoil may have been one of the first writers to voice concern about the fate of the passenger pigeon, after witnessing a hunt in 1847:
By the 1870s, the decrease in birds was noticeable, especially after the last large-scale nestings and subsequent slaughters of millions of birds in 1874 and 1878. By this time, large nestings only took place in the north, around the Great Lakes. The last large nesting was in <a href="Petoskey%2C%20Michigan">Petoskey, Michigan</a>, in 1878 (following one in Pennsylvania a few days earlier), where 50,000 birds were killed each day for nearly five months. The surviving adults attempted a second nesting at new sites, but were killed by professional hunters before they had a chance to raise any young. Scattered nestings are reported into the 1880s, but the birds were now wary, and commonly abandoned their nests if persecuted.

By the time of these last nestings, laws had already been enacted to protect the passenger pigeon, but these proved ineffective, as they were unclearly framed and hard to enforce. H. B. Roney, who had witnessed the Petoskey slaughter, led campaigns to protect the pigeon, but was met with resistance, and accusations that he was exaggerating the severity of the situation. Few offenders were prosecuted, mainly some poor trappers, but the large enterprises were not affected. In 1857, a bill was brought forth to the <a href="Ohio%20State%20Legislature">Ohio State Legislature</a> seeking protection for the passenger pigeon, yet a Select Committee of the Senate filed a report stating that the bird did not need protection, being "wonderfully prolific", and dismissing the suggestion that the species could be destroyed. Public protests against trap-shooting erupted in the 1870s, as the birds were badly treated before and after such contests. Conservationists were ineffective in stopping the slaughter. A bill was passed in the Michigan legislature making it illegal to net pigeons within of a nesting area. In 1897, a bill was introduced in the Michigan legislature asking for a 10-year closed season on passenger pigeons. Similar legal measures were passed and then disregarded in Pennsylvania. The gestures proved futile, and by the mid-1890s, the passenger pigeon had almost completely disappeared, and was probably extinct as a breeding bird in the wild. Small flocks are known to have existed at this point, since large numbers of birds were still being sold at markets. Thereafter, only small groups or individual birds were reported, many of which were shot on sight.

The last recorded nest and egg in the wild were collected in 1895 near Minneapolis. The last wild individual in Louisiana was discovered among a flock of mourning doves in 1896, and subsequently shot. Many late sightings are thought to be false or due to confusion with mourning doves. The last fully authenticated record of a wild passenger pigeon was near <a href="Oakford%2C%20Illinois">Oakford, Illinois</a>, on March 12, 1901, when a male bird was killed, stuffed, and placed in <a href="Millikin%20University">Millikin University</a> in <a href="Decatur%2C%20Illinois">Decatur, Illinois</a>, where it remains today. This was not discovered until 2014, when writer Joel Greenberg found out the date of the bird's shooting while doing research for his book "A Feathered River Across the Sky." Greenberg also pointed out a record of a male shot near <a href="Laurel%2C%20Indiana">Laurel, Indiana</a>, on April 3, 1902, that was stuffed but later destroyed.

For many years, the last confirmed wild passenger pigeon was thought to have been shot near <a href="Sargents%2C%20Ohio">Sargents</a>, <a href="Pike%20County%2C%20Ohio">Pike County, Ohio</a>, on March 24, 1900, when a female bird was killed by a boy named Press Clay Southworth with a <a href="BB%20gun">BB gun</a>. The boy had not recognized the bird as a passenger pigeon, but his parents identified it, and sent it to a taxidermist. The specimen, nicknamed "Buttons" due to the buttons used instead of glass eyes, was donated to the <a href="Ohio%20Historical%20Society">Ohio Historical Society</a> by the family in 1915. The reliability of accounts after the Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana birds are in question. U.S. President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> claimed to have seen a bird in Michigan in 1907. Ornithologist <a href="Alexander%20Wetmore">Alexander Wetmore</a> claimed that he saw a pair flying near <a href="Independence%2C%20Kansas">Independence, Kansas</a>, in April 1905. In 1910, the <a href="American%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> offered a reward of $3,000 for discovering a nest – the equivalent of $76,990 in 2015.

Most captive passenger pigeons were kept for exploitative purposes, but some were housed in zoos and aviaries. Audubon alone claimed to have brought 350 birds to England in 1830, distributing them among various noblemen, and the species is also known to have been kept at <a href="London%20Zoo">London Zoo</a>. Being common birds, these attracted little interest, until the species became rare in the 1890s. By the turn of the 20th century, the last known captive passenger pigeons were divided in three groups; one in Milwaukee, one in Chicago, and one in Cincinnati. There are claims of a few further individuals having been kept in various places, but these accounts are not considered reliable today. The Milwaukee group was kept by David Whittaker, who began his collection in 1888, and possessed fifteen birds some years later, all descended from a single pair.

The Chicago group was kept by Charles Otis Whitman, whose collection began with passenger pigeons bought from Whittaker beginning in 1896. He had an interest in studying pigeons, and kept his passenger pigeons with other pigeon species. Whitman brought his pigeons with him from Chicago to Massachusetts by railcar each summer. By 1897, Whitman had bought all of Whittaker's birds, and upon reaching a maximum of 19 individuals, he gave seven back to Whittaker in 1898. Around this time, a series of photographs were taken of these birds; 24 of the photos survive. Some of these images have been reproduced in various media, copies of which are now kept at the <a href="Wisconsin%20Historical%20Society">Wisconsin Historical Society</a>. It is unclear exactly where, when, and by whom these photos were taken, but some appear to have been taken in Chicago in 1896, others in Massachusetts in 1898, the latter by a J. G. Hubbard. By 1902, Whitman owned sixteen birds. Many eggs were laid by his pigeons, but few hatched, and many hatchlings died. A newspaper inquiry was published that requested "fresh blood" to the flock which had now ceased breeding. By 1907, he was down to two female passenger pigeons that died that winter, and was left with two infertile male hybrids, whose subsequent fate is unknown. By this time, only four (all males) of the birds Whitman had returned to Whittaker were alive, and these died between November 1908 and February 1909.
The Cincinnati Zoo, one of the oldest zoos in the United States, kept passenger pigeons from its beginning in 1875. The zoo kept more than twenty individuals, in a ten-by-twelve-foot cage. Passenger pigeons do not appear to have been kept at the zoo due to their rarity, but to enable guests to have a closer look at a native species. Recognizing the decline of the wild populations, Whitman and the Cincinnati Zoo consistently strove to breed the surviving birds, including attempts at making a rock dove foster passenger pigeon eggs. In 1902, Whitman gave a female passenger pigeon to the zoo; this was possibly the individual later known as Martha, which would become the last living member of the species. Other sources argue that Martha was hatched at the Cincinnati Zoo, had lived there for 25 years, and was the descendant of three pairs of passenger pigeons purchased by the zoo in 1877. It is thought this individual was named Martha because her last cage mate was named George, thereby honoring <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> and his wife <a href="Martha%20Washington">Martha</a>, though it has also been claimed she was named after the mother of a zookeeper's friends.

In 1909, Martha and her two male companions at the Cincinnati Zoo became the only known surviving passenger pigeons. One of these males died around April that year, followed by George, the remaining male, on July 10, 1910. It is unknown whether the remains of George were preserved. Martha soon became a celebrity due to her status as an <a href="endling">endling</a>, and offers of a $1,000 reward for finding a mate for her brought even more visitors to see her. During her last four years in solitude (her cage was ), Martha became steadily slower and more immobile; visitors would throw sand at her to make her move, and her cage was roped off in response. Martha died of old age on September 1, 1914, and was found lifeless on the floor of her cage. It was claimed that she died at 1 p.m., but other sources suggest she died some hours later. Depending on the source, Martha was between 17 and 29 years old at the time of her death, although 29 is the generally accepted figure. At the time, it was suggested that Martha might have died from an <a href="Apoplexy">apoplectic stroke</a>, as she had suffered one a few weeks before dying. Her body was frozen into a block of ice and sent to the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> in Washington, where it was skinned, dissected, photographed, and mounted. As she was <a href="molting">molting</a> when she died, she proved difficult to stuff, and previously shed feathers were added to the skin. Martha was on display for many years, but after a period in the museum vaults, she was put back on display at the Smithsonian's <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">National Museum of Natural History</a> in 2015. A memorial statue of Martha stands on the grounds of the Cincinnati Zoo, in front of the "Passenger Pigeon Memorial Hut", formerly the aviary wherein Martha lived, now a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>. Incidentally, the last specimen of the extinct <a href="Carolina%20parakeet">Carolina parakeet</a>, named "Incus," died in Martha's cage in 1918; the stuffed remains of that bird are exhibited in the "Memorial Hut".

The main reasons for the extinction of the passenger pigeon were the massive scale of hunting, the rapid loss of habitat, and the extremely social lifestyle of the bird, which made it highly vulnerable to the former factors. <a href="Deforestation">Deforestation</a> was driven by the need to free land for agriculture and expanding towns, but also due to the demand for lumber and fuel. About 728,000 km (180 million acres) were cleared for farming between 1850 and 1910. Though there are still large woodland areas in eastern North America, which support a variety of wildlife, it was not enough to support the vast number of passenger pigeons needed to sustain the population. In contrast, very small populations of nearly extinct birds, such as the <a href="kakapo">kakapo</a> ("Strigops habroptilus") and the <a href="takahe">takahe</a> ("Porphyrio hochstetteri"), have been enough to keep those species extant to the present. The combined effects of intense hunting and deforestation has been referred to as a "<a href="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a>" against the passenger pigeon, and it has been labeled one of the greatest and most senseless human-induced extinctions in history. As the flocks dwindled in size, the passenger pigeon population decreased below the threshold necessary to propagate the species.

The 2014 genetic study that found natural fluctuations in population numbers prior to human arrival also concluded that the species routinely recovered from lows in the population, and suggested that one of these lows may have coincided with the intensified exploitation by humans in the 1800s, a combination which would have led to the rapid extinction of the species. A similar scenario may also explain the rapid extinction of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20locust">Rocky Mountain locust</a> ("Melanoplus spretus") during the same period. It has also been suggested that after the population was thinned out, it would be harder for few or solitary birds to locate suitable feeding areas. In addition to the birds killed or driven away by hunting during breeding seasons, many nestlings were also orphaned before being able to fend for themselves. Other, less convincing contributing factors have been suggested at times, including mass drownings, <a href="Newcastle%20disease">Newcastle disease</a>, and migrations to areas outside their original range.

The extinction of the passenger pigeon aroused public interest in the <a href="conservation%20movement">conservation movement</a>, and resulted in new laws and practices which prevented many other species from becoming extinct. The rapid decline of the passenger pigeon has influenced later assessment methods of the extinction risk of endangered animal populations. The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has used the passenger pigeon as an example in cases where a species was declared "at risk" for extinction even though population numbers are high.

Today, more than 1,532 passenger pigeon skins (along with 16 skeletons) are in existence, spread across many institutions all over the world. It has been suggested that the passenger pigeon should be revived when available technology allows it (a concept which has been termed "<a href="de-extinction">de-extinction</a>"), using genetic material from such specimens. In 2003, the <a href="Pyrenean%20ibex">Pyrenean ibex</a> ("Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica", a subspecies of the <a href="Spanish%20ibex">Spanish ibex</a>) was the first extinct animal to be cloned back to life; the clone lived for only seven minutes before dying of lung defects. A hindrance to cloning the passenger pigeon is the fact that the DNA of museum specimens has been contaminated and fragmented, due to exposure to heat and oxygen. American geneticist <a href="George%20M.%20Church">George M. Church</a> has proposed that the passenger pigeon genome can be reconstructed by piecing together DNA fragments from different specimens. The next step would be to splice these genes into the <a href="stem%20cells">stem cells</a> of rock pigeons (or band-tailed pigeons), which would then be transformed into egg and sperm cells, and placed into the eggs of rock pigeons, resulting in rock pigeons bearing passenger pigeon sperm and eggs. The offspring of these would have passenger pigeon traits, and would be further bred to favor unique features of the extinct species. Reviving the passenger pigeon may help conserve woodland biodiversity in the eastern US.

The general idea of re-creating extinct species has been criticized, since the large funds needed could be spent on conserving currently threatened species and habitats, and because conservation efforts might be viewed as less urgent. In the case of the passenger pigeon, since it was very social, it is unlikely that enough birds could be created for revival to be successful, and it is unclear whether there is enough appropriate habitat left for its reintroduction. Furthermore, the parent pigeons that would raise the cloned passenger pigeons would belong to a different species, with a different way of rearing young.

Pyxis

Pyxis is a small and faint <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the southern sky. Abbreviated from Pyxis Nautica, its name is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for a <a href="mariner%27s%20compass">mariner's compass</a> (contrasting with <a href="Circinus">Circinus</a>, which represents a <a href="draftsman%27s%20compasses">draftsman's compasses</a>). Pyxis was introduced by <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> in the 18th century, and is counted among the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a>. 

The <a href="Galactic%20plane">plane</a> of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> passes through Pyxis. A faint constellation, its three brightest stars—<a href="Alpha%20Pyxidis">Alpha</a>, <a href="Beta%20Pyxidis">Beta</a> and <a href="Gamma%20Pyxidis">Gamma Pyxidis</a>—are in a rough line. At magnitude 3.68, Alpha is the constellation's brightest star. It is a blue-white star approximately distant and around 22,000 times as <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> as the Sun.
Pyxis is located close to the stars that formed the old constellation <a href="Argo%20Navis">Argo Navis</a>, the ship of <a href="Jason">Jason</a> and the <a href="Argonauts">Argonauts</a>. Parts of Argo Navis were the Carina (the keel or hull), the Puppis (the poop deck or stern), and the Vela (the sails). These eventually became their own constellations. In the 19th century, <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a> suggested renaming Pyxis to Malus (meaning the <a href="Mast%20%28sailing%29">mast</a>) but the suggestion was not followed.

<a href="T%20Pyxidis">T Pyxidis</a>, located about 4 degrees northeast of Alpha Pyxidis, is a <a href="recurrent%20nova">recurrent nova</a> that has flared up to <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> 7 every few decades. Also, three star systems in Pyxis have confirmed <a href="exoplanet">exoplanet</a>s. The <a href="Pyxis%20globular%20cluster">Pyxis globular cluster</a> is situated about 130,000 light-years away in the <a href="galactic%20halo">galactic halo</a>. This region was not thought to contain <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s. The possibility has been raised that this object might have escaped from the <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>.

In ancient <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a>, Alpha, Beta and Gamma Pyxidis formed part of "Tianmiao", a celestial temple honouring the ancestors of the emperor, along with stars from neighbouring <a href="Antlia">Antlia</a>.

The French astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> first described the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in French as "la Boussole" (the Marine Compass) in 1752, after he had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>. He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> not visible from Europe. All but one honoured instruments that symbolised the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. Lacaille Latinised the name to "Pixis" [sic] "Nautica" on his 1763 chart. The Ancient Greeks identified the four main stars of Pyxis as the mast of the mythological <a href="Jason">Jason</a>'s ship, "<a href="Argo%20Navis">Argo Navis</a>".
German astronomer <a href="Johann%20Elert%20Bode">Johann Bode</a> defined the constellation Lochium Funis, the Log, and Line—a nautical device once used for measuring speed and distance travelled at sea—around Pyxis in his 1801 star atlas, but the depiction did not survive. In 1844 <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a> attempted to resurrect the classical configuration of Argo Navis by renaming it Malus the Mast, a suggestion followed by <a href="Francis%20Baily">Francis Baily</a>, but <a href="Benjamin%20Apthorp%20Gould">Benjamin Gould</a> restored Lacaille's nomenclature.

Covering 220.8 square degrees and hence 0.535% of the sky, Pyxis ranks 65th of the <a href="88%20modern%20constellations">88 modern constellations</a> by area. Its position in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of <a href="52nd%20parallel%20north">52°N</a>. It is most visible in the evening sky in February and March. A small constellation, it is bordered by <a href="Hydra%20%28constellation%29">Hydra</a> to the north, <a href="Puppis">Puppis</a> to the west, <a href="Vela%20%28constellation%29">Vela</a> to the south, and Antlia to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Pyx'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a <a href="polygon">polygon</a> of eight sides ("illustrated in infobox"). In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −17.41° and −37.29°.

Lacaille gave <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s to ten stars now named Alpha to Lambda Pyxidis, skipping the Greek letters iota and kappa. Although a nautical element, the constellation was not an integral part of the old Argo Navis and hence did not share in the original Bayer designations of that constellation, which were split between Carina, Vela and Puppis. Pyxis is a faint constellation, its three brightest stars—<a href="Alpha%20Pyxidis">Alpha</a>, <a href="Beta%20Pyxidis">Beta</a> and <a href="Gamma%20Pyxidis">Gamma Pyxidis</a>—forming a rough line. Overall, there are 41 stars within the constellation's borders with <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a>s brighter than or equal to 6.5.

With an apparent magnitude of 3.68, Alpha Pyxidis is the brightest star in the constellation. Located 880 ± 30 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s distant from Earth, it is a blue-white <a href="giant%20star">giant star</a> of spectral type B1.5III that is around 22,000 times as <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> as the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> and has 9.4 ± 0.7 times its diameter. It began life with a mass 12.1 ± 0.6 times that of the Sun, almost 15 million years ago. Its light is dimmed by 30% due to <a href="Cosmic%20dust">interstellar dust</a>, so would have a brighter magnitude of 3.31 if not for this. The second brightest star at magnitude 3.97 is Beta Pyxidis, a yellow <a href="bright%20giant">bright giant</a> or <a href="supergiant">supergiant</a> of spectral type G7Ib-II that is around 435 times as luminous as the Sun, lying 420 ± 10 light-years distant away from Earth. It has a companion star of magnitude 12.5 separated by 9 <a href="minute%20of%20arc">arcseconds</a>. Gamma Pyxidis is a star of magnitude 4.02 that lies 207 ± 2 light-years distant. It is an orange giant of spectral type K3III that has cooled and swollen to 3.7 times the diameter of the Sun after exhausting its core hydrogen.

<a href="Kappa%20Pyxidis">Kappa Pyxidis</a> was catalogued but not given a Bayer designation by Lacaille, but Gould felt the star was bright enough to warrant a letter. Kappa has a magnitude of 4.62 and is 560 ± 50 light-years distant. An orange giant of spectral type K4/K5III, Kappa has a luminosity approximately 965 times that of the Sun. It is separated by 2.1 arcseconds from a magnitude 10 star. <a href="Theta%20Pyxidis">Theta Pyxidis</a> is a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> of spectral type M1III and semi-regular variable with two measured periods of 13 and 98.3 days, and an average magnitude of 4.71, and is 500 ± 30 light-years distant from Earth. It has expanded to approximately 54 times the diameter of the Sun.
Located around 4 degrees northeast of Alpha is <a href="T%20Pyxidis">T Pyxidis</a>, a binary star system composed of a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> with around 0.8 times the Sun's mass and a <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> that orbit each other every 1.8 hours. This system is located around 15,500 light-years away from Earth. A <a href="nova%23Recurrent%20novae">recurrent nova</a>, it has brightened to the 7th magnitude in the years 1890, 1902, 1920, 1944, 1966 and 2011 from a baseline of around 14th magnitude. These outbursts are thought to be due to the white dwarf accreting material from its companion and ejecting periodically.

<a href="TY%20Pyxidis">TY Pyxidis</a> is an <a href="Binary%20star%23Eclipsing%20binaries">eclipsing binary star</a> whose apparent magnitude ranges from 6.85 to 7.5 over 3.2 days. The two components are both of spectral type G5IV with a diameter 2.2 times, and mass 1.2 times that of the Sun, and revolve around each other every 3.2 days. The system is classified as a <a href="RS%20Canum%20Venaticorum%20variable">RS Canum Venaticorum variable</a>, a binary system with prominent <a href="starspot">starspot</a> activity, and lies 184 ± 5 light-years away. The system emits X-rays, and analysing the emission curve over time led researchers to conclude that there was a loop of material arcing between the two stars. <a href="RZ%20Pyxidis">RZ Pyxidis</a> is another eclipsing binary system, made up of two young stars less than 200,000 years old. Both are hot blue-white stars of spectral type B7V and are around 2.5 times the size of the Sun. One is around five times as luminous as the Sun and the other around four times as luminous. The system is classified as a <a href="Beta%20Lyrae%20variable">Beta Lyrae variable</a>, the apparent magnitude varying from 8.83 to 9.72 over 0.66 days. <a href="XX%20Pyxidis">XX Pyxidis</a> is one of the more-studied members of a class of stars known as <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a>s—short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as <a href="Cosmic%20distance%20ladder%23Standard%20candles">standard candles</a> and as subjects to study <a href="astroseismology">astroseismology</a>. Astronomers made more sense of its pulsations when it became clear that it is also a binary star system. The main star is a white main sequence star of spectral type A4V that is around 1.85 ± 0.05 times as massive as the Sun. Its companion is most likely a red dwarf of spectral type M3V, around 0.3 times as massive as the Sun. The two are very close—possibly only 3 times the diameter of the Sun between them—and orbit each other every 1.15 days. The brighter star is deformed into an egg shape.

<a href="AK%20Pyxidis">AK Pyxidis</a> is a red giant of spectral type M5III and semi-regular variable that varies between magnitudes 6.09 and 6.51. Its pulsations take place over multiple periods simultaneously of 55.5, 57.9, 86.7, 162.9 and 232.6 days. <a href="UZ%20Pyxidis">UZ Pyxidis</a> is another semi-regular variable red giant, this time a <a href="carbon%20star">carbon star</a>, that is around 3560 times as luminous as the Sun with a surface temperature of 3482 K, located 2116 light-years away from Earth. It varies between magnitudes 6.99 and 7.83 over 159 days. <a href="VY%20Pyxidis">VY Pyxidis</a> is a <a href="BL%20Herculis%20variable">BL Herculis variable</a> (<a href="type%20II%20Cepheid">type II Cepheid</a>), ranging between <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a>s 7.13 and 7.40 over a period of 1.24 days. Located around 650 light-years distant, it shines with a <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> approximately 45 times that of the Sun.

The closest star to Earth in the constellation is <a href="Gliese%20318">Gliese 318</a>, a white dwarf of spectral class DA5 and magnitude 11.85. Its distance has been calculated to be 26 light-years, or 28.7 ± 0.5 light-years distant from Earth. It has around 45% of the Sun's mass, yet only 0.15% of its luminosity. <a href="WISEPC%20J083641.12-185947.2">WISEPC J083641.12-185947.2</a> is a <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> of <a href="Brown%20dwarf%23Spectral%20class%20T">spectral type T8p</a> located around 72 light-years from Earth. Discovered by infrared astronomy in 2011, it has a magnitude of 18.79.

Pyxis is home to three stars with confirmed planetary systems—all discovered by <a href="Doppler%20spectroscopy">Doppler spectroscopy</a>. A <a href="hot%20Jupiter">hot Jupiter</a>, <a href="HD%2073256%20b">HD 73256 b</a>, that orbits <a href="HD%2073256">HD 73256</a> every 2.55 days, was discovered using the <a href="CORALIE%20spectrograph">CORALIE spectrograph</a> in 2003. The host star is a yellow star of spectral type G9V that has 69% of our Sun's luminosity, 89% of its diameter and 105% of its mass. Around 119 light-years away, it shines with an apparent magnitude of 8.08 and is around a billion years old. <a href="HD%2073267%20b">HD 73267 b</a> was discovered with the <a href="High%20Accuracy%20Radial%20Velocity%20Planet%20Searcher">High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher</a> (HARPS) in 2008. It orbits <a href="HD%2073267">HD 73267</a> every 1260 days, a 7 billion-year-old star of spectral type G5V that is around 89% as massive as the Sun. A <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> of spectral type M2.5V that has around 42% the Sun's mass, <a href="Gliese%20317">Gliese 317</a> is orbited by two gas giant planets. Around 50 light-years distant from Earth, it is a good candidate for future searches for more terrestrial rocky planets.

Pyxis lies in the <a href="Galactic%20plane">plane</a> of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, although part of the eastern edge is dark, with material obscuring our galaxy arm there. <a href="NGC%202818">NGC 2818</a> is a <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a> that lies within a dim <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> of magnitude 8.2. <a href="NGC%202818A">NGC 2818A</a> is an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> that lies on line of sight with it. <a href="K%201-2">K 1-2</a> is a planetary nebula whose central star is a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> composed of two stars in close orbit with <a href="Astrophysical%20jet">jets</a> emanating from the system. The surface temperature of one component has been estimated at as high as 85,000 K. <a href="NGC%202627">NGC 2627</a> is an <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> of magnitude 8.4 that is visible in binoculars.

Discovered in 1995, the <a href="Pyxis%20globular%20cluster">Pyxis globular cluster</a> is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a> situated around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years distant from the centre of the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the <a href="galactic%20halo">galactic halo</a>, it was noted to lie on the same plane as the <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> and the possibility has been raised that it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.

<a href="NGC%202613">NGC 2613</a> is a spiral galaxy of magnitude 10.5 which appears spindle-shaped as it is almost edge-on to observers on Earth. <a href="Henize%202-10">Henize 2-10</a> is a dwarf galaxy which lies 30 million light-years away. It has a black hole of around a million solar masses at its centre. Known as a <a href="starburst%20galaxy">starburst galaxy</a> due to very high rates of star formation, it has a bluish colour due to the huge numbers of young stars within it.

Press Gang

Press Gang is a British children's television comedy-drama consisting of 43 episodes across five series that were broadcast from 1989 to 1993. It was produced by Richmond Film & Television for <a href="Central%20Independent%20Television">Central</a>, and screened on the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> network in its regular weekday afternoon children's strand, <a href="CiTV">Children's ITV</a>, typically in a 4:45 pm slot (days varied over the course of the run).

Aimed at older children and teenagers, the programme was based on the activities of a children's newspaper, the "Junior Gazette", produced by pupils from the local <a href="comprehensive%20school">comprehensive school</a>. In later series it was depicted as a commercial venture. The show interspersed comedic elements with the dramatic. As well as addressing <a href="interpersonal%20relationship">interpersonal relationship</a>s (particularly in the Lynda-Spike <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a>), the show tackled issues such as <a href="solvent%20abuse">solvent abuse</a>, <a href="child%20abuse">child abuse</a> and <a href="firearm">firearm</a>s control.

Written by ex-teacher <a href="Steven%20Moffat">Steven Moffat</a>, more than half the episodes were directed by <a href="Bob%20Spiers">Bob Spiers</a>, a noted <a href="British%20comedy">British comedy</a> director who had previously worked on classics such as "<a href="Fawlty%20Towers">Fawlty Towers</a>". Critical reception was very positive, particularly for the quality of the writing, and the series has attracted a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a> with a wide age range.

Famous journalist Matt Kerr (<a href="Clive%20Wood">Clive Wood</a>) arrives from <a href="Fleet%20Street">Fleet Street</a> to edit the local newspaper. He sets up a junior version of the paper, "The Junior Gazette", to be produced by pupils from the local <a href="comprehensive%20school">comprehensive school</a> before and after school hours.

Some of the team are "star pupils", but others have reputations for delinquency. One such pupil, Spike Thompson (<a href="Dexter%20Fletcher">Dexter Fletcher</a>), is forced to work on the paper rather than being expelled from school. He is immediately attracted to editor Lynda Day (<a href="Julia%20Sawalha">Julia Sawalha</a>), but they bicker, throwing <a href="one-liner%20joke">one-liner</a>s at each other. Their relationship develops and they have an on-off relationship. They regularly discuss their feelings, especially in the concluding episodes of each series. In the final episode of the third series, "Holding On", Spike unwittingly expresses his strong feelings to Lynda while being taped. Jealous of his American girlfriend, Zoe, Lynda puts the cassette on Zoe's <a href="personal%20stereo">personal stereo</a>, ruining their relationship. The on-screen chemistry between the two leads was reflected off-screen as they became an item for several years.
Although the Lynda and Spike <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> runs throughout the series, most episodes feature self-contained stories and sub-plots. Amongst lighter stories, such as one about Colin accidentally attending a funeral dressed as a pink rabbit, the show tackled many serious issues. Jeff Evans, writing in the "Guinness Television Encyclopedia", writes that the series adopts a "far more adult approach" than "previous efforts in the same vein" such as "<a href="A%20Bunch%20of%20Fives">A Bunch of Fives</a>." Some critics also compared it with "<a href="Hill%20Street%20Blues">Hill Street Blues</a>", "<a href="Lou%20Grant%20%28TV%20series%29">Lou Grant</a>" "and other thoughtful US dramas, thanks to its realism and its level-headed treatment of touchy subjects." The first series approached <a href="solvent%20abuse">solvent abuse</a> in "How To Make A Killing", and the <a href="NSPCC">NSPCC</a> assisted in the production of the "<a href="Something%20Terrible">Something Terrible</a>" episodes about <a href="child%20abuse">child abuse</a>. The team were held hostage by a gun enthusiast in series three's "The Last Word", while the final episode approaches <a href="drug%20abuse">drug abuse</a>. The issue-led episodes served to develop the main characters, so that "Something Terrible" is more "about Colin's redemption [from selfish capitalist], rather than Cindy's abuse."

According to the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>, ""Press Gang" managed to be perhaps the funniest children's series ever made and at the same time the most painfully raw and emotionally honest. The tone could change effortlessly and sensitively from farce to tragedy in the space of an episode." Although the series is sometimes referred to as a comedy, Moffat insists that it is a drama with jokes in it. The writer recalls "a long running argument with Geoff Hogg (film editor on "Press Gang") about whether "Press Gang" was comedy. He insisted that it was and I said it wasn't – it was just funny." Some innuendo leads Moffat to claim that it "had the dirtiest jokes in history; we got away with tons of stuff ... We nearly got away with a joke about <a href="anal%20sex">anal sex</a>, but they spotted it at the last minute." In one episode Lynda says she's going to "butter him up", and, when asked (while on a date in a hotel's restaurant) if he was staying at the hotel, Colin replies "I shouldn't think so: it's only the first date."

Jeff Evans also comments that the series was filmed cinematically, dabbling in "dream sequences, flashbacks, fantasies and, on one occasion, a "<a href="Moonlighting%20%28TV%20series%29">Moonlighting</a>"-esque parody of the film "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Wonderful%20Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a>"." The show had a strong awareness of continuity, with some stories, incidents and minor characters referred to throughout the series. Actors who played short-term characters in the first two series were invited back to reprise their roles in future episodes. David Jefford (Alex Crockett) was resurrected from 1989's "Monday – Tuesday" to appear in the final episode "There Are Crocodiles", while the same actress (Aisling Flitton) who played a wrong number in "Love and the Junior Gazette" was invited to reprise her character for the third series episode "Chance is a Fine Thing." "Attention to detail" such as this is, according to <a href="Paul%20Cornell">Paul Cornell</a>, "one of the numerous ways that the series respects the intelligence of its viewers."

After the team leaves school, the paper gains financial independence and runs commercially. Assistant editor Kenny (<a href="Lee%20Ross%20%28actor%29">Lee Ross</a>) leaves at the end of series three to be replaced by Julie (<a href="Lucy%20Benjamin">Lucy Benjamin</a>), who was the head of the graphics team in series one.

Bill Moffat, a headmaster from <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, had an idea for a children's television programme called "The Norbridge Files". He showed it to a producer who visited his school, Thorn Primary School in <a href="Johnstone">Johnstone</a>, <a href="Renfrewshire">Renfrewshire</a>, when it was used as the location for an episode of <a href="Harry%20Secombe">Harry Secombe</a>'s "<a href="Highway%20%28TV%20series%29">Highway</a>". Producer Sandra C. Hastie liked the idea and showed it to her future husband Bill Ward, co-owner of her company Richmond Films and Television. When she requested a script, Moffat suggested that his 25-year-old son Steven, an English teacher, should write it. Hastie said that it was "the best ever first script" that she had read.

All 43 episodes were written by <a href="Steven%20Moffat">Steven Moffat</a>. During production of series two, he was having an unhappy personal life after the break-up of his first marriage. His wife's new lover was represented in the episode "The Big Finish?" by the character Brian Magboy (<a href="Simon%20Schatzberger">Simon Schatzberger</a>), a name inspired by Brian: Maggie's boy. Moffat brought in the character so that all sorts of unfortunate things would happen to him, such as having a <a href="typewriter">typewriter</a> dropped on his foot. This period in Moffat's life would also be reflected in his sitcom "<a href="Joking%20Apart">Joking Apart</a>".

Central Independent Television had confidence in the project, so rather than the show being shot at their studios in <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> as planned, they granted Richmond a £2 million budget. This enabled it to be shot on <a href="16%20mm%20film">16 mm film</a>, rather than the regular, less expensive <a href="videotape">videotape</a>, and <a href="Filming%20location">on location</a>, making it very expensive compared with most children's television. These high production costs almost led to its cancellation at the end of the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.

More than half of the episodes were directed by <a href="Bob%20Spiers">Bob Spiers</a>, a noted British comedy director who had previously worked on "<a href="Fawlty%20Towers">Fawlty Towers</a>" amongst many other programmes. He would work again with Moffat on his sitcom "<a href="Joking%20Apart">Joking Apart</a>" and "<a href="Murder%20Most%20Horrid">Murder Most Horrid</a>", and with Sawalha on "<a href="Absolutely%20Fabulous">Absolutely Fabulous</a>". According to Moffat, Spiers was the "principal director" taking an interest in the other episodes and setting the visual style of the show. Spiers particularly used <a href="tracking%20shot">tracking shot</a>s, sometimes requiring more dialogue to be written to accommodate the length of the shot. The other directors would come in and "do a Spiers". All of the directors were encouraged to attend the others' shoots so that the visual style would be consistent.

The first two episodes were directed by <a href="Colin%20Nutley">Colin Nutley</a>. However, he was unhappy with the final edit and requested that his name be removed from the credits. Lorne Magory directed many episodes, notably the two-part stories "How To Make A Killing" and "The Last Word." One of the founders of Richmond Films and Television, Bill Ward, directed three episodes, and Bren Simson directed some of series two. The show's <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a> James Devis took the directorial reins for "Windfall", the penultimate episode.

Whilst the show was set in the fictional town of Norbridge, it was mostly filmed in <a href="Uxbridge%2C%20London">Uxbridge</a>, a suburb of London. Many of the scenes were shot at <a href="Haydon%20School">Haydon School</a> in <a href="Pinner">Pinner</a>. The first series was filmed entirely on location, but after the demolition of the building used as the original newspaper office, interior shots were filmed in <a href="Pinewood%20Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> for the second series, and the exterior of the building was not seen beyond that series. Subsequent series were filmed at <a href="Shepperton%20Studios">Lee International Studios</a> at <a href="Shepperton">Shepperton</a> (series three and four) and <a href="Twickenham%20Studios">Twickenham Studios</a> (series five).

The <a href="theme%20music">theme music</a> was composed by Peter Davis (who after the second series composed the rest of the series alone as principal composer), <a href="John%20Mealing">John Mealing</a> and John G. Perry. The opening titles show the main characters striking a pose, with the name of the respective actor in a typewriter style typeface. Steven Moffat and Julia Sawalha were not very impressed with the opening titles when discussing them for a DVD commentary in 2004. They were re-recorded for series three, in the same style, to address the actors' ages and alterations to the set.

Many of the closing titles in the first two series were accompanied by dialogue from two characters. Episodes that ended on a particularly sombre tone, such as "Monday-Tuesday" and "Yesterday's News", used only appropriately sombre music to accompany the end credits. After an emphatic climax, "At Last a Dragon" used an enhanced version of the main theme with more extravagant use of electric guitar. Moffat felt that the voiceovers worked well in the first series, but that they were not as good in the second. Hastie recalls that Moffat was "extremely angry" that "<a href="Drop%20the%20Dead%20Donkey">Drop the Dead Donkey</a>" had adopted the style. They were dropped after the second series. The cast, according to Moffat, were "grumpy with having to turn up to a recording studio to record them."

Lynda Day (<a href="Julia%20Sawalha">Julia Sawalha</a>) is the editor of the "Junior Gazette". She is strong and opinionated, and is feared by many of her team. Moffat has said that the character was partly based on the show's "ball-breaking" producer, Sandra C. Hastie. Although she appears very tough, she occasionally exposes her feelings. She quits the paper at the end of "Monday-Tuesday", and in "Day Dreams" laments "Why do I get everything in my whole stupid life wrong?" Intimidated by socialising, she <a href="hiccup">hiccup</a>s at the idea. She is so nervous at a <a href="cocktail%20party">cocktail party</a>, in "At Last a Dragon", that she attempts to leave on several occasions. The mixture of Lynda's sensitive side and her <a href="Self-sufficiency">self-sufficient</a> attitude is illustrated in the series' final episode "There Are Crocodiles." Reprimanding the ghost of Gary (Mark Sayers), who died after taking a drug overdose, she says:

Look, I'm sorry you're dead, okay? I "do" care. But to be perfectly honest with you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous? ... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately? ... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.

James "Spike" Thomson (<a href="Dexter%20Fletcher">Dexter Fletcher</a>) is an American delinquent, forced to work on the paper rather than being excluded from school. He is immediately attracted to Lynda, and he establishes himself as an important member of the reporting team having been responsible for getting their first lead story. He usually has a range of one-liners, though is often criticised, particularly by Lynda, for excessive joking. However, Spike often consciously uses humour to lighten the tone, such as in "Monday-Tuesday" when he tries to cheer up Lynda after she feels responsible for David's suicide.

The character was originally written as English, until producer Hastie felt that an American character would enhance the chance of overseas sales. This meant that English-born Fletcher had to act in an <a href="Regional%20accents%20of%20English%20speakers">American accent</a> for all five years. Moffat says that he isn't "sure [that] lumbering Dexter with that accent was a smart move." The American accent had some fans surprised to learn that Fletcher is actually English.

Kenny Phillips (<a href="Lee%20Ross%20%28actor%29">Lee Ross</a>) is one of Lynda's (few) long-term friends and is her assistant editor in the first three series. Kenny is much calmer than Lynda, though is still dominated by her. Despite this, he is one of the few people able to stand up to Lynda, in his own quiet way. Although he identifies himself as "sweet", he is unlucky in love: Jenny (<a href="Sadie%20Frost">Sadie Frost</a>), the girlfriend he meets in "How to Make a Killing", dumps him because he is too understanding. His secret passion for writing music is revealed at the end of series two, which was influenced by Ross' interests. Colin organizes and markets a concert for him, and the second series ends with Kenny performing "You Don't Feel For Me" (written by Ross himself). Lee Ross was only able to commit to the first six episodes of the 12-episode series three and four filming block because he was expecting a film role. Thus, by series four, Kenny has left for Australia.

Colin Mathews (<a href="Paul%20Reynolds%20%28actor%29">Paul Reynolds</a>) is the <a href="Thatcherite">Thatcherite</a> in charge of the paper's finances and advertising. He often wears loud shirts, and his various schemes have included marketing defective half-<a href="ping-pong">ping-pong</a> balls (as 'pings'), exam revision kits and <a href="soft%20drink">soda</a> that leaves facial stains. <a href="Rosie%20Marcel">Rosie Marcel</a> and Claire Hearnden appear throughout the second series as Sophie and Laura, Colin's mischievous young helpers.

Julie Craig (<a href="Lucy%20Benjamin">Lucy Benjamin</a>) is the head of the graphics team in series one. Moffat was impressed with Benjamin's performance, and expanded her character for the second series. However she had committed herself to roles in the <a href="LWT">LWT</a> sitcom "<a href="Close%20to%20Home%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Close to Home</a>" and "<a href="Jupiter%20Moon">Jupiter Moon</a>", so the character was replaced by Sam. The character returns in the opening episode of series four as researcher on the Saturday morning show "Crazy Stuff". She arranges for Lynda and Spike to be reunited on <a href="live%20television">live television</a>, but the subsequent complaints about the violence (face slapping) results in Julie's firing. After giving Lynda some home truths, Julie replaces Kenny as the assistant editor for the final two series. She is a flirt, and, according to Lynda, was the "official pin-up at the last <a href="prison%20riot">prison riot</a>."
Sarah Jackson (<a href="Kelda%20Holmes">Kelda Holmes</a>) is the paper's lead writer. Although she is intelligent she gets stressed, such as during her interview for editorship of the "Junior Gazette". Her final episode, "Friendly Fire", shows the development of her friendship with Lynda, and how the latter saw her as a challenge when she first arrived to Norbridge High. Together they had established the underground school magazine: "Damn Magazine". Her first attempt to leave the newspaper to attend a writing course at the local college is thwarted by Lynda, but she eventually leaves in series five to attend university (mirroring the reason for Holmes' departure).

Frazer "Frazz" Davis (<a href="Mmoloki%20Chrystie">Mmoloki Chrystie</a>) is one of Spike's co-delinquents forced into working on the paper, his initial main task writing the <a href="horoscope">horoscope</a>s. Frazz is initially portrayed as "intellectually challenged", such as not understanding the synonymous relationship between "the astrology column" and the horoscopes. Later episodes, however, show him to be devious, such as in "The Last Word: Part 2" when he stuns the gunman using a large array of <a href="flashgun">flashgun</a>s.

Sam Black (<a href="Gabrielle%20Anwar">Gabrielle Anwar</a>) replaced Julie as the head of the graphics team in the second series. Sam is very fashion conscious and a flirt, and is surprised when an actor rejects her advances in favour of Sarah. Anwar had auditioned for the role of Lynda. (Many actors who unsuccessfully auditioned for main characters were invited back later for guest roles.) Moffat had expanded the role of Julie after the first series, but Lucy Benjamin was unavailable for series two. Sam, therefore, was basically the character of Julie under a different name, especially in her earlier episodes.

<a href="Charlie%20Creed-Miles">Charlie Creed-Miles</a>, who played Danny McColl, the paper's photographer, became disenchanted with his minor role and left after the second series.

Toni "Tiddler" Tildesley (<a href="Joanna%20Dukes">Joanna Dukes</a>) is the junior member of the team, responsible for the junior section, "Junior Junior Gazette".

Billy Homer (Andy Crowe) was also a recurring character. A <a href="tetraplegic">tetraplegic</a>, he is very competent with computer networks, sometimes <a href="Hacker%20%28computer%20security%29">hacking</a> into the school's database. His storylines are some of the first representations of the Internet in British television. Moffat felt that he was unable to sustain the character, and he appears only sporadically after the first series.

The main adults are deputy headmaster Bill Sullivan (<a href="Nick%20Stringer">Nick Stringer</a>), maverick editor Matt Kerr (<a href="Clive%20Wood">Clive Wood</a>) and experienced "Gazette" reporter Chrissie Stewart (<a href="Angela%20Bruce">Angela Bruce</a>).

Critical reaction was good, the show being particularly praised for the high quality and sophistication of the writing. The first episode was highly rated by "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" and the "<a href="Times%20Educational%20Supplement">Times Educational Supplement</a>". In his emphatic review, Paul Cornell writes that:

"Press Gang" has proved to be a series that can transport you back to how you felt as a teenager, sharper that the world but with as much angst as acute wit ... Never again can a show get away with talking down to children or writing sloppily for them. "Press Gang", possibly the best show in the world.

"<a href="Time%20Out%20%28company%29">Time Out</a>" said that "this is quality entertainment: the kids are sharp, the scripts are clever and the jokes are good." The BBC's William Gallagher called it "pretty flawless", with "The Guardian" retrospectively commending the series. Others, such as Popmatters, have also commented upon how "the show is renowned ... for doing something kid television at the time didn't do (and, arguably, still doesn't): it refused to treat its audience like children." Comedian <a href="Richard%20Herring">Richard Herring</a> recalls watching the show as a recent graduate, commenting that it "was subtle, sophisticated and much too good for kids." According to Moffat, ""Press Gang" had gone over very, very well in the industry and I was being touted and romanced all the time." "Press Gang"'s complicated plots and structure would become a hallmark of Moffat's work, such as "Joking Apart" and "<a href="Coupling%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Coupling</a>".

The series received a <a href="Royal%20Television%20Society">Royal Television Society</a> award and a <a href="BAFTA">BAFTA</a> in 1991 for "Best Children's Programme (Entertainment/Drama)". It was also nominated for two <a href="Writers%27%20Guild%20of%20Great%20Britain">Writers' Guild of Great Britain</a> awards, one "Prix Jeunesse" and the 1992 BAFTA for "Best Children's Programme (Fiction)". Julia Sawalha won the Royal Television Society Television Award for "Best Actor – Female" in 1993.

The show gained an even wider adult audience in an early evening slot when repeated on Sundays on <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> in 1991. This crossover is reflected in the BBC's review for one of the DVDs when they say that ""Press Gang" is one of the best series ever made for kids. Or adults."

<a href="Nickelodeon%20%28British%20TV%20channel%29">Nickelodeon</a> showed nearly all of the episodes in a weekday slot in 1997. The final three episodes of the third series, however, were not repeated on the children's channel because of their content: "The Last Word" double episode with the gun siege, and "Holding On" with the repetition of the phrase "divorce the <a href="Bitch%20%28insult%29">bitch</a>". On the first transmission of the latter on 11 June 1991, <a href="continuity%20announcer">continuity announcer</a> <a href="Tommy%20Boyd">Tommy Boyd</a> warned viewers that it contained stronger than usual language. In 2007, <a href="itv.com">itv.com</a> made the first series, with the exception of "Page One", available to be viewed on its website free of charge.

2 episodes were broadcast on the CITV Channel on 5 & 6 January 2013, as part of a weekend of archive programmes to celebrate CITV's 30th anniversary.

"Press Gang" has attracted a cult following. A <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>, "Breakfast at Czars", was produced in the 1990s. Edited by Stephen O'Brien, it contained a range of interviews with the cast and crew (notably with producer Hastie), theatre reviews and <a href="fanfiction">fanfiction</a>. The first edition was included as a PDF file on the series two DVD, while the next three were on the series five disc. An <a href="mailing%20list">e-mail discussion list</a> has been operational since February 1997. Scholar Miles Booy observes that as Steven Moffat was himself a fan of "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>", he was able to ingrate the elements that TV fans appreciated, such as:

series finales with big cliff-hangers, rigorous continuity and a slew of running jokes and references which paid those who watched and rewatched the text to pull out its minutia. At the end of the second series, it is remarked that the news team have been following the Spike/Lynda romance 'since page one', and only the fans remembered – or discovered on reviewing – that "Page One" was the title of the first episode.

Booy points out that <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a> and <a href="Joss%20Whedon">Joss Whedon</a> would be acclaimed for these elements in the 1990s (in the shows "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>" and "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28TV%20series%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>"), but "Moffat got there first, and ... in a children's TV slot. His was the first show to arrive with a Britain's fan's sensibility to formal possibilities."

Two <a href="Fan%20convention">convention</a>s were held in the mid-1990s in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. The events, in aid of the NSPCC, were each titled "Both Sides of the Paper" and were attended by Steven Moffat, Sandra Hastie, Dexter Fletcher, Paul Reynolds, Kelda Holmes and Nick Stringer. There were screenings of extended rough cuts of "A Quarter to Midnight" and "There Are Crocodiles", along with auctions of wardrobe and props. When <a href="Virgin%20Publishing">Virgin Publishing</a> prevented <a href="Paul%20Cornell">Paul Cornell</a> from writing an episode guide, the "Press Gang Programme Guide", edited by Jim Sangster, was published by Leomac Publishing in 1995. Sangster, O'Brien and Adrian Petford collaborated with <a href="Network%20DVD">Network DVD</a> on the extra features for the DVD releases.

<a href="Big%20Finish%20Productions">Big Finish Productions</a>, which produces <a href="radio%20drama">audio plays</a> based on sci-fi properties, particularly "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>", was named after the title of the final episode of the second series. Moffat himself is an ardent "Doctor Who" fan, and became the programme's lead writer and executive producer in 2009.

Moffat has integrated many references to secondary characters and locations in "Press Gang" in his later work. His 1997 sitcom "<a href="Chalk%20%28TV%20series%29">Chalk</a>" refers to a neighbouring school as Norbridge High, run by Mr Sullivan, and to the characters Dr Clipstone ("UneXpected"), Malcolm Bullivant ("Something Terrible") and David Jefford ("Monday-Tuesday"/"There are Crocodiles"), a pupil who Mr Slatt (<a href="David%20Bamber">David Bamber</a>) reprimands for <a href="masturbating">masturbating</a>. The name "Talwinning" appears as the name of streets in "A Quarter to Midnight" and "Joking Apart", and as the surname of the protagonist in "Dying Live", an episode of "<a href="Murder%20Most%20Horrid">Murder Most Horrid</a>" written by Moffat, as well as the name of a librarian in his "Doctor Who" prose short story, "Continuity Errors", which was published in the 1996 <a href="Virgin%20Books">Virgin Books</a> anthology "<a href="Virgin%20Decalog">Decalog 3: Consequences</a>". The name "Inspector Hibbert", from "The Last Word", is given to the character played by Nick Stringer in "Elvis, Jesus and Jack", Moffat's final "Murder Most Horrid" contribution. Most recently, in the first episode of Moffat's "<a href="Jekyll%20%28TV%20series%29">Jekyll</a>", Mr Hyde (<a href="James%20Nesbitt">James Nesbitt</a>) whistled the same tune as Lynda in "Going Back to Jasper Street".

A television film called "Deadline" was planned. It was set a few years after the series and aimed at a more adult audience. At one stage in 1992, series 4 was intended to be the last, and the movie was proposed as a follow-up. However, making of the film fell through when a fifth series was commissioned instead. The idea of the follow-up film was reconsidered several times during the 1990s, but every time fell through for various reasons.

In June 2007, "<a href="The%20Stage">The Stage</a>" reported that Moffat and Sawalha are interested in reviving "Press Gang". He said: "I would revive that like a shot. I would love to do a reunion episode—a grown-up version. I know Julia Sawalha is interested—every time I see her she asks me when we are going to do it. Maybe it will happen—I would like it to." "The Guardian" advocated the show's revival, arguing that "a revamped "Press Gang" with Moffat at the helm could turn the show from a cult into a national institution - a petri dish for young acting and writing talent to thrive. It's part of our TV heritage and definitely worthy of resuscitation."

At the <a href="Edinburgh%20International%20Television%20Festival">Edinburgh International Television Festival</a> in August 2008, Moffat told how he got drunk after the wrap party for "<a href="Jekyll%20%28TV%20series%29">Jekyll</a>" and pitched the idea of a "Press Gang" reunion special to the Head of Drama at the BBC, <a href="John%20Yorke%20%28television%20producer%29">John Yorke</a>. Despite Yorke's approval, the writer said that he was too busy with his work on "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" to pursue the idea.

Several products have been released, specifically four novelisations, a video and the complete collection on DVD.

Four <a href="novelisation">novelisation</a>s were written by Bill Moffat and published by Hippo Books/Scholastic in 1989 and 1990 based on the first two series. "First Edition" was based on the first three episodes, with "Public Exposure" covering "Interface" and "How to Make a Killing." The third book, "Checkmate", covered "Breakfast at Czar's", "Picking Up the Pieces" and "Going Back to Jasper Street", and reveals that Julie left the graphics department to go to art college. The fourth and final book, "The Date", is a novelisation of "Money, Love and Birdseed", "Love and the Junior Gazette" and "At Last a Dragon." Each book featured an eight-page photographic insert.

VCI Home Video, with Central Video, released one volume on VHS in 1990 featuring the first four episodes: "Page One", "Photo Finish", "One Easy Lesson" and "Deadline." The complete series of "Press Gang" is available on DVD (Region 2, UK) from <a href="Network%20DVD">Network DVD</a> and in Australia (Region 4) from Force Entertainment. Four episodes of the second series DVD features an <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a> by <a href="Julia%20Sawalha">Julia Sawalha</a> and Steven Moffat, in which the actress claims to remember very little about the show. <a href="Shooting%20script">Shooting script</a>s and extracts from Jim Sangster's programme guide (published by Leomac Publishing) are included in <a href="Portable%20Document%20Format">PDF</a> format from series two onwards. The second series DVD set also contains the only existing copy, in <a href="Offline%20editing">offline</a> edit form, of an unaired documentary filmed during production of series two.

Quagga

The quagga ( or ) ("Equus quagga quagga") was a <a href="plains%20zebra">plains zebra</a> that lived in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> until becoming <a href="extinct">extinct</a> late in the 19th century. It was long thought to be a distinct species, but early <a href="genetic%20studies">genetic studies</a> have supported it being a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of plains zebra. A more recent study suggested that it was merely the southernmost <a href="ecotype">ecotype</a> of the species. The name was derived from its call, which sounded like "kwa-ha-ha".

The quagga is believed to have been around long and tall at the shoulder. It was distinguished from other zebras by its limited pattern of primarily brown and white stripes, mainly on the front part of the body. The rear was brown and without stripes, and therefore more horse-like. The distribution of stripes varied considerably between individuals. Little is known about the quagga's behaviour, but it may have gathered into herds of 30–50. Quaggas were said to be wild and lively, yet were also considered more docile than Burchell's zebra. They were once found in great numbers in the <a href="Karoo">Karoo</a> of <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape Province</a> and the southern part of the <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a> in South Africa.

After the Dutch settlement of South Africa began, the quagga was heavily hunted as it competed with domesticated animals for forage. Some were taken to zoos in Europe, but breeding programmes were unsuccessful. The last wild population lived in the Orange Free State, and the quagga was <a href="extinct%20in%20the%20wild">extinct in the wild</a> by 1878. The last captive specimen died in Amsterdam on 12 August 1883. Only one quagga was ever photographed alive and only 23 skins are preserved today. In 1984, the quagga was the first extinct animal to have its <a href="DNA">DNA</a> analysed, and the <a href="Quagga%20Project">Quagga Project</a> is trying to recreate the <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a> of hair coat pattern and related characteristics by <a href="selectively%20breeding">selectively breeding</a> Burchell's zebras.

The name "quagga" is derived from the <a href="Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> word for "zebra" and is <a href="Onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a>, being said to resemble the quagga's call, variously transcribed as "kwa-ha-ha", "kwahaah", or "oug-ga". The name is still used <a href="colloquially">colloquially</a> for the <a href="plains%20zebra">plains zebra</a>. The quagga was originally classified as a distinct <a href="species">species</a>, "Equus quagga", in 1778 by Dutch naturalist <a href="Pieter%20Boddaert">Pieter Boddaert</a>. Traditionally, the quagga and the other plains and mountain zebras were placed in the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Hippotigris">Hippotigris</a>".

Much debate has occurred over the status of the quagga in relation to the plains zebra. It is poorly represented in the fossil record, and the identification of these fossils is uncertain, as they were collected at a time when the name "quagga" referred to all zebras. Fossil skulls of "Equus mauritanicus" from Algeria have been claimed to show affinities with the quagga and the plains zebra, but they may be too badly damaged to allow definite conclusions to be drawn from them. Quaggas have also been identified in <a href="cave%20art">cave art</a> attributed to the <a href="San%20people">San</a>. <a href="Reginald%20Innes%20Pocock">Reginald Innes Pocock</a> was perhaps the first to suggest that the quagga was a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of plains zebra in 1902. As the quagga was scientifically described and named before the plains zebra, the <a href="trinomial%20nomenclature">trinomial name</a> for the quagga becomes "E. quagga quagga" under this scheme, and the other subspecies of plains zebra are placed under "E. quagga", as well.

Historically, quagga taxonomy was further complicated because the extinct southernmost population of <a href="Burchell%27s%20zebra">Burchell's zebra</a> ("Equus quagga burchellii", formerly "Equus burchellii burchellii") was thought to be a distinct subspecies (also sometimes thought a full species, "E. burchellii"). The extant northern population, the "Damara zebra", was later named "Equus quagga antiquorum", which means that it is today also referred to as "E. q. burchellii", after it was realised they were the same <a href="taxon">taxon</a>. The extinct population was long thought very close to the quagga, since it also showed limited striping on its hind parts. As an example of this, Shortridge placed the two in the now disused subgenus "Quagga" in 1934. Most experts now suggest that the two subspecies represent two ends of a <a href="cline%20%28biology%29">cline</a>.

Different subspecies of plains zebras were recognised as members of "Equus quagga" by early researchers, though much confusion existed over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described on the basis of differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to <a href="individual%20variation">individual variation</a> within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as "E. q. danielli" and "Hippotigris isabellinus", were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. Some authors have described the quagga as a kind of <a href="wild%20horse">wild horse</a> rather than a zebra, and one <a href="craniometric">craniometric</a> study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the <a href="horse">horse</a> ("Equus caballus"). Early <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> studies have been pointed out to be erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used <a href="donkey">donkey</a> and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.

The quagga was the first extinct animal to have its <a href="DNA">DNA</a> analysed, and this 1984 study launched the field of <a href="ancient%20DNA">ancient DNA</a> analysis. It confirmed that the quagga was more closely related to zebras than to horses, with the quagga and <a href="mountain%20zebra">mountain zebra</a> ("Equus zebra") sharing an ancestor 3–4 million years ago. An <a href="immunological">immunological</a> study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains zebra. A 1987 study suggested that the <a href="mtDNA">mtDNA</a> of the quagga diverged at a range of roughly 2% per million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains zebra.

Later morphological studies came to conflicting conclusions. A 1999 analysis of cranial measurements found that the quagga was as different from the plains zebra as the latter is from the mountain zebra. A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains zebra. In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept the plains zebra and the quagga as separate species.

A <a href="genetic%20study">genetic study</a> published in 2005 confirmed the subspecific status of the quagga. It showed that the quagga had little genetic diversity, and that it diverged from the other plains zebra subspecies only between 120,000 and 290,000 years ago, during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, and possibly the penultimate glacial maximum. Its distinct coat pattern perhaps evolved rapidly because of geographical isolation and/or adaptation to a drier environment. In addition, plains zebra subspecies tend to have less striping the further south they live, and the quagga was the most southern-living of them all. Other large African <a href="ungulates">ungulates</a> diverged into separate species and subspecies during this period, as well, probably because of the same climate shift.

The simplified <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> below is based on the 2005 analysis (some taxa shared <a href="haplotype">haplotype</a>s and could, therefore, not be differentiated):
A 2018 genetic study of plains zebras populations confirmed the quagga as a member of the species. They found no evidence for subspecific differentiation based on morphological differences between southern populations of zebras, including the quagga. Modern plains zebra populations may have originated from southern Africa, and the quagga appears to be less divergent from neighbouring populations than the northernmost living population in northeastern <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>. Instead, the study supported a north-south genetic continuum for plains zebras, with the Ugandan population being the most distinct. Zebras from <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> appear to be the closest genetically to the quagga.

The quagga is believed to have been long and tall at the shoulder. Its coat pattern was unique among <a href="equids">equids</a>: zebra-like in the front but more like a horse in the rear. It had brown and white stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs. The stripes were boldest on the head and neck and became gradually fainter further down the body, blending with the reddish brown of the back and flanks, until disappearing along the back. It appears to have had a high degree of <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">polymorphism</a>, with some having almost no stripes and others having patterns similar to the extinct southern population of Burchell's zebra, where the stripes covered most of the body except for the hind parts, legs and belly. It also had a broad dark dorsal stripe on its back. It had a standing <a href="mane%20%28horse%29">mane</a> with brown and white stripes.

The only quagga to have been photographed alive was a <a href="mare">mare</a> at the <a href="Zoological%20Society%20of%20London">Zoological Society of London</a>'s <a href="London%20Zoo">Zoo</a>. Five photographs of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870. On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the stripes on the quagga were light on a dark background, unlike other zebras. <a href="Reinhold%20Rau">Reinhold Rau</a>, pioneer of the <a href="Quagga%20Project">Quagga Project</a>, claimed that this is an <a href="optical%20illusion">optical illusion</a>: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark. <a href="Embryological">Embryological</a> evidence supports zebras being dark coloured with white as an addition.

Living in the very southern end of the plains zebra's range, the quagga had a thick <a href="Coat%20%28animal%29">winter coat</a> that <a href="Moulting">moulted</a> each year. Its skull was described as having a straight profile and a <a href="wikt%3Aconcavity">concave</a> <a href="diastema">diastema</a>, and as being relatively broad with a narrow <a href="occiput">occiput</a>. Like other plains zebras, the quagga did not have a <a href="dewlap">dewlap</a> on its neck as the mountain zebra does. The 2004 morphological study found that the skeletal features of the southern Burchell's zebra population and the quagga overlapped, and that they were impossible to distinguish. Some specimens also appeared to be intermediate between the two in striping, and the extant Burchell's zebra population still exhibits limited striping. It can therefore be concluded that the two subspecies graded morphologically into each other. Today, some stuffed specimens of quaggas and southern Burchell's zebra are so similar that they are impossible to definitely identify as either, since no location data was recorded. The female specimens used in the study were larger than the males on average.

The quagga was the southernmost distributed plains zebra, mainly living south of the <a href="Orange%20River">Orange River</a>. It was a grazer, and its habitat range was restricted to the grasslands and arid interior scrubland of the <a href="Karoo">Karoo</a> region of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, today forming parts of the provinces of <a href="Northern%20Cape">Northern Cape</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Cape">Eastern Cape</a>, <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a> and the <a href="Free%20State%20%28province%29">Free State</a>. These areas were known for distinctive flora and fauna and high amounts of <a href="endemism">endemism</a>.

Little is known about the behaviour of quaggas in the wild, and it is sometimes unclear what exact species of zebra is referred to in old reports. The only source that unequivocally describes the quagga in the Free State is that of the English military engineer and hunter <a href="William%20Cornwallis%20Harris">Major Sir William Cornwallis Harris</a>. His 1840 account reads as follows:

The geographical range of the quagga does not appear to extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.

Quaggas have been reported gathering into herds of 30–50, and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been <a href="Sympatry">sympatric</a> with Burchell's zebra between the <a href="Vaal%20River">Vaal</a> and Orange rivers. This is disputed, and there is no evidence that they interbred. It could also have shared a small portion of its range with <a href="Hartmann%27s%20mountain%20zebra">Hartmann's mountain zebra</a> ("Equus zebra hartmannae").

Quaggas were said to be lively and highly strung, especially the stallions. During the 1830s, quaggas were used as harness animals for carriages in London, the males probably being <a href="gelded">gelded</a> to mitigate their volatile nature. Local farmers used them as guards for their livestock, as they were likely to attack intruders. On the other hand, captive quaggas in European zoos were said to be tamer and more docile than Burchell's zebra. One specimen was reported to have lived in captivity for 21 years and 4 months, dying in 1872.

Since the practical function of striping has not been determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A <a href="Crypsis">cryptic</a> function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided <a href="species%20recognition">species recognition</a> during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a> to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with this is that the mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity than other zebras.

As it was easy to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch settlers and later by <a href="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a>s to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a>, was <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpated</a> in the late 1870s. The last known wild quagga died in 1878.

Quaggas were captured and shipped to Europe, where they were displayed in zoos. <a href="George%20Douglas%2C%2016th%20Earl%20of%20Morton">Lord Morton</a> tried to save the animal from extinction by starting a captive-breeding programme. He was only able to obtain a single male, which in desperation he bred with a female horse. This produced a female hybrid with zebra stripes on its back and legs. <a href="Lord%20Morton%27s%20mare">Lord Morton's mare</a> was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>. This led to new ideas on <a href="telegony%20%28pregnancy%29">telegony</a>, referred to as <a href="pangenesis">pangenesis</a> by <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>. At the close of the 19th century, the Scottish zoologist <a href="James%20Cossar%20Ewart">James Cossar Ewart</a> argued against these ideas and proved, with several cross-breeding experiments, that zebra stripes can pop up as an <a href="Atavism">atavistic</a> trait at any time.

The quagga was long regarded a suitable candidate for domestication, as it counted as the most docile of the striped horses. The earliest Dutch colonists in South Africa had already fantasized about this possibility, because their imported work horses did not perform very well in the extreme climate and regularly fell prey to the feared <a href="African%20horse%20sickness">African horse sickness</a>. In 1843, the English naturalist <a href="Charles%20Hamilton%20Smith">Charles Hamilton Smith</a> wrote that the quagga was 'unquestionably best calculated for domestication, both as regards strength and docility'. Only a few descriptions have been given of tame or domesticated quaggas in South Africa. In Europe, the only confirmed cases are two stallions driven in a phaeton by Joseph Wilfred Parkins, sheriff of London in 1819-1820, and the quaggas and their hybrid offspring of London Zoo, which were used to pull a cart and transport vegetables from the market to the zoo. Nevertheless, the reveries continued long after the death of the last quagga in 1883. In 1889, the naturalist Henry Bryden wrote: "That an animal so beautiful, so capable of domestication and use, and to be found not long since in so great abundance, should have been allowed to be swept from the face of the earth, is surely a disgrace to our latter-day civilization." 
The specimen in London died in 1872 and the one in Berlin in 1875. The last captive quagga, a female in Amsterdam's <a href="Natura%20Artis%20Magistra">Natura Artis Magistra</a> zoo, lived there from 9 May 1867 until it died on 12 August 1883, but its origin and cause of death are unclear. Its death was not recognised as signifying the extinction of its kind at the time, and the zoo requested another specimen; hunters believed it could still be found "closer to the interior" in the Cape Colony. Since locals used the term quagga to refer to all zebras, this may have led to the confusion. The extinction of the quagga was internationally accepted by the 1900 <a href="Convention%20for%20the%20Preservation%20of%20Wild%20Animals%2C%20Birds%20and%20Fish%20in%20Africa">Convention for the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa</a>. The last specimen was featured on a Dutch stamp in 1988. There are 23 known stuffed and mounted quagga specimens throughout the world, including a juvenile, two foals, and a foetus. In addition, a mounted head and neck, a foot, seven complete skeletons, and samples of various tissues remain. A 24th mounted specimen was destroyed in <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a>, Germany, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and various skeletons and bones have also been lost.

After the very close relationship between the quagga and extant plains zebras was discovered, Reinhold Rau started the Quagga Project in 1987 in South Africa to create a quagga-like zebra population by <a href="selectively%20breeding">selectively breeding</a> for a reduced stripe pattern from plains zebra stock, with the eventual aim of introducing them to the quagga's former range. To differentiate between the quagga and the zebras of the project, they refer to it as "Rau quaggas". The founding population consisted of 19 individuals from Namibia and South Africa, chosen because they had reduced striping on the rear body and legs. The first foal of the project was born in 1988. Once a sufficiently quagga-like population has been created, participants in the project plan to release them in the Western Cape.

Introduction of these quagga-like zebras could be part of a comprehensive restoration programme, including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third- and fourth-generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called <a href="breeding%20back">breeding back</a>. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.

Rugby World Cup

The Rugby World Cup is a men's <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> tournament contested every four years between the top international teams. The tournament was first held in 1987, when the tournament was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia. 

The winners are awarded the <a href="Webb%20Ellis%20Cup">Webb Ellis Cup</a>, named after <a href="William%20Webb%20Ellis">William Webb Ellis</a>, the <a href="Rugby%20School">Rugby School</a> pupil who, according to a popular legend, invented rugby by picking up the ball during a football game. Four countries have won the trophy; New Zealand three times, <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a> and <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">South Africa</a> each twice, and <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a> once. <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand</a> are the current champions, having defeated <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a> in the final of the <a href="2015%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2015 tournament</a> in <a href="England">England</a>.

The tournament is administered by <a href="World%20Rugby">World Rugby</a>, the sport's international governing body. Sixteen teams were invited to participate in the inaugural tournament in 1987, however since 1999 twenty teams have taken part. Japan will host the <a href="2019%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2019 Rugby World Cup</a> and France will host <a href="2023%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">in 2023</a>.

Qualifying tournaments were introduced for the <a href="1991%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">second tournament</a>, where eight of the sixteen places were contested in a twenty-four-nation tournament. The <a href="1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">inaugural World Cup</a> in 1987, did not involve any qualifying process; instead, the 16 places were automatically filled by seven eligible <a href="World%20Rugby">International Rugby Football Board</a> (IRFB, now World Rugby) member nations, and the rest by invitation.

In 2003 and 2007, the qualifying format allowed for eight of the twenty available positions to be filled by automatic qualification, as the eight quarter finalists of the previous tournament enter its successor. The remaining twelve positions were filled by <a href="continent">continent</a>al qualifying tournaments. Positions were filled by three teams from the Americas, one from Asia, one from Africa, three from Europe and two from Oceania. Another two places were allocated for <a href="repechage">repechage</a>. The first repechage place was determined by a match between the runners-up from the Africa and Europe qualifying tournaments, with that winner then playing the Americas runner-up to determine the place. The second repechage position was determined between the runners-up from the Asia and Oceania qualifiers.

The current format allows for 12 of the 20 available positions to be filled by automatic qualification, as the teams who finish third or better in the group (pool) stages of the previous tournament enter its successor (where they will be <a href="Single-elimination%20tournament%23Seeding">seeded</a>). The qualification system for the remaining eight places is region-based, with a total eight teams allocated for Europe, five for Oceania, three for the Americas, two for Africa, and one for Asia. The last place is determined by an intercontinental play-off.

The 2015 tournament involved twenty nations competing over six weeks. There were two stages, a pool and a knockout. Nations were divided into four pools, A through to D, of five nations each. The teams were <a href="seed%20%28sports%29">seeded</a> before the start of the tournament, with the seedings taken from the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Rankings">World Rankings</a> in December 2012. The four highest-ranked teams were drawn into pools A to D. The next four highest-ranked teams were then drawn into pools A to D, followed by the next four. The remaining positions in each pool were filled by the qualifiers.

Nations play four pool games, playing their respective pool members once each. A <a href="Rugby%20union%20bonus%20points%20system">bonus points system</a> is used during pool play. If two or more teams are level on points, a system of criteria is used to determine the higher ranked; the sixth and final criterion decides the higher rank through the official World Rankings.

The winner and runner-up of each pool enter the knockout stage. The knockout stage consists of quarter- and semi-finals, and then the final. The winner of each pool is placed against a runner-up of a different pool in a quarter-final. The winner of each quarter-final goes on to the semi-finals, and the respective winners proceed to the final. Losers of the semi-finals contest for third place, called the 'Bronze Final'. If a match in the knockout stages ends in a draw, the winner is determined through <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a>. If that fails, the match goes into <a href="sudden%20death%20%28sport%29">sudden death</a> and the next team to score any points is the winner. As a last resort, a kicking competition is used.

Prior to the Rugby World Cup, there was no truly global rugby union competition, but there were a number of other tournaments. One of the oldest is the annual <a href="Six%20Nations%20Championship">Six Nations Championship</a>, which started in 1883 as the <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a> Championship, a tournament between <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a>, <a href="Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Ireland</a>, <a href="Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Scotland</a> and <a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wales</a>. It expanded to the Five Nations in 1910, when <a href="France%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">France</a> joined the tournament. France did not participate from 1931 to 1939, during which period it reverted to a Home Nations championship. In 2000, <a href="Italy%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Italy</a> joined the competition, which became the Six Nations.

Rugby union was also played at the <a href="Summer%20Olympic%20Games">Summer Olympic Games</a>, first appearing at the <a href="1900%20Summer%20Olympics">1900 Paris games</a> and subsequently at <a href="1908%20Summer%20Olympics">London in 1908</a>, <a href="1920%20Summer%20Olympics">Antwerp in 1920</a>, and <a href="1924%20Summer%20Olympics">Paris again in 1924</a>. France won the first gold medal, then Australasia, with the last two being won by the United States. However rugby union ceased to be on Olympic program after 1924.

The idea of a Rugby World Cup had been suggested on numerous occasions going back to the 1950s, but met with opposition from most unions in the IRFB. The idea resurfaced several times in the early 1980s, with the <a href="Australian%20Rugby%20Union">Australian Rugby Union</a> (ARU) in 1983, and the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Rugby%20Union">New Zealand Rugby Union</a> (NZRU) in 1984 independently proposing the establishment of a world cup. A proposal was again put to the IRFB in 1985 and this time successfully passed 10–6. The delegates from Australia, France, New Zealand and South Africa all voted for the proposal, and the delegates from Ireland and Scotland against; the English and Welsh delegates were split, with one from each country for and one against.

The inaugural tournament, jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand, was held in May and June 1987, with sixteen nations taking part. <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand</a> became the first ever champions, defeating <a href="France%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">France</a> 29–9 in the final. The subsequent <a href="1991%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1991 tournament</a> was hosted by England, with matches played throughout Britain, Ireland and France. This tournament saw the introduction of a qualifying tournament; eight places were allocated to the quarter-finalists from 1987, and the remaining eight decided by a thirty-five nation qualifying tournament. <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a> won the second tournament, defeating <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a> 12–6 in the final.

In 1992, eight years after their last official series, <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">South Africa</a> hosted New Zealand in a one-off test match. The resumption of international rugby in South Africa came after the dismantling of the <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> system, and was only done with permission of the <a href="African%20National%20Congress">African National Congress</a>. With their return to test rugby, South Africa were selected to host the <a href="1995%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1995 Rugby World Cup</a>. After upsetting Australia in the opening match, South Africa continued to advance through the tournament until they met New Zealand in the final. After a tense final that went into <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29">extra time</a>, South Africa emerged 15–12 winners, with then President <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>, wearing a Springbok <a href="Rugby%20shirt">jersey</a>, presenting the trophy to South Africa's captain, <a href="Francois%20Pienaar">Francois Pienaar</a>.

The tournament in <a href="1999%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1999</a> was hosted by Wales with matches also being held throughout the rest of the United Kingdom, Ireland and France. The tournament included a <a href="repechage">repechage</a> system, alongside specific regional qualifying places, and an increase from sixteen to twenty participating nations. Australia claimed their second title, defeating France in the final.

The <a href="2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2003 event</a> was hosted by Australia, although it was originally intended to be held jointly with New Zealand. England emerged as champions defeating Australia in extra time. England's win was unique in that it broke the <a href="SANZAAR">southern hemisphere</a>'s dominance in the event. Such was the celebration of England's victory, that an estimated 750,000 people gathered in central <a href="London">London</a> to greet the team, making the day the largest sporting celebration of its kind ever in the United Kingdom.

The <a href="2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2007 competition</a> was hosted by France, with matches also being held in Wales and Scotland. South Africa claimed their second title by defeating defending champions England 15–6. The <a href="2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2011 tournament</a> was awarded to New Zealand in November 2005, ahead of bids from <a href="Japan">Japan</a> and South Africa. The All Blacks reclaimed their place atop the rugby world with a narrow 8–7 win over France in the 2011 final.

In the <a href="2015%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2015 edition of tournament</a>, hosted by England, New Zealand once again won the final, this time against established rivals, Australia. In doing so, they became the first team in World Cup history to win three titles, as well as the first to successfully defend a title. It was also New Zealand's first title victory on foreign soil.

The Webb Ellis Cup is the prize presented to winners of the Rugby World Cup, named after <a href="William%20Webb%20Ellis">William Webb Ellis</a>. The trophy is also referred to simply as the "Rugby World Cup". The trophy was chosen in 1987 as an appropriate cup for use in the competition, and was created in 1906 by Garrard's Crown Jewellers. The trophy is restored after each game by fellow Royal Warrant holder <a href="Thomas%20Lyte">Thomas Lyte</a>. The words 'The International Rugby Football Board' and 'The Webb Ellis Cup' are engraved on the face of the cup. It stands thirty-eight centimetres high and is silver gilded in gold, and supported by two cast scroll handles, one with the head of a <a href="satyr">satyr</a>, and the other a head of a <a href="nymph">nymph</a>. In Australia the trophy is colloquially known as "Bill" — a reference to William Webb Ellis.

Tournaments are organised by Rugby World Cup Ltd (RWCL), which is itself owned by World Rugby. The selection of host is decided by a vote of World Rugby Council members. The voting procedure is managed by a team of independent auditors, and the voting kept secret. The allocation of a tournament to a host nation is now made five or six years prior to the commencement of the event, for example New Zealand were awarded the 2011 event in late 2005.

The tournament has been hosted by multiple nations. For example, the 1987 tournament was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. World Rugby requires that the hosts must have a venue with a capacity of at least 60,000 spectators for the final. Host nations sometimes construct or upgrade stadia in preparation for the World Cup, such as <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> – purpose built for the 1999 tournament – and <a href="Eden%20Park">Eden Park</a>, upgraded for 2011. The first country outside of the traditional rugby nations of <a href="SANZAAR">SANZAAR</a> or the Six Nations to be awarded the hosting rights was Japan, who will host the <a href="2019%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2019 tournament</a>. France will host the <a href="2023%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2023 tournament</a>.

Organizers of the Rugby World Cup, as well as the Global Sports Impact, state that the Rugby World Cup is the third largest sporting event in the World, behind only the <a href="FIFA%20World%20Cup">FIFA World Cup</a> and the <a href="Olympics">Olympics</a>, although other sources question whether this is accurate.

Reports emanating from World Rugby and its business partners have frequently touted the tournament's media growth, with cumulative worldwide television audiences of 300 million for the inaugural 1987 tournament, 1.75 billion in 1991, 2.67 billion in 1995, 3 billion in 1999, 3.5 billion in 2003, and 4 billion in 2007. The 4 billion figure was widely dismissed as the global audience for television is estimated to be about 4.2 billion.

However, independent reviews have called into question the methodology of those growth estimates, pointing to factual inconsistencies. The event's supposed drawing power outside of a handful of rugby strongholds was also downplayed significantly, with an estimated 97 percent of the 33 million average audience produced by the 2007 final coming from <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>, South Africa, the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> and France. Other sports have been accused of exaggerating their television reach over the years; such claims are not exclusive to the Rugby World Cup.

While the event's global popularity remains a matter of dispute, high interest in traditional rugby nations is well documented. The 2003 final, between Australia and England, became the most watched <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> match in the history of Australian television.

Notes:

Twenty-five nations have participated at the Rugby World Cup (excluding qualifying tournaments). Of the eight tournaments that have been held, all but one have been won by a national team from the <a href="southern%20hemisphere">southern hemisphere</a>. The southern hemisphere's dominance has been broken only in 2003, when England beat Australia in the final.

Thus far the only nations to host and win a tournament are New Zealand (1987 and 2011) and South Africa (1995). The performance of other host nations includes England (1991 final hosts) and Australia (2003 hosts) finishing runners-up. France (2007 hosts) finished fourth, while Wales (1999 hosts) failed to reach the semi-finals. Wales became the first host nation to be eliminated at the pool stages in 1991, while, England became the first solo host nation to be eliminated at the pool stages in 2015. Of the twenty-five nations that have ever participated in at least one tournament, eleven of them have never missed a tournament.

The record for most points overall is held by English player <a href="Jonny%20Wilkinson">Jonny Wilkinson</a>, who scored 277 over his World Cup career. <a href="Grant%20Fox">Grant Fox</a> of New Zealand holds the record for most points in one competition, with 126 in 1987; <a href="Jason%20Leonard">Jason Leonard</a> of England holds the record for most World Cup matches: 22 between 1991 and 2003. <a href="Simon%20Culhane">Simon Culhane</a> holds the record for most points in a match by one player, 45, as well as the record for most conversions in a match, 20. <a href="Marc%20Ellis%20%28rugby%20footballer%29">Marc Ellis</a> holds the record for most tries in a match, six, which he scored against Japan in 1995.
