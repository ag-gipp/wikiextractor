George Hirst

George Herbert Hirst (7 September 1871 – 10 May 1954) was a professional English <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> for <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire County Cricket Club</a> between 1891 and 1921, with a further appearance in 1929. He played in 24 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> between 1897 and 1909, touring Australia twice. One of the best <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a>s of his time, Hirst was a left arm <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">medium-fast</a> bowler and right-handed batsman. He completed the <a href="Double%20%28cricket%29">double</a> of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in an English cricket season 14 times, the second most of any cricketer after his contemporary and team-mate <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a>. One of the <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">"Wisden" Cricketers of the Year</a> for 1901, Hirst scored 36,356 runs and took 2,742 wickets in first-class cricket. In Tests, he made 790 runs and captured 59 wickets.

Born in <a href="Kirkheaton">Kirkheaton</a>, Hirst first achieved success for Yorkshire as a bowler who could bat a little. Over his first few seasons, his batting developed at the expense of his bowling until he was regarded mainly as a specialist batsman. Around 1900, his bowling re-emerged when he discovered a method to make the ball <a href="Swing%20bowling">swing</a> in the air after he released it. He was one of the first bowlers to control the swing of the ball; batsmen found it very difficult to counter this method and Hirst's bowling was subsequently far more successful. From 1903 he achieved 11 consecutive doubles. He set records in 1905, when he scored 341 runs in an innings against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>—still the highest total for Yorkshire as of 2015—and in 1906, when he completed an unprecedented and unrepeated double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. In many seasons, he battled injury which reduced his effectiveness, but his bowling remained successful until shortly before the First World War. Hirst played in all England's home Test series between 1899 and 1909, but his record for England was less impressive than his record for Yorkshire and he may have suffered from playing in Australia where playing conditions did not suit him.

Hirst returned to play for Yorkshire after the war, but became a cricket coach at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> in 1920, where he remained until 1938. After making occasional appearances in 1920 and 1921, he retired from regular first-class cricket. He maintained his connections with Yorkshire for the rest of his life, coached young players and established an excellent reputation for developing players of all social backgrounds. A popular player, coach and personality with cricketers and spectators, Hirst died in 1954, aged 82.

Hirst was born on 7 September 1871 in the Brown Cow Inn, <a href="Kirkheaton">Kirkheaton</a>, a village close to <a href="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a>. He was the last of 10 children born to James Hirst and his wife Sarah Maria Woolhouse. When his father died in 1880, Hirst lived with his sister Mary Elizabeth Woolhouse and her husband John Berry in Kirkheaton. After leaving school at 10 years of age, Hirst first worked for a hand-loom weaver in a local cottage, and then at a dyeing firm. He played <a href="rugby%20football">rugby football</a> as a <a href="Fullback%20%28rugby%20union%29">full back</a> during winter, and cricket with his friends and brothers in summer. By the age of 15, Hirst was playing regularly for the Kirkheaton cricket team and his batting and bowling performances regularly won prizes from a local newspaper. His reputation grew; when he was 18 he was a key player in the Kirkheaton team which won the Lumb Challenge Cup of 1889. In the final, watched by players from <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire County Cricket Club</a>, he took five wickets for 23 runs. Days later, invited to take part along with another local player, he appeared for Yorkshire against Cheshire in a non-<a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> match in Huddersfield. He scored six runs in his only innings, and took three wickets in the match.

Hirst played only intermittently for Yorkshire over the next couple of seasons, but continued to develop as a cricketer, signing as a professional for <a href="Elland">Elland</a> Cricket Club for the 1890 season before joining <a href="Mirfield">Mirfield</a> in 1891. During that season, he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a> in the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a>; he scored 15 runs and took two wickets in the game.

For the 1892 season, Hirst joined Huddersfield, which played a higher standard of cricket. Yorkshire also gave him a longer run in the first team. Early in the season, Hirst appeared for Yorkshire against the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC). Not considered a good batsman at this stage, he batted at <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Lower%20order%20or%20tail">number 11</a> in the first innings, scored 20 and 43 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> and, as a bowler, took four wickets for 29 runs (four for 29) and two for 58. His bowling performance particularly impressed <a href="Sydney%20Pardon">Sydney Pardon</a>, the editor of "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>". Yorkshire, needing to fill a vacant place in the team, played Hirst 13 times in first-class matches in 1892. He did not pass 30 runs in an innings again and <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">averaged</a> 16.15 with the bat. With the ball, he took 30 wickets at an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of 20.56 with a best performance of six for 16 against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>. "Wisden" later noted that Hirst, until he tired later in the season and was dropped from the team, "bowled up to a certain point with excellent results".

Over the next few seasons, Hirst became a regular member of the Yorkshire side, but although his performances were good enough to keep him in the team, he had few outstanding successes. "Wisden" noted: "For some time after his first season Hirst's career was one of steady progress rather than of brilliant achievement." Hirst's batting remained undeveloped in 1893; he batted at number 10 and did not pass fifty in any one innings, though he managed some useful scores. He averaged only 15.04 with the bat, but his bowling continued to make a good impression on critics. He took 99 wickets at an average of 14.39, placing him third in the Yorkshire averages for the season; that year, the county won the official <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a>, which had begun in 1890, for the first time. In 1894, Hirst scored his maiden first-class century against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a>, hitting an unbeaten 115 out of a partnership of 176 for the ninth <a href="Wicket%23Partnership">wicket</a>. Although this was his only score over fifty, "Wisden" recorded how his batting often helped his team out of difficult situations. In total, he hit 564 runs at an average of 16.58. With the ball, his record was similar to the previous season. He took 98 wickets at an average of 15.98, and his best figures came in a match against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>, a feat appreciated by Yorkshire supporters as the fixture was always highly competitive. Then in the 1895 season, Hirst passed 100 wickets in the season for the first time, securing 150 wickets at an average of 17.06. He established himself as an opening bowler for Yorkshire, assuming the role from <a href="Ted%20Wainwright">Ted Wainwright</a> and developing a good partnership with <a href="Bobby%20Peel">Bobby Peel</a>. Against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>, he took a <a href="Hat-trick%23Cricket">hat-trick</a>. Although primarily regarded as a bowler, and while "Wisden" later described his batting as being in "temporary decline" in 1895, Hirst also scored 710 runs at an average of 19.18, with three fifties.

In 1896, Yorkshire won their second County Championship. Hirst hit a century against Leicestershire and nine other scores over fifty; this improvement in his batting took him past 1,000 runs for the first time, and his average of 28.05 was substantially higher than he had achieved previously. With the ball he took 104 wickets, at the more expensive average of 21.61, to complete <a href="Double%20%28cricket%29">the double</a> of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets for the first time. However, some critics in Yorkshire were unhappy that his batting had improved, believing that the extra effort involved would diminish his effectiveness as a bowler. They considered a powerful bowling attack to be vital to the team's success, more so than a strong batting line-up, and expressed the opinion that Hirst should concentrate on one discipline rather than dividing his energy. Over the next few seasons, these fears were proven to some extent, "Wisden" noting in 1901 that he was a less effective bowler than previously. In 1897, Hirst completed the double again. He scored 1,535 runs at an average of 35.69, with a century and 11 fifties, and took 101 wickets at an average of 23.22. These performances were good enough to earn him selection for <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">the Players against the Gentlemen</a> in the prestigious matches at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> and <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, in both of which he scored half-centuries.

For the winter of 1897–98, Hirst was selected as part of <a href="Andrew%20Stoddart">Andrew Stoddart</a>'s team to tour Australia. The team was outplayed and lost the Test matches 4–1, hampered by the poor form of the bowlers and ill health among the team, not least from Stoddart himself who missed several matches following the death of his mother. Hirst, suffering from a strained leg for some of the tour, was ineffective as a bowler. The hard Australian pitches favoured batsmen and did not suit Hirst's style of bowling. In all the first-class matches on the tour, he took only nine wickets at the very expensive average of 75.77. His batting was inconsistent and he scored 338 runs at an average of 21.12. His best scores came in minor matches. Nevertheless, he was selected for England in four of the five Test matches. His debut came in the first match, England's only victory, when he scored 62 batting at number six in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">batting order</a>. Despite bowling 41 <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a> in the game, he failed to take a wicket; his maiden Test match wicket came in the following Test, but he took only two wickets in the series. In the third Test, Hirst scored 85, which remained the highest Test score of his career, but in this series he reached double figures only once more. When the series ended, Hirst had scored 207 runs at an average of 29.57.

Hirst's poor form continued when he returned to England for the 1898 season. Fatigue from continuous cricket and ongoing problems with his leg added to his difficulties and he had a poor season. His only score over fifty was an innings of 130 against Surrey, and he scored 567 runs at an average of 17.71. Statistically, he had one of his worst bowling seasons, taking 36 wickets at 25.61 and never taking more than four wickets in an innings. For Yorkshire, Hirst's loss of form was offset by the debut of <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a>, also from Kirkheaton, who took 154 wickets in his first season. In 1899, Hirst showed a big improvement in his batting form, scoring 1,630 runs—his best tally to date—at an average of 35.43. He increased his number of wickets to 82 at 24.75, and his form was good enough to earn selection for his first home Test match, against Australia. However, it was only injuries to three other candidates that secured his place as a fast bowler, and he was not selected in the rest of the series. "Wisden" noted: "It cannot be said that the experiment was in any way a success. Hirst worked hard for his side, his fielding indeed being perfection, but as a bowler he did not cause the Australians any trouble." When he played the tourists in their game against Yorkshire soon after the Test, Hirst took 13 wickets. Later in the season, he played for the Players against the Gentlemen, though without any great success.

Hirst's batting continued to be more successful than his bowling, to the point where commentators regarded him as primarily a batsman, who bowled occasionally. In 1900, he scored 1,960 runs at an average of 40.83, his best batting record to date, but his total of wickets fell to 62 at an average of 26.90, his worst average until 1914. His only representative cricket came in end-of-season festival matches, including a Gentlemen v Players match. Yorkshire won the County Championship, the first of three consecutive victories in which Hirst played a leading role. After his achievements in the season, Hirst was selected as one of "Wisden's" <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>. The citation described him as a confident batsman who could be relied upon in difficult batting conditions or when his team were under pressure, but noted how his bowling had suffered as he improved as a batsman. However, around this time, Hirst began to develop his use of <a href="swing%20bowling">swing bowling</a>, known at the time as swerve bowling. Previously, the ball occasionally swung through the air without his deliberate intention after he released it, but he now discovered a method to control the "swerve" in certain atmospheric conditions. He never discussed how he achieved the effect, limiting his comments to "sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't."

In the 1901 season, Hirst's improvement in bowling brought him the highest total of wickets in his career to date. In a summer of sunny weather which brought a succession of good batting pitches, he took 183 wickets, the first time since 1897 he had passed 100 wickets, at an average of 16.38. This placed him second in the national averages behind Rhodes. He recorded a series of impressive bowling performances, winning extravagant praise from "Wisden"; he took five wickets in an innings on 15 occasions and 10 wickets in a match five times, including once against traditional rivals Lancashire. His batting continued to be successful, and he completed his second double with 1,950 runs at 42.39, including his first double-century: 214 against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>. He was selected for the Gentlemen and Players match at Lord's, and appeared in the equivalent fixture in an end-of-season festival match.

Although both were invited, neither Hirst nor Rhodes toured Australia in the winter of 1901–02 with <a href="Archie%20MacLaren">Archie MacLaren</a>'s team, as the Yorkshire committee wanted both players to be well rested before the new season. Hirst was statistically less successful in 1902, but he nevertheless returned to the Test team. The summer was very wet, resulting in many rain-affected pitches, known as <a href="sticky%20wicket">sticky wicket</a>s, which favoured slower bowlers and made batting difficult. Hirst scored 1,413 runs in the season, at an average of 31.11 with two centuries. He took fewer wickets than the previous year, partly as he was often used for a few overs early in an innings by Yorkshire before giving way to slow bowlers Rhodes and <a href="Schofield%20Haigh">Schofield Haigh</a>, who topped the national first-class bowling averages for the season. In total, Hirst took 83 wickets at an average of 20.33.

During the summer of 1902, Australia toured England, playing five Test matches; Hirst made an impact on the series. Around the time of the first Test, the tourists endured a dispiriting spell of poor form and illness. In the first Test, England scored 376 for nine wickets. Hirst scored 48 and "Wisden" described his partnership with <a href="Johnny%20Tyldesley">Johnny Tyldesley</a> of 94 in 80 minutes as the turning point of the innings. In reply, Hirst and Rhodes bowled out Australia for 36 in conditions that the umpires considered reasonable to bat in. "Wisden" described the two Yorkshiremen as bowling very well. Hirst had figures of three for 15 and Rhodes returned seven for 17. However <a href="C.%20B.%20Fry">C. B. Fry</a>, who played for England in the match, believed Hirst to be the more difficult to play and that while Rhodes bowled well, the Australian batsmen got themselves out as they "hurried to the other end and tried to hit Rhodes, without success. Well as Rhodes bowled, it was Hirst who was responsible for the debacle. This is the best instance I know of the bowler at the other end getting wickets for his colleague." The England side for this match was later described by some critics as the greatest England team in history. Rain prevented the match from being completed and saved Australia from almost certain defeat. The Australian team's next game was against Yorkshire. Hirst took four for 35 in the tourist's first innings, but in a low-scoring game, Yorkshire were behind after the first innings. After Australia had reached 20 for three wickets in their second innings, Hirst bowled <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a> with what Hirst believed was the best delivery of his life and the tourists last wickets fell quickly. The team were bowled out for 23, of which Hirst took five wickets for nine runs as he made the ball swing. Yorkshire lost five wickets in scoring the 48 runs they required to win.

The second Test was badly affected by weather and Hirst did not bat or bowl, and in the third Test in Sheffield, lost by England, he scored eight runs and did not take any wickets. Although he failed at Sheffield, Hirst was the leading all-rounder in England and thus unlikely to be left out of the team. However, the England captain, Archie MacLaren, was engaged in a dispute with the team selectors over the composition of his side. He was given only 12 players to choose from for the fourth Test. <a href="Fred%20Tate">Fred Tate</a> was one of the twelve and the selectors probably included him as they believed MacLaren could not possibly choose him in the final eleven over another player and so would be forced to field the side they wanted. MacLaren responded by dropping Hirst to play Tate, out of anger towards the selectors. The pitch was soft, which would have favoured the bowling of Tate, but "Wisden" reported that while this offered some justification for dropping Hirst, "it meant playing a bowler pure and simple in preference to a first-rate all-round man, and the result proved anything but happy." Tate bowled just 16 overs in the game, dropped a vital catch and was the last man out as Australia won the match by three runs, giving them an unassailable lead in the series; later writers claimed that Tate's performance was responsible for losing the match.

Hirst was recalled for the final Test and played a vital role. "Wisden" said that he bowled as well as he had in 1901 as he brought about an early batting collapse. Although Australia recovered, he had figures of five for 77. With <a href="Len%20Braund">Len Braund</a>, Hirst then helped England to avoid the <a href="follow-on">follow-on</a>, scoring 43 and according to "Wisden" "hitting with the utmost freedom." Hirst took a further wicket as Australia were dismissed for 121. England, needing 263 to win, were 48 for five at one point but an innings of 104 from <a href="Gilbert%20Jessop">Gilbert Jessop</a> gave England a chance. Hirst scored 58 not out, making an aggressive start but slowing down to score mainly from singles in the later stages of the innings as wickets were lost. The ninth wicket fell with 15 needed when Rhodes joined Hirst. It has been claimed that Hirst said to Rhodes, "We'll get 'em in singles", but neither batsman could remember those words being said and not all the runs came in singles. The two Yorkshiremen held their nerve to take England to a one-wicket victory. "Wisden" described Hirst as playing "a great game", noted the coolness of his play under pressure and said that "Hirst's innings was in its way almost as remarkable as Jessop's".

In four Tests, Hirst scored 157 runs at an average of 39.25 and took nine wickets at an average of 23.11. Apart from his Test appearances, Hirst also played twice for the Players against the Gentlemen and played for the same side against the Australians.

Early in the 1903 season, Hirst suffered a leg injury. This, coupled with other players' absences, was partly responsible for a poor start to the season by Yorkshire, and although the team recovered, it could only achieve third place in the County Championship. When Hirst returned his bowling speed was reduced, but during the season he rediscovered his swing bowling. In completing the first of 10 consecutive doubles, he took 128 wickets at an average of 14.94 and scored 1,844 runs at an average of 47.28. For Yorkshire, he topped both the batting and bowling averages and had the third highest batting average in the country. Hirst played in two end-of-season games for the Players against the Gentlemen; his 124 not out in the second match was his only century in the Players versus Gentlemen series.

In 1903, <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a>, who played for <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>, was chosen to captain the first tour of Australia to be sponsored by MCC, in the winter of 1903–04. According to Warner, Hirst and Rhodes were the first two players to be selected, as "the two best bowlers of the present day in this country." Before the tour, critics claimed Hirst would be unsuccessful, citing his failure during his previous tour. However, Warner later wrote: "Hirst, to say nothing of his batting, bowled excellently throughout the tour, and was of much more value as a bowler than his average would suggest". He further described him as the best all-rounder in England and noted that "the tighter the match, the better he plays". "Wisden" was less convinced, and the report on the tour said that, as a bowler, "Hirst, though by no means the failure he had been with Mr Stoddart's team six years before, fell far below his English form." While commenting on his batting record, the "Wisden" report noted: "The Australian wickets [i.e. pitches] in fine weather are rather too fast to suit the pulling and hook strokes of which he is such a master in England." As he could not make the ball swing in Australia in the same way it did in England, Hirst used <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a>, bowling at <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29%23Part%20of%20the%20wicket">leg stump</a> with fielders close by on the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a>.

In his second match of the tour, Hirst scored 92 and used his pull shot more effectively than on other occasions. He followed this with 66 in the third match but did not take many wickets before the first Test. Warner considered he had nevertheless bowled well but was finding it difficult to maintain his energy in the hot conditions; his bowling lost pace and sting later in his bowling spells. Hirst played in all five Test matches, the first two of which were won by England. In the first game, Hirst took two wickets. In his first innings, he scored a <a href="Duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> and was dropped by <a href="Frank%20Laver">Frank Laver</a> before he had scored in the second. He survived to score 60 not out and his partnership with <a href="Tom%20Hayward">Tom Hayward</a> guided England to victory after wickets had fallen early chasing a target of 194. Hirst scored 11 runs in the second match and took three wickets on a difficult batting pitch, badly affected by rain. Although this performance was not statistically impressive, Warner thought he bowled very well. During the third Test, Hirst took three wickets and, with innings of 58 and 44, was one of the few successful England batsmen in a poor performance which enabled Australia to win the match. England won the crucial fourth match to ensure the series victory. Hirst took two wickets and contributed scores of 25 and 18. Australia achieved a win in the final match in which Hirst scored 0 and 1, but after taking no wickets in the first innings he achieved his best Test figures of the tour in the second, with five for 48.

In the Test series, Hirst scored 217 runs at an average of 24.11 and took 15 wickets at an average of 30.06. He scored 569 runs at 33.47 and took 36 wickets at 24.50 over all first-class games on the tour. His best bowling performance was five for 37 against Tasmania. Warner described Hirst as a very consistent batsman throughout the tour, and noted that while he was a less effective bowler in Australian conditions than at home, he was often unlucky.

After returning to England, Hirst completed another double in 1904. Although a leg injury reduced the pace and effectiveness of his bowling for much of the season, he scored 2,501 runs at an average of 54.36, the highest aggregate and average of his career, and took 132 wickets at 21.09. He became the first Yorkshire player to achieve the double of 2,000 runs and 100 wickets, a feat previously achieved only by the <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a> trio of <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Townsend">Charlie Townsend</a> and <a href="Gilbert%20Jessop">Gilbert Jessop</a>. Most of his eight centuries were either against the strongest counties or in adverse circumstances for the team. In August, Hirst had a <a href="Benefit%20%28sports%29">benefit match</a> against Lancashire from which he received £3,703, worth around £ as of , a very high sum for a benefit at the time, and his popularity was reflected in the attendance over three days of 78,792 spectators.

Yorkshire finished second to Lancashire in the County Championship in 1904 but regained the title in 1905. Hirst's leg-strain continued to cause him pain throughout the season and again hampered his bowling. Even so, he took 110 wickets at 19.94 and passed 2,000 runs for the second time, scoring 2,226 runs at an average of 53.95. Early in the season, Hirst scored 341 against Leicestershire, the highest score of his career and, as of 2015, the record individual innings by a Yorkshire batsman. On a good pitch for batting, he began his innings when Yorkshire had scored 22 for three wickets, in reply to Leicestershire's score of 419, batted just under seven hours and hit 53 fours and a six. Later that season, he scored another double century, hitting 232 not out against Surrey; only two other players reached double figures in the Yorkshire innings. In the same game, Hirst took five wickets for 43 runs.

Hirst's leg injury kept him out of the England side for the first two Test matches against Australia, although he would have been a certain selection had he been fit. He was chosen in the squad for the second match but was left out on fitness grounds. However, Hirst was not particularly successful in the three Tests he played that season, hitting a highest score of 40 not out; as a bowler he never took more than three wickets in an innings. In the series he scored 105 runs at an average of 35.00 and took 6 wickets at 35.33. England won the series 2–0, mainly due to the all-round efforts of Hirst's Yorkshire teammate <a href="Stanley%20Jackson">Stanley Jackson</a>, who headed the batting and bowling averages for the series.

In 1906, Hirst completed an unprecedented double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. Cricket writer <a href="A.%20A.%20Thomson">A. A. Thomson</a> noted that both milestones were unusual individually, and that such all-round achievements had only been matched in scope by those of W. G. Grace in the 1870s. No other cricketer has come close to matching this particular double. Hirst reached the 1,000 run–100 wicket double by the end of June, two weeks faster than anyone else in the history of first-class cricket. In total he scored 2,385 first-class runs at an average of 45.86 and took 208 wickets at 16.50. Hirst's contributions were particularly important in a close race for the County Championship. <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> were eventual champions after Yorkshire lost a close game to Gloucestershire, but Hirst performed well in the two matches against Kent. He scored a century and took 11 wickets as Yorkshire won the first, and took eight wickets and scored a match-saving 93 in the drawn second encounter. Against the other title contenders, Lancashire and Surrey, he was likewise successful with both bat and ball, earning praise from "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" and "Wisden" for his batting under difficult circumstances in these matches. His captain, <a href="Martin%20Hawke%2C%207th%20Baron%20Hawke">Lord Hawke</a>, said "It was not only what Georgie Hirst did but how he did it, coming off [i. e. "succeeding"] when an effort seemed most necessary and playing his best against the more formidable sides." He scored six centuries, two of which came in a record-equalling performance against Somerset. He scored 111 and 117 not out when batting and took six for 70 and five for 45 with the ball. He became only the second man after <a href="Bernard%20Bosanquet%20%28cricketer%29">Bernard Bosanquet</a> to score two centuries and take 10 wickets in the same first-class match; as of 2015, only one other man, <a href="Franklyn%20Stephenson">Franklyn Stephenson</a> in 1988, has achieved the feat. Battling a knee injury and exhaustion towards the end of the season, it became increasingly difficult for Hirst to perform. Hirst took his 200th wicket at the end of August and commented that, were his feat to be duplicated in future, "whoever does will be very tired". He also commented that his injuries only troubled him once the season was over and it "was a triumph of spirit over matter".

The weather was poor during the 1907 season, resulting in a succession of pitches which suited spin bowling and were difficult to bat on. In these circumstances, Hirst scored fewer runs than in the previous season. He did not score a century, making 1,321 runs at 28.71, and the prevalent type of pitches did not suit his bowling pace so that he took fewer wickets. Even so, he was the second highest wicket-taker in the season and came fifth in the bowling averages, with 183 wickets at 15.29. Hirst remained a first-choice member of the Test team, playing all three matches against <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201907">South Africa</a> that summer in a series which England won 1–0, with the other two games drawn. Although unsuccessful with the bat, achieving 46 runs in five innings with a top-score of 17, in a low-scoring second Test, Hirst was one of the few batsmen to handle the <a href="Googly">googlies</a> of <a href="Aubrey%20Faulkner">Aubrey Faulkner</a>. As a bowler he took 10 wickets at 18.50; of these wickets, six were in the final match of the series. Yorkshire won the County Championship again during the 1908 season. Hirst completed another double, scoring 1,598 runs at 38.97 and taking 174 wickets at 14.05, but was not selected for any other representative games until the end of the season. However, he declined an invitation to tour Australia with the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201907%E2%80%9308">MCC team in 1907–08</a>.

In the 1909 season, Hirst was less successful. Possibly affected by his heavy workload with bat and ball in previous seasons, his batting disappointed critics. He scored 1,256 runs at 27.30, his lowest batting average since 1898. With the ball, he took 115 wickets at 20.05; his best performances came in the more important matches such as those against Lancashire and Surrey. He was selected for the Players against the Gentlemen, taking seven wickets in the game. In the Test series against Australia, which England lost 2–1, Hirst played in the first four matches. England won the first game, in which Hirst took nine wickets. On the first day, bowling throughout the Australian innings with <a href="Colin%20Blythe">Colin Blythe</a>, Hirst took four for 28. The Australians were never comfortable; "Wisden" noted that Hirst "[made] the ball swerve in his most puzzling fashion". After England established a first innings lead, Australia were bowled out for 151 in their second innings, with Hirst taking five for 58. The English <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">opening batsmen</a> scored the 105 runs required for victory without being separated. Hirst and Blythe took all the wickets which fell to England in the match, a rare accomplishment, and apart from a brief period, bowled throughout the match without resting. However, Hirst was ineffective in the rest of the series, and was left out of the side for the fifth and final Test. In the series he scored 52 runs at an average of 8.66, with a top-score of 31, and took 16 wickets at 21.75. This ended his Test career; his final Test record in 24 matches was 790 runs, with three scores over fifty, at an average of 22.57, and 59 wickets at an average of 30.00.

Yorkshire had one of their worst seasons to date in 1910, finishing eighth in the County Championship and attracting disapproval from critics. Hirst led the Yorkshire batting and bowling averages and was the third highest wicket-taker in the country. He scored 1,840 runs at 32.85 and took 164 wickets at 14.79. One of his best performances came at Lord's, where he scored an unbeaten century to guide Yorkshire to a win against Middlesex. Against Lancashire he took nine for 23, the best bowling figures of his career, <a href="clean%20bowled">clean-bowling</a> eight of his victims as Lancashire were dismissed for 61. Yorkshire continued to struggle in 1911, but Hirst was successful against many of the leading counties, mainly as a bowler. However, he achieved some large scores; against Sussex, he hit the third double-century of his career and against Lancashire he scored 156 as well as taking six wickets for 83. In total, he scored 1,789 runs at 33.12 and took 137 wickets at 20.40. In 1912 Yorkshire regained the County Championship; Hirst's form that season was not as good as in previous years, but he batted well before poor weather and a knee injury interrupted his cricket. He hit one century and his performances with the ball were unspectacular. In all he scored 1,133 runs at an average of 25.75 and took 118 wickets at 17.37. Although both Australia and South Africa toured England, Hirst did not play any Tests and, for the first time since 1904, was not selected for the Players side in any of their matches.

Hirst completed the 14th and final double of his career in 1913, leading the Yorkshire batting averages with 1,540 runs at an average of 35.81. His bowling was not as effective and he was no longer Yorkshire's main attacking bowler, as <a href="Alonzo%20Drake">Alonzo Drake</a> and <a href="Major%20Booth">Major Booth</a> headed the averages. Hirst took 101 wickets at 20.13. During the following season, the last before the First World War, Hirst was further afflicted by injuries and missed some matches. He bowled far less frequently than in recent seasons and his 43 wickets, which cost 29.81, were his fewest since 1898; it was the first time since 1902 he failed to complete the double. His batting remained effective and he produced some good performances when his team were in difficult circumstances, although his two centuries were against the weaker bowling attacks of <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> and Somerset. He scored 1,670 runs at 41.75. In June, he was selected in a match to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the current Lord's ground, playing for the Rest of England against the MCC side which had toured South Africa the previous winter. The outbreak of war brought the season to an early close in August.

During the war Hirst, along with Rhodes and their team-mate <a href="Schofield%20Haigh">Schofield Haigh</a>, worked in a munitions factory in Huddersfield. Hirst and Rhodes were paid by Yorkshire to play in war-time cricket matches on a certain number of Saturdays. Hirst played in the <a href="Bradford%20Cricket%20League">Bradford League</a>, and became known among cricketers for accepting minimal fees from financially struggling clubs. When first-class cricket restarted in 1919, Hirst resumed playing for Yorkshire. In the first match of the season he hit an aggressive unbeaten 180 against MCC, to secure a draw for the county; he followed this with two more centuries in the first two weeks of the season. Although his form later faltered, he played some substantial innings in difficult circumstances and ended the season with 1,441 runs at an average of 38.94. He bowled infrequently, taking 18 wickets at 29.27. During this season, Hirst accepted the position of coach at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>. In the last match of the season, at Scarborough, he was given a warm reception by the crowd, who did not expect to see him playing for Yorkshire again. However, he appeared on occasions during the school holidays in the next two seasons, although he did not score any centuries, did not average more than 24 with the bat and took only 21 wickets in total. At the end of the 1921 season Hirst retired as a Yorkshire player, and made what was expected to be his final first-class appearance in a <a href="Scarborough%20Festival">Scarborough Festival</a> match, in which he captained the Players against the Gentlemen. On the last day of the match, Hirst's 50th birthday, he took the final two wickets to secure victory for his side. The crowd gathered outside the pavilion and demanded to see him; he gave a farewell speech, and was moved by the reception given to him.

Hirst played three more first-class games; in 1921–22 he played two games for the <a href="Europeans%20cricket%20team">Europeans cricket team</a> in India, and in 1929, aged 58, he made a final appearance for Yorkshire in a Scarborough Festival match against the MCC. He scored just one run before <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a> bowled him; Hirst reportedly commented: "A grand ball that, lad. I couldn't have played that one when I was good." In all first-class cricket, Hirst played 826 games, scored 36,356 runs at an average of 34.13 with 60 hundreds and took 2,742 wickets at 18.73.

Following his retirement as a player, Hirst occasionally umpired first-class matches, taking charge of at least one match at every Scarborough Festival between 1922 and 1938. He also umpired two matches on Yorkshire's tour of Jamaica in 1936, and a Minor Counties match between Yorkshire and Lancashire second teams.

From 1920 to 1938, Hirst was the cricket coach at Eton. The college's most important match was the <a href="Eton%20v%20Harrow">annual match against Harrow at Lord's</a>, and during Hirst's tenure, the team were unbeaten in the fixture, winning the six matches that produced a definite result and drawing the remainder. Following Hirst's retirement, Eton lost to Harrow in 1939 for the first time since the First World War. In the period of Hirst's coaching, Eton only lost once—in 1920—to Winchester. A combination of Hirst's technical knowledge, playing experience and empathy with young people made him a very successful coach. He taught technical proficiency, but encouraged his pupils to play their natural game. His "Times" obituary noted "his professional capacity earned him the respect of the boys and his natural good humour and good manners gained him the love of all." When he retired, a dinner was held in his honour at Eton.

While serving as the Eton coach, Hirst also worked with young Yorkshire players during the school holidays, and maintained his coaching connection with the county until shortly before his death. Despite the differences in the backgrounds of the players, Hirst was equally respected at Eton and when he acted as a coach to the Yorkshire team. At Yorkshire Hirst worked with young players in the cricket nets at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a>, took charge of indoor trials during the winter, and travelled with the team as coach on a tour to Jamaica in 1936. Many Yorkshire players, with vastly differing temperaments, came under his influence and improved as players. One of Hirst's most notable achievements as a coach was improving the bowling of <a href="George%20Macaulay">George Macaulay</a> to the point where he became a key member of the Yorkshire team.

Bill Bowes, who received coaching by Hirst and went on to play for England, described him as "the finest coach in the world". <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a>, another who was coached by Hirst, wrote "I shall always think of George Hirst as the ideal coach. He was a 'natural' one, the guide, the philosopher, and friend of every young fellow who has had a trial under him". Part of Hirst's success at Eton came from his personality and ability to extract the best from people. Bowes noted how his enthusiasm inspired young players, and his humour and kindness led boys to worship him. He could pass on technical knowledge in a way that was easy to comprehend, backed up with anecdotes to illustrate his point. Bowes described how "he had a rare skill in noting and demonstrating your faults and no less skill in illustrating the remedies".

Hirst received little coaching as a batsman. Physically brave, he was often at his best on pitches which were difficult for batting, and when his team faced a crisis. His usual approach was to bat aggressively. Although he could play defensively if required, he preferred to attack when his team were in difficulties. He played a variety of strokes, but he favoured the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">on drive</a> and particularly the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">pull and hook shots</a>. He was able to pull and hook almost any ball delivered to him, making it difficult to place fielders effectively while he was batting. Only in Australia did this approach prove less successful. He also established a reputation as an outstanding fielder at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">mid off</a>. In this position, he took many catches, often from hard drives in an era when batsmen played this shot very well.

Although Hirst was a right-handed batsman, he bowled with his left arm at <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">medium-fast</a> pace. He was one of the first bowlers to make the ball swerve through the air in a controlled fashion. According to A. A. Thomson, Hirst's development of swing bowling was almost as revolutionary as <a href="Bernard%20Bosanquet%20%28cricketer%29">Bernard Bosanquet's</a> invention of the <a href="googly">googly</a>. His bowling partnership with Rhodes was particularly effective, and established a formidable reputation. Hirst could not make the ball swing in every match, nor could he maintain it through a long innings. However, when he could achieve swerve, even the best batsmen found it almost impossible to bat against him. His success was dependent on atmospheric conditions; for example, he could not swing the ball much in Australia. He was particularly effective when bowling into the wind. <a href="Sammy%20Woods">Sammy Woods</a> described facing Hirst when the ball was moving in the air: "How the devil can you play a ball that comes in at you like a hard throw-in from cover-point?" Hirst was not an especially quick bowler, a little faster than <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">medium pace</a>, with a long run-up and a relaxed action. He usually bowled <a href="Cricket%20terminology%23O">over the wicket</a>, meaning he bowled from the right hand side of the wickets and therefore angled the ball across the pitch. After delivery, the ball swung through the air at the last minute and hurried through after pitching, appearing to get faster. A very accurate bowler, he was difficult to score against unless a batsman was prepared to hit him in the air over <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">mid on</a>. The main dangers to the batsmen were the risk of being bowled or hitting the ball with a defensive shot and being caught by specially-placed fielders on the leg side. His ability to make the ball swing made him effective on a variety of pitches. Before Hirst developed his technique, bowlers often rubbed the ball in the dirt to remove the shiny layer of the ball, unaware that this layer helped the ball to swing. Hirst's "Wisden" obituary records: "Hirst, in fact, has been described as the father of all modern seam and swing bowling."

Hirst completed the double 14 times, more than any other cricketer except Rhodes. Unusually for an all-rounder, for much of his career he was equally successful as a batsman and as a bowler. Consequently, he was a key member of the Yorkshire team. His Yorkshire captain Lord Hawke described Hirst as "the greatest county cricketer of all time", and journalist <a href="Jim%20Kilburn">Jim Kilburn</a> noted that no cricketer could "capture the heart and the imagination and the affections more firmly than George Herbert Hirst." <a href="E.%20W.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a> described his typical style of play as "grafting for victory without heroics". His record as a Test cricketer was less impressive than his figures in county cricket, owing to some extent to playing conditions during his two tours of Australia which reduced the effectiveness of his bowling and batting.

Hirst gave the impression of enjoying every game he played, and many of the captains under whom he played praised both his personality and his contribution to the team. Lord Hawke said that Hirst's smile "went right round his head and met at the back." Warner noted his wit helped the team in difficult situations during the tour of Australia in 1903–04. Hirst's "Times" obituary said: "No why or wherefore, no explanation of his great ability, not even his record which adorns the pages of "Wisden" can adequately describe to those who had not the fortune to see him play the rich quality of George Hirst, the type of professional cricketer to which all would like to aspire. He played during the golden age of cricket, and he was one of the most illustrious of his time." Hirst was noted for his honesty, sportsmanship, and enthusiasm. Known as "George Herbert", he was admired and affectionately regarded by his contemporaries and by spectators. The public worshipped him in a way never replicated for his contemporary and fellow Kirkheaton-born all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes, a much more dour character. The two men were never good friends; there may have been a degree of jealousy between them, and Rhodes did not appreciate Hirst's jovial attitude. Rhodes was more tactically astute than Hirst, but Hirst's enthusiasm and personality were more inspirational to the team. Rhodes, when asked about Hirst's ability to swing the ball, replied: "He was very good. But he didn't know how to use it, you know. I had to set the field for him so that he got the best out of it."

A plain-speaking man, Hirst could be firm and even outspoken at times. "Wisden" said: "Cricket was George Hirst's life". Bowes wrote that Hirst "was loved as a player, he was worshipped as a coach, revered as a man. His friends numbered thousands. He gave his full life to cricket; cricket gave a full life to him." Bowes also commented: "I never hope to meet a better coach or a better man."

On 1 January 1896, Hirst married Emma Kilner in Kirkheaton; James, their first child, was born on 6 October of the same year. A second child, Annie, followed in December 1899, and a third, Molly, in April 1906. The family first lived in Kirkheaton but later moved to <a href="Marsh%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Marsh</a>, a more affluent area of Huddersfield. In his later years, Hirst's health declined and he spent time in a nursing home. His wife died in 1953; twelve months later, on 10 May 1954, Hirst died, aged 82. He was cremated at Lawnswood Crematorium, Leeds.

Harold Davidson

Harold Francis Davidson (14 July 1875 – 30 July 1937), generally known as the Rector of Stiffkey, was a <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> priest who in 1932, after a public scandal, was convicted of immorality by a church court and <a href="defrocked">defrocked</a>. Davidson strongly protested his innocence and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.

Before his ordination in 1903, Davidson had a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young <a href="curate">curate</a> he became actively involved with charitable activity among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> of the rural <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> parish of <a href="Stiffkey">Stiffkey</a>. After the First World War, in which he served as a naval chaplain, he devoted himself primarily to his London work. Styling himself the "Prostitutes' Padre", his declared mission was the rescue of young girls he considered in danger of falling into vice. In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls and, although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his local duties over many years strained relations with his parishioners in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Norwich">Bishop of Norwich</a> instituted disciplinary proceedings through a <a href="consistory%20court">consistory court</a>. Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his eccentric conduct, and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of him with a near-naked teenage girl.

Davidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.

Harold Davidson was born on 14 July 1875 in <a href="Sholing">Sholing</a>, near the south coast port of <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, to the Reverend Francis Davidson and his wife Alice. Francis Davidson was the vicar of St Mary's, Sholing, a post he had held since 1866; as many as 27 members of the Davidson family were or had been <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> clergy. Alice Davidson, née Hodgskin, was a great-niece of the educator and <a href="Rugby%20School">Rugby School</a> headmaster <a href="Thomas%20Arnold">Thomas Arnold</a>. Sholing was a poor parish, with a mixed population of dock labourers and itinerant workers, many of whom had little interest in churchgoing. Francis Davidson, described by Harold Davidson's earliest biographer, Tom Cullen, as "a tiny man ... with a luxuriant beard that gave him the appearance of a gnome", served the parish for 48 years. Although he could be pugnacious when necessary, according to a former parishioner he was a true pastor, willing to offer help whatever the circumstances.

Davidson's family assumed that he would follow his father in becoming a priest and he was brought up strictly. When he was six he began attending Banister Court School in Southampton, an establishment founded initially for the sons of <a href="Merchant%20Navy%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Merchant Navy</a> officers. In 1890 Harold was sent to live with two maiden aunts in <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a> while he attended the <a href="Whitgift%20School">Whitgift School</a>. Here he became an enthusiastic amateur actor, encouraged by his friendship with a fellow-pupil, <a href="Leon%20Quartermaine">Leon Quartermaine</a>, who later won recognition on the stage and in films. In February 1894 the pair appeared together in a school production of the farce "Sent to the Tower". Under his aunts' influence, Davidson became a part-time worker at <a href="Toynbee%20Hall">Toynbee Hall</a>, an East End charity founded by <a href="Samuel%20Barnett%20%28reformer%29">Samuel</a> and <a href="Henrietta%20Barnett">Henrietta Barnett</a> which attracted many volunteers from schools and universities. Because of these distractions he neglected his school work and failed to win a scholarship that would enable him to attend <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> and study for <a href="holy%20orders">holy orders</a>. In the face of his father's disapproval, he decided to pursue a career as a stage comedian.

Davidson's principal theatrical genre was that of the "drawing-room entertainer"; Cullen describes this kind of performance as "An answer to the demand of a rising middle class which was neither cultured nor resourceful, but which wanted desperately to be diverted". Within a few months of leaving Whitgift in 1894, Davidson appeared on the London stage, at <a href="Steinway%20Hall%23London">Steinway Hall</a> in Lower Seymour Street, performing a comic routine. He was reasonably successful and in the next few years found provincial engagements with Masonic lodges, literary societies and similar social organisations. Cullen suggests that his greatest triumph was as a comic actor in a touring production of <a href="Brandon%20Thomas">Brandon Thomas</a>'s popular farce "<a href="Charley%27s%20Aunt">Charley's Aunt</a>". Davidson played the part of Lord Fancourt Babberley, who masquerades as the rich aunt of a fellow-Oxford undergraduate—a frenetic role for which Cullen believes Davidson was eminently suitable.
During his theatrical days, Davidson maintained high standards of personal morality, observed strict <a href="teetotalism">teetotalism</a> and gave regular Bible readings to the elderly in the towns in which he performed on tour. He later gave an account of an incident from November 1894 when he was performing in London. While walking along the <a href="Thames%20Embankment">Thames Embankment</a> in a thick fog, he said, he encountered a 16-year-old girl who was about to throw herself into the <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a>. After preventing her suicide attempt, Davidson learned that she had run away from home near <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, was penniless and without shelter. He paid her fare home: "Her pitiful story made a tremendous impression on me ... I have ever since ... kept my eyes open for opportunities to help that kind of girl."

In 1898 Davidson finally bowed to his father's wish that he should study for holy orders, after the intervention of the Reverend <a href="Basil%20Wilberforce">Basil Wilberforce</a>, grandson of the abolitionist <a href="William%20Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a> and a friend of the Davidson family. Wilberforce was an alumnus of <a href="Exeter%20College%2C%20Oxford">Exeter College, Oxford</a>, and used his influence to secure Davidson a place there despite the latter's lack of qualifications. At Oxford, Davidson's behaviour was notably eccentric; he displayed considerable energy but disregarded rules, was persistently unpunctual and regularly failed his examinations. He continued to appear on the stage when he could, and decorated the walls of his rooms with autographed pictures of actresses. By 1901 his academic inadequacies were such that he was required to leave Exeter College, although he was allowed to continue studying for his degree at Grindle's Hall, a <a href="Cram%20school">cramming establishment</a>. He finally passed his examinations in 1903, at the age of 28, and that year was ordained by the <a href="Francis%20Paget">Bishop of Oxford</a>—after some reluctance on the part of the bishop to accept so unpromising a candidate.

In 1901, when <a href="Annie%20Horniman">Annie Horniman</a>'s travelling theatrical company visited Oxford, Davidson fell in love with one of the company's leading actresses, Moyra ("Molly") Cassandra Saurin, an attractive blonde and blue-eyed woman from <a href="County%20Meath">County Meath</a> in Ireland. The couple were quickly engaged, but the relationship was stormy and was several times broken off. There was no question of marriage until Davidson was fully established in his new profession. His first church appointment was a curacy at Holy Trinity Church, <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor, Berkshire</a>, with an additional role as assistant chaplain to the <a href="Household%20Cavalry">Household Cavalry</a> at <a href="Combermere%20Barracks">Combermere Barracks</a>. In 1905 he was transferred to London as curate at <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a>, where his enthusiasm and industry drew approving comments.

Davidson's appointment in 1906 as rector of the <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> parish of Stiffkey with <a href="Morston">Morston</a> came through the <a href="Patronage%23Ecclesiastical">patronage</a> of <a href="John%20Townshend%2C%206th%20Marquess%20Townshend">the 6th Marquess Townshend</a>, whose family had a long history of public and political service in the county.. The appointment was probably given in recognition of Davidson's role in reconciling the fierce opposition of the Townshend family to the marquess's proposed marriage to Gladys Sutherst, the daughter of a bankrupt Yorkshire businessman; as curate of St Martin's, Davidson had officiated at the wedding on 8 August 1905. The Stiffkey living was highly desirable, with of <a href="Glebe">glebe land</a>, a large <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> rectory, and an income in 1906 of £503 per annum, rising during Davidson's incumbency to £800.

Stiffkey, close to the northern Norfolk coast, lies on both sides of the <a href="River%20Stiffkey">River Stiffkey</a>, with extensive salt marshes on its seaward side. At the time of Davidson's arrival in 1906 the village, with a population of around 350, was generally impoverished although, according to Davidson's 2007 biographer Jonathan Tucker, it was well supplied with shops and public houses. Davidson was quickly on good terms with most of the villagers, who referred to him with affection as "Little Jimmy"—he was only tall. He was less well regarded by the local gentry, including the main landowner, Colonel Groom, who fell out with Davidson after the priest rebuked him for keeping a mistress.

On 9 October 1906, now settled into a prosperous living, Davidson married Molly Saurin. The Stiffkey rectory became a family home, as children were born at regular intervals. Notwithstanding his parochial and domestic responsibilities, Davidson quickly adopted the habit of spending much of the week in London, engaged in various kinds of social work. Through his friendship with <a href="Reginald%20Kennedy-Cox">Reginald Kennedy-Cox</a>, whom he had met at Oxford, Davidson became involved with the Malvern Mission, forerunner of the <a href="Dockland%20Settlements">Dockland Settlements</a>, of which he later became a trustee. He also became chaplain to the Actors' Church Union, based at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden">St Paul's, Covent Garden</a>, and was frequently to be found backstage in London's theatres, ministering to the needs of showgirls—sometimes with an unwelcomed degree of persistence. Between 1910 and 1913 he expanded this work to Paris, to which he made regular visits, sometimes acting as a chaperone for dancers recruited by the <a href="Folies%20Berg%C3%A8re">Folies Bergère</a>. Many out-of-work and would-be actresses were invited to stay at the Stiffkey rectory, sometimes as many as 20 at a time, to the consternation of Molly Davidson and of some of the local establishment who feared for the morals of local farmhands. Among those most disapproving of Davidson's conduct was Major <a href="Philip%20Hamond">Philip Hamond</a>, a churchwarden at Morston, who later became Davidson's principal adversary.

Davidson was 39 years old at the outbreak of war in 1914. In October 1915, possibly to escape the increasingly turbulent atmosphere in the Stiffkey rectory, he joined the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> as a <a href="Military%20chaplain">chaplain</a>. He began his service on <a href="HMS%20Gibraltar%20%281892%29">HMS "Gibraltar"</a>, a depot ship based in the <a href="Shetland%20Islands">Shetland Islands</a>, where he irritated his shipmates by calling church parades every time another ship visited the anchorage; he had the full approval of the base commander, <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Reginald%20Tupper">Sir Reginald Tupper</a>, who was known as "Holy Reggie". Davidson's service report from "Gibraltar"s captain records that "he performs his duties in a perfunctory manner. Not on good terms with messmates, disregards mess rules and regulations". In October 1916 Davidson joined <a href="HMS%20Fox%20%281893%29">HMS "Fox"</a> in the Middle East, and shortly afterwards was arrested by the naval police during a raid on a Cairo brothel. He explained that he was looking for a diseased prostitute who had been infecting his men. Again his commanding officer's reports were negative; however, Davidson remained with the "Fox" until August 1918 when he was posted to <a href="HMS%20Leviathan%20%281901%29">HMS "Leviathan"</a> in the northern Atlantic. Here, his commander was slightly more complimentary; he found Davidson "a clever writer and entertainer [who] pays attention to duty". Davidson left the Navy in March 1919.

When Davidson returned home he found that Molly was six months pregnant. The dates of his service leave during 1918 made it apparent that he was not the father. A daughter was born on 21 June 1919; the likely father was a Canadian army colonel, Ernest Doudemain, a friend from Davidson's schooldays who had lodged at the rectory in the latter part of 1918. Although deeply upset by his wife's infidelity, Davidson accepted the child—who bore some resemblance to him—as his own. To escape the poisoned atmosphere in Stiffkey he applied for a year's posting as chaplain to a hill station at <a href="Shimla">Simla</a> in India, but the opportunity fell through. Instead, Davidson resumed his pre-war routine of spending his weeks in London, departing early on Monday morning and returning late on Saturday. Sometimes, through a missed rail connection or other mishap, he was barely in time for the Sunday morning service at Stiffkey, and sometimes he would fail to arrive at all.

Davidson, perhaps on the basis of his youthful Thames-side rescue, had convinced himself that nearly all young girls alone in London were in need of rescue from a life of vice. Typical of these was Rose Ellis, whom he met in <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester Square</a> in September 1920. Twenty years old and living precariously from part-time prostitution, she was homeless and had no money. Davidson gave her cash for a room, and arranged to meet her the following week. Thus began a friendship that endured for more than a decade. Davidson brought her to the rectory, where she worked for a time in the gardens. He also tried to get her a job with a touring theatre company, took her to Paris to find employment as an <a href="au%20pair">au pair</a>, kept her supplied with small sums of money, and paid her medical bills when she was suffering from <a href="Sexually%20transmitted%20infection">venereal disease</a>.

According to his own estimate, Davidson approached around 150 to 200 girls a year over a period of 12 years (he later modified these figures to an overall total of between 500 and 1000). His activities usually centred on the innumerable <a href="J.%20Lyons%20and%20Co.">Lyons</a>, <a href="Aerated%20Bread%20Company">ABC</a> and <a href="Express%20Dairies">Express Dairies</a> teashops and their staffs of waitresses. Davidson was mesmerised, says Blythe, by "the ineffable harmonies created by starched linen crackling over young breasts and black-stockinged calves in chubby conference just below the hem of the parlourmaid's frock". Many rejected his advances; a number of teashops considered him a pest and barred him. Landladies took exception to his habit of visiting their female tenants at all hours of the night. Commentators have found little evidence that he behaved indecently, or molested the girls; he bought them tea, found them rooms, listened to their problems and sometimes found them work on the stage or in domestic service. He styled himself the "Prostitutes' Padre", and asserted to his bishop that this was "the proudest title that a true priest of Christ can hold".

To meet the costs of his lifestyle, Davidson needed more money than his Stiffkey living could provide. He sought to improve his financial position when, in about 1920, he met Arthur John Gordon, supposedly a wealthy American company promoter but in reality an undischarged bankrupt and confidence trickster. Gordon not only persuaded Davidson to invest his savings in a range of dubious schemes, but also got him to solicit funds from other investors. Davidson borrowed heavily to increase his investment and by 1925 was in serious financial difficulties. In February that year he failed to pay his <a href="Rates%20%28tax%29">local rates</a> and was threatened with imprisonment. He avoided this by borrowing from moneylenders at exorbitant interest <a href="Rates%20%28tax%29">rates</a>, but in October was forced to file a petition of bankruptcy with debts totalling £2,924. Eventually a settlement was reached, whereby around half of his Stiffkey stipend was applied to the reduction of his debts. Somehow, however, Davidson managed to continue his London life. He never stopped believing in Gordon's essential honesty, and was certain that one day his investments would pay off. Much of his time in London was spent, not in pursuit of girls, but looking for Gordon.

Although many of Davidson's parishioners accepted that his London rescue mission was entirely honourable, some, including Major Hamond, were less convinced. Hamond was suspicious of the stream of visitors that Davidson brought to the Stiffkey rectory and thought he was neglecting his parochial duties. In 1927 relations between the two men worsened when Davidson, in a letter which Tucker describes as "breathless in its rudeness and insensitivity", upbraided the major for clearing the ground in the Morston churchyard alongside his recently deceased wife's grave: "Morston Churchyard is the private freehold property of the Rector of Morston ... you have no possible right to interfere with it in any way without my permission any more than I have the right to come and annex a part of your garden." On one occasion, Davidson arrived late at Morston to officiate at a <a href="Eucharist">communion service</a>, having forgotten the bread and wine; enraged, Hamond ordered him back to the rectory to collect it. An even greater lapse, in Hamond's eyes, was Davidson's failure to return to Stiffkey in time to officiate at the 1930 <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a> ceremony at the local war memorial.

Early in 1931, advised by a cousin who was a priest, Hamond made a formal complaint against Davidson to the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Norwich">Bishop of Norwich</a>, the Right Reverend <a href="Bertram%20Pollock">Bertram Pollock</a>, citing the rector's supposed behaviour with women in London. Under the provisions of the Clergy Discipline Act of 1892, members of the clergy could be prosecuted in a <a href="consistory%20court">consistory court</a> for "immoral acts" and, if convicted, face punishments ranging from temporary suspension to full deposition—"<a href="defrocking">defrocking</a>"—from holy orders. Pollock was initially reluctant to prosecute Davidson, but was advised by his legal counsel Henry Dashwood that the case should proceed. In search of evidence, Dashwood hired a private enquiry agent, who soon found Rose Ellis and persuaded her to sign a statement detailing her ten-year association with Davidson. The statement—which was immediately retracted by Ellis and never presented in court—contained little indication of any intimate relationship other than that she had once lanced a boil on Davidson's bottom.

Enquiries continued for many months. The bishop was initially reluctant to pursue the case—Davidson thought he might be prepared to replace the charges with a lesser one of indiscipline. In February 1932 Dashwood advised Pollock that the matter could not be suppressed in this way; allegations had been printed in the "<a href="The%20Evening%20News%20%28London%20newspaper%29">Evening News</a>" on 1 February, and the story had been picked up by other papers whose lurid headlines had created much public interest. On 7 February the bishop received a letter from a 17-year-old girl, Barbara Harris, which contained specific allegations of immoral conduct against Davidson and promised more: "I know lots of things against him that might help you ... He has the keys of a lot of girls' flats and front doors." This letter is described by <a href="Matthew%20Parris">Matthew Parris</a> in his account of the case as "a masterpiece of vituperation"; Davidson's lawyers failed to identify some obvious differences between the handwriting in the letter and other examples of Harris's writing, a factor which might have affected the impact of her subsequent testimony to the court.

A consistory court was convened for 29 March 1932, under the presidency of the Norwich diocesan chancellor, F. Keppel North. Davidson was accused of associating with "women of loose character", and "accosting, molesting, and importuning young females for immoral purposes". The prosecution's case was in the hands of a high-profile legal team, headed by Roland Oliver <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">KC</a> and including the future cabinet minister <a href="Walter%20Monckton">Walter Monckton</a>. Davidson, meanwhile, engaged experienced lawyers to defend him, funding this partly through the sale of newspaper stories. Because of the level of press interest, and the number of London-based witnesses involved, the court sat in <a href="Church%20House%2C%20Westminster">Church House, Westminster</a>, rather than in <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>.

After Oliver provided a summary account of Davidson's life in London, Barbara Harris gave evidence. Cullen likens her evidence to "a whip of scorpions" that Davidson took full in the face. Davidson had first met Harris in September 1930, when she was 16. He had used a favoured ploy—affecting to confuse her with a well-known film actress—to persuade her to take a meal with him. He then began regular visits to her lodgings, gave her small sums of money and promised to find her work. From time to time he shared rooms with her: "At first he kept to the chair", Harris wrote, "but after the first few nights he did not". In her evidence to the court she said she had not had intercourse with Davidson, though he had attempted this on several occasions; when she had repulsed his advances, she claimed that he had "relieved himself".

Other aspects of the odd relationship were revealed during Harris' lengthy examination and cross-examination: her visit to the Stiffkey rectory where she had been made to work as an unpaid kitchenmaid and given only a chair to sleep in; Davidson's repeated promises to divorce his wife and marry Harris; an incident when she and another girl, the latter in a nightgown, had danced in front of Davidson, supposedly so that he could judge their dancing abilities. The picture that Harris' letter and evidence presented, if true, Tucker says, was that of "a man who is out of control ... running around London entertaining teenage girls ... adopting the guise of a kindly priest to ingratiate himself".

Harris was followed into the witness-box by a succession of landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a "partnership in crime". He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a "buttock" was, claiming: "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far as I remember it is a little below the waist." At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson's oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know she was naked under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.

During the court proceedings Davidson continued to officiate at Stiffkey and Morston, although his erratic attendance meant that substitutes often had to be arranged. On 12 June 1932 the Reverend <a href="Richard%20Cattell">Richard Cattell</a> arrived to officiate at the evening service in Stiffkey. He had just begun when Davidson entered the church and attempted to seize the Bible. The two priests wrestled with the book for some seconds before Cattell yielded, telling the congregation: "As nothing short of force will prevent Mr Davidson from taking part, I can see nothing left to do but to withdraw." The crowds of reporters and sightseers at weekends led the <a href="Harry%20Radcliffe">Archdeacon of Lynn</a> to issue a statement deploring the "media circus" and asking that "the full spirit of worship" be restored to Sunday services.
On 8 July 1932 Keppel North announced his verdict; Davidson was guilty on five counts of immorality. The sentence would be determined by the bishop; in the meantime, Davidson was entitled to seek leave to appeal to the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a>. Sorely in need of funds to meet his continuing legal expenses, Davidson reverted to his early career as a stage entertainer. On 18 July he made his debut with a variety act at the Prince's Cinema in <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon</a> and later toured in the provinces until, possibly dissuaded by pressure from church authorities, theatres declined to book him. He then continued his public performances by appearing in a barrel on the <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> sea front, or "<a href="Golden%20Mile%20%28Blackpool%29">Golden Mile</a>", where thousands paid to observe him through a small window. Not everyone was impressed; one customer, recalling the event years later, said: "He was very tatty and the place stank." He shared his seafront billing with, among other attractions, "Mariana the Gorilla Girl", the "Bearded Lady from Russia" and Dick Harrow, "the world's fattest man".

To the consternation of Hamond and some other parishioners, the bishop delayed issuing an instruction forbidding Davidson to preach. When Hamond locked Morston church against him, the rector preached to a large congregation on the grass outside the church. In August, Davidson's licence to minister as a priest was revoked; his last service was morning worship at Stiffkey on 21 August 1932, when around 1,000 people congregated outside the church. That afternoon he demanded the Morston church keys from Hamond, who sent him away by turning him round and administering a substantial kick. Hamond was later fined for this assault.

In July and again in October, Davidson was refused leave to appeal to the Privy Council on grounds of either fact or law. The consistory court reconvened for sentencing in Norwich Cathedral on 21 October. Davidson was allowed briefly to address the court; he admitted that his behaviour had been indiscreet, but regretted none of his actions and proclaimed his innocence "of any of the graver charges that have been made against me". Then, in what Blythe describes as a "horrible little ceremony", Bishop Pollock delivered the most severe sentence available—that of deposition: "Now therefore we, Bertram ... do thereby pronounce decree and declare that the said Reverend Harold Francis Davidson being a priest and deacon ought to be entirely removed, deposed and degraded from the said offices." Davidson was thus defrocked. As the ceremony ended he made a furious impromptu speech, denouncing the sentence and declaring his intention to appeal to the <a href="Cosmo%20Gordon%20Lang">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>.

The consistory court had awarded the prosecution's costs against Davidson, who now faced enormous legal bills and had no regular source of income. His only recourse was to return to Blackpool and resume his career as a showman; this became his milieu for the next four years, interrupted by occasional prosecutions for obstruction and a nine-day spell in prison in 1933, for non-payment of rent owing to one of his former London landladies. He informed the press: "While I am in the barrel I shall be occupied in preparing my case". Although the barrel act remained his staple performance, he introduced variations over the years: freezing in a refrigerated chamber, or being roasted in a glass-fronted oven while a mechanised devil prodded him with a pitchfork. In August 1935 the freezing routine led to Davidson's arrest and prosecution for attempted suicide; he won the case and was awarded £382 damages for false imprisonment. How much money Davidson made from his various acts is uncertain; Tucker believes that the main financial beneficiary was his agent, Luke Gannon.

Molly Davidson had managed to acquire a small house in <a href="South%20Harrow">South Harrow</a>, where Davidson spent his winters. Off-season he worked sporadically, at one time as a door-to-door book salesman and on other as a porter at <a href="St%20Pancras%20railway%20station">St Pancras railway station</a>. He could not avoid press attention; in November 1936 he was arrested and fined for pestering two 16-year-old girls at <a href="London%20Victoria%20station">Victoria station</a>—he had approached them offering auditions for a leading role in a <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> show. That same month he interrupted a <a href="General%20Synod%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">Church Assembly</a> at <a href="Methodist%20Central%20Hall%20Westminster">Central Hall, Westminster</a>, at which the Archbishop of Canterbury was present. Davidson was prevented from addressing the meeting, at which he dropped numerous copies of a mimeographed pamphlet titled "I Accuse", in which he listed his grievances and castigated the Church's hierarchy.

By 1937 interest in Davidson's Blackpool sideshows was waning and, for that summer, he accepted an invitation to join the self-styled "Captain" Fred Rye's animal-themed show in the east coast resort of <a href="Skegness">Skegness</a>. He considered this a step upwards from what he termed "the blatant vulgarities of Blackpool". Davidson's act consisted of a 10-minute address delivered outside a cage containing two lions, after which he would enter the cage and spend a few minutes with the lions. This required courage on Davidson's part, because he was fearful of animals. A 16-year-old tamer, Irene Somner, supervised proceedings. The act was billed as "Daniel in a modern lion's den", and attracted large audiences, including a significant number of clergy.

On 28 July 1937, at the evening performance, Davidson gave his usual speech before entering the cage in which two lions, Freddie and Toto, were sitting quietly. Then, according to Blythe: "in scarcely credible terms, the little clergyman from Norfolk and the lion acted out the classical Christian martyrdom to the full". Eyewitnesses later reported that after Davidson had cracked his whip and shouted, Freddie became agitated and knocked Davidson over, before seizing him by the neck and running with him around the cage. Somner struggled to pacify the snarling Freddie, who eventually dropped the unconscious Davidson, enabling her to drag him to safety; he was badly gashed, and had suffered a broken bone in his neck. An uncorroborated story circulated that while waiting for the ambulance, Davidson asked that the London newspapers be alerted in time for next day's first editions. According to some press reports he sat up in hospital and asked visitors for their impressions of his ordeal in the cage. Most historians of the affair, however, believe that Davidson never recovered consciousness. He died on 30 July, his death possibly hastened by an <a href="insulin">insulin</a> injection administered by a doctor who believed that Davidson was a <a href="diabetic">diabetic</a>. The <a href="coroner">coroner</a>'s verdict was death by misadventure.

Friends and well-wishers covered the expenses of the funeral, which took place on 3 August in Stiffkey churchyard. A large crowd—around 3,000 according to Tucker—was in attendance including, from Davidson's distant past, the Marchioness Townshend. Onlookers unable to get into the churchyard found vantage points on nearby walls, roofs and in trees. When the headstone was put in place it contained a line from <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>: "For on faith in man and genuine love of man all searching after truth must be founded."

In Skegness, Rye saw Davidson's death as a business opportunity; crowds flocked to see "The Actual Lion that Mauled and Caused the Death of the Ex-Rector of Stiffkey". By contrast, Molly Davidson's financial situation was desperate. When her family applied to the church authorities for help, <a href="Cosmo%20Gordon%20Lang">Archbishop Lang</a> acted on her behalf behind the scenes and eventually she received grants from two church charities. She died in a <a href="Dulwich">Dulwich</a> nursing home in 1955. Of the other major participants in the legal case, Pollock remained as Bishop of Norwich until his resignation in 1942, a year before his death. Davidson's girls—Rose Ellis, Barbara Harris, Estelle Douglas and the rest—disappeared from public view after the 1932 trial, although a 1934 letter from Davidson indicates that Harris was then working at the London store <a href="Selfridges">Selfridges</a>, under the name "Babs Simpson". When announcing a 2010 book about the war artist <a href="Leslie%20Cole%20%28artist%29">Leslie Cole</a>, The Fleece Press revealed that Harris had married Cole after changing her name and had thereafter successfully concealed her true identity from all enquirers. Even her husband may not have known of her past.

After Davidson's death and burial, press attention withered as newspapers concentrated on more significant events in the years before the Second World War. In the decades after the war interest in the affair was periodically revived. In 1963 Blythe, deemed by Parris to be the affair's "best historian", published his account. Later in the 1960s, two stage musical versions were produced: "The Stiffkey Scandals of 1932", which appeared in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> in 1967 and London in 1968, and "God Made the Little Red Apple", staged in Manchester in 1969. Neither of these productions was commercially successful; when the former was adapted for television, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>"s critic questioned the artistic justification for a musical about "so sad and peculiar a person". In the 1970s Davidson's case was the subject of a radio documentary, "A Proper Little Gent", and in 1994 an episode of BBC Television's "Matter of Fact" series examined the affair. Cullen's full-length biography of Davidson in 1975 posits a theory that multiple personalities led him to behave in different ways in differing circumstances. Robert Brown, in a biographical sketch for the "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography%23Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>", suggests that what really motivated Davidson will never be known. In 2007 John Walsh published a fictionalised account of Davidson's life, "Sunday at the Cross Bones" (Fourth Estate), in which, according to a review in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", Davidson is depicted as "well-meaning but ineffectual, bewildered by the world's wickedness and his own barely acknowledged desires".

The question of Davidson's treatment by the consistory court was first raised by the "<a href="Church%20Times">Church Times</a>" immediately after the trial. A leading article argued that, although Davidson's conduct had been "foolish and eccentric", his intentions at least at the start of his ministry had been guided by idealism. Chancellor North was criticised both for lacking compassion and for the general conduct of the proceedings: "No experienced criminal solicitor could conceivably have blundered so badly and consistently." In 2006 Davidson's granddaughter, Karylin Collier, privately published a brief biography, "The Rector of Stiffkey: His Life and Trial", in which she maintains the innocence of all the charges against him. Tucker argues that "Harold Davidson probably deserved to be quietly defrocked for his shortcomings as a priest", but nevertheless believes that he was not an immoral man. He also highlights the incompetent presentation of Davidson's case by his legal team, particularly their failure to question the provenance of the Barbara Harris letter. Tucker concludes that since the proceedings were flawed and the evidence of immorality flimsy, the Church of England owes it to the Davidson family to re-examine the original findings.

The writer-historian <a href="A.%20N.%20Wilson">A. N. Wilson</a> summarises Davidson as a "Tragic buffoon cum Christian Martyr". In his history of Britain in the inter-war years, <a href="A.%20J.%20P.%20Taylor">A. J. P. Taylor</a> writes that "Davidson offered a parable of the age. He attracted more attention than, say, <a href="Cosmo%20Gordon%20Lang">Cosmo Gordon Lang</a>, archbishop of Canterbury. Which man deserves a greater place in the history books?"

"North by North Quahog" is the first episode of the <a href="Family%20Guy%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a> of "<a href="Family%20Guy">Family Guy</a>", following the <a href="revival%20%28television%29">revival</a> of the series three years after its cancellation in 2002. It originally aired on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox network</a> in the United States on May 1, 2005, though it had premiered three days earlier at a special screening at the <a href="University%20of%20Vermont">University of Vermont</a>, <a href="Burlington%2C%20Vermont">Burlington</a>. In the episode, <a href="Peter%20Griffin">Peter</a> and <a href="Lois%20Griffin">Lois</a> go on a second honeymoon to spice up their marriage, but are chased by <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a> after Peter steals the sequel to "<a href="The%20Passion%20of%20the%20Christ">The Passion of the Christ</a>" from Gibson's private hotel room. Meanwhile, <a href="Brian%20Griffin">Brian</a> and <a href="Stewie%20Griffin">Stewie</a> take care of <a href="Chris%20Griffin">Chris</a> and <a href="Meg%20Griffin">Meg</a> at home.

"Family Guy" had been canceled in 2002 due to low ratings, but was revived by Fox after reruns on <a href="Adult%20Swim">Adult Swim</a> became the cable network's most watched program, and more than three million DVDs of the show were sold. Written by series creator <a href="Seth%20MacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a> and directed by <a href="Peter%20Shin">Peter Shin</a>, much of the plot and many of the technical aspects of the episode, as well as the title, are direct parodies of the <a href="1959%20in%20film">1959</a> <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> movie "<a href="North%20by%20Northwest">North by Northwest</a>"; in addition, the episode makes use of <a href="Bernard%20Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a>'s theme music from that film. The episode contains many cultural references; in the opening sequence Peter lists 29 shows that were canceled by Fox after "Family Guy" was canceled and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might have a chance at returning.

Critical responses to "North by North Quahog" were mostly positive, with the opening sequence being praised in particular. The episode was watched by nearly 12 million viewers and received a <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> nomination for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Animated%20Program%20%28for%20Programming%20Less%20Than%20One%20Hour%29">Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)</a>. Shin won an <a href="Annie%20Award">Annie Award</a> for Directing in an Animated Television Production for this episode.

In the cold open, Peter tells his family that they have "been canceled". He then lists all 29 shows, like "<a href="Titus%20%28TV%20series%29">Titus</a>" and "<a href="Andy%20Richter%20Controls%20the%20Universe">Andy Richter Controls the Universe</a>", that were canceled by Fox between the show's cancellation and revival and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might have a chance at returning.

As Peter and Lois are having sex, she yells out <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>'s name, so Peter realizes that she is imagining him as Clooney to maintain her <a href="libido">libido</a>. Lois and Peter decide to take a second <a href="honeymoon">honeymoon</a> to enliven their marriage, and leave their anthropomorphic dog Brian to take care of their children Stewie, Chris, and Meg. Brian is unable to control the children, but Stewie offers to help (in exchange for Brian changing his diaper) and together they manage the home. The pair chaperone a dance at Chris's school, during which the school principal catches Chris in the boys' restroom with <a href="vodka">vodka</a> that belongs to his classmate <a href="Jake%20Tucker">Jake Tucker</a>. Although Brian and Stewie punish Chris by grounding him, they try to clear his name. Jake's father <a href="List%20of%20Family%20Guy%20characters%23Tom%20Tucker">Tom</a> refuses to believe Brian and Stewie, so they resort to planting <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> in Jake's locker, and Jake is sentenced to <a href="community%20service">community service</a>.

On the way to their vacation spot, Lois falls asleep. Unfortunately, Peter doesn't pay attention to the road, deciding instead to read a <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> while driving, and crashes the car into a tree. They are forced to spend their entire honeymoon money on car repairs and are about to return home when Peter discovers that <a href="actor">actor</a>/<a href="film%20director">director</a> <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a> has a private suite at a luxurious hotel nearby, "which he barely uses". He and Lois then go to the hotel, where Peter poses as Gibson to gain access to his room. When Lois yells out Gibson's name during intercourse, Peter, again, decides to return home. As the two are about to leave, Peter accidentally stumbles upon Gibson's private screening room and discovers a sequel to "<a href="The%20Passion%20of%20the%20Christ">The Passion of the Christ</a>" entitled "The Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This". To spare the world from "... another two hours of Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo-jumbo," Peter steals the film. However, when they leave the hotel, they are noticed by two priests, Gibson's associates, who were there to collect the film.

Pursued by the priests in a car chase that leads them through a shopping mall, Lois and Peter escape from the priests and drive to a cornfield where Peter buries the film. While he is doing so, the priests fly down in a <a href="aerial%20application">crop-duster</a> and <a href="kidnapping">kidnap</a> Lois. Peter is then given a message telling him that if he does not return the film to Gibson at his estate on top of <a href="Mount%20Rushmore">Mount Rushmore</a>, his wife will be killed. Peter arrives at the house and gives Gibson a film can. As Peter and Lois are about to leave, Gibson discovers that the film has been replaced with dog feces, leading to a chase on the face of the mountain. While being chased, Lois slips but hangs on to <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>'s lips. Peter grabs her and, while being held at gunpoint, he tells Gibson that the film "is in President Rushmore's mouth" and points to the other side of the monument. Gibson follows Peter's direction and falls off the edge as Peter pulls Lois to safety. Upon climbing back to the top of the mountain, the two have sexual intercourse there, improving their marriage.

In 2002, "Family Guy" was canceled after three seasons due to low <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">ratings</a>. The show was first canceled after the 1999–2000 season, but following a last-minute reprieve, it returned for a third season in 2001. Fox tried to sell rights for reruns of the show, but it was hard to find networks that were interested; <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a> eventually bought the rights, " basically for free", according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television Production. When the reruns were shown on Cartoon Network's <a href="Adult%20Swim">Adult Swim</a> in 2003, "Family Guy" became Adult Swim's most-watched show with an average 1.9 million viewers an episode. Following "Family Guy"s high ratings on Adult Swim, the first season was released on DVD in April 2003. Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies, becoming the best-selling television DVD of 2003 and the second highest-selling television DVD ever, behind the first season of <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a>'s "<a href="Chappelle%27s%20Show">Chappelle's Show</a>". The second season DVD release also sold more than a million copies. The show's popularity in both DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox's interest in it. They ordered 35 new episodes in 2004, marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales. Fox president <a href="Gail%20Berman">Gail Berman</a> said that it was one of her most difficult decisions to cancel the show, and was therefore happy it would return. The network also began production of a film based on the series.
"North by North Quahog" was the first episode to be broadcast after the show's cancellation. It was written by MacFarlane and directed by <a href="Peter%20Shin">Peter Shin</a>, both of whom also wrote and directed <a href="Death%20Has%20a%20Shadow">the pilot</a>. MacFarlane believed the show's three-year hiatus was beneficial because animated shows do not normally have hiatuses, and towards the end of their seasons "... you see a lot more sex jokes and (bodily function) jokes and signs of a fatigued staff that their brains are just fried". With "North by North Quahog", the writing staff tried to keep the show "... exactly as it was" before its cancellation, and did not "... have the desire to make it any <a href="wiktionary%3Aslick">slicker</a>" than it already was. <a href="Walter%20Murphy">Walter Murphy</a>, who had composed music for the show before its cancellation, returned to compose the music for "North by North Quahog". Murphy and the orchestra recorded an arrangement of <a href="Bernard%20Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a>'s <a href="film%20score">score</a> from "<a href="North%20by%20Northwest">North by Northwest</a>", a film referenced multiple times in the episode.

Fox had ordered five episode scripts at the end of the third season; these episodes had been written but not produced. One of these scripts was adapted into "North by North Quahog". The original script featured "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" character <a href="Boba%20Fett">Boba Fett</a>, and later actor, writer and producer <a href="Aaron%20Spelling">Aaron Spelling</a>, but the release of the iconic film "<a href="The%20Passion%20of%20the%20Christ">The Passion of the Christ</a>" inspired the writers to incorporate Mel Gibson into the episode. Multiple endings were written, including one in which <a href="List%20of%20characters%20in%20Family%20Guy%23Jesus%2C%20God%20and%20Death">Death</a> comes for Gibson. During production, an episode of "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>" was released entitled "<a href="The%20Passion%20of%20the%20Jew">The Passion of the Jew</a>" that also featured Gibson as a prominent character. This gave the "Family Guy" writers pause, fearing accusations " that we had ripped them off."

Three days before the episode debuted on television, it was screened at the <a href="University%20of%20Vermont">University of Vermont</a> (UVM) in <a href="Burlington%2C%20Vermont">Burlington</a>, accompanied by an hour-long question-and-answer session with MacFarlane. The UVM's special screening of the episode was attended by 1,700 people. As promotion for the show, and to, as Newman described, "expand interest in the show beyond its die hard fans", Fox organized four "Family Guy Live!" performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud; "North by North Quahog" was also previewed. In addition, the cast performed musical numbers from the "<a href="Family%20Guy%20Live%20in%20Vegas">Family Guy Live in Vegas</a>" comedy album. The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 <a href="Montreal%20Comedy%20Festival">Montreal Comedy Festival</a>. The "Family Guy Live!" performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each.

The episode opens with Peter telling the rest of the family that "Family Guy" has been canceled. He lists the following 29 shows (in chronological order), that he says Fox has to make room for: "<a href="Dark%20Angel%20%282000%20TV%20series%29">Dark Angel</a>", "<a href="Titus%20%28TV%20series%29">Titus</a>" (though "Titus" was facing cancellation the same year "Family Guy" was), "<a href="Undeclared">Undeclared</a>", "<a href="Action%20%28TV%20series%29">Action</a>", "<a href="That%20%2780s%20Show">That '80s Show</a>", "<a href="Wonderfalls">Wonderfalls</a>", "<a href="Fastlane%20%28TV%20series%29">Fastlane</a>", "<a href="Andy%20Richter%20Controls%20the%20Universe">Andy Richter Controls the Universe</a>", "<a href="Skin%20%28TV%20series%29">Skin</a>", "<a href="Girls%20Club%20%28TV%20series%29">Girls Club</a>", "<a href="Cracking%20Up%20%28TV%20series%29">Cracking Up</a>", "<a href="The%20Pitts">The Pitts</a>", "<a href="Firefly%20%28TV%20series%29">Firefly</a>", "<a href="Get%20Real%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Get Real</a>", "<a href="FreakyLinks">FreakyLinks</a>", "<a href="Wanda%20at%20Large">Wanda at Large</a>", "<a href="Costello%20%28TV%20series%29">Costello</a>", "<a href="The%20Lone%20Gunmen%20%28TV%20series%29">The Lone Gunmen</a>", "<a href="A%20Minute%20with%20Stan%20Hooper">A Minute with Stan Hooper</a>", "<a href="Normal%2C%20Ohio">Normal, Ohio</a>", "<a href="Pasadena%20%28TV%20series%29">Pasadena</a>", "<a href="Harsh%20Realm">Harsh Realm</a>", "<a href="Keen%20Eddie">Keen Eddie</a>", "<a href="The%20Street%20%282000%20TV%20series%29">The $treet</a>", "<a href="The%20American%20Embassy">The American Embassy</a>", "<a href="Cedric%20the%20Entertainer%20Presents">Cedric the Entertainer Presents</a>", "<a href="The%20Tick%20%282001%20TV%20series%29">The Tick</a>", "<a href="Luis%20%28TV%20series%29">Luis</a>", and "<a href="Greg%20the%20Bunny">Greg the Bunny</a>". Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance, the joke being all these shows had indeed already been canceled by Fox. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that, during the first "Family Guy Live!" performance, "... the longer [the list] went, the louder the laughs from the Town Hall crowd [became]".

Australian-American actor Mel Gibson is prominently featured in the episode; his voice was impersonated by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Sogliuzzo">André Sogliuzzo</a>. Gibson directed the film "<a href="The%20Passion%20of%20the%20Christ">The Passion of the Christ</a>" (2004) and, in the episode, is seen making a sequel entitled "Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This". The fictional sequel is a combination of "The Passion of the Christ" and "<a href="Rush%20Hour%20%281998%20film%29">Rush Hour</a>" (1998), and stars <a href="Chris%20Tucker">Chris Tucker</a>, who starred in "Rush Hour", and <a href="Jim%20Caviezel">Jim Caviezel</a> who portrayed <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> in "The Passion of the Christ".

Besides the title, the episode contains several references to <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s 1959 film "<a href="North%20by%20Northwest">North by Northwest</a>", including the scene where Lois is kidnapped by Gibson's associates, the two priests flying a crop-duster who chase Peter through a cornfield, and the final face-off between Peter, Lois and Gibson that takes place on Mount Rushmore.

As Peter and Lois are driving to <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a> for their second honeymoon, Peter is reading a <a href="Archie%20Comics">Jughead comic book</a> and their car crashes. The fictional Park Barrington Hotel, where Peter and Lois steal Gibson's film, is located in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. The car chase scene through a shopping mall is a recreation of a scene from the 1980 comedy film "<a href="The%20Blues%20Brothers%20%28film%29">The Blues Brothers</a>". To stop Meg and Chris from fighting, Brian reads to them from one of the few books Peter owns, a novelization of the 1980 film "<a href="Caddyshack">Caddyshack</a>" and quotes a line by <a href="Chevy%20Chase">Chevy Chase</a>'s character, Ty Webb.

The episode contains a number of other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their <a href="motel">motel</a> room and find a <a href="prostitution">hooker</a> on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay perfectly still, as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">Jurassic Park</a>" (1993) in which <a href="List%20of%20Jurassic%20Park%20characters%23Dr.%20Alan%20Grant">Dr. Grant</a> gives this warning in reference to a "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus Rex</a>". <a href="Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a> appears in a <a href="cutaway%20%28filmmaking%29">cutaway gag</a>, in which <a href="Mister%20Geppetto">Gepetto</a> bends over and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to tell a lie in an attempt to emulate <a href="anal%20sex">anal sex</a>. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's mother had told her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>'s name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom "<a href="The%20Honeymooners">The Honeymooners</a>" is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which <a href="The%20Honeymooners%23Ralph%20Kramden">Ralph Kramden</a>, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten to do on the show. Meg watches an episode of the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> sitcom "<a href="Two%20and%20a%20Half%20Men">Two and a Half Men</a>", which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier <a href="Flint%20%28G.I.%20Joe%29">Flint</a> of appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates the children on drinking and informs them that "... knowing is half the battle". Flint's voice was provided by <a href="Bill%20Ratner">Bill Ratner</a>, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to <a href="Seth%20Green">Seth Green</a>, who voices Chris, the reason the "Family Guy" cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because if you have the original actor providing the voice " you take it with a little bit more gravitas".

"North by North Quahog" was broadcast on May 1, 2005 as part of an animated television night on Fox, was preceded by two episodes of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" (including the show's <a href="Future-Drama">350th episode</a>), and was followed by the premiere of MacFarlane's new show, "<a href="American%20Dad%21">American Dad!</a>". It was watched by 11.85 million viewers, higher than both "The Simpsons" and "American Dad". The episode's ratings were "Family Guy"s highest ratings since the airing of the season one episode "". "Family Guy" was the week's highest-rated show among teens and men in the 18 to 34 demographic, and more than doubled Fox's average in its timeslot. The episode's first broadcast in Canada on <a href="Global%20Television%20Network">Global</a> was watched by 1.27 million viewers, making it fourth for the week it was broadcast, behind "", "" and "<a href="Canadian%20Idol">Canadian Idol</a>".

The reactions of television critics to "North by North Quahog" were mostly positive. In a simultaneous review of the two episodes of "The Simpsons" that preceded this episode and the "American Dad!" pilot, Chase Squires of the "<a href="St.%20Petersburg%20Times">St. Petersburg Times</a>" stated that "North by North Quahog" "... score[d] the highest". Multimedia news and reviews website <a href="IGN">IGN</a> was pleased to see Stewie and Brian get more screen time as a duo, something they thought had always been one of the show's biggest strengths. IGN placed Peter's idea to pose as Mel Gibson and steal "Passion of the Christ 2" in 9th place on their list of "Peter Griffin's Top 10 Craziest Ideas". Matthew Gilbert of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" commented that the episode's material "would wear thin after a while if the character's weren't as distinct and endearing as they are, most notably Stewie, the wrathful infant."

Critics reacted positively to the opening sequence; in his review of the episode, Mark McGuire of "<a href="Times%20Union%20%28Albany%29">The Times Union</a>" wrote: "... the first minute or so of the resurrected "Family Guy" ranks among the funniest 60 seconds I've seen so far this season." "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" critic Brian Lowry considered the opening sequence to be the best part of the episode. M. Keith Booker, author of the book "Drawn to Television: Primetime Television from The Flintstones to Family Guy", called the opening sequence an "... in-your-face, I-told-you-so rejoinder to the Fox brass  followed by one of the most outrageous "Family Guy" episodes ever".

However, the episode also garnered negative responses. Melanie McFarland of the "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>" stated that "Three years off the air has not made the 'Family Guy' team that much more creative". Kevin Wong of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> thought the episode made fun of easy targets such as Gibson and "The Passion of The Christ", although he felt "Family Guy" regained "... its admirable mix of niche nostalgia and hysterical characterizations" after the first two episodes of the new season. Though Alex Strachan, critic for "<a href="The%20Montreal%20Gazette">The Montreal Gazette</a>", praised the opening sequence, he felt "it's all downhill from there". Bill Brioux of the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" considered the show to be similar to "The Simpsons". Media watchdog group the <a href="Parents%20Television%20Council">Parents Television Council</a>, a <a href="Criticism%20of%20Family%20Guy">frequent critic</a> of the show, branded the episode the "worst show of the week".

"North by North Quahog" was nominated for a <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Animated%20Program%20%28for%20Programming%20Less%20Than%20One%20Hour%29">Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)</a>, the eventual recipient of the award being "South Park" episode "<a href="Best%20Friends%20Forever%20%28South%20Park%29">Best Friends Forever</a>". Peter Shin, director of the episode, won the <a href="Annie%20Award">Annie Award</a> for Best Directing in an Animated Television Production. Fellow "Family Guy" director <a href="Dan%20Povenmire">Dan Povenmire</a>, was nominated for the same award for directing "<a href="PTV%20%28Family%20Guy%29">PTV</a>".

Operation Ke

The Japanese decided to withdraw and concede Guadalcanal to <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> forces for several reasons. All attempts by the IJA to recapture <a href="Henderson%20Field%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Henderson Field</a>, the airfield on Guadalcanal in use by Allied aircraft, had been repulsed with heavy losses. Japanese ground forces on the island had been reduced from 36,000 to 11,000 through starvation, disease, and battle casualties. IJN forces were also suffering heavy losses attempting to reinforce and resupply the ground forces on the island. These losses, plus the projected resources needed for further attempts to recapture Guadalcanal, were affecting strategic security and operations in other areas of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese Empire</a>. The decision to withdraw was endorsed by <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor</a> <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a> on 31 December 1942.

The operation began on 14 January 1943 with the delivery of a battalion of infantry troops to Guadalcanal to act as <a href="rearguard">rearguard</a> for the evacuation. Around the same time, IJA and IJN air forces began an <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> campaign around the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. During the air campaign, a US <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> was sunk in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rennell%20Island">Battle of Rennell Island</a>. Two days later, Japanese aircraft sank a US <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> near Guadalcanal. The withdrawal was carried out on the nights of 1, 4, and 7 February by destroyers.

At a cost of one destroyer sunk and three damaged, the Japanese evacuated 10,652 men from Guadalcanal. During the evacuation 600 died and 3,000 more required extensive hospital care. On 9 February, Allied forces realized that the Japanese were gone and declared Guadalcanal secure, ending the six-month campaign for control of the island.

On 7 August 1942, the US <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division">1st Marine Division</a> landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida%20Islands">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the US and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of capturing or neutralizing the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.

Taking the Japanese by surprise, by nightfall on 8 August the Marines <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">secured Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal. The Allies later renamed it "Henderson Field". Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the "<a href="Cactus%20Air%20Force">Cactus Air Force</a>" (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal.

In response to the landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters (IGH) assigned the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a>'s (IJA) <a href="Seventeenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">17th Army</a>, a <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized command headquartered at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> under the command of Lieutenant General <a href="Harukichi%20Hyakutake">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>, the task of retaking Guadalcanal. Because of the threat by CAF aircraft, the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) was unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, warships based at Rabaul and the <a href="Shortland%20Islands">Shortland Islands</a> were used to carry forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships, mainly light <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s from the <a href="IJN%208th%20Fleet">Eighth Fleet</a> under the command of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Gunichi%20Mikawa">Gunichi Mikawa</a>, were usually able to make the round trip down "<a href="The%20Slot">The Slot</a>" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the "<a href="Tokyo%20Express">Tokyo Express</a>" by Allied forces and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese.
Using forces delivered to Guadalcanal in this manner, the IJA tried three times to retake Henderson Field, but was defeated each time. After the third failure, an attempt by the IJN to deliver the rest of the IJA <a href="38th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">38th Infantry Division</a> and its heavy equipment failed during the <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a> from 12–15 November. Because of this failure, the Japanese cancelled their next planned attempt to recapture Henderson Field.

In mid-November, Allied forces attacked the Japanese at <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna-Gona">Buna-Gona</a> in New Guinea. Japanese <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a> naval leaders, headquartered at <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> and under the overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances in New Guinea posed a greater threat to the security of the Japanese Empire than an Allied military presence in the southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations around New Guinea. At this time, the navy did not inform the army of their intentions in this regard.

As December began, the Japanese experienced considerable difficulty in keeping their troops on Guadalcanal resupplied because of Allied air and naval attacks on the Japanese supply chain of ships and bases. The few supplies delivered to the island were not enough to sustain Japanese troops who, by 7 December, were losing about 50 men each day to malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. The Japanese had delivered almost 30,000 army troops to Guadalcanal since the campaign began, but by December only about 20,000 of that number were still alive; of those, only around 12,000 remained more or less fit for combat duty, with the rest incapacitated by battle wounds, disease, or malnutrition.

The IJN continued to suffer losses and damage to its ships in attempting to keep the Japanese on Guadalcanal resupplied. One destroyer was sunk by American warships at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tassafaronga">Battle of Tassafaronga</a> on 30 November. Another destroyer plus a submarine were sunk and two destroyers damaged by American <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a> and CAF air attacks during subsequent resupply missions from 3–12 December. Compounding the navy's frustration, very few of the supplies carried on these missions reached IJA forces on the island. Combined Fleet leaders began telling their army counterparts the losses and damage to warships engaged in the resupply effort threatened future strategic plans for protecting the Japanese Empire.

Throughout November, Japan's top military leaders at the IGH in Tokyo continued to openly support further efforts to retake Guadalcanal from Allied forces. At the same time, lower-ranking staff officers began to discreetly discuss abandoning the island. <a href="Takushiro%20Hattori">Takushiro Hattori</a> and <a href="Masanobu%20Tsuji">Masanobu Tsuji</a>, each of whom had recently visited Guadalcanal, told their colleagues on the staff that any further attempt to retake the island was a lost cause. <a href="Ry%C5%ABz%C5%8D%20Sejima">Ryūzō Sejima</a> reported that the attrition of IJA troop-strength on Guadalcanal was so unexpectedly severe that future operations would be untenable. On 11 December two staff officers, IJN Commander Yuji Yamamoto and IJA Major Takahiko Hayashi, returned to Tokyo from Rabaul and confirmed Hattori's, Tsuji's, and Sejima's reports. They further reported that most of the IJN and IJA officers at Rabaul appeared to support abandoning Guadalcanal. Around this time, Japan's <a href="Ministry%20of%20War%20of%20Japan">War Ministry</a> informed the IGH that there was insufficient shipping to support both the effort to retake Guadalcanal and transport strategic resources to maintain Japan's economy and military forces.

On 19 December, a delegation of IGH staff officers led by IJA Colonel <a href="Joichiro%20Sanada">Joichiro Sanada</a>, chief of the IGH's operations section, arrived at Rabaul for discussions about future plans concerning New Guinea and Guadalcanal. <a href="Hitoshi%20Imamura">Hitoshi Imamura</a>, commander of the 8th Area Army in charge of IJA operations in New Guinea and the Solomons, did not directly recommend a withdrawal from Guadalcanal but openly and clearly described the current difficulties involved with any further attempts to retake the island. Imamura also stated that any decision to withdraw should include plans to evacuate as many of the soldiers from Guadalcanal as possible.

Sanada returned to Tokyo on 25 December and recommended to the IGH that Guadalcanal be abandoned immediately and all priority given to the campaign in New Guinea. The IGH's top leaders agreed with Sanada's recommendation on 26 December and ordered their staffs to begin drafting plans for the withdrawal from Guadalcanal and establishment of a new defense line in the central Solomons.

On 28 December, General <a href="Hajime%20Sugiyama">Hajime Sugiyama</a> and Admiral <a href="Osami%20Nagano">Osami Nagano</a> personally informed <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor</a> <a href="Hirohito">Hirohito</a> of the decision to withdraw from Guadalcanal. On 31 December, the Emperor formally endorsed the decision.

On 3 January, IGH informed the 8th Area Army and the Combined Fleet of the decision to withdraw from Guadalcanal. By 9 January, the Combined Fleet and 8th Area Army staffs together completed the plan, officially called Operation "<a href="Ke%20%28kana%29">Ke</a>" after a <a href="Mora%20%28linguistics%29">mora</a> in <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a> <a href="Kana">Kana</a> vocabulary, to execute the evacuation.

The plan called for a battalion of IJA infantry to land by destroyer on Guadalcanal around 14 January to act as a rear guard during the evacuation. The 17th Army was to begin withdrawing to the western end of the island about 25 or 26 January. An <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> campaign around the southern Solomons would begin on 28 January. The 17th Army would be picked up in three lifts by destroyers the first week of February with a target completion date of 10 February. At the same time, Japanese air and naval forces would conduct conspicuous maneuvers and minor attacks around New Guinea and the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a> along with deceptive radio traffic to try to confuse the Allies as to their intentions.
Yamamoto detailed <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s and , battleships and – with four heavy cruisers and a destroyer as the screening force – under <a href="Nobutake%20Kond%C5%8D">Nobutake Kondō</a> to provide distant cover for "Ke" around <a href="Ontong%20Java">Ontong Java</a> in the northern Solomons. The evacuation runs were to be carried out by Mikawa's 8th Fleet, consisting of heavy cruisers and , light cruiser , and 21 destroyers. Mikawa's destroyers were charged with conducting the evacuation. Yamamoto expected that at least half of Mikawa's destroyers would be sunk during the operation.

Supporting the air superiority portion of the operation were the IJN's 11th Air Fleet and the IJA's 6th Air Division, based at Rabaul with 212 and 100 aircraft, respectively. 64 aircraft from carrier s air group were also temporarily assigned to Rabaul. An additional 60 floatplanes from the IJN's "R" Area Air Force, based at Rabaul, <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a> and the <a href="Shortland%20Islands">Shortland Islands</a>, brought the total number of Japanese aircraft involved in the operation to 436. The combined Japanese warship and naval air units in the area formed the <a href="Southeast%20Area%20Fleet">Southeast Area Fleet</a>, commanded by <a href="Jinichi%20Kusaka">Jinichi Kusaka</a> at Rabaul.

Opposing the Japanese and under the command of <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="William%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William Halsey, Jr.</a>, commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific, were fleet carriers and , six <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a>s, three fast battleships, four old battleships, 13 cruisers, and 45 destroyers. In the air, the <a href="Thirteenth%20Air%20Force">13th Air Force</a> numbered 92 fighters and bombers under <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Nathan%20Farragut%20Twining">Nathan F. Twining</a> and the CAF on Guadalcanal counted 81 aircraft under US Marine Brigadier General <a href="Francis%20P.%20Mulcahy">Francis P. Mulcahy</a>. <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Aubrey%20Fitch">Aubrey Fitch</a> was overall commander of Aircraft South Pacific. The air units of the fleet and escort carriers added another 339 aircraft. In addition, 30 heavy bombers were stationed in New Guinea with sufficient range to conduct missions over the Solomon Islands. In total, the Allies possessed around 539 aircraft available to oppose the "Ke" operation.

By the first week of January, disease, starvation, and battle had reduced Hyakutake's command to about 14,000 troops, with many of them too sick and malnourished to fight. The 17th Army possessed three operable <a href="artillery">field cannon</a>, with very little ammunition. In contrast, the Allied commander on the island, US Army Major General <a href="Alexander%20Patch">Alexander Patch</a>, fielded a combined force of US Army and US Marines, designated the <a href="XIV%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">XIV Corps</a>, totaling 50,666 men. At Patch's disposal were 167 artillery weapons, including <a href="M116%20howitzer"></a>, <a href="M101%20howitzer"></a>, and <a href="M114%20155%20mm%20howitzer"></a> <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s, and plentiful stocks of shells.

On 1 January, the Japanese military changed their radio communication codes, making it more difficult for Allied <a href="Military%20intelligence">intelligence</a>, which had previously partially broken Japanese radio ciphers, to divine Japanese intentions and movement. As January progressed, Allied <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> and radio traffic analysis noted the buildup of ships and aircraft at Truk, Rabaul, and the Shortland Islands. Allied analysts determined that the increased radio traffic in the Marshalls was a deception meant to divert attention from an operation about to take place in either New Guinea or the Solomons. Allied intelligence personnel misinterpreted the nature of the operation; on 26 January, the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Command">Allied Pacific Command</a>'s intelligence section informed Allied forces in the Pacific that the Japanese were preparing for a new offensive, called "Ke", in either the Solomons or New Guinea.

On 14 January, an Express mission of nine destroyers delivered the Yano Battalion, designated as the rear guard for the "Ke" evacuation, to Guadalcanal. The battalion, commanded by Major Keiji Yano, consisted of 750 infantry and a battery of <a href="mountain%20gun">mountain gun</a>s crewed by another 100 men. Accompanying the battalion was Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Kumao%20Imoto">Kumao Imoto</a>, representing the 8th Area Army, who was to deliver the evacuation order and plan to Hyakutake. The 17th Army had not yet been informed of the decision to withdraw. CAF and 13th Air Force air attacks on the nine destroyers during their return trip damaged destroyers and and destroyed eight Japanese fighters escorting the convoy. Five American aircraft were shot down.

Late on 15 January, Imoto reached 17th Army's headquarters at Kokumbona and informed Hyakutake and his staff of the decision to withdraw from the island. Grudgingly accepting the order on the 16th, the 17th Army staff communicated the "Ke" evacuation plan to their forces on the 18th. The plan directed the 38th Division, which was currently defending against an American <a href="Battle%20of%20Mount%20Austen%2C%20the%20Galloping%20Horse%2C%20and%20the%20Sea%20Horse">offensive</a> on ridges and hills in the interior of the island, to disengage and withdraw towards Cape Esperance on the western end of Guadalcanal beginning on the 20th. The 38th's retirement would be covered by the <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">2nd Infantry Division</a>, in place on Guadalcanal since October 1942, and the Yano Battalion, both of which would then follow the 38th westward. Any troops unable to move were encouraged to kill themselves to "uphold the honor of the Imperial Army".

Patch initiated a new offensive just as the 38th Division began to withdraw from the inland ridges and hills that it had occupied. On 20 January, the <a href="25th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">25th Infantry Division</a>, under Major General <a href="J.%20Lawton%20Collins">J. Lawton Collins</a>, attacked several hills, designated Hills 87, 88, and 89 by the Americans, that formed a ridge that dominated Kokumbona. Encountering much lighter resistance than anticipated, the Americans seized the three hills by the morning of 22 January. Shifting forces to exploit the unexpected breakthrough, Collins quickly continued the advance and captured the next two hills, 90 and 91, by nightfall, placing the Americans in position to isolate and capture Kokumbona and trap the Japanese 2nd Division.
Reacting quickly to the situation, the Japanese hurriedly evacuated Kokumbona and ordered the 2nd Division to retire westward immediately. The Americans captured Kokumbona on 23 January. Although some Japanese units were trapped between the American forces and destroyed, most of the 2nd Division's survivors escaped.

Still fearing a renewed and reinforced Japanese offensive, Patch committed the equivalent of only one regiment at a time to attack the Japanese forces west of Kokumbona, keeping the rest near Lunga Point to protect the airfield. The terrain west of Kokumbona favored the Japanese efforts to delay the Americans as the rest of the 17th Army continued its withdrawal towards Cape Esperance. The American advance was hemmed into a corridor only wide between the ocean and the thick, inland jungle and steep coral ridges. The ridges, running perpendicular to the coast, paralleled numerous streams and creeks that crossed the corridor with "washboard regularity."

On 26 January, a combined US Army and Marine unit called the Composite Army-Marine (CAM) Division advancing westward encountered the Yano Battalion at the Marmura River. Yano's troops temporarily halted the CAM's advance and then slowly withdrew westward over the next three days. On 29 January, the Yano retreated across the Bonegi River, where soldiers from the 2nd Division had constructed another defensive position.

The Japanese defenses at the Bonegi held up the American advance for almost three days. On 1 February, with help from a shore bombardment by the destroyers and , the Americans successfully crossed the river but did not immediately press the advance westward.

The "Ke" air superiority campaign began in mid-January with nightly harassment attacks on Henderson Field by 3–10 aircraft, causing little damage. On 20 January, a lone <a href="Kawanishi%20H8K">Kawanishi H8K</a> bombed <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a>. On 25 January, the IJN sent 58 Zero fighters on a daylight raid to Guadalcanal. In response, the CAF sent aloft eight <a href="F4F%20Wildcat">Wildcat</a> and six <a href="P-38%20Lightning">P-38</a> fighters, which shot down four Zeros without loss.

A second large raid was conducted on 27 January by nine <a href="Kawasaki%20Ki-48">Kawasaki Ki-48</a> "Lily" light bombers escorted by 74 <a href="Nakajima%20Ki-43">Nakajima Ki-43</a> "Oscar" fighters from the IJA's 6th Air Division from Rabaul. Twelve Wildcats, six P-38s, and 10 <a href="Curtiss%20P-40">P-40s</a> from Henderson met the raid over Guadalcanal. In the resulting action, the Japanese lost six fighters while the CAF lost one Wildcat, four P-40s, and two P-38s. The "Lily"s dropped their bombs on American positions around the <a href="Matanikau%20River">Matanikau River</a>, causing little damage.

Believing that the Japanese were beginning a major offensive in the southern Solomons aimed at Henderson Field, Halsey responded by sending, beginning on 29 January, a resupply convoy to Guadalcanal supported by most of his warship forces, separated into five <a href="task%20force">task force</a>s. These five task forces included two fleet carriers, two escort carriers, three battleships, 12 cruisers, and 25 destroyers.
Screening the approach of the transport convoy was Task Force 18 (TF 18), under Rear Admiral <a href="Robert%20C.%20Giffen">Robert C. Giffen</a>, with three heavy and three light cruisers, two escort carriers, and eight destroyers. A fleet carrier task force, centered on carrier , steamed about behind TF 18.

In addition to protecting the supply convoy, TF 18 was charged with rendezvousing with a force of four U.S. destroyers, stationed at <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, at 21:00 on 29 January in order to conduct a sweep up "The Slot" north of Guadalcanal the next day to screen the unloading of the transports at Guadalcanal. As the escort carriers were too slow to allow Giffen's force to make the scheduled rendezvous, Giffen left the carriers behind with two destroyers at 14:00 on 29 January and steamed ahead.

Giffen's force was being tracked by Japanese submarines, who reported on Giffen's location and movement to their naval headquarters units. Around mid-afternoon, based on the submarine's reports, 16 G4M from the <a href="705%20Air%20Group">705 Air Group</a> and 16 <a href="Mitsubishi%20G3M">Mitsubishi G3M</a> "Nell" bombers from the <a href="701%20Air%20Group">701 Air Group</a> took off from Rabaul carrying torpedoes to attack Giffen's force, now located between <a href="Rennell%20Island">Rennell Island</a> and Guadalcanal.

The torpedo bombers attacked Giffen's ships in two waves between 19:00 and 20:00. Two torpedoes hit the heavy cruiser , causing heavy damage and bringing her to a dead stop. Three of the Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships. In response, Halsey sent a <a href="tugboat">tug</a> to take "Chicago" under tow and ordered Giffen's task force to return to base the next day. Six destroyers were left behind to escort "Chicago" and the tugboat.

At 16:00 on 30 January, a flight of 11 Mitsubishi torpedo bombers from the <a href="751%20Air%20Group">751 Air Group</a>, based at <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a> and staging through <a href="Buka%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Buka</a>, attacked the force towing "Chicago". Fighter aircraft from "Enterprise" shot down eight of them, but most of the Japanese aircraft were able to release their torpedoes before crashing. One torpedo hit the destroyer , causing heavy damage. Four more torpedoes hit "Chicago", sinking her.

The transport convoy reached Guadalcanal and successfully unloaded its cargo on 30–31 January. The rest of Halsey's warships took station in the <a href="Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a> south of the Solomons to wait for the approach of any Japanese warship forces supporting what the Allies believed to be an imminent offensive. The departure of TF 18 from the Guadalcanal area removed a significant potential threat to the "Ke" operation.

At 18:30 on 29 January, two <a href="corvette">corvette</a>s from the <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Navy">Royal New Zealand Navy</a>, and , intercepted the Japanese submarine , which was attempting a supply run, off of Kamimbo on Guadalcanal. The two corvettes rammed and sank "I-1" after a 90-minute battle ().

Leaving his cruisers at Kavieng, Mikawa gathered all 21 of his destroyers at the Japanese naval base in the Shortlands on 31 January to begin the evacuation runs. Rear Admiral <a href="Shintaro%20Hashimoto">Shintaro Hashimoto</a> was placed in charge of this group of destroyers, titled the Reinforcement Unit. The "R" Area Air Force's 60 floatplanes were tasked with scouting for the Reinforcement Unit and helping defend against Allied PT boat attacks during the nighttime evacuation runs. Allied B-17 bombers attacked the Shortlands anchorage on the morning of 1 February, causing no damage and losing four aircraft to Japanese fighters. This same day, the IJA's 6th Air Division raided Henderson Field with 23 "Oscar"s and six "Lily"s but caused no damage and suffered the loss of one fighter.
Believing that the Japanese might be retreating to the south coast of Guadalcanal, on the morning of 1 February Patch landed a reinforced battalion of army and Marine troops, about 1,500 men under the command of Colonel Alexander George, at Verahue on Guadalcanal's south coast. The U.S. troops were delivered to the landing location by a naval transport force of six <a href="landing%20craft%20tank">landing craft tank</a>s and one transport destroyer (), escorted by four other destroyers (the same destroyers that were to have joined TF 18 three days earlier). A Japanese reconnaissance aircraft spotted the naval landing force. Believing that the force posed a threat to that night's scheduled evacuation run, an airstrike of 13 <a href="Aichi%20D3A">Aichi D3A</a>2 "Val" <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s escorted by 40 Zeros departed Buin, Bougainville to attack the ships.

Mistaking the Japanese strike aircraft as friendly, the U.S. destroyers withheld fire until the "Val"s began their attack. Beginning at 14:53, destroyer was rapidly hit by three bombs and sank almost immediately south of <a href="Savo%20Island">Savo Island</a> with the loss of 167 of her crew, including her captain. Destroyer was damaged by several near-misses. Five "Val"s and three Zeros were lost to anti-aircraft fire and CAF fighters. The CAF lost three Wildcats in the engagement.

Hashimoto departed the Shortlands at 11:30 on 1 February with 20 destroyers for the first evacuation run. Eleven destroyers were designated as transports screened by the other nine. The destroyers were attacked in the late afternoon near <a href="Vangunu">Vangunu</a> by 92 CAF aircraft in two waves. , Hashimoto's flagship, was heavily damaged by a near miss. Four CAF aircraft were shot down. Hashimoto transferred to and detached to tow "Makinami" back to base.

Eleven U.S. PT boats awaited Hashimoto's destroyers between Guadalcanal and <a href="Savo%20Island">Savo Island</a>. Beginning at 22:45, Hashimoto's warships and the PT boats engaged in a series of running battles over the next three hours. Hashimoto's destroyers, with help from "R" Area aircraft, sank three of the PT boats.

In the meantime, the transport destroyers arrived off of two pick-up locations at Cape Esperance and Kamimbo at 22:40 and 24:00 respectively. Japanese naval personnel ferried the waiting troops out to the destroyers in barges and landing craft. Rear Admiral <a href="Tomiji%20Koyanagi">Tomiji Koyanagi</a>, second-in-command of the Reinforcement Unit, described the evacuees: "They wore only the remains of clothes that were so soiled their physical deterioration was extreme. Probably they were happy but they showed no expression. Their digestive organs were so completely destroyed, we couldn't give them good food, only porridge." Another officer added that, "Their buttocks were so emaciated that their anuses were completely exposed, and on the destroyers that picked them up they suffered from constant and uncontrolled diarrhea."

After embarking 4,935 soldiers, mainly from the 38th Division, the transport destroyers ceased loading at 01:58 and prepared to depart for the return trip to the Shortlands. About this time, , one of the screening destroyers, was suddenly wracked by a large explosion, caused by either a PT boat torpedo or a <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>. Informed that "Makigumo" was immobilized, Hashimoto ordered her abandoned and scuttled (). During the return trip, the Reinforcement Unit was attacked by CAF aircraft at 08:00, but sustained no damage and arrived at the Shortlands without further incident at 12:00 on 2 February.

On 4 February, Patch ordered the 161st Infantry Regiment to replace the 147th at the front and resume the advance westward. The Yano battalion retreated to new positions at the Segilau River and troops were sent to block the advance of George's force along the south coast. Meanwhile, Halsey's carrier and battleship task forces remained just beyond Japanese air attack range about south of Guadalcanal.
Kondō sent two of his force's destroyers, and , to the Shortlands to replace the two destroyers lost in the first evacuation run. Hashimoto led the second evacuation mission with 20 destroyers south toward Guadalcanal at 11:30 on 4 February. The CAF attacked Hashimoto in two waves beginning at 15:50 with a total of 74 aircraft. Bomb near-misses heavily damaged , and Hashimoto detached to tow her back to Shortland. The CAF lost 11 aircraft in the attack while the Japanese lost one Zero.

The U.S. PT boats did not sortie to attack Hashimoto's force this night and the loading went uneventfully. The Reinforcement Force embarked Hyakutake, his staff, and 3,921 men, mainly from the 2nd Division, and reached Bougainville without incident by 12:50 on 5 February. A CAF airstrike launched that morning failed to locate Hashimoto's force.

Believing that the Japanese operations on 1 and 4 February had been reinforcement, not evacuation missions, the American forces on Guadalcanal proceeded slowly and cautiously, advancing only about each day. George's force halted on 6 February after advancing to Titi on the south coast. On the north coast, the 161st finally began their attack westward at 10:00 on 6 February and reached the Umasani River the same day. At the same time, the Japanese were withdrawing their remaining 2,000 troops to Kamimbo.

On 7 February, the 161st crossed the Umasani and reached Bunina, about from Cape Esperance. George's force, now commanded by George F. Ferry, advanced from Titi to <a href="Maravovo">Marovovo</a> and dug in for the night about north of the village.

Aware of the presence of Halsey's carriers and other large warships near Guadalcanal, the Japanese considered canceling the third evacuation run, but decided to go ahead as planned. Kondō's force closed to within of Guadalcanal from the north to be ready in case Halsey's warships attempted to intervene. Hashimoto departed the Shortlands with 18 destroyers midday of 7 February, this time taking a course south of the Solomons instead of down the Slot. A CAF strike force of 36 aircraft attacked Hashimoto at 17:55, heavily damaging with a bomb near miss. "Isokaze" retired escorted by "Kawakaze". The Allies and the Japanese each lost one aircraft in the attack.

Arriving off Kamimbo, Hashimoto's force loaded 1,972 soldiers by 00:03 on 8 February, unhindered by the U.S. Navy. For an additional 90 minutes, destroyer crewmen rowed their boats along the shore calling out again and again to make sure no one was left behind. At 01:32, the Reinforcement Group left Guadalcanal in its wake and reached Bougainville without incident at 10:00, completing the operation.

At dawn on 8 February, the U.S. Army forces on both coasts resumed their advances, encountering only a few sick and dying Japanese soldiers. Patch now realized that the Tokyo Express runs over the last week were evacuation, not reinforcement missions. At 16:50 on 9 February, the two American forces met on the west coast at the village of Tenaro. Patch sent a message to Halsey stating, "Total and complete defeat of Japanese forces on Guadalcanal effected 16:25 today...the Tokyo Express no longer has a terminus on Guadalcanal."

The Japanese had successfully evacuated a total of 10,652 men from Guadalcanal, about all that remained of the 36,000 total troops sent to the island during the campaign. Six hundred of the evacuees succumbed to their injuries or illnesses before they could receive sufficient medical care. Three thousand more required lengthy hospitalization or recuperation. After receiving word of the completion of the operation, Yamamoto commended all the units involved and ordered Kondō to return to Truk with his warships. The 2nd and 38th Divisions were shipped to Rabaul and partially reconstituted with replacements. The 2nd Division was relocated to the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> in March 1943 while the 38th was assigned to defend Rabaul and <a href="New%20Ireland%20%28island%29">New Ireland</a>. The <a href="8th%20Area%20Army">8th Area Army</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Area%20Fleet">Southeast Area Fleet</a> reoriented their forces to defend the central Solomons at <a href="Kolombangara">Kolombangara</a> and <a href="New%20Georgia">New Georgia</a> and prepared to send the reinforcements, mainly consisting of the 51st Infantry Division, originally detailed for Guadalcanal to New Guinea. The <a href="Seventeenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">17th Army</a> was rebuilt around the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">6th Infantry Division</a> and headquartered on Bougainville. A few Japanese stragglers remained on Guadalcanal, many of whom were killed or captured by Allied patrols. The last known <a href="Japanese%20holdout">Japanese holdout</a> surrendered in October 1947.

In hindsight, historians have faulted the Americans, especially Patch and Halsey, for not taking advantage of their ground, aerial, and naval superiority to prevent the successful Japanese evacuation of most of their surviving forces from Guadalcanal. Said <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a>, commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, of the success of Operation Ke, "Until the last moment it appeared that the Japanese were attempting a major reinforcement effort. Only the skill in keeping their plans disguised and bold celerity in carrying them out enabled the Japanese to withdraw the remnants of the Guadalcanal garrison. Not until all organized forces had been evacuated on 8 February did we realize the purpose of their air and naval dispositions."

Nevertheless, the successful campaign to recapture Guadalcanal from the Japanese was an important strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan's defeat and the end of World .

Lambeosaurus

Lambeosaurus ( ; meaning "<a href="Lawrence%20Lambe">Lambe's</a> lizard") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="hadrosaurid">hadrosaurid</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived about 75 million years ago, in the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="period%20%28geology%29">period</a> (<a href="Campanian">Campanian</a>) of North America. This <a href="bipedalism">bipedal</a>/<a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>al, <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a> dinosaur is known for its distinctive hollow cranial crest, which in the best-known species resembled a <a href="hatchet">hatchet</a>. Several possible species have been named, from Canada, the United States, and Mexico, but only the two Canadian species are currently recognized as valid.

Material relevant to the genus was first named by <a href="Lawrence%20Lambe">Lawrence Lambe</a> in 1902. Over twenty years later, the modern name was coined in 1923 by <a href="William%20Parks%20%28paleontologist%29">William Parks</a>, in honour of Lambe, based on better preserved specimens. The genus has a complicated <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history, in part because small-bodied crested hadrosaurids now recognized as <a href="juvenile%20%28organism%29">juveniles</a> were once thought to belong to their own genera and <a href="species">species</a>. Currently, the various skulls assigned to the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> "L. lambei" are interpreted as showing age differences and <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>. "Lambeosaurus" was closely related to the better known "<a href="Corythosaurus">Corythosaurus</a>", which is found in slightly older rocks, as well as the less well-known genera "<a href="Hypacrosaurus">Hypacrosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Olorotitan">Olorotitan</a>". All had unusual crests, which are now generally assumed to have served social functions like noisemaking and recognition.

"Lambeosaurus" has a complicated <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history, beginning in 1902 with <a href="Lawrence%20Lambe">Lawrence Lambe</a>'s naming of hadrosaurid limb material and other bones (originally <a href="Geological%20Survey%20of%20Canada">GSC</a> 419) from Alberta as "<a href="Trachodon">Trachodon</a> marginatus". In the same publication "Trachodon altidens", a left <a href="maxilla">upper jaw</a> (GSC 1092) from the <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a> was also described by Lambe. In the same volume, <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a> suggested "T. altidens" could belong to a new genus, which he labelled "Didanodon" without further discussion.

Paleontologists began finding better remains of hadrosaurids from the same rocks in the 1910s, in what is now known as the <a href="Campanian">late Campanian</a>-age (<a href="Upper%20Cretaceous">Upper Cretaceous</a>) <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a>. Lambe assigned two new skulls to "T. marginatus", and based on the new information, coined the genus "<a href="Stephanosaurus">Stephanosaurus</a>" for the species in 1914. Unfortunately, there was very little to associate the skulls with the scrappy earlier "marginatus" material, so in 1923 <a href="William%20Parks%20%28paleontologist%29">William Parks</a> proposed a new genus and species for the skulls, with both generic and specific names honoring Lambe (who had died four years earlier): "Lambeosaurus lambei" (<a href="biological%20type">type specimen</a> <a href="Canadian%20Museum%20of%20Nature">NMC</a> 2869, originally GSC 2869). In the same publication, this species was made the type genus of the new subfamily <a href="Lambeosaurinae">Lambeosaurinae</a>, as a replacement for the pre-existed Stephanosaurinae.

Although the early workers in Alberta did not recognize it at the time, they were finding the remains of juvenile "Lambeosaurus" as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. In 1920, <a href="William%20Diller%20Matthew">William Diller Matthew</a> used the name "Procheneosaurus" (no species name) in a brief mention of a skeleton at the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, from the Dinosaur Park Formation (<a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">AMNH</a> 5340). Parks believed that the procedure and description were inadequate for the name to be considered valid, and to address the situation, he coined the genus "Tetragonosaurus". Into this genus he placed the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> "T. praeceps" (based on <a href="Royal%20Ontario%20Museum">ROM</a> 3577) and a second species "T. erectofrons" (based on ROM 3578) for small skulls from the Dinosaur Park Formation, and assigned Matthew's "Procheneosaurus" skeleton to "T. praeceps". <a href="Charles%20Mortram%20Sternberg">Charles M. Sternberg</a> followed in 1935 by adding the slightly larger "T. cranibrevis", based on GSC (now NMC) 8633. 

The use of "Tetragonosaurus" was rejected by <a href="Richard%20Swann%20Lull">Richard Swann Lull</a> in favor of "Procheneosaurus". Lull requested that the name "Tetragonosaurus" be suppressed in favor of "Procheneosaurus", which was granted, and "Procheneosaurus" received official approval from the ICZN as a <a href="conserved%20name">conserved name</a>. In 1942 he and Wright transferred the "Tetragonosaurus" species and, tentatively, "Trachodon" "altidens", to "Procheneosaurus", with "P. praeceps" serving as the type species. This usage was generally followed until 1975, when <a href="Peter%20Dodson">Peter Dodson</a> proposed all three species were actually <a href="juvenile%20%28organism%29">juveniles</a> of "Lambeosaurus".

""Procheneosaurus"" "convincens", from the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> of <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, is known from a nearly complete skeleton missing only the snout and end of the tail. It was named by <a href="Anatoly%20Konstantinovich%20Rozhdestvensky">A. K. Rozhdestvensky</a> in 1968. It has at times been considered synonymous with "<a href="Jaxartosaurus">Jaxartosaurus aralensis</a>", or deserving of its own genus. Bell and Brink (2013) made "P." "convincens" the type species of the new genus "<a href="Kazaklambia">Kazaklambia</a>".

The "cheneosaurines" weren't the only crested duckbills being studied and named in the early 1900s. It was then the accepted practice to name genera and species for what is now seen as more likely individual variation, variation due to age or sex, or distortion from fossilization. Three more species were named during this period that relate to "Lambeosaurus", all in 1935. Sternberg, in the same paper as "T. cranibrevis", named a skull and partial skeleton (GSC-8705, now NMC—8705) "L. magnicristatum" (corrected in 1937 to "magnicristatus"), and a smaller skull (GSC—8705, now NMC—8703) "L. clavinitialis", with a less prominent crest and reduced spine pointing from the back. Parks contributed "Corythosaurus frontalis", based on skull GSC 5853 (now ROM 869), which differed from the well-known tall, straight, rounded crest of other specimens of "Corythosaurus" by having a low crest cocked forward.

New specimens were not described for many years following the activity of the early 1900s. In 1964 <a href="John%20Ostrom">John Ostrom</a> noted that an old species named by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>, "<a href="Hadrosaurus">Hadrosaurus</a> paucidens", based on <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">USNM</a> 5457, a partial <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> and <a href="squamosal">squamosal</a> from the <a href="Judith%20River%20Formation">Judith River Formation</a> of <a href="Fergus%20County%2C%20Montana">Fergus County</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, was probably a specimen of "Lambeosaurus".

In 1975, Peter Dodson, examining why there should be so many species and genera of lambeosaurine duckbills within such a short geological time frame and small area, published the results of a <a href="morphometrics">morphometric</a> study in which he measured dozens of skulls. He found that many of the species had been based on remains that were better interpreted as juveniles or different sexes, something touched on but largely ignored in older literature. For "Lambeosaurus", he found that "L. clavinitialis" was probably the female of "L. lambei", and "Corythosaurus frontalis" and "Procheneosaurus praeceps" were probably its juveniles. "L. magnicristatus" was different enough to warrant its own species. He interpreted "Procheneosaurus cranibrevis" and "P. erectofrons" as juvenile corythosaurs. However, restudy of the "Procheneosaurus"/"Tetragonosaurus" remains indicates that within species, assignments had become confused, and the type specimen of "P. cranibrevis" was a "Lambeosaurus" juvenile, whereas others were "Corythosaurus", based on the distinctive form of the contact of the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a> with the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>.

Dodson's model would become widely accepted, and two species of "Lambeosaurus" are regularly recognized today, with a third sometimes accepted. "L. lambei" (Parks, 1923) is known from at least 17 individuals, with seven skulls and partial skeletons and around ten isolated skulls. "L. clavinitialis" (C.M. Sternberg, 1935), "Corythosaurus frontalis" (Parks, 1935), and "Procheneosaurus praeceps" (Parks, 1931) are all still regarded as synonyms of "L. lambei" in recent reviws. Some palaeontologists suggest that "L. clavinitialis" skulls without the backward spine may represent "L. magnicristatus" individuals instead,; this was rejected in the 2007 redescription of "L. magnicristatus". 

The second species, "L. magnicristatus" (C.M. Sternberg, 1935) is only definitely known from two specimens, both with skulls. Unfortunately, the majority of the articulated skeleton of the type specimen has been lost. Many of the bones were extensively damaged by water while in storage and were discarded before description; other portions of this skeleton have also been lost. Its remains come from slightly younger rocks than "L. lambei". The specific name is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "magnus" "large" and "cristatus" "crested", referring to its bony crest. Additionally, <a href="Jack%20Horner%20%28paleontologist%29">Jack Horner</a> has identified fragmentary lambeosaurine jaws from the <a href="Bearpaw%20Formation">Bearpaw Formation</a> of <a href="Montana">Montana</a> as possibly belonging to "L. magnicristatus"; these represent the first lambeosaurine remains from <a href="marine%20%28ocean%29">marine</a> rocks.

Other less accepted species have been discussed in the 21st century. "Lambeosaurus paucidens" (named by <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Marsh</a> 1889 and referred to "Lambeosaurus" in 1964) is generally regarded as a <a href="nomen%20dubium">dubious name</a> and was listed as "Hadrosaurus paucidens" in a 2004 review, although at least one author, <a href="Donald%20F.%20Glut">Donald F. Glut</a>, has accepted it as a species of "Lambeosaurus". In this case, the specific epithet is derived from the Latin "pauci-" "few" and "dens" "tooth". The irregularities of "Procheneosaurus cranibrevis", and the identity of the type as a juvenile lambeosaur, were recognized in 2005. Finally, "Didanodon "altidens"" has been assigned without comment to "Lambeosaurus" in two 21st Century reviews.

During the late 1970s, <a href="William%20J.%20Morris">Bill Morris</a> was studying giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them "L."? "laticaudus" in 1981 (type specimen <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20of%20Los%20Angeles%20County">LACM</a> 17715). Morris used a question mark in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like "Lambeosaurus". He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a <a href="ability%20to%20swim">swimming</a> adaptation), and weak <a href="pelvis">hip</a> articulations, as well as a healed broken <a href="femur">thigh bone</a> that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus "<a href="Magnapaulia">Magnapaulia</a>".

"Lambeosaurus", best known through "L. lambei", was quite similar to "<a href="Corythosaurus">Corythosaurus</a>" in everything but the form of the head adornment. Compared to "Corythosaurus", the crest of "Lambeosaurus" was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were at the front of the crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from "Corythosaurus" by its lack of forking <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal</a> <a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">processes</a> making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.

"Lambeosaurus" was like other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, as shown by footprints of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by <a href="ossify">ossified tendons</a> that prevented it from drooping. The hands had four fingers, lacking the <a href="thumb">innermost finger</a> of the generalized five-fingered <a href="tetrapod">tetrapod</a> hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore <a href="hoof">hooves</a>, suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The <a href="little%20finger">fifth finger</a> was free and could be used to manipulate objects. Each foot had only the three central toes.

The most distinctive feature, the crest, was different in the two well-known species. In "L. lambei", it had a hatchet-like shape when the dinosaur was full-grown, and was somewhat shorter and more rounded in specimens interpreted as females. The "hatchet blade" projected in front of the eyes, and the "handle" was a solid bony rod that jutted out over the back of the skull. The "hatchet blade" had two sections: the uppermost portion was a thin bony "<a href="Comb%20%28anatomy%29">coxcomb</a>" that grew out relatively late in life, when an individual neared adulthood; and the lower portion held hollow spaces that were continuations of the nasal passages. In "L. magnicristatus", the "handle" was greatly reduced, and the "blade" expanded, forming a tall, exaggerated <a href="pompadour%20%28hairstyle%29">pompadour</a>-like crest. This crest is damaged in the best overall specimen, and only the front half remains.

The Canadian species of "Lambeosaurus" appear to have been similar in size to "Corythosaurus", and thus around long. Impressions of the <a href="scale%20%28zoology%29">scales</a> are known for several specimens; a specimen now assigned to "L. lambei" had a thin <a href="skin">skin</a> with uniform, polygonal <a href="scute">scute</a>s distributed in no particular order on the neck, torso, and tail. Similar scalation is known from the neck, forelimb, and foot of a specimen of "L. magnicristatus".

"Lambeosaurus" is the <a href="biological%20type">type genus</a> of the <a href="Lambeosaurinae">Lambeosaurinae</a>, the <a href="scientific%20classification">subfamily</a> of hadrosaurids that had hollow skull crests. Among the lambeosaurines, it is closely related to similar dinosaurs such as "Corythosaurus" and "<a href="Hypacrosaurus">Hypacrosaurus</a>", with little separating them but crest form. The relationships among these dinosaur genera are difficult to pick out. Some early classifications placed these genera in the tribe Corythosaurini, which was found by David Evans and Robert Reisz to include "Lambeosaurus" as the <a href="cladistics">sister taxon</a> to a clade made up of "Corythosaurus", "Hypacrosaurus", and the Russian genus "<a href="Olorotitan">Olorotitan</a>"; these lambeosaurines, with "<a href="Nipponosaurus">Nipponosaurus</a>". However, later researchers pointed out that due to the rules of priority set forth by the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">ICZN</a>, any tribe containing "Lambeosaurus" is properly named <a href="Lambeosaurini">Lambeosaurini</a>, and that therefore the name "Corythosaurini" is a junior synonym. The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> illustrating the relationships of "Lambeosaurus" and its close relatives was recovered in a 2012 phylogenetic analysis by Albert Prieto-Márquez, Luis M. Chiappe and Shantanu H. Joshi.

As a hadrosaurid, "Lambeosaurus" was a large bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating <a href="plant">plant</a>s with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to <a href="mammal">mammal</a>ian <a href="mastication">chewing</a>. Its <a href="tooth">teeth</a> were continually replaced and were packed into dental batteries that each contained over 100 teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. It used its beak to crop plant material, which was held in the jaws by a <a href="cheek">cheek</a>-like organ. Feeding would have been from the ground up to around above. As noted by <a href="Robert%20T.%20Bakker">Bob Bakker</a>, lambeosaurines have narrower beaks than hadrosaurines, implying that "Lambeosaurus" and its relatives could feed more selectively than their broad-beaked, crestless counterparts.

Like other <a href="Lambeosaurinae">lambeosaurines</a> such as "<a href="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a>" and "<a href="Corythosaurus">Corythosaurus</a>", "Lambeosaurus" had a distinctive crest on the top of its head. Its nasal cavity ran back through this crest, making it mostly hollow. Many suggestions have been made for the function or functions of the crest, including housing <a href="salt%20gland">salt gland</a>s, improving the <a href="olfaction">sense of smell</a>, use as a snorkel or air trap, acting as a resonating chamber for making sounds, or being a method for different species or different sexes of the same species to recognize each other. Social functions such as noisemaking and recognition have become the most widely accepted of the various hypotheses.

The large size of hadrosaurid <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">eye sockets</a> and the presence of <a href="sclerotic%20ring">sclerotic ring</a>s in the eyes imply acute vision and <a href="diurnal%20animal">diurnal</a> habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. The hadrosaurid sense of <a href="hearing%20%28sense%29">hearing</a> also appears to be strong. There is at least one example, in the related "Corythosaurus", of a slender <a href="stapes">stapes</a> (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an <a href="eardrum">eardrum</a> implies a sensitive <a href="middle%20ear">middle ear</a>, and the hadrosaurid <a href="Lagena%20%28anatomy%29">lagena</a> is elongate like a <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>n's. This indicates that the auditory portion of the <a href="inner%20ear">inner ear</a> was well-developed. If used as a noisemaker, the crest could also have provided recognizable differences for different species or sexes, because the differing layouts of the nasal passages corresponding to the different crest shapes would have produced intrinsically different sounds.

"Lambeosaurus lambei" and "L. magnicristatus", from the <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a>, were members of a diverse and well-documented <a href="fauna">fauna</a> of prehistoric animals that included such well-known dinosaurs as the <a href="ceratopsidae">horned</a> "<a href="Centrosaurus">Centrosaurus</a>", "<a href="Styracosaurus">Styracosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Chasmosaurus">Chasmosaurus</a>", fellow duckbills "<a href="Prosaurolophus">Prosaurolophus</a>", "<a href="Gryposaurus">Gryposaurus</a>", "Corythosaurus", and "<a href="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a>", <a href="tyrannosaurid">tyrannosaurid</a> "<a href="Gorgosaurus">Gorgosaurus</a>", and <a href="ankylosauria">armored</a> "<a href="Edmontonia">Edmontonia</a>" and "<a href="Euoplocephalus">Euoplocephalus</a>". The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of <a href="river">river</a>s and <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s that became more <a href="swamp">swamp</a>y and influenced by <a href="ocean">marine</a> conditions over time as the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a> <a href="transgression%20%28geology%29">transgressed</a> westward. The <a href="climate">climate</a> was warmer than present-day Alberta, without <a href="frost">frost</a>, but with wetter and drier seasons. <a href="Conifer">Conifer</a>s were apparently the dominant <a href="forest%20canopy">canopy</a> plants, with an <a href="understory">understory</a> of <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="tree%20fern">tree fern</a>s, and <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a>s. The anatomically similar "L. lambei", "L. magnicristatus", and "Corythosaurus" were separated by time within the formation, based on <a href="stratigraphy">stratigraphy</a>. "Corythosaurus" fossils are known from the lower two-thirds of the Formation, "L. lambei" fossils are present in the upper third, and "L. magnicristatus" remains are rare and present only at the very top, where the marine influence was greater.

Vidya Balan

Vidya Balan (pronounced ; born 1 January 1979) is an Indian actress. Known for pioneering a change in the concept of a <a href="Bollywood">Hindi film</a> heroine with her portrayals of strong-willed women, she is the recipient of <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Vidya%20Balan">several awards</a>, including a <a href="National%20Film%20Awards">National Film Award</a>, six <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>, and six <a href="Screen%20Awards">Screen Awards</a>. She was awarded the <a href="Padma%20Shri">Padma Shri</a> by the <a href="Government%20of%20India">Government of India</a> in 2014.

Vidya aspired to a career in film from a young age and had her first acting role in the 1995 sitcom "<a href="Hum%20Paanch%20%28TV%20series%29">Hum Paanch</a>". She pursued a master's degree in sociology from the <a href="University%20of%20Mumbai">University of Mumbai</a> and simultaneously made several unsuccessful attempts to start a career in film. She subsequently featured in television commercials and music videos. In 2003 she made her feature film debut as the protagonist of the independent <a href="Cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal">Bengal</a>i drama "<a href="Bhalo%20Theko">Bhalo Theko</a>". In 2005 Vidya garnered praise for her first Hindi film, the drama "<a href="Parineeta%20%282005%20film%29">Parineeta</a>", and followed it with a leading role in the top-grossing comedy film "<a href="Lage%20Raho%20Munna%20Bhai">Lage Raho Munna Bhai</a>" (2006).

This breakthrough was followed by roles in the romantic comedies "<a href="Heyy%20Babyy">Heyy Babyy</a>" (2007) and "<a href="Kismat%20Konnection">Kismat Konnection</a>" (2008) which had negative reviews. Vidya went on to establish herself as a leading actress of Hindi cinema by playing five consecutive roles to wide critical acclaim in the 2009 drama "<a href="Paa%20%28film%29">Paa</a>", the 2010 black comedy "<a href="Ishqiya">Ishqiya</a>", the 2011 semi-biographical thriller "<a href="No%20One%20Killed%20Jessica">No One Killed Jessica</a>", the 2011 biopic "<a href="The%20Dirty%20Picture">The Dirty Picture</a>", and the 2012 thriller "<a href="Kahaani">Kahaani</a>". She followed this with a series of films that performed poorly at the box office, although her performance in "" (2016) was praised. This changed in 2017 when she starred as a radio jockey in the successful comedy-drama "<a href="Tumhari%20Sulu">Tumhari Sulu</a>".

In addition to acting in films, Vidya promotes humanitarian causes and supports the empowerment of women. She initially drew criticism for her fluctuating weight and "questionable" dress sense, but was later credited in the media for "not morphing herself to fit into any conventional slot". She became a member of the Indian <a href="Central%20Board%20of%20Film%20Certification">Central Board of Film Certification</a> in 2017. Vidya is married to the film producer <a href="Siddharth%20Roy%20Kapur">Siddharth Roy Kapur</a>.

Vidya Balan was born on 1 January 1979 in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, to parents of <a href="Tamil%20people">Tamilian</a> descent. Her father, P. R. Balan, is the executive vice-president of Digicable and her mother, Saraswathy Balan, is a homemaker. According to Vidya, they speak a mix of <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> and <a href="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> at home. Her elder sister, Priya Balan, works in advertising. The actress <a href="Priyamani">Priyamani</a> is her second cousin.

Vidya grew up in the suburban neighbourhood of <a href="Chembur">Chembur, Mumbai</a> and attended St. Anthony Girls' High School. From a young age, she aspired to a career in film and was inspired by the work of actors <a href="Shabana%20Azmi">Shabana Azmi</a> and <a href="Madhuri%20Dixit">Madhuri Dixit</a>. At the age of 16, she starred in the first season of <a href="Ekta%20Kapoor">Ekta Kapoor</a>'s sitcom "<a href="Hum%20Paanch%20%28TV%20series%29">Hum Paanch</a>" as Radhika, a bespectacled teenager. After the series ended, Vidya refused director <a href="Anurag%20Basu">Anurag Basu</a>'s offer to star in a television soap opera, as she wanted to concentrate on a film career. Her parents were supportive of the decision but encouraged her to complete her education first. She attended <a href="St.%20Xavier%27s%20College%2C%20Mumbai">St. Xavier's College</a> to pursue a bachelor's degree in <a href="sociology">sociology</a> and later earned a master's degree from the <a href="University%20of%20Mumbai">University of Mumbai</a>.

While pursuing her master's degree, Vidya was cast as the female lead in the <a href="Malayalam%20cinema">Malayalam film</a> "Chakram", opposite <a href="Mohanlal">Mohanlal</a> and was subsequently signed on for 12 other Malayalam language films. However, due to production difficulties, "Chakram" was shelved. The postponement of a film starring Mohanlal was an unheard occurrence in Malayalam cinema and producers blamed Vidya for bringing "bad luck" to the project; labelled her as a "jinx"; and replaced her in the films that she had been contracted for. She shifted focus to <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil cinema</a>. In 2001, she was cast as the female lead in <a href="N.%20Linguswamy">N. Linguswamy</a>'s "<a href="Run%20%282002%20film%29">Run</a>" (2002). However, after completing the first <a href="shooting%20schedule">shooting schedule</a>, she was unceremoniously dropped and replaced by <a href="Meera%20Jasmine">Meera Jasmine</a>. She was signed up under false pretences for a <a href="sex%20comedy">sex comedy</a>, a genre she was uncomfortable with, and decided to leave the project. Thereafter, she signed on for a third Tamil film, "<a href="Manasellam">Manasellam</a>" (2003), but was replaced by <a href="Trisha%20%28actress%29">Trisha</a> as the director was dissatisfied with her work. "<a href="Kalari%20Vikraman">Kalari Vikraman</a>", another Malayalam film that she completed work for in 2003, failed to get a theatrical release. After failing to start a film career, Vidya appeared in approximately 60 television commercials and in music videos for <a href="Euphoria%20%28Indian%20band%29">Euphoria</a> and <a href="Shubha%20Mudgal">Shubha Mudgal</a>; a majority of these were directed by <a href="Pradeep%20Sarkar">Pradeep Sarkar</a>.

In 2003, Vidya was signed on by <a href="Goutam%20Halder">Goutam Halder</a> for his independent <a href="Cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal">Bengali</a> drama "<a href="Bhalo%20Theko">Bhalo Theko</a>": her first film release. Her portrayal of Anandi, a young woman reminiscing about her past, won her an <a href="Anandalok%20Awards">Anandalok Purashkar</a> for Best Actress. Vidya made her Hindi film debut in 2005 with Pradeep Sarkar's musical drama "<a href="Parineeta%20%282005%20film%29">Parineeta</a>". Before being cast, she had to undergo extensive auditions for six months. The film, an adaptation of <a href="Sarat%20Chandra%20Chattopadhyay">Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay</a>'s <a href="Parineeta%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a>, narrated the love story of an idealist Lalita (Vidya) and a musician Shekhar (<a href="Saif%20Ali%20Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a>), the son of a capitalist businessman. Her performance in the film was praised by critics; Derek Elley from "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" wrote, "An acting revelation is Tamil newcomer [Vidya] Balan, whose devoted but dignified Lalita is the picture's heart and soul." "Parineeta" fetched her a <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Female%20Debut%20Award">Best Female Debut</a> award and a nomination for <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Actress%20Award">Best Actress</a> at the annual <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a> ceremony. The following year, Vidya appeared opposite <a href="Sanjay%20Dutt">Sanjay Dutt</a> in <a href="Rajkumar%20Hirani">Rajkumar Hirani</a>'s comedy film "<a href="Lage%20Raho%20Munna%20Bhai">Lage Raho Munna Bhai</a>". She portrayed the role of Jhanvi, a <a href="Radio%20personality">radio jockey</a> and the love interest of the protagonist <a href="Munna%20Bhai">Munna Bhai</a>. To prepare for her role, she met with a couple of radio jockeys and watched them at work. Her performance was critically well received, and the film emerged as a major financial success with earnings of .

In 2007 Vidya featured in a supporting role in <a href="Mani%20Ratnam">Mani Ratnam</a>'s semi-biographical drama "<a href="Guru%20%282007%20film%29">Guru</a>" as a woman suffering from <a href="multiple%20sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a>. The film, which starred <a href="Mithun%20Chakraborty">Mithun Chakraborty</a>, <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a>, <a href="Aishwarya%20Rai%20Bachchan">Aishwarya Rai Bachchan</a>, and <a href="R.%20Madhavan">R. Madhavan</a> in leading roles, performed well at the box office. However, film critics <a href="Khalid%20Mohamed">Khalid Mohamed</a> and <a href="Raja%20Sen">Raja Sen</a> noted that her "talent was wasted" in a "minuscule role". Her next release was <a href="Nikhil%20Advani">Nikhil Advani</a>'s "", a romantic comedy featuring an <a href="ensemble%20cast">ensemble cast</a>, in which she was paired opposite <a href="John%20Abraham%20%28actor%29">John Abraham</a>. The film, which narrated six love stories, saw Vidya play the role of a television reporter, Tehzeeb Hussain, suffering from a <a href="Amnesia">memory loss condition</a>. The film, which was a critical and commercial failure, generated positive reviews for Vidya. Sukanya Verma of <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> wrote, "Vidya's transformation from a self-assured working woman to a helpless, vulnerable person is superb."

Vidya then took a supporting role in <a href="Vidhu%20Vinod%20Chopra">Vidhu Vinod Chopra</a>'s drama "", alongside <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, <a href="Boman%20Irani">Boman Irani</a>, <a href="Sharmila%20Tagore">Sharmila Tagore</a>, Saif Ali Khan, and Sanjay Dutt. The film, which failed commercially, met with positive critical reviews and was selected as <a href="List%20of%20Indian%20submissions%20for%20the%20Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">India's official entry to the Oscars</a> for the <a href="80th%20Academy%20Awards">80th Academy Awards</a>. She was later cast as Isha Sahni, a single mother, in <a href="Sajid%20Khan%20%28director%29">Sajid Khan</a>'s "<a href="Heyy%20Babyy">Heyy Babyy</a>", alongside co-stars <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>, <a href="Ritesh%20Deshmukh">Ritesh Deshmukh</a>, and <a href="Fardeen%20Khan">Fardeen Khan</a>. The comedy was a box-office success but garnered negative reviews from critics, as did Vidya's performance; <a href="CNN-IBN">CNN-IBN</a>'s <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> criticised her wardrobe and make-up, and considered her the "sore thumb" of the film.

Vidya's fifth and final film of 2007 was <a href="Priyadarshan">Priyadarshan</a>'s "<a href="Bhool%20Bhulaiyaa">Bhool Bhulaiyaa</a>", a remake of the Malayalam film "<a href="Manichitrathazhu">Manichitrathazhu</a>" (1993). Vidya featured as Avani Chaturvedi (a character played by <a href="Shobana">Shobana</a> in the Malayalam original), a woman suffering from <a href="dissociative%20identity%20disorder">dissociative identity disorder</a>. Co-starring <a href="Shiney%20Ahuja">Shiney Ahuja</a>, Akshay Kumar, and <a href="Ameesha%20Patel">Ameesha Patel</a>, "Bhool Bhulaiyaa" was a commercial success with a worldwide revenue of over . Reviewers, while being generally negative of the film, were appreciative of Vidya's performance. Writing for "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>", Khalid Mohamed described her as "bankably likeable" and <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a>'s <a href="Taran%20Adarsh">Taran Adarsh</a> labelled her as "splendid". The role earned Vidya a second Filmfare nomination in the Best Actress category.

In 2008's "<a href="Halla%20Bol">Halla Bol</a>", Vidya played a supporting role alongside <a href="Ajay%20Devgn">Ajay Devgn</a> and <a href="Pankaj%20Kapur">Pankaj Kapur</a>. The story was based on the life of activist <a href="Safdar%20Hashmi">Safdar Hashmi</a>, who was killed by political rivals while performing in a street play ("Halla Bol") in 1989. The film was a critical failure. Later that year, she co-starred with <a href="Shahid%20Kapoor">Shahid Kapoor</a> in <a href="Aziz%20Mirza">Aziz Mirza</a>'s romantic comedy "<a href="Kismat%20Konnection">Kismat Konnection</a>". Faring poorly at the box office, the film and her performance generated a negative response; critic Sonia Chopra commented, "[Balan] is made to look downright drab. The haircut is unflattering, the make-up too plain, the clothes usually in off-white or brown. Plus the character is repetitive and reminds us of the one she played in "Lage Raho Munna Bhai"."

In 2009 Vidya played the role of an unwed <a href="gynaecologist">gynaecologist</a> struggling with her 12-year-old son's <a href="progeria%20syndrome">progeria syndrome</a>, in the <a href="R.%20Balki">R. Balki</a>-directed <a href="dramedy">dramedy</a> "<a href="Paa%20%28film%29">Paa</a>". Amitabh Bachchan played the role of Vidya's son and Abhishek Bachchan played the title character. A critical and commercial success, the film has been described as a major turning point in her career. Sukanya Verma compared her acting style to that of <a href="Dimple%20Kapadia">Dimple Kapadia</a> and noted, "Balan is poignant yet restrained and projects an impressive figure of grace and integrity"; <a href="Nikhat%20Kazmi">Nikhat Kazmi</a> from "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" further argued that Vidya was successful in lending a "rare dignity to the image of the Bollywood mom." Her portrayal garnered her several awards, including a Filmfare Award for Best Actress and a <a href="Screen%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Screen Award for Best Actress</a>.

Vidya followed the success of "Paa" with the <a href="Vishal%20Bhardwaj">Vishal Bhardwaj</a>-produced "<a href="Ishqiya">Ishqiya</a>" (2010), a <a href="black%20comedy">black comedy</a> directed by debutant <a href="Abhishek%20Chaubey">Abhishek Chaubey</a>; co-starring <a href="Naseeruddin%20Shah">Naseeruddin Shah</a>, <a href="Arshad%20Warsi">Arshad Warsi</a>, and <a href="Salman%20Shahid">Salman Shahid</a>. Vidya's role was that of the sexually manipulative Krishna Verma. Vidya described her character as "an epitome of grey" and a departure from the conventional portrayal of women in cinema. In preparation for her part, she undertook professional training to speak in the local <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>-dialect. The feature as well as her performance received critical acclaim. <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> of <a href="NDTV">NDTV</a> stated, "Vidya Balan's smoldering looks scorch the screen even as her eyes hint at tragedy. She proves that she is miles ahead of the cookie cutter Barbie dolls that clutter Bollywood and that sensuality has very little to do with showing skin." Her work in the film earned Vidya a <a href="Filmfare%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress</a>, a second consecutive Best Actress award at Screen and a nomination for Best Actress at Filmfare.

<a href="Raj%20Kumar%20Gupta">Raj Kumar Gupta</a>'s semi-biographical thriller "<a href="No%20One%20Killed%20Jessica">No One Killed Jessica</a>" with <a href="Rani%20Mukerji">Rani Mukerji</a> was Vidya's first release of 2011. The film, based on the <a href="Jessica%20Lal">Jessica Lal</a> murder case, saw her portray the real-life character of Sabrina Lal, Jessica's reticent sister. While preparing for the role, Vidya did not meet Lal on the insistence of Gupta as "the Sabrina [...] today is different from the Sabrina a decade ago, [when] the story begins". "No One Killed Jessica" met with contrasting reviews from critics, but Vidya's performance was particularly praised. "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" remarked on Vidya's ability to be "in sublime control over her emotions" and Savera Someshwar of Rediff.com added that "her hesitant body language, her faith, her helplessness, her rage, her sorrow and her gratitude all come across beautifully". The film had earnings of and was noted for being a commercial success despite the absence of a male lead. Vidya earned another Filmfare nomination in the Best Actress category for the film. In March 2011, a retrospective of Vidya's films was held in Australia, as part of the <a href="Bollywood%20and%20Beyond">Bollywood and Beyond</a> festival. That same year, Vidya featured in a <a href="guest%20appearance">guest appearance</a> in <a href="Santosh%20Sivan">Santosh Sivan</a>'s Malayalam language <a href="fantasy%20film">fantasy film</a> "<a href="Urumi%20%28film%29">Urumi</a>".

Vidya's next appearance was in Ekta Kapoor's production "<a href="The%20Dirty%20Picture%20%282011%20film%29">The Dirty Picture</a>", a biopic based on the life and death of the controversial Indian actress <a href="Silk%20Smitha">Silk Smitha</a>. Vidya was cast as Silk, who was—in Vidya's words—"known for her brazenness and in-your-face sexuality." She described the role as the "boldest" she had ever played, one that "required a lot of mental preparation." To look the part, she gained . The film opened to major critical acclaim, and Vidya received unanimous praise for her portrayal which several reviewers regarded as her best performance to date. Khalid Mohamed observed, "She's extraordinary: gutsy, consistently in character and unafraid of exposing her darker side. Here's the kind of complex performance which you haven't evidenced in years and years." Her director <a href="Milan%20Luthria">Milan Luthria</a> described her as the contemporary claimant of the "sex-symbol" title and compared her "voluptuousness" to the likes of yesteryear actresses <a href="Sridevi">Sridevi</a> and <a href="Vyjayanthimala">Vyjayanthimala</a>. With earnings of worldwide, "The Dirty Picture" ranks among her most successful releases. Vidya won a second Filmfare Award, a third consecutive Screen Award, and a <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">National Film Award for Best Actress</a>.

For her next feature film, Vidya starred as Vidya Bagchi, a pregnant woman in search of her missing husband in <a href="Sujoy%20Ghosh">Sujoy Ghosh</a>'s "<a href="Kahaani">Kahaani</a>" (2012). The thriller, set in the city of <a href="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> during the <a href="Durga%20Puja">Durga Puja</a> festivities, met with wide critical acclaim. To lend authenticity to her part, Vidya met several pregnant women and learnt about their lifestyle. She generated public and media attention by wearing a fake baby bump during the film's promotional activities. Vidya received further appreciation for her performance in "Kahaani". Subhash K. Jha praised Vidya's portrayal of "grace under pressure" as "measured and skilled"; Pratim D. Gupta of "<a href="The%20Telegraph%20%28Calcutta%29">The Telegraph</a>" added that she "gets into the physicality of a pregnant woman with unfailing mastery". Once again, the film proved to be a success, grossing over worldwide. Vidya won a fourth consecutive Best Actress Award at Screen and a third Best Actress Award at Filmfare.

After completing the duties of a jury member at the <a href="2013%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2013 Cannes Film Festival</a>, Vidya starred opposite <a href="Emraan%20Hashmi">Emraan Hashmi</a> as a boisterous <a href="Punjabi%20people">Punjabi woman</a> in "<a href="Ghanchakkar%20%28film%29">Ghanchakkar</a>", a comic-thriller from director Raj Kumar Gupta. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film and it earned little at the box office. Vidya then provided the voice of <a href="Draupadi">Draupadi</a> for "<a href="Mahabharat%20%282013%20film%29">Mahabharat</a>", a <a href="computer%20animation">3D animation film</a> based on the Indian epic <a href="Mahabharata">of the same name</a>.

The romantic comedy "<a href="Shaadi%20Ke%20Side%20Effects">Shaadi Ke Side Effects</a>" was Vidya's first film release of 2014. Directed by <a href="Saket%20Chaudhary">Saket Chaudhary</a> and co-starring <a href="Farhan%20Akhtar">Farhan Akhtar</a>, the film is about a married couple who face a series of comic events after the birth of their child. Critics found the film to be a "bit overstretched", but praised both Akhtar and Vidya's performances. Also that year, Vidya featured as the host of "No More Kamzor", a television special on women empowerment. She then starred in the comedy-drama "<a href="Bobby%20Jasoos">Bobby Jasoos</a>", in which she played the eponymous role of a <a href="Hyderabadi">Hyderabadi</a> woman aspiring to be a detective. Vidya was drawn to the idea of playing a detective and identified with the character's struggle to prove herself. It required her to sport twelve elaborate disguises, and she trained with a language coach to adopt a Hyderabadi accent. Saumil Gandhi of "<a href="Mumbai%20Mirror">Mumbai Mirror</a>" wrote that Vidya's "effervescence rubs off on the proceedings and gives it an energy that drives the film". However, both "Shaadi Ke Side Effects" and "Bobby Jasoos" failed to find a wide audience.

In 2015, Vidya reteamed with Hashmi in the <a href="Mohit%20Suri">Mohit Suri</a>-directed romantic drama "<a href="Hamari%20Adhuri%20Kahani">Hamari Adhuri Kahani</a>". Penned by <a href="Mahesh%20Bhatt">Mahesh Bhatt</a>, the film tells the story of Vasudha, a single mother trapped in an abusive marriage, who has an extra-marital affair. Shubha Shetty-Saha of "<a href="Mid%20Day">Mid Day</a>" commented that Vidya "has shown us what she's capable of in her earlier movies. But here, saddled with a boring, outdated, weepy character, there was nothing much even she could do". Vidya next took on the part of a police officer in "<a href="Te3n">Te3n</a>" (2016), a thriller inspired by the 2013 South Korean film "<a href="Montage%20%282013%20film%29">Montage</a>", co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and <a href="Nawazuddin%20Siddiqui">Nawazuddin Siddiqui</a>. She identified with her character's "silent aggression" and drawn to the idea of playing a character who commands respect. NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee criticised the decision to bill Vidya's pivotal role as a special appearance and noted how much her presence benefited the film. Rajeev Masand was critical of the film's predictable denouement, but wrote that Vidya "is reliably solid each time she's on screen, raising her brow, curling her lip to effectively communicate more than words can". She then portrayed the actress <a href="Geeta%20Bali">Geeta Bali</a> in multiple songs for "<a href="Ekk%20Albela">Ekk Albela</a>", a <a href="Marathi%20cinema">Marathi</a> language biopic of <a href="Bhagwan%20Dada">Bhagwan Dada</a>.

Vidya's final release of 2016 was Sujoy Ghosh's "", a sequel to "Kahaani", although it narrated a different story. The film was highly anticipated, and critics believed that Vidya's recent spate of poorly received films would come to an end. "Kahaani 2", however, was not as well-received as the first film, although Vidya received a Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her portrayal of a <a href="child%20sexual%20abuse">child sexual abuse</a> survivor in the film. Raja Sen thought that despite being an engaging thriller the film's denouement was predictable, but added that "with tremendous commitment to the part, [Vidya] gives us a stirring performance free of vanity or obviousness" and praised her "knack for winning the audience over; when she gasps, we gasp".

<a href="Srijit%20Mukherji">Srijit Mukherji</a>'s period drama "<a href="Begum%20Jaan">Begum Jaan</a>" (2017) saw Vidya play the role of the titular <a href="procuring%20%28prostitution%29">procurer</a>. A Hindi language remake of the Bengali film "<a href="Rajkahini">Rajkahini</a>" (2015), "Begum Jaan" tells the story of prostitutes who are affected by the <a href="Partition%20of%20India">partition of India in 1947</a>. In preparation, Vidya worked with Mukherji to provide a backstory to her character, and she researched the era by reading <a href="Urvashi%20Butalia">Urvashi Butalia</a>’s novel "<a href="Urvashi%20Butalia%23The%20Other%20Side%20of%20Silence">The Other Side of Silence</a>". Filming in the barren landscape of rural <a href="Jharkhand">Jharkhand</a> proved to be a challenge for Vidya, and she said that the experience taught her that "if push comes to shove, I can brave scorpions, snakes and whatever else". <a href="Anna%20M.%20M.%20Vetticad">Anna M. M. Vetticad</a> of "<a href="Firstpost">Firstpost</a>" disliked the film and blamed the writing for Vidya's inability to "dig deep and summon up a relatable human being".

Later in 2017, Vidya played Sulu, a spirited housewife who moonlights as a relationship advice talk show host, in the comedy-drama "<a href="Tumhari%20Sulu">Tumhari Sulu</a>". She identified with her character's enthusiastic personality and was challenged by the opportunity to play a rare comic part. She drew on her experience of playing a radio jockey in "Lage Raho Munna Bhai" and listened to late-night talk shows. Writing for "The Times of India", Neil Soans commended Vidya for "infusing Sulu with an abundance of infectious optimism without being aggravating", and Shubhra Gupta of "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">The Indian Express</a>" took note of how well she channeled "her distinctive voice and full-bellied laughter to invest Sulu with real warmth". With earnings of over on a budget, "Tumhari Sulu" proved to be Vidya's first commercial success since "Kahaani". NDTV listed her performance as the best by a Hindi film actress that year, and she won her fifth Screen Award and fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actress.

Following a year-long absence, Vidya returned to the screen in 2019 to play Basavatarakam, the first wife of actor, filmmaker and politician <a href="N.%20T.%20Rama%20Rao">N. T. Rama Rao</a> (played by <a href="Nandamuri%20Balakrishna">Nandamuri Balakrishna</a>) in a two-part Telugu-language biopic directed by <a href="Krish%20%28director%29">Krish</a>, titled "" and "".. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of "The Hindu" found Vidya to be a "treat to watch", adding that "her quietude and eyes [...] speak a thousand words contrasting NTR’s histrionics". Writing for "Firstpost", Hemanth Kumar opined that "there's something soothing about her mere presence that makes you want to respect her instantly". Both films failed to perform well commercially.

Vidya will next star alongside an ensemble cast, including Akshay Kumar and <a href="Taapsee%20Pannu">Taapsee Pannu</a>, in "<a href="Mission%20Mangal">Mission Mangal</a>", a retelling of the <a href="Mars%20Orbiter%20Mission">Mars Orbiter Mission</a> (which marked India's first interplanetary expedition), and in "<a href="Nerkonda%20Parvai">Nerkonda Parvai</a>", a Tamil-language remake of the courtroom drama "<a href="Pink%20%282016%20film%29">Pink</a>" (2016), starring <a href="Ajith%20Kumar">Ajith Kumar</a>. She has also committed to produce and star as <a href="Indira%20Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> in a yet-untitled web series based on <a href="Sagarika%20Ghose">Sagarika Ghose</a>'s biography "Indira – India's Most Powerful Prime Minister".

The mass media has often speculated about a romantic relationship between Vidya and her co-actors, but she has strongly denied these reports. In 2009, Vidya was involved in a controversy when she mentioned a previous relationship in which "caustic remarks" were made at her due to her weight. She said, "If someone who matters to you takes you down, it can break you. That someone whose approval mattered to me started to constantly find faults with me. At that point of time, it was important to walk away from that relationship." Though she refused to name the person, <a href="tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> reports suggested that she was referring to Shahid Kapoor (her co-star in "Kismat Konnection"). Kapoor, however, denied the allegations. During an interview in May 2012, Vidya announced that she was dating <a href="Siddharth%20Roy%20Kapur">Siddharth Roy Kapur</a>, the CEO of <a href="UTV%20Motion%20Pictures">UTV Motion Pictures</a>. On 14 December 2012, the couple were married in a private ceremony in <a href="Bandra">Bandra</a>, Mumbai.

Vidya is trained in <a href="Carnatic%20music">Carnatic music</a> and briefly studied the dance forms of <a href="Bharatnatyam">Bharatnatyam</a> and <a href="Kathak">Kathak</a>. Regarding her religious affiliations, Vidya said, "I am a person with a lot of faith and I have conversations [with God] all the time but I am not so religious in the conventional, organised sense". She practices vegetarianism and was listed as "India's hottest vegetarian" in polls conducted by <a href="PETA">PETA</a> in 2011 and 2012. Her weight fluctuations over the years have been the subject of substantial media coverage in India.

Besides acting in film, Vidya promotes humanitarian causes and supports charitable institutions. In March 2011, she endorsed <a href="World%20Wildlife%20Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a>'s <a href="Earth%20Hour">Earth Hour</a> campaign in India. She campaigned for the cause of nutrition in India for <a href="Child%20In%20Need%20Institute">Child In Need Institute</a> (CINI), a non-profit organisation based in Kolkata. In September 2012, Vidya visited a village in <a href="Mirzapur">Mirzapur</a>, Uttar Pradesh, where she participated in a campaign to promote children's education and the empowerment of women. For her attempts to empower women, Vidya was awarded The <a href="Prabha%20Khaitan">Prabha Khaitan</a> Puraskar 2012 by the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce; she was the youngest recipient of the award. In August 2013, she served as the grand marshal of the <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28India%29">India Day parade</a> held in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. In September that year, she launched a technology-based learning platform for underprivileged children in the Thanapur village of Uttar Pradesh. On the occasion of <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Day">International Women's Day</a> in 2015, Vidya wrote an opinion column in "Hindustan Times" on the issues faced by women in India. In August 2017, Vidya was made a member of the Indian <a href="Central%20Board%20of%20Film%20Certification">Central Board of Film Certification</a>, to certify films for theatrical exhibition. The following year, she became the goodwill ambassador of Arpan, an NGO that creates awareness on sexual abuse.

Following the success of "Parineeta" and "Lage Raho Munna Bhai", Vidya's film roles were subject to wide critical analysis. <a href="Vir%20Sanghvi">Vir Sanghvi</a> noted that the films "Heyy Babyy" and "Kismat Konnection" were "strange films [...] in which she tried to pretend to be what she is not — a Bollywood bimbette." Vidya described that particular phase in her career as a "struggle to be someone else". Due to the criticism that her film choices evoked, Vidya decided to choose roles that she "believed in" rather than choose by convention. Members of the media have subsequently labelled her as "bold" and "daring" in her choices.

Her starring roles in "Heyy Babyy" and "Kismat Konnection" also led to considerable attention in the media for her "questionable wardrobe". Several publications listed her as the "worst dressed actress" and her costume designers attributed her failure to carry off western clothes due to her weight and body structure. She was later praised in the media for wearing <a href="sari">sari</a>s at public events; designer <a href="Niharika%20Khan">Niharika Khan</a> explained, "Vidya's beauty lies in her curves. She's comfortable in her voluptuousness, and therefore in a sari." Vidya has since been identified as defying "an anglicised idea of sexuality" and embody the idea of "raw Indian sexuality".

After portraying strong protagonists in "Paa", "Ishqiya", "No One Killed Jessica", "The Dirty Picture" and "Kahaani", Vidya was credited in the media for pioneering a movement that breaks the stereotypical portrayal of heroines in Bollywood. The major commercial success of the latter two earned her the title of a "female hero" and Kalpana Nair of "<a href="Firstpost">Firstpost</a>" noted that with these two films Vidya spearheaded a change in the roles that were offered to actresses over 30. Critic <a href="Mayank%20Shekhar">Mayank Shekhar</a> predicted, "Just a few smart male actors can completely change the face of a commercial, star-driven film industry. Looking at [...] Vidya Balan [...] it appears, that change could well originate from the leading lady instead." 

"<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>" featured Vidya in their 2012 listing of the nation's most powerful women and noted that "she has toppled the all dominating hero, reducing him to a supporting role in a male dominated film industry". Vidya was featured by "<a href="Forbes%20India">Forbes India</a>" in their annual <a href="Forbes%20Celebrity%20100">Celebrity 100</a> list in 2012 and 2013. She occupied the top slot in Rediff.com's annual listing of the year's best performances for two consecutive years (2010–11). She also featured in the list for the years 2005, 2006, 2009, 2012, and 2016. In 2012, the magazine "<a href="Verve%20%28Indian%20magazine%29">Verve</a>" featured her as one of India's "Young Power Women" and wrote, "In a reel world peopled by <a href="size%20zero">size zero</a>-toned bodies and pretty-as-a-picture heroines, Vidya comes across as completely real and natural – a woman who has followed her own instincts and dared to live her destiny by being her own person and not morphing herself to fit into any conventional slot." Two years later, the magazine listed her as a power icon. In 2018, "<a href="The%20Economic%20Times">The Economic Times</a>" considered Vidya to be one of the most prominent celebrity brand ambassadors in India.

In 2014, Vidya was awarded the <a href="Padma%20Shri">Padma Shri</a>, the fourth highest civilian award in India, for her contributions to the entertainment industry. The following year, she received an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from <a href="Rai%20Foundation">Rai University</a>; the university also named a scholarship program for underprivileged girls after her. The chancellor of the university, Harbeen Arora said, "Among the league of iconic actors, Vidya is a pioneer in every way. Her films epitomise a distinct Indianness and a powerful womanhood".

Among Vidya's film awards are a <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">National Film Award for Best Actress</a> for "The Dirty Picture" (2011); and six Filmfare Awards: <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Debut">Best Female Debut</a> for "Parineeta" (2005); <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> for "Paa" (2009), "The Dirty Picture" (2011), "Kahaani" (2012), and "Tumhari Sulu" (2017); and <a href="Filmfare%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Critics Award for Best Actress</a> for "Ishqiya" (2010).

SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes

The SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes, collectively known as Light Pacifics or informally as "Spam Cans", are <a href="streamliner">air-smoothed</a> <a href="4-6-2">4-6-2 "Pacific"</a> <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>s designed for the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">Southern Railway</a> by its <a href="Chief%20Mechanical%20Engineer">Chief Mechanical Engineer</a> <a href="Oliver%20Bulleid">Oliver Bulleid</a>. Incorporating a number of new developments in British steam locomotive technology, they were amongst the first British designs to use welding in the construction process, and to use steel <a href="Firebox%20%28steam%20engine%29">firebox</a>es, which meant that components could be more easily constructed under wartime austerity and post-war economy.

They were designed to be lighter in weight than their sister locomotives, the <a href="SR%20Merchant%20Navy%20class">Merchant Navy class</a>, to permit use on a wider variety of routes, including in the south-west of England and the <a href="Kent">Kent</a> coast. They were a <a href="Mixed-traffic%20locomotive">mixed-traffic</a> design, being equally adept at hauling passenger and freight trains, and were used on all types of services, frequently far below their capabilities. A total of 110 locomotives were constructed between 1945 and 1950, named after <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a> resorts or <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) and other subjects associated with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>.

Due to problems with some of the new features, such as the <a href="Bulleid%20chain-driven%20valve%20gear">Bulleid chain-driven valve gear</a>, sixty locomotives were rebuilt by <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a>ways during the late 1950s. The results were similar to the rebuilt Merchant Navy class. The classes operated until July 1967, when the last steam locomotives on the <a href="Southern%20Region%20of%20British%20Railways">Southern Region</a> were withdrawn. Although most were scrapped, twenty locomotives are preserved on <a href="heritage%20railways">heritage railways</a> in Britain.

The financial success enjoyed by the Southern Railway during the 1930s was based on the completion of its London <a href="Suburban%20rail">suburban</a> <a href="railway%20electrification">electrification</a> scheme in 1929 and the subsequent electrification of the main lines to <a href="Brighton%20Main%20Line">Brighton and the Sussex Coast</a> and to <a href="Portsmouth%20Direct%20Line">Guildford and Portsmouth</a>. Despite electrification plans, the Southern Railway's less heavily used lines in the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a> beyond <a href="Salisbury">Salisbury</a> did not merit the cost. Lines in <a href="Devon">Devon</a> and <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> were meandering, heavily graded, and although with heavy summer holiday traffic were lightly used during the winter months. The seasonality of railway traffic meant that the West Country branches were worked by the ageing <a href="LSWR%20T9%20class">T9 class</a> <a href="4-4-0">4-4-0</a> and the versatile <a href="SECR%20N%20class">N class</a> <a href="2-6-0">2-6-0</a>, which could be better utilised on mixed-traffic services elsewhere. As a result, an order was placed with <a href="Brighton%20railway%20works">Brighton railway works</a> in April 1941 for twenty passenger locomotives of a type to be determined.

During 1943, Bulleid began planning for the post-war locomotive requirements of the railway and identified the need for a stop-gap steam locomotive design for those <a href="Main%20line%20%28railway%29">main lines</a> in South East England scheduled for electrification, had the Second World War not taken place. Although the new <a href="SR%20Merchant%20Navy%20class">Merchant Navy class</a> was available for the heaviest Continental expresses, the resumption of frequent passenger services over poorly maintained infrastructure, following the war, would require a lighter locomotive with wider <a href="route%20availability">route availability</a>.

At the same time, there would be a continuing need for fast <a href="freight">freight</a> locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban electrification used <a href="electric%20multiple%20units">electric multiple units</a>, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%2070%20%28electric%29">prototype electric</a> locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.

The detailed design work for the new mixed-traffic locomotives was undertaken at <a href="Brighton%20railway%20works">Brighton railway works</a> where they were scheduled to be constructed. The earliest drawings were for a moderately sized <a href="2-6-0">2-6-0</a> with similarities to the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> <a href="LNER%20Class%20K4">K4 class</a>, which Bulleid had helped design for the <a href="West%20Highland%20Line">West Highland Line</a> when he was <a href="Nigel%20Gresley">Nigel Gresley</a>'s assistant. However, such a design would have been inadequate for the Kent Coast lines, which required a powerful <a href="2-6-2">2-6-2</a> or <a href="4-6-0">4-6-0</a> class. It is not clear why the design was subsequently enlarged to become a smaller version of the Merchant Navy class <a href="4-6-2">4-6-2</a> as the likely traffic requirement did not warrant such lavish provision, but the incorporation of components from that class enabled standardisation during wartime production difficulties.

In order to improve on the route availability of the Merchant Navy class with its 21-ton axle loading, the weight was reduced by 5 tons. This allowed the design to operate on routes where the Maunsell 2-6-0s were the largest permitted and came mainly from several changes:
Also the cab was reduced in width and remodelled to comply with reduced loading gauge over some routes.

Based on the mechanical experience gained from the Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his <a href="Bulleid%20chain-driven%20valve%20gear">chain-driven valve gear</a> into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because it was difficult to access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid <a href="steam%20reverser">steam reverser</a>, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.

The locomotive also carried a similar "air-smoothed" casing to the Merchant Navy class. This was not regarded as streamlining by Bulleid, a fact demonstrated by the flat front end. Authorities differ as to the purpose of the casing. According to Creer it was intended to be an aid in cleaning the locomotive with carriage washers to reduce labour requirements during the post-war period, whereas Bradley asserts that the intention was to lift the steam and <a href="exhaust%20gas">exhaust gas</a>es away from the cab. As with the Merchant Navies, the class soon gained the nickname "Spam Cans", due to the resemblance to the distinctive <a href="tin%20can">tin can</a>s in which "<a href="Spam%20%28food%29">SPAM</a>" was sold.

The <a href="smokebox">smokebox</a> was an integral part of the air-smoothed casing, being a sheet metal fabrication to the same profile as the firebox that acted as a former to maintain the shape of the casing. In between, the casing was supported by channel-section steel <a href="crinoline">crinoline</a>s (strengtheners used to maintain the shape) attached to the frames. The smokebox housed the five-nozzle <a href="Jean%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Lemaître</a> <a href="blastpipe">blastpipe</a> arranged in a circle within a large-diameter chimney.

As with the Merchant Navy class, <a href="electric">electric</a> lighting was provided on both locomotive and <a href="footplate">footplate</a>, powered by a steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by <a href="ultra-violet%20light">ultra-violet light</a>. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, making it easier for the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the <a href="ergonomics">ergonomics</a> of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the <a href="Fireman%20%28locomotive%29">fireman</a>, a treadle used steam <a href="pressure">pressure</a> to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the <a href="firebox%20%28steam%20engine%29">firebox</a>. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) <a href="Bulleid%20Firth%20Brown">Bulleid Firth Brown</a> (BFB) wheels.

Compared with the Merchant Navy class, shorter overall length led to shorter <a href="Steam%20locomotive%23Chassis">frames</a> and reduced the wheelbase to .

The boiler was also shorter and of smaller diameter at the smokebox end, but retaining the operating pressure.

The inner and outer <a href="Belpaire%20firebox">Belpaire firebox</a> was also smaller than the Merchant Navy class also constructed using welded steel.

The cylinders were smaller at .

Bulleid designed a reduced capacity <a href="tender%20locomotive">tender</a> based upon the Merchant Navy version. It could carry water and of coal on a six-wheel underframe. It retained the BFB wheels and <a href="streamliner">streamlining panels</a>, or "raves", that gave the top of the tender a similar cross-sectional outline to <a href="carriages">carriages</a>. As with the Merchant Navy class, the water tank was of welded sheet construction to save weight, and the tender was fitted with vacuum braking equipment of a clasp-type similar to that on the locomotive. Four train-brake vacuum reservoirs of cylindrical construction were grouped on the tank top, behind the coal space.

The first batch of twenty locomotives was ordered in April 1941, although the changes in design to the "Light Pacific" arrangement meant that production was delayed until late 1944. Due to wartime contract work at Brighton works, the boilers were built under contract at the <a href="North%20British%20Locomotive%20Company">North British Locomotive Company</a>. Before the first of the class had been delivered, the order was increased to thirty, with a second batch of ten ordered in September 1944. Deliveries from Brighton works began in May 1945 with prototype No. 21C101 "Exeter", and proceeded at the rate of about two locomotives per month. The class was gradually run in on the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Operations">Central Section</a> until October 1945, when they were successfully trialled on <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> and Kentish services. By the time the first fifteen had entered traffic a further order of fifteen was placed, with these entering service between June and October 1946. From this batch onwards, traction was improved by the addition of steam sanding to the front driving wheel, with covers added to protect the motion from sand falling from the filler pipes.

A third batch of twenty-five was ordered and designated the "Battle of Britain" class. These were identical to the "West Country" class and the new designation was purely concerned with giving the locomotives names that befitted their intended allocation to the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Operations">Eastern Section</a>. By the time of the <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> of <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a>ways in January 1948, seventy "Light Pacifics" had been built at <a href="Brighton%20railway%20works">Brighton Works</a>, with a fourth batch of twenty on order. There was a delay in production during the first three months of <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a>ways control but the last twenty ordered by the Southern Railway entered traffic between April 1948 and February 1949.

In March 1949, British Railways ordered a final 20 from Brighton works despite a pressing need for smaller tank locomotives. This imbalance was rectified by building forty-one examples of the <a href="LMS%20Fairburn%202-6-4T">LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T</a> for the <a href="Southern%20Region%20of%20British%20Railways">Southern Region</a>. Also at this time Brighton works staff were embroiled in the difficulties associated with Bulleid's experimental and problematic <a href="SR%20Leader%20class">Leader class</a>. As a result, Brighton sought assistance from the other Southern Region works to complete this final order. <a href="Ashford%20railway%20works">Ashford works</a> cut the frames and constructed the tenders, and <a href="Eastleigh%20railway%20works">Eastleigh works</a> constructed six of the final batch of locomotives.
The completion of the final locomotive, No. 34110 "66 Squadron", in January 1951 was delayed for several months pending consideration of proposals from British Railways management for a major modification to a standard <a href="Cylinder%20%28locomotive%29">two-cylinder</a> design without the chain-driven valve gear., but the locomotive entered service as Bulleid intended.

The first six locomotives were initially fitted with plywood sheeting over the cab-side windows as a wartime material-saving measure, with No. 21C107 "Wadebridge" the first to receive glass windows. Two of the front route indicator irons (of which there are five) were originally located on the smoke deflectors, which meant that the indicator discs stood proud of the casing. This necessitated a trial relocation to the smokebox door at the three and nine o'clock positions on No. 21C109 "Lyme Regis", and fitted as standard from No. 21C118 "Axminster" onwards. The batch constructed between June and October 1946 received a modified <a href="Steam%20locomotive%20components">steam regulator</a> and <a href="London%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway">LMS-style</a> parallel <a href="Buffer%20%28rail%20transport%29">buffer casings</a>.

As with the Merchant Navy class, they were fitted with a new design of cab front <a href="spectacle%20plate">spectacle plate</a>s from mid–1947 due to poor forward visibility. The small <a href="window">window</a>s on the front face of the cab were redesigned to an angled profile, giving improved visibility to the driver. This was a feature fitted to all Bulleid-designed locomotives post-nationalisation. They were introduced in Britain in 1934 with the <a href="Nigel%20Gresley">Gresley</a>-designed "<a href="LNER%20Class%20P2">Cock o' the North</a>". Over the next decade the revised design was fitted to existing members of the class. Another modification was the reduction of boiler pressure to to reduce maintenance costs.

The Southern Railway-built batches had a narrow footplate due to the width-restricted <a href="Hastings%20Line">Hastings Line</a> between <a href="Tonbridge%20railway%20station">Tonbridge</a> and <a href="Hastings%20railway%20station">Hastings</a> but these were never used on this duty and the cab was widened to on the British Railways batch. The tenders of Nos. 21C166–21C170 were fitted with <a href="TIA%20%28water%20treatment%29">TIA</a> ("Traitement Integral Armand") chemical feed-water equipment that precipitated scale-forming constituents in the hard water of southern England into a non-adhesive mud that could be cleared using a manual "blow-down" valve. This equipment was retrospectively fitted to earlier members of the class. In 1948 the <a href="tender%20locomotive">tender</a> design was enlarged to provide a water capacity of .

To ease maintenance and lubrication, panels of air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders were removed from 1952, and the front sanders were blanked off. This coincided with the removal of the tender "raves" on all but five locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing. The resultant "cut-down" tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.

When the rebuilding programme (see below) was halted in 1961, further modifications were made to the unrebuilt locomotives. The most notable was on No. 34064 "Fighter Command", which was fitted with a <a href="Giesl%20ejector">Giesl ejector</a> in 1962 on the grounds that a desired spark arrestor would "suffocate" an ordinary blastpipe. Following some adjustment, the ejector improved smoke deflection and fuel consumption, allowing it to steam well with low-grade coal. As a consequence of the positive experience with No. 34064, preserved No. 34092 "City of Wells" was similarly fitted in the mid-1980s.

Bulleid employed the same idiosyncratic numbering scheme that he had used for the Merchant Navy class, beginning at No. 21C101 and reaching No. 21C170 at the time of nationalisation. His scheme was abolished by British Railways, which renumbered existing these 34001-34070 and new locomotives 34071-34110.
The first 48 members of the class were named after places in the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a> served by its trains or close to its lines. This represented a publicity success due to many of the locomotives being able to visit their namesake areas. Many 'West Country' locomotives sported an additional plaque with the <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> of the town or region the locomotive was named after. This plaque was mounted on the casing between the <a href="gunmetal">gunmetal</a> locomotive nameplate and the "West Country Class" scroll, above the middle driving wheel. Several members of the class had only the nameplate and the "West Country Class" scroll, a gap being left where a crest would have been mounted. The background of the nameplate was usually painted red, though sometimes examples could be found in black if the locomotive works undertaking overhaul of the engine could not locate the correct colour paint.
Once it became clear that the locomotives would be used further afield than the West Country, a decision was made to name the remainder after RAF squadrons, airfields, commanders and aircraft that had participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a> over <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> and <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>. 'Battle of Britain' nameplates incorporated the name of the locomotive with the class name below, in a design that resembled the <a href="wing">wing</a>s of an <a href="aircraft">aircraft</a>. This was painted <a href="Air%20Force%20blue">Air Force blue</a>, though other colours were sometimes substituted for the same reasons as above. An enamelled crest of the aircraft, personality or squadron was placed below the nameplate, in the same position as the West Country class equivalent.

The first locomotives constructed by British Railways were of the Battle of Britain class, but the naming policy reverted to the West Country for Nos. 34091–34108. The final two locomotives were Battle of Britain class, No. 34109 "Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory" and No. 34110 "66 Squadron". The result of the delay in completing was that the squadron crest for "66 Squadron" was never made, as the manufacturer had retired during the intervening period. Thus "66 Squadron" was the only Battle of Britain class member not to have a crest.

The original intention was to base the first batch of locomotives at <a href="Exmouth%20Junction">Exmouth Junction</a> depot at <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a> for use on the <a href="West%20of%20England%20Main%20Line">West of England Main Line</a> to <a href="Salisbury">Salisbury</a> and <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, and secondary lines to <a href="Tarka%20Line">Barnstaple</a>, <a href="Okehampton%20to%20Bude%20Line">Bude</a> and other holiday resorts in Devon and Cornwall. By the winter of 1945, there was a more pressing need for them on Kent Coast services. The class also began to be used on Continental Boat Trains to and from <a href="Dover">Dover</a> and <a href="Folkestone">Folkestone</a> once these were resumed in 1946. Later batches were used on cross-country services such as the <a href="West%20Coastway%20Line">Brighton to Bournemouth, Cardiff and Plymouth</a> trains or the <a href="Somerset%20and%20Dorset%20Joint%20Railway">Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway</a> trains from <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> to <a href="Wells%2C%20Somerset">Wells</a> and <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>.

Because of the good route availability the locomotives could be used on non-electrified lines between London and <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>. These included the <a href="Oxted%20Line">Oxted Line</a>, and occasionally the Bluebell Line between <a href="East%20Grinstead">East Grinstead</a> and <a href="Lewes">Lewes</a>, where they were also used for freight and parcels traffic, and excursion trains over electrified lines. Thus the original intention for the West Country class locomotives to work in <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a> and the Battle of Britain class in Kent, <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a> and <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> was never operationally practical and both classes were to be found all over the network. The most important journey undertaken by a member of the class occurred on 30 January 1965, when No.34051 "Winston Churchill" hauled the funeral train of its <a href="Winston%20Churchill">namesake</a> from <a href="London%20Waterloo%20railway%20station">Waterloo station</a> to his final resting place, close to <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim Palace</a> in <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>.

As with the Merchant Navy class, they could generate great power using mediocre quality fuel, due largely to Bulleid's excellent boiler. They also ran smoothly at high speed, but they were also beset with the same technical problems of their larger sisters. These may be summarised as follows:


Restricted driver visibility was mentioned in the report on the disastrous <a href="Lewisham%20rail%20crash">Lewisham rail crash</a> on 4 December 1957 outside St John's railway station, in which 90 people were killed and 173 injured. The driver of No. 34066 "Spitfire" had failed to see one yellow and one double-yellow "caution" signal in foggy conditions and was travelling too fast to stop when he saw a red signal, and the train crashed into the back of a stationary local train. Members of the class were later fitted with <a href="Automatic%20Warning%20System">Automatic Warning System</a> equipment, a recommendation of the incident report; fitting of trackside equipment was already underway, but priority had been given to routes equipped with semaphore signals, not electric "colour-light" signals as at Lewisham.

The report on the disaster indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right-hand side of the train and because of the limited visibility from the left-hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left-hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards of visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a <a href="SR%20V%20Schools%20class">Schools</a> class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could have been seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.

Due to the problems experienced with the class, and following the success of the rebuilt Merchant Navy class designed by <a href="R.%20G.%20Jarvis">R. G. Jarvis</a>, British Railways ordered the rebuilding of sixty locomotives to a more conventional design at Eastleigh between 1957 and 1961. The first locomotive to be rebuilt was No. 34005 "Barnstaple", which adopted many features from the <a href="Steam%20locomotives%20of%20British%20Railways%23BR%20standard%20classes">BR 'Standard' locomotive classes</a>. The casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, boiler pressure reduced to and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with modified <a href="Walschaerts%20valve%20gear">Walschaerts valve gear</a> fitted both outside as well as between the frames. The rapid onset of the <a href="1955%20Modernisation%20Plan">1955 Modernisation Plan</a> during the early 1960s meant that the remaining fifty locomotives were not rebuilt, and continued in as-built condition until withdrawal.

The rebuilding solved most of the maintenance problems whilst retaining the excellent features of the original design. Repair costs were reduced by up to 60%, and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8.4%. However the Walschaerts valve gear made the rebuilds heavier and prone to <a href="hammerblow%20%28railway%29">hammerblow</a> on the track, a complaint that was not evident with the original design. The increased weight reduced their <a href="route%20availability">route availability</a>, meaning that they could not be used on certain routes available to un-rebuilt examples, such as the line to <a href="Ilfracombe%20Branch%20Line">Ilfracombe</a>.

The electrification of the <a href="Chatham%20Main%20Line">Chatham Main Line</a> to <a href="Dover">Dover</a> and <a href="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> in 1959 deprived the class of some of its work, as did the transfer of the lines west of <a href="Salisbury">Salisbury</a> to the Western Region on 30 December 1962. This resulted in the withdrawal of several unrebuilt locomotives stabled at <a href="Exmouth%20Junction">Exmouth Junction</a> shed in June 1963. By the end of the year ten had been withdrawn, including the 12‑year-old No. 34110 "66 Squadron", having travelled only 600,000 miles. Most of the unrebuilt locomotives were withdrawn over the next three years but seven survived until 1967 and the <a href="Steam%20locomotive%23The%20end%20of%20steam%20in%20general%20use">end of steam</a> on the Southern Region. Many rebuilt locomotives were withdrawn soon after their rebuilding. The first was No. 34028 "Eddystone" in May 1964, having run only 287,000 miles since rebuilding. Other early withdrawals included No. 34109 "Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory" which had only travelled 162,000 miles in the three and a half years since its rebuilding. 

Twenty "Light Pacifics" still exist, in varying states of preservation: two were purchased directly from BR for preservation, 34023 "Blackmoor Vale" & 34051 "Winston Churchill"; the other eighteen being purchased from Barry Scrapyard. Of these twenty class members to survive, ten are in original form, whilst ten are in "rebuilt" form. Had it not been for <a href="Woodham%20Brothers">Woodham Brothers</a>' <a href="scrapyard">scrapyard</a> in <a href="Barry%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan">Barry, South Wales</a>, no rebuilt "Light Pacifics" would have been preserved. Eleven of the surviving engines are named after West Country locations in the South of England and the remaining nine after RAF Squadrons or significant persons, including Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. All but one of the class in preservation were built at <a href="Brighton%20railway%20works">Brighton Works</a>, the exception being 34101 "Hartland" which was built at <a href="Eastleigh%20Works">Eastleigh Works</a>. The class has proved to be useful for preservation societies, due to its good route availability and ample power, with some having returned to the main line to haul special trains. It is uncertain whether all of the preserved locomotives will be restored to working order; owing to the very poor condition some of them were in when purchased and the increasing cost of materials.

Other relics of both classes that have survived are nameplates, which were removed towards the end of steam on the <a href="Southern%20Region%20of%20British%20Railways">British Railways Southern Region</a> in the 1960s. As a result, many exist in private collections, and several have been seen at auction, selling for several thousands of pounds.

Just four members of the class are yet to run in preservation: 34010 "Sidmouth", which is awaiting restoration from scrapyard condition (its boiler is stored at <a href="Severn%20Valley%20Railway">Bridgnorth</a>); 34051 "Winston Churchill", which is on static display at the National Railway Museum in York; 34058 "Sir Frederick Pile", which is under restoration at the <a href="Watercress%20Line">Mid Hants Railway</a>; and 34073 "249 Squadron", which is awaiting restoration at <a href="Carnforth%20MPD">Carnforth MPD</a>. Of the sixteen engines which have operated in preservation, six have operated on the main line: 34016 "Bodmin", 34027 "Taw Valley", 34046 "Braunton", 34067 "Tangmere", 34072 "257 Squadron" & 34092 "City of Wells". 34046 is the only member of the class operating currently that has a valid main line certificate. 34028 "Eddystone" and 34070 "Manston" did briefly return to the mainline in 2009 to attend an event at Eastleigh, but the two engines were towed behind a diesel as neither was mainline certified. .

Livery was Southern Railway <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Livery%20and%20numbering%20system">malachite green</a> with "Sunshine yellow" horizontal lining. A circular cast brass plate with a red background on the smokebox door featured the word "Southern" and the date of manufacture. Bulleid advocated a continental style of numbering, basing this upon his experiences at the French branch of <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric">Westinghouse Electric</a> before the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, and his tenure in the <a href="Railway%20Operating%20Division">Railway Operating Division</a> (R.O.D.) during that conflict. The Southern Railway number adapted the <a href="UIC%20classification">UIC classification</a> system where "2" and "1" refer to the number of un-powered leading and trailing axles respectively, and "C" refers to the number of driving axles, in this case three. However, since "21C" was the prefix already used by the Merchant Navy class, the suffix "1" was added; these locomotives carried numbers that started "21C1" followed by the individual two-digit identifier.

Initial livery after nationalisation in 1948 was <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a>ways malachite green and "Sunshine yellow" lining and lettering, with British Railways on the tender. No. 34090 "Sir Eustace Missenden, Southern Railway" was given commemorative malachite green livery that included green-painted wheels with yellow rims and the early British Railways crest on the tender. The Bulleid numbering system was temporarily retained on the first seventy locomotives with the addition of an "s" prefix (e.g. s21C101). The classes were given several <a href="power%20classification">power classification</a>s in their careers, beginning with 6MT (Mixed Traffic) in 1949. In December 1953 they were reclassified 7P 5FA, the "A" denoting brake power when used on unfitted (non-vacuum braked) goods trains. The rebuilt locomotives retained this classification until all received the classification of 7P6F between November 1957 and November 1961.

The locomotives were turned out in British Railways <a href="Brunswick%20green">Brunswick green</a> livery with orange and black lining with the British Railways crest on the tender side, after their first <a href="wikt%3Aoverhaul">overhaul</a> under new ownership. This was unlike the Merchant Navy class, which was initially turned out in British Railways experimental express passenger blue livery. By this stage, the Southern Railway-built locomotives were re-liveried and renumbered from 34001–34070. The rebuilt locomotives were also in British Railways Brunswick green with orange and black lining, and crest on the tender side, whilst the nameplates were placed on a custom-made mounting on the running plate due to the absence of a flat surface.

Some of the locomotives had additional embellishments. No. 34050 "Royal Observer Corps" was presented with an ROC long-service medal in July 1961. The ceremony took place at <a href="London%20Waterloo%20railway%20station">Waterloo station</a>, and included <a href="Commandant%20Royal%20Observer%20Corps">Commandant ROC</a> Air Commodore <a href="Cathcart%20Wight-Boycott">Wight-Boycott</a>. The cab side was given a representation of the medal and its ribbon, which was displayed until the engine was withdrawn from service and scrapped in the late 1960s. The original nameplate and crest were recovered and displayed in the entrance hall of ROC Headquarters at <a href="RAF%20Bentley%20Priory">RAF Bentley Priory</a> until 1996 when they were transferred to the RAF Museum at <a href="Hendon">Hendon</a>. Another locomotive that featured a second crest was 34067 "Tangmere", which was given the airfield's crest for the cab side, as it did not feature on the nameplate crest.

The class in both unrebuilt and rebuilt forms has been the subject of divergent opinions. The use of welded steel construction and the various innovations that had not previously been seen in British locomotive design meant that the class earned Bulleid the title "Last Giant of Steam". The steam-raising ability of their boilers represented an advance in British steam technology. Their light axle-loading also meant widespread use over the Southern network, and they were capable of fast running.

Despite these successes, the number of innovations introduced at the same time made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. A great deal of money was wasted on resolving the problems of a class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper <a href="2-6-2">2-6-2</a> or <a href="4-6-0">4-6-0</a> mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more "Light Pacifics" were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a> during the winter months was a "Light Pacific" hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as <a href="Padstow">Padstow</a> and <a href="Wadebridge">Wadebridge</a>. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when <a href="dieselisation">dieselisation</a> and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.

<a href="Kitmaster">Kitmaster</a> produced an unpowered polystyrene injection-moulded kit for <a href="00%20gauge">00 gauge</a> from 1960. In late 1962, the brand was sold to <a href="Airfix">Airfix</a>, which resumed production in 1968. The moulds later passed to <a href="Dapol">Dapol</a>, which continues to produce the kit. <a href="Hornby%20Railways">Hornby</a> manufactures ready-to-run rebuilt and un-rebuilt examples of the class and caters for all the major detail variations. <a href="Graham%20Farish">Graham Farish</a> produces ready-to-run models in <a href="N%20gauge">N gauge</a>, and Dapol has announced its intention to produce models in N gauge, slated for release in May 2012. Hornby Dublo produced diecast metal "rebuilt" West Countries in the 1960s, and those became Triang-Wrenn, and ultimately Wrenn Railways. Wrenn produced air-smoothed versions and rebuilt versions, right through to their demise (and subsequent sale to Dapol) in the early 1990s.

M-35 (Michigan highway)

M-35 is a <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> in the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a> (UP) of the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. It runs for in a general north–south direction and connects the cities of <a href="Menominee%2C%20Michigan">Menominee</a>, <a href="Escanaba%2C%20Michigan">Escanaba</a>, and <a href="Negaunee%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee</a>. The southern section of M-35 in <a href="Menominee%20County%2C%20Michigan">Menominee</a> and <a href="Delta%20County%2C%20Michigan">Delta</a> counties carries two additional designations; M-35 forms a segment of the <a href="Lake%20Michigan%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Michigan Circle Tour</a>, and it is the UP Hidden Coast Recreational Heritage Trail, which is a part of what is now called the <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byways">Pure Michigan Byways</a> Program. Along the southern section, the highway is the closest trunkline to the <a href="Green%20Bay%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">Green Bay</a>, a section of <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>. The northern section of the highway turns inland through sylvan areas of the UP, connecting rural portions of Delta and <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a> counties.

M-35 is an original state trunkline that was first signposted in 1919, that was intended to run from Menominee in the south to near <a href="Big%20Bay%2C%20Michigan">Big Bay</a> in the north, before it was to turn toward <a href="L%27Anse%2C%20Michigan">L'Anse</a> to end at <a href="Ontonagon%2C%20Michigan">Ontonagon</a>. However, the section through the <a href="Huron%20Mountains">Huron Mountains</a> in northern Marquette and <a href="Baraga%20County%2C%20Michigan">Baraga</a> counties was never built. Automobile pioneer <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a> helped halt this construction to gain favor with and membership into the exclusive <a href="Huron%20Mountain%20Club">Huron Mountain Club</a>. Some discontinuous sections were later ceded to local control. The northern segment of the route between Ontonagon and <a href="Baraga%2C%20Michigan">Baraga</a> was retained as a discontinuous segment of the highway; this northern segment was later redesignated as <a href="M-38%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">another state trunkline</a>. The northern end was later rerouted out of the City of Negaunee into <a href="Negaunee%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee Township</a> to avoid mining activity near <a href="Palmer%2C%20Michigan">Palmer</a>.

M-35 is primarily a two-lane roadway, with the exception of the nearly section between <a href="Escanaba%2C%20Michigan">Escanaba</a> and <a href="Gladstone%2C%20Michigan">Gladstone</a>; this section is a four-lane <a href="divided%20highway">divided highway</a> that <a href="Concurrency%20%28road%29">runs concurrently</a> with <a href="U.S%20Route%202%20%28Michigan%29">US Highway 2</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20%28Michigan%29">US Highway 41</a> (US 2/US 41). M-35 is also listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a> along the US 2/US 41 concurrency. The southern terminus is in <a href="Menominee%2C%20Michigan">Menominee</a>. From there, M-35 runs northeasterly to the Escanaba area before turning northwesterly to its northern terminus outside of <a href="Negaunee%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee</a> in <a href="Negaunee%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee Township</a>.

The southern terminus of M-35 is at the corner of 10th Street (US 41) and North Shore Drive north of downtown Menominee. It is a Y-shaped intersection near John Henes Park. This park sits on of land, and it was donated to the City of Menominee by German-American brewer <a href="John%20O.%20Henes">John O. Henes</a> in 1907. M-35 leads northeast from the intersection before turning north to head out of town. The highway runs northeasterly following the shoreline of the <a href="Green%20Bay%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">Green Bay</a>, toward <a href="Escanaba%2C%20Michigan">Escanaba</a>. M-35 between Menominee and Gladstone forms part of the <a href="Lake%20Michigan%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Michigan Circle Tour</a> and comprises a section of the UP Hidden Coast Michigan Recreational Heritage Route, one of the <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a>s.
At the <a href="Menominee%20County%2C%20Michigan">Menominee</a>–<a href="Delta%20County%2C%20Michigan">Delta</a> county line, M-35 passes from the <a href="Central%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">Central</a> to the <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">Eastern Time Zone</a>. After entering the south side of Escanaba, M-35 runs into town on Lake Shore Drive, passing to the south and east of the <a href="Delta%20County%20Airport">Delta County Airport</a> before turning onto Lincoln Road. Just west of downtown, US 2/US 41 join M-35 at the intersection of Ludington Street and Lincoln Road. Ludington and Lincoln form the east–west and north–south axes respectively of the Escanaba <a href="House%20numbering%23North%20America">street numbering grid</a>. From these two streets, the east–west avenues and north–south streets are numbered in a grid in the City of Escanaba. US 2/US 41 enter Escanaba from the west along Ludington Street, turning north along Lincoln Road, joining M-35. Here, M-35 joins the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, which is a road system important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

From Escanaba, M-35 runs concurrently with US 2 and US 41 to <a href="Gladstone%2C%20Michigan">Gladstone</a>, where M-35 logs its highest <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average annual daily traffic</a> (AADT) counts. The 2012 AADT figures show that an average of 14,744 vehicles use the highway per day on a segment in north Escanaba. Between the two cities, US 2/US 41/M-35 crosses the <a href="Escanaba%20River">Escanaba River</a> near the mouth just south of a paper mill. North of the Escanaba, the highway follows the shoreline of <a href="Little%20Bay%20de%20Noc">Little Bay de Noc</a> to Gladstone. M-35 separates from US 2/US 41 at an intersection with 4th Avenue North in Gladstone. This also marks the location where the National Highway System, Lake Michigan Circle Tour and Pure Michigan Byway designations end on M-35.

M-35 turns northwesterly in Gladstone through northern Delta County and southern Marquette County and crosses the <a href="Days%20River">Days River</a> in <a href="Brampton%2C%20Michigan">Brampton</a>. From <a href="Perkins%2C%20Michigan">Perkins</a> north, M-35 runs parallel to the <a href="Lake%20Superior%20and%20Ishpeming%20Railroad">Lake Superior & Ishpeming</a> rail line between the iron mines of Marquette County and Escanaba. The station of Maple Ridge was located in the community of <a href="Rock%2C%20Michigan">Rock</a> along this line. M-35 crosses into Marquette County in the unincorporated location of <a href="McFarland%2C%20Michigan">McFarland</a> and crosses the rail line before reaching the <a href="Little%20Lake%2C%20Michigan">Little Lake</a> in the community of the same name. The highway runs east–west through Little Lake to <a href="Gwinn%2C%20Michigan">Gwinn</a>.

Built as a <a href="company%20town">company town</a> by the <a href="Cleveland-Cliffs%20Iron%20Company">Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company</a>, Gwinn is listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> as the "Gwinn <a href="Planned%20community">Model Town</a> <a href="Historic%20district%20%28United%20States%29">Historic District</a>, <a href="Forsyth%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Forsyth Township</a>, Marquette County, Michigan". M-35 follows Stephenson Avenue through the neighborhood of New Swanzy westward to the community of Gwinn. Inside Gwinn, the highway follows Pine Street northwest, passing through the downtown and into residential areas along Pine and Iron streets.

M-35 runs northwest of Gwinn to <a href="Palmer%2C%20Michigan">Palmer</a> along the outskirts of Cleveland-Cliffs' Empire Mine, where large piles of <a href="Overburden">waste rock</a> from the mining operations tower over the roadway. According to the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT), the segment through Palmer logged the highway's lowest AADT, only 487 vehicles per day, in 2012. North of Palmer, M-35 runs past <a href="Goose%20Lake%20%28Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan%29">Goose Lake</a> to end in Negaunee Township. The northern terminus is east of Negaunee, just east of the former <a href="Marquette%20County%20Airport">Marquette County Airport</a> and the studios of <a href="WLUC-TV">WLUC-TV</a> on US 41/<a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-28</a>.

The first path along part of the modern M-35 roadway was the Sault and Green Bay Trail, an old <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> trail, between <a href="Menominee%2C%20Michigan">Menominee</a> and <a href="Escanaba%2C%20Michigan">Escanaba</a>. This trail continued eastward from Escanaba to <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a> and southerly to <a href="Green%20Bay%2C%20Wisconsin">Green Bay, Wisconsin</a>. It was a narrow path of approximately in width, wide enough to permit single-file traffic. Another route, the Carp River Trail, paralleled the path of M-35 from Escanaba to the Marquette area as well. These footpaths were later used for the basis of gravel roads a century before the modern state highway system was created.

On May 13, 1913, the Legislature created the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state's highway system</a>; M-35 was not initially included. The system was signposted six year later, and M-35 was to run from <a href="M-12%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-12</a>/<a href="M-15%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-15</a> (modern US 2/US 41) at <a href="Gladstone%2C%20Michigan">Gladstone</a> in the south to <a href="Palmer%2C%20Michigan">Palmer</a> before terminating in <a href="Negaunee%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee</a> at M-15 (modern US 41). Several maps showed M-35 continuing north to L'Anse. At the time of M-35's creation, another designation, <a href="M-91%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-91</a>, was assigned to a highway from Menominee northward to <a href="Cedar%20River%2C%20Michigan">Cedar River</a>. By 1930, M-35 was extended southerly along US 2/US 41 from Gladstone to Escanaba. From there, M-35 continued as a new highway along the <a href="Green%20Bay%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">Green Bay</a> shoreline to Cedar River and supplanted M-91.

In 1919, the State Department of Highways, forerunner to today's MDOT, designated a scenic shoreline trunkline to run north from Negaunee to <a href="Skanee%2C%20Michigan">Skanee</a> and <a href="L%27Anse%2C%20Michigan">L'Anse</a> by way of <a href="Big%20Bay%2C%20Michigan">Big Bay</a>. The highway would continue from the L'Anse and <a href="Baraga%2C%20Michigan">Baraga</a> area to eventually end at <a href="Ontonagon%2C%20Michigan">Ontonagon</a> at an intersection with <a href="M-64%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-64</a>. Local Upper Peninsula historian Fred Rydholm summarized the routing planned in 1925 as extending "... in a northwesterly direction, across the <a href="Dead%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Dead River</a>, over the Panorama Hills, then west past the Elm Creek swamp, along the south side of Burnt Mountain, across the Cedar Creek, the Cliff Stream and out past Cliff Lake to Skanee and L'Anse". This highway was designated as an extension of M-35, which ended in downtown Negaunee. Work was completed on a significant portion of the route in <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette County</a> by 1926. M-35 was routed east along M-15 toward <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a> before turning north-northwesterly toward Big Bay. This section of roadway follows the modern <a href="County%20Road%20510%20%28Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan%29">County Road 510</a> (CR 510) in Marquette County. Similar work was completed in <a href="Baraga%20County%2C%20Michigan">Baraga County</a> connecting L'Anse and Skanee by 1932.

Construction on the two ends left the center portion through the <a href="Huron%20Mountains">Huron Mountains</a> unfinished and shown on state maps as a dashed line marked "impassable". One section running northwesterly from the modern CR 510 toward the <a href="Salmon%20Trout%20River">Salmon Trout River</a>, complete with guard rails and cement culverts has been called "Blind 35" since.

One of the first tasks for the State Highway Department was bridging the Dead River in Negaunee Township, north of US 41. The state solved the problem by buying a bridge in Pennsylvania, where bridges of this design were more common. MDOT describes the bridge as:
The bridge is still in place over the Dead River and previously carried CR 510 as the successor to M-35 in northern Marquette County. Known locally as "The Steel Bridge", it survived a May 15, 2003, flood caused by the breaching of the <a href="Silver%20Lake%20Dam%20%28Michigan%29">Silver Lake Dam</a>. The Marquette County Road Commission had announced plans in 2006 to bypass the Steel Bridge with a modern replacement, leaving the existing bridge as a footpath or bike path. Construction on the bypass road and replacement bridge was begun in October 2007. The concrete work for the replacement span was started in late 2009, with an original projected completion date of November 1, 2010. The new crossing is above river level compared to the for the 1921 span. The total budget for bridge construction was $4.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) with an additional $1.7 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the approach work; the project had an 80 percent federal, 15 percent state and 5 percent county funding split. The new bridge opened to traffic in September 2010, diverting traffic from the Steel Bridge. Completion of the new span came after about a decade of planning.

Records of the <a href="Huron%20Mountain%20Club">Huron Mountain Club</a>, an exclusive private organization with large land holdings in northern Michigan, show that Henry Ford visited the Upper Peninsula many times, including at least once with <a href="Harvey%20Firestone">Harvey Firestone</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a> on Ford's yacht, "Sialia". Many of these trips involved research to keep his operations supplied. His UP land provided wood for the manufacture of Ford automobiles such as the <a href="Model%20T">Model T</a>, which required of lumber per car. Ford, who was considering becoming the "owner–producer–handler" of the resources he needed, invested in <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a>s in <a href="Alberta%2C%20Michigan">Alberta</a> and <a href="Kingsford%2C%20Michigan">Kingsford</a>. He also bought the entire town of <a href="Pequaming%2C%20Michigan">Pequaming</a>, along the shores of the <a href="Keweenaw%20Bay">Keweenaw Bay</a>. The town belonged to Dan Hebard, who also sold Ford a sawmill, <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a>s, a 14-room <a href="bungalow">bungalow</a>, and land near the Huron Mountain Club. Hebard retired to spend his summers at a cabin on the Pine River on land belonging to the Club.

Ford built a <a href="hydroelectric%20dam">hydroelectric dam</a> along the <a href="Menominee%20River">Menominee River</a> to supply power to the Kingsford mill, bought the Imperial Mine, and opened the Blueberry Mine near <a href="Ishpeming%2C%20Michigan">Ishpeming</a> to supply iron ore. The Ford Railroad was constructed between <a href="L%27Anse%2C%20Michigan">L'Anse</a> and the Cliff River for his logging operations on of timberland purchased in 1922. He often visited the Upper Peninsula on business, but as early as 1917, the year he ran for a seat in the <a href="U.S.%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a>, he sought entry into the Huron Mountain Club. Since the club limited its membership, Ford worked to improve his chances. His admission would ultimately come when M-35 construction was halted in the Huron Mountains.

Hunters, campers, hikers, fishermen, and some landowners opposed highway construction near the Huron Mountains. Rydholm said, "... there seemed to be no groundswell of sentiment in favor of it, but it looked as the though the die was cast and nothing could be done to stop it". The Huron Mountain Club members opposed the highway because it would open vast reaches of the back country and might harm the wilderness. Highway construction would also open the possibility of a resort hotel; William C. Weber, a real estate developer from Detroit, owned property along Mountain Lake, in northern Marquette County. A <a href="Michigan%20Attorney%20General">Michigan attorney general</a>'s opinion provided a way for blocking the road if two-thirds of the property over which the road would pass was owned by people opposed to the project. The proposed highway was to cross two parcels of Huron Mountain Club property, but that was not enough to halt construction.

In 1926, Hebard was elected the new president at the Huron Mountain Club and changed its rules for admission. Before the changes, all existing members voted on new admissions, and four "no" votes meant rejection. After Hebard's changes, only club directors could vote, and only one "no" was needed to block election. In 1927, the road grading for M-35 had reached the Salmon Trout River. That same year, Ford bought more land near Mountain Lake. This property encompassed more than the requisite two-thirds necessary to stop construction of the road. In 1928, the road was moved to connect with the Big Bay Road (CR 550), leaving the stub of "Blind 35" behind. According to club records, "by 1929, M-35 was dead in its tracks and Henry Ford was a member". To commemorate his membership, Ford built a white pine log cabin on club property that cost between $80,000 and $100,000 in 1929 (equivalent to $ to $ in ).

In 1939, M-35 from Negaunee to Big Bay to L'Anse was officially canceled as a state trunkline highway. Constructed portions were turned over to local control, becoming Skanee Road in Baraga County and CR 510 in Marquette County. This left a discontinuous routing for 13 years. The southern segment of M-35 ran from Menominee to Negaunee, and the northern segment ran from Baraga to Ontonagon along the modern <a href="M-38%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-38</a>. The two segments were rejoined in 1953, closing the gap left by the cancelled Huron Mountain route. M-35 signs were added to existing highway signs westward from the end of the southern segment at Negaunee along US 41/M-28 and US 41 to Baraga, to connect with the northern segment westward to Ontonagon.

In 1964, several abandoned underground mine shafts collapsed underneath the roadway, forcing a rerouting of M-35 out of the City of Negaunee. Before the rerouting, M-35 was routed from Palmer north to Negaunee using a portion of County Road near Lucy Hill. It also followed Silver Street connecting with part of <a href="M-28%20Business%20%28Ishpeming-Negaunee%2C%20Michigan%29">Business M-28</a>, a business loop of M-28, through downtown Negaunee to US 41 north of town. This former segment is still shown on some maps (such as <a href="Google%20Maps">Google Maps</a>) as "Old M-35". Since this rerouting, M-35 runs from Palmer past Goose Lake to end in <a href="Negaunee%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee Township</a>. The only "naturbahn", or natural track, <a href="luge">luge</a> run in North America crosses the former routing of M-35 in Negaunee. This luge run crosses over the abandoned street at the end of County Road at Lucy Hill.

The last major changes to M-35 came in January 1969 when the section from Baraga to Ontonagon was given the M-38 designation. The M-35 concurrencies were removed along US 41/M-28 and US 41 in Marquette and Baraga counties. This change shortened the highway designation and moved the northern terminus to the present location in Negaunee Township. Since then, sections of the roadway were realigned in <a href="Richmond%20Township%2C%20Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Richmond Township</a> south of Palmer to straighten some of the many curves between Palmer and Gwinn in 1989. MDOT constructed a new 20-space commuter parking lot at the southern terminus of M-553 at M-35 in August 2008 as part of an effort to offer expanded ride-sharing opportunities in Marquette County.

The southern section of M-35 is a part of the <a href="Lake%20Michigan%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Michigan Circle Tour</a> (LMCT). This tour was created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> and Ontario. On August 26, 2007, MDOT designated the southern section of M-35 along Lake Michigan as the UP Hidden Coast Recreational Heritage Trail running for between Menominee and Gladstone. As a part of the <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a>s Program, M-35 passes the mouths of the <a href="Cedar%20River%20%28Menominee%20County%2C%20Michigan%29">Cedar</a> and <a href="Bark%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Bark</a> rivers. <a href="Wells%20State%20Park%20%28Michigan%29">Wells State Park</a> is located on M-35 in <a href="Cedar%20River%2C%20Michigan">Cedar River</a> and Fuller Park is at the mouth of the Bark River.

Resident Evil 5

Resident Evil 5 is a <a href="third-person%20shooter">third-person shooter</a> video game developed and published by <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> and released in 2009. It is the seventh major installment in the "<a href="Resident%20Evil">Resident Evil</a>" series, and was announced in 2005—the same year its predecessor "<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>" was released. "Resident Evil 5" was released for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> consoles in March 2009 and for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> in September that year. The plot involves an investigation of a terrorist threat by Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) agents <a href="Chris%20Redfield">Chris Redfield</a> and <a href="Sheva%20Alomar">Sheva Alomar</a> in Kijuju, a fictional region of Africa. Chris soon learns that he must confront his past in the form of an old enemy, <a href="Albert%20Wesker">Albert Wesker</a>, and his former partner, <a href="Jill%20Valentine">Jill Valentine</a>.

The gameplay of "Resident Evil 5" is similar to that of the previous installment, though it is the first in the series designed for two-player <a href="co-operative%20gameplay">cooperative gameplay</a>. It has also been considered to be the first game in the main series to depart from the <a href="survival%20horror">survival horror</a> genre, with critics saying it bore more resemblance to an <a href="action%20game">action game</a>. <a href="Motion%20capture">Motion capture</a> was used for the <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s, and it was the first video game to use a <a href="virtual%20camera%20system">virtual camera system</a>. Several staff members from the original "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20%281996%20video%20game%29">Resident Evil</a>" worked on "Resident Evil 5".

"Resident Evil 5" received a positive reception, despite some criticism for its control scheme. The game received some complaints of <a href="racism">racism</a>, though an investigation by the <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">British Board of Film Classification</a> found the complaints were unsubstantiated. "Resident Evil 5" was re-released for <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> in June 2016. As of December 2018, the original release has sold over 7.4 million units. An additional 3.6 million units have been sold between a special edition of the game and releases on other platforms, bringing the total sales to 11 million. It is the best-selling game of the "Resident Evil" franchise, and the original version remained the best-selling individual Capcom release until March 2018, when it was outsold by "". A sequel, "<a href="Resident%20Evil%206">Resident Evil 6</a>", was released in 2012.

Five years after the events of "Resident Evil 4", <a href="Chris%20Redfield">Chris Redfield</a>, now a member of the fictional Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, is dispatched to Kijuju in Africa. He and his new partner <a href="Sheva%20Alomar">Sheva Alomar</a> are tasked with apprehending Ricardo Irving before he can sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. When they arrive, they discover that the locals have been infected by the parasites Las Plagas (those infected are called "Majini") and the BSAA Alpha Team have been killed. Chris and Sheva are rescued by BSAA's Delta Team, which includes Sheva's mentor <a href="List%20of%20Resident%20Evil%20characters%23Josh%20Stone">Josh Stone</a>. In Stone's data Chris sees a photograph of <a href="Jill%20Valentine">Jill Valentine</a>, his old partner, who has been presumed dead after a confrontation with <a href="Albert%20Wesker">Albert Wesker</a>. Chris, Sheva and Delta Team close in on Irving, but he escapes with the aid of a hooded figure. Irving leaves documents that lead Chris and Sheva to marshy oilfields. This is where Irving's deal is to occur, but they discover that the documents are a diversion. When Chris and Sheva try to regroup with Delta Team, they find the team slaughtered by a BOW; Sheva cannot find Stone among the dead. Determined to learn if Valentine is still alive, Chris does not report to headquarters.

Continuing through the marsh, they find Stone injured but safe and track down Irving's boat with his help. Irving injects himself with a variant of the Las Plagas parasite and mutates into a huge octopus-like beast. Chris and Sheva defeat him, and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave to learn more. The cave is the source of a flower used to create viruses previously used by Umbrella, as well as a new strain named Uroboros. Chris and Sheva find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, took over a former <a href="List%20of%20Resident%20Evil%20characters%23Umbrella%20Corporation">Umbrella Corporation</a> underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility, they discover thousands of capsules holding human test subjects. Although Chris finds that one of the capsules is Valentine's, it is empty. When they leave, they discover that Tricell CEO Excella Gionne has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take a chosen few from the chaos of infection and rule them, creating a new breed of humanity. Chris and Sheva pursue Gionne but are stopped by Wesker and the hooded figure, who is revealed to be a mind-controlled Valentine. Gionne and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker; Chris and Sheva fight Valentine, subduing her and removing the mind-control device before she orders Chris to follow Wesker.

Chris and Sheva board the tanker and encounter Gionne, who escapes after dropping a case of syringes; Sheva keeps several. When Chris and Sheva reach the main deck, Wesker announces over the ship's intercom that he has betrayed Gionne and infected her with Uroboros. She mutates into a giant monster, which Chris and Sheva defeat. Valentine radios in, telling Chris and Sheva that Wesker must take precise, regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed; a larger or smaller dose would poison him. Sheva realizes that Gionne's syringes are doses of the drug. Chris and Sheva follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus, injecting him with the syringes Gionne dropped. Wesker tries to escape on the bomber; Chris and Sheva disable it, making him crash-land in a volcano. Furious‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Chris and Sheva through the volcano. They fight him, and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Chris and Sheva are rescued by a helicopter, which is piloted by Valentine and Stone. As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano, Chris and Sheva fire <a href="rocket-propelled%20grenade">rocket-propelled grenade</a>s at Wesker, killing him. In the game's final cutscene, Chris wonders if the world is worth fighting for. Looking at Sheva and Valentine, he decides to live in a world without fear.

"Resident Evil 5" is a <a href="third-person%20shooter">third-person shooter</a> with an over-the-shoulder perspective. Players can use several weapons including handguns, shotguns, automatic rifles, sniper rifles, and grenade launchers, as well as <a href="melee">melee</a> attacks. Players can make quick 180-degree turns to evade enemies. The game involves <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss battles</a>, many of which contain <a href="quick%20time%20event">quick time event</a>s.

As in its predecessor "<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>", players can upgrade weapons with money and treasure collected in-game and heal themselves with herbs, but cannot run and shoot at the same time. New features include infected enemies with guns and grenades, the ability to upgrade weapons at any time from the inventory screen without having to find a merchant, and the equipping of weapons and items in real-time during gameplay. Each player can store nine items. Unlike the previous games, the item size is irrelevant; a herb or a grenade launcher each occupy one space, and four items may be assigned to the <a href="D-pad">D-pad</a>. The game also features fewer puzzles than previous titles.

"Resident Evil 5" is the first game in the "Resident Evil" series designed for two-player <a href="co-operative%20gameplay">cooperative gameplay</a>. The first player controls Chris, a former member of the fictional Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS) and current member of the BSAA, and a second player can control Sheva, who is introduced in this game. If a person plays alone, Sheva is controlled by the game's <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a> (AI). When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Sheva the primary character. Two-player mode is available online or <a href="Split%20screen%20%28computer%20graphics%29">split-screen</a> with a second player using the same console. A second player joining a split-screen game in progress will make the game reload the last <a href="Saved%20game%23Checkpoints">checkpoint</a> (the point at which the game was last saved); the second player joining an online game will have to wait until the first player reaches the next checkpoint, or restarts the previous one, to play. In split-screen mode, one player's viewpoint is presented in the top half of the screen, and the other in the bottom half, but each viewpoint is presented in widescreen format, rather than using the full width of the screen, resulting in unused space to the left and right of the two windows. If one player has critical health, only their partner can resuscitate them, and they will die if their partner cannot reach them. At certain points, players are deliberately separated. Players can trade items during gameplay, although weapons cannot be traded with online players. The game's story-line is linear, and interaction with other characters is mostly limited to cut-scenes.

A version of the "Mercenaries" <a href="minigame">minigame</a> which debuted in "" is included in "Resident Evil 5". This minigame places the player in an enclosed environment with a time limit. Customized weapons cannot be used and players must search for weapons, ammunition, and time bonuses while fighting a barrage of enemies, to score as many points as possible within the time limit. The minigame multiplayer mode was initially offline only; a release-day <a href="patch%20%28computing%29">patch</a> needed to be downloaded to access the online multiplayer modes. "Mercenaries" is unlocked when the game's story mode has been completed.

"Resident Evil 5" was developed by <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> and produced by <a href="Jun%20Takeuchi">Jun Takeuchi</a>, who directed "" and produced "". <a href="Keiji%20Inafune">Keiji Inafune</a>, promotional producer for "<a href="Resident%20Evil%202">Resident Evil 2</a>" and executive producer of the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> version of "Resident Evil 4", supervised the project. Production began in 2005 and at its peak, over 100 people were working on the project. In February 2007, some members of Capcom's <a href="Clover%20Studio">Clover Studio</a> began working on "Resident Evil 5" while others were working on "", which debuted for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>. Yasuhiro Anpo, who worked as a programmer on the original "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20%281996%20video%20game%29">Resident Evil</a>", directed "Resident Evil 5". He was one of several staff members who worked on the original game to be involved in "Resident Evil 5" development. The game's scenario was written by Haruo Murata and Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, based on a story idea by concept director Kenichi Ueda. Takeuchi announced that the game would retain the gameplay model introduced in "Resident Evil 4", with "thematic tastes" from both "Resident Evil 4" and the original "Resident Evil".

While previous Resident Evil games are mainly set at night, the events of Resident Evil 5 occur almost entirely during the day. The decision for this was a combination of the game being set in Africa and advances in hardware improvements which allowed increasingly detailed graphics. On the subject of changes to Valentine and Chris's appearance, production director Yasuhiro Anpo explained that designers tried "to preserve their image and imagined how they would have changed over the passage of time". Their new designs retained the character's signature colors; green for Chris and blue for Valentine. Sheva was redesigned several times during production, though all versions tried to emphasize a combination of "feminine attraction and the strength of a fighting woman". The Majini were designed to be more violent than the "Ganado" enemies in "Resident Evil 4".

The decision for cooperative gameplay was made part-way through development, for a new experience in a "Resident Evil" game. Despite initial concern that a second player would dampen the game's tension and horror, it was later realized that this could actually increase such factors where one player had to be rescued. The decision to retain wide-screen proportions in two-player mode was made to avoid having the first player's screen directly on top of the second, which might be distracting, and the restriction on simultaneously moving and shooting was retained to increase player tension by not allowing them to maneuver freely. Takeuchi cited the film "<a href="Black%20Hawk%20Down%20%28film%29">Black Hawk Down</a>" as an influence on the setting of "Resident Evil 5" and his experience working on "Lost Planet: Extreme Condition" as an influence on its development. When questioned as to why the game was not being released on the Wii, which was the most popular gaming console at the time, Takeuchi responded that although that may have been a good decision "from a business perspective", the Wii was not the best choice in terms of power and visual quality, concluding that he was happy with the console choices they had made.

"Resident Evil 5" runs on version 1.4 of Capcom's <a href="MT%20Framework">MT Framework</a> engine and scenes were recorded by <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a>. It was the first video game to use a <a href="virtual%20camera%20system">virtual camera system</a>, which allowed the developers to see character movements in real time as the motion-capture actors recorded. Actors <a href="Reuben%20Langdon">Reuben Langdon</a>, <a href="Karen%20Dyer">Karen Dyer</a> and Ken Lally portrayed Chris Redfield, Sheva Alomar and Albert Wesker respectively. Dyer also voiced Sheva, while Chris's voice was performed by <a href="Roger%20Craig%20Smith">Roger Craig Smith</a>. Dyer's background training in circus skills helped her win the role of Sheva, as Capcom were searching for someone who could handle the physical skills her motion capture required. She performed her own stunts, and worked in production on the game for over a year, sometimes working 14 hours a day. All of the human character motions were based on motion capture, while the non-human characters in the game were animated by hand.

Kota Suzuki was the game's principal composer and additional music was contributed by Hideki Okugawa, Akihiko Narita and Seiko Kobuchi. The electronic score includes 15 minutes of orchestral music, recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage of <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> Studios in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> with the 103-piece <a href="Hollywood%20Studio%20Symphony">Hollywood Studio Symphony</a>. Other orchestral music and arrangements were by <a href="Wataru%20Hokoyama">Wataru Hokoyama</a>, who conducted the orchestra. Capcom recorded in Los Angeles because they wanted a <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>-style soundtrack to increase the game's cinematic value and global interest. "Resident Evil 5" soundtrack features an original theme song, titled "Pray", which was composed by Suzuki and sung by Oulimata Niang.

Capcom announced "Resident Evil 5" on July 20, 2005, and the company showed a brief trailer for the game at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) in 2007. Its full E3 trailer became available on the <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Marketplace">Xbox Live Marketplace</a> and the <a href="PlayStation%20Store">PlayStation Store</a> on July 26, 2007. A new trailer debuted on <a href="Spike%20TV">Spike TV</a>'s "<a href="List%20of%20programs%20broadcast%20by%20Spike%23Current%20programming">Gametrailers TV</a>" on May 31, 2008, and on the <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> website. A playable <a href="game%20demo">game demo</a> was released in Japan on December 5, 2008, for the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, in North America and Europe for the Xbox 360 on January 26, 2009, and on February 2 for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>. Worldwide downloads of the demo exceeded four million for the two consoles; over 1.8 million were downloaded between January 26 and January 29.

On January 21, 2009, "D+PAD Magazine" reported that "Resident Evil 5" would be released with limited-edition Xbox 360 <a href="Video%20game%20packaging%23Box%20art">box art</a>; pictures of the limited-edition box claimed that it would allow two to sixteen players to play offline via <a href="System%20Link">System Link</a>. Although Capcom said that their "box art isn't lying", the company did not provide details. Capcom soon issued another statement that the box-art information was incorrect, and System Link could support only two players. Microsoft released a limited-edition, red Xbox 360 Elite console which was sold with the game. The package included an exclusive "Resident Evil" theme for the <a href="Xbox%20360%23Interface">Xbox 360 Dashboard</a> and a voucher for "<a href="Super%20Street%20Fighter%20II%20Turbo%20HD%20Remix">Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix</a>" from Xbox Live.

"Resident Evil 5" was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in March 2009, and Capcom released a dedicated <a href="List%20of%20PlayStation%20Home%20Game%20Spaces">Game Space</a> on <a href="PlayStation%20Home">PlayStation Home</a>. The space, "Resident Evil 5 "Studio Lot"" ("Biohazard 5 "Film Studio"" in Japan), had as its <a href="Theme%20%28computing%29">theme</a> the in-game location of Kijuju. Its lounge offered "Resident Evil 5"-related items for sale, events and full game-launching support. Some areas of the space were available only to owners of "Resident Evil 5". The space was released on March 5, 2009, in all PlayStation Home regions. A <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> version was released in September 2009. This version, using Nvidia's <a href="Nvidia%203D%20Vision">3D Vision</a> technology through DirectX 10, includes more costumes and a new mode in the Mercenaries minigame. "Resident Evil 5" was re-released on <a href="Shield%20Android%20TV">Shield Android TV</a> on May 19, 2016, and was re-released on <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> on June 28, 2016, with a physical disc copy following in America on July 12, 2016.

Shortly before the release of "Resident Evil 5," Capcom announced that a competitive multiplayer mode called Versus would be available for download in several weeks. Versus became available for download in Europe and North America on April 7, 2009, through the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store. Versus has two online game types: "Slayers", a point-based game challenging players to kill Majini, and "Survivors", where players hunt each other while dodging and attacking Majini. Both modes can be played by two-player teams. The Microsoft Windows version of "Resident Evil 5" originally did not support <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC).

During <a href="Sony">Sony</a>'s press conference at the 2009 <a href="Tokyo%20Game%20Show">Tokyo Game Show</a> Capcom announced that a special edition of the game, "Biohazard 5: Alternative Edition", would be released in Japan for the PlayStation 3 in the spring of 2010. This edition supports the <a href="PlayStation%20Move">PlayStation Move</a> accessory and includes a new scenario, "Lost in Nightmares", where Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine infiltrate one of Umbrella Corporation co-founder <a href="List%20of%20Resident%20Evil%20characters%23Oswell%20E.%20Spencer">Oswell E. Spencer</a>'s estates in 2006. Another special edition of the game, "Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition", was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in North America and Europe. "Gold Edition" includes "Lost in Nightmares" and another <a href="Campaign%20%28role-playing%20games%29">campaign</a>-expansion episode, "Desperate Escape", where players control Josh Stone and Jill Valentine as they assist Chris and Sheva. The edition also includes the previously released Versus mode, four new costumes and an alternate Mercenaries mode with eight new playable characters, new items and maps. Like "Alternative Edition", "Gold Edition" supports the PlayStation Move accessory with a patch released on September 14, 2010. The Xbox 360 version of "Gold Edition" came in a DVD with a token allowing free download of all DLC, while the PlayStation 3 version had all of the new content on a single <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> disc. On November 5, 2012, "Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition" was placed on the PlayStation Network as a free download for <a href="PlayStation%20Plus">PlayStation Plus</a> users during that month.

As part of the game's conversion to <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steamworks</a>, "Gold Edition" was released for Microsoft Windows on March 26, 2015. Owners of the game from Steam or as a boxed retail Games For Windows Live can acquire a free Steamworks copy of the base game and purchase the new Gold Edition content. The Steamworks version did not allow the use of Nvidia's 3D Vision technology or <a href="Fan%20labor">fan modifications</a>, though Capcom later confirmed a way to work around these issues.

" Resident Evil 5" received generally favourable reviews, according to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. Reviewers praised the game's visuals and content. Corey Cohen of "<a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a>" complimented the game's fast pace, and called the graphics gorgeous. It was praised by Joe Juba and Mark Miller of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>", who said that it had the best graphics of any game to date and that the music and voice acting helped bring the characters to life, and Brian Crecente of "<a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>" said it was one of the most visually stunning games he had ever played. Adam Sessler of "<a href="X-Play">X-Play</a>" said the game's graphics were exceptional, and <a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">"Edge"</a> praised the gameplay as exhilarating and frantic. For <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, Ryan Geddes wrote that the game had a surprisingly high <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a>, and "GameZone" Louis Bedigian said the game was "worth playing through twice in one weekend".

While still giving favorable reviews of the game, several reviewers considered it to be a departure from the survival horror genre, a decision they lamented. Chris Hudak of <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> considered the game to be a "full-on action blockbuster", and Brian Crecente said that about halfway through the game it "dropp[ed] all pretense of being a survival horror title and unmask[ed] itself as an action <a href="shooter%20game">shooter</a> title". Kristan Reed of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> said the game "morphs what was a survival horror adventure into a survival horror shooter", and believed that this attempt to appeal to action gamers would upset some of the series' fans.

Aspects of the game's control scheme were viewed negatively by critics. James Mielke of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> criticized several inconsistencies in the game, such as only being able to take cover from enemy fire in very specific areas. Mielke also criticized its controls, saying that aiming was too slow and noting the inability to strafe away from (or quickly jump back from) enemies. Despite the problems he found it was "still a very fun game". Kristan Reed also had criticism of some controls, such as the speed at which 180-degree turns were performed and difficulty accessing inventory. Joe Juba said that the inability to move and shoot at the same time seemed more "like a cheap and artificial way to increase difficulty than a technique to enhance tension." While praising some aspects of the AI control of Sheva, Ryan Geddes thought that it also had its annoyances, such as its tendency to recklessly expend ammunition and health supplies.

Reception of the downloadable content was favorable. Steven Hopper of "GameZone" rated the "Lost in Nightmares" DLC eight out of ten, saying that despite the episode's brevity it had high replay value and the addition of new multiplayer elements made it a "worthy investment for fans of the original game." Samuel Claiborn of IGN rated the "Desperate Escape" DLC seven out of ten: "Despite Desperate Escape's well-crafted action sequences, I actually found myself missing the unique vibe of Lost in Nightmares. The dynamic between Jill and Josh isn't particularly thrilling, and the one-liners, banter and endearing kitsch are kept to a minimum."

"Resident Evil 5"s 2007 E3 trailer was criticized for depicting a <a href="white%20people">white</a> protagonist killing <a href="black%20people">black</a> enemies in a small African village. According to "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" editor <a href="N%27Gai%20Croal">N'Gai Croal</a>, "There was a lot of imagery in that trailer that dovetailed with classic <a href="racism">racist</a> imagery", although he acknowledged that only the preview had been released. Takeuchi said the game's producers were completely surprised by the complaints. The second trailer for the game, released on May 31, 2008, revealed a more racially diverse group of enemies and the African BSAA agent Sheva, who assists the protagonist. Critics felt that Sheva's character was added to address the issue of racism, though Karen Dyer said the character had been in development before the first trailer was released. Takeuchi denied that complaints about racism had any effect in altering the design of "Resident Evil 5". He acknowledged that different cultures may have had differing opinions about the trailer, though said he did not expect there to be further complaints once the game was released and people were "able to play the game and see what it is for themselves". In a "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" interview, producer Masachika Kawata also addressed the issue: "We can't please everyone. We're in the entertainment business—we're not here to state our political opinion or anything like that. It's unfortunate that some people felt that way."

In "Eurogamer" February 2009 preview of "Resident Evil 5", Dan Whitehead expressed concern about controversy the game might generate: "It plays so blatantly into the old clichés of the dangerous '<a href="wikt%3ADark%20Continent">dark continent</a>' and the primitive lust of its inhabitants that you'd swear the game was written in the 1920s". Whitehead said that these issues became more "outrageous and outdated" as the game progressed and that the addition of the "light-skinned" Sheva just made the overall issue worse. Hillary Golstein from IGN believed that the game was not deliberately racist, and though he did not personally find it offensive, he felt that others would due to the subjective nature of offensiveness. Chris Hudak dismissed any allegations of racism as "stupid". Karen Dyer, who is of Jamaican descent, also dismissed the claims. She said that in over a year of working on the game's development she never encountered anything racially insensitive, and would not have continued working there if she had.

Wesley Yin-Poole of "VideoGamer.com" said that despite the controversy the game was attracting due to alleged racism, no expert opinion had been sought. He asked Glenn Bowman, senior lecturer in <a href="social%20anthropology">social anthropology</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Kent">University of Kent</a>, whether he thought the game was racist. Bowman considered the racism accusations "silly", saying that the game had an <a href="Anti-imperialism">anti-colonial</a> theme and those complaining about the game's racism might be expressing an "inverted racism which says that you can't have scary people who are black". It was reported that one cutscene in the game scene showed "black men" dragging off a screaming white woman; according to Yin-Poole, the allegation was incorrect and the single man dragging the woman was "not obviously black". The scene was submitted to the <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">British Board of Film Classification</a> for evaluation. BBFC head of communications Sue Clark said, "There is only one man pulling the blonde woman in from the balcony [and he] is not black either. As the whole game is set in Africa it is hardly surprising that some of the characters are black ... we do take racism very seriously, but in this case, there is no issue around racism."

Academic journals and conferences, however, have continued to comment on the theme of race within the game. In 2011, Andre Brock from "<a href="Games%20and%20Culture">Games and Culture</a>" said that the game drew from well-established racial and gender stereotypes, saying that the African people were only ever depicted as savage, even before transitioning into zombies. Writing for the <a href="Digital%20Games%20Research%20Association">Digital Games Research Association</a> in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been intended by Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel "<a href="Heart%20of%20Darkness">Heart of Darkness</a>". Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.

Writing for "The Philosophy of Computer Games Conference" in 2015, Harrer and Pichlmair considered "Resident Evil 5" to be "yet another moment in the history of commodity racism, which from the late 19th century onwards allowed popular depictions of racial stereotypes to enter the most intimate spaces of European homes". The authors state that Africa is presented from a Western gaze; "what is presented as 'authentic' blackness conforms to the projected fantasy of predominantly white gaming audience". In 2016, Paul Martin from "<a href="Games%20and%20Culture">Games and Culture</a>" said that the theme of the game could be described as "dark continent", stating that it drew on imagery of European colonialism and depictions of "Blackness" reminiscent of 19th-century European theories on race.

The PlayStation 3 version of "Resident Evil 5" was the top-selling game in Japan in the two weeks following its release, with 319,590 copies sold. In March 2009, it became the fastest-selling game of the franchise in the United Kingdom, and the biggest Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 game release in the country. By December 2018, "Resident Evil 5" had sold 7.4 million copies worldwide between PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and <a href="download">download</a>, and the "Gold Edition" had sold an additional 2.3 million copies across those systems. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions sold another 1.3 million copies combined, bringing the total sales to 11 million units.

The original release of "Resident Evil 5" was Capcom's best-selling individual edition of a game until March 2018, when ""s sales reached 7.5 million units, compared to 7.3 million for "Resident Evil 5" at the time. As of December 2018, when taking into consideration the sales of all versions and re-releases of titles, "Resident Evil 5" was the third-best-selling Capcom game overall, behind and "Monster Hunter: World" (11.9 million) and "<a href="Street%20Fighter%20II">Street Fighter II</a>" (14.75 million). The game remains the best-selling title in the "Resident Evil" franchise, outselling its closest rivals "Resident Evil 6" and "Resident Evil 4" by more than 2 million and 3.5 million units, respectively, as of April 2018.

"Resident Evil 5" won the "Award of Excellence" at the 2009 <a href="Japan%20Game%20Awards">Japan Game Awards</a>. It was nominated for both Best Action/Adventure Game and Best Console Game at the 2008 <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">Game Critics Awards</a>, Best Action Game at the 2009 IGN Game of the Year Awards, and Best Sound Editing in Computer Entertainment at the 2010 <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Sound%20Editors%23Golden%20Reel%20Awards">Golden Reel Awards</a>. It received five nominations at the 2010 Game Audio Network Guild Awards: Audio of the Year, Best Cinematic/Cut-Scene Audio, Best Dialogue, Best Original Vocal Song – Pop (for the theme song "Pray") and Best Use of Multi-Channel Surround in a Game. Karen Dyer was nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance at the 2010 <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> Awards.

Armero tragedy

The Armero tragedy ( ) was one of the major consequences of the eruption of the <a href="Nevado%20del%20Ruiz">Nevado del Ruiz</a> <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> in <a href="Tolima%20Department">Tolima</a>, Colombia, on November 13, 1985. After 69 years of dormancy, the volcano's eruption caught nearby towns unaware, even though the government had received warnings from multiple volcanological organizations to evacuate the area after the detection of volcanic activity two months earlier.

As <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s erupted from the <a href="volcanic%20crater">volcano's crater</a>, they melted the mountain's glaciers, sending four enormous <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s (volcanically induced <a href="mudflow">mudflow</a>s, <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s, and <a href="debris%20flow">debris flow</a>s) down its slopes at . The lahars picked up speed in <a href="gully">gullies</a> and coursed into the six major rivers at the base of the volcano; they engulfed the town of <a href="Armero">Armero</a>, killing more than 20,000 of its almost 29,000 inhabitants. Casualties in other towns, particularly <a href="Chinchin%C3%A1%2C%20Caldas">Chinchiná</a>, brought the overall death toll to 23,000. Footage and photographs of <a href="Omayra%20S%C3%A1nchez">Omayra Sánchez</a>, a young victim of the <a href="Tragedy%20%28event%29">tragedy</a>, were published around the world. Other photographs of the lahars and the impact of the disaster captured attention worldwide and led to controversy over the degree to which the Colombian government was responsible for the disaster. A banner at a mass funeral in Ibagué read, "The volcano didn't kill 22,000 people. The government killed them."

The relief efforts were hindered by the composition of the mud, which made it nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck. By the time relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the victims with serious injuries were dead. The relief workers were horrified by the landscape of fallen trees, disfigured human bodies, and piles of debris from entire houses. This was the second-<a href="List%20of%20volcanic%20eruptions%20by%20death%20toll">deadliest volcanic disaster</a> of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of <a href="Mount%20Pel%C3%A9e">Mount Pelée</a>, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500 AD. The event was a foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by the populace's unawareness of the volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned authorities and media outlets about the danger over the weeks and days leading up to the eruption. <a href="Hazard%20map">Hazard map</a>s for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the sounds of the eruption until it was too late.

Nevado del Ruiz has erupted several times since the disaster, and continues to threaten up to 500,000 people living along the Combeima, Chinchiná, Coello-Toche, and Guali river valleys. A lahar (or group of lahars) similar in size to the 1985 event might travel as far as from the volcano, and could be triggered by a small eruption. To counter this threat, the Colombian government established a specialized office which promotes awareness of natural threats. The <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> also created the <a href="Volcano%20Disaster%20Assistance%20Program">Volcano Disaster Assistance Program</a> and the Volcano Crisis Assistance Team, which evacuated roughly 75,000 people from the area around <a href="Mount%20Pinatubo">Mount Pinatubo</a> before its <a href="Mount%20Pinatubo%231991%20eruption">1991 eruption</a>. In 1988, three years after the eruption, Dr. Stanley Williams of <a href="Louisiana%20State%20University">Louisiana State University</a> stated that, "With the possible exception of <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a> in the state of Washington, no other volcano in the Western Hemisphere is being watched so elaborately" as Nevado del Ruiz. Additionally, many of Colombia's cities have programs to raise awareness of natural disaster planning programs which have helped save lives in natural disasters. Near Nevado del Ruiz in particular, locals have become wary of volcanic activity: when the volcano erupted in 1989, more than 2,300 people living around it were evacuated.

Armero, located from the Nevado del Ruiz volcano and from Colombia's capital of <a href="Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a>, was the third largest town in <a href="Tolima%20Department">Tolima Department</a>, after <a href="Ibagu%C3%A9">Ibagué</a> and <a href="El%20Espinal%2C%20Tolima">Espinal</a>. A prominent farming town before the eruption, it was responsible for roughly one-fifth of <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>'s rice production, and for a large share of the cotton, <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, and coffee crops. Much of this success can be attributed to <a href="Nevado%20del%20Ruiz">Nevado del Ruiz</a>, as the fertile <a href="volcanic%20soil">volcanic soil</a> had stimulated agricultural growth.

Built on top of an <a href="alluvial%20fan">alluvial fan</a> that had been host to historic lahars, the town was previously destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1595 and by mudflows in 1845. In the 1595 eruption, three distinct <a href="Plinian%20eruption">Plinian eruption</a>s produced lahars that claimed the lives of 636 people. During the 1845 event, 1,000 people were killed by earthquake-generated mudflows near the <a href="Magdalena%20River">Magdalena River</a>.

Nevado del Ruiz has undergone three distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 1.8 million years ago. During the present period (beginning 11,000 years ago), it has erupted at least twelve times, producing ashfalls, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. The historically recorded eruptions have primarily involved a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then the formation of <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s. Ruiz's earliest identified <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> eruption was in about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred around 1245, 850, 200 BC and in about 350, 675, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 through March 1985, 1987 through July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a <a href="phreatic%20explosion">phreatic (steam) explosion</a>. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after <a href="Galeras">Galeras</a>.

One week before the eruption, the <a href="Palace%20of%20Justice%20siege">Palace of Justice siege</a> took place. The assailants (<a href="19th%20of%20April%20Movement">M-19</a> a Marxist, Terrorist Insurgency group) planned to hold a trial involving Colombian President <a href="Belisario%20Betancur">Belisario Betancur</a>. He refused to participate and sent the national army into the building. The attackers were holding several hundred hostages, including the 24 Supreme Court justices and 20 other judges. In the ensuing battle between the two forces, more than 75 hostages died (including 11 judges). This disaster, coupled with the Armero tragedy, spurred the Colombian government to predict and prepare for a broad range of threats.

In late 1984, geologists noticed that seismic activity in the area had begun to increase. Increased <a href="fumarole">fumarole</a> activity, deposition of <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> on the summit of the volcano, and <a href="phreatic%20eruption">phreatic eruption</a>s also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new <a href="magma">magma</a> had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.

An Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and found them to be a mixture of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a>, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. Publishing a report for officials on October 22, 1985, the scientists determined that the risk of lahars was unusually high. To prepare for the eruption, the report gave several simple preparedness techniques to local authorities. Another team gave the local officials <a href="seismograph">seismograph</a>s, but no instructions on how to operate them.

Volcanic activity increased again in November 1985 as magma neared the surface. Increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elemental sulfur began to appear in the volcano. The water content of the fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs in the vicinity of Nevado del Ruiz became enriched with magnesium, calcium and potassium, leached from the magma.

The <a href="thermodynamic%20equilibrium">thermodynamic equilibration</a> temperatures, corresponding to the chemical composition of the discharged gases, ranged from ; this is a measure of the temperature at which the gases equilibrated within the volcano. The extensive <a href="degassing">degassing</a> of the magma caused pressure to build up inside the volcano in the space above the magma, which eventually resulted in the explosive eruption.

In September 1985, as earthquakes and phreatic eruptions rocked the area, local officials began planning for an evacuation. In October, a <a href="hazard%20map">hazard map</a> was finalized for the area around Nevado del Ruiz. This map highlighted the danger from falling material—including ash and <a href="volcanic%20rock">rock</a>—near <a href="Murillo%2C%20Tolima">Murillo</a>, <a href="Santa%20Isabel%2C%20Tolima">Santa Isabel</a>, and <a href="Libano%2C%20Tolima">Libano</a>, as well as the threat of lahars in <a href="Mariquita%2C%20Tolima">Mariquita</a>, <a href="Armero-Guayabal">Guayabal</a>, <a href="Chinchin%C3%A1%2C%20Caldas">Chinchiná</a> and <a href="Armero">Armero</a>.

The map was poorly distributed to the people at high risk from Ruiz: many survivors had never heard of it, even though several of the country's major newspapers featured versions of the map. Henry Villegas of INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) stated that the hazard maps clearly demonstrated that Armero would be affected by the lahars, but that the map "met with strong opposition from economic interests." He added that because the map was not prepared long before the eruption, mass production and distribution of it in time was difficult.

At least one of the hazard maps published in the prominent "<a href="El%20Espectador">El Espectador</a>" newspaper in Bogotá included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area.

Another map published by the "<a href="El%20Tiempo%20%28Colombia%29">El Tiempo</a>" newspaper featured illustrations which "gave a perception of topography to the public unfamiliar with maps, allowing them to relate hazard zones to the landscape." In spite of this presentation that was keyed to the audience, the map ended up a more artistic representation of the risk than a purely scientific one.

The day of the eruption, black ash columns erupted from the volcano at approximately 3:00 pm local time. The local Civil Defense director was promptly alerted to the situation. He contacted INGEOMINAS, which ruled that the area should be evacuated; he was then told to contact the Civil Defense directors in Bogotá and Tolima. Between 5:00 and 7:00 pm, the ash stopped falling, and local officials instructed people to "stay calm" and go inside. Around 5:00 pm an emergency committee meeting was called, and when it ended at 7:00 pm, several members contacted the regional Red Cross over the intended evacuation efforts at Armero, Mariquita, and <a href="Honda%2C%20Colombia">Honda</a>.

The Ibagué Red Cross contacted Armero's officials and ordered an evacuation, which was not carried out because of electrical problems caused by a storm. The storm's heavy rain and constant thunder may have overpowered the noise of the volcano, and with no systematic warning efforts, the residents of Armero were completely unaware of the continuing activity at Ruiz. At 9:45 pm, after the volcano had erupted, Civil Defense officials from Ibagué and Murillo tried to warn Armero's officials, but could not make contact. Later they overheard conversations between individual officials of Armero and others; famously, a few heard the Mayor of Armero speaking on a <a href="ham%20radio">ham radio</a>, saying "that he did not think there was much danger", when he was overtaken by the lahar.

At 9:09 p.m., on November 13, 1985, Nevado del Ruiz ejected <a href="dacite">dacitic</a> <a href="tephra">tephra</a> more than into the atmosphere. The total mass of the erupted material (including magma) was 35 million metric tons, only three percent of the amount that erupted from <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a> in 1980. The eruption reached 3 on the <a href="Volcanic%20Explosivity%20Index">Volcanic Explosivity Index</a>. The mass of the ejected sulfur dioxide was about 700,000 metric tons, or about two percent of the mass of the erupted solid material, making the eruption unusually sulfur rich.

The eruption produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks, destroying a small lake that was observed in Arenas' crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty, and may contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice, an effect confirmed by the large amounts of <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a>s and <a href="chloride">chloride</a>s found in the lahar flow.

The lahars, formed of water, ice, <a href="pumice">pumice</a>, and other rocks, incorporated clay from eroding soil as they traveled down the volcano's flanks. They ran down the volcano's sides at an average speed of , dislodging rock and destroying vegetation. After descending thousands of meters down the side of the volcano, the lahars followed the six river valleys leading from the volcano, where they grew to almost four times their original volume. In the Gualí River, a lahar reached a maximum width of .

Survivors in Armero described the night as "quiet". <a href="Volcanic%20ash">Volcanic ash</a> had been falling throughout the day, but residents were informed it was nothing to worry about. Later in the afternoon, ash began falling again after a long period of quiet. Local radio stations reported that residents should remain calm and ignore the material. One survivor reported going to the fire department to be informed that the ash was "nothing".

During the night, the electrical power suddenly turned off and the radios went silent. Just before 11:30 p.m., a huge stream of water swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people. A loud roar could be heard from the mountain, but the residents were panicked over what they believed to be a flood.
At 11:30 p.m., the first lahar hit, followed shortly by the others. One of the lahars virtually erased Armero; three-quarters of its 28,700 inhabitants were killed. Proceeding in three major waves, this lahar was deep, moved at , and lasted ten to twenty minutes. Traveling at about , the second lahar lasted thirty minutes and was followed by smaller pulses.

A third major pulse brought the lahar's duration to roughly two hours. By that point, 85 percent of Armero was enveloped in mud. Survivors described people holding on to debris from their homes in attempts to stay above the mud. Buildings collapsed, crushing people and raining down debris.

The front of the lahar contained boulders and cobbles that would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused lacerations. Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts — the eyes, ears, and mouth — and placed pressure capable of inducing <a href="traumatic%20asphyxia">traumatic asphyxia</a> in one or two minutes upon people buried in it. Martí and Ernst state in their work "Volcanoes and the Environment" that they believe that many who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they were trapped, or contracted hypothermia, though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm.

Another lahar, which descended through the valley of the Chinchiná River, killed about 1,800 people and destroyed 400 homes in Chinchiná. In total, more than 23,000 people were killed, approximately 5,000 were injured, and 5,000 homes throughout thirteen villages were destroyed. Some 230,000 people were affected, were disrupted, and there were nearly 20,000 survivor-refugees. The Armero tragedy, as the event came to be known, was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of <a href="Mount%20Pel%C3%A9e">Mount Pelée</a>, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic eruption recorded since 1500 AD. It is also the deadliest lahar, and Colombia's worst natural disaster.

The loss of life was exacerbated by the lack of an accurate timeframe for the eruption and the unwillingness of local authorities to take costly preventative measures without clear signs of imminent danger. Because its last substantial eruption had occurred 140 years earlier, in 1845, it was difficult for many to accept the danger presented by the volcano; locals even called it the "Sleeping Lion."

Hazard maps showing that Armero would be completely flooded after an eruption were distributed more than a month before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and <a href="civil%20defense">civil defense</a> agencies for scaremongering. The eruption occurred at the height of <a href="guerrilla">guerrilla</a> <a href="Colombian%20armed%20conflict%20%281964%E2%80%93present%29">warfare</a> in Bogotá, Colombia's capital, and so the government and army were preoccupied at the time of the eruption.

The day after the eruption, relief workers were appalled at its impact. The lahars had left behind a gray mass which covered the entire town. Armero was dotted with broken trees and horribly disfigured human bodies. Debris from huts and homes protruded from beneath the gray mud. A few bags filled with crops were discovered in the mud. Workers described an acrid smell of "rotting bodies, [...] wood smoke and decaying vegetables." To the horror of these workers, who were scrambling to begin relief efforts, survivors let out moans of pain and agony. The damages were assessed at six billion dollars, an amount approximately one-fifth of Colombia's 1985 <a href="Gross%20National%20Product">Gross National Product</a>.

As news of the catastrophe spread around the world, the ongoing Colombian presidential election stopped, and the guerrilla fighters stopped their campaign "in view of the painful tragedy that has befallen our [the Colombian fighters] nation." Tickets for Colombian national championship soccer games added a surcharge of five cents to go to relief efforts.

Scientists who later analyzed the seismograph data noticed that several <a href="Prediction%20of%20volcanic%20activity">long-period earthquake</a>s (which begin strongly and then slowly die out) had occurred in the final hours before the eruption. Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that, "the volcano was screaming 'I'm about to explode'", but the scientists who were studying the volcano at the time of the eruption were not able to read the signal.

The eruption occurred two months after the <a href="1985%20Mexico%20City%20earthquake">1985 Mexico City earthquake</a>, limiting the amount of supplies that could be sent to each of the disasters. Efforts were organized in <a href="Ibagu%C3%A9%2C%20Tolima">Ibagué</a> and Bogotá for Armero and in <a href="Cali">Cali</a> for Chinchina, where medical teams gathered. Makeshift <a href="triage">triage</a> stations were established in Lerida, Guayabal, and Mariquita, and soon were overwhelmed with the sheer number of victims. The remaining victims were directed to Ibagué's hospitals, as local institutions had already been destroyed or were at risk from further lahars.

The US government spent over $1 million in aid (equivalent to $ million today), and US Ambassador to Colombia Charles S. Gillespie, Jr. donated an initial $25,000 to Colombian disaster assistance institutions ($ today). The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance of the US Agency for International Development (AID) sent one member of the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS), along with an AID disaster-relief expert and 12 helicopters with support and medical personnel from <a href="Panama">Panama</a>.

The US subsequently sent additional aircraft and supplies, including 500 tents, 2,250 blankets, and several tent repair kits. Twenty-four other nations contributed to the rescue and assistance of survivors. Ecuador supplied a mobile hospital, and Iceland's Red Cross sent $4,650 ($ today). The French government sent their own medical supplies with 1,300 tents. Japan sent $1.25 million ($ million today), along with eight doctors, nurses, and engineers, plus $50,000 ($ today) to the United Nations for relief efforts. Another $50,000 ($ today) was donated by the <a href="Lions%20Clubs%20International">Lions Clubs International Foundation</a>.

Rescue efforts were hindered by the soft mud that was up to deep in some places, making it virtually impossible for anyone to traverse it without sinking in. To make the situation worse, the highway connected to Armero and several bridges to it had been demolished by the lahars. It took twelve hours for the first survivors to be rescued, so those with serious but treatable injuries probably died before the rescuers arrived.

Because Armero's hospital was destroyed in the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and rescue teams came from all over the country. Of the 1,244 patients spread over the clinics, 150 died from infection or associated <a href="complication%20%28medicine%29">complications</a>. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their lacerations been thoroughly cleaned, many of these people could have been saved.

On November 20, 1985, one week later, rescue efforts began to cease. Nearly 4,000 relief workers and rescue team members were still searching for survivors, with little hope of finding any. By then, the official death toll was registered at 22,540 people; additional counts showed that 3,300 were missing, 20,000 homeless, and 4,000 injured. Looters raided the ruins and survivors faced concerns of typhus and yellow fever. For most of the relief workers, their job was over.

The eruption was used as an example for psychiatric recuperation after natural disasters by Robert Desjarlais and Leon Eisenberg in their work "World Mental Health: Problems and Priorities in Low-Income Countries". The authors were concerned that only initial treatment for the survivors' <a href="psychological%20trauma">psychological trauma</a> was conducted. One study showed that the victims of the eruption suffered from anxiety and depression, which can lead to alcohol abuse, marital problems and other social issues.

Rafael Ruiz, an Army Major who briefly served as Armero's provisional mayor after the disaster, stated that there were survivors who, due to the trauma of the event, were "jittery", experienced "nightmares", and suffered from "emotional problems." He added that the progress made by Christmas of 1985 was considerable, but that there was "still a long way to go."

A lack of preparation for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking that they might be buried by the mudflows.

The disaster gained international notoriety due in part to a photograph taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named <a href="Omayra%20S%C3%A1nchez">Omayra Sánchez</a>, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention of the reporters at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).

An appeal to the government for a pump to lower the water around her was left unanswered, and she succumbed to <a href="gangrene">gangrene</a> and hypothermia after 60 hours of being trapped. Her death epitomized the tragic nature of the Armero disaster – she could have been saved had the government responded promptly and addressed the concerns over the volcano's potency. The photograph earned the World Press Photo of the Year for "capturing the event of greatest journalistic importance".

Two photographers from the "<a href="Miami%20Herald">Miami Herald</a>" won a <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> for photographing the effects of the lahar. Dr. Stanley Williams of <a href="Louisiana%20State%20University">Louisiana State University</a> said that following the eruption, "With the possible exception of Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington, no other volcano in the Western Hemisphere is being watched so elaborately." In response to the eruption, the USGS <a href="Volcano%20Disaster%20Assistance%20Program">Volcano Crisis Assistance Team</a> was formed in 1986, and the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program.
The volcano erupted several more times between 1985 and 1994.

Concerns over the alleged negligence of local officials to alert locals of the volcano's threat led to controversy. The mayor of Armero, Ramon Rodriguez and other local officials had tried to bring the volcano's potential eruption to the attention of the Colombian government, but to no avail. For months, Rodriguez appealed to various officials, including congressmen and the Governor of Tolima Department. Rodriguez once referred to the volcano as a "time bomb" and told reporters that he believed an eruption would disrupt the natural dam above Armero, resulting in floods.

Despite his persistence, only one congressman managed to inquire about the reality of the situation. Reports from the Colombian Minister of Mines, Minister of Defence, and Minister of Public Works "all asserted that the government was aware of the risk from the volcano and was acting to protect the population". The lack of responsibility for the disaster prompted lawmakers to campaign for Tolima's governor (Eduardo Alzate Garcia) to resign. In the media, similar thoughts and questions were hotly debated. One of the most aggressive campaigns came from a mass funeral in Ibagué for the victims, claiming that "The volcano didn't kill 22,000 people. The government killed them."

The volcano continues to pose a serious threat to nearby towns and villages. Of the threats, the one with the most potential for danger is that of small-volume eruptions, which can destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. Although much of the volcano's glacier mass has <a href="Retreat%20of%20glaciers%20since%201850">retreated</a>, a significant volume of ice still sits atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif. Melting just 10 percent of the ice would produce lahars with a volume of up to similar to the lahar that destroyed Armero in 1985. In just hours, these lahars can travel up to along river valleys.

Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, with 100,000 individuals being considered to be at high risk. Lahars pose a threat to the nearby towns of <a href="Honda%2C%20Tolima">Honda</a>, Mariquita, <a href="Ambalema">Ambalema</a>, Chinchina, <a href="Herveo">Herveo</a>, <a href="Villahermosa%2C%20Tolima">Villa Hermosa</a>, <a href="Salgar">Salgar</a> and <a href="La%20Dorada%2C%20Caldas">La Dorada</a>. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two-million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz–Tolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of <a href="El%20Dorado%20International%20Airport">Bogotá's airport</a> due to ashfall.

As the Armero tragedy was exacerbated by the lack of early warnings, unwise land use, and the unpreparedness of nearby communities, the government of Colombia created a special program, the "Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres" (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), now known as the "Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres" (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness)to prevent such incidents in the future.

All Colombian cities were directed to promote prevention planning to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters, and evacuations due to volcanic hazards have been carried out. About 2,300 people living along five nearby rivers were evacuated when Nevado del Ruiz erupted again in 1989. When another Colombian volcano, <a href="Nevado%20del%20Huila">Nevado del Huila</a>, erupted in April 2008, thousands of people were evacuated because volcanologists worried that the eruption could be another "Nevado del Ruiz".

The lessons from the Armero tragedy have inspired a <a href="Mount%20Rainier%20Volcano%20Lahar%20Warning%20System">lahar warning system for Mt. Rainier</a>, which has a similar potential for lahars.

Armero was never rebuilt after the tragedy. Instead, the survivors were relocated to the towns of Guayabal and <a href="L%C3%A9rida%2C%20Tolima">Lérida</a>, rendering Armero a <a href="ghost%20town">ghost town</a>.

A little less than one year later, Pope John Paul II flew over Armero and then visited Lérida's refugee camps with Colombian President Belisario Betancur. He spoke about the disaster and declared the site of Armero "holy land". Although many victims of the disaster were commemorated, <a href="Omayra%20S%C3%A1nchez">Omayra Sánchez</a> in particular was immortalized by poems, novels, and music pieces. One work ("Adios, Omayra") by Eduardo Santa illustrated the girl's last days of life and her symbolism of the catastrophe. Survivors were also recognized in <a href="Germ%C3%A1n%20Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Barrag%C3%A1n">Germán Santa María Barragán</a>'s dramatized television special titled "No Morirás" (You Will Not Die). Much of the cast was composed of victims of the tragedy who appeared at the cast calls to be extras.

At the end of 2015, it was announced that "Armero", a film about the tragedy, would be released sometime in 2016. Directed by Christian Mantilla, the movie tells the story of the events that took place in November 1985. The movie was released on September 21, 2017.

Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria

Ivan Alexander (, transliterated "Ivan Aleksandǎr"; pronounced ; original spelling: ), also sometimes <a href="Anglicization">Anglicized</a> as John Alexander, ruled as <a href="List%20of%20Bulgarian%20monarchs">Emperor</a> ("<a href="Tsar">Tsar</a>") of <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> from 1331 to 1371, during the <a href="Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Second Bulgarian Empire</a>. The date of his birth is unknown. He died on 17 February 1371. The long reign of Ivan Alexander is considered a transitional period in Bulgarian medieval history. Ivan Alexander began his rule by dealing with internal problems and external threats from Bulgaria's neighbours, the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> and <a href="Serbian%20Empire">Serbia</a>, as well as leading his empire into a period of economic recovery and cultural and religious renaissance.

However, the emperor was later unable to cope with the mounting incursions of <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> forces, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages%23Golden%20Era%20.281308%E2%80%931490.29">Hungarian</a> invasions from the northwest and the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a>. In an ill-fated attempt to combat these problems, he divided the country between his two sons, thus forcing it to face the imminent Ottoman conquest weakened and divided.

Ivan Alexander was the son of the "<a href="despotes">despotēs</a>" Sracimir of <a href="Kran%2C%20Stara%20Zagora%20Province">Kran</a> by <a href="Keratsa%20Petritsa">Petrica</a>, a sister of <a href="Michael%20Shishman%20of%20Bulgaria">Michael Asen III of Bulgaria</a>. Therefore, Ivan Alexander was a nephew of Michael Asen III. Paternally, Ivan Alexander descended from the <a href="Asen%20dynasty">Asen dynasty</a>. By 1330 Ivan Alexander was himself a "despotēs" and governed the city of <a href="Lovech">Lovech</a>. Together with his father and his father-in-law <a href="Basarab%20I%20of%20Wallachia">Basarab</a> of <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a>, Ivan Alexander fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Velbazhd">Battle of Velbazhd</a> against the Serbs at modern-day <a href="Kyustendil">Kyustendil</a> in 1330, in which Bulgaria suffered defeat. The defeat, combined with the worsening relations with the Byzantine Empire, precipitated an internal crisis, which was exacerbated by an invasion of the Byzantines. A <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> drove <a href="Ivan%20Stephen%20of%20Bulgaria">Ivan Stefan</a> out of the capital <a href="Veliko%20Tarnovo">Tarnovo</a> in 1331, and the conspirators placed Ivan Alexander on the throne.

The new ruler set about consolidating his position by regaining territories recently lost to the Byzantine Empire. In 1331 Ivan Alexander campaigned around <a href="Edirne">Adrianople</a> and reconquered northeastern <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="Stefan%20Uro%C5%A1%20IV%20Du%C5%A1an%20of%20Serbia">Stefan Uroš IV Dušan</a> deposed his father <a href="Stefan%20Uro%C5%A1%20III%20De%C4%8Danski%20of%20Serbia">Stefan Uroš III Dečanski</a> and became <a href="List%20of%20Serbian%20monarchs">Serbian king</a> in 1331. This helped normalize the previously tense relations between the two countries. Ivan Alexander and Stefan Uroš IV Dušan concluded an alliance, which was cemented by the marriage of the Serbian king to <a href="Helena%20of%20Bulgaria">Helena of Bulgaria</a>, a sister of Ivan Alexander, on <a href="Easter">Easter</a> 1332.

At about the same time, <a href="Belaur">Belaur</a>, a brother of Michael Asen III, rebelled in <a href="Vidin">Vidin</a>, probably in support of his deposed nephew Ivan Stefan's claim to the throne. The advance of the Byzantine Emperor <a href="Andronikos%20III%20Palaiologos">Andronikos III Palaiologos</a> against Bulgaria in the summer of 1332 protracted military operations against the rebels. The Byzantines overran Bulgarian-controlled northeastern Thrace, but Ivan Alexander rushed southward with a small army and swiftly caught up with Andronikos III at Rusokastro.

After giving the impression that he wished to negotiate, Ivan Alexander, reinforced by <a href="Mongols">Mongol</a> cavalry, overwhelmed the smaller but better organized Byzantine army in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rusokastro">Battle of Rusokastro</a>. The contested cities surrendered to Ivan Alexander, while Andronikos III sought refuge within the walls of Rusokastro. The war ended with Ivan Alexander meeting Andronikos and agreeing a peace based on the "<a href="status%20quo">status quo</a>". To seal the alliance, he betrothed his eldest son, Michael Asen IV, to Andronikos's daughter Maria (Eirene), the marriage eventually taking place in 1339. The Bulgarian emperor was now free to turn his attentions to Belaur, but it was not until 1336 or 1337 that the rebellion in the northwest was put down.

In about 1332 Ivan Alexander had crowned his eldest son Michael Asen IV co-emperor, perhaps to safeguard possession of the throne by his own family. He followed up this traditional association with the coronation of his younger sons <a href="Ivan%20Sratsimir%20of%20Bulgaria">Ivan Sracimir</a> and Ivan Asen IV in 1337. Ivan Alexander may have intended the creation of two younger co-emperors to establish immediate control over important cities and regions, as Ivan Sracimir was eventually based in Vidin, and Ivan Asen IV perhaps in <a href="Preslav">Preslav</a>. Nevertheless, this was a marked departure from Byzantine practice, in which younger sons of the sovereign were made "despotēs", whether they were charged with a territorial administration or not.

In the early 1340s relations with the Byzantine Empire temporarily deteriorated. Ivan Alexander demanded the extradition of his cousin <a href="Shishman%20%28son%20of%20Michael%20Shishman%29">Šišman</a>, one of the sons of Michael Asen III, threatening the Byzantine government with war. Ivan Alexander's show of force backfired, as the Byzantines managed to see through his intentions and sent against him the fleet of their ally, the Turkish <a href="emir%20of%20Smyrna">emir of Smyrna</a> <a href="Umur%20Beg">Umur Beg</a>. Landing in the <a href="Danube%20Delta">Danube Delta</a>, they pillaged the countryside and attacked nearby Bulgarian cities. Forced to restrain his demands, Ivan Alexander invaded the Byzantine Empire again at the end of 1341, claiming that he was summoned by the people of Adrianople. However, Ivan Alexander's troops were defeated twice by Turkish allies of the Byzantines near the city.

In 1341–1347 the Byzantine Empire was plunged into a <a href="Byzantine%20civil%20war%20of%201341%E2%80%931347">protracted civil war</a> between the regency for Emperor <a href="John%20V%20Palaiologos">John V Palaiologos</a> under <a href="Anna%20of%20Savoy">Anna of Savoy</a> and his intended guardian <a href="John%20VI%20Kantakouzenos">John VI Kantakouzenos</a>. The neighbours of the Byzantines took advantage of the civil war, and while Stefan Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia sided with John VI Kantakouzenos, Ivan Alexander backed John V Palaiologos and his regency. Although the two Balkan rulers picked opposite sides in the Byzantine civil war, they maintained their alliance with each other. As the price for Ivan Alexander's support, the regency for John V Palaiologos ceded him the city of Philippopolis (<a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a>) and nine important fortresses in the <a href="Rhodope%20Mountains">Rhodope Mountains</a> in 1344. This peaceful turnover constituted the last major success of Ivan Alexander's foreign policy.

During the same period, the Serbian king took advantage of the Byzantine civil war to take possession of what is now <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>, and of most of <a href="Albania">Albania</a> and northern <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. In 1345 he began to call himself "Emperor of Serbs and Greeks", and in 1346 he was crowned as such by the newly created <a href="Serbian%20Patriarch">Serbian Patriarch</a>. These actions, which the Byzantines received with indignation, appear to have been supported by Bulgaria, as the <a href="Patriarch%20of%20Bulgaria">Patriarch of Bulgaria</a> Simeon had participated in both the creation of a <a href="Serbian%20Patriarchate%20of%20Pe%C4%87">Serbian Patriarchate of Peć</a> and the imperial coronation of Stefan Uroš IV Dušan.

By the second half of the 1340s, little remained of Ivan Alexander's initial successes. John VI Kantakouzenos' Turkish allies pillaged parts of Bulgarian Thrace in 1346, 1347, 1349, 1352 and 1354, to which were added the ravages of the Black Death. The Bulgarians' attempts to repel the invaders met with repeated failure, and Ivan Alexander's third son and co-emperor, Ivan Asen IV, was killed in battle against the Turks in 1349, as was his older brother <a href="Michael%20Asen%20IV%20of%20Bulgaria">Michael Asen IV</a> in 1355 or a little earlier.

By 1351 the Byzantine civil war was over, and John VI Kantakouzenos had realized the threat posed by the Ottomans to the <a href="Balkans">Balkan Peninsula</a>. He appealed to the rulers of Serbia and Bulgaria for a united effort against the Turks and asked Ivan Alexander for money to construct warships, but his appeals fell on deaf ears as his neighbours distrusted his intentions. A new attempt for cooperation between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire followed in 1355, after John VI Kantakouzenos had been forced to abdicate and John V Palaiologos had been established as supreme emperor. To cement the treaty, Ivan Alexander's daughter <a href="Keratsa%20of%20Bulgaria">Keraca Marija</a> was married off to the future Byzantine Emperor <a href="Andronikos%20IV%20Palaiologos">Andronikos IV Palaiologos</a>, but the alliance failed to produce concrete results.

At home Ivan Alexander compromised the internal stability of his realm by divorcing his first wife <a href="Theodora%20of%20Wallachia">Theodora of Wallachia</a> (in about 1349) and marrying a converted <a href="Jew">Jew</a>, also named <a href="Sarah%20%28Theodora%29">Theodora</a>. The new marriage produced new sons, whom Ivan Alexander proceeded to crown co-emperors, <a href="Ivan%20Shishman%20of%20Bulgaria">Ivan Šišman</a> in about 1356 and <a href="Ivan%20Asen%20V%20of%20Bulgaria">Ivan Asen V</a> by 1359. Ivan Alexander's last surviving son from his first marriage, the co-emperor Ivan Sracimir, became effectively independent around 1356; and Ivan Alexander's control over other powerful vassals, such as the rulers of <a href="Wallachia">Wallachia</a> and <a href="Dobruja">Dobruja</a>, who pursued their own foreign policies, was hardly stronger.

From the middle of the 14th century, Bulgaria fell prey to the aspirations of the <a href="Capetian%20House%20of%20Anjou">Angevin</a> king <a href="Louis%20I%20of%20Hungary">Louis I of Hungary</a>, who annexed <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a> in 1352 and established a vassal principality there, before <a href="Hungarian%20occupation%20of%20Vidin">conquering Vidin</a> in 1365, and taking Ivan Sratsimir and his family into captivity.

In the meantime Bulgarians and Byzantines had clashed again in 1364. In 1366, when Emperor <a href="John%20V%20Palaiologos">John V Palaiologos</a> was returning from his trip to the west, the Bulgarians refused to let him pass through Bulgaria. This stance backfired, as another Byzantine ally, Count <a href="Amadeus%20VI%2C%20Count%20of%20Savoy">Amadeus VI of Savoy</a>, leading the <a href="Savoyard%20crusade">Savoyard crusade</a>, captured several Bulgarian maritime cities in retaliation, including Ankhialos (<a href="Pomorie">Pomorie</a>) and Mesembria (<a href="Nesebar">Nesebǎr</a>), though he failed to take <a href="Varna">Varna</a>. Outmanoeuvred, Ivan Alexander was forced to make peace.

The captured cities were turned over to the Byzantine Empire, while Emperor John V Palaiologos paid the sum of 180,000 <a href="Italian%20coin%20florin">florins</a> to Ivan Alexander. The Bulgarian emperor used this sum and territorial concessions to induce his at least "<a href="de%20jure">de jure</a>" vassals <a href="Dobrotitsa">Dobrotica</a> of Dobruja and <a href="Vladislav%20I%20of%20Wallachia">Vladislav I of Wallachia</a> to reconquer Vidin from the Hungarians. The war was successful, and Ivan Sracimir was reinstalled in Vidin in 1369, although the Hungarian king forced him to acknowledge his overlordship.

The relatively successful resolution of the crisis in the northwest did nothing to help recover the losses in the southeast. To make matters worse, in 1369 (the date is disputed), the Ottoman Turks under <a href="Murad%20I">Murad I</a> conquered Adrianople (in 1363) and made it the effective capital of their expanding state. At the same time, they also captured the Bulgarian cities of Philippopolis and Boruj (<a href="Stara%20Zagora">Stara Zagora</a>). As Bulgaria and the Serbian princes in Macedonia prepared for united action against the Turks, Ivan Alexander died on February 17, 1371. He was succeeded by his sons Ivan Sracimir in Vidin and Ivan Šišman in Tǎrnovo, while the rulers of Dobruja and Wallachia achieved further independence.

During Ivan Alexander's rule, the Second Bulgarian Empire entered a period of cultural renaissance, which is sometimes referred to as the "Second Golden Age of Bulgarian culture", the original one being the rule of <a href="Simeon%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Simeon the Great</a>. A large number of Bulgarian monasteries and churches were constructed or renovated on the order of Ivan Alexander. Mural <a href="donor%20portrait">portraits of him as a donor</a> can be seen in the <a href="Bachkovo%20Monastery">Bachkovo Monastery</a>'s ossuary and in the <a href="Rock-hewn%20Churches%20of%20Ivanovo">Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo</a>. Donor's deeds of Ivan Alexander prove that the monasteries of the Holy Mother of God Eleoussa and St Nicholas in Nesebǎr were reconstructed during that period, as was the <a href="Peshtera%20Monastery">St Nicholas monastery</a> near <a href="Pernik">Pernik</a>, according to a <a href="Hilandar">Hilandar</a> monastery deed. In addition, the tsar also initiated the construction of the <a href="Dragalevtsi%20Monastery">Dragalevci</a> and <a href="Kilifarevo">Kilifarevo</a> monasteries.

Literary activity also flourished during the reign of Ivan Alexander. Several important literary works were created in the period, such as the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Bulgarian%20language">Middle Bulgarian</a> translation of the <a href="Constantine%20Manasses">Manasses Chronicle</a> (1344–1345), currently preserved in the <a href="Vatican%20Secret%20Archives">Vatican Secret Archives</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, the richly illustrated <a href="Tetraevangelia%20of%20Ivan%20Alexander">Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander</a> (1355–1356), now exhibited in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>, the <a href="Tomi%C4%87%20Psalter">Tomić Psalter</a> (1360), today in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, and the <a href="Sofia%20Psalter">Sofia Psalter</a> (1337).

Ivan Alexander's rule was also marked by efforts to strengthen the position of the <a href="Bulgarian%20Orthodox%20Church">Bulgarian Orthodox Church</a> by pursuing <a href="heresy">heretics</a> and Jews. He organized two anti-heretical church councils, in 1350 and 1359–1360, that condemned various sects such as the <a href="Bogomilism">Bogomils</a>, the <a href="Adamites">Adamites</a> and the <a href="Judaizers">Judaizers</a>.

The spiritual practice of <a href="hesychasm">hesychasm</a>, a form of incantatory prayer, deeply influenced certain areas of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> world of the 14th century. A notable Bulgarian representative of the movement during Ivan Alexander's reign was <a href="Theodosius%20of%20Tarnovo">Theodosius of Tǎrnovo</a>.

During this time, the Bulgarian Empire had trade relations with the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> maritime powers <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venice</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoa</a> and <a href="Republic%20of%20Ragusa">Ragusa</a>. In 1353, Ivan Alexander issued a charter allowing Venetian merchants to buy and sell goods throughout Bulgaria after <a href="Doge%20of%20Venice">Doge</a> <a href="Andrea%20Dandolo">Andrea Dandolo</a> assured him they would observe the prior treaties between the two countries.

In modern times, the rule of Ivan Alexander inspired Bulgarian national writer <a href="Ivan%20Vazov">Ivan Vazov</a> to write the <a href="Novella">novelette</a> "Ivan-Aleksandǎr" and the <a href="drama">drama</a> "Kǎm propast" ("Towards an Abyss"), in both of which the tsar is the main character.

A piece of a garment signed by Ivan Alexander and interwoven with gold was discovered in a noble's grave near <a href="Pirot">Pirot</a> in the 1970s; today it is preserved in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Serbia">National Museum of Serbia</a> in <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>. It is the first find of its kind, demonstrating a medieval tradition attested in writing according to which Orthodox rulers would present their most eminent dignitaries with a piece of a garment they had worn.

<a href="Ivan%20Alexander%20Point">Ivan Alexander Point</a> on <a href="Nelson%20Island%20%28South%20Shetland%20Islands%29">Nelson Island</a> in the <a href="South%20Shetland%20Islands">South Shetland Islands</a>, <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> is named after Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria.

By his first wife Theodora of Wallachia (nun Teofana), a daughter of Basarab of Wallachia, Ivan Alexander had several children, including Ivan Sracimir, who ruled as emperor of Bulgaria in Vidin 1356–1397, associated emperors Michael Asen IV (co-ruled c. 1332–1354/5) and Ivan Asen IV (co-ruled 1337–1349).

By his second wife Sarah-Theodora, Ivan Alexander had several other children, which included Keraca Marija, who married the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos IV Palaiologos, Ivan Šišman, who succeeded as emperor of Bulgaria in Tǎrnovo 1371–1395, Ivan Asen V, associated as emperor of Bulgaria by 1359–1388?, a daughter called Thamar (Kera Tamara), who was married first to the "despotēs" Constantine (Konstantin), and then to Sultan <a href="Murad%20I">Murad I</a> of the Ottoman Empire, as well as two daughters named Desislava and Vasilisa.

United States v. Progressive, Inc.

United States of America v. Progressive, Inc., Erwin Knoll, Samuel Day, Jr., and Howard Morland, 467 <a href="F.%20Supp.">F. Supp.</a> 990 (<a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Western%20District%20of%20Wisconsin">W.D. Wis.</a> 1979), was a lawsuit brought against "<a href="The%20Progressive">The Progressive</a>" magazine by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> (DOE) in 1979. A temporary <a href="injunction">injunction</a> was granted against "The Progressive" to prevent the publication of an article by activist <a href="Howard%20Morland">Howard Morland</a> that purported to reveal the "secret" of the <a href="Thermonuclear%20weapon">hydrogen bomb</a>. Though the information had been compiled from publicly available sources, the DOE claimed that it fell under the "<a href="born%20secret">born secret</a>" clause of the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201954">Atomic Energy Act of 1954</a>.

Although the case was filed in the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself as a friend of the magazine. The case was therefore brought before Judge <a href="Robert%20W.%20Warren">Robert W. Warren</a>, a judge in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Wisconsin">Eastern District of Wisconsin</a>. Because of the sensitive nature of information at stake in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other "<a href="in%20camera">in camera</a>". The defendants, Morland and the editors of "The Progressive", would not accept <a href="security%20clearance">security clearance</a>s, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the "in camera" hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.

The article was eventually published after the government lawyers dropped their case during the appeals process, calling it moot after other information was independently published. Despite its indecisive conclusion, law students still study the case, which "could have been a law school hypothetical designed to test the limits of the presumption of <a href="constitutionality">unconstitutionality</a> attached to <a href="prior%20restraint">prior restraint</a>s".

The first atomic bombs were developed by the wartime <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. This was carried out in secret, lest its discovery induce the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a>, particularly Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects, or undertake covert operations against the project. The military and scientific leaders of the Manhattan Project anticipated a need to release details of their wartime accomplishments, principally as a form of recognition for the participants who had labored in secrecy. Press releases were prepared in advance of the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>, and an official account, known as the <a href="Smyth%20Report">Smyth Report</a> after its author, the physicist <a href="Henry%20DeWolf%20Smyth">Henry DeWolf Smyth</a>, was commissioned in April 1944 to provide a history of the project for public release. The Director of the Manhattan Project, <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Leslie%20Groves">Leslie Groves</a>, his scientific adviser, <a href="Richard%20C.%20Tolman">Richard Tolman</a>, and Smyth agreed that information could be publicly released if it was essential for an understanding of the project, or was already generally known or deducible, or had no significance to the production of atomic bombs. The first copies went on sale on August 12, 1945.

In its October 8, 1945, issue, "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>" took the position, emphasized with italics, that "": the knowledge of how to build an atomic bomb had been "the common property of scientists throughout the world for the last five years". <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> took a similar line in his first speech to Congress on nuclear matters that month, proclaiming that "the essential theoretical knowledge upon which the discovery is based is already widely known." In November 1945, Groves instructed Tolman to draw up a policy for the <a href="declassification">declassification</a> of the Manhattan Project's documents. Tolman assembled a committee, which took a list of the Manhattan Project's activities and assigned each a classification. Four reviewers assessed the documents and declassified about 500 of them by the end of the year.

If there was no secret, then there was no reason for security. The scientists, in particular, chafed under the wartime controls, which were not lifted with the surrender of Japan. On September 1, 1945, <a href="Samuel%20King%20Allison">Samuel K. Allison</a> used the occasion of the announcement of the founding of the <a href="Enrico%20Fermi%20Institute">Institute for Nuclear Studies</a> to call for freedom to research and develop atomic energy. He told the press that if controls were not removed, nuclear scientists might turn to the study of the color of butterfly wings. <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> warned that "unless research is free and outside of control, the United States will lose its superiority in scientific pursuit".

The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> envisaged that the Manhattan Project would be superseded by a <a href="statutory%20authority">statutory authority</a>. Legislation to create it was drafted by two War Department lawyers, <a href="Kenneth%20Claiborne%20Royall">Kenneth C. Royall</a> and <a href="William%20L.%20Marbury">William L. Marbury</a>. Their draft bill ran into strong opposition, particularly from the influential Senator <a href="Arthur%20H.%20Vandenberg">Arthur H. Vandenberg</a>. On December 20, 1945, Senator <a href="Brien%20McMahon">Brien McMahon</a> introduced an alternative bill on atomic energy, which quickly became known as the McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control. Section 10 assigned the patent for any invention related to atomic energy to the commission.

While the bill was being debated, the news broke on February 16, 1946, of the defection of <a href="Igor%20Gouzenko">Igor Gouzenko</a> in Canada, and the subsequent arrest of 22 people. The members of Congress debating the bill feared that "atomic secrets" were being systematically stolen by Soviet <a href="atomic%20spies">atomic spies</a>. McMahon convened an <a href="executive%20session">executive session</a> at which <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> Director <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="James%20F.%20Byrnes">James F. Byrnes</a> and Groves were called to appear. Groves revealed that the British physicist <a href="Alan%20Nunn%20May">Alan Nunn May</a> had passed information about the Manhattan Project to Soviet agents. The more conservative elements in Congress now moved to toughen the act. Section 10, which was formerly titled "Dissemination of Information", now became "Control of Information". Representative <a href="Helen%20Gahagan%20Douglas">Helen Gahagan Douglas</a>, who sponsored the McMahon bill in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House</a>, vigorously defended the section against counterarguments. She dismissed objections that it would "give away the secret of the bomb", asserting that America's advantage in nuclear weapons could only be temporary, whereas the bill could perpetuate the U.S. lead in scientific research. Truman signed the compromise bill into law as the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201946">Atomic Energy Act of 1946</a>. It established the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC) as the controlling body for atomic energy.

The Manhattan Project had been a <a href="wikt%3Acrash%23Adjective">crash</a> program to produce a nuclear weapon. Along the way, promising ideas had been set aside. <a href="Norris%20Bradbury">Norris Bradbury</a>, who replaced <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a> as director of the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> in late 1945, revived such projects in order to entice scientists to remain at, or return to, Los Alamos. One of these projects was the "Super", a nuclear weapon using <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a>, which <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>'s F-1 group had worked on under Fermi's direction. The technical problem was figuring out a way to get a fusion reaction to initiate and propagate, which required temperatures attainable only with a <a href="Nuclear%20weapon%20design%23Pure%20fission%20weapons">fission bomb</a>. The <a href="Fluid%20dynamics">hydrodynamic</a> calculations involved were daunting, and <a href="ENIAC">ENIAC</a> was used to run a computer simulation of the Super in December 1945 and January 1946.

The Polish mathematician <a href="Stanislaw%20Ulam">Stanislaw Ulam</a>, his wife Francoise Ulam, who performed the calculations, and their collaborator, Cornelius Everett, worked on the Super design through 1949. There was no push from the military for the weapon, because the AEC regarded it as too secret to inform either its own Military Liaison Committee or the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20Special%20Weapons%20Project">Armed Forces Special Weapons Project</a> about it. In September 1949, the Soviet Union <a href="RDS-1">detonated a nuclear device</a>. It fell to Oppenheimer, as chairman of the AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC), to decide whether the United States should develop the Super in response. The Super design used large quantities of tritium, which could only be manufactured in a reactor, and therefore at the expense of plutonium production for smaller weapons, so the GAC advised against it. Nonetheless, Truman approved the Super on January 31, 1950. Because of the secrecy surrounding the decision, accounts published in the 1950s incorrectly portrayed Oppenheimer as obstructing its development on political grounds, and this was a factor in the <a href="Oppenheimer%20security%20hearing">Oppenheimer security hearing</a> in 1954.

Ulam still only gave the design a "50–50 chance" of success in February 1950. At the end of March, he reported that it would not work at all. Scientists like <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a> and <a href="George%20Gamow">George Gamow</a> felt that Teller had committed the nation to an expensive crash program on the basis of a model that he knew was flawed. However, in February 1951, Ulam had a new idea, in which the shock wave from an atomic bomb "primary" stage, through an arrangement he called "hydrodynamic lensing", would compress a "secondary" stage of deuterium fusion fuel wrapped around a plutonium rod or "spark plug". On being informed, Teller immediately grasped the potential for using the <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s produced by the primary explosion for hydrodynamic lensing. This arrangement, which made <a href="thermonuclear%20weapon">thermonuclear weapon</a>s possible, is now known as the Teller–Ulam design. Although it was not what Truman had approved, the design did work, and was capable of producing multi-megaton explosions. "Rarely in the history of technology", wrote <a href="Howard%20Morland">Howard Morland</a>, "has such a seemingly daunting problem turned out to have such a nifty solution."

In 1950, the Atomic Energy Commission asked "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>" not to publish an article by Bethe that it claimed revealed classified information about the hydrogen bomb. "Scientific American" reluctantly agreed to stop the presses and make changes in the article, and to recall and burn the 3,000 copies that had already been printed. The 1951 arrest of <a href="Klaus%20Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a>, <a href="Harry%20Gold">Harry Gold</a>, <a href="David%20Greenglass">David Greenglass</a>, <a href="Morton%20Sobell">Morton Sobell</a> and <a href="Julius%20and%20Ethel%20Rosenberg">Julius and Ethel Rosenberg</a> who, according to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, "stole the basic secrets of nuclear fission", caused great concern. President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> denied the Rosenbergs clemency on the grounds that their actions "could well result in the deaths of many, many thousands of innocent citizens", and they were executed. After the Soviet Union detonated <a href="Joe%204">Joe 4</a> in August 1953, newspapers proclaimed that the Soviets had tested a hydrogen bomb. In fact it was only a boosted fission device, but the veil of secrecy covering the thermonuclear program prevented scientists from informing the public.

Prior restraint has generally been regarded by U.S. courts, particularly the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a>, as being "the most serious and least tolerable" of restrictions on the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a>. The <a href="Commentaries%20on%20the%20Laws%20of%20England">Blackstone Commentaries</a> defined <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press%20in%20the%20United%20States">freedom of the press</a> as "laying no restraints upon publication, and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published." The Supreme Court had however never held that prior restraint was <a href="Constitutionality">unconstitutional</a>. On the contrary, in "<a href="Near%20v.%20Minnesota">Near v. Minnesota</a>" 283 U.S. 697 (1931), <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Charles%20Evans%20Hughes">Charles E. Hughes</a> remarked that in wartime, "no one would question but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops." He further suggested that obscenity or incitement to insurrection would be similar grounds for prior restraint. The court subsequently upheld <a href="United%20States%20free%20speech%20exceptions">free speech exceptions</a> such as restrictions on demonstrations in "<a href="Cox%20v.%20New%20Hampshire">Cox v. New Hampshire</a>", 312 U.S. 569 (1941), and <a href="Censorship%20in%20the%20United%20States">censorship</a> of motion pictures in "Times Film Corp. v. City of Chicago", 365 U.S. 43 (1961).

In "<a href="New%20York%20Times%20Co.%20v.%20United%20States">New York Times Co. v. United States</a>" 403 U.S. 713 (1971)—better known as the <a href="Pentagon%20Papers">Pentagon Papers</a> case—the government had sought to prevent the publication of classified material by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". In this case, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 that the government had not reached the standard required by "Near" to justify prior restraint, but the concurring justices gave differing opinions about where the line should be drawn. In his opinion, Justice <a href="Potter%20Stewart">Potter Stewart</a> wrote that while publication of "The Pentagon Papers" would likely harm the national interest, it would not result in "direct, immediate or irreparable harm to our Nation or its people". Failure to provide a clear line inevitably meant that the court had to deal with prior restraint on a case-by-case basis. In "<a href="Nebraska%20Press%20Association%20v.%20Stuart">Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart</a>", 427 U.S. 539 (1976), the court was called upon to decide whether news reportage of a lurid mass murder case in a small town in Nebraska would justify prior restraint in order to protect the defendant's right to a fair trial. In this case, the court ruled unanimously that it would not. Most of the justices viewed "Near" as providing the only grounds for prior restraint, and declined to expand its scope any further.

"The Progressive" was a left-wing American monthly magazine of politics, culture and opinion with a circulation of around 40,000. In 1978, its managing editor, Sam Day Jr., a former editor of the "<a href="Bulletin%20of%20the%20Atomic%20Scientists">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</a>", and its editor, <a href="Erwin%20Knoll">Erwin Knoll</a>, commissioned freelance journalist <a href="Howard%20Morland">Howard Morland</a> to write an article on the secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons production in America. In October 1978, Morland got Representative <a href="Ron%20Dellums">Ronald V. Dellums</a> to submit a series of questions about plutonium production to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">Department of Energy</a> (DOE), the successor to the AEC. The DOE responded by classifying the questions. In September and October 1978, the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">House Armed Services Committee</a> held hearings on the proposed <a href="Comprehensive%20Nuclear-Test-Ban%20Treaty">Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty</a>. There was widespread public ignorance of issues surrounding nuclear weapons, and associated environmental concerns. Day and Morland hoped that by demystifying nuclear weapons, they would promote more critical public debate, and improve the prospects for nuclear disarmament. Morland claimed that "I am precisely the type of person the First Amendment was intended to protect: a political advocate whose ideas are unpopular with the general public and threatening to the government."

Over a period of six months, Morland systematically pieced together a design for a hydrogen bomb. He visited a number of nuclear weapons facilities and interviewed government employees, with the permission of the DOE, usually identifying himself and his purpose. He did not have a security clearance, and had never had any access to classified nuclear weapons documents, although it is possible that some classified information or ideas were accidentally or deliberately leaked to him. His scientific background was minimal; he had taken five undergraduate courses in physics and chemistry as part of his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in economics at <a href="Emory%20University">Emory University</a>. Morland identified the features of the Teller–Ulam design as staging, with a fission primary and a fusion secondary inside opposite ends of a hollow container, and the use of radiation from the exploding primary to compress, or implode, the secondary. "The notion that X-rays could move solid objects with the force of thousands of tons of dynamite," noted Morland, "was beyond the grasp of the science fiction writers of the time."

Day sent draft copies of Morland's article out to reviewers in late 1978 and early 1979, including Ron Siegel, a graduate student at <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. Siegel gave his draft copy to George Rathjens, a professor of political science there in February 1979. For many years, Rathjens had issued a challenge to his graduate students to produce a workable design for a hydrogen bomb, but no one had ever succeeded. Rathjens phoned "The Progressive" and urged that the article not be published. When the editors dismissed his suggestion, he sent the draft to the DOE. "Apparently," wrote Morland, "I had earned a passing grade on the Rathjens challenge".

In March 1979, the editors sent a final draft to the DOE for comment. DOE officials, first in phone calls and then in person, attempted to dissuade "The Progressive" from publishing the article on the grounds that it contained "secret <a href="restricted%20data">restricted data</a>" as defined by the Atomic Energy Act. "The Progressive" editors were not persuaded, and told the officials that they intended to proceed with publishing Morland's article. The DOE filed a <a href="motion%20to%20suppress">motion to suppress</a> the article with the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Western%20District%20of%20Wisconsin">United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin</a> in <a href="Madison%2C%20Wisconsin">Madison</a> on March 8, 1979. There was only one judge in the Western District of Wisconsin at the time, Judge <a href="James%20Edward%20Doyle">James Edward Doyle</a>, but he recused himself as a friend of the magazine. The case was therefore brought before Judge <a href="Robert%20W.%20Warren">Robert W. Warren</a>, a judge in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Wisconsin">Eastern District of Wisconsin</a>, and heard by Warren in <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>.
Lawyers for "The Progressive" voluntarily underwent security reviews and were granted <a href="Q%20clearance">Q clearance</a>s that allowed them to access restricted nuclear information. Morland and "The Progressive" editors declined to obtain clearances, as they would have had to sign non-disclosure agreements that would have prevented them from publishing the article. This resulted in the lawyers being restricted in their communications with their clients.

In seeking a <a href="Injunction">temporary restraining order</a>, government lawyers argued that "The Progressive" was about to break the law, causing <a href="Irreparable%20injury">irreparable harm</a>. The data in the article was <a href="Born%20secret">born classified</a>, so it did not matter that it was an original work of the author. They noted that prior restraint had been upheld by the courts before in matters of national security, and argued that the "Pentagon Papers" decision did not apply as the Atomic Energy Act specifically allowed for <a href="Injunction">injunctive relief</a>. Moreover, the Pentagon Papers were historical, whereas the hydrogen bomb was a current military weapon. Finally, they pointed out that the government had obligations under the <a href="Treaty%20on%20the%20Non-Proliferation%20of%20Nuclear%20Weapons">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</a> not to assist non-nuclear states in acquiring nuclear weapons. In granting the temporary restraining order on March 9, Warren said that he would have "to think long and hard before I gave the hydrogen bomb to <a href="Idi%20Amin">Idi Amin</a>."

<a href="James%20R.%20Schlesinger">James R. Schlesinger</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Energy">Secretary of Energy</a>, telephoned leading newspapers and warned them not to support "The Progressive". This was probably unnecessary, for the media were supportive of the government's case. <a href="Fred%20Graham%20%28correspondent%29">Fred Graham</a>, the "New York Times" legal correspondent, predicted that the government would win the case. In an editorial on March 11, 1979, "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" wrote that "The Progressive" case, "as a press-versus-government First Amendment contest, is <a href="John%20N.%20Mitchell">John Mitchell</a>'s dream case—the one the <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Nixon Administration</a> was never lucky enough to get: a real First Amendment loser." The newspaper called on "The Progressive" to "forget about publishing it". In the "Pentagon Papers" case, Professor <a href="Alexander%20Bickel">Alexander Bickel</a>, an expert on the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, when asked hypothetically if prior restraint could ever be justified, had told the court that he would draw the line at the hydrogen bomb. <a href="Daniel%20Ellsberg">Daniel Ellsberg</a>, who had leaked the Pentagon Papers, told Morland that he believed that nuclear weapon designs should be kept secret. Because of the horrific nature of thermonuclear weapons, and the expectation that "The Progressive" would probably lose the case, mainstream media organizations feared that the result would be an erosion of freedom of the press.

However, the court's role was to rule on whether publication was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping a temporary restraining order in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a <a href="preliminary%20injunction">preliminary injunction</a> one week after the March 9 temporary restraining order. On March 16, the Progressive's attorneys filed an affidavit from <a href="Theodore%20Postol">Theodore Postol</a>, an employee of the Department of Energy's <a href="Argonne%20National%20Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a>, stating that the information contained in the Morland article could be derived by any competent physicist from Teller's article on the hydrogen bomb in the "<a href="Encyclopedia%20Americana">Encyclopedia Americana</a>". At the request of both parties, the hearing was postponed to March 26 so they would have more time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the <a href="Federation%20of%20American%20Scientists">Federation of American Scientists</a> in its "<a href="amicus%20curiae">amicus curiae</a>" brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.

Testimony was introduced entirely in the form of sworn affidavits, the most important of which were deemed classified and presented to the court "<a href="in%20camera">in camera</a>". The government affiants included classification officers, weapon lab scientists, the Secretaries of Energy, State, and Defense, and Nobel physics laureate <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a>, whom Judge Warren cited as the star witness for the plaintiff. The defense side had no experts with direct knowledge of nuclear weapon design, until the unexpected appearance of <a href="Ray%20Kidder">Ray Kidder</a>, a nuclear weapon designer at the <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>. One of Kidder's jobs in 1962 had been to evaluate designs of the 29 thermonuclear devices tested in <a href="Operation%20Dominic">Operation Dominic</a>. Kidder was able to credibly dispute government arguments in the battle of affidavits, leveling the technical playing field. Because of the importance of <a href="radiation%20implosion">radiation implosion</a> in civilian fusion research, Kidder had been quietly waging a campaign to declassify it for some years prior to the Progressive case.

"The Progressive"s legal team argued that the government had not established a case sufficient "to overcome the First Amendment's presumption against prior restraint". The article was based upon information in the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a>, and was therefore neither a threat to national security nor covered by the Atomic Energy Act, which in any case did not authorize prior restraint, or was unconstitutional if it did. In this, counsel relied on the "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Heine">United States v. Heine</a>" decision, in which Judge <a href="Learned%20Hand">Learned Hand</a> ruled that information in the public domain could not be covered by the <a href="Espionage%20Act%20of%201917">Espionage Act of 1917</a>. The government's lawyers argued, on the contrary, that there was sensitive information in the article, which was not in the public domain, and which, if published, would harm arms control efforts.

In attempting to apply the "Near" and "Pentagon Papers" standards, the court was concerned about the prospect of publication causing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and potentially a global nuclear holocaust. The government did not go so far as to claim that publication might pose an immediate or inevitable danger, only that it "would substantially increase the risk that thermonuclear weapons would become available or available at an earlier date to those who do not now have them. If this should occur, it would undermine our nonproliferation policy, irreparably impair the <a href="national%20security%20of%20the%20United%20States">national security of the United States</a>, and pose a threat to the peace and security of the world." However, the court still found that "a mistake in ruling against the United States could pave the way for thermonuclear annihilation for us all. In that event, our right to life is extinguished and the right to publish becomes moot", and that publication could indeed cause "grave, direct, immediate and irreparable harm to the United States", thereby meeting the test the Supreme Court had enunciated in the "Pentagon Papers" case. The preliminary injunction was therefore granted.

Lawyers for "The Progressive" filed a <a href="motion%20to%20vacate">motion to vacate</a> the decision on the grounds that the information contained in Morland's article was already in the public domain. The basis for this claim was two reports from the <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> UCRL-4725, "Weapons Development During June 1956", and UCRL-5280, "Weapons Development During June 1958", which contained detailed information on thermonuclear weapon design. One of them, UCRL-4725, gave details about "Bassoon", a three-stage thermonuclear device tested during <a href="Operation%20Redwing">Operation Redwing</a> in 1956. It was found on the shelves of the Los Alamos library by Dmitri Rotow, a researcher for the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>. According to the government, the reports had been inadvertently declassified. On June 15, Warren therefore denied the motion on the grounds that such an error did not place the documents in the public domain. The appellants immediately appealed to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Seventh%20Circuit">Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals</a> in Chicago, claiming that the two documents had been on the shelves for a considerable period of time. The government now advanced the argument that "technical data" was not protected by the First Amendment. The motions for an expedited review were denied because the magazine's lawyers had waived that right—something Morland and "The Progressive" editors discovered only from the court. The preliminary injunction therefore remained in effect for six months.

On April 25, 1979, a group of scientists who worked at the <a href="Argonne%20National%20Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a> wrote to Senator <a href="John%20Glenn">John Glenn</a>, the Chairman of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and Federal Services. They were concerned about information being leaked, in particular by the government's tacit acknowledgement that Morland's bomb design was substantially correct, something that could not otherwise have been deduced from unclassified information. These included the affidavits by the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">United States Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Harold%20Brown%20%28Secretary%20of%20Defense%29">Harold Brown</a> and government expert witness Jack Rosengren. Copies of the letter were sent to major newspapers, but with a cover note explaining that it was for background information and not publication. After about four weeks, the Glenn subcommittee forwarded it to the DOE, which classified it.

Unaware of this, Hugh DeWitt, a physicist at the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons laboratory, forwarded a copy to <a href="Chuck%20Hansen">Chuck Hansen</a>. Hansen was a computer programmer from <a href="Mountain%20View%2C%20California">Mountain View, California</a>, who collected information about nuclear weapons as a hobby. He had run a competition to design an H-bomb, the winner of which would be the first person to have their design classified by the DOE. It now began to occur to him that his hobby might not be legal. On August 27, he wrote a letter to Senator <a href="Charles%20H.%20Percy">Charles H. Percy</a> detailing how much information he had deduced from publicly available sources. This included his own design, one not as good as Morland's, which Hansen had not seen. Hansen further charged that government scientists—including Edward Teller, <a href="Ted%20Taylor%20%28physicist%29">Ted Taylor</a>, and George Rathjens—had leaked sensitive information about thermonuclear weapons, for which no action had been taken. In this, Hansen was mistaken: Taylor had indeed been reprimanded, and Teller was not the source of the information that Hansen attributed to him. Hansen made copies of his letter available to several newspapers.

When "<a href="The%20Daily%20Californian">The Daily Californian</a>" (the student-run <a href="college%20newspaper">college newspaper</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California at Berkeley</a>), published excerpts from the Argonne letter on June 11, the DOE obtained a court order to prevent further publication. Undeterred, "The Daily Californian" published the Argonne letter in its entirety on June 13. In September, the DOE declared the Hansen letter to be classified and obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting "The Daily Californian" from publishing it, but the Hansen letter was published by the "<a href="Madison%20Press%20Connection">Madison Press Connection</a>" on September 16. The government then moved to dismiss their cases against both "The Progressive" and "The Daily Californian" as moot.

Morland's article was published in the November 1979 issue of "The Progressive". A month later he published an erratum in "The Progressive" with updates based on information that he had gathered during the trial from UCRL-4725, Chuck Hansen's letter and other sources. In Morland's opinion, the article contributed to a wave of anti-nuclear activism in the late 1970s and early 1980s that resulted in, amongst other things, the closure of the <a href="Rocky%20Flats%20Plant">Rocky Flats Plant</a> near Denver. Chuck Hansen went on to publish a book, "U.S. Nuclear Weapons: The Secret History", in 1988. This was subsequently expanded to a self-published five volume work entitled "Swords of Armageddon". However, many mainstream media organizations still remained reluctant to test the law by publishing. On September 30, 1980, the Justice Department issued a statement that it would not prosecute alleged violations of the Atomic Energy Act during the "Daily Californian" or "The Progressive" cases.

Hearings on the case were held by Glenn's subcommittee and by the House Subcommittee on Government Information and Individual Rights. The subcommittees looked into the implications of the decision with regards to nuclear proliferation. They also examined the doctrine of "classified at birth", but did not decide to amend the Atomic Energy Act to remove such provisions. As it turned out, fears of nuclear proliferation were unfounded. While over the course of the next 25 years some countries, such as Pakistan and North Korea, ultimately developed fission weapons, while others, such as Iraq and Libya, tried and failed, no other countries managed to develop thermonuclear weapons.

From a legal standpoint, the case "proved to be a victory for no one", due to the indecisive nature of its conclusion. Yet it remains a celebrated case nonetheless. In 2004, the 25th anniversary of the decision was commemorated with an academic conference at the <a href="Benjamin%20N.%20Cardozo%20School%20of%20Law">Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law</a>, attended by many of the participants, at which papers were presented. Law students still study the case, which "could have been a law school hypothetical designed to test the limits of the presumption of unconstitutionality attached to prior restraints."

Victoria Cross (Canada)

The <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> (VC) is the highest award of the <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom honours system</a>. It was previously awarded to Canada and other Commonwealth countries, most of which including Canada have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. Today, the Victoria Cross (), created in 1993 and named in honour of the British Victoria Cross is the highest award within the <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20Canada">Canadian honours system</a>, <a href="Canadian%20order%20of%20precedence%20%28decorations%20and%20medals%29">taking precedence over</a> all other orders, decorations, and medals. It is awarded by either the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Canada">Canadian monarch</a> or his or her <a href="Viceroy">viceregal</a> representative, the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of Canada</a>, to any member of the <a href="Canadian%20Forces">Canadian Forces</a> or allies serving under or with Canadian military command for extraordinary valour and devotion to duty while facing hostile forces. Whereas in many other <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> countries the relevant version of the Victoria Cross can only be awarded for actions against the enemy in a wartime setting, the <a href="Government%20of%20Canada">Canadian government</a> has a broader definition of the term "enemy". In Canada, the Victoria Cross can be awarded for action against armed mutineers, pirates, or other such hostile forces without war being officially declared. Recipients are entitled to use the <a href="post-nominal%20letters">post-nominal letters</a> "VC" (for both <a href="English%20language">English</a> and <a href="French%20language">French</a>) and also to receive an <a href="annuity%20%28finance%20theory%29">annuity</a> of <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>3,000. The decoration has not been awarded since its inception.

The original <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> was created by a <a href="Royal%20warrant%20%28document%29">Royal Warrant</a> issued on 29 January 1856 with the <a href="royal%20sign-manual">royal sign-manual</a> of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, and was intended to recognize demonstrations of gallantry during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>, regardless of either a man's social status or his record of service. Initially, the Victoria Cross could not be conferred on colonial troops, until Major <a href="Charles%20Heaphy">Charles Heaphy</a> received the medal for his actions while serving with a New Zealand militia unit in 1864. After this, the Victoria Cross was made available to all "local forces under imperial command." The cross could not be awarded posthumously but the policy was reversed in 1907.

Until 1972, 81 members of the Canadian military (including those from <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland</a>) and 13 Canadians serving in British units had been <a href="List%20of%20Canadian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">awarded the Victoria Cross</a>. After that date, however, the Canadian honours system was overhauled, and the Victoria Cross was eliminated from the official <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20Canada">list of honours</a>, instigating a decades-long debate on whether or not to reinstate the decoration. The <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">prime minister</a> at the time, <a href="Pierre%20Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a>, regularly dodged questions about the Victoria Cross, stating that "only Canadians should receive Canadian decorations." It was his successor, <a href="Brian%20Mulroney">Brian Mulroney</a>, who set up in 1987 a committee to look into the creation of a Canadian Victoria Cross as part of a new series of military honours. Although the committee did not recommend the Victoria Cross—names such as the "Canada Cross" and the "Cross of Military Valour" were put forward—the creation of a <a href="Victoria%20Cross%20for%20Australia">Victoria Cross for Australia</a> in 1991 and pressure from "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" and <a href="advocacy%20group">advocacy group</a>s, such as the <a href="Monarchist%20League%20of%20Canada">Monarchist League of Canada</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Legion">Royal Canadian Legion</a>, forced the plans to be amended. In 1991 a <a href="private%20member%27s%20bill">private member's bill</a> received <a href="List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Canada">all-party support</a> in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons</a>, following which the Victoria Cross, along with other Canadian military valour decorations, were on 31 December 1992 formally requested by Mulroney. The request was approved with the issue of <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> by Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> on 2 February of the following year, thereby ceasing Canadian dependence on the <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British honours system</a>.

The Victoria Cross is awarded for "the most conspicuous bravery, a daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty, in the presence of the enemy" at any point after 1 January 1993. It may be presented <a href="Posthumous%20recognition">posthumously</a>, and, like its British counterpart, can not be revoked. The main distinction between the Victoria Cross and the <a href="Cross%20of%20Valour%20%28Canada%29">Cross of Valour</a> is the specific reference to "the enemy", which the Canadian government has defined as a force hostile towards the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Canada">Canadian Crown</a>, including armed mutineers, rebels, rioters, and <a href="pirate">pirate</a>s. This means that the <a href="Queen-in-Council">Queen-in-Council</a> does not officially have to declare war to give acknowledgement of the existence of a hostile force that fits the official description. Thus, a Canadian serving as part of a <a href="peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a> operation is eligible to be awarded the Victoria Cross if the service member fulfils the above criteria.

In the case of a gallant and daring act having been performed by a squadron, ship's company, or detached body of individuals (such as a security detachment) in which all persons were deemed equally brave and deserving of the Victoria Cross, a ballot is to be drawn; the <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29%23Commissioned%20officers">commissioned</a> and <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29%23Non-commissioned%20officers">non-commissioned officers</a> each select one of their own, and the private soldiers or seamen select from amongst themselves two individuals. This provision with modification is included in the current warrant but has not been used since the First World War.
The process of awarding the Victoria Cross may take place in two ways: One is through a recommendation by the Decorations and Commendations Advisory Committee, which is a part of the <a href="Department%20of%20National%20Defence%20%28Canada%29">Department of National Defence</a> and has six members, one appointed by the governor general and the rest by the <a href="chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Staff%20%28Canada%29">chief of the Defence Staff</a>. Alternatively, a field commander can submit a name for consideration, though permission must be obtained from the governor general before the award can be presented. Recipients are entitled to receive an annuity from the federal <a href="Government%20of%20Canada">Canadian Crown</a>; per the Canadian gallantry awards order issued in January 2005, members of the Canadian Forces or those who joined the <a href="British%20Armed%20Forces">British forces</a> while domiciled in Canada or Newfoundland prior to 31 March 1949, after receiving the Victoria Cross, be granted <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>3,000 each year. Previously, Canadians who were posthumously awarded the British Victoria Cross were given special headstones at their burial sites in <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves</a> and other cemeteries.
To date, no Canadian Victoria Cross has been conferred; <a href="Ernest%20Smith">Smokey Smith</a>, who died in 2005, was the last Canadian recipient of the then pan-Commonwealth Victoria Cross, receiving it from King <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> in 1945. Prior to Queen Elizabeth II's re-dedication of the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Vimy%20Memorial">Vimy Memorial</a> on 7 April 2007, there was speculation she would present a Canadian Victoria Cross to her then-prime minister, <a href="Stephen%20Harper">Stephen Harper</a>, offering it in recognition of the gallantry of the <a href="Canadian%20Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier">Unknown Soldier</a>, as representative of all Canadian forces casualties of combat. The proposal was met with a mixed response from members of the Royal Canadian Legion and Canadian Forces, detractors feeling that the Unknown Soldier should not be elevated above his other fallen comrades. It had also been agreed at the time of the Unknown Soldier's repatriation that no award or decoration would be bestowed on the remains. No decision was taken about the awarding of the Canadian Victoria Cross to the Canadian Unknown Soldier.

Near the end of <a href="Canada%27s%20role%20in%20the%20Afghanistan%20War">Canada's role in the Afghanistan War</a>, concerns were raised about the stringency of the criteria that needed to be met to receive the Victoria Cross. Other countries with a Victoria Cross had awarded it numerous times since the end of the Second World War, some members of the Australian, New Zealand, and British armed forces receiving the decoration for their actions during the Afghan and Iraq wars of the 2000s. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces questioned why some actions by Canadians were deemed worthy only of the <a href="Star%20of%20Military%20Valour">Star of Military Valour</a>; citations for individuals who had received the imperial Victoria Cross during the First World War were very similar to those for Canadians who were presented with the Star of Military Valour during the war in Afghanistan. This led then Chief of the Defence Staff, <a href="Walter%20Natynczyk">Walter Natynczyk</a>, to create a special committee to review the matter. The Department of National Defence's Directorate of Honours and Recognition explained concepts of war had changed since the mid-20th century and Canada had also developed a more elaborate honours system.

The design of the Canadian medal is derived from that of the British original, which was the creation of <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Albert, Prince Consort</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Canadian%20monarchs%23List%20of%20royal%20consorts%20of%20Canada">royal consort</a> to Queen Victoria. Canada's Victoria Cross is thus a <a href="Cross%20patt%C3%A9e">cross "pattée"</a> with straight arms, across in each direction, and made out of <a href="bronze">bronze</a> coloured <a href="alloy">alloy</a>, the obverse bearing a lion crowned and statant guardant, similar to that which forms the <a href="Crest%20%28heraldry%29">crest</a> of the <a href="Arms%20of%20Canada">Royal Arms of Canada</a>, standing upon a representation of <a href="St%20Edward%27s%20Crown">St. Edward's Crown</a>, which itself rests above a semi-circular scroll. On the reverse is a raised circle for engraving the date of the act of gallantry along with the name, rank, and unit of the recipient. The medal is suspended from a link forming the letter "V" attached to a bar adorned on the front with <a href="Bay%20laurel">laurel</a> leaves, and on the reverse with the name, rank, and unit of the medal's recipient, all cast in the same metal as the medal. The ribbon, also wide, is solid <a href="crimson">crimson</a> in colour. <a href="Cathy%20Bursey-Sabourin">Cathy Bursey-Sabourin</a>, <a href="Fraser%20Herald">Fraser Herald</a> of the <a href="Canadian%20Heraldic%20Authority">Canadian Heraldic Authority</a>, and <a href="Bruce%20W.%20Beatty">Bruce W. Beatty</a>, however, made certain modifications for the Canadian Victoria Cross, the most notable being the inclusion of Canadian flora as decoration and the alteration of the inscription on the scroll from "FOR VALOUR" to the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> translation, "PRO VALORE", so as to accommodate <a href="Official%20bilingualism%20in%20Canada">Canada's two official languages</a>. In 2008, <a href="Citizens%20for%20a%20Canadian%20Republic">Citizens for a Canadian Republic</a>'s leader, Tom Freda, publicly objected to the decoration's name and appearance, with what he saw as its "objectionable colonial symbolism," royal iconography, and a shape offensive to Muslims and Jews.

With <a href="Canada%27s%20role%20in%20the%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan">Canada at war</a> for the first time since its version of the Victoria Cross was created, preparations for a physical cast of the medal were initiated in 2006, when a committee called the Victoria Cross Production Planning Group was formed under the leadership of the Chancellery of Honours at <a href="Rideau%20Hall">Rideau Hall</a>. It originally consisted of representatives from the <a href="Department%20of%20National%20Defence%20%28Canada%29">Department of National Defence</a>, <a href="Veterans%20Affairs%20Canada">Veterans Affairs Canada</a>, and the Office of the <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Secretary to the Governor General of Canada</a>, and the group later expanded to include individuals from the <a href="Department%20of%20Canadian%20Heritage">Department of Canadian Heritage</a>, <a href="Natural%20Resources%20Canada">Natural Resources Canada</a>, and the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mint">Royal Canadian Mint</a>, with assistance provided by the Queen and the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Ministry of Defence</a>. Following their research and deliberations, the first Victoria Cross decoration was struck in 2007, as confirmed by <a href="Herald%20Chancellor%20of%20Canada">Deputy Herald Chancellor</a> Emmanuelle Sajous, and the medal was officially released to the public on 16 May 2008 by Governor General <a href="Micha%C3%ABlle%20Jean">Michaëlle Jean</a> at Rideau Hall. It was one of 20 cast, each of which is composed of three groupings of metals: that of a <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian</a> cannon captured at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281854%E2%80%931855%29">siege of Sevastopol</a> (1854–1855), donated by Queen Elizabeth II; a Confederation Medal, created to mark <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Canada's confederation</a> in 1867; and a selection of metals from each of <a href="List%20of%20regions%20of%20Canada">Canada's regions</a>. These were <a href="Casting">cast</a>, rather than struck, continuing the tradition started in the United Kingdom when it was found the metal alloy was too brittle for striking, and finished at the Royal Canadian Mint. The first two were sent to <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> for addition to the British <a href="Royal%20Collection">Royal Collection</a> and other specimens were kept as part of the <a href="Crown%20Collection">Crown Collection</a> at Rideau Hall, as well as at the Department of National Defence, <a href="Library%20and%20Archives%20Canada">Library and Archives Canada</a>, and the <a href="Canadian%20War%20Museum">Canadian War Museum</a>.

As the apex of the <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20Canada">Canadian system of honours</a>, the Victoria Cross is to be worn before all other Canadian decorations and insignia of orders, including the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> and the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a>. It is worn as a medal, suspended from a medal bar on the left chest, unless protocol calls for a ribbon bar, which consists of a crimson ribbon with a miniature bronze Victoria Cross at its centre. Should an individual receive multiple awards of the Victoria Cross, additional bronze medal bars are added to the ribbon and further miniatures are placed evenly on the ribbon bar, reflecting the number of crosses the wearer has earned.

On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away

"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away" was among the best-selling songs of the 19th century, earning over $100,000 from <a href="sheet%20music">sheet-music</a> revenues. Written and composed by American songwriter <a href="Paul%20Dresser">Paul Dresser</a>, it was published by the <a href="Tin%20Pan%20Alley">Tin Pan Alley</a> firm of Howley, Haviland and Company in October 1897. The lyrics of the ballad reminisce about life near Dresser's childhood home by the <a href="Wabash%20River">Wabash River</a> in <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, United States. The song remained popular for decades, and the <a href="Indiana%20General%20Assembly">Indiana General Assembly</a> adopted it as the official <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20songs">state song</a> on March 14, 1913. The song was the basis for a <a href="On%20the%20Banks%20of%20the%20Wabash%20%281923%20film%29">1923 film of the same title</a>. Its longtime popularity led to the emergence of several lyrical versions, including an 1898 anti-war song and a <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a> version that was a number-one hit.

The song was composed during a transitory time in musical history when songs first began to be recorded for the <a href="phonograph">phonograph</a>. It was among the earliest pieces of popular music to be recorded. Dresser's inability to control the distribution of <a href="phonograph%20cylinders">phonograph cylinders</a> led him and his company to join other composers to petition the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> to expand federal copyright protections over the new technology.

Dresser's ballad was the subject of some controversy after his death in 1906. His younger brother, novelist <a href="Theodore%20Dreiser">Theodore Dreiser</a>, publicly claimed to have authored part of the song, but the validity of his claim was never proven. The ambiguity of <a href="United%20States%20copyright%20law">United States copyright law</a>s at the time and the poor management of Dresser's estate left the song vulnerable to plagiarism. The 1917 song "<a href="Back%20Home%20Again%20in%20Indiana">Back Home Again in Indiana</a>" borrowed heavily from Dresser's song, both lyrically and musically, and led to a dispute with Dresser's estate that was never resolved.

<a href="Paul%20Dresser">Paul Dresser</a>, a prominent 19th-century lyricist and music composer, was born in <a href="Terre%20Haute%2C%20Indiana">Terre Haute, Indiana</a>. Dresser's boyhood home was near land adjacent to the <a href="Wabash%20River">Wabash River</a>, the primary internal waterway in the <a href="U.S.%20state">state</a> of Indiana. He later became a traveling musician, comedian, and actor who also composing music for the acts. In 1893 Dresser joined Howley, Haviland and Company, a <a href="Tin%20Pan%20Alley">Tin Pan Alley</a> music publisher based in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, as a silent partner. In 1896, after more than twenty years of traveling the country as a performer, Dresser grew tired of the theater and turned his attention to composing music and his music publishing business. By that time Dresser was a nationally-known talent who had traveled throughout the United States. While he occasionally returned to Terre Haute for performances and brief visits, Dresser's songs and letters to his friends often reminisced about Indiana and his childhood home. In the first half of 1897 Dresser began to write the song "On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away" in remembrance of his Indiana home. He tended to compose songs over the course of months, usually in private during the evening hours. He refined his songs by playing the melody repeatedly, making changes and altering notes until it reached his satisfaction. It is believed that Dresser began "Wabash" in New York City in April 1897; continued working on it in May, when he was on vacation at <a href="West%20Baden%20Springs%2C%20Indiana">West Baden Springs, Indiana</a>; and completed the <a href="ballad">ballad</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, while staying at the <a href="Auditorium%20Building">Auditorium Hotel</a> in the summer of 1897. It is believed that the song's first public performance took place at the Alhambra Theater in <a href="Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>, probably in June 1897. After "professional copies" (printed samples of the sheet music) of the song were released in July, the final version was published in October as part of a series of "mother-and-home" songs.

Dresser officially dedicated the song to fourteen-year-old Mary South, a native of Terre Haute, whom he had never met. The second verse of "Wabash" contains reference to "Mary", but Dresser told a reporter that the name was "fictitious" and used only for "rhythmical purposes", and denied that the inspiration for the name came from a girl he once courted in his youth. When asked what led him to write the song Dresser said, "The same sweet memory that inspired that other <a href="Hoosier">Hoosier</a>, <a href="James%20Whitcomb%20Riley">James Whitcomb Riley</a>, to sing of the 'Old Swimmin' Hole' ... I was born on the banks of the Wabash at Terre Haute ... My fondest recollections are of my mother and of my early days along this stream."

To spur interest in the song, Howley, Haviland and Company, the song's publisher, distributed 5,000 copies of the sheet music to singers, musicians, theaters, and other musical venues in the month after the song was released. Restaurants, theaters, and street musicians were paid to play the song, while handbills with the lyrics were distributed when the song was performed publicly to help listeners to quickly learn the song. Using the nationwide network of music distribution controlled by Tin Pan Alley, Dresser's publishing company was able to have the song well advertised, which pushed sales on a large scale. "Wabash" became an immediate success. One Chicago department store claimed to have sold 1,471 copies of the song in a single day. In its first year, over 500,000 copies of sheet music for the song were sold.

Dresser's biographer, Clayton Henderson, attributed the success of the song to the "perfect marriage of words and music." An Indiana newspaper compared the song in popularity to "<a href="Old%20Folks%20at%20Home">Swanee River</a>" and wrote, "Mr. Dresser ... has endeavored to perpetuate the beauties of the Wabash as did <a href="Stephen%20Foster">Stephen Foster</a> that of the Suwannee River, and certainly no song since the latter has awakened so much interest among lovers of a good song, nor has any other American author seemed as capable of filling the void left vacant by Foster. The song is a gem and a welcome relief from some of the so-called popular songs sprung on the public from time to time."

One example attesting to the widespread popularity of Dresser's song occurred in June 1900, when the lighting failed at the <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a> arena during a <a href="prize%20fight">prize fight</a> between <a href="Terry%20McGovern%20%28boxer%29">Terry McGovern</a> and Tommy White. The announcer calmed the panicking crowd of 5,000 by whistling the tune of "On the Banks of the Wabash" and the crowd began to sing along in the dark until the lighting was repaired.

By the end of 1898 Dresser reported that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making "Wabash" a "sensation", the "great hit of the day." In a newspaper interview Dresser said, "I can't tell you just how much I have cleared off of the song, but the $50,000 estimate I have seen in some papers is very modest. You see I am a publisher as well as a composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words for all my songs, dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, write my own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. Now what do you think of that for a monopoly. Eh?" Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.

The music industry was in a period of transition at the time the song was published as new technologies allowed music to be recorded. U.S. copyright laws at the time did not allow music composers to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders or music rolls for <a href="player%20piano">player piano</a>s. <a href="Edison%20Records">Edison Records</a> paid popular singers like <a href="Harry%20Macdonough">Harry Macdonough</a> to sing the songs and then sold the recordings without paying any royalties to the composer or publisher of the music. Dresser joined with other prominent composers to seek a change in U.S. copyright laws. In 1902 Dresser met with U.S. senators and the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C. He also submitted papers with the U.S. State Department asking for an extension of copyright protection outside the United States, especially in Canada and England.

By 1900 "Wabash" had sold millions of copies, becoming the best selling song of its time in terms of sheet music sold. The ballad remained popular during the 1920s, becoming a staple song in many singing acts, including male <a href="quartet">quartet</a> performances. In addition, <a href="J.%20Stuart%20Blackton">J. Stuart Blackton</a> directed a 1923 <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> <a href="On%20the%20Banks%20of%20the%20Wabash%20%281923%20film%29">of the same title</a> that was based partially on the song's lyrics. The song was later featured prominently in the 1942 film "<a href="My%20Gal%20Sal">My Gal Sal</a>", the title of another song by Dresser.

<a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> included the song in a medley on his album '<a href="Join%20Bing%20and%20Sing%20Along">Join Bing and Sing Along</a>" (1959)

The ballad speaks of the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that occurred there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.

Without speaking directly of death, both verses indicate the absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.

The <a href="melody">melody</a> of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of <a href="harmony">harmonic</a> repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.

Written for piano, guitar, and <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>, the music begins in the key of <a href="G%20major">G major</a> with an "Andante Moderato" <a href="tempo">tempo</a>. The verses follow a chord progression of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to <a href="B%20minor">B minor</a>, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a "Andantino" tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and <a href="big%20band">big band</a>s.

A year after the song was published Dresser's brother <a href="Theodore%20Dreiser">Theodore</a>, who later became a famous <a href="novelist">novelist</a>, privately claimed to have authored its lyrics. In 1917, after Dresser's 1906 death, Theodore made his controversial claim public in a newspaper article. Already a controversial figure because of his open support for <a href="communism">communism</a> and tendency to make negative comments about his home state, Theodore's claims were ridiculed in many papers and by prominent <a href="Hoosier">Hoosier</a>s who dismissed it as a hoax. Although Theodore never retracted his assertion that he wrote the first verse and chorus of the song, he downplayed the importance of his alleged contribution in later years. It is possible that Theodore did give his brother the idea for the song, and may have even authored a portion of the lyrics, some of which reflect his writing style. The line stating "where I first received my lessons, nature's school" is a possible link, reflecting Theodore's obsession with nature during his youth and his belief that it held the answers to life, a topic he wrote of on several occasions.

Dresser died penniless after his publishing business failed. Known for his generosity, he also had a tendency to overspend and give money to his friends and family. In addition, copyrights to Dresser's music were poorly managed after the Haviland and Dresser Company went bankrupt in 1905. Maurice Richmond Music, who purchased the bankrupt company's copyrights, gave Ballard MacDonald and <a href="James%20F.%20Hanley">James Hanley</a> permission to use two <a href="Bar%20%28music%29">bars</a> from Dresser's ballad in a song they published in 1917. MacDonald and Hanley's "<a href="Back%20Home%20Again%20in%20Indiana">Back Home Again in Indiana</a>" has since eclipsed "On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away" in public use. Their song borrowed heavily from "On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away" in the chorus, both musically and lyrically, using far more than just the two bars granted to them.

Twenty-six bars from the last two lines of the chorus are copied almost identically. The lyrics of these same lines, "Through the <a href="Platanus%20occidentalis">sycamores</a> the candle lights are gleaming, On the banks of the Wabash, far away" is also borrowed from, and changed to "the gleaming candle lights, are still shining bright, through the sycamore trees". The first part of the chorus, "Oh the moonlight's fair tonight along the Wabash", is also reused and changed to "When I think about the moonlight on the Wabash, then I long for my Indiana home". Under Theodore's guidance, Dresser's estate accused Hanley of <a href="plagiarism">plagiarism</a> and threatened to bring a suit against Paull-Pioneer Music Corporation, the publisher of "Back Home Again in Indiana". Despite lengthy discussions, no action was ever taken to resolve the dispute, largely due to the ambiguous nature of U.S. copyright laws in the early 20th century and the estate's lack of finances.

On March 14, 1913, the <a href="Indiana%20General%20Assembly">Indiana General Assembly</a> adopted "On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away" as the official state song. The song's lyrics and required uses were added to the <a href="Indiana%20Code">Indiana Code</a>. The state song was the first <a href="List%20of%20Indiana%20state%20symbols">official symbol of Indiana</a>, adopted four years before the <a href="Flag%20of%20Indiana">state flag</a>. In 1925 Indiana General Assembly passed legislation that required Indiana's public school teachers to teach the song as part of their curriculum. That same year the "New York Times" reported that 20,000 copies of the song were distributed to the state's public school teachers. The song is often played at major sporting events, including the Indianapolis 500.

Although "On the Banks of Wabash, Far Away" is Indiana's official song, "Back Home Again in Indiana" is more widely used and is falsely believed by many to be the state song. One of the leading causes of the state song's fall into obscurity was a change in its use at the <a href="Indianapolis%20500">Indianapolis 500</a> during the 1940s. "On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away" is played at the event as the race cars move into their starting positions, a period that receives little television coverage, while "Back Home Again in Indiana" is sung just before the start of the race and is broadcast publicly. The change to singing "Back Home Again in Indiana" at public events continued in the following years, and it is often played in the place of "On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away" at state college football games and other prominent events. In 1997, to commemorate the song's centennial anniversary, the Indiana General Assembly passed a resolution reconfirming "On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away" as the state's official song and urged state institutions to make more use of it and return it to popularity.

in 1898 <a href="Andrew%20B.%20Sterling">Andrew B. Sterling</a> wrote a folk adaptation of the song about the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>, entitled "On the Shores of Havana, Far Away". The lyrics consisted of a verse lamenting the dead from the explosion of the <a href="USS%20Maine%20%28ACR-1%29">USS "Maine"</a>, a second hoping to avoid the draft, and a third criticizing and ridiculing the war. The chorus expressed sorrow for soldiers who had to occupy <a href="Havana">Havana</a> and those who died in the war. Howley, Haviland and Company published the song, giving Sterling credit for the words, but paying royalties to Dresser for use of the melody.

In 1914 <a href="Karl-Ewert%20Christenson">Karl-Ewert Christenson</a> wrote Swedish-language lyrics to the melody of Dresser's song. Christenson titled the new song "Barndomshemmet" ("The Childhood Home"). The Swedish lyrics describe <a href="Swedish%20emigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">emigration from Sweden to the United States</a> and was made popular by <a href="cabaret">cabaret</a> and revue artist <a href="Ernst%20Rolf">Ernst Rolf</a>, who had one of his first major hits with the song. A 1970 version of "Barndomshemmet" sung by Dan Eriksson reached number one on <a href="Svensktoppen">Svensktoppen</a>, the Swedish hit list.

Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway

The Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&HR), also known as the Hampstead Tube, was a railway company established in 1891 that constructed a deep-level underground "tube" railway in London. Construction of the CCE&HR was delayed for more than a decade while funding was sought. In 1900 it became a subsidiary of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Electric Railways Company of London</a> (UERL), controlled by American financier <a href="Charles%20Yerkes">Charles Yerkes</a>. The UERL quickly raised the funds, mainly from foreign investors. Various routes were planned, but a number of these were rejected by Parliament. Plans for tunnels under <a href="Hampstead%20Heath">Hampstead Heath</a> were authorised, despite opposition by many local residents who believed they would damage the <a href="ecology">ecology</a> of the Heath.

When opened in 1907, the CCE&HR's line served 16 stations and ran for in a pair of tunnels between its southern terminus at <a href="Charing%20Cross">Charing Cross</a> and its two northern termini at <a href="Archway%2C%20London">Archway</a> and <a href="Golders%20Green">Golders Green</a>. Extensions in 1914 and the mid-1920s took the railway to <a href="Edgware">Edgware</a> and under the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> to <a href="Kennington">Kennington</a>, serving 23 stations over a distance of . In the 1920s the route was connected to another of London's deep-level tube railways, the <a href="City%20and%20South%20London%20Railway">City and South London Railway</a> (C&SLR), and services on the two lines were merged into a single <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> line, eventually called the <a href="Northern%20line">Northern line</a>.

Within the first year of opening, it became apparent to the management and investors that the estimated passenger numbers for the CCE&HR and the other UERL lines had been over-optimistic. Despite improved integration and cooperation with the other tube railways, and the later extensions, the CCE&HR struggled financially. In 1933 the CCE&HR and the rest of the UERL were taken into <a href="public%20ownership">public ownership</a>. Today, the CCE&HR's tunnels and stations form the Northern line's Charing Cross branch from Kennington to Camden Town, the Edgware branch from Camden Town to Edgware, and the High Barnet branch from Camden Town to Archway.

In November 1891, notice was given of a <a href="Local%20and%20Personal%20Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">private bill</a> that would be presented to <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> for the construction of the Hampstead, St Pancras & Charing Cross Railway (HStP&CCR). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Heath Street in <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a> to <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a> in Charing Cross. The route was to run beneath Hampstead High Street, <a href="Rosslyn%20Hill">Rosslyn Hill</a>, Haverstock Hill and <a href="Chalk%20Farm%20Road">Chalk Farm Road</a> to <a href="Camden%20Town">Camden Town</a> and then under <a href="Camden%20High%20Street">Camden High Street</a> and Hampstead Road to <a href="Euston%20Road">Euston Road</a>. The route then continued south, following <a href="Tottenham%20Court%20Road">Tottenham Court Road</a>, <a href="Charing%20Cross%20Road">Charing Cross Road</a> and King William Street (now William IV Street) to Agar Street adjacent to Strand. North of Euston Road, a branch was to run eastwards from the main alignment under <a href="Drummond%20Street%2C%20London">Drummond Street</a> to serve the main line stations at <a href="Euston%20railway%20station">Euston</a>, <a href="St%20Pancras%20railway%20station">St Pancras</a> and <a href="London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station">King's Cross</a>. Stations were planned at Hampstead, <a href="Belsize%20Park">Belsize Park</a>, <a href="Chalk%20Farm">Chalk Farm</a>, <a href="Camden%20Town">Camden Town</a>, Seymour Street (now part of Eversholt Street), Euston Road, Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street, Agar Street, Euston and King's Cross. Although a decision had not been made between the use of cable haulage or electric traction as the means of pulling the trains, a power station was planned on Chalk Farm Road close to the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a>'s <a href="Primrose%20Hill%20railway%20station">Chalk Farm station</a> (later renamed Primrose Hill) which had a coal depot for deliveries.

The promoters of the HStP&CCR were inspired by the recent success of the City and South London Railway (C&SLR), the world's first deep-tube railway. This had opened in November 1890 and had seen large passenger numbers in its first year of operation. Bills for three similarly inspired new underground railways were also submitted to Parliament for the 1892 <a href="legislative%20session">legislative session</a>, and, to ensure a consistent approach, a <a href="Parliamentary%20Select%20Committees%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Joint Select Committee</a> was established to review the proposals. The committee took evidence on various matters regarding the construction and operation of deep-tube railways, and made recommendations on the diameter of tube tunnels, method of traction, and the granting of <a href="easement">wayleaves</a>. After preventing the construction of the branch beyond Euston, the Committee allowed the HStP&CCR bill to proceed for normal parliamentary consideration. The rest of the route was approved and, following a change of the company name, the bill received <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> on 24 August 1893 as the "Charing Cross, Euston, and Hampstead Railway Act, 1893".

Although the company had permission to construct the railway, it still had to raise the <a href="Financial%20capital">capital</a> for the construction works. The CCE&HR was not alone; four other new tube railway companies were looking for investors – the <a href="Baker%20Street%20and%20Waterloo%20Railway">Baker Street & Waterloo Railway</a> (BS&WR), the <a href="Waterloo%20%26amp%3B%20City%20line">Waterloo & City Railway</a> (W&CR) and the <a href="Great%20Northern%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Railway">Great Northern & City Railway</a> (GN&CR) (the three other companies that put forward bills in 1892) and the <a href="Central%20London%20Railway">Central London Railway</a> (CLR, which had received assent in 1891). Only the W&CR, which was the shortest line and was backed by the <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">London and South Western Railway</a> with a guaranteed <a href="dividend">dividend</a>, was able to raise its funds without difficulty. For the CCE&HR and the rest, much of the remainder of the decade saw a struggle to find investors in an uninterested market. A share offer in April 1894 had been unsuccessful and in December 1899 only 451 out of the company's 177,600 £10 shares had been part sold to eight investors.
Like most legislation of its kind, the act of 1893 imposed a time limit for the <a href="Eminent%20domain">compulsory purchase</a> of land and the raising of capital. To keep the powers granted by the act alive, the CCE&HR submitted a series of further bills to Parliament for extensions of time. Extensions were granted by the "Charing Cross Euston and Hampstead Railway Acts, 1897", "1898", "1900", and "1902".

A contractor was appointed in 1897, but funds were not available and no work was started. In 1900, foreign investors came to the rescue of the CCE&HR: American financier Charles Yerkes, who had been lucratively involved in the development of Chicago's <a href="tram">tram</a>way system in the 1880s and 1890s, saw the opportunity to make similar investments in London. Starting with the purchase of the CCE&HR in September 1900 for £100,000, he and his backers purchased a number of the unbuilt tube railways, and the operational but struggling <a href="District%20Railway">Metropolitan District Railway</a> (MDR).

With the CCE&HR and the other companies under his control, Yerkes established the UERL to raise funds to build the tube railways and to <a href="electrification">electrify</a> the steam-operated MDR. The UERL was <a href="Market%20capitalization">capitalised</a> at £5 million with the majority of <a href="Share%20%28finance%29">shares</a> sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which raised a total of £18 million (equivalent to approximately £ today) to be used across all of the UERL's projects.

While the CCE&HR raised money, it continued to develop the plans for its route. On 24 November 1894, a bill was announced to purchase additional land for stations at Charing Cross, Oxford Street, Euston and Camden Town. This was approved as the "Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1894" on 20 July 1895. On 23 November 1897, a bill was announced to change the route of the line at its southern end to terminate under Craven Street on the south side of Strand. This was enacted as the "Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1898" on 25 July 1898.

On 22 November 1898, the CCE&HR published another bill to add an extension and to modify part of the route. The extension was a branch from Camden Town to <a href="Kentish%20Town">Kentish Town</a> where a new terminus was planned as an interchange with the <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a>'s <a href="Kentish%20Town%20station">Kentish Town station</a>. Beyond the terminus, the CCE&HR line was to come to the surface for a depot on vacant land to the east of Highgate Road (occupied today by the Ingestre Road Estate). The modification changed the Euston branch by extending it northwards from Euston to connect to the main route at the south end of Camden High Street. The section of the main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted. Included in the bill were powers to purchase a site in Cranbourn Street for an additional station (<a href="Leicester%20Square%20tube%20station">Leicester Square</a>). It received <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> as the "Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1899" on 9 August 1899.

On 23 November 1900, the CCE&HR announced its most wide-ranging modifications to the route. Two bills were submitted to Parliament, referred to as No. 1 and No. 2. Bill No. 1 proposed the continuation of the railway north from Hampstead to <a href="Golders%20Green">Golders Green</a>, the purchase of land and properties for stations and the construction of a depot at Golders Green. Also proposed were minor adjustments to route alignments previously approved. Bill No. 2 proposed two extensions: from Kentish Town to Brecknock Road, <a href="Archway%2C%20London">Archway Tavern</a>, <a href="A1%20in%20London%23Haringey">Archway Road</a> and <a href="Highgate">Highgate</a> in the north and from Charing Cross to <a href="Parliament%20Square">Parliament Square</a>, Artillery Row and <a href="London%20Victoria%20station">Victoria station</a> in the south.

The extension to Golders Green would take the railway out of the urban and <a href="suburb">suburb</a>an areas and into open farmland. While this provided a convenient site for the CCE&HR's depot it is believed that underlying the decision was Yerkes' plan to profit from the sale of development land previously purchased in the area that would rise in value when the railway opened.

The CCE&HR's two bills were submitted to Parliament at the same time as a large number of other bills for underground railways in the capital. As it had done in 1892, Parliament established a joint committee under <a href="Robert%20Windsor-Clive%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Plymouth">Lord Windsor</a> to review the bills. By the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session. Bills No. 1 and No. 2 were resubmitted in November 1901 together with a new bill – bill No. 3. The new bill modified the route of the proposed extension to Golders Green and added a short extension running beneath Charing Cross main line station to the <a href="Victoria%20Embankment">Victoria Embankment</a> where it would provide an interchange with the existing <a href="Embankment%20tube%20station">MDR station</a> (then called Charing Cross).
The bills were again examined by a joint committee, this time under <a href="Thomas%20Lister%2C%204th%20Baron%20Ribblesdale">Lord Ribblesdale</a>. The sections which dealt with the proposed north-eastern extension from Archway Tavern to Highgate and the southern extension from Charing Cross to Victoria were deemed to not comply with parliamentary <a href="rules%20of%20order">standing orders</a> and were struck-out.

A controversial element of the CCE&HR's plans was the extension of the railway to Golders Green. The route of the tube tunnels took the line under <a href="Hampstead%20Heath">Hampstead Heath</a> and strong opposition was raised, concerned about the effect that the tunnels would have on the ecology of the Heath. The Hampstead Heath Protection Society claimed that the tunnels would drain the sub-soil of water and the vibration of passing trains would damage trees. Taking its lead from the Society's objections, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" published an alarmist article on 25 December 1900 claiming that "a great tube laid under the heath will, of course, act as a drain; and it is quite likely that the grass and gorse and trees on the Heath will suffer from the loss of moisture ... Moreover, it seems to be established beyond question that the trains passing along these deep-laid tubes shake the earth to its surface, and the constant jar and quiver will probably have a serious effect upon the trees by loosening their roots."

In fact, the tunnels were to be excavated at a depth of more than below the surface, the deepest of any on the London Underground. In his presentation to the joint committee, the CCE&HR's <a href="counsel">counsel</a> disparagingly refuted the objections: "Just see what an absurd thing! Disturbance of the water when we are 240 feet down in the London clay – about the most impervious thing you can possibly find; almost more impervious than granite rock! And the vibration on this railway is to shake down timber trees! Could anything be more ludicrous than to waste the time of the Committee in discussing such things presented by such a body!"

A second railway company, the Edgware & Hampstead Railway (E&HR), also had a bill before Parliament which proposed tunnels beneath the Heath as part of its planned route between Edgware and Hampstead. The E&HR had planned to connect to the CCE&HR at Hampstead but, to avoid the needless duplication of tunnels between Golders Green and Hampstead, the two companies agreed that the E&HR would instead connect to the CCE&HR at Golders Green.

The <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Hampstead">Metropolitan Borough of Hampstead</a> had initially objected to the line but gave consent on the condition that a station be constructed between Hampstead and Golders Green to provide access for visitors to the Heath. A new station was added to the plans at the northern edge of the Heath at North End where it could also serve a new residential development planned for the area. Once Parliament was satisfied that the extension would not damage the Heath, the CCE&HR bills jointly received royal assent on 18 November 1902 as the "Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1902". On the same date, the E&HR bill received its assent as the "Edgware and Hampstead Railway Act, 1902".

With the funds available from the UERL and the route decided, the CCE&HR started site demolitions and preparatory works in July 1902. On 21 November 1902, the CCE&HR published another bill which sought compulsory purchase powers for additional buildings for its station sites, planned the take-over of the E&HR and abandoned the permitted but redundant section of the line from Kentish Town to the proposed depot site near Highgate Road. This bill was approved as the "Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1903" on 21 July 1903.

<a href="Tunnelling%20shield">Tunnelling</a> began in September 1903. Stations were provided with surface buildings designed by architect <a href="Leslie%20Green">Leslie Green</a> in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed <a href="glazed%20architectural%20terracotta">terracotta</a> blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. Each station was provided with two or four <a href="elevator">lifts</a> and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft.

While construction proceeded, the CCE&HR continued to submit bills to Parliament. The "Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1904", which received assent on 22 July 1904, granted permission to buy additional land for the station at Tottenham Court Road, for a new station at Mornington Crescent and for changes at Charing Cross. The "Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1905" received assent on 4 August 1905. It dealt mainly with the acquisition of the subsoil under part of the forecourt of the <a href="South%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">South Eastern Railway's</a> Charing Cross station so that the CCE&HR's station could be excavated during the 3 months closure following the recent <a href="Charing%20Cross%20roof%20collapse">roof collapse</a>.

The sale of the building land at North End to <a href="Conservation%20movement">conservationists</a> to form the <a href="Hampstead%20Heath%23Extension">Hampstead Heath extension</a> in 1904, meant a reduction in the number of residents who might use the station there. Work continued below ground at a reduced pace, and the platform tunnels and some passenger circulation tunnels were excavated, but North End station was abandoned in 1906 before the lift and stair shafts were dug and before a surface building was constructed.

Tunnelling was completed in December 1905, after which work continued on the construction of the station buildings and the fitting-out of the tunnels with tracks and signalling equipment. As part of the UERL group, the CCE&HR obtained its electricity from the company's <a href="Lots%20Road%20Power%20Station">Lots Road Power Station</a>, originally built for the electrification of the MDR; the proposed Chalk Farm generating station was not built. The final section of the approved route between Charing Cross and the Embankment was not constructed, and the southern terminus on opening was Charing Cross. After a period of test running, the railway was ready to open in 1907.

The CCE&HR was the last of the UERL's three tube railways to open and was advertised as the "Last Link". The official opening on 22 June 1907 was made by <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>, <a href="President%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Trade">President of the Board of Trade</a>, after which the public travelled free for the rest of the day. From its opening, the CCE&HR was generally known by the abbreviated names "Hampstead Tube" or "Hampstead Railway" and the names appeared on the station buildings and on contemporary maps of the tube lines.

The railway had stations at:
Golders Green branch
Highgate branch

The service was provided by a fleet of <a href="Passenger%20car%20%28rail%29%23Coach">carriages</a> manufactured for the UERL by the <a href="American%20Car%20and%20Foundry%20Company">American Car and Foundry Company</a> and assembled at <a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a> in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. These carriages were built to the same design used for the BS&WR and the GNP&BR and operated as <a href="electric%20multiple%20unit">electric multiple unit</a> trains without the need for separate locomotives. Passengers boarded the trains via folding lattice gates at each end of cars which were operated by Gate-men who rode on the outside platform and announced station names as trains arrived. The design became known on the Underground as the <a href="London%20Underground%201906%20Stock">1906 stock</a> or <a href="London%20Underground%201906%20Stock">Gate stock</a>.

Despite the UERL's success in financing and constructing the Hampstead Railway in only seven years, its opening was not the financial success that had been expected. In the Hampstead Tube's first twelve months of operation it carried 25 million passengers, just half of the 50 million that had been predicted during the planning of the line. The UERL's pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers for its other new lines proved to be greatly over-optimistic, as did the improvement in passenger numbers expected on the newly electrified MDR – in each case achieving only around fifty per cent of their targets.

The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly due to competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took a large number of passengers away from the trains. The problem was not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface MDR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to a degree and the reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.

In an effort to improve the financial situation, the UERL together with the C&SLR, the CLR and the GN&CR began, from 1907, to introduce fare agreements. From 1908, they began to present themselves through common branding as the "Underground". The W&CR was the only tube railway that did not participate in the arrangement as it was owned by the mainline London and South Western Railway.

The UERL's three tube railway companies were still legally separate entities with their own management and shareholder and dividend structures. There was duplicated administration between the three companies and, to streamline the management and reduce expenditure, the UERL announced a bill in November 1909 that would merge the Hampstead Tube, the Piccadilly Tube and the Bakerloo Tube into a single entity, the <a href="London%20Electric%20Railway">London Electric Railway</a> (LER), although the lines retained their own individual branding. The bill received assent on 26 July 1910 as the "London Electric Railway Amalgamation Act, 1910".

In November 1910, the LER published notice of a bill to revive the unused 1902 permission to continue the line from Charing Cross to Embankment. The extension was planned as a single tunnel, running in a loop under the Thames, connecting the ends of the two existing tunnels. Trains were to run in one direction around the loop stopping at a single-platform station constructed to provide an interchange with the BS&WR and MDR at Embankment station. The bill received assent as the "London Electric Railway Act, 1911" on 2 June 1911. The loop was constructed from a large excavation north-west of the MDR station and was connected to the sub-surface line with escalators. The station opened on 6 April 1914 as:

In the decade after the E&HR received royal assent for its route from Edgware to Hampstead, the company continued to search for finance and revised its plans in conjunction both with the CCE&HR and a third railway company, the <a href="Watford%20and%20Edgware%20Railway">Watford & Edgware Railway</a> (W&ER) which had plans to build a line linking the E&HR to <a href="Watford">Watford</a>.

Following the enactment of the "Watford and Edgware Railway Act, 1906", the W&ER briefly took over the powers of the E&HR to construct the line from Golders Green to Edgware. Struggling to find funds, the W&ER attempted a formal merger with the E&HR through a bill submitted to Parliament in 1906, with the intention of constructing and operating the whole of the route from Golders Green to Watford as a <a href="light%20railway">light railway</a> but the bill was rejected by Parliament and, when the W&ER's powers lapsed, control returned to the CCE&HR.

The E&HR company had remained in existence and had obtained a series of acts to preserve and develop its plans. The "Edgware and Hampstead Railway Acts, 1905", "1909" and "1912" granted extensions of time, approved changes to the route, gave permissions for viaducts and a tunnel and allowed the closure and re-routeing of roads to be crossed by the railway's tracks. It was intended that the CCE&HR would provide and operate the trains and this was formalised by the "London Electric Railway Act, 1912", which approved the LER's take over of the E&HR.

No immediate effort was made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> started. With wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E&HR acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a final date by which compulsory purchases had to be made of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the company could not cover the cost of repaying loans.
The project was made possible when the government introduced the <a href="Trade%20Facilities%20Act%201921">Trade Facilities Act 1921</a> by which the <a href="HM%20Treasury">Treasury</a> <a href="underwriting">underwrote</a> loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment. With this support, the UERL raised the funds and work began on extending the Hampstead tube to Edgware. The UERL group's Managing Director/Chairman, <a href="Albert%20Stanley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ashfield">Lord Ashfield</a>, ceremonially cut the first sod to begin the works at Golders Green on 12 June 1922.

The extension crossed farmland, meaning it could be constructed on the surface more easily and cheaply than a deep tube line below the surface. A viaduct was constructed across the <a href="River%20Brent">Brent</a> valley and a short section of tunnel was required at <a href="The%20Hyde">The Hyde</a>, <a href="Hendon">Hendon</a>. Stations were designed in a suburban pavilion style by the UERL's architect <a href="Stanley%20Heaps">Stanley Heaps</a>. The first section opened on 19 November 1923 with stations at:


The remainder of the extension opened on 18 August 1924 with stations at:

On 21 November 1922, the LER announced a bill for the 1923 parliamentary session. It included the proposal to extend the line from its southern terminus to the C&SLR's station at <a href="Kennington%20tube%20station">Kennington</a> where an interchange would be provided. The bill received royal assent as the "London Electric Railway Act, 1923" on 2 August 1923.

The work involved the rebuilding of the below ground parts of the CCE&HR's former terminus station to enable through running and the loop tunnel was abandoned. Tunnels were extended under the Thames to <a href="Waterloo%20tube%20station">Waterloo station</a> and then to Kennington where two additional platforms were constructed to provide the interchange to the C&SLR. Immediately south of Kennington station, the CCE&HR tunnels connected to those of the C&SLR. The new service was opened on 13 September 1926 to coincide with the opening of the extension of the C&SLR to <a href="Morden%20tube%20station">Morden</a>. The Charing Cross to Kennington link had stations at:

The C&SLR had been under the control of the UERL since its purchase by the group in 1913. An earlier connection between the CCE&HR and the C&SLR had been opened in 1924 linking the C&SLR's station at Euston with the CCE&HR's at Camden Town. With the opening of the Kennington extension, the two railways began to operate as an integrated service using the newly built <a href="London%20Underground%20Standard%20Stock">Standard Stock</a> trains. On <a href="tube%20map">tube map</a>s the combined lines were shown in a single colour although the separate names continued in use into the 1930s.

Despite improvements made to other parts of the network, the Underground railways were still struggling to make a profit. The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable <a href="London%20General%20Omnibus%20Company">London General Omnibus Company</a> (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of revenues, to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole UERL group.

In an effort to protect the UERL group's income Lord Ashfield <a href="lobbying">lobbied</a> the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a>lor (later <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom">MP</a> and <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Transport%23Minister%20of%20Transport%20%281919%E2%80%931941%29">Minister of Transport</a>) <a href="Herbert%20Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a>, at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the <a href="London%20County%20Council">LCC's</a> tram system; Morrison preferred full public ownership. After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB), a public corporation that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board%23London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Area">London Passenger Transport Area</a>. The Board was a compromise – public ownership but not full <a href="nationalization">nationalisation</a> – and came into existence on 1 July 1933. On this date, the LER and the other Underground companies were <a href="liquidation">liquidated</a>.

Finding a suitable name for the combined CCE&HR and C&SLR routes proved a challenge for the LPTB and a number of variations were used including "Edgware, Morden & Highgate Line" in 1933 and "Morden-Edgware Line" in 1936. In 1937, "Northern line" was adopted in preparation for the uncompleted <a href="Northern%20line%23The%20Northern%20Heights%20plan">Northern Heights plan</a>. Today, the Northern line is the busiest on the London Underground system, carrying 206.7 million passengers annually, a level of usage which led it to be known as the "Misery line" during the 1990s due to overcrowding and poor reliability.

Battle of San Patricio

The Battle of San Patricio was fought on February 27, 1836, between <a href="Centralist%20Republic%20of%20Mexico">Mexican</a> troops and rebellious immigrants from the <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Mexican province of Texas</a>, known as <a href="Texians">Texians</a>. The battle marked the start of the <a href="Goliad%20Campaign">Goliad Campaign</a>, the Mexican offensive to retake the Texas <a href="Gulf%20Coast">Gulf Coast</a>. It took place in and around <a href="San%20Patricio%2C%20Texas">San Patricio</a>.

By the end of 1835, all Mexican troops had been driven from Texas. <a href="Frank%20W.%20Johnson">Frank W. Johnson</a>, the commander of the volunteer army in Texas, and <a href="James%20Grant%20%28Texas%29">James Grant</a> gathered volunteers for a planned invasion of the Mexican port town of <a href="Matamoros%2C%20Tamaulipas">Matamoros</a>. After spending several weeks gathering horses for the <a href="Matamoros%20Expedition">Matamoros Expedition</a>, in late February, Johnson and about 40 men led the herd to San Patricio. Johnson assigned some of his troops to a ranch outside town to guard the horses, while the rest of his men garrisoned in three different locations in town.

Unbeknownst to the Texians, on February 18 Mexican General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Urrea">José de Urrea</a> had led a large contingent of troops from Matamoros into Texas. Their goal was to neutralize the Texian soldiers gathered along the coast. Urrea's men easily followed the trail left by Johnson's herd of horses. Mexican soldiers surprised the sleeping Texians in San Patricio in the early hours of February 27. After a fifteen-minute battle, all but six Texians had been killed or imprisoned. One Mexican soldier was killed and four injured.

Under President <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a>, the Mexican government began to shift away from a <a href="federalism">federalist</a> model to a more <a href="centralized%20government">centralized government</a>. Santa Anna's increasingly dictatorial policies, including the revocation of the <a href="Constitution%20of%201824">Constitution of 1824</a> in early 1835, incited federalists throughout the nation to revolt. The <a href="Mexican%20Army">Mexican Army</a> quickly put down revolts in the Mexican interior, including a brutal suppression of militias in <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a> and <a href="Zacatecas">Zacatecas</a>. Unrest continued in the northeastern Mexican state of <a href="Coahuila%20y%20Tejas">Coahuila y Tejas</a>. The area that bordered the United States, known as <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Texas</a>, was populated primarily by English-speaking settlers, known as <a href="Texian">Texian</a>s. In October, the Texians took up arms in what became known as the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>. The following month, Texians declared themselves part of a state independent from Coahuila and created a provisional state government based on the principles of the Constitution of 1824. By the end of the year, all Mexican troops had been expelled from Texas.

Leading federalists in Mexico advocated a plan to attack centralist troops in <a href="Matamoros%2C%20Tamaulipas">Matamoros</a>. Members of the <a href="Consultation%20%28Texas%29">General Council</a>, the interim Texas governing body, were enamored with the idea of a <a href="Matamoros%20Expedition">Matamoros Expedition</a>. They hoped it would inspire other federalist states to revolt and keep the bored Texian troops from deserting the army. Most importantly, it would move the war zone outside Texas. The Council officially approved the plan on December 25, and on December 30 <a href="Frank%20W.%20Johnson">Frank W. Johnson</a>, the commander of the volunteer army, and his aide <a href="James%20Grant%20%28Texas%29">James Grant</a> took the bulk of the army and almost all of the supplies to <a href="Goliad%2C%20Texas">Goliad</a> to prepare for the expedition.

Determined to quash the rebellion, Santa Anna began assembling a large force to restore order; by the end of 1835, his army numbered 6,019 soldiers. In late December, at his behest, <a href="Congress%20of%20Mexico">Congress</a> passed the <a href="Tornel%20Decree">Tornel Decree</a>, declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops "will be deemed <a href="Piracy%20in%20the%20Caribbean%23End%20of%20an%20era">pirates</a> and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag". In the early nineteenth century, captured pirates were executed immediately. The resolution thus gave the Mexican Army permission to take no prisoners in the war against the Texians. Santa Anna personally led the bulk of his troops inland to <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio de Béxar</a> and ordered General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Urrea">José de Urrea</a> to lead 550 troops along the <a href="Atascocita%20Road">Atascocita Road</a> toward Goliad. Urrea's efforts to quell the rebellion along the <a href="Texas%20Gulf%20Coast">Texas Gulf Coast</a> have become known as the <a href="Goliad%20Campaign">Goliad Campaign</a>.

The Texas provisional government had named <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> the commander of a new <a href="regular%20army">regular army</a> in Texas, but without authority over the volunteers who reported to Johnson. The provisional governor, <a href="Henry%20Smith%20%28Texas%20Governor%29">Henry Smith</a>, opposed the Matamoros Expedition and ordered Houston to find a way to disband it. In a rousing speech to the volunteers, Houston dissuaded the bulk of the men from continuing their mission. Many left the army, while others joined the troops stationed under Houston's second-in-command, <a href="James%20Fannin">James Fannin</a>, at <a href="Presidio%20La%20Bahia">Presidio La Bahia</a> in Goliad. By the end of January 1836, only 70 men remained with Johnson and Grant. Most of these volunteers were Americans or Europeans who had arrived in Texas after the Texas Revolution had commenced.

Urrea reached Matamoros on January 31. A committed federalist himself, he soon convinced other federalists in the area that the Texians' ultimate goal was secession and their attempt to spark a federalist revolt in Matamoros was just a method of diverting attention from themselves. Urrea's force crossed into Texas on February 18.

Meanwhile, Mexican double agents continued to assure Johnson and Grant that they would be able to take Matamoros easily. Despite hearing rumors that the Mexican army was approaching, Grant and Johnson chose to take their men south of the <a href="Nueces%20River">Nueces River</a>, into territory belonging to the state of <a href="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a>, to search for horses to buy, steal, or otherwise gather. About February 21, Johnson and part of the group began herding about 100 horses back into Texas. The rest of the men remained with Grant, ostensibly to look for more horses. In actuality, he was attempting to rendezvous with his allies near Matamoros to determine whether federalists were still willing to rise up against the Mexican army.

Johnson's men arrived on February 24 in <a href="San%20Patricio%2C%20Texas">San Patricio</a>, an Irish settlement about north of Matamoros. Many of the San Patricio residents were centralists, loyal to the Mexican government. Johnson sent twelve men to guard the horses at the ranch of Julian de la Garza, approximately outside the town, while the rest garrisoned in San Patricio. The weather was frigid, and the men's clothes were threadbare. Confident that Grant would alert him if Mexican troops were in the area, Johnson chose not to appoint sentries, instead allowing all of the men to take shelter.

The Mexican troops easily followed the trail left by Johnson's herd. On February 25, Urrea led 100 <a href="dragoon">dragoon</a>s and 100 infantry to corner the Texians. By 10 p.m., scouts reported that Texian troops were established in San Patricio. The Mexican soldiers continued marching through the cold night; six of the troops died of exposure.

Urrea instructed three officers to go to San Patricio dressed as civilians and warn the centralists that the Mexican army was approaching. In an effort to reduce casualties and property damage, centralists were asked to declare their loyalties by leaving lanterns burning in their windows. Locals also gave the officers precise information on which buildings housed Texian soldiers. Urrea sent 30 men under Captain Rafael Pretalia to de la Garza's ranch to surprise the Texians camped there. At 3:30 a.m. on February 26, the remaining Mexican soldiers entered San Patricio.

One group of Texians surrendered immediately when they awoke to find themselves surrounded by Mexican troops. When another party of Texians was asked to surrender, they instead opened fire, killing a Mexican officer and wounding two other soldiers. Determined to prevent more casualties, Mexican dragoons prepared to set the house on fire to force the Texians out. At this point, several Texians called that they were surrendering. As they left the house, they were shot or lanced.

By chance, Johnson and three of his men, Lieutenant Daniel Toler and Sergeants Love and Miller, were still awake and discussing tactics. Mexican troops had been told that the house where Johnson was quartered was one of their targets, yet a lamp burned in the window, signaling that this was the home of a loyalist. Out of an abundance of caution, a group of troops knocked on the door. Before the Texians could open the door, they heard the gunfire from the town square. Toler looked out a window and saw uniformed troops on the porch. Without opening the door, he told the soldiers, in Spanish, that there were no troops there, but he would open the door momentarily. The fighting moved into the street, and soldiers who had been guarding the back door of the house rushed around to the front. Johnson, Toler, Love, and Miller dashed out the back door and escaped.

At the de la Garza ranch, the Texians had been taking turns standing sentry. In the cold, all of the sentries had fallen asleep. Pretalia's soldiers opened fire on the sleeping men, injuring two Texians. In the subsequent fight, four Texians died, eight men (three Americans and five "<a href="Tejano">Tejano</a>s", Mexican-Ethnicity Texans) were taken prisoner, and several escaped.

The fighting ended within fifteen minutes.

Six Texians escaped, including Johnson, Toler, Miller, Love, and John F. Beck. They made their way on foot to <a href="Refugio%2C%20Texas">Refugio</a>, where they sent a messenger to Fannin at Goliad, north, to let him know that Urrea's army was close. The survivors reached Goliad on February 29. After filling out an official report on the battle, Johnson, Toler, and Love left the army and went to <a href="San%20Felipe%2C%20Texas">San Felipe</a>. The remaining survivors joined Fannin's troops and were later killed in the <a href="Goliad%20Massacre">Goliad Massacre</a>.

Eleven Texians were killed outright, five suffered mortal wounds, and 21 others were taken prisoner. Six local men were also arrested for aiding the rebellion. Some historians report that most were executed immediately in the town square. According to reports by Johnson and another Texian, Urrea questioned several of the prisoners, and there were reports that the men were tortured. Within 72 hours all of the prisoners were dead. One Mexican soldier was killed and four were wounded.

Urrea's official records state that the battle was fought at Fort Lipantitlán, on the other side of the Nueces River. Texian accounts are consistent that the fighting occurred in town and at the de la Garza ranch. While Urrea waited for reinforcements before beginning his march towards Goliad, his advance party searched for Grant and the remaining Texians. After learning of Grant's whereabouts from local spies, on March 2 Mexican dragoons ambushed the Texians <a href="Battle%20of%20Agua%20Dulce">at Agua Dulce Creek</a>.

Battle of Agua Dulce

The Battle of Agua Dulce Creek was a skirmish during the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a> between Mexican troops and rebellious colonists of the <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Mexican province of Texas</a>, known as <a href="Texians">Texians</a>. As part of the <a href="Goliad%20Campaign">Goliad Campaign</a> to retake the Texas <a href="Gulf%20Coast">Gulf Coast</a>, Mexican troops ambushed a group of Texians on March 2, 1836. The skirmish began approximately south of <a href="San%20Patricio%2C%20Texas">San Patricio</a>, in territory belonging to the Mexican state of <a href="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a>.

When Mexico transitioned to a <a href="centralized%20government">centralized government</a> in 1835, supporters of <a href="federalism">federalism</a> took up arms. Colonists in Texas revolted in October 1835 and by the end of the year had expelled all Mexican troops from their province. With hostilities temporarily suspended, <a href="Frank%20W.%20Johnson">Frank W. Johnson</a>, the commander of the volunteer army in Texas, and <a href="James%20Grant%20%28Texas%29">James Grant</a> gathered volunteers for a planned invasion of the Mexican port town of <a href="Matamoros%2C%20Tamaulipas">Matamoros</a>. In late February 1836, Johnson and half of the volunteers drove a herd of horses to San Patricio, while Grant took the remaining men to gather more horses and to attempt contact with federalist sympathizers near Matamoros.

Unknown to the Texians, on February 18, Mexican General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Urrea">José de Urrea</a> led a large contingent of troops from Matamoros into Texas to neutralize the rebels gathered along the coast. His troops easily defeated Johnson's small force on February 26. Several days later, informants revealed Grant's location, and on the morning of March 2, Urrea sent 150 troops to ambush the rebels. After a brief battle, the main body of the Texian and Tejano troops were defeated. Grant and two others escaped the battle and were pursued for . Grant was killed, as were 11 men under his command. Six Texians were taken prisoner; contrary to Santa Anna's orders, Urrea did not execute them, but instead sent them to a jail in Matamoros. An additional six Texians escaped; five of them later died in the <a href="Goliad%20massacre">Goliad massacre</a>.

Under President <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a>, the Mexican government began to shift away from a <a href="federalism">federalist</a> model to a more <a href="centralized%20government">centralized government</a>.

The area that bordered the United States, known as <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Texas</a>, was populated primarily by English-speaking settlers, known as <a href="Texians">Texians</a>. In October, the Texians took up arms in what became known as the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>. The following month, Texians declared themselves part of a Mexican state independent from Coahuila and created a provisional state government based on the principles of the Constitution of 1824. By the end of the year, all Mexican troops had been expelled from Texas.

Leading federalists in Mexico advocated a plan to attack centralist troops in <a href="Matamoros%2C%20Tamaulipas">Matamoros</a>, a major Mexican port. Members of the <a href="Consultation%20%28Texas%29">General Council</a>, the interim Texas governing body, were enamored with the idea of a <a href="Matamoros%20Expedition">Matamoros Expedition</a>. They hoped it would inspire other federalist states to revolt and keep the bored Texian troops from deserting the army. Most importantly, it would move the war zone outside Texas.

Historian Stuart Reid posits that Grant was a British secret agent and that his efforts were an unofficial scheme to advance British interests in the region. Britain did not welcome the idea of an independent Texas, and the invasion of Matamoros was a way to tie Texas more tightly to Mexico.

Determined to quash the rebellion, Santa Anna began assembling a large force to restore order. In late December, at Santa Anna's behest, the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Union">Mexican Congress</a> passed the <a href="Tornel%20Decree">Tornel Decree</a>, declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops "will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag." In the early nineteenth century, captured pirates were executed immediately. The resolution thus gave the Mexican Army permission to take no prisoners in the war against the Texians. Santa Anna personally led the bulk of his troops inland to <a href="San%20Antonio%20de%20B%C3%A9xar">San Antonio de Béxar</a>, and ordered General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Urrea">José de Urrea</a> to lead 550 troops along the <a href="Atascocita%20Road">Atascocita Road</a> toward Goliad. Urrea's efforts to quell the rebellion along the <a href="Texas%20Gulf%20Coast">Texas Gulf Coast</a> have become known as the <a href="Goliad%20Campaign">Goliad Campaign</a>.

The Texas provisional government had named <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> the commander of a new <a href="regular%20army">regular army</a> in Texas, but without authority over the volunteers who reported to Johnson. The provisional governor, <a href="Henry%20Smith%20%28Texas%20governor%29">Henry Smith</a>, opposed the Matamoros Expedition and ordered Houston to find a way to disband it. In a rousing speech to the volunteers, Houston dissuaded the bulk of the men from continuing their mission. Many left the army. Others joined the troops stationed under Houston's second-in-command, <a href="James%20Fannin">James Fannin</a>, at <a href="Presidio%20La%20Bah%C3%ADa">Presidio La Bahía</a> in Goliad. By the end of January 1836, only 70 men remained with Johnson and Grant. Most of these volunteers were Americans or Europeans who had arrived in Texas after fighting had commenced.

Urrea reached Matamoros on January 31. A committed federalist himself, he soon convinced other federalists in the area that the Texians' ultimate goal was secession and their attempt to spark a federalist revolt in Matamoros was just a method of diverting attention from themselves. Meanwhile, Mexican double agents continued to assure Johnson and Grant that they would be able to take Matamoros easily. Urrea's force crossed into Texas on February 18.

Despite hearing rumors that the Mexican Army was approaching, Grant and Johnson chose to take their men south of the <a href="Nueces%20River">Nueces River</a>, into territory belonging to the state of <a href="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a>, to search for horses to buy, steal, or otherwise gather. About February 21, Johnson and a small group began herding approximately 100 horses back into Texas. The rest of the men remained with Grant, ostensibly to look for more horses. In actuality, he was attempting to rendezvous with his allies near Matamoros to determine whether federalists were still willing to rise up against the Mexican Army.

Mexican troops arrived in San Patricio in the early hours of February 26. After a <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Patricio">fifteen-minute battle</a>, Johnson's men were defeated; six Texians, including Johnson, escaped, and the remainder were killed or captured. While Urrea waited for reinforcements before beginning his march towards Goliad, his advance party searched for Grant and the remaining Texians. Unaware of Johnson's fate, on February 27 Grant and his party began their march northward to San Patricio, driving a herd of several hundred horses he had purchased. The men camped along <a href="San%20Fernando%20Creek">San Fernando Creek</a> on March 1. Local ranchers welcomed them, but that night sent a messenger to Urrea with Grant's location and plans.

Mexican troops marched overnight towards El Puerto de los Cuates de Agua Dulce, a well-known crossing point on Agua Dulce Creek. Approximately south of San Patricio, about from <a href="Banquete%2C%20Texas">Banquete</a>, and just north of modern-day <a href="Kingsville%2C%20Texas">Kingsville</a>, Mexican soldiers took cover in two groves of trees. Urrea had approximately 150 troops, including 80 <a href="dragoon">dragoon</a>s.

Grant's company comprised about 53 men, including a large contingent of "Tejanos" (Mexican-born residents of Texas) under the command of <a href="Pl%C3%A1cido%20Benavides">Plácido Benavides</a>. The men were in good spirits and rode at an easy pace towards San Patricio. Grant, Benavides, and Ruben Brown rode ahead of the main body of Texians and saw no signs of Mexican soldiers.

Between 10 and 11 am, as the bulk of the Texians reached the trees, the Mexican cavalry attacked. Taken completely unaware, many of the Texians were shot before they were able to raise their guns. As they tried to flee, dragoons chased them down and lanced them off their horses. Five Texians dismounted and made a run for a small village nearby, hoping to gain cover so they could use their rifles. Urrea sent the infantry after them. Two of those Texians were captured and the rest escaped.

Grant, Benavides, and Brown turned back to join the other Texians. Once in the battle, Brown dismounted, either to reload his rifle or because his horse was killed. Seeing that the battle was lost, Grant pulled Brown onto another horse, and the two of them and Benavides turned to flee. Mexican cavalry attempted to stop them; Grant shot one officer and he and Benavides then galloped past that officer's horse. At this point, the herd stampeded, forcing the Mexican cavalry aside. The three Texians followed the horses. Mexican soldiers promptly gave chase. According to Brown's later recollection, both his and Grant's horses were wounded as Mexican soldiers fired after them.

The three Texians ran for , occasionally firing their pistols to force Mexican dragoons to stay back. Mexican soldiers yelled that the men would be spared if they surrendered, but none of the Texians believed them. Benavides had the strongest mount, and Grant ordered him to go ahead to warn Fannin that the Mexican Army was close to Goliad. Grant and Brown were surrounded and forced to stop. Grant killed a Mexican soldier who drove a lance through Brown's arm. Between ten and twelve Mexican soldiers then surrounded Grant, and he died after being pierced multiple times. Historian Stuart Reid theorizes that Mexican soldiers were eager to ensure Grant did not survive the battle. Grant could identify federalist sympathizers in Matamoros and the surrounding areas, and his knowledge potentially put Urrea and some of his federalist-sympathizing troops at risk.

Brown threw his empty pistol at one Mexican officer, then grabbed the lance from the man Grant had shot and used it to defend himself. After soldiers <a href="lasso">lasso</a>ed him, Brown surrendered and was taken captive. Brown was then brought back to the site of the ambush. He recalled that one severely injured Texian, Joseph Carpenter, was lying in the dirt, begging for his life. Brown then saw a Mexican soldier shoot him.

Although Urrea reported that 42 Texians were killed, early 20th century historians generally only list 12 Texians as killed. Tejano involvement in the revolution had been notably absent from textbooks until the 1970s, so it is likely that historians were not including the "Tejanos" under Benavides. Six Texians were taken prisoner. In defiance of the Tornel Decree, Urrea spared those who surrendered and sent them to a prison in Matamoros. Reports indicated that Urrea offered clemency after the intervention of <a href="Francita%20Alavez">Francita Alavez</a>, the mistress of one of Urrea's soldiers.
Six Texians escaped. Five of these joined Fannin's garrison at Goliad and were later killed in the <a href="Goliad%20massacre">Goliad massacre</a>. No reports of Mexican losses have been found, although at least one Mexican soldier is thought to have died. After the battle, Mexican soldiers rounded up the horses that the Texians had been herding and kept them. The battle marked the end of the Matamoros Expedition. Although it occurred on the same day that Texas <a href="Texas%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">declared independence</a>, Grant and his men did not know that they were fighting for the new <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>.

According to historian <a href="Stephen%20Hardin">Stephen Hardin</a>, this battle proved that the Texians did not fight well on open prairies. News of the battle reached Fannin on March 4. Urrea's imminent arrival worried Fannin, who feared that Santa Anna would lead his troops from San Antonio de Béxar towards Goliad, essentially trapping Fannin and his men between the two branches of the Mexican Army. Fannin wrote to the Acting Governor, <a href="James%20W.%20Robinson%20%28Texas%20and%20California%29">James Robinson</a>, "I am a better judge of my military abilities than others, and if I am qualified to command an Army, I have not found it out." The <a href="Convention%20of%201836">acting Texas government</a> nonetheless left Fannin in charge of the fort at Goliad, instructing him to determine whether it was best to retreat or make a stand. Fannin delayed making a decision, finally choosing to leave Goliad on March 19. Urrea's troops trapped Fannin's men on an open prairie. The Texians surrendered after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Coleto">Battle of Coleto</a> and most, including Colonel Fannin, were executed a week later in the <a href="Goliad%20massacre">Goliad massacre</a>.

William Samuel Sadler (June 24, 1875 – April 26, 1969) was an American <a href="surgeon">surgeon</a>, <a href="psychiatrist">self-trained psychiatrist</a>, and author who helped publish "<a href="The%20Urantia%20Book">The Urantia Book</a>". The book is said to have resulted from Sadler's relationship with a man through whom he believed celestial beings spoke at night. It drew a following of people who studied its teachings.

A native of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, Sadler moved to <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> as a teenager to work at the <a href="Battle%20Creek%20Sanitarium">Battle Creek Sanitarium</a>. There he met the physician and health-food promoter <a href="John%20Harvey%20Kellogg">John Harvey Kellogg</a>, co-inventor of <a href="corn%20flakes">corn flakes</a> breakfast cereal, who became his mentor. Sadler married Kellogg's niece, <a href="Lena%20Celestia%20Kellogg">Lena Celestia Kellogg</a>, in 1897. He worked for several Christian organizations and attended medical school, graduating in 1906. Sadler practiced medicine in Chicago with his wife, who was also a physician. He joined several medical associations and taught at the <a href="McCormick%20Theological%20Seminary">McCormick Theological Seminary</a>. Although he was a committed member of the <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> for almost twenty years, he left the denomination after it disfellowshipped his wife's uncle in 1907. Sadler and his wife became speakers on the <a href="Chautauqua">Chautauqua</a> adult education circuit in 1907, and he became a highly paid, popular orator. He eventually wrote over 40 books on a variety of medical and spiritual topics advocating a <a href="holistic">holistic</a> approach to health. Sadler extolled the value of prayer and religion but was skeptical of <a href="mediums">mediums</a>, assisting debunker <a href="Howard%20Thurston">Howard Thurston</a>, and embraced the scientific consensus on <a href="evolution">evolution</a>.

In 1910, Sadler went to Europe and studied psychiatry for a year under <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>. Sometime between 1906 and 1911, Sadler attempted to treat a patient with an unusual sleep condition. While the patient was sleeping he spoke to Sadler and claimed to be an <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial</a>. Sadler spent years observing the sleeping man in an effort to explain the phenomenon, and eventually decided the man had no mental illness and that his words were genuine. The man's identity was never publicized, but speculation has focused on Sadler's brother-in-law, Wilfred Kellogg. Over the course of several years, Sadler and his assistants visited the man while he slept, conversing with him about spirituality, history, and <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a>, and asking him questions. A larger number of interested people met at Sadler's home to discuss the man's responses and to suggest additional questions. The man's words were eventually published in "The Urantia Book", and the <a href="Urantia%20Foundation">Urantia Foundation</a> was created to assist Sadler in spreading the book's message. It is not known who wrote and edited the book, but several commentators have speculated that Sadler played a guiding role in its publication. Although it never became the basis of an organized religion, the book attracted followers who devoted themselves to its study, and the movement continued after Sadler's death.

Sadler was born June 24, 1875, in <a href="Spencer%2C%20Indiana">Spencer, Indiana</a>, to Samuel Cavins Sadler and Sarah Isabelle Wilson. Of English and Irish descent, he was raised in <a href="Wabash%2C%20Indiana">Wabash, Indiana</a>. Samuel did not enroll his son in public schools. Despite his lack of formal education, Sadler read many books about history as a child and became a skilled public speaker at a young age. Samuel was a convert to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and William was baptized into the denomination in 1888 and became devoutly religious.

In 1889, William Sadler moved to <a href="Battle%20Creek%2C%20Michigan">Battle Creek, Michigan</a>, to work at the <a href="Battle%20Creek%20Sanitarium">Battle Creek Sanitarium</a>, where he served as a <a href="bellhop">bellhop</a> and helped in the kitchen. He also attended <a href="Battle%20Creek%20College">Battle Creek College</a> for one year when he was 16. Both institutions had strong ties to his church and Sadler was mentored by local Adventist businessman <a href="John%20Harvey%20Kellogg">John Harvey Kellogg</a>, who heavily influenced Sadler's views. Sadler's early writings about health are similar to ideas advanced by John Kellogg, including the concept of <a href="autointoxication">autointoxication</a>, and the idea that <a href="caffeine">caffeine</a> has negative <a href="Health%20effects%20of%20caffeine">health effects</a>. He similarly condemned the consumption of tobacco, meat, and alcohol. Although Sadler did drink later in his life.

Sadler graduated from Battle Creek College in 1894 and subsequently worked for John Kellogg's brother, <a href="William%20K.%20Kellogg">William K. Kellogg</a> as a health-food salesman. Sadler, a skilled salesman, persuaded William Kellogg to market his products through demonstrations in retail stores. In 1894, he oversaw the establishment of Life Boat Mission, a <a href="Mission%20%28station%29">mission</a> that Kellogg founded on <a href="State%20Street%20%28Chicago%29">State Street</a> in Chicago. Sadler operated the mission and published "Life Boat Magazine"; its sales were intended to provide funds for Kellogg's Chicago Medical Mission. Sadler also contributed articles to other Adventist publications, including the "<a href="Adventist%20Review">Review and Herald</a>". Around 1895, Sadler attended <a href="Moody%20Bible%20Institute">Moody Bible Institute</a> in Chicago, Illinois, where he trained to be an evangelist, ultimately becoming an ordained minister in 1901.

In 1897, Sadler married John Kellogg's niece, Lena Celestia Kellogg, a nurse whom he had met four years previously. Their first child, William, called Willis, born in 1899, died a ten months later. Their second child, William S. Sadler Jr., was born in 1907. The couple had been interested in medicine for several years, but the loss of their child inspired them to pursue medical careers. In 1901, they moved to San Francisco to attend medical school at <a href="Cooper%20Medical%20College">Cooper Medical College</a>. In San Francisco, he served as the "superintendent of young people's work" for the church's California conference and the president of a local Medical Missionary society. The couple also operated a home for Christian medical students. In 1904, they returned to the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a>, where they attended medical school, each earning a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Medicine">Doctor of Medicine</a> degree two years later. Sadler was an early adopter of Freudian psychoanalysis, and believed that experiences individuals have as infants play a key role in their minds as adults, although he did not accept many of Freud's ideas about sexuality or religion.

Although Sadler was a committed Adventist for much of his early life, he stayed less involved after John Kellogg was excommunicated in 1907 in the wake of a conflict with <a href="Ellen%20G.%20White">Ellen G. White</a>, the church's founder. The Sadlers became disenchanted with the church and subsequently criticized it. Sadler rejected some Adventist teachings, such as White's status as a prophetess and the importance of <a href="Saturday%20as%20Sabbath">Saturday as Sabbath</a>. He retained a positive view of White and rejected allegations that she was a charlatan.

By 1912, Sadler and his wife, both doctors by then, operated a joint practice in Chicago that catered to children's and women's health issues. Sadler initially focused on surgery, performing surgeries with his wife, but widened his practice to include psychiatric counseling in 1930 and became a consulting psychiatrist at <a href="Columbus%20Hospital%20%28Chicago%29">Columbus Hospital</a>. As a psychiatrist, Sadler advocated an eclectic mix of techniques, applying the theories of Sigmund Freud, <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Adler">Alfred Adler</a>, and <a href="Adolf%20Meyer%20%28psychiatrist%29">Adolf Meyer</a>. Sadler believed that religious faith was beneficial to mental health, and specifically promoted prayer, which he believed to be most effective in the context of Christian faith. However, he thought that religious beliefs were deleterious to mental health if based on fear.

Sadler and his wife moved into an <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a>-style house—the first <a href="steel-frame">steel-frame</a> residence in Chicago—on <a href="Diversey%20Parkway%20%28Chicago%29">Diversey Parkway</a> in 1912. The couple operated their medical practice in the building. He was a member of the <a href="American%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> and of medical associations including the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a>, the <a href="American%20Psychiatric%20Association">American Psychiatric Association</a>, the American Pathological Society, and the <a href="American%20College%20of%20Surgeons">American College of Surgeons</a>. Sadler was also a member of the faculty of <a href="McCormick%20Theological%20Seminary">McCormick Theological Seminary</a>, and taught <a href="pastoral%20psychology">pastoral psychology</a>. He argued that pastors should be educated in basic psychiatry so they could recognize symptoms of mental illness in congregants. His students later recalled him as an engaging and humorous public speaker.

Sadler wrote about many topics. In 1909, he published his first book, an evangelical work, titled "Self-Winning Texts, or Bible Helps for Personal Work". In the 1910s, he regularly worked all night on his writing projects. In addition to 42 books, most of which were about personal health issues, he wrote magazine articles. Many of Sadler's books focused on popular <a href="self-help">self-help</a> topics; historian Jonathan Spiro deems Sadler's "The Elements of Pep" a "quintessential book of the 1920s". In 1936, Sadler published "Theory and Practice of Psychiatry", a 1,200-page work in which he attempted to provide a comprehensive outline of psychiatry.

Sadler also wrote about race: he had an interest in <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>, likely owing to Kellogg's interest in the concept, and <a href="Madison%20Grant">Madison Grant</a>'s book "<a href="The%20Passing%20of%20the%20Great%20Race">The Passing of the Great Race</a>". Sadler wrote several works about eugenics, endorsing and heavily borrowing from Grant's views, which posited that the "Nordic race" was superior to others. In his writings, Sadler contended that some races were at a lower stage of evolution—closer to <a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a>s than were other races—and were consequently less civilized and more aggressive. Sadler argued that alcoholism and "feeblemindedness, insanity, and delinquency" were hereditary traits and that those who possessed them were breeding at a much faster rate than "superior human beings". He feared that this issue could threaten the "civilization we bequeath our descendants". He also believed that the majority of criminals were mentally ill.

In 1907, Sadler began giving lectures on the <a href="Chautauqua">Chautauqua</a> adult-education circuit, which featured itinerant speakers discussing self-help and morality. Sadler often spoke about attaining physical and mental health without drugs. He also promoted <a href="hydrotherapy">hydrotherapy</a> and discussed moral issues that related to men. Sadler, his wife, her sister, and a friend, formed a four-member lecture company that gave two- or three-day engagements, sometimes accompanied by an orchestra. Newspapers published favorable reviews of the productions. The lectures proved to be a lucrative endeavor: it was rumored that he became one of the best-paid Chautauqua speakers.

Sadler believed that mediums were a source of false comfort and, after World War I ended, fought against the increased popularity of communication with the dead. In the 1910s and 1920s, attempting to expose purported clairvoyants became one of Sadler's favorite pastimes and he regularly worked with a Northwestern University psychologist and <a href="Howard%20Thurston">Howard Thurston</a>, then a prominent magician, while investigating psychics. Sadler may have met the magician <a href="Harry%20Houdini">Harry Houdini</a> (who was also a <a href="skeptic">skeptic</a>) around this time.

According to the origin story of "The Urantia Book", sometime between 1906 and 1911, a woman consulted Sadler about her husband's deep sleeping, prompting Sadler to observe him while he slept. He noticed that the sleeping man made unusual movements; the man then purportedly spoke to Sadler in an unusual voice and claimed to be a "visitor ... from another planet". Observers related that the man later claimed to carry messages from several celestial beings. Sadler suspected that the man's words were drawn from his mind and sought a scientific explanation for the phenomenon. Although he examined the man for psychiatric problems, he was unable to make a satisfactory diagnosis. Sadler and five others subsequently visited the man on a regular basis, speaking with him as he slept. In 1925, a large handwritten document was discovered in the patient's house; papers were said to appear in the house for years afterwards. Sadler brought the papers to his house and did not allow anyone to take them away, although some were allowed to read them on site. Sadler presumed that the documents were the product of <a href="automatic%20handwriting">automatic handwriting</a> from the man's subconscious, but changed his mind after further analysis. He made no public statements about their authenticity for years.

In 1924, Sadler began hosting Sunday tea gatherings at his home, which could accommodate fifty guests. Many attendees worked in the medical establishment, and typically adhered to a <a href="Progressivism">progressive</a> ideology. The group often held a forum to discuss the patient with the sleep issue and devise questions for him. The observers withheld the man's name from the group, but relayed some of his statements. In 1925, the forum, which then had thirty members, closed their meetings to visitors and began to require a pledge of secrecy. Sadler instructed forum members not to publicize what they learned, telling them that they had an incomplete picture of what was occurring. He also feared that the patient would face criticism if his identity were known. His identity has never been confirmed; <a href="Joscelyn%20Godwin">Joscelyn Godwin</a>, of Colgate University, and skeptic <a href="Martin%20Gardner">Martin Gardner</a> posit that the sleeping man was Wilfred Kellogg, the husband of Lena's sister Anna.

In 1935, Sadler concluded that the papers found in the sleeping patient's house were not a hoax, citing their "genuineness and insight", and arguing that the sleeping man was not a <a href="Mediumship">medium</a> for the dead, but was used by living beings to communicate. Papers ceased appearing in the sleeping man's house in the 1930s; Sadler then took a clear role as leader of the discussion group. The forum discontinued their discussion meetings in 1942, and "The Urantia Book" was published in 1955; it purportedly contained information from the celestial beings who had spoken through the sleeping man. "The Urantia Book" presents itself as the fifth "epochal" revelation God has given to humanity, and states that its purpose is to help humanity evolve to a higher form of life. It has four sections. The first section covers the nature of God and the universe, the second describes the portions of the universe nearest to Earth and <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>'s rebellion, the third details the history of Earth and human religions, and the fourth provides an account of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>'s life and accompanying doctrines. Sadler maintained that the teachings of the book were "essentially Christian" and "entirely harmonious with ... known scientific facts". Although Sadler had left the Adventist church by the time "The Urantia Book" was published, its teachings are broadly consistent with some aspects of Adventist theology, such as <a href="soul%20sleep">soul sleep</a> and <a href="annihilationism">annihilationism</a>. Journalist Brook Wilensky-Lanford argues in her 2011 profile of the Urantia movement that Sadler's departure from the Adventist church gave him the desire to build a new religious movement, citing the emphasis that Sadler placed on the discussion of the <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Garden of Eden</a> in "The Urantia Book" as evidence of his desire to start anew. Sadler hoped that the content of the revelation would convince people of its worth, and did not attempt to win supporters by emphasizing its author. Wilensky-Lanford argues that Sadler attempted to avoid placing an individual at the center of his beliefs owing to his disappointment in Ellen White; however, Gardner believes that Sadler placed his faith in Wilfred Kellogg as he had in White.

Until her death in 1939, Sadler's wife Lena was a regular forum participant. One member subsequently objected to Sadler's leadership, alleging that he became hungry for power after his wife's death. In the early 1950s, the Urantia Foundation was established to publish "The Urantia Book". <a href="Hubert%20Wilkins">Hubert Wilkins</a>, a friend of Sadler who had a keen interest in the book, contributed the initial funding for publication costs. Rather than create an organized religion, the foundation's leadership opted for what they called "slow growth"; early adherents sought to educate people about the book's teachings rather than found a church-like organization. Sadler also disavowed <a href="proselytizing">proselytizing</a> and publicity, although he wrote several works about the content of "The Urantia Book". In 1958, Sadler published a defense of the book, citing his experience exposing frauds and maintaining that the book was free of contradictions. Since his death, several reading groups, seminars, and churches have been established to study the book and to spread its message.

The authorship of the Urantia papers is disputed. Journalist <a href="Brad%20Gooch">Brad Gooch</a> argues in his 2002 profile of the Urantia movement that Sadler was the author of "The Urantia Book", citing similarities between some of its passages and contents of Sadler's earlier writings. Gardner believes that Sadler wrote part of the papers, but heavily edited and revised most of them. He also contends that Sadler refused to include some material provided to him for inclusion in the book, and that he plagiarized from other works. Ken Glasziou, a supporter of the Urantia Foundation, contends that statistical evidence of the text and Sadler's other works indicates that he did not write, or extensively edit, "The Urantia Book".

In 1952, Sadler's final book, "Courtship and Love", was published by Macmillan Publishers. He wrote another title, "A Doctor Talks With His Patient", but after it was rejected by a publisher, he decided to stop writing. In March 1957, Sadler was appointed as the superintendent of Barboursville State Hospital in <a href="Barboursville%2C%20West%20Virginia">Barboursville, West Virginia</a>, where he stayed until July 1958.

As he grew older, Sadler generally remained in good health, with the exception of a condition that led to the removal of an eye. He died on April 26, 1969, at 93 years of age. Christensen recalls that Sadler was visited by friends and family while on his deathbed; he spoke to them of his confidence in a joyful life after death. He received a full-column obituary in the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", which discussed his success as a doctor but not his association with "The Urantia Book".

By the time of his death, Sadler was acclaimed for his accurate prediction of the advent of organ transplantation decades before the practice became commonplace. Members of the Urantia movement have also held high opinions of Sadler, sometimes idolizing him. In her 2003 profile of the Urantia movement, Lewis states that descriptions of Sadler by members of the movement could suggest that he possessed <a href="charismatic%20authority">charismatic authority</a> and is revered as "the chosen". Gooch deems Sadler the "Moses of the Urantia movement" and casts him as "one of America's homegrown religious leaders, an original along the lines of Joseph Smith". He also applauds Sadler's writings about mediums, describing Sadler's book "The Truth About Spiritualism" as "one of the strongest attacks ever written on fraudulent mediums and their methods".

Gooch believes there is a contradiction between Sadler's advocacy of science and reason and his support of the <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> theological, "inter-planetary" contents of "The Urantia Book". Gardner describes Sadler's life story as "riveting" and summarizes him as an "intelligent, gifted" person who proved to be "gullible" about alleged supernatural revelations. He contends that Sadler eventually developed <a href="megalomania">megalomania</a> that was unrecognized by those around him and argues that Sadler succumbed to hubris and began to believe that he was a prophet, divinely chosen as the founder and leader of a new religion. Lewis disputes this characterization, maintaining that Sadler and those around him sought only to clarify and explain the teachings of the Bible.

Symphony No. 3 (Górecki)

The Symphony No. 3, <a href="Opus%20number">Op.</a> 36, also known as the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs (), is a <a href="symphony">symphony</a> in three <a href="movement%20%28music%29">movements</a> composed by <a href="Henryk%20G%C3%B3recki">Henryk Górecki</a> in <a href="Katowice">Katowice</a>, Poland, between October and December 1976. The work is indicative of the transition between Górecki's <a href="consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonant</a> earlier manner and his more <a href="tonality">tonal</a> later style and "represented a stylistic breakthrough: austerely plaintive, emotionally direct and steeped in medieval modes." It was premièred on 4 April 1977, at the <a href="Royan%20Festival">Royan International Festival</a>, with <a href="Stefania%20Woytowicz">Stefania Woytowicz</a> as soprano and <a href="Ernest%20Bour">Ernest Bour</a> as conductor.

A solo <a href="soprano">soprano</a> sings Polish texts in each of the three movements. The first is a 15th-century Polish lament of <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Mary, mother of Jesus</a>, the second a message written on the wall of a <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> cell during World War II, and the third a <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>n folk song of a mother searching for her son killed by the Germans in the <a href="Silesian%20uprisings">Silesian uprisings</a>. The first and third movements are written from the perspective of a parent who has lost a child, and the second movement from that of a child separated from a parent. The dominant themes of the symphony are motherhood and separation through war.

Until 1992, Górecki was known only to <a href="connoisseurs">connoisseurs</a>, primarily as one of several composers from the <a href="Polish%20School%20%28music%29">Polish School</a> responsible for the postwar <a href="Music%20of%20Poland%23Classical%20music">Polish music renaissance</a>. That year, <a href="Elektra%20Records%23Beginnings">Elektra-Nonesuch</a> released a recording of the 15-year-old symphony performed by the <a href="London%20Sinfonietta">London Sinfonietta</a>, that topped the classical <a href="Record%20chart">charts</a> in Britain and the United States. To date, it has sold more than a million copies, vastly exceeding the expected lifetime sales of a typical symphonic recording by a 20th-century composer. This success, however, has not generated similar interest in Górecki's other works.

Despite a political climate that was unfavorable to modern art (often denounced as "<a href="Formalism%20%28music%29">formalist</a>" by the <a href="communism">communist</a> authorities), post-war Polish composers enjoyed an unprecedented degree of compositional freedom following the establishment of the <a href="Warsaw%20Autumn">Warsaw Autumn</a> festival in 1956. Górecki had won recognition among avant-garde composers for the experimental, <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonant</a> and <a href="serialism">serialist</a> works of his early career; he became visible on the international scene through such modernist works as "Scontri", which was a success at the 1960 Warsaw Autumn, and his First Symphony, which was awarded a prize at the 1961 Paris Youth Bienniale. Throughout the 1960s, he continued to form acquaintanceships with other experimental and serialist composers such as <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a> and <a href="Karlheinz%20Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>.

During the 1970s, Górecki began to distance himself from the serialism and extreme dissonance of his earlier work, and his Third Symphony, like the preceding choral pieces "Euntes ibant et flebant" (Op. 32, 1972) and "Amen" (Op. 35, 1975), starkly rejects such techniques. The lack of harmonic variation in Górecki's Third Symphony, and its reliance on repetition, marked a stage in Górecki's progression towards the harmonic <a href="minimalist%20music">minimalism</a> and the simplified textures of his more recent work. Because of the religious nature of many of his works during this period, critics and musicologists often align him with other modernist composers who began to explore radically simplified musical textures, <a href="tonality">tonality</a>, and <a href="melody">melody</a>, and who also infused many of their works with religious significance. Like-minded composers, such as <a href="Arvo%20P%C3%A4rt">Arvo Pärt</a> and <a href="John%20Tavener">John Tavener</a>, are frequently grouped with Górecki under the term "<a href="holy%20minimalism">holy minimalism</a>," although none of the composers classified as such has admitted to common influences.

In 1973, Górecki approached the Polish <a href="Folklore">folklorist</a> Adolf Dygacz in search of traditional melodies to incorporate in a new work. Dygacz presented four songs which had been recorded in the <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a> region in south-western Poland. Górecki was impressed by the melody "Where has he gone, my dear young son?" ("Kajże się podzioł mój synocek miły?"), which describes a mother's mourning for a son lost in war, and probably dates from the <a href="Silesian%20Uprising">Silesian Uprising</a>s of 1919–21. Górecki had heard a version of the song in the 1960s and had not been impressed by the arrangement, but the words and the melody of Dygacz's new version made a lasting impression on him. He said "for me, it is a wonderfully poetic text. I do not know if a 'professional' poet would create such a powerful entity out of such terse, simple words. It is not sorrow, despair or resignation, or the wringing of hands: it is just the great grief and lamenting of a mother who has lost her son."

Later that year, Górecki learned of an inscription scrawled on the wall of a cell in a German <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> prison in the town of <a href="Zakopane">Zakopane</a>, which lies at the foot of the <a href="Tatra%20mountains">Tatra mountains</a> in southern Poland. The words were those of 18-year-old , a highland woman incarcerated on 25 September 1944. It read "O Mamo, nie płacz, nie. Niebios Przeczysta Królowo, Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie" (Oh Mamma do not cry, no. Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always). The composer recalled, "I have to admit that I have always been irritated by grand words, by calls for revenge. Perhaps in the face of death I would shout out in this way. But the sentence I found is different, almost an apology or explanation for having got herself into such trouble; she is seeking comfort and support in simple, short but meaningful words". He later explained, "In prison, the whole wall was covered with inscriptions screaming out loud: 'I'm innocent', 'Murderers', 'Executioners', 'Free me', 'You have to save me'—it was all so loud, so banal. Adults were writing this, while here it is an eighteen-year-old girl, almost a child. And she is so different. She does not despair, does not cry, does not scream for revenge. She does not think about herself; whether she deserves her fate or not. Instead, she only thinks about her mother: because it is her mother who will experience true despair. This inscription was something extraordinary. And it really fascinated me."

Górecki now had two texts: one from a mother to her son, the other from a daughter to her mother. While looking for a third that would continue the theme, he decided on a mid-15th-century <a href="Folk%20music">folk song</a> from the southern city of <a href="Opole">Opole</a>. Its text contains a passage in which the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a> speaks to her <a href="Jesus">Son</a> dying on the cross: "O my son, beloved and chosen, Share your wounds with your mother ..." ("Synku miły i wybrany, rozdziel z matką swoje rany ..."). Górecki said, "this text was folk-like, anonymous. So now I had three acts, three persons ... Originally, I wanted to frame these texts with an introduction and a conclusion. I even chose two verses (5 and 6) from <a href="Psalm%2094">Psalm 93/94</a> in the translation by Wujek: 'They humiliated Your people, O Lord, and afflicted Your heritage, they killed the widow and the passer-by, murdered the orphans. However, he rejected this format because he believed the structure would position the work as a symphony "about war". Górecki sought to transcend such specifics, and instead structured the work as three independent <a href="lament">lament</a>s.

The symphony is constructed around simple harmonies, set in a neo-<a href="mode%20%28music%29">modal</a> style which makes use of the <a href="medieval%20music">medieval music</a>al modes, but does not adhere strictly to medieval rules of composition. A performance typically lasts about 54 minutes. Ronald Blum describes the piece as "mournful, like <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a>, but without the bombast of percussion, horns and choir, just the sorrow of strings and the lone soprano". The work consists of three <a href="elegiac">elegiac</a> movements, each marked "Lento" to indicate their slow <a href="Tempo">tempi</a>. Strings dominate the musical textures and the music is rarely loud—the dynamics reach "<a href="fortissimo">fortissimo</a>" in only a few bars.

The symphony is scored for solo <a href="soprano">soprano</a>, four <a href="flute">flute</a>s (two players doubling on <a href="piccolo">piccolo</a>s), four <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>s in B, two <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a>s, two <a href="contrabassoon">contrabassoon</a>s, four <a href="French%20horn">horns</a> in F, four <a href="trombone">trombone</a>s, <a href="harp">harp</a>, <a href="piano">piano</a> and <a href="string%20section">strings</a>. Górecki specifies exact complements for the string forces: 16 first <a href="violin">violin</a>s, 16 second violins, 12 <a href="viola">viola</a>s, 12 <a href="cello">cello</a>s, and 8 <a href="double%20bass">double bass</a>es. For most of the score, these are in turn divided into two parts, each notated on a separate <a href="Staff%20%28music%29">staff</a>. Thus the string writing is mainly in ten different parts, on ten separate staves. In some sections some of these parts are divided even further into separate parts, which are written on the same staff, so that ten staves are still used for a greater number of parts.

Unusually, the score omits <a href="oboe">oboe</a>s, <a href="English%20horn">English horn</a>s, <a href="bass%20clarinet">bass clarinet</a>s, and <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>s. The bassoons, contrabassoons, and trombones play only in the first movement, and only for a few bars (bassoons and contrabassoons: 339–342 and 362–369; trombones: 343–348 and 367–369).

The <a href="musicologist">musicologist</a> Adrian Thomas notes that the symphony lacks <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonance</a> outside of <a href="musical%20mode">modal</a> inflections (that is, occasional use of pitches that fall outside the mode), and that it does not require nonstandard techniques or <a href="virtuoso">virtuosic</a> playing. Thomas further observes that "there is no second-hand stylistic referencing, although if predecessors were to be sought they might be found, distantly removed, in the music of composers as varied as <a href="J.S.%20Bach">Bach</a>, <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>, <a href="Piotr%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>, and even <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>."

Typically 27 minutes in duration, the first movement equals the combined length of the second and third movements, and is based on a late 15th-century <a href="lament">lament</a> of <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Mary</a> from the "Lysagora Songs" collection of the Holy Cross Monastery ("Św. Krzyż Monastery") in the <a href="%C5%9Awi%C4%99tokrzyskie%20Mountains">Świętokrzyskie Mountains</a>. Comprising three <a href="Theme%20%28music%29">thematic</a> sections, the movement opens with a <a href="canon%20%28music%29">canon</a> based on a 24-bar theme, which is repeated several times. The canon begins in 2 parts; then, for each repetition of the theme, an extra part is added, until the canon is in eight parts (with the top two parts doubled at the octave, making for ten voices total), using a 24-bar melody in the <a href="Aeolian%20mode">Aeolian mode</a> on E. It begins with the double basses, 2nd part, with each succeeding entry occurring one <a href="bar%20%28music%29">measure</a> later (i.e., a new entry begins every 25 measures), each starting a diatonic <a href="interval%20%28music%29">fifth</a> above the last. That means that each appearance of the melody in a new part is in a different mode, in this order:


After the 8-part canon is played, it is repeated, with the 1st parts of the 1st and 2nd violins (silent up to this point) doubling the other violin parts an octave higher.

After that, the canon continues, but the voices gradually drop out one by one, from the lowest upwards and the highest downwards; the instruments in question then double, or play the parts of, a higher or lower voice that is still playing, in this order ('→' means 'double/play the parts of'):


The canon ends, with all the strings (except the double basses) ending on a single note, E4.

The soprano enters on the same note in the second section and builds to a climax on the final word, at which point the strings enter forcefully with the climax of the opening canon. The third section of the movement ("Lento—Cantabile semplice") is a long "<a href="d%C3%A9nouement">dénouement</a>", another canon based on the same melody in the opening canon; but this time it starts with 8 parts (the top two doubled in octaves), and the voices drop out from high to low:


The movement thus ends with the lower strings, and the piano (briefly recalling the second section of the movement).

The nine-minute second movement is for soprano, clarinets, horns, harp, piano, and strings, and contains a <a href="libretto">libretto</a> formed from the prayer to the Virgin Mary inscribed by Blazusiakówna on the cell wall in <a href="Zakopane">Zakopane</a>. According to the composer, "I wanted the second movement to be of a highland character, not in the sense of pure folklore, but the climate of <a href="Podhale">Podhale</a> ... I wanted the girl's monologue as if hummed ... on the one hand almost unreal, on the other towering over the orchestra."

The movement opens with a folk <a href="drone%20%28music%29">drone</a>, A–E, and a melodic fragment, E–G–F, which alternate with sudden plunges to a low B–D <a href="Dyad%20%28music%29">dyad</a>. Thomas describes the effect as "almost cinematic ... suggest[ing] the bright open air of the mountains". As the soprano begins to sing, her words are supported by the orchestra until she reaches a climaxing top A. The movement is resolved when the strings hold a chord without <a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29">diminuendo</a> for nearly one and a half minutes. The final words of the movement are the first two lines of the Polish <a href="Ave%20Maria">Ave Maria</a>, sung twice on a repeated pitch by the soprano.

The tempo of the third movement is similar to that of the previous two, and subtle changes in dynamism and <a href="Musical%20mode">mode</a> make it more complex and involving than it may at first appear. With a duration of approximately seventeen minutes, it comprises three verses in <a href="A%20minor">A minor</a> and, like the first movement, is constructed from evolving variations on a simple motif. The melody is established in the opening verse, and the second and third verses revisit the cradling motifs of the second movement. As in the second movement, the motifs are built up from inversions of plain <a href="Triad%20%28music%29">triads</a> and <a href="seventh%20chord">seventh chord</a>s stretching across several octaves. As the soprano sings the final words, the key changes to a pure <a href="diatonic">diatonic</a> <a href="A%20major">A major</a> which accompanies, in writer David Ellis's words, the "ecstatic final stanza":
The orchestra returns to A minor before a final postlude in A major. In Górecki's own words: "Finally there came that unvarying, persistent, obstinate 'walczyk' [on the chord of A], sounding well when played piano, so that all the notes were audible. For the soprano, I used a device characteristic of highland singing: suspending the melody on the third [C] and descending from the fifth to the third while the ensemble moves stepwise downward [in sixths]".

The symphony was dedicated to Górecki's wife Jadwiga Rurańska. When asked why, Górecki responded, "Who was I supposed to dedicate it to?" He never sought to explain the symphony as a response to a political or historical event. Instead, he maintained that the work is an evocation of the ties between mother and child. Górecki was commissioned to write music in response to the Holocaust in the 1960s but was unable to finish any of the pieces he started for that purpose. While Górecki stated that for many years he sought to produce a work specifically in response to <a href="Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a>, he resisted that interpretation of the symphony, which he preferred to be viewed in a wider context. Other critics have attempted to interpret the symphony in spiritual terms, an approach which Górecki also dismissed. Still others have suggested that the symphony can be understood as a compendium of Polish history:

Górecki said of the work, "Many of my family died in concentration camps. I had a grandfather who was in Dachau, an aunt in Auschwitz. You know how it is between Poles and Germans. But Bach was a German too—and Schubert, and Strauss. Everyone has his place on this little earth. That's all behind me. So the Third Symphony is not about war; it's not a "<a href="Dies%20Irae">Dies Irae</a>"; it's a normal Symphony of Sorrowful Songs."
Górecki's Symphony No. 3 was written in 1976, when Górecki was, in the words of the music critic Jane Perlez, "a fiery figure, fashionable only among a small circle of modern-music aficionados". The 1977 world première at the Royan Festival, <a href="Ernest%20Bour">Ernest Bour</a> conducting, was reviewed by six western critics, all of them harshly dismissive. Heinz Koch, writing for "Musica", said that the symphony "drags through three old folk melodies (and nothing else) for an endless 55 minutes". Górecki himself recalled that, at the premiere, he sat next to a "prominent French musician" (Górecki did not name names, though it was probably <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a>), who, after hearing the twenty-one repetitions of an A-major chord at the end of the symphony, loudly exclaimed "<a href="Feces">Merde</a>!"

The symphony was first recorded in Poland in 1978 by the soprano <a href="Stefania%20Woytowicz">Stefania Woytowicz</a>. It was deemed a masterpiece by Polish critics, although, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, recordings and performances of the work were widely criticised by the press outside Poland. The symphony drew hostility from critics who felt that Górecki had moved too far away from the established avant-garde style and was, according to Dietmar Polaczek (writing for "Österreichische Musikzeitschrift"), "simply adding to the decadent trash that encircled the true pinnacles of avant-gardism".

In 1985, the French filmmaker <a href="Maurice%20Pialat">Maurice Pialat</a> featured a section of the third movement in the ending credits of his movie "<a href="Police%20%281985%20film%29">Police</a>". When the work was later repackaged as a "<a href="soundtrack%20album">soundtrack album</a>", it sold well. Although Gorecki's name was featured prominently on the front cover, the <a href="sleeve%20notes">sleeve notes</a> on the back provided precious little information about the work, and Górecki's name appeared in smaller type than those of the main actors. In the mid-1980s, British <a href="industrial%20music">industrial music</a> group <a href="Test%20Dept">Test Dept</a> used the symphony as a backdrop for video <a href="collage">collage</a>s during their concerts, recasting the symphony as a vehicle for the band's sympathy with the Polish <a href="Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29">Solidarity</a> movement, which Górecki also supported (his 1981 piece "<a href="Miserere%20%28G%C3%B3recki%29">Miserere</a>" was composed in part as a response to government opposition of Solidarity trade unions). During the late 1980s, the symphony received increasing airplay on US and British classical radio stations, notably <a href="Classic%20FM%20%28UK%29">Classic FM</a>. The fall of communism helped to spread the popularity of Polish music generally, and by 1990 the symphony was being performed in major cities such as New York, London and Sydney. A 1991 recording with the <a href="London%20Sinfonietta">London Sinfonietta</a>, <a href="Conducting">conducted</a> by <a href="David%20Zinman">David Zinman</a> and featuring the soloist <a href="Dawn%20Upshaw">Dawn Upshaw</a>, was released in 1992 by the <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra</a> imprint <a href="Nonesuch%20Records">Nonesuch Records</a>. Within two years, the recording had sold more than 700,000 copies worldwide; the recording climbed to number 6 on the mainstream UK album charts, and while it did not appear on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, it stayed at the top of the US classical charts for 38 weeks and stayed on for 138 weeks. The Zinman/Upshaw recording has sold over a million copies. It probably counts as the best selling contemporary classical record of all time.

The Jewish writer <a href="Michael%20Steinberg%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Steinberg</a> described the symphony's success as essentially a phenomenon of the <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a>, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in "A guide to the symphony", wondered whether the commercial success of the work was "a flash in the pan" or would turn out to have lasting significance. In 1998, the Jewish critic Michael Steinberg asked, "[are people] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the "<a href="Doctor%20Zhivago%20%28novel%29">Doctor Zhivago</a>" phenomenon of 1958: "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed."

At least a dozen recordings were issued in the wake of the success of the Nonesuch recording, and the work enjoyed significant exposure in a number of artistic media worldwide. The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow, including as an accompaniment to a plane crash in <a href="Peter%20Weir">Peter Weir</a>'s "<a href="Fearless%20%281993%20film%29">Fearless</a>" (1993), and in the soundtrack to <a href="Julian%20Schnabel">Julian Schnabel</a>'s "<a href="Basquiat%20%28film%29">Basquiat</a>" (1996). An art gallery in <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a> opened an exhibit in 1995 dedicated entirely to visual art inspired by the piece.. On June 24, 2018, in an unprecedented gesture, the host of SiriusXM followed a playing of the Zinman/Upshaw recording by asking the listeners to consider parallels between the theme of the texts referencing the separation of mothers and children to the then current political situation.

Spinning Around

"Spinning Around" is a song recorded by Australian singer <a href="Kylie%20Minogue">Kylie Minogue</a> for her seventh <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a>, "<a href="Light%20Years%20%28Kylie%20Minogue%20album%29">Light Years</a>" (2000). It won the 2000 <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202000">ARIA Music Award</a> for Best Pop Release. Written by Ira Shickman, Osborne Bingham, <a href="Kara%20DioGuardi">Kara DioGuardi</a>, and <a href="Paula%20Abdul">Paula Abdul</a>, "Spinning Around" was initially meant to be recorded by Abdul for her own album, but was given to Minogue after the plan never came to fruition. Produced by <a href="Mike%20Spencer">Mike Spencer</a>, the <a href="disco">disco</a>-influenced <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> song was then released as the <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> from "Light Years" on 19 June 2000. Lyrically, the song addresses the theme of reinvention, with Minogue claiming that she has changed as a person and learned from the past.

Upon its release, "Spinning Around" received favourable reviews from <a href="music%20critics">music critics</a>, who singled it out as one of the highlights from the album and praised Minogue for returning to her signature musical style. Commercially, the song was a success and became Minogue's "<a href="wikt%3Acomeback">comeback</a>" single following the critical and commercial disappointment of her sixth studio album "<a href="Impossible%20Princess">Impossible Princess</a>" (1997). It entered the <a href="Australian%20Singles%20Chart">Australian Singles Chart</a> at number one, becoming the singer's first chart-topper since "<a href="Confide%20in%20Me">Confide in Me</a>" (1994). The song also debuted at number one in the United Kingdom, where it became her first single to peak atop the chart since "<a href="Tears%20on%20My%20Pillow">Tears on My Pillow</a>" in 1990. Elsewhere, it reached the top five in Ireland and New Zealand. "Spinning Around" was <a href="Record%20certification">certified</a> <a href="Platinum%20certification">platinum</a> and <a href="Silver%20certification">silver</a> in Australia and the United Kingdom, respectively.

The accompanying music video for "Spinning Around" was directed by <a href="Dawn%20Shadforth">Dawn Shadforth</a>, and features Minogue dancing and enjoying herself in a disco. It became popular for the gold <a href="hotpants">hotpants</a> she sported in most of the scenes and led to her bottom gaining extensive coverage from the media. The hotpants are considered to be "iconic" and have been displayed in exhibitions of Minogue's fashion. "Spinning Around" has been performed by Minogue during all of her concert tours, with the exception of the <a href="Anti%20Tour">Anti Tour</a>.

In 1997, Minogue released her sixth studio album, "<a href="Impossible%20Princess">Impossible Princess</a>". The album represented a drastic change in the singer's musical direction, shifting from her signature <a href="dance-pop">dance-pop</a> styles to incorporate elements of <a href="electronica">electronica</a> and <a href="pop%20rock">pop rock</a>. It was her second album to be released on British record label <a href="Deconstruction%20Records">Deconstruction</a> and became a success in her native Australia, peaking at number four on the <a href="ARIA%20Albums%20Chart">ARIA Albums Chart</a>. In the United Kingdom "Impossible Princess" was less successful than Minogue's previous albums and peaked at number ten on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>. The album also suffered from poor reviews in the UK as commentators criticised its different musical approach; many also considered that Minogue's career was over. Despite embarking on a successful <a href="Intimate%20and%20Live%20%28concert%20tour%29">promotional tour</a>, Minogue was dropped by Deconstruction in 1999. Minogue then signed to <a href="Parlophone">Parlophone</a>, another British record label.

After various discussions, Minogue decided to do what she did "best" and record a simple <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a> album inspired by <a href="disco">disco</a> and <a href="Europop">Europop</a>, entitled "<a href="Light%20Years%20%28Kylie%20Minogue%20album%29">Light Years</a>". "Spinning Around" was included as the opening track of the album and was written by Ira Shickman, Osborne Bingham, <a href="Kara%20DioGuardi">Kara DioGuardi</a> and <a href="Paula%20Abdul">Paula Abdul</a>, and produced by <a href="Mike%20Spencer">Mike Spencer</a>. Abdul had based the song on her divorce from clothing designer Brad Beckerman and had originally intended to record it for her own studio album, but it was given to Minogue after the album failed to materialise. The song was the first major songwriting project for DioGuardi, who had not been offered any notable projects previously. In an interview discussing the development of "Light Years", Minogue revealed that the song had initially been found as a <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> in New York by her <a href="A%26amp%3BR">A&R</a> executive Jamie Nelson, who believed it would be "perfect" for the singer. After listening to the demo, Minogue agreed to record it and felt the song had the potential to be a hit. "Spinning Around" was then released as the <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> from the album on 13 June 2000 in Australia, and 19 June in the United Kingdom. Minogue was photographed by Liz Collins for the artwork of the record. In her 2012 fashion retrospective book "<a href="Kylie%20/%20Fashion">Kylie / Fashion</a>", she wrote of the collaboration: "With 'Spinning Around' it was time to be pop-tastic again. Liz Collins's aesthetic was very much about a natural beauty."

Similar to most of the songs from "Light Years", "Spinning Around" is a "<a href="String%20instrument">string</a>-laden" dance-pop track with prominent influences from disco music. According to the <a href="sheet%20music">sheet music</a> of the song published by <a href="BMG%20Rights%20Management">BMG Rights Management</a> at Musicnotes.com, it is composed in the key of <a href="F-sharp%20minor">F minor</a> and features a moderate <a href="Tempo%20%28music%29">tempo</a> of 120 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the low note of F to the high note of C. Addressing the theme of reinvention, the lyrics declare that Minogue has changed and learned from her past mistakes; it contains lines like "I'm spinning around/Move out of my way ... I'm not the same" and "Mistakes that I made have given me the strength to really believe." In an analysis of the lyrics of the song, Pom Avoledo from <a href="Blogcritics">Blogcritics</a> wrote that Minogue demands attention in the chorus towards the changes in her personality and asserts that people appreciate them, in the line "I know you're feelin[g] me [be]cause you like it like this." The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh, evidenced in lines like "Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe." The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is. The <a href="Bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a> of the song features the repetition of the hook "You know you like it like this," with Minogue's voice being <a href="Vocoder">vocoded</a>. Chris True from <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> felt that through the lyrics, Minogue was admitting that releasing "Impossible Princess" in 1997 was not the best decision.

"Spinning Around" received favourable reviews from <a href="music%20critics">music critics</a>. Chris True from AllMusic selected it as a highlight from the album and said it was a "fun and string-laden declaration that she may have made a mistake back in 1997." Pom Avoledo praised Minogue for returning to her signature dance-pop style and complimented her for giving "Spinning Around" an "air of elegance and sensuality which was lacking in her early material." A very positive review came from Siobhan Grogan of "<a href="NME">NME</a>", who favoured the chorus of the song and commended Minogue for coming back to "what she knows best." The critic felt the song would become a hit in <a href="gay%20clubs">gay clubs</a> and commented that "[Spinning Around] is made of the same fizzing, giddy disco-pop that made Kylie famous in the first place." Gary Crossing from <a href="Yahoo%21%20Music">Yahoo! Music</a>, who gave "Light Years" a mixed review, felt that "Spinning Around" was one of the better tracks from the album and called it a "slinky little number."

In his review of Minogue's 2004 <a href="greatest%20hits%20album">greatest hits album</a> "<a href="Ultimate%20Kylie">Ultimate Kylie</a>", Jason Shawahn from <a href="About.com">About.com</a> praised the inclusion of songs like "Spinning Around" and other tracks from "Light Years", calling them "a blessing for domestic music consumers, since that disc has never found its way onto official US release, though with any collection of Minogue hits, one simply has to look at what they have in their collection versus what they don't." At the 14th <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202000">ARIA Music Awards</a> ceremony in 2000, "Spinning Around" won the award for "Best Pop Release". "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"s Jason Lipshutz wrote the track found the singer "returning to straightforward pop after 1997's ambitious "Impossible Princess" and corralling some disco thump to create an especially giddy effect"; calling it one of Minogue's "most effortless hits to date". Louis Vartel from the <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> oriented website "NewNownext", called it her "coolest, most liberated dance opus". He placed it at number seven of his list of the singer's 48 greatest songs, in honor of her 48th birthday.

The song was a commercial success. In Australia it was <a href="Record%20certification">certified</a> <a href="Gold%20certification">gold</a> by the <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Australian Recording Industry Association</a> (ARIA) prior to its release on the strength of pre-orders. On the chart date of 2 July 2000, it debuted at number one on the <a href="ARIA%20Singles%20Chart">ARIA Singles Chart</a>. The following week, it dropped to number five and it stayed in the top ten for four consecutive weeks in total. It was Minogue's first number one single in the country since "<a href="Confide%20in%20Me">Confide in Me</a>", which was released six years earlier. "Spinning Around" charted for a total of 12 weeks and was later certified <a href="Platinum%20certification">platinum</a> by the ARIA for shipments of 70,000 units. The song also performed well in New Zealand, entering the <a href="RIANZ%20Singles%20Chart">RIANZ Singles Chart</a> at number eight and peaking at number two. It spent a total of 17 weeks on the chart and was certified gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20New%20Zealand">Recording Industry Association of New Zealand</a> (RIANZ) for sales of 7,500 units.

With first-week sales of over 80,000 units, "Spinning Around" debuted atop the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> on the chart date of 1 July 2000, becoming Minogue's first number one single in a decade. Her previous chart-topping single was "<a href="Tears%20on%20My%20Pillow">Tears on My Pillow</a>" from her second studio album "<a href="Enjoy%20Yourself%20%28Kylie%20Minogue%20album%29">Enjoy Yourself</a>" (1989). "Spinning Around" was Minogue's fifth number one single in the United Kingdom. Minogue became one of only two artists to have a number one single in three consecutive decades, achieving this in the <a href="1980s%20in%20music">1980s</a>, <a href="1990s%20in%20music">1990s</a>, and <a href="2000s%20in%20music">2000s</a>. The other artist to hold this distinction is <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>, whose song "<a href="American%20Pie%20%28Madonna%20cover%29">American Pie</a>" topped the UK singles chart in March 2000. "Spinning Around" charted inside the top ten for two weeks and inside the top forty for eight weeks. The <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> (BPI) certified the song <a href="Silver%20certification">silver</a> for shipments of 200,000 units. As of March 2014, the single has sold 300,000 units in the country according to the Official Charts Company. "Spinning Around" was deemed a successful "<a href="wikt%3Acomeback">comeback</a>" single for Minogue and, along with parent album "Light Years", helped relaunch her career.

The accompanying <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for "Spinning Around" was directed by <a href="Dawn%20Shadforth">Dawn Shadforth</a>. As the song was meant to be Minogue's "<a href="wikt%3Acomeback">comeback</a>" single and mark a "decisive return" to pop music following "Impossible Princess", the video did not contain any dark themes and put the "emphasis firmly upon dance, fun, and freedom." The video begins with a shot of Minogue's feet as she enters a disco-like setting. She is then shown dancing on the floor with a man, whom she later flirts with on a sofa. Scenes of her performing a dance routine on and in front of a bar and laying on neon blue and gold lights are interspersed throughout the video. Most of the shots are focused on Minogue's body and various scenes feature her wearing gold <a href="Lam%C3%A9%20%28fabric%29">lamé</a> <a href="hotpants">hotpants</a>.

Following its release, the music video became popular for the gold hotpants Minogue sported. It resulted in a media sensation regarding her bottom. British national broadsheet newspaper "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" deemed her bottom a "wonder of nature" and "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" sponsored a campaign to "have Kylie Minogue's rear-end <a href="heritage-listed">heritage-listed</a>, preserved for "posteriority" on the grounds that it's an <a href="Area%20of%20Outstanding%20Natural%20Beauty">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a>." Readers were requested by the tabloid newspaper to persuade the government to make sure "[Minogue's] bum remains in safe hands - by turning it into a national institution." Rumours and speculations claiming Minogue had undergone plastic surgery to make her bottom look more appealing also began to arise during this time. In the same year, English broadcaster and journalist <a href="Johnny%20Vaughan">Johnny Vaughan</a> commented "if an alien landed on Earth he would think Kylie's arse is the world's leader." Minogue's stylist and close friend <a href="William%20Baker%20%28fashion%20designer%29">William Baker</a> explained his decision to "showcase" her bottom in the video, saying "Kylie's bottom is like a peach - sex sells and her best asset is her bum." The singer's response to the attention regarding her bottom was "dry," claiming "You never know what the future holds. It could become a pear." It was reported that Minogue had her bottom <a href="Insurance">insured</a> for five million dollars.

The hotpants were deemed "iconic" and were said to be the reason behind "Spinning Around" becoming a "musical and visual anthem in 2000." According to the catalogue entry for the hotpants at the Performing Arts Collection at the Arts Centre, Melbourne, British artist and photographer <a href="Katerina%20Jebb">Katerina Jebb</a> bought them for <a href="Fifty%20pence%20%28British%20coin%29">fifty pence</a> from a <a href="flea%20market">flea market</a> and they were only selected for use in the video the night before the shoot, though Minogue had worn them previously for a website photoshoot. She was surprised by the attention they attracted, commenting "I never imagined what impact a 50p pair of hotpants would have." She also said that the revealing nature of the hotpants made her feel insecure during the shooting, saying "I actually wasn't confident [in them], that's the crazy thing. I remember feeling quite self-conscious and kept wrapping a robe around me on set and would discard [it] right before the take." The garment is often referred to as "those hotpants," and have become a symbol for the singer's vitality and youthfulness. Considered to be one of her trademark looks, the attire she wore in the music video was put on display at "Kylie: The Exhibition", an exhibition that featured "costumes and memorabilia collected over Kylie's career", held at the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> in London, England, and at "Kylie: An Exhibition", a similar exhibition held at the <a href="Powerhouse%20Museum">Powerhouse Museum</a> in Sydney, Australia. It was also included in Minogue's official fashion photography book "<a href="Kylie%20/%20Fashion">Kylie / Fashion</a>", which was released on 19 November 2012 by <a href="Thames%20and%20Hudson">Thames and Hudson</a> to celebrate Minogue's completion of . In February 2014, Minogue donated the hotpants to the <a href="Performing%20Arts%20Collection">Performing Arts Collection</a> museum at the <a href="Arts%20Centre%20Melbourne">Arts Centre</a> in her hometown of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>.

On 30 June 2000, Minogue performed "Spinning Around" on British music chart television programme "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>". She performed the song for the second time on the programme on 7 July. On 18 October 2000,Minogue performed the song on the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Paralympics">2000 Summer Paralympics</a> Opening Ceremonies,along Waltizing Matilda and Celebration.
On 2 August 2001, Minogue performed "Spinning Around" at the <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> "One Big Sunday" show held at <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, in the United Kingdom, along with "<a href="Can%27t%20Get%20You%20Out%20of%20My%20Head">Can't Get You Out of My Head</a>"; for the performance, she wore a black <a href="trilby">trilby</a> hat, sleeveless T-shirt (with a picture of <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> printed on it), knee length black boots, and trousers with open zips placed on both the thighs. "Spinning Around" was included on the "On Yer Bike" act of Minogue's one-off concert show <a href="Money%20Can%27t%20Buy">Money Can't Buy</a>, which was held on 15 November 2003. On 4 June 2012, she sang "Spinning Around" at the <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee%20Concert">Diamond Jubilee Concert</a> in front of the <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, held in honour of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>.

Byzantine navy

The Byzantine navy was the <a href="navy">naval force</a> of the East Roman or <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. Like the empire it served, it was a direct continuation from its <a href="Roman%20navy">Imperial Roman predecessor</a>, but played a far greater role in the defence and survival of the state than its earlier iteration. While the fleets of the unified <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> faced few great naval threats, operating as a policing force vastly inferior in power and prestige to the <a href="Roman%20legion">legions</a>, the sea became vital to the very existence of the Byzantine state, which several historians have called a "maritime empire".

The first threat to Roman hegemony in the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> was posed by the <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a> in the 5th century, but their threat was ended by the wars of <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> in the 6th century. The re-establishment of a permanently maintained fleet and the introduction of the "<a href="dromon">dromon</a>" galley in the same period also marks the point when the Byzantine navy began departing from its late Roman roots and developing its own characteristic identity. This process would be furthered with the onset of the <a href="Muslim%20conquests">Muslim conquests</a> in the 7th century. Following the loss of the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> and later Africa, the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> was transformed from a "Roman lake" into a battleground between Byzantines and Arabs. In this struggle, the Byzantine fleets were critical, not only for the defence of the Empire's far-flung possessions around the Mediterranean basin, but also for repelling seaborne attacks against the imperial capital of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> itself. Through the use of the newly invented "<a href="Greek%20fire">Greek fire</a>", the Byzantine navy's best-known and feared secret weapon, Constantinople was saved from several <a href="Sieges%20of%20Constantinople">sieges</a> and numerous naval engagements were won for the Byzantines.

Initially, the defence of the Byzantine coasts and the approaches to Constantinople was borne by the great fleet of the "<a href="Karabisianoi">Karabisianoi</a>". Progressively however it was split up into several regional (<a href="Theme%20%28Byzantine%20district%29">thematic</a>) fleets, while a central Imperial Fleet was maintained at Constantinople, guarding the city and forming the core of naval expeditions. By the late 8th century, the Byzantine navy, a well-organized and maintained force, was again the dominant maritime power in the Mediterranean. The antagonism with the Muslim navies continued with alternating success, but in the 10th century, the Byzantines were able to recover a position of supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean.

During the 11th century, the navy, like the Empire itself, began to decline. Faced with new naval challenges from the West, the Byzantines were increasingly forced to rely on the navies of Italian city-states like <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venice</a> and <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoa</a>, with disastrous effects on Byzantium's economy and sovereignty. A period of <a href="Komnenian%20restoration">recovery under the Komnenians</a> was followed by another period of decline, which culminated in the disastrous dissolution of the Empire by the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a> in 1204. After the Empire was restored in 1261, several emperors of the <a href="Byzantium%20under%20the%20Palaiologoi">Palaiologan dynasty</a> tried to revive the navy, but their efforts had only a temporary effect. By the mid-14th century, the Byzantine fleet, which once could put hundreds of warships to sea, was limited to a few dozen at best, and control of the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a> passed definitively to the Italian and <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> navies. The diminished navy, however, continued to be active until the <a href="Fall%20of%20Constantinople">fall of the Byzantine Empire</a> to the Ottomans in 1453.

The Byzantine navy, like the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire itself, was a continuation of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> and its institutions. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Battle of Actium</a> in 31 BC, in the absence of any external threat in the Mediterranean, the Roman navy performed mostly policing and escort duties. Massive sea battles, like those fought in the <a href="Punic%20Wars">Punic Wars</a>, no longer occurred, and the Roman fleets were composed of relatively small vessels, best suited to their new tasks. By the early 4th century, the permanent Roman fleets had dwindled, so that when the fleets of the rival emperors <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a> and <a href="Licinius">Licinius</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Hellespont">clashed in 324 AD</a>, they were composed to a great extent of newly built or commandeered ships from the port cities of the Eastern Mediterranean. The civil wars of the 4th and early 5th centuries, however, did spur a revival of naval activity, with fleets mostly employed to transport armies. Considerable naval forces continued to be employed in the Western Mediterranean throughout the first quarter of the fifth century, especially from North Africa, but Rome's mastery of the Mediterranean was challenged when Africa was overrun by the <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a> over a period of fifteen years.

The new <a href="Vandalic%20Kingdom">Vandalic Kingdom</a> of <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>, under the capable king <a href="Geiseric">Geiseric</a>, immediately launched raids against the coasts of Italy and Greece, even <a href="Sack%20of%20Rome%20%28455%29">sacking and plundering</a> Rome in 455. The Vandal raids continued unabated over the next two decades, despite repeated Roman attempts to defeat them. The Western Empire was impotent, its navy having dwindled to almost nothing, but the eastern emperors could still call upon the resources and naval expertise of the eastern Mediterranean. A first Eastern expedition in 448, however, went no further than Sicily, and in 460, the Vandals attacked and destroyed a Western Roman invasion fleet at <a href="Cartagena%2C%20Spain">Cartagena</a> in Spain. Finally, in 468, a huge Eastern expedition was assembled under <a href="Basiliscus">Basiliscus</a>, reputedly numbering 1,113 ships and 100,000 men, but it failed disastrously. About 600 ships were lost to <a href="fire%20ship">fire ship</a>s, and the financial cost of 130,000 pounds of gold and 700 000 pounds of silver nearly bankrupted the Empire. This forced the Romans to come to terms with Geiseric and sign a peace treaty. After Geiseric's death in 477, however, the Vandal threat receded.

The 6th century marked the rebirth of Roman naval power. In 508, as antagonism with the <a href="Ostrogothic%20Kingdom">Ostrogothic Kingdom</a> of <a href="Theodoric%20the%20Great">Theodoric</a> flared up, the Emperor <a href="Anastasius%20I%20%28emperor%29">Anastasius I</a> (491–518) is reported to have sent a fleet of 100 warships to raid the coasts of Italy. In 513, the general <a href="Vitalian%20%28general%29">Vitalian</a> revolted against Anastasius. The rebels assembled a fleet of 200 ships which, despite some initial successes, were destroyed by admiral <a href="Marinus%20%28praetorian%20prefect%29">Marinus</a>, who employed a sulphur-based incendiary substance to defeat them.

In 533, taking advantage of the absence of the Vandal fleet, sent to suppress a revolt in <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, an army of 15,000 under <a href="Belisarius">Belisarius</a> was transported to Africa by an invasion fleet of 92 <a href="dromon">dromon</a>s and 500 transports, beginning the <a href="Vandalic%20War">Vandalic War</a>, the first of the wars of reconquest of Emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> (527–565). These were largely amphibious operations, made possible by the control of the Mediterranean waterways, and the fleet played a vital role in carrying supplies and reinforcements to the widely dispersed Byzantine expeditionary forces and garrisons. This fact was not lost on the Byzantines' enemies. Already in the 520s, Theodoric had planned to build a massive fleet directed against the Byzantines and the Vandals, but his death in 526 limited the extent to which these plans were realized. In 535, the <a href="Gothic%20War%20%28535%E2%80%93554%29">Gothic War</a> began with a double-pronged Byzantine offensive, with a fleet again carrying Belisarius' army to Sicily and then Italy, and another army invading <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>. Byzantine control of the sea was of great strategic importance, allowing the smaller Byzantine army to successfully occupy the peninsula by 540.

In 541 however, the new Ostrogoth king, <a href="Totila">Totila</a>, created a fleet of 400 warships with which to deny the seas around Italy to the Empire. Two Byzantine fleets were destroyed near Naples in 542, and in 546, Belisarius personally commanded 200 ships against the Gothic fleet that blockaded the mouths of the <a href="Tiber">Tiber</a>, in an unsuccessful effort to <a href="Sack%20of%20Rome%20%28546%29">relieve Rome</a>. In 550, Totila invaded Sicily, and over the next year, his 300-ship fleet captured Sardinia and <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, and raided <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> and the coast of <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a>. However, a defeat in a sea battle off <a href="Battle%20of%20Sena%20Gallica%20%28551%29">Sena Gallica</a> marked the beginning of the final Imperial ascendancy. With the final conquest of Italy and <a href="Spania">southern Spain</a> under Justinian, the Mediterranean once again became a "Roman lake".

Despite the subsequent loss of much of Italy to the <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a>, the Byzantines maintained control of the seas around the peninsula. As the Lombards rarely ventured to sea, the Byzantines were able to retain several coastal strips of Italian territory for centuries. The only major naval action of the next 80 years occurred during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%28626%29">Siege of Constantinople</a> by the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid Persians</a>, <a href="Avars%20%28Carpathians%29">Avars</a> and Slavs in 626. During that siege, the Slavs' fleet of "<a href="monoxyla">monoxyla</a>" was intercepted by the Byzantine fleet and destroyed, denying the <a href="Sassanid%20army">Persian army</a> passage across the <a href="Bosporus">Bosporus</a> and eventually forcing the Avars to retreat.

During the 640s, the <a href="Muslim%20conquest">Muslim conquest</a> of <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> created a new threat to Byzantium. Not only did the Arabs conquer significant recruiting and revenue-producing areas, but, after the utility of a strong navy was demonstrated by the short-lived Byzantine recapture of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in 644, they took to creating a navy of their own. In this effort the new Muslim elite, which came from the inland-oriented northern part of the <a href="Arabian%20peninsula">Arabian peninsula</a>, largely relied on the resources and manpower of the conquered <a href="Levant">Levant</a> (especially the <a href="Copts">Copts</a> of Egypt), which until a few years previously had provided ships and crews for the Byzantines. There is, however, evidence that in the new naval bases in Palestine shipwrights from Persia and Iraq were also employed. The lack of illustrations earlier than the 14th century means that nothing is known about the specifics of the early Muslim warships, although it is usually assumed that their naval efforts drew upon the existing Mediterranean maritime tradition. Given a largely shared nautical nomenclature, and the centuries-long interaction between the two cultures, Byzantine and Arab ships shared many similarities. This similarity also extended to tactics and general fleet organization; translations of <a href="Byzantine%20military%20manuals">Byzantine military manuals</a> were available to the Arab admirals.

After seizing <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> in 649 and raiding Rhodes, Crete and Sicily, the young Arab navy decisively defeated the Byzantines under the personal command of Emperor <a href="Constans%20II">Constans II</a> (641–668) in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Masts">Battle of the Masts</a> of 655. This catastrophic Byzantine defeat opened up the Mediterranean to the Arabs, and began a centuries-long series of naval conflicts over the control of the Mediterranean waterways. From the reign of <a href="Muawiyah%20I">Muawiyah I</a> (661–680), raids intensified, as preparations were made for a great assault on Constantinople itself. In the long <a href="Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%28674%E2%80%93678%29">first Arab siege</a> of Constantinople, the Byzantine fleet proved instrumental to the survival of the Empire: the Arab fleets were defeated through the use of its newly developed secret weapon, "<a href="Greek%20fire">Greek fire</a>". The Muslim advance in Asia Minor and the Aegean was halted, and an agreement to a thirty-year truce concluded soon after.

In the 680s, <a href="Justinian%20II">Justinian II</a> (685–695 and 705–711) paid attention to the needs of the navy, strengthening it by the resettlement of over 18,500 <a href="Mardaites">Mardaites</a> along the southern coasts of the Empire, where they were employed as <a href="Marine%20%28military%29">marines</a> and rowers. Nevertheless, the Arab naval threat intensified as they <a href="Umayyad%20conquest%20of%20North%20Africa">gradually took control</a> of <a href="Exarchate%20of%20Africa">North Africa</a> in the 680s and 690s. The last Byzantine stronghold, Carthage, fell in 698, although a Byzantine naval expedition managed to <a href="Battle%20of%20Carthage%20%28698%29">briefly retake it</a>. The Arab governor <a href="Musa%20bin%20Nusair">Musa bin Nusair</a> built a new city and naval base at <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a>, and 1,000 Coptic shipwrights were brought to construct a new fleet, which would challenge Byzantine control of the western Mediterranean. Thus, from the early 8th century on, Muslim raids unfolded unceasingly against Byzantine holdings in the Western Mediterranean, especially Sicily. In addition, the new fleet would allow the Muslims to complete their conquest of the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> and to <a href="Umayyad%20conquest%20of%20Hispania">successfully invade and capture</a> most of the Visigoth-controlled Iberian Peninsula.

The Byzantines were unable to respond effectively to the Muslim advance in Africa, because the two decades between 695 and 715 were a <a href="Twenty%20Years%27%20Anarchy">period of great domestic turmoil</a>. They did react with raids of their own in the East, such as the one in 709 against Egypt which captured the local admiral, but they also were aware of a coming onslaught: as Caliph <a href="al-Walid%20I">al-Walid I</a> (705–715) readied his forces for a renewed assault against Constantinople, Emperor <a href="Anastasios%20II%20%28emperor%29">Anastasios II</a> (713–715) prepared the capital, and mounted an unsuccessful pre-emptive strike against the Muslim naval preparations. Anastasios was soon overthrown by <a href="Theodosius%20III">Theodosius III</a> (715–717), who in turn was replaced, just as the Muslim army was advancing through Anatolia, by <a href="Leo%20III%20the%20Isaurian">Leo III the Isaurian</a> (717–741). It was Leo III who faced the second and final <a href="Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%28717%E2%80%93718%29">Arab siege of Constantinople</a>. The use of Greek fire, which devastated the Arab fleet, was again instrumental in the Byzantine victory, while a harsh winter and <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgar</a> attacks further sapped the besiegers' strength.

In the aftermath of the siege, the retreating remains of the Arab fleet were decimated in a storm, and Byzantine forces launched a counter-offensive, with a fleet sacking <a href="Latakia">Laodicea</a> and an army driving the Arabs from Asia Minor. For the next three decades, naval warfare featured constant raids from both sides, with the Byzantines launching repeated attacks against the Muslim naval bases in Syria (Laodicea), and Egypt (<a href="Damietta">Damietta</a> and <a href="Tinnis">Tinnis</a>). In 727, a revolt of the thematic fleets, largely motivated by resentment against the Emperor's iconoclasm, was put down by the imperial fleet through use of Greek fire. Despite the losses this entailed, some 390 warships were reportedly sent to attack Damietta in 739, and in 746 the Byzantines decisively defeated the Alexandrian fleet at <a href="Battle%20of%20Keramaia">Keramaia</a> in Cyprus, breaking the naval power of the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a>.

The Byzantines followed this up with the destruction of the North African flotillas, and coupled their successes at sea with severe trading limitations imposed on Muslim traders. Given the Empire's new ability to control the waterways, this strangled Muslim maritime trade. With the collapse of the Umayyad state shortly thereafter and the increasing fragmentation of the Muslim world, the Byzantine navy was left as the sole organized naval force in the Mediterranean. Thus, during the latter half of the 8th century, the Byzantines enjoyed a second period of complete naval superiority. It is no coincidence that in the many <a href="Islamic%20eschatology">Islamic apocalyptic texts</a> composed and transmitted during the first and second Islamic centuries, the <a href="End%20Times">End Times</a> are preceded by a seaborne Byzantine invasion. Many traditions from the period stress that manning the guard posts ("ribāṭ") on the coasts of Syria is tantamount to partaking in the "<a href="jihad">jihād</a>", and authorities like <a href="Abu%20Hurayrah">Abu Hurayrah</a> were cited as considering one day of "ribāṭ" more pious an act than a night of prayer in the <a href="Kaaba">Kaaba</a>.

These successes enabled Emperor <a href="Constantine%20V">Constantine V</a> (741–775) to shift the fleet from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea during his campaigns against the Bulgars in the 760s. In 763, a fleet of 800 ships carrying 9,600 cavalry and some infantry sailed to <a href="Pomorie">Anchialus</a>, where he scored a significant <a href="Battle%20of%20Anchialus%20%28763%29">victory</a>, but in 766, a second fleet, allegedly of 2,600 ships, again bound for Anchialus, sank "en route". At the same time however, the <a href="Isaurian%20dynasty">Isaurian</a> emperors undermined Byzantium's naval strength: with the Arab threat gone for the moment, and with the largely <a href="iconodule">iconodule</a> naval themes staunchly opposed to their <a href="Byzantine%20Iconoclasm">iconoclastic policies</a>, the emperors reduced the navy's size and downgraded the naval themes.

The Byzantine naval predominance lasted until the early 9th century, when a succession of disasters at the hands of the resurgent Muslim fleets spelled its end and inaugurated an era that would represent the zenith of Muslim ascendancy. Already in 790, the Byzantines suffered a major defeat in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Antalya">Gulf of Antalya</a>, and raids against Cyprus and Crete recommenced during the reign of <a href="Harun%20al-Rashid">Harun al-Rashid</a> (786–809). Around the Mediterranean, new powers were rising, foremost amongst them the <a href="Carolingian%20Empire">Carolingian Empire</a>, while in 803, the "<a href="Pax%20Nicephori">Pax Nicephori</a>" recognized the "de facto" independence of Byzantine <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venice</a>, which was further entrenched by the repulsion of a Byzantine attack in 809. At the same time, in <a href="Ifriqiya">Ifriqiya</a>, the new <a href="Aghlabid">Aghlabid</a> dynasty was established, which immediately engaged in raids throughout the central Mediterranean.

The Byzantines, on the other hand, were weakened by a series of catastrophic defeats against the Bulgars, followed in 820 by the <a href="Revolt%20of%20Thomas%20the%20Slav">Revolt of Thomas the Slav</a>, which attracted the support of a large part of the Byzantine armed forces, including the thematic fleets. Despite its suppression, the revolt had severely depleted the Empire's defences. As a result, <a href="Crete">Crete</a> fell between 824 and 827 to a band of <a href="al-Andalus">Andalusian</a> exiles. Three successive Byzantine recovery attempts failed over the next few years, and the island became a base for Muslim piratical activity in the Aegean, radically upsetting the balance of power in the region. Despite some Byzantine successes over the Cretan corsairs, and the <a href="Sack%20of%20Damietta%20%28853%29">razing</a> of Damietta by a Byzantine fleet of 85 ships in 853, Arab naval power in the Levant was steadily reviving under Abbasid rule. Further Byzantine attempts to recover Crete, in 843 and 866, were complete failures.
The situation was even worse in the West. A critical blow was inflicted on the Empire in 827, as the Aghlabids began the slow <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Sicily">conquest of Sicily</a>, aided by the defection of the Byzantine commander <a href="Euphemius%20%28Sicily%29">Euphemios</a> and the island's thematic fleet. In 838, the Muslims crossed over into Italy, taking <a href="Taranto">Taranto</a> and <a href="Brindisi">Brindisi</a>, followed soon by <a href="Emirate%20of%20Bari">Bari</a>. Venetian operations against them were unsuccessful, and throughout the 840s, the Arabs were freely raiding Italy and the Adriatic, even <a href="Arab%20raid%20against%20Rome">attacking Rome</a> in 846. Attacks by the Lombards and <a href="Lothair%20I">Lothair I</a> failed to dislodge the Muslims from Italy, while two large-scale Byzantine attempts to recover Sicily were heavily defeated in 840 and 859. By 850, the Muslim fleets, together with large numbers of independent "<a href="Ghazi%20warriors">ghazi</a>" raiders, had emerged as the major power of the Mediterranean, putting the Byzantines and the Christians in general on the defensive.

The same period, when a battered Byzantium defended itself against enemies on all fronts, also saw the emergence of a new, unexpected threat: the <a href="Rus%27%20%28people%29">Rus'</a> made their first appearance in Byzantine history with a <a href="Paphlagonian%20expedition%20of%20the%20Rus">raid against Paphlagonia</a> in the 830s, followed by a <a href="Rus%27%E2%80%93Byzantine%20War%20%28860%29">major expedition</a> in 860.

During the course of the later 9th and the 10th century, as the Caliphate fractured into smaller states and Arab power became weakened, the Byzantines launched a series of successful campaigns against them. This "Byzantine Reconquest" was overseen by the able sovereigns of the <a href="Macedonian%20dynasty">Macedonian dynasty</a> (867–1056), and marked the noontide of the Byzantine state.

The ascension of Emperor <a href="Basil%20I">Basil I</a> (867–886) heralded this revival, as he embarked on an aggressive foreign policy. Continuing the policies of his predecessor, <a href="Michael%20III">Michael III</a> (842–867), he showed great care to the fleet, and as a result, successive victories followed. In 868, a fleet under the "droungarios tou plōïmou" <a href="Niketas%20Ooryphas">Niketas Ooryphas</a> relieved <a href="Ragusa%20%28Croatia%29">Ragusa</a> from an <a href="Siege%20of%20Ragusa%20%28866%E2%80%93868%29">Arab siege</a> and <a href="Dalmatia%20%28theme%29">re-established Byzantine presence</a> in the area. A few years later, he twice heavily defeated the Cretan pirates at <a href="Battle%20of%20Kardia">Kardia</a> and in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Corinth">Corinthian Gulf</a>, temporarily securing the Aegean. Cyprus also was temporarily recovered and <a href="Bari">Bari</a> occupied. At the same time, however, the Muslim presence in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a> was strengthened, and <a href="Tarsos">Tarsos</a> became a major base for land and seaborne attacks against Byzantine territory, especially under the famed emir <a href="Yazaman%20al-Khadim">Yazaman al-Khadim</a> (882–891), despite the <a href="Siege%20of%20Euripos">heavy defeat</a> of one of his raids before <a href="Chalcis">Euripos</a>.

In the West, the Muslims continued to make steady advances, as the local Byzantine forces proved inadequate: the Empire was forced to rely on the aid of their nominal Italian subjects, and had to resort to the transfer of the eastern fleets to Italy to achieve any progress. Following the fall of <a href="Enna">Enna</a> in 855, the Byzantines were confined to the eastern shore of Sicily, and under increasing pressure. A relief expedition in 868 achieved little. <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a> was attacked again in 869, and in 870, <a href="Malta">Malta</a> fell to the Aghlabids. Muslim corsairs raided the Adriatic, and although they were driven out of <a href="Apulia">Apulia</a>, in the early 880s they established bases along the western Italian coast, from where they would not be completely dislodged until 915. In 878, Syracuse, the main Byzantine stronghold in Sicily, was attacked again and fell, largely because the Imperial Fleet was occupied with transporting <a href="marble">marble</a> for the construction of the "<a href="Nea%20Ekklesia">Nea Ekklesia</a>", Basil's new church. In 880, Ooryphas' successor, the "droungarios" <a href="Nasar">Nasar</a>, scored a significant victory in a <a href="Battle%20of%20Cephalonia">night battle</a> over the Aghlabids who were raiding the <a href="Ionian%20Islands">Ionian Islands</a>. He then proceeded to raid Sicily, carrying off much booty, before <a href="Battle%20of%20Stelai">defeating</a> another Muslim fleet off <a href="Punta%20Stilo">Punta Stilo</a>. At the same time, another Byzantine squadron scored a significant victory at Naples. These successes allowed a short-lived Byzantine counter-offensive to develop in the West in the 870s and 880s under <a href="Nikephoros%20Phokas%20the%20Elder">Nikephoros Phokas the Elder</a>, expanding the Byzantine foothold in Apulia and <a href="Calabria">Calabria</a> and forming the "thema" of <a href="Longobardia">Longobardia</a>, which would later evolve into the <a href="Catepanate%20of%20Italy">Catepanate of Italy</a>. A <a href="Battle%20of%20Milazzo%20%28888%29">heavy defeat</a> off <a href="Milazzo">Milazzo</a> in 888, however, signalled the virtual disappearance of major Byzantine naval activity in the seas around Italy for the next century.

Despite the successes under Basil, during the reign of his successor <a href="Leo%20VI%20the%20Wise">Leo VI the Wise</a> (886–912), the Empire again faced serious threats. In the north, a war broke out against the Bulgarian Tsar <a href="Simeon%20I%20of%20Bulgaria">Simeon</a>, and a part of the Imperial Fleet was used in 895 to ferry an army of <a href="Magyars">Magyars</a> across the Danube to <a href="Bulgarian-Hungarian%20Wars%23Hungarian%20conquest%20%28War%20of%20894%E2%80%93896%29">raid Bulgaria</a>. The Bulgarian war produced several costly defeats, while at the same time the Arab naval threat reached new heights, with successive raids devastating the shores of Byzantium's naval heartland, the Aegean Sea. In 891 or 893, the Arab fleet sacked the island of <a href="Samos">Samos</a> and took its "stratēgos" prisoner, and in 898, the eunuch admiral Raghib carried off 3,000 Byzantine sailors of the "Kibyrrhaiotai" as prisoners. These losses denuded Byzantine defences, opening the Aegean up to raids by the Syrian fleets. The first heavy blow came in 901, when the renegade <a href="Damian%20of%20Tarsus">Damian of Tarsus</a> plundered <a href="Demetrias">Demetrias</a>, while in the next year, <a href="Taormina">Taormina</a>, the Empire's last outpost in Sicily, fell to the Muslims. The greatest disaster, however, came in 904, when another renegade, <a href="Leo%20of%20Tripoli">Leo of Tripoli</a>, raided the Aegean. His fleet penetrated even into the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>, before proceeding to <a href="Sack%20of%20Thessalonica%20%28904%29">sack</a> the Empire's second city, <a href="Thessaloniki">Thessalonica</a>, all while the Empire's fleet remained passive in the face of the Arabs' superior numbers. Furthermore, the Cretan corsairs' raids reached such intensity, that by the end of Leo's reign, most of the southern Aegean islands were either abandoned or forced to accept Muslim control and pay tribute to the pirates. It is no surprise that a defensive and cautious mindset is prevalent in the Leo's contemporary instructions on naval warfare ("Naumachica").

The most distinguished Byzantine admiral of the period was <a href="Himerios%20%28admiral%29">Himerios</a>, the "<a href="Logothetes%20tou%20dromou">logothetēs tou dromou</a>". Appointed admiral in 904, he was unable to prevent the sack of Thessalonica, but he scored a first victory in 905 or 906, and in 910, he led a successful attack on <a href="Laodicea%20in%20Syria">Laodicea in Syria</a>. The city was sacked and its hinterland plundered and ravaged without the loss of any ships. A year later, however, a huge expedition of 112 dromons and 75 "pamphyloi" with 43,000 men, that had sailed under Himerios against the <a href="Emirate%20of%20Crete">Emirate of Crete</a>, not only failed to recover the island, but on its return voyage, it was ambushed and comprehensively defeated by Leo of Tripoli off Chios (October 912).

The tide began to turn again after 920. Coincidentally, the same year witnessed the ascension of an admiral, <a href="Romanos%20I">Romanos Lekapenos</a> (920–944), to the imperial throne, for the second (after <a href="Tiberios%20III">Tiberios Apsimaros</a>) and last time in the Empire's history. Finally, in 923, the decisive defeat of Leo of Tripoli off <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a>, coupled with the death of Damian during a siege of a Byzantine fortress in the next year, marked the beginning of the Byzantine resurgence.

The Empire's growing might was displayed in 942, when Emperor Romanos I dispatched a squadron to the <a href="Tyrrhenian%20Sea">Tyrrhenian Sea</a>. Using Greek fire, the squadron destroyed a fleet of Muslim corsairs from <a href="Fraxinetum">Fraxinetum</a>. In 949, however, another expedition of about 100 ships, launched by <a href="Constantine%20VII">Constantine VII</a> (945–959) against the Emirate of Crete, ended in disaster, due to the incompetence of its commander, <a href="Constantine%20Gongyles">Constantine Gongyles</a>. A renewed offensive in Italy in 951–952 was defeated by the <a href="Fatimids">Fatimids</a>, but another expedition in 956 and the loss of an Ifriqiyan fleet in a storm in 958 temporarily stabilized the situation in the peninsula. In 962, the Fatimids launched an assault on the remaining Byzantine strongholds on Sicily; Taormina fell on Christmas Day 962 and <a href="Rometta">Rometta</a> was besieged. In response, a major Byzantine expedition was launched in 964 but ended in disaster. The Fatimids defeated the Byzantine army before Rametta and then annihilated the fleet at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Straits">Battle of the Straits</a>, notably through the use of divers bearing incendiary devices. Both powers focusing their attention elsewhere, a truce was concluded between Byzantium and the Fatimids in 967, which curbed Byzantine naval activity in the West: the seas of Italy were left to the local Byzantine forces and the various Italian states until after 1025, when Byzantium again actively intervened in southern Italy and Sicily.

In the East, in 956 the "stratēgos" <a href="Basil%20Hexamilites">Basil Hexamilites</a> inflicted a crushing defeat on the Tarsos fleet, opening the way for another grand expedition to recover Crete. It was entrusted to <a href="Nikephoros%20II">Nikephoros Phokas</a>, who in 960 set out with a fleet of 100 dromons, 200 "chelandia", and 308 transports, carrying an overall force of 77,000 men, to subdue the island. The conquest of Crete removed the direct threat to the Aegean, Byzantium's naval heartland, while Phokas' subsequent operations led to the recovery of Cilicia (in 963), Cyprus (in 968), and the northern Syrian coast (in 969). These conquests removed the threat of the once mighty Muslim Syrian fleets, effectively re-establishing Byzantine dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean, so that Nikephoros Phokas could boast to <a href="Liutprand%20of%20Cremona">Liutprand of Cremona</a> with the words "I alone command the sea". A few raids and naval clashes occurred as antagonism with the Fatimids mounted in the late 990s, but peaceful relations were restored soon after, and the Eastern Mediterranean remained relatively calm for several decades to come.

During the same period, the Byzantine fleet was active in the Black Sea as well: a Rus' fleet that was <a href="Rus%27%E2%80%93Byzantine%20War%20%28941%29">threatening Constantinople</a> in 941 was destroyed by 15 hastily assembled old ships equipped with Greek fire, and the navy played an important role in the <a href="Rus%27%E2%80%93Byzantine%20War%20%28970%E2%80%93971%29">Rus'–Byzantine War of 970–971</a>, when <a href="John%20I%20Tzimiskes">John I Tzimiskes</a> (969–976) sent 300 ships to blockade the <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a> from retreating over the Danube.

Throughout most of the 11th century, the Byzantine navy faced few challenges. The Muslim threat had receded, as their navies declined and relations between the Fatimids, especially, and the Empire were largely peaceful. The last Arab raid against imperial territory was recorded in 1035 in the <a href="Cyclades">Cyclades</a>, and was defeated in the next year. Another <a href="Rus%27%E2%80%93Byzantine%20War%20%281043%29">Rus' attack</a> in 1043 was beaten back with ease, and with the exception of a short-lived attempt to recover Sicily under <a href="George%20Maniakes">George Maniakes</a>, no major naval expeditions were undertaken either. Inevitably, this long period of peace and prosperity led to complacency and neglect of the military. Already in the reign of <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> (976–1025), the defence of the Adriatic was entrusted to the Venetians. Under <a href="Constantine%20IX">Constantine IX</a> (1042–1055), both the army and navy were reduced as military service was increasingly commuted in favour of cash payments, resulting in an increased dependency upon foreign mercenaries. The large thematic fleets declined and were replaced by small squadrons subject to the local military commanders, geared more towards the suppression of piracy than towards confronting a major maritime foe.

By the last quarter of the 11th century, the Byzantine navy was a shadow of its former self, having declined through neglect, the incompetence of its officers, and lack of funds. <a href="Kekaumenos">Kekaumenos</a>, writing in c. 1078, laments that "on the pretext of reasonable patrols, [the Byzantine ships] are doing nothing else but ferrying wheat, barley, pulse, cheese, wine, meat, olive oil, a great deal of money, and anything else" from the islands and coasts of the Aegean, while they "flee [the enemy] before they have even caught sight of them, and thus become an embarrassment to the Romans". By the time Kekaumenos wrote, new and powerful adversaries had risen. In the West, the <a href="Normans">Norman</a> <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sicily">Kingdom of Sicily</a>, which had expelled the Byzantines from Southern Italy and had conquered Sicily, was now casting its eye on the Byzantine Adriatic coasts and beyond. In the East, the disastrous <a href="Battle%20of%20Manzikert">Battle of Manzikert</a> in 1071 had resulted in the loss of Asia Minor, the Empire's military and economic heartland, to the <a href="Seljuk%20Turks">Seljuk Turks</a>, who by 1081 had established their capital at <a href="%C4%B0znik">Nicaea</a>, barely a hundred miles south of Constantinople. Soon after, Turkish as well as Christian pirates appeared in the Aegean. The Byzantine thematic fleets, which once policed the seas, were by then so depleted by neglect and the successive civil wars that they were incapable of responding effectively.

At this point, the sorry state of the Byzantine fleet had dire consequences. The Norman invasion could not be forestalled, and their army seized Corfu, landed unopposed in Epirus and <a href="Battle%20of%20Dyrrhachium%20%281081%29">laid siege</a> to <a href="Dyrrhachium">Dyrrhachium</a>, starting a decade of war which consumed the scant resources of the embattled Empire. The new emperor, <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a> (1081–1118), was forced to call upon the assistance of the Venetians, who in the 1070s had already asserted their control of the Adriatic and Dalmatia against the Normans. In 1082, in exchange for their help, he granted them major trading concessions. This treaty, and subsequent extensions of these privileges, practically rendered the Byzantines hostage to the Venetians (and later also the Genoese and the Pisans). Historian John Birkenmeier notes that:

In the clashes with the Normans through the 1080s, the only effective Byzantine naval force was a squadron commanded, and possibly maintained, by <a href="Michael%20Maurex">Michael Maurex</a>, a veteran naval commander of previous decades. Together with the Venetians, he initially prevailed over the Norman fleet, but the joint fleet was caught off guard and defeated by the Normans off Corfu in 1084.

Alexios inevitably realized the importance of having his own fleet, and despite his preoccupation with land operations, he took steps to re-establish the navy's strength. His efforts bore some success, especially in countering the attempts by Turkish emirs like <a href="Chaka%20of%20Smyrna">Tzachas</a> of Smyrna to <a href="Seljuk%20Campaigns%20in%20the%20Aegean">launch fleets</a> in the Aegean. The fleet under <a href="John%20Doukas%20%28megas%20doux%29">John Doukas</a> was subsequently used to suppress revolts in Crete and Cyprus. With the aid of the <a href="First%20Crusade">Crusaders</a>, Alexios was able to regain the coasts of Western Anatolia and expand his influence eastwards: in 1104, a Byzantine squadron of 10 ships captured Laodicea and other coastal towns as far as <a href="Tripoli%2C%20Lebanon">Tripoli</a>. By 1118, Alexios was able to pass on a small navy to his successor, <a href="John%20II%20Komnenos">John II Komnenos</a> (1118–1143). Like his father, John II concentrated on the army and regular land-based campaigns, but he took care to maintain the navy's strength and provisioning system. In 1122, however, John refused to renew the trading privileges that Alexios had granted to the Venetians. In retaliation, the Venetians plundered several Byzantine islands, and, with the Byzantine fleet unable to confront them, John was forced to renew the treaty in 1125. Evidently the Byzantine navy at this point was not sufficiently powerful for John to successfully confront Venice, especially since there were other pressing demands on the Empire's resources. Not long after this incident, John II, acting on the advice of his finance minister <a href="John%20of%20Poutza">John of Poutza</a>, is reported to have cut funding to the fleet and transferred it to the army, equipping ships on an "ad hoc" basis only.

The navy enjoyed a major comeback under the ambitious emperor <a href="Manuel%20I%20Komnenos">Manuel I Komnenos</a> (1143–1180), who used it extensively as a powerful tool of foreign policy in his relations with the Latin and Muslim states of the Eastern Mediterranean. During the early years of his reign, the Byzantine naval forces were still weak: in 1147, the fleet of <a href="Roger%20II%20of%20Sicily">Roger II of Sicily</a> under <a href="George%20of%20Antioch">George of Antioch</a> was able to raid Corfu, the <a href="Ionian%20islands">Ionian islands</a> and into the Aegean almost unopposed. In the next year, with Venetian aid, an army accompanied by a very large fleet (allegedly 500 warships and 1,000 transports) was sent to recapture Corfu and the Ionian Islands from the Normans. In retaliation, a Norman fleet of 40 ships reached Constantinople itself, demonstrating in the Bosporus off the <a href="Great%20Palace%20of%20Constantinople">Great Palace</a> and raiding its suburbs. On its return voyage however it was attacked and destroyed by a Byzantine or Venetian fleet.

In 1155, a Byzantine squadron of 10 ships in support of Norman rebel <a href="Robert%20III%20of%20Loritello">Robert III of Loritello</a> arrived at <a href="Ancona">Ancona</a>, launching the last Byzantine bid to regain Southern Italy. Despite initial successes and reinforcements under "<a href="megas%20doux">megas doux</a>" Alexios Komnenos Bryennios, the expedition was ultimately defeated in 1156, and 4 Byzantine ships were captured. By 1169, the efforts of Manuel had evidently borne fruit, as a large and purely Byzantine fleet of about 150 <a href="galley">galley</a>s, 10-12 large transports and 60 <a href="Horse%20transports%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">horse transports</a> under "megas doux" <a href="Andronikos%20Kontostephanos">Andronikos Kontostephanos</a> was sent to <a href="Crusader%20invasions%20of%20Egypt">invade Egypt</a> in cooperation with the ruler of the <a href="Crusader%20states">Crusader</a> <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>. The invasion failed however, and the Byzantines lost half the fleet in a storm on the way back.

Following the Empire-wide seizure and imprisonment of all Venetians in March 1171, the Byzantine fleet was strong enough to <a href="Byzantine%E2%80%93Venetian%20war%20of%201171">deter an outright attack</a> by the Venetians, who sailed to <a href="Chios">Chios</a> and settled for negotiations. Manuel sent a fleet of 150 ships under Kontostephanos to confront them there and employed delaying tactics, until, weakened by disease, the Venetians began to withdraw and were pursued by Kontostephanos' fleet. It was a remarkable reversal of fortunes, compared with the humiliation of 1125. In 1177, another fleet of 70 galleys and 80 auxiliary ships under Kontostephanos, destined for Egypt, returned home after appearing off <a href="Acre%20%28city%29">Acre</a>, as Count <a href="Philip%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Philip of Flanders</a> and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem refused to participate in the campaign. However, by the end of Manuel's reign, the strains of constant warfare on all fronts and the Emperor's various grandiose projects had become evident: the historian <a href="Niketas%20Choniates">Niketas Choniates</a> attributes the rise of piracy in the latter years of Manuel's reign to the diversion of the funds intended for the maintenance of the fleet for other needs of the imperial treasury.

After the death of Manuel I and the subsequent demise of the Komnenian dynasty in 1185, the navy declined swiftly. The maintenance of galleys and the upkeep of proficient crews were very expensive, and neglect led to a rapid deterioration of the fleet. Already by 1182 the Byzantines had to pay Venetian mercenaries to crew some of their galleys, but in the 1180s, as the bulk of the Komnenian naval establishment persisted, expeditions of 70–100 ships are still recorded in contemporary sources. Thus Emperor <a href="Andronikos%20I%20Komnenos">Andronikos I Komnenos</a> (1183–1185) could still gather 100 warships in 1185 to resist and later defeat a Norman fleet in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>. However, the subsequent peace treaty included a clause which required the Normans to furnish a fleet for the Empire. This, together with a similar agreement made by <a href="Isaac%20II%20Angelos">Isaac II Angelos</a> (1185–1195 and 1203–1204) with Venice the next year, in which the Republic would provide 40–100 galleys at six months' notice in exchange for favourable trading concessions, is a telling indication that the Byzantine government was aware of the inadequacy of its own naval establishment.

The period also saw the rise of piracy across the Eastern Mediterranean. Pirate activity was high in the Aegean, while pirate captains frequently offering themselves as mercenaries to one or the other of the region's powers, providing for the latter a quick and cheap way of raising a fleet for particular expeditions, without the costs of a standing navy. Thus a Byzantine fleet of 66 vessels sent by Isaac II to recapture Cyprus from <a href="Isaac%20Komnenos%20of%20Cyprus">Isaac Komnenos</a> was destroyed by the pirate <a href="Margaritus%20of%20Brindisi">Margaritus of Brindisi</a>, who was in the employ of the Normans of Sicily. The depredations of the pirates, especially the <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoese</a> captain Kaphoures, described by Niketas Choniates and his brother, the <a href="Metropolitan%20of%20Athens">Metropolitan of Athens</a> <a href="Michael%20Choniates">Michael Choniates</a>, finally forced the Angeloi to action. The fleet tax was once again levied from the coastal regions and a navy of 30 ships was equipped, which was entrusted to the Calabrian pirate <a href="Steiriones">Steiriones</a>. Despite scoring a few early successes, Steiriones' fleet was destroyed in a surprise attack by Kaphoures off <a href="Sestos">Sestos</a>. A second fleet, augmented by Pisan vessels and again commanded by Steiriones, was finally able to defeat Kaphoures and end his raids.
At the same time, however, the then "megas doux", <a href="Michael%20Stryphnos">Michael Stryphnos</a>, was accused by Niketas Choniates of enriching himself by selling off the equipment of the imperial fleet, while by the early 13th century the authority of the central government had weakened to such an extent that various local potentates began seizing power in the provinces. The general atmosphere was one of lawlessness, which enabled men like <a href="Leo%20Sgouros">Leo Sgouros</a> in southern Greece and the imperial governor of Samos, Pegonites, to use their ships for their own purposes, launching raids of their own. Even Emperor <a href="Alexios%20III%20Angelos">Alexios III Angelos</a> (1195–1203) is said to have licensed one of his commanders, Constantine Phrangopoulos, to launch pirate raids against commerce in the Black Sea.

The Byzantine state and its fleet were thus in no state to resist the naval might of Venice, which supported the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a>. When Alexios III and Stryphnos were alerted to the fact that the Crusade was sailing for Constantinople, only 20 "wretched and decayed" vessels could be found, according to Niketas Choniates. During the <a href="Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%281203%29">first Crusader siege</a> of the city in 1203, the attempts of the Byzantine ships to oppose the Crusader fleet from entering the <a href="Golden%20Horn">Golden Horn</a> were repulsed, and the Byzantine attempt to employ <a href="fireships">fireships</a> failed due to the Venetians' skill at handling their ships.

After the <a href="Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%281204%29">capture</a> of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the Byzantine Empire was <a href="Frangokratia">partitioned</a> between the Crusaders, while three Greek successor states were set up, the <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Despotate of Epirus</a>, the <a href="Empire%20of%20Trebizond">Empire of Trebizond</a>, and the <a href="Empire%20of%20Nicaea">Empire of Nicaea</a>, each claiming the Byzantine imperial title. The former did not maintain a fleet, the Trapezuntine navy was minuscule and mostly used for patrols and transporting troops, while the Nicaeans initially followed a policy of consolidation and used their fleet for coastal defence. Under <a href="John%20III%20Vatatzes">John III Vatatzes</a> (1222–1254), a more energetic foreign policy was pursued, and in 1225, the Nicaean fleet was able to occupy the islands of <a href="Lesbos">Lesbos</a>, Chios, <a href="Samos">Samos</a>, and <a href="Icaria">Icaria</a>. It was, however, no match for the Venetians: attempting to <a href="Siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%281235%29">blockade Constantinople</a> in 1235, the Nicaean navy was defeated by a far smaller Venetian force, and in another similar attempt in 1241, the Nicaeans were again routed. Nicaean efforts during the 1230s to support a local rebellion in Crete against Venice were also only partially successful, with the last Nicaean troops being forced to leave the island in 1236. Aware of the weakness of his navy, in March 1261 the Emperor <a href="Michael%20VIII%20Palaiologos">Michael VIII Palaiologos</a> (1259–1282) concluded the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Nymphaeum%20%281261%29">Treaty of Nymphaeum</a> with the Genoese, securing their aid against Venice at sea, in return for commercial privileges.
Following the recapture of Constantinople a few months later however, Michael VIII was able to focus his attention on building up his own fleet. In the early 1260s, the Byzantine navy was still weak, and depended still greatly on Genoese aid. Even so, the allies were not able to stand up to Venice in a direct confrontation, as evidenced by the <a href="Battle%20of%20Settepozzi">defeat</a> of a combined Byzantine–Genoese fleet of 48 ships by a much smaller Venetian fleet in 1263. Taking advantage of the Italians' preoccupation with the ongoing <a href="War%20of%20Saint%20Sabas">Venetian–Genoese war</a>, by 1270 Michael's efforts had produced a strong navy of 80 ships, with several Latin privateers sailing under imperial colours. In the same year, a fleet of 24 galleys besieged the town of <a href="Oreoi">Oreos</a> in Negroponte (<a href="Euboea">Euboea</a>), and defeated a Latin fleet of 20 galleys. This marked the first successful independent Byzantine naval operation and the beginning of an organized naval campaign in the Aegean that would continue throughout the 1270s and would result in the recapture, albeit briefly, of many islands from the Latins.

This revival did not last long. Following the death of <a href="Charles%20of%20Anjou">Charles of Anjou</a> in 1285 and the end of the threat of an invasion from Italy, Michael's successor <a href="Andronikos%20II%20Palaiologos">Andronikos II Palaiologos</a> (1282–1328) assumed that, by relying on the naval strength of his Genoese allies, he could do without the maintenance of a fleet, whose particularly heavy expenditure the increasingly cash-strapped treasury could no longer afford. At the same time, Andronikos was less concerned with the West and more with affairs in Asia Minor and his—eventually futile—attempt to stop the Turkish advance there, a policy where the fleet lacked a role. Consequently, the entire fleet was disbanded, its crews dismissed and the ships broken up or left to rot. The results were quick to follow: during Andronikos' long reign, the Turks gradually took permanent possession of the Aegean coasts of Anatolia, with the Empire unable to reverse the situation, while the Venetian fleet was able to attack Constantinople and raid its suburbs at will during the <a href="Byzantine%E2%80%93Venetian%20War%20%281296%E2%80%931302%29">1296–1302 war</a>.

Andronikos' decision aroused considerable opposition and criticism from contemporary scholars and officials almost from the outset, and historians like <a href="Pachymeres">Pachymeres</a> and <a href="Nikephoros%20Gregoras">Nikephoros Gregoras</a> dwell long on the disastrous long-term effects of this short-sighted decision: piracy flourished, often augmented by the crews of the disbanded fleet who took service under Turkish and Latin masters, Constantinople was rendered defenceless towards the Italian maritime powers, and more and more Aegean islands fell under foreign rule—including Chios to the Genoese <a href="Benedetto%20Zaccaria">Benedetto Zaccaria</a>, <a href="Hospitaller%20conquest%20of%20Rhodes">Rhodes and the Dodecanese</a> to the <a href="Hospitallers">Hospitallers</a>, Lesbos and other islands to the <a href="Gattilusi">Gattilusi</a>. As Gregoras commented, "if [the Byzantines] had remained masters of the seas, as they had been, then the Latins would not have grown so arrogant [...], nor would the Turks ever have gazed upon the sands of the [Aegean] sea, [...] nor would we have to pay to everyone tribute every year." After 1305, bowing to popular pressure and the need to contain the <a href="Catalan%20Company">Catalan Company</a>, the Emperor belatedly tried to rebuild the navy of 20 vessels, but although a few ships were built and a small fleet appears to have been active over the next couple of years, it eventually was disbanded again.

In the 14th century, recurrent civil wars, attacks from Bulgaria and Serbia in the Balkans and the devastation caused by ever-increasing Turkish raids hastened the collapse of the Byzantine state, which would culminate in its final fall to the <a href="Ottoman%20Turks">Ottoman Turks</a> in 1453. Several emperors after Andronikos II also tried to re-build a fleet, especially in order to secure the security and hence the independence of Constantinople itself from the interference of the Italian maritime powers, but their efforts produced only short-term results.

Thus Andronikos II's successor <a href="Andronikos%20III%20Palaiologos">Andronikos III Palaiologos</a> (1328–1341), immediately after his accession, with the help of contributions from various magnates, assembled a large fleet of reportedly 105 vessels. This he personally led in the last major foray of a Byzantine navy in the Aegean, recovering Chios and <a href="Phocaea">Phocaea</a> from the Genoese and forcing various smaller Latin and Turkish principalities to come to terms with him. His campaigns against the Ottomans in <a href="Bithynia">Bithynia</a> were failures, however, and soon the Ottomans had established their first naval base at <a href="Trigleia">Trigleia</a> on the Sea of Marmara, from where they raided the coasts of Thrace. To defend against this new threat, towards the end of Andronikos III's reign a fleet of some 70 ships was built at Constantinople to oppose the Turkish raids, and headed by the "megas doux" <a href="Alexios%20Apokaukos">Alexios Apokaukos</a>. This fleet was very active during the <a href="Byzantine%20civil%20war%20of%201341%E2%80%931347">civil war of 1341–1347</a>, in which its commander played a prominent role. Following the civil war, Emperor <a href="John%20VI%20Kantakouzenos">John VI Kantakouzenos</a> (1347–1354) tried to restore the navy and merchant fleet, as a means of both reducing the Empire's economic dependency on the Genoese colony of <a href="Galata">Galata</a>, which controlled the trade passing through Constantinople, and of securing the control of the Dardanelles against passage by the Turks. To that end, he enlisted the aid of the Venetians, but in March 1349, his newly built fleet of nine warships and about 100 smaller vessels was caught in a storm off the southern shore of Constantinople. The inexperienced crews panicked, and the ships were either <a href="Byzantine%E2%80%93Genoese%20War%20%281348%E2%80%9349%29">sunk or captured</a> by the Genoese. Undeterred, Kantakouzenos launched another effort at building a fleet, which allowed him to re-establish Byzantine authority over Thessalonica and some coastal cities and islands. A core of this fleet was maintained at Constantinople, and although Byzantine ships remained active in the Aegean, and scored some successes over Turkish pirates, they were never able to stop their activities, let alone challenge the Italian navies for supremacy at sea. Lack of funds condemned the fleet to a mere handful of vessels maintained at Constantinople. It is characteristic that in his 1418 pamphlet to the "<a href="Despot%20%28court%20title%29">despotēs</a>" <a href="Theodore%20II%20Palaiologos">Theodore II Palaiologos</a>, the scholar <a href="Gemistos%20Plethon">Gemistos Plethon</a> advises against the maintenance of a navy, on the grounds that resources were insufficient to adequately maintain both it and an effective army.

Henceforth, the impoverished Byzantine state became a pawn of the great powers of the day, trying to survive by exploiting their rivalries. Thus, for instance, in 1351, Kantakouzenos was induced to side with Venice in its <a href="Venetian%E2%80%93Genoese%20Wars%23War%20of%201350%E2%80%931355">war with Genoa</a>, but, abandoned by the Venetian admirals, his fleet was easily defeated by the Genoese and he was forced to sign an unfavourable peace. During the brief usurpation of <a href="John%20VII%20Palaiologos">John VII</a> in 1390, <a href="Manuel%20II%20Palaiologos">Manuel II</a> (1391–1425) was able to gather only five galleys and four smaller vessels (including some from the Hospitallers of Rhodes) to recapture Constantinople and rescue his father <a href="John%20V%20Palaiologos">John V</a>. Six years later, Manuel promised to arm ten ships to assist the <a href="Crusade%20of%20Nicopolis">Crusade of Nicopolis</a>; twenty years later, he personally commanded 4 galleys and 2 other vessels carrying some infantry and cavalry, and saved the island of <a href="Thasos">Thasos</a> from an invasion. Byzantine ships were active throughout the <a href="Ottoman%20Interregnum">Ottoman Interregnum</a>, when Byzantium sided with various rival Ottoman princes in turn. Manuel used his ships to ferry the rival pretenders and their forces across the Straits. With Genoese assistance, Manuel's fleet was also able to muster a fleet of eight galleys and capture Gallipoli in May 1410, albeit for a brief time; and in August 1411, the Byzantine fleet was instrumental in the failure of a siege of Constantinople by the Ottoman prince <a href="Musa%20%C3%87elebi">Musa Çelebi</a>, when it defeated Musa's attempt to blockade the city by sea as well. Likewise, in 1421, 10 Byzantine warships were engaged in support of the Ottoman pretender Mustafa against Sultan <a href="Murad%20II">Murad II</a>.

The last recorded Byzantine naval victory occurred in 1427 in a <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Echinades%20%281427%29">battle</a> off the <a href="Echinades">Echinades</a> Islands, when the Emperor <a href="John%20VIII%20Palaiologos">John VIII Palaiologos</a> (1425–1448) defeated the superior fleet of <a href="Carlo%20I%20Tocco">Carlo I Tocco</a>, <a href="County%20palatine%20of%20Cephalonia%20and%20Zakynthos">Count of Cephalonia</a> and <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Despot of Epirus</a>, forcing him to relinquish all his holdings in the Morea to the Byzantines. The last appearance of the Byzantine navy was in the final Ottoman siege of 1453, when a mixed fleet of Byzantine, Genoese and Venetian ships (varying numbers are provided by the sources, ranging from 10 to 39 vessels) defended Constantinople against the Ottoman fleet. During the siege, on 20 April 1453, the last naval engagement in Byzantine history took place, when three Genoese galleys escorting a Byzantine transport fought their way through the huge Ottoman blockade fleet and into the Golden Horn.

Very little is known about the organization of the Roman fleets of late Antiquity, from the gradual break-up of the large provincial fleets into smaller squadrons in the 3rd century to the formation of a new navy at the onset of the Muslim conquests. Despite the evidence of considerable naval activity in this period, earlier scholars believed that the Roman navy had all but vanished by the 4th century, but more recent work has altered this picture towards a transformation into a mainly fluvial and coastal force, designed for close co-operation with the army.

Under Emperor <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> (284–305), the navy's strength reportedly increased from 46,000 men to 64,000 men, a figure that represents the numerical peak of the late Roman navy. The <a href="Danube">Danube</a> Fleet ("Classis Histrica") with its attendant legionary flotillas is still well attested in the "<a href="Notitia%20Dignitatum">Notitia Dignitatum</a>", and its increased activity is commented upon by <a href="Vegetius">Vegetius</a> ("<a href="De%20Re%20Militari">De Re Militari</a>", IV.46). In the West, several fluvial fleets are mentioned, but the old standing praetorian fleets had all but vanished ("De Re Militari", IV.31) and even the remaining western provincial fleets appear to have been seriously understrength and incapable of countering any significant barbarian attack. In the East, the Syrian and Alexandrian fleets are known from legal sources to have still existed in c. 400 ("<a href="Codex%20Justinianus">Codex Justinianus</a>", <a href="http%3A//webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Corpus/CJ11.htm%232">XI.2.4</a> & <a href="http%3A//webu2.upmf-grenoble.fr/Haiti/Cours/Ak/Corpus/CJ11.htm%2313">XI.13.1</a>), while a fleet is known to have been stationed at Constantinople itself, perhaps created out of the remnants of the praetorian fleets. In 400 it was sufficient to slaughter a large number of <a href="Goth">Goth</a>s who had built rafts and tried to cross the strip of sea that separates Asia from Europe. Its size, however, is unknown, and it does not appear in the "Notitia".

For operations in the Mediterranean during the 5th century, fleets appear to have been assembled on an "ad hoc" basis and then disbanded. The first permanent Byzantine fleet can be traced to the early 6th century and the revolt of Vitalian in 513–515, when Anastasius I created a fleet to counter the rebels' own. This fleet was retained, and under Justinian I and his successors it was developed into a professional and well-maintained force. Because of the absence of any naval threat, however, the navy of the late 6th century was relatively small, with several small flotillas in the Danube and two main fleets maintained at Ravenna and Constantinople. Additional flotillas must have been stationed at the other great maritime and commercial centres of the Empire: at Alexandria, providing the escort to the annual grain fleet to Constantinople, and at Carthage, controlling the western Mediterranean. Justinian also stationed troops and ships at the more remote outposts of the Empire, at Septem (<a href="Ceuta">Ceuta</a>), <a href="Chersonesus%20Taurica">Cherson</a> in the <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a>, and Aelana (<a href="Eilat">Eilat</a>) in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aqaba">Gulf of Aqaba</a>. The long-established naval tradition and infrastructure of those areas made the maintenance of the fleet easier, and, in the event of a naval expedition, a large fleet could be quickly and inexpensively assembled by impressing the numerous merchant vessels.

In response to the Arab conquests during the 7th century, the whole administrative and military system of the Empire was reformed, and the <a href="Theme%20system">thematic system</a> established. According to this, the Empire was divided into several "themata", which were regional civil and military administrations. Under the command of a "<a href="strategos">stratēgos</a>", each "thema" maintained its own, locally levied forces. Following a series of revolts by thematic forces, under Constantine V the larger early themes were progressively broken up, while a central imperial army, the "<a href="tagma%20%28military%29">tagmata</a>", was created, stationed at or near Constantinople, serving as a central reserve that henceforth formed the core of campaigning armies.

A similar process was followed in the fleet, which was organized along similar lines. In the second half of the 7th century, the fleet of the "<a href="Karabisianoi">Karabisianoi</a>" (, "the Ships' Men") was created. The exact date is unknown, with suggestions ranging from the 650s/660s, in response to the Battle of the Masts, or following the first Arab siege of Constantinople in 672–678. Its origin is also unknown: it was recruited possibly from the remainders of the old "<a href="quaestura%20exercitus">quaestura exercitus</a>", or the army of the <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20Illyricum">Illyricum</a>. It was headed by a "stratēgos" ("stratēgos tōn karabōn/karabisianōn", "general of the ships/seafarers"), and included the southern coast of Asia Minor from <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a> to the frontier with the <a href="Caliphate">Caliphate</a> near <a href="Silifke">Seleucia</a> in Cilicia, the Aegean islands and the imperial holdings in southern Greece. Its headquarters was initially perhaps at Samos, with a subordinate command under a "droungarios" at Cibyrrha in <a href="Pamphylia">Pamphylia</a>. As its name suggests, it comprised most of the Empire's standing navy, and faced the principal maritime threat, the Arab fleets of Egypt and Syria.

The "Karabisianoi" however proved inadequate and were replaced in the early 8th century by a more complex system composed of three elements, which with minor alterations survived until the 11th century: a central imperial fleet based at Constantinople, a small number of large regional naval commands, either maritime "themata" or independent commands termed "drungariates", and a greater number of local squadrons charged with purely defensive and police tasks and subordinate to the local provincial governors. Unlike the earlier Roman navy, where the provincial fleets were decidedly inferior in numbers and included only lighter vessels than the central fleets, the Byzantine regional fleets were probably formidable formations in their own right.

The capital's navy had played a central role in the repulsion of the Arab sieges of Constantinople, but the exact date of the establishment of the Imperial Fleet (βασιλικὸς στόλος, "basilikos stolos", or βασιλικὸν πλόϊμον, "basilikon ploïmon") as a distinct command is unclear. The Irish historian <a href="J.%20B.%20Bury">J. B. Bury</a>, followed by the French Byzantinist <a href="Rodolphe%20Guilland">Rodolphe Guilland</a>, considered it "not improbable" that the Imperial Fleet existed as a subordinate command under the "stratēgos tōn karabisianōn" already in the 7th century. Certainly the <a href="Droungarios%20of%20the%20Fleet">"droungarios" of the Imperial Fleet</a> first appears in the "<a href="Taktikon%20Uspensky">Taktikon Uspensky</a>" of c. 842/3; and as there is little evidence for major fleets operating from Constantinople during the 8th century, the Greek Byzantinist <a href="H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne%20Ahrweiler">Hélène Ahrweiler</a> dated the fleet's creation to the early 9th century. From that point on, the Imperial Fleet formed the main naval reserve force and provided the core of various expeditionary fleets.
The first and for a long time only maritime theme (θέμα ναυτικόν, "thema nautikon") was the <a href="Cibyrrhaeot%20Theme">Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots</a> (, "thema Kibyrrhaiotōn"). It was created from the "Karabisianoi" fleet, and assigned to the administration and defence of the southern coasts of Asia Minor. The exact date of its creation is unclear, with one view proposing c. 719 and another c. 727. Its "stratēgos", first mentioned in 734, was based at <a href="Antalya">Attaleia</a>. His principal lieutenants were the "<a href="katepano">katepanō</a>" of the Mardaites, an "ek prosōpou" (representative) at <a href="Syllaeum">Syllaeum</a> and "droungarioi" of Attaleia and <a href="Kos">Kos</a>. Being located closest to the Muslim Levant, it remained the Empire's principal naval fleet for centuries, until it was reduced with the decline of the Arab naval threat. The fleet is last mentioned in 1043, and thereafter the theme became a purely civilian province.

The Cibyrrhaeots were complemented by two independent naval commands in the Aegean, each headed by a "droungarios": the "Aigaion Pelagos" ("Aegean Sea"), covering the northern half of the Aegean and the Dardanelles and <a href="Marmara%20Sea">Marmara Sea</a>, and the command variously known as the "Dodekanesos" ("Twelve Islands") and "Kolpos" ("Gulf"), which was based at Samos and comprised the southern Aegean including the Cyclades. Unlike the other "droungarioi" who headed subordinate commands, these two circumscriptions were completely independent, and their "droungarioi" exercised both civil and military authority over them. Eventually they were raised to full maritime themes, the <a href="Aegean%20Sea%20%28theme%29">Theme of the Aegean Sea</a> (, "thema tou Aigaiou Pelagous") c. 843, while the eastern parts of the "Dodekanesos"/"Kolpos" drungariate formed the <a href="Samos%20%28theme%29">Theme of Samos</a> (θέμα Σάμου, "thema Samou") in the late 9th century. It comprised it the <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a>n coast, and its capital was at <a href="Smyrna">Smyrna</a>.

Some "land" "themata" also maintained sizeable squadrons, usually placed under a "<a href="tourmarches">tourmarchēs</a>" (mentioned collectively as "tourmarchai tōn ploimatōn" in the "Taktikon Uspensky"). They played an intermediate role between the large thematic fleets and the central Imperial Fleet: they were permanent squadrons with professional crews ("taxatoi"), maintained by resources from the imperial treasury and not the province they were stationed in, but subordinate to the local thematic "stratēgos" and charged mainly with local defence and police duties. These were:

Isolated regions of particular importance for the control of the major sea-lanes were covered by separate officials with the title of "<a href="archon">archon</a>", who in some cases may have commanded detachments of the Imperial Fleet. Such "archontes" are known for Chios, Malta, the <a href="Euboic%20Gulf">Euboic Gulf</a>, and possibly <a href="Vagenetia">Vagenetia</a> and "Bulgaria" (whose area of control is identified by Ahrweiler with the mouths of the Danube). These vanished by the end of the 9th century, either succumbing to Arab attacks or being reformed or incorporated into themes.

Just as with its land counterpart, the exact size of the Byzantine navy and its units is a matter of considerable debate, owing to the scantness and ambiguous nature of the primary sources. One exception are the numbers for the late 9th and early 10th century, for which we possess a more detailed breakdown, dated to the Cretan expedition of 911. These lists reveal that during the reign of Leo VI the Wise, the navy reached 34,200 oarsmen and perhaps as many as 8,000 marines. The central Imperial Fleet totalled some 19,600 oarsmen and 4,000 marines under the command of the "droungarios" of the "basilikon plōimon". These four thousand marines were professional soldiers, first recruited as a corps by Basil I in the 870s. They were a great asset to the Imperial Fleet, for whereas previously it had depended on thematic and tagmatic soldiers for its marines, the new force provided a more reliable, better trained and immediately available force at the Emperor's disposal. The high status of these marines is illustrated by the fact that they were considered to belong to the imperial "tagmata", and were organized along similar lines. The Aegean thematic fleet numbered 2,610 oarsmen and 400 marines, the Cibyrrhaeot fleet stood at 5,710 oarsmen and 1,000 marines, the Samian fleet at 3,980 oarsmen and 600 marines, and finally, the Theme of Hellas furnished 2,300 oarsmen with a portion of its 2,000 thematic soldiers doubling as marines.

The following table contains estimates, by Warren T. Treadgold, of the number of oarsmen over the entire history of the Byzantine navy:

Contrary to popular perception, <a href="galley%20slave">galley slave</a>s were not used as oarsmen, either by the Byzantines or the Arabs, or by their Roman and Greek predecessors. Throughout the existence of the Empire, Byzantine crews consisted of mostly lower-class freeborn men, who were professional soldiers, legally obliged to perform military service ("<a href="strateia">strateia</a>") in return for pay or land estates. In the first half of the 10th century, the latter were calculated to be of the value of of gold for sailors and marines. Use was however made of prisoners of war and foreigners as well. Alongside the Mardaites, who formed a significant part of the fleet's crews, an enigmatic group known as the "Toulmatzoi" (possibly Dalmatians) appears in the Cretan expeditions, as well as many Rus', who were given the right to serve in the Byzantine armed forces in a series of 10th-century <a href="Rus%27%E2%80%93Byzantine%20Treaty%20%28disambiguation%29">treaties</a>.

In his "<a href="De%20Ceremoniis">De Ceremoniis</a>", <a href="Constantine%20Porphyrogennetos">Constantine Porphyrogennetos</a> gives the fleet lists for the expeditions against Crete of 911 and 949. These references have sparked a considerable debate as to their interpretation: thus the numbers given for the entire Imperial Fleet in 949 can be interpreted as either 100, 150 or 250 ships, depending on the reading of the Greek text. The precise meaning of the term "ousia" () is also a subject of confusion: traditionally, it is held to have been a standard complement of 108 men, and that more than one could be present aboard a single ship. In the context of the "De Ceremoniis" however, it can also be read simply as "unit" or "ship". The number of 150 seems more compatible with the numbers recorded elsewhere, and is accepted by most scholars, although they differ as to the composition of the fleet. Makrypoulias interprets the number as 8 "pamphyloi", 100 "ousiakoi" and 42 "dromōnes" proper, the latter including the two imperial vessels and the ten ships of the "Stenon" squadron. As for the total size of the Byzantine navy in this period, Warren Treadgold extrapolates a total, including the naval themes, of c. 240 warships, a number which was increased to 307 for the Cretan expedition of 960–961. According to Treadgold, the latter number probably represents the approximate standing strength of the entire Byzantine navy (including the smaller flotillas) in the 9th and 10th centuries. It is however noteworthy that a significant drop in the numbers of ships and men attached to the thematic fleets is evident between 911 and 949. This drop, which reduced the size of thematic fleets from a third to a quarter of the total navy, was partly due to the increased use of the lighter "ousiakos" type instead of the heavier "dromōn", and partly due to financial and manpower difficulties. It is also indicative of a general trend that would lead to the complete disappearance of the provincial fleets by the late 11th century.

Although naval themes were organized much the same way as their land counterparts, there is some confusion in the Byzantine sources as to the exact rank structure. The usual term for admiral was "stratēgos", the same term used for the generals that governed the land "themata". Under the "stratēgos" were two or three "tourmarchai" (sing. "tourmarches", effectively "Vice Admiral"), in turn overseeing a number of "droungarioi" (sing. "droungarios", corresponding to "Rear Admiral"). Until the mid-9th century, the governors of the themes of the Aegean and Samos are also recorded as "droungarioi", since their commands were split off from the original "Karabisianoi" fleet, but they were then raised to the rank of "stratēgos". As the thematic admirals also doubled as governors of their themes, they were assisted by a "prōtonotarios" ("chief secretary/notary") who headed the civilian administration of the theme. Further staff officers were the "chartoularios" in charge of the fleet administration, the "<a href="protomandator">prōtomandatōr</a>" ("chief messenger"), who acted as chief of staff, and a number of staff "komētes" ("counts", sing. "komēs"), including a "komēs tēs hetaireias", who commanded the bodyguard ("<a href="hetaireia">hetaireia</a>") of the admiral.
The Imperial Fleet was a different case, as it was not tied to the thematic administration, but was considered as one of the "tagmata", the professional central reserve forces. Consequently, the commander of the Imperial Fleet remained known as the "droungarios tou basilikou ploïmou" (later with the prefix "megas", "grand"). Originally very lowly ranked, the office rose quickly in the hierarchy: by 899 he was placed immediately before or after the "<a href="logothetes%20tou%20dromou">logothetēs tou dromou</a>" and ahead of various senior military and civil officials. He was also notable in not being classed with the other military commanders, whether of the themes or of the "tagmata", but in the special class of military officials, the "<a href="stratarchai">stratarchai</a>", where he is listed second after the "<a href="hetaireiarches">hetaireiarchēs</a>", the commander of the imperial bodyguard. His title is still found in the Komnenian era, albeit as commander of the imperial escort squadron, and survived until the Palaiologan era, being listed in the 14th-century "Book of Offices" of <a href="George%20Kodinos">Pseudo-Kodinos</a>. The office of a deputy called "<a href="topoteretes">topotērētēs</a>" is also mentioned for the Imperial Fleet, but his role is unclear from the sources. He may have held a post similar to that of a <a href="Port%20Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Port Admiral</a>. Although some of these senior officers were professional seamen, having risen from the ranks, most fleet commanders were high court officials, who would have relied on their more experienced professional subordinates for nautical expertise.

In the lower levels of organization, there was more uniformity: squadrons of three or five ships were commanded by a "komēs" or "droungarokomēs", and each ship's captain was called "<a href="kentarchos">kentarchos</a>" ("centurion"), although literary sources also used more archaic terms like "<a href="navarch">nauarchos</a>" or even "<a href="trierarch">triērarchos</a>". Each ship's crew, depending on its size, was composed of one to three "ousiai". Under the captain, there was the "bandophoros" ("banner bearer"), who acted as executive officer, two "prōtokaraboi" (sing. "prōtokarabos", "head of the ship"), sometimes also referred to archaically as "kybernētes", and a bow officer, the "prōreus". The "prōtokaraboi" were helmsmen, in charge of the steering oars in the stern, as well as of the rowers on either side of the ship. The senior of the two was the "first "prōtokarabos" ("prōtos prōtokarabos"). In actual terms, there probably were several of each kind upon each ship, working in shifts. Most of these officers rose from the ranks, and there are references in the "<a href="De%20Administrando%20Imperio">De Administrando Imperio</a>" to first oarsmen ("prōtelatai") who rose to become "prōtokaraboi" in the imperial barges, and later assumed still higher offices; Emperor Romanos Lekapenos being the most successful example. There were also a number of specialists on board, such as the two bow oarsmen and the "siphōnatores", who worked the siphons used for discharging the Greek fire. A "boukinatōr" ("trumpeter") is also recorded in the sources, who conveyed orders to the rowers ("kōpēlatai" or "elatai"). Since the marine infantry were organized as regular army units, their ranks followed those of the <a href="Byzantine%20army">army</a>.

After the decline of the navy in the 11th century, Alexios I rebuilt it on different lines. Since the thematic fleets had all but vanished, their remnants were amalgamated into a unified imperial fleet, under the new office of the "megas doux". The first known occupant of the office was Alexios' brother-in-law John Doukas, in c. 1092. The "megas droungarios" of the fleet, once the overall naval commander, was subordinated to him, acting now as his principal aide. The "megas doux" was also appointed as overall governor of southern Greece, the old "themata" of Hellas and the Peloponnese, which were divided into districts ("oria") that supplied the fleet. Under John II, the Aegean islands also became responsible for the maintenance, crewing and provision of warships, and contemporary sources took pride in the fact that the great fleets of Manuel's reign were crewed by "native Romans", although use continued to be made of mercenaries and allied squadrons. However, the fact that the fleet was now exclusively built and based around Constantinople, and that provincial fleets were not reconstituted, did have its drawbacks, as outlying areas, in particular Greece, were left vulnerable to attack.

With the decline of the Byzantine fleet in the latter 12th century, the Empire increasingly relied on the fleets of Venice and Genoa. Following the sack of 1204 however, sources suggest the presence of a relatively strong fleet already under the first Nicaean emperor, <a href="Theodore%20I%20Laskaris">Theodore I Laskaris</a>, although specific details are lacking. Under John III and <a href="Theodore%20II%20Laskaris">Theodore II</a> (1254–1258), the navy had two main strategic areas of operations: the Aegean, entailing operations against the Greek islands (chiefly <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>) as well as the transport and supply of armies fighting in the Balkans, and the Sea of Marmara, where the Nicaeans aimed to interdict Latin shipping and threaten Constantinople. Smyrna provided the main shipyard and base for the Aegean, with a secondary one at <a href="Dat%C3%A7a">Stadeia</a>, while the main base for operations in the Marmara Sea was Holkos, near <a href="Lampsakos">Lampsakos</a> across the <a href="Gallipoli%20peninsula">Gallipoli peninsula</a>.

Despite their efforts, the Nicaean emperors failed to successfully challenge the Venetian domination of the seas, and were forced to turn to the Genoese for aid. After regaining Constantinople in 1261 however, Michael VIII initiated a great effort to lessen this dependence by building a "national" navy, forming a number of new corps to this purpose: the "<a href="Gasmouloi">Gasmouloi</a>" (), who were men of mixed Greek-Latin descent living around the capital; and men from <a href="Laconia">Laconia</a>, called "Lakōnes" (Λάκωνες, "Laconians") or "<a href="Tsakonians">Tzakōnes</a>" (Τζάκωνες), were used as marines, forming the bulk of Byzantine naval manpower in the 1260s and 1270s. Michael also set the rowers, called "Prosalentai" (Προσαλενταί) or "Proselōntes" (Προσελῶντες), apart as a separate corps. All these groups received small grants of land to cultivate in exchange for their service, and were settled together in small colonies. The "Prosalentai" were settled near the sea throughout the northern Aegean, while the "Gasmouloi" and "Tzakōnes" were settled mostly around Constantinople and in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>. These corps remained extant, albeit in a diminished form, throughout the last centuries of the Empire; indeed the "Gasmouloi" of Gallipoli formed the bulk of the crews of the first Ottoman fleets. Throughout the Palaiologan period, the fleet's main base was the harbour of <a href="Kontoskalion">Kontoskalion</a> on the Marmara shore of Constantinople, dredged and refortified by Michael VIII. Among the provincial naval centres, probably the most important was <a href="Monemvasia">Monemvasia</a> in the Peloponnese.

At the same time, Michael and his successors continued the well-established practice of using foreigners in the fleet. Alongside the mistrusted Italian city-states, with whom alliances shifted regularly, mercenaries were increasingly employed in the last centuries of the Empire, often rewarded for their services with <a href="fief">fief</a>s. Most of these mercenaries, like <a href="Giovanni%20de%20lo%20Cavo">Giovanni de lo Cavo</a> (lord of <a href="Anafi">Anafi</a> and Rhodes), <a href="Andrea%20Morisco">Andrea Morisco</a> (successor of de lo Cavo in Rhodes) and Benedetto Zaccaria (lord of Chios and Phocaea), were Genoese, the Byzantines' major ally in the period. Under Michael VIII, for the first time a foreigner, the Italian privateer <a href="Licario">Licario</a>, became "megas doux" and was given Euboea as a fief. In 1303, another high rank, that of "<a href="admiral">amēralēs</a>" ( or ) was introduced. The term had already entered Byzantine usage through contact with the Kingdom of Naples and other Western nations, but was rarely used; it was adopted as part of the imperial hierarchy, coming after the "megas doux" and the "megas droungarios", with the arrival of the mercenaries of the Catalan Company. Only two holders are known, <a href="Ferran%20d%27Aun%C3%A9s">Ferran d'Aunés</a> and Andrea Morisco, both from 1303–1305, although the rank continued to be mentioned in various lists of offices long after that. Thus, according to the mid-14th century "Book of Offices", the subordinates of the "megas doux" were the "megas droungarios tou stolou", the "amēralios", the "prōtokomēs", the junior "droungarioi", and the junior "komētes". Pseudo-Kodinos also records that, while the other warships flew "the usual imperial flag" (βασιλικὸν φλάμουλον, "basilikon phlamoulon") of the <a href="Tetragrammic%20cross">cross and the firesteels</a>, the "megas doux" flew an image of the emperor on horseback as his distinctive ensign.

The primary warship of the Byzantine navy until the 12th century was the <a href="dromon">dromon</a> (δρόμων) and other similar ship types. Apparently an evolution of the light <a href="Liburnian%20%28ship%29">liburnian galleys</a> of the imperial Roman fleets, the term first appears in the late 5th century, and was commonly used for a specific kind of war-galley by the 6th. The term "dromōn" itself comes from the Greek root δρομ-(άω), "to run", thus meaning "runner", and 6th-century authors like <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a> are explicit in their references to the speed of these vessels. During the next few centuries, as the naval struggle with the Arabs intensified, heavier versions with two or possibly even three banks of oars evolved. Eventually, the term was used in the general sense of "warship", and was often used interchangeably with another Byzantine term for a large warship, "<a href="chelandion">chelandion</a>" (χελάνδιον, from the Greek word "kelēs", "<a href="Courser%20%28horse%29">courser</a>"), which first appeared during the 8th century.

The appearance and evolution of medieval warships is a matter of debate and conjecture: until recently, no remains of an oared warship from either ancient or early medieval times had been found, and information had to be gathered by analyzing literary evidence, crude artistic depictions and the remains of a few merchant vessels. Only in 2005–2006 did archaeological digs for the <a href="Marmaray">Marmaray</a> project in the location of the <a href="Harbour%20of%20Eleutherios">Harbour of Theodosius</a> (modern Yenikapi) uncover the remains of over 36 Byzantine ships from the 6th to 10th centuries, including four light galleys of the "galea" type.

The accepted view is that the main developments which differentiated the early dromons from the liburnians, and that henceforth characterized Mediterranean galleys, were the adoption of a full <a href="Deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> ("katastrōma"), the abandonment of the <a href="ramming">rams</a> on the bow in favour of an above-water spur, and the gradual introduction of <a href="lateen">lateen</a> sails. The exact reasons for the abandonment of the ram (; , "embolos") are unclear. Depictions of upward-pointing beaks in the 4th-century "<a href="Vatican%20Vergil">Vatican Vergil</a>" manuscript may well illustrate that the ram had already been replaced by a spur in late Roman galleys. One possibility is that the change occurred because of the gradual evolution of the ancient <a href="Trireme%23Construction">shell-first</a> <a href="mortise%20and%20tenon">mortise and tenon</a> <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> construction method, against which rams had been designed, into the skeleton-first method, which produced a stronger and more flexible hull, less susceptible to ram attacks. Certainly by the early 7th century, the ram's original function had been forgotten, if we judge by <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>'s comments that they were used to protect against collision with underwater rocks. As for the lateen sail, various authors have in the past suggested that it was introduced into the Mediterranean by the Arabs, possibly with an ultimate origin in <a href="India">India</a>. However, the discovery of new depictions and literary references in recent decades has led scholars to antedate the appearance of the lateen sail in the Levant to the late <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> or early Roman period. Not only the triangular, but also the quadrilateral version were known, used for centuries (mostly on smaller craft) in parallel with square sails. Belisarius' invasion fleet of 533 was apparently at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that by the time the lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon, with the traditional square sail gradually falling from use in medieval navigation.

The dromons that Procopius describes were single-banked ships of probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an <a href="outrigger">outrigger</a> ("parexeiresia"), these extended directly from the hull. In the later <a href="bireme">bireme</a> dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks ("elasiai") were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the marines in boarding operations. Makrypoulias suggests 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast ("histos" or "katartion"), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to manoeuvre effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two <a href="rudder">quarter rudders</a> at the <a href="stern">stern</a> ("prymnē"), which also housed a tent ("skēnē") that covered the captain's berth ("krab(b)at(t)os"). The prow ("prōra") featured an elevated forecastle ("pseudopation"), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade ("kastellōma"), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around the sides of the ship, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles ("xylokastra") on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur ("peronion") was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.

The four "galeai" ships uncovered in the Yenikapi excavations, dating to the 10th–11th centuries, are of uniform design and construction, suggesting a centralized manufacturing process. They have a length of c. 30 m, and are built of <a href="European%20Black%20Pine">European Black Pine</a> and <a href="Oriental%20plane">Oriental plane</a>.

By the 10th century, there were three main classes of bireme (two oar-banks) warships of the general dromon type, as detailed in the inventories for the Cretan expeditions of 911 and 949: the "[chelandion] ousiakon" (), so named because it was manned by an "ousia" of 108; the "[chelandion] pamphylon" ([χελάνδιον] πάμφυλον), crewed with up to 120–160 men, its name either implying an origin in the region of Pamphylia as a transport ship or its crewing with "picked crews" (from , "all tribes"); and the "dromōn" proper, crewed by two "ousiai". In the "De Ceremoniis", the heavy "dromōn" is said to have an even larger crew of 230 rowers and 70 marines; naval historian John H. Pryor considers them as supernumerary crews being carried aboard, while the Greek scholar Christos Makrypoulias suggests that the extra men correspond to a second rower on each of the upper-bank oars. A smaller, single-bank ship, the "monērēs" (μονήρης, "single-banked") or "galea" (γαλέα, from which the term "galley" derives), with c. 60 men as crew, was used for scouting missions but also in the wings of the battle line. The "galea" in particular seems to have been strongly associated with the Mardaites, and Christos Makrypoulias even suggests that the ship was exclusively used by them. Three-banked ("trireme") dromons are described in a 9th-century work dedicated to the "<a href="parakoimomenos">parakoimōmenos</a>" <a href="Basil%20Lekapenos">Basil Lekapenos</a>. However, this treatise, which survives only in fragments, draws heavily upon references on the appearance and construction of a Classical <a href="trireme">trireme</a>, and must therefore be used with care when trying to apply it to the warships of the middle Byzantine period. The existence of trireme vessels is, however, attested in the Fatimid navy in the 11th and 12th centuries, and references made by Leo VI to large Arab ships in the 10th century may also indicate trireme galleys.

For cargo transport, the Byzantines usually commandeered ordinary merchantmen as transport ships ("phortēgoi") or supply ships ("skeuophora"). These appear to have been mostly sailing vessels, rather than oared. The Byzantines and Arabs also employed <a href="Horse%20transports%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">horse-transports</a> ("hippagōga"), which were either sailing ships or galleys, the latter certainly modified to accommodate the horses. Given that the "chelandia" appear originally to have been oared horse-transports, this would imply differences in construction between the "chelandion" and the "dromōn" proper, terms which otherwise are often used indiscriminately in literary sources. While the "dromōn" was developed exclusively as a war galley, the "chelandion" would have had to have a special compartment amidships to accommodate a row of horses, increasing its <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> and <a href="Hold%20%28ship%29">hold</a> depth. In addition, Byzantine sources refer to the "sandalos" or "sandalion" (σάνδαλος, σανδάλιον), which was a boat carried along by the bigger ships. The kind described in the "De Ceremoniis" had a single mast, four oars and a rudder.

The exact period when the dromon was superseded by "galea"-derived ships of Italian origin is uncertain. The term continued in use until the late 12th century, although Byzantine writers were indiscriminate in their use of it. Contemporary Western writers used the term to denote large ships, usually transports, and there is evidence to support the idea that this usage had also spread to the Byzantines. <a href="William%20of%20Tyre">William of Tyre</a>'s description of the Byzantine fleet in 1169, where "dromons" are classed as very large transports, and the warships with two oar banks are set apart from them, may thus indeed indicate the adoption of the new bireme galley types by the Byzantines. From the 13th century on, the term "dromon" fell into gradual disuse and was replaced by "katergon" (κάτεργον, meaning "detailed to/owing a service"), a late-11th century term which originally applied to the crews, who were drawn from populations detailed to military service. During the latter period of the Byzantine Empire, Byzantine ships were based on Western models: the term "katergon" is used indiscriminately for both Byzantine and Latin ships, and the horse-carrying "chelandion" was replaced by the Western "taride" (itself deriving from Arabic "ṭarrīda", adopted as "tareta", ταρέτα, in Greek). A similar process is seen in surviving sources from <a href="Capetian%20House%20of%20Anjou">Angevin</a> Sicily, where the term "chelandre" was replaced by the "taride", although for a time both continued to be used. No construction differences are mentioned between the two, with both terms referring to horse-carrying vessels ("usserii") capable of carrying from 20 to 40 horses.

The bireme Italian-style galleys remained the mainstay of Mediterranean fleets until the late 13th century, although again, contemporary descriptions provide little detail on their construction. From that point on, the galleys universally became trireme ships, i.e. with three men on a single bank located above deck, each rowing a different oar; the so-called "alla sensile" system. The Venetians also developed the so-called "great galley", which was an enlarged galley capable of carrying more cargo for trade.

Little is known on particular Byzantine ships during the period. The accounts of the 1437 journey by sea of the Byzantine delegation to the <a href="Council%20of%20Florence">Council of Florence</a>, by the Byzantine cleric Sylvester Syropoulos and the Greek-Venetian captain Michael of Rhodes, mention that most of the ships were Venetian or Papal, but also record that Emperor John VIII travelled on an "imperial ship". It is unclear whether that ship was Byzantine or had been hired, and its type is not mentioned. It is, however, recorded as having been faster than the Venetian great merchant galleys accompanying it, possibly indicating that it was a light war galley. Michael of Rhodes also wrote a treatise on shipbuilding, which provided construction instructions and illustrations of the main vessels, both <a href="http%3A//brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/ships_galleys.html">galleys</a> and <a href="http%3A//brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/ships_sailing.html">sailing ships</a>, used by Venice and the other maritime states of the region in the first half of the 15th century.

The Byzantines took care to codify, preserve and pass on the lessons of warfare at land and sea from past experience, through the use of <a href="Byzantine%20military%20manuals">military manuals</a>. Despite their sometimes antiquarian terminology, these texts form the basis of our knowledge on Byzantine naval affairs. The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat ("peri naumachias") in the "<a href="Tactica%20of%20Leo%20the%20Wise">Tactica</a>" of Leo the Wise and <a href="Nikephoros%20Ouranos">Nikephoros Ouranos</a> (both drawing extensively from the "Naumachiai" of <a href="Byzantine%20military%20manuals">Syrianos Magistros</a> and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the "De Administrando Imperio" of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.

When examining ancient and medieval naval operations, it is necessary to first understand the technological limitations of galley fleets. Galleys did not handle well in rough waters and could be swamped by waves, which would be catastrophic in the open sea; history is replete with instances where galley fleets were sunk by bad weather (e.g. the Roman losses during the <a href="First%20Punic%20War%23Naval%20warfare">First Punic War</a>). The sailing season was therefore usually restricted from mid-spring to September. The maintainable cruising speed of a galley, even when using sails, was limited, as were the amount of supplies it could carry. Water in particular, being essentially a galley's "fuel" supply, was of critical importance. With consumption levels estimated at 8 litres a day for every oarsman, its availability was a decisive operational factor in the often water-scarce and sun-baked coasts of the Eastern Mediterranean. Smaller dromons are estimated to have been able to carry about 4 days' worth of water. Effectively, this meant that fleets composed of galleys were confined to coastal routes, and had to make frequent landfall to replenish their supplies and rest their crews. This is well attested in Byzantine overseas endeavours, from Belisarius' campaign against the Vandals to the Cretan expeditions of the 9th and 10th centuries. It is for these reasons that Nikephoros Ouranos emphasizes the need to have available "men with accurate knowledge and experience of the sea [...], which winds cause it to swell and which blow from the land. They should know both the hidden rocks in the sea, and the places which have no depth, and the land along which one sails and the islands adjacent to it, the harbours and the distance such harbours are the one from the other. They should know both the countries and the water supplies."

Medieval Mediterranean naval warfare was therefore essentially coastal and amphibious in nature, carried out to seize coastal territory or islands, and not to exercise "<a href="sea%20control">sea control</a>" as it is understood today. Furthermore, following the abandonment of the ram, the only truly "ship-killing" weapon available prior to the advent of gunpowder and explosive shells, sea combat became, in the words of John Pryor, "more unpredictable. No longer could any power hope to have such an advantage in weaponry or the skill of crews that success could be expected." It is no surprise therefore that the Byzantine and Arab manuals emphasize cautious tactics, with the priority given to the preservation of one's own fleet, and the acquisition of accurate intelligence, often through the use of spies posing as merchants. Emphasis was placed on achieving tactical surprise and, conversely, on avoiding being caught unprepared by the enemy. Ideally, battle was to be given only when assured of superiority by virtue of numbers or tactical disposition. Importance is also laid on matching one's forces and tactics to the prospective enemy: Leo VI, for instance, contrasted ("Tactica", XIX.74–77) the Arabs with their heavy and slow ships ("koumbaria"), to the small and fast craft ("akatia", chiefly monoxyla), of the Slavs and Rus'.

On campaign, following the assembly of the various squadrons at fortified bases ("<a href="aplekton">aplēkta</a>") along the coast, the fleet consisted of the main body, composed of the oared warships, and the baggage train ("touldon") of sailing vessels and oared transports, which would be sent away in the event of battle. The battle fleet was divided into squadrons, and orders were transmitted from ship to ship through signal flags ("kamelaukia") and lanterns.

On the approach to and during an actual battle, a well-ordered formation was critical: if a fleet fell into disorder, its ships would be unable to lend support to each other and probably would be defeated. Fleets that failed to keep an ordered formation or that could not order themselves into an appropriate counter-formation ("antiparataxis") to match that of the enemy, often avoided, or broke off from battle. Tactical manoeuvres were therefore intended to disrupt the enemy formation, including the use of various <a href="wikt%3Astratagem">stratagems</a>, such as dividing one's force and carrying out flanking manoeuvres, feigning retreat or hiding a reserve in ambush ("Tactica", XIX.52–56). Indeed, Leo VI openly advised ("Tactica", XIX.36) against direct confrontation and advocates the use of stratagems instead. According to Leo VI ("Tactica", XIX.52), a crescent formation seems to have been the norm, with the flagship in the centre and the heavier ships at the horns of the formation, in order to turn the enemy's flanks. A range of variants and other tactics and counter-tactics was available, depending on the circumstances.

Once the fleets were close enough, exchanges of missiles began, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows and javelins. The aim was not to sink ships, but to deplete the ranks of the enemy crews before the <a href="boarding%20%28attack%29">boarding actions</a>, which decided the outcome. Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded the enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat.

Unlike the warships of Antiquity, Byzantine and Arab ships did not feature rams, and the primary means of ship-to-ship combat were boarding actions and missile fire, as well as the use of inflammable materials such as Greek fire. Despite the fearsome reputation of the latter, it was only effective under certain circumstances, and not the decisive anti-ship weapon that the ram had been in the hands of experienced crews.

Like their Roman predecessors, Byzantine and Muslim ships were equipped with small <a href="catapult">catapult</a>s ("mangana") and <a href="ballista">ballista</a>e ("toxoballistrai") that launched stones, arrows, javelins, pots of Greek fire or other incendiary liquids, <a href="caltrop">caltrop</a>s ("triboloi") and even containers full of <a href="Lime%20%28material%29">lime</a> to choke the enemy or, as Emperor Leo VI somewhat implausibly suggests, scorpions and snakes ("Tactica", XIX.61–65). Marines and the upper-bank oarsmen were heavily armoured in preparation for battle (Leo referred to them as "cataphracts") and armed with close-combat arms such as lances and swords, while the other sailors wore padded felt jackets ("neurika") for protection and fought with bows and crossbows. The importance and volume of missile fire during sea combat can be gauged from the fleet manifests for the Cretan expeditions of the 10th century, which mention 10,000 caltrops, 50 bows and 10,000 arrows, 20 hand-carried "ballistrai" with 200 bolts called "myai" ("flies") and 100 javelins per dromon.

From the 12th century on, the <a href="crossbow">crossbow</a> (called , "tzangra" in Greek) became increasingly important in Mediterranean warfare, remaining the most deadly weapon available until the advent of fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery. The Byzantines made infrequent use of the weapon, chiefly in sieges, although its use is recorded in some sea battles. <a href="Cannon">Cannon</a>s were introduced in the latter half of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, who only had a few artillery pieces for the defence of the <a href="Theodosian%20Walls">land walls</a> of Constantinople. Unlike the Venetians and Genoese, there is no indication that the Byzantines ever mounted any on ships.

"Greek fire" was the name given by Western Europeans to the flammable concoction used by the Byzantines, so called because the Europeans viewed the Byzantines as <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a>. The Byzantines themselves used various descriptive names for it, but the most common was "liquid fire" (). Although the use of incendiary chemicals by the Byzantines has been attested to since the early 6th century, the actual substance known as Greek fire is believed to have been created in 673 and is attributed to an engineer from Syria, named Kallinikos. The most common method of deployment was to emit the formula through a large bronze tube ("siphōn") onto enemy ships. Alternatively, it could be launched in jars fired from catapults; pivoting <a href="Crane%20%28machine%29">cranes</a> ("gerania") are also mentioned as a method of pouring combustibles onto enemy ships. Usually the mixture would be stored in heated, pressurized barrels and projected through the tube by some sort of pump while the operators were sheltered behind large iron shields. A portable version ("cheirosiphōn") also existed, reputedly invented by Leo VI, making it the direct analogue to a modern <a href="flamethrower">flamethrower</a>. The means of its production was kept a state secret, and its components are only roughly guessed or described through secondary sources like <a href="Anna%20Komnene">Anna Komnene</a>, so that its exact composition remains to this day unknown. In its effect, the Greek fire must have been rather similar to <a href="napalm">napalm</a>. Contemporary sources make clear that it could not be extinguished by water, but rather floated and burned on top of it; sand could extinguish it by depriving it of oxygen, and several authors also mention strong vinegar and old urine as being able to extinguish it, presumably by some sort of chemical reaction. Consequently, felt or hides soaked in vinegar were used to provide protection against it.

Despite the somewhat exaggerated accounts of Byzantine writers, it was by no means a "wonder weapon", and did not avert some serious defeats. Given its limited range, and the need for a calm sea and favourable wind conditions, its usability was limited. Nevertheless, in favourable circumstances and against an unprepared enemy, its great destructive ability and psychological impact could prove decisive, as displayed repeatedly against the Rus'. Greek fire continued to be mentioned during the 12th century, but the Byzantines failed to use it against the Fourth Crusade, possibly because they had lost access to the areas (the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and the eastern coast of the Black Sea) where the primary ingredients were to be found. The Arabs fielded their own "liquid fire" after 835, but it is unknown if they used the Byzantine formula, possibly obtained through espionage or through the defection of "stratēgos" Euphemios in 827, or whether they independently created a version of their own. A 12th-century treatise prepared by <a href="Mardi%20bin%20Ali%20al-Tarsusi">Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi</a> for <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a> records a version of Greek fire, called "naft" (from <a href="naphtha">naphtha</a>), which had a <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a> base, with sulphur and various resins added.

It is not easy to assess the importance of the Byzantine navy to the Empire's history. On one hand, the Empire, throughout its life, had to defend a long coastline, often with little <a href="hinterland">hinterland</a>. In addition, shipping was always the quickest and cheapest way of transport, and the Empire's major urban and commercial centres, as well as most of its fertile areas, lay close to the sea. Coupled with the threat posed by the Arabs in the 7th to 10th centuries, this necessitated the maintenance of a strong fleet. The navy was perhaps at its most significant in the successful defence of Constantinople from the two Arab sieges, which ultimately saved the Empire. Throughout the period however, naval operations were an essential part of the Byzantine effort against the Arabs in a game of raids and counter-raids that continued up to the late 10th century.

On the other hand, the nature and limitations of the maritime technology of the age meant that the neither the Byzantines nor any of their opponents could develop a true <a href="thalassocracy">thalassocracy</a>. Galley fleets were confined to coastal operations, and were not able to play a truly independent role. Furthermore, as the alternation of Byzantine victories and defeats against the Arabs illustrates, no side was able to permanently gain the upper hand. Although the Byzantines pulled off a number of spectacular successes, such as Nasar's remarkable night-time victory in 880 (one of a handful of similar engagements in the Middle Ages), these victories were balanced off by similarly disastrous losses. Reports of mutinies by oarsmen in Byzantine fleets also reveal that conditions were often far from the ideal prescribed in the manuals. Combined with the traditional predominance of the great <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>n land-holders in the higher <a href="Byzantine%20aristocracy%20and%20bureaucracy">military and civil offices</a>, all this meant that, as in the Roman Empire, the navy, even at its height, was still regarded largely as an adjunct to the land forces. This fact is clearly illustrated by the relatively lowly positions its admirals held in the imperial hierarchy.

It is clear nevertheless that the gradual decline of the indigenous Byzantine naval power in the 10th and 11th centuries, when it was eclipsed by the Italian city-states, chiefly Venice and later Genoa, was of great long-term significance for the fate of the Empire. The sack of the Fourth Crusade, which shattered the foundations of the Byzantine state, was due in large part to the absolute defencelessness of the Empire at sea. This process was initiated by Byzantium itself in the 9th century, when the Italians were increasingly employed by the Empire to compensate for its own naval weakness in the West. The Italian republics also profited from their role as intermediaries in the trade between the Empire and Western Europe, marginalizing the Byzantine merchant marine, which in turn had adverse effects on the availability of Byzantine naval forces. Inevitably however, as the Italian republics slowly moved away from the Byzantine orbit, they began pursuing their own policies, and from the late 11th century on, they turned from protection of the Empire to exploitation and sometimes outright plunder, heralding the eventual financial and political subjugation of Byzantium to their interests. The absence of a strong navy was certainly keenly felt by the Byzantines at the time, as the comments of Kekaumenos illustrate. Strong and energetic emperors like Manuel Komnenos, and later Michael VIII Palaiologos, could revive Byzantine naval power, but even after landing heavy strokes against the Venetians, they merely replaced them with the Genoese and the Pisans. Trade thus remained in Latin hands, its profits continued to be siphoned off from the Empire, and after their deaths, their achievements quickly evaporated. After 1204, and with the brief exception of Michael VIII's reign, the fortunes of the now small Byzantine navy were more or less tied to the shifting alliances with the Italian maritime republics.

When viewing the entire course of Byzantine history, the waxing and waning of the navy's strength closely mirrors the fluctuation of the Empire's fortunes. It is this apparent interrelation that led the French Byzantinist <a href="Louis%20Br%C3%A9hier">Louis Bréhier</a> to remark: "The epochs of [Byzantium's] dominion are those in which it held control of the sea, and it was when it lost it, that its reverses began."

William James Nesbitt, (born 15 January 1965) is an actor and presenter from <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Born in <a href="Ballymena">Ballymena</a>, <a href="County%20Antrim">County Antrim</a>, Nesbitt grew up in the nearby village of <a href="Broughshane">Broughshane</a>, before moving to <a href="Coleraine">Coleraine</a>, <a href="County%20Londonderry">County Londonderry</a>. He wanted to become a teacher like his father, so he began a degree in French at the <a href="University%20of%20Ulster">University of Ulster</a>. He dropped out after a year when he decided to become an actor, and transferred to the <a href="Central%20School%20of%20Speech%20and%20Drama">Central School of Speech and Drama</a> in London. After graduating in 1987, he spent seven years performing in plays that varied from the musical "<a href="Up%20on%20the%20Roof%20%28musical%29">Up on the Roof</a>" (1987, 1989) to the political drama "Paddywack" (1994). He made his feature film debut playing <a href="talent%20agent">talent agent</a> Fintan O'Donnell in "<a href="Hear%20My%20Song">Hear My Song</a>" (1991).

Nesbitt got his breakthrough television role playing Adam Williams in the romantic comedy-drama "<a href="Cold%20Feet">Cold Feet</a>" (1998–2003), which won him a <a href="British%20Comedy%20Awards">British Comedy Award</a>, a <a href="Television%20and%20Radio%20Industries%20Club">Television and Radio Industries Club Award</a>, and a <a href="National%20Television%20Awards">National Television Award</a>. His first significant film role came when he appeared as pig farmer "Pig" Finn in "<a href="Waking%20Ned">Waking Ned</a>" (1998). With the rest of the starring cast, Nesbitt was nominated for a <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Awards">Screen Actors Guild Award</a>. In "<a href="Lucky%20Break%20%282001%20film%29">Lucky Break</a>" (2001), he made his debut as a film lead, playing prisoner Jimmy Hands. The next year, he played <a href="Ivan%20Cooper">Ivan Cooper</a> in the television film "<a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%28film%29">Bloody Sunday</a>", about the <a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%281972%29">1972 shootings in Derry</a>. A departure from his previous "cheeky chappie" roles, the film was a turning point in his career. He won a <a href="British%20Independent%20Film%20Awards">British Independent Film Award</a> and was nominated for the <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">British Academy Television Award for Best Actor</a>.

Nesbitt has also starred in "<a href="Murphy%27s%20Law%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Murphy's Law</a>" (2001–2007) as undercover detective Tommy Murphy, in a role that was created for him by writer <a href="Colin%20Bateman">Colin Bateman</a>. The role twice gained Nesbitt Best Actor nominations at the <a href="Irish%20Film%20and%20Television%20Awards">Irish Film & Television Awards</a> (IFTA). In 2007, he starred in the dual role of Tom Jackman and Mr Hyde in <a href="Steven%20Moffat">Steven Moffat</a>'s "<a href="Jekyll%20%28TV%20series%29">Jekyll</a>", which earned him a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Awards">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination in 2008. Nesbitt has since appeared in several more dramatic roles; he starred alongside <a href="Liam%20Neeson">Liam Neeson</a> in "<a href="Five%20Minutes%20of%20Heaven">Five Minutes of Heaven</a>" (2009), and was one of three lead actors in the television miniseries "<a href="Occupation%20%28TV%20serial%29">Occupation</a>" (2009). He also starred in the movies "<a href="Outcast%20%282010%20film%29">Outcast</a>" (2010) and "<a href="The%20Way%20%282010%20film%29">The Way</a>" (2010). He portrayed <a href="Bofur">Bofur</a> in <a href="Peter%20Jackson">Peter Jackson's</a> <a href="The%20Hobbit%20%28film%20series%29">The Hobbit</a> film series (2012-2014). In 2014, Nesbitt starred in the lead role as the father character Tony Hughes in the acclaim <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> drama series "<a href="The%20Missing%20%28TV%20series%29">The Missing</a>".

Nesbitt was married to former actress Sonia Forbes-Adam, with whom he has two daughters. He is an advocate of numerous charities, and in 2010 he accepted the ceremonial position of <a href="Chancellor%20%28education%29">Chancellor</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Ulster">University of Ulster</a>.

James Nesbitt was born on 15 January 1965 in <a href="Ballymena">Ballymena</a>, <a href="County%20Antrim">County Antrim</a>, <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. His father, James "Jim" Nesbitt, was the headmaster of the primary school in Lisnamurrican, a hamlet near <a href="Broughshane">Broughshane</a>, while his mother, May Nesbitt, was a civil servant. Jim and May already had three daughters—Margaret, Kathryn and Andrea. Nesbitt's three sisters all eventually became teachers. The family lived in the house adjoining the one-room school where Nesbitt was one of 32 pupils taught by Jim; the other pupils were all farmers' children. Nesbitt grew up "completely" around women, and spent a lot of time alone, "kicking a ball against a wall". He had ambitions to play <a href="association%20football">football</a> for <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, or to become a teacher like his father. The family was Protestant, and Lisnamurrican was in "<a href="Ian%20Paisley">Paisley</a> country". The Nesbitts spent Sunday evenings singing hymns around the piano. Jim marched in the Ballymena Young Conquerors flute band and Nesbitt joined him playing the flute. After the <a href="Drumcree%20conflict">Drumcree conflict</a>s, they stopped marching with the band. The family's residence in the countryside left them largely unaffected by <a href="The%20Troubles">The Troubles</a>, although Nesbitt, his father, and one of his sisters narrowly escaped a car bomb explosion outside Ballymena County Hall in the early 1970s.

When Nesbitt was 11 years old, the family moved to <a href="Coleraine">Coleraine</a>, <a href="County%20Londonderry">County Londonderry</a>, where May worked for the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Housing%20Executive">Housing Executive</a>. He completed his primary education at Blagh primary school, then moved on to <a href="Coleraine%20Academical%20Institution">Coleraine Academical Institution</a> (CAI). In 1978, when he was 13, his parents took him to audition for the <a href="Riverside%20Theatre%2C%20Coleraine">Riverside Theatre</a>'s Christmas production of "<a href="Oliver%21">Oliver!</a>". Nesbitt sang "<a href="Bohemian%20Rhapsody">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>" at the audition and won the part of the <a href="Artful%20Dodger">Artful Dodger</a>, who he played in his acting debut. He continued to act and sing with the Riverside until he was 16, and appeared at festivals and as an extra in "Play For Today: The Cry" (<a href="Christopher%20Menaul">Christopher Menaul</a>, 1984). He got his <a href="Equity%20%28trade%20union%29">Equity card</a> when the professional actor playing <a href="Jiminy%20Cricket">Jiminy Cricket</a> in "<a href="Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a>" broke his ankle two days before the performance, and Nesbitt stepped in to take his place. Acting had not initially appealed to him, but he "felt a light go on" after he saw "<a href="The%20Winslow%20Boy%20%281948%20film%29">The Winslow Boy</a>" (<a href="Anthony%20Asquith">Anthony Asquith</a>, 1948). When he was 15, he got his first paid job as a bingo caller at <a href="Barry%27s%20Amusements">Barry's Amusements</a> in <a href="Portrush">Portrush</a>. He was paid £1 per hour for the summer job and would also, on occasions, work as the brake man on the big dipper.

He left CAI at the age of 18 and began a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in <a href="Jordanstown">Jordanstown</a>. He stayed at university for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football." He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an overdue essay on existentialism in "<a href="Les%20Mains%20Sales">Les Mains Sales</a>" at 4 am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the <a href="Central%20School%20of%20Speech%20and%20Drama">Central School of Speech and Drama</a> (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. And I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'" He graduated in 1987, at the age of 22.

The day after leaving CSSD in 1987, Nesbitt got a bit part in "Virtuoso", a <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> "Screen Two" television play about the life of <a href="John%20Ogdon">John Ogdon</a>. He worked for two days on the play, earning £250 per day. His first professional stage appearance came in the same year, when he played Keith in "<a href="Up%20on%20the%20Roof%20%28musical%29">Up on the Roof</a>". The musical ran at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Plymouth">Theatre Royal, Plymouth</a>, before transferring to the <a href="London%20West%20End">London West End</a>. Nesbitt reprised the role when the production returned to Plymouth in early 1989. Roger Malone in "<a href="The%20Stage">The Stage and Television Today</a>" wrote that Nesbitt "steals the show with the best lines and best delivery as he laconically squares up to life with an easy contentment". Nesbitt appeared in two other plays in 1989; in June, he played Dukes Frederick and Senior in Paul Jepson's "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>" at the Rose Theatre Club, and then appeared in <a href="Yuri%20Lyubimov">Yuri Lyubimov</a>'s version of "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>". "Hamlet" had been translated back to English from <a href="Boris%20Pasternak">Boris Pasternak</a>'s Russian translation. It ran at the <a href="Haymarket%20Theatre%20%28Leicester%29">Haymarket Theatre, Leicester</a> for a month before a transfer to the <a href="Old%20Vic">Old Vic</a> and then a nine-month world tour. Nesbitt played <a href="Guildenstern">Guildenstern</a>, Barnardo and the second gravedigger. He recalled that the play received "shocking" reviews, but was exciting.

In the early 1990s, he lived with fellow actor <a href="Jerome%20Flynn">Jerome Flynn</a> and earned money by signing fan mail for the successful star of "<a href="Soldier%20Soldier">Soldier Soldier</a>". In his debut feature film, "<a href="Hear%20My%20Song">Hear My Song</a>" (<a href="Peter%20Chelsom">Peter Chelsom</a>, 1991), Nesbitt played Fintan O'Donnell, a struggling theatrical agent and friend of Mickey O'Neill (<a href="Adrian%20Dunbar">Adrian Dunbar</a>). A "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" critic wrote, "the jaunty, bemused Mr. Nesbitt, manages to combine soulfulness with sly humor". The praise he received made him self-assured and complacent; in 2001, he recalled, "When I did "Hear My Song", I disappeared so far up my own arse afterwards. I thought, 'Oh, that's it, I've cracked it.' And I'm glad that happened, because you then find out how expendable actors are." His attitude left him out of work for six months after the film was released. Until 1994, he mixed his stage roles with supporting roles on television in episodes of "<a href="Boon%20%28TV%20series%29">Boon</a>", "<a href="The%20Young%20Indiana%20Jones%20Chronicles">The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</a>", "<a href="Covington%20Cross">Covington Cross</a>", "<a href="Lovejoy">Lovejoy</a>", and "<a href="Between%20the%20Lines%20%28TV%20series%29">Between the Lines</a>". In 1993, he appeared in "Love Lies Bleeding", an instalment of the BBC anthology series "Screenplay" and his first appearance in a production directed by <a href="Michael%20Winterbottom">Michael Winterbottom</a>; he later appeared in "<a href="Go%20Now%20%28film%29">Go Now</a>" (1995), "<a href="Jude%20%28film%29">Jude</a>" (1996) and "<a href="Welcome%20to%20Sarajevo">Welcome to Sarajevo</a>" (1997). A "<a href="The%20Guardian">Guardian</a>" journalist wrote that "he showed himself to be a generous supporting actor" in "Jude" and "Sarajevo".

Back on stage, he appeared as Doalty in "<a href="Translations">Translations</a>" (Gwenda Hughes, <a href="Birmingham%20Repertory%20Theatre">Birmingham Repertory Theatre</a>, 1991), Aidan in "<a href="Una%20Pooka">Una Pooka</a>" (Mark Lambert and <a href="Nicholas%20Kent">Nicholas Kent</a>, <a href="Tricycle%20Theatre">Tricycle Theatre</a>, 1992), Damien in "<a href="Paddywack">Paddywack</a>" (<a href="Michael%20Latimer">Michael Latimer</a>) , <a href="Cockpit%20Theatre%20%28Marylebone%29">Cockpit Theatre</a>, 1994), and Jesus in "<a href="Darwin%27s%20Flood">Darwin's Flood</a>" (Simon Stokes, <a href="Bush%20Theatre">Bush Theatre</a>, 1994). "Paddywack", in which Nesbitt's character is suspected by others of being an <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">IRA</a> member, transferred to the United States for a run at the <a href="Long%20Wharf%20Theatre">Long Wharf Theatre</a> in <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a> in October 1994. A "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" critic called Damien "the play's only fully developed character" and commended Nesbitt for giving "the one strong, telling performance [of the cast]". In 1996, Nesbitt appeared in an episode of the <a href="BBC%20Northern%20Ireland">BBC Northern Ireland</a> television drama "<a href="Ballykissangel">Ballykissangel</a>", playing Leo McGarvey, the ex-boyfriend of Assumpta Fitzgerald (<a href="Dervla%20Kirwan">Dervla Kirwan</a>) and love rival of Peter Clifford (<a href="Stephen%20Tompkinson">Stephen Tompkinson</a>). He reprised the role for four episodes in 1998.

In 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, the male lead in "<a href="Pilot%20%28Cold%20Feet%29">Cold Feet</a>", an ITV <a href="Comedy%20Premieres">Comedy Premiere</a> about three couples in different stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, <a href="Declan%20Lowney">Declan Lowney</a>. The producer, <a href="Christine%20Langan">Christine Langan</a>, had also recalled his performances in "Hear My Song" and "Go Now". Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play him—English writer <a href="Mike%20Bullen">Mike Bullen</a> had written the character as a thinly veiled portrayal of himself in his youth—but Nesbitt wanted to take the opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as an ordinary man from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of "Love Lies Bleeding". "Cold Feet" was a critical success; it won the 1997 <a href="Golden%20Rose%20of%20Montreux">Golden Rose of Montreux</a> and the 1997 <a href="British%20Comedy%20Awards">British Comedy Award</a> for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. "<a href="Cold%20Feet">Cold Feet</a>"s first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with <a href="testicular%20cancer">testicular cancer</a>, which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action Cancer. By the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's <a href="stag%20weekend">stag weekend</a> was due to be filmed on location in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to quit to move on to other projects. Executive producer <a href="Andy%20Harries">Andy Harries</a> persuaded him to stay for one more series by suggesting that Adam be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by <a href="Helen%20Baxendale">Helen Baxendale</a>) instead.

"Cold Feet" ran for five years from 1998 to 2003, and Nesbitt won the British Comedy Award for Best TV Comedy Actor in 2000, the <a href="Television%20and%20Radio%20Industries%20Club">Television and Radio Industries Club Award</a> for Drama TV Performer of the Year in 2002, the <a href="National%20Television%20Awards">National Television Award</a> for Most Popular Comedy Performance in 2003, and the <a href="TV%20Quick">TV Quick Award</a> for Best Actor in 2003. Nesbitt credits the role with raising his profile with the public. Further television roles during these five years included women's football team coach John Dolan in the first two series of <a href="Kay%20Mellor">Kay Mellor</a>'s "<a href="Playing%20the%20Field">Playing the Field</a>" (appearing alongside his "Cold Feet" co-star <a href="John%20Thomson%20%28comedian%29">John Thomson</a>), investigative journalists Ryan and David Laney in "<a href="Resurrection%20Man%20%28film%29">Resurrection Man</a>" (<a href="Marc%20Evans">Marc Evans</a>, 1998) and "<a href="Touching%20Evil">Touching Evil II</a>" respectively, and womaniser Stanley in "<a href="Women%20Talking%20Dirty">Women Talking Dirty</a>" (<a href="Coky%20Giedroyc">Coky Giedroyc</a>, 1999).

Nesbitt's performance in "Hear My Song" had also impressed first-time screenwriter and film director Kirk Jones, who cast him in his 1998 feature film "<a href="Waking%20Ned">Waking Ned</a>". Playing amiable pig farmer "Pig" Finn brought Nesbitt to international attention, particularly in the United States (where the film was released as "Waking Ned Devine"); the cast was nominated for the 1999 <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Cast%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture">Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Theatrical Motion Picture</a>. In 1999, he appeared as the paramilitary "Mad Dog" Billy Wilson in "<a href="The%20Most%20Fertile%20Man%20in%20Ireland">The Most Fertile Man in Ireland</a>" (<a href="Dudi%20Appleton">Dudi Appleton</a>). The following year, he appeared in Declan Lowney's feature debut, "<a href="Wild%20About%20Harry%20%282000%20film%29">Wild About Harry</a>". Lowney had personally asked him to appear in the supporting role of cross-dressing <a href="Unionism%20in%20Ireland">Unionist</a> politician Walter Adair. In 2001, he made his debut as a lead actor in a feature film in <a href="Peter%20Cattaneo">Peter Cattaneo</a>'s "<a href="Lucky%20Break%20%282001%20film%29">Lucky Break</a>". He played Jimmy Hands, an incompetent bank robber who masterminds an escape from a prison by staging a musical as a distraction. On preparing for the role, Nesbitt said, "Short of robbing a bank there wasn't much research I could have done but we did spend a day in Wandsworth Prison and that showed the nightmare monotony of prisoners' lives. I didn't interview any of the inmates because I thought it would be a little patronising as it was research for a comedy and also because we were going home every night in our fancy cars to sleep in our fancy hotels." The film was a commercial failure, despite receiving good feedback from test audiences in the United States.

Nesbitt had been approached at a British Academy Television Awards ceremony by director <a href="Paul%20Greengrass">Paul Greengrass</a>, who wanted him to star in a television drama he was making about the <a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%281972%29">1972 "Bloody Sunday" shootings</a> in Derry. Nesbitt was only seven years old when the shootings happened and was ignorant of its cause; he believed that there was "no smoke without fire" and that the Catholic marchers must have done something to provoke the British Army. He was filming "Cold Feet" in Manchester when he received the script. He read it and found that had "an extraordinary effect" on him. Nesbitt played <a href="Ivan%20Cooper">Ivan Cooper</a> in "<a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%28film%29">Bloody Sunday</a>", the man who pressed for the march to go ahead. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Cooper and spent many hours talking to him about his motives on that day. He met with relatives of the victims and watched the televised <a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20Inquiry">Bloody Sunday Inquiry</a> with them, and also read <a href="Don%20Mullan">Don Mullan</a>'s "Eyewitness Bloody Sunday" and Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson's "Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?". Greengrass compared Nesbitt's preparation to an athlete preparing for a race, and told "The Observer", "For an Irish actor, doing the Troubles is like doing "Lear"." Nesbitt had questioned whether he was a good enough actor to effectively portray Cooper and was worried what Derry Catholics would think of a Protestant playing the lead, although Ivan Cooper himself is a Protestant.

Shortly before "Bloody Sunday" was broadcast, Nesbitt described it as "difficult but extraordinary" and "emotionally draining". The broadcast on ITV in January 2002 and its promotion did not pass without incident; he was criticised by Unionists for saying that Protestants in Northern Ireland felt "a collective guilt" over the killings. His parents' home was also vandalised and he received death threats. During the awards season, Nesbitt won the <a href="British%20Independent%20Film%20Awards">British Independent Film Award</a> for Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film and was nominated for the <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">British Academy Television Award for Best Actor</a>. The film was also screened at film festivals such as the <a href="Stockholm%20International%20Film%20Festival">Stockholm International Film Festival</a>, where Nesbitt was presented with the Best Actor award.

In an analysis of the film in the "History & Memory" journal, Aileen Blaney wrote that it is Nesbitt's real-life household name status that made his portrayal of Cooper such a success. She reasoned that Nesbitt's celebrity status mirrors that of Cooper's in the 1970s: "A household name across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic [sic], Nesbitt's widespread popular appeal is emphatically not contingent upon his Protestant Ulster identity, and consequently the double-voicing of the character he plays does not alienate viewers of an alternative, or no, sectarian persuasion." "Guardian" journalist Susie Steiner suggested that his appearance in "Bloody Sunday" was an attempt to resolve the expression of his "Irishness" on screen: "Where he has taken part in a sectarian theme, his intelligence as an actor has often been masked by an excessive, cartoon-style comedy. Yet in his more successful, high-profile roles, (notably in "Cold Feet", and as Pig Finn in the gently pastoral film "Waking Ned"), Nesbitt's Irishness has been exploited for its romantic charm. It has been sugared and, in the process, de-politicised." A critic identified "Bloody Sunday" as Nesbitt's "coming of age" film, and Nesbitt called it a turning point in his career. He refers to his career since the film was released as "post-"Bloody Sunday"".

In 2003, Nesbitt played undercover police detective Tommy Murphy in the first series of "<a href="Murphy%27s%20Law%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Murphy's Law</a>", after starring in a successful pilot episode in 2001. The series was conceived when Nesbitt was working on "Playing the Field"; he and producer Greg Brenman approached author <a href="Colin%20Bateman">Colin Bateman</a> about creating a television series for Nesbitt in a similar vein to Bateman's Dan Starkey novels. Bateman and Nesbitt were already well acquainted; Nesbitt had been considered for a main role in "<a href="Divorcing%20Jack%20%28film%29">Divorcing Jack</a>" (<a href="David%20Caffrey">David Caffrey</a>, 1998), based on Bateman's original novel. A 90-minute pilot of "Murphy's Law" was commissioned by the BBC, initially as a "comedy action adventure". Bateman created a complex backstory for Murphy, which was cut at the request of the producers. After the broadcast of the pilot, "Guardian" critic Gareth McLean wrote, "the likeable James Nesbitt turned in a strong, extremely watchable central performance, though rarely did he look taxed by his efforts, and his chemistry with [Claudia] Harrison was promising and occasionally electric." In 2003, Nesbitt won the <a href="Irish%20Film%20and%20Television%20Awards">Irish Film & Television Award</a> (IFTA) for Best Actor in a TV Drama for the role. The second series was broadcast in 2004.

By 2005, Nesbitt had become tired of the formula and threatened to quit unless the structure of the series was changed. He was made a creative consultant and suggested that Murphy keep one undercover role for a full series, instead of changing into a new guise every episode. This new dramatic element to the series was intended to make it a closer representation of real-life undercover work. Alongside his research with former undercover officer Peter Bleksley, Nesbitt hired a personal trainer and grew a <a href="handlebar%20moustache">handlebar moustache</a> to change Murphy's physical characteristics and tone down the "cheeky chappie" persona that the audience had become accustomed to from his roles. With his trainer, he worked out three times a week, boxing and doing circuits and weights. After the first new episode was broadcast, Sarah Vine wrote in "The Times", "In the past, when attempting a nasty stare or a hard face, Nesbitt has never managed much more than a faintly quizzical look, hilarity forever threatening to break out behind those twinkly Irish eyes. But here, it's different. He genuinely has the air of a man who means business." The refreshed series marked another milestone in Nesbitt's career; he describes it as "a big moment" in his life. "Murphy's Law" was not recommissioned for a sixth series, which Nesbitt attributed to the damage done to the fifth series ratings when it was scheduled opposite the popular ITV drama "<a href="Doc%20Martin">Doc Martin</a>".

In 2004, Nesbitt appeared in "<a href="Wall%20of%20Silence">Wall of Silence</a>", a fact-based drama about the aftermath of the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy's father, who tries to break down the wall of silence in the local community to discover exactly what happened to his son. He had only just completed "Bloody Sunday" when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the part because he found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe's fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe's South London speech, as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single-drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January 2004. The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year.

In March 2004, he appeared in <a href="Tony%20Marchant%20%28playwright%29">Tony Marchant</a>'s "<a href="Passer%20By%20%28film%29">Passer By</a>", playing Joe Keyes, a man who witnesses a woman being accosted by some men on a train and chooses not to help. Keyes later discovers that the woman was raped but cannot bring himself to admit in court that he did nothing to help her. Nesbitt described Keyes as "like a better man than me: a good father and husband. But, once he has made a wrong decision, he can't control everything in his life, as he thinks he is weak. He loses the respect of his wife, his son and at work, and has to reach the lowest possible point before finding redemption." As a result of these serious roles, he was named the <a href="Radio%20Times%27s%20Most%20Powerful%20People%20in%20Drama">sixth most powerful figure in TV drama</a> in a listing compiled by industry experts for the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>". In September 2004, he starred as Jack Parlabane in the ITV adaptation of <a href="Christopher%20Brookmyre">Christopher Brookmyre</a>'s "<a href="Quite%20Ugly%20One%20Morning">Quite Ugly One Morning</a>". The producers originally wanted Scottish actor <a href="Douglas%20Henshall">Douglas Henshall</a> to play Glaswegian Parlabane but ITV executives overruled them and cast Nesbitt. He was given coaching to perfect the accent but it was soon discarded on the advice of both the director and his co-star <a href="Daniela%20Nardini">Daniela Nardini</a>. Also in 2004, he filmed the roles of Ronnie Cunningham in "<a href="Millions%20%282004%20film%29">Millions</a>" (<a href="Danny%20Boyle">Danny Boyle</a>, 2004), and Detective Banner in "<a href="Match%20Point">Match Point</a>" (<a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a>, 2005). He was considering taking time off from acting and did not really want the role in "Match Point". He sent in an audition tape and was accepted for the part. Nesbitt's character appears at the end of the film and he read only that part of the script, so did not know the full circumstances of the crime Banner investigates. Despite his initial reluctance, Nesbitt enjoyed working with Allen, and complimented him on his directing style.

Nesbitt returned to theatre acting in June 2005 when he appeared in <a href="David%20Nicholls%20%28writer%29">David Nicholls</a>' "After Sun", a ten-minute-play performed as part of the <a href="Old%20Vic">Old Vic</a>'s 24-Hour Play season. Nesbitt and <a href="Catherine%20Tate">Catherine Tate</a> starred as a married couple who meet a pair of newlyweds returning from their honeymoon. Later that year, he appeared in his first full-length play in 11 years, in <a href="Owen%20McCafferty">Owen McCafferty</a>'s "<a href="Shoot%20the%20Crow">Shoot the Crow</a>". He enjoyed the stimulation of learning his lines and rehearsing with the cast and director. The play opened at the Trafalgar Studios in September 2005 and his role as Socrates gained mixed reviews. In "The Independent", Michael Coveney suggested the role did not fit the actor: "Nesbitt is cool. But I never felt that he was inside his role of a chap called Socrates [...] He grinned and shrugged through the evening which steadily became less about grouting on tiles and more about grating on nerves." In "The Daily Telegraph", <a href="Charles%20Spencer%20%28journalist%29">Charles Spencer</a> described Nesbitt's acting as "outstanding".

At the end of 2005, Nesbitt and his agent met with BBC Controller of Fiction <a href="Jane%20Tranter">Jane Tranter</a> to discuss a new series of "Murphy's Law". At the meeting's conclusion, Tranter offered Nesbitt the first episode script of "<a href="Jekyll%20%28TV%20series%29">Jekyll</a>", a television series by <a href="Steven%20Moffat">Steven Moffat</a> that updated "<a href="Strange%20Case%20of%20Dr%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr%20Hyde">Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</a>". Nesbitt spent three hours reading the script before accepting the role of Tom Jackman—and his alter-ego Mr Hyde. After signing on for the role, he met with Moffat and <a href="Hartswood%20Films">Hartswood Films</a> executive producer <a href="Beryl%20Vertue">Beryl Vertue</a> to discuss the character, and had several make-up tests. His anticipation for the part was heightened because filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006. Nesbitt spent an hour each day being made up as Hyde; a wig altered his hairline and prosthetics were added to his chin, nose and ear lobes. He also wore black contact lenses to make Hyde "soulless", though CGI was used to show the transformation from Jackman in close-ups. The series was broadcast on BBC One in June and July 2007. The role secured him a nomination from the <a href="Hollywood%20Foreign%20Press%20Association">Hollywood Foreign Press Association</a> for the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20-%20Miniseries%20or%20Television%20Film">Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television</a>, and a nomination for the Rose d'Or for Best Entertainer.

In 2008, he portrayed <a href="Pontius%20Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a> in "<a href="The%20Passion%20%28TV%20serial%29">The Passion</a>", a BBC/HBO adaptation of the last week in the life of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>. He had originally rejected the script due to other filming commitments, but accepted the role after his agent told him to re-read it before making a final decision. He was pleased to learn that the serial was being produced by <a href="Nigel%20Stafford-Clark">Nigel Stafford-Clark</a>, whose "<a href="Bleak%20House%20%282005%20TV%20serial%29">Bleak House</a>" adaptation he had enjoyed, and that he would be appearing with his "Jekyll" co-star <a href="Denis%20Lawson">Denis Lawson</a>. Contrary to previous portrayals of Pilate, Nesbitt played the biblical figure as "nice", and—as when playing Jack Parlabane—used his own accent. The serial was broadcast in the UK during Easter week 2008. Shortly after filming "The Passion", he filmed the part of journalist Max Raban in the <a href="Carnival%20Films">Carnival Films</a> thriller "<a href="Midnight%20Man%20%28miniseries%29">Midnight Man</a>", which was shown on ITV in May 2008. It won him a joint nomination (along with the 2007 series of "Murphy's Law") for the <a href="ITV3%20Crime%20Thriller%20Awards">ITV3 Crime Thriller Award for Best Actor</a>. At the end of the year, he had a starring role in the low-budget independent film "<a href="Blessed%20%282008%20film%29">Blessed</a>". The writer and director Mark Aldridge scripted the character of Peter with Nesbitt in mind to play him. The film had a limited release throughout 2008 and 2009 before the BBC screened it on television in 2010. Nesbitt said, "The role of Peter is what I have dreamed about playing, you wait your whole life for an opportunity like this and when it comes you have to grab it."

The following year, Nesbitt co-starred with <a href="Liam%20Neeson">Liam Neeson</a> in the fact-based television film "<a href="Five%20Minutes%20of%20Heaven">Five Minutes of Heaven</a>" (<a href="Oliver%20Hirschbiegel">Oliver Hirschbiegel</a>, 2009). The first part of the film dramatises the real-life murder of Jim Griffin by Alistair Little in 1970s <a href="Lurgan">Lurgan</a>; the second part features a fictional meeting between Little (Neeson) and Jim's brother Joe (Nesbitt) 33 years later. Nesbitt met with Griffin before filming began to learn about how his brother's murder affected him. The film was broadcast on BBC Two in April 2009. He also starred as Colour Sgt. Mike Swift in <a href="Peter%20Bowker">Peter Bowker</a>'s three-part BBC/Kudos television serial "<a href="Occupation%20%28TV%20serial%29">Occupation</a>". In "Occupation", set over six years, Nesbitt's character is one of three British soldiers who return to <a href="Basra">Basra</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> after their tours have concluded. He researched the role by speaking to <a href="Territorial%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> soldiers in Belfast, and <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a> officers in Morocco, where the serial was filmed. Both performances were commended by "Independent" journalist Hugh Montgomery; in a review of 2009's television, Montgomery named Nesbitt "Face of the Year", writing, "Just as you had James Nesbitt written off as the gurning embodiment of everything mediocre about British TV drama, he produced two stonking performances, as the transfixingly harrowed sergeant in "Occupation", and a nervily vengeful victim's relative in Irish-troubles piece "Five Minutes of Heaven". Give the man a Bafta." Nesbitt was not nominated for a BAFTA award, though did receive a nomination for Best Actor from the <a href="Broadcasting%20Press%20Guild">Broadcasting Press Guild</a> for both performances.

In March 2009, Nesbitt signed a contract with the American talent agency <a href="United%20Talent%20Agency">United Talent Agency</a>, as the <a href="Late-2000s%20financial%20crisis">global financial crisis</a> was restricting roles in British television. He continued to be represented in the United Kingdom by Artists Rights Group. The next year Nesbitt played the hunter Cathal in the low-budget British horror film "<a href="Outcast%20%282010%20film%29">Outcast</a>", which was a departure from his previous character types. After screening at major international film festivals in early 2010, the film had a general release in the latter part of the year. Nesbitt had previously worked with the film's director and co-writer Colm McCarthy on "Murphy's Law", which was one reason he took the role. He researched the mythical aspects of the character by reading about Irish folklore and beliefs. He also starred alongside <a href="Minnie%20Driver">Minnie Driver</a> and his "Welcome to Sarajevo" co-star <a href="Goran%20Vi%C5%A1nji%C4%87">Goran Višnjić</a> in the Tiger Aspect television serial "<a href="The%20Deep%20%28TV%20serial%29">The Deep</a>". In the five-part drama, Nesbitt played submarine engineer Clem Donnelly. The serial was filmed over 12 weeks at <a href="BBC%20Scotland">BBC Scotland</a>'s studios in <a href="Dumbarton">Dumbarton</a>. August 2010 saw the release of <a href="Nadia%20Tass">Nadia Tass</a>'s film "<a href="Matching%20Jack">Matching Jack</a>", in which Nesbitt plays the leading role of Connor. He became involved in the film after reading an early script draft in 2006. In 2008, the global financial crisis severely reduced the budget of the film, and Nesbitt volunteered a reduction in his salary so the film could still be made. The film was shot over eight weeks in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in 2009 and released in 2010.

Next, Nesbitt reunited with "Occupation" screenwriter Peter Bowker to star in the ITV medical drama series "<a href="Monroe%20%28TV%20series%29">Monroe</a>", playing Gabriel Monroe. Nesbitt was Bowker's first choice for the part. Nesbitt researched the role of the <a href="neurosurgery">neurosurgeon</a> character by watching brain surgery being performed by <a href="Henry%20Marsh%20%28neurosurgeon%29">Henry Marsh</a>, and by consulting Philip Van Hille at <a href="Leeds%20General%20Infirmary">Leeds General Infirmary</a>. The series was filmed over 12 weeks in Leeds at the end of 2010 and broadcast on ITV during March and April 2011. Nesbitt will reprise the role in a second series, which is due to begin production in 2012. In film, Nesbitt co-stars as Irish writer Jack in <a href="Emilio%20Estevez">Emilio Estevez</a>'s drama "<a href="The%20Way%20%282010%20film%29">The Way</a>", alongside <a href="Martin%20Sheen">Martin Sheen</a>, <a href="Deborah%20Kara%20Unger">Deborah Kara Unger</a>, and <a href="Yorick%20van%20Wageningen">Yorick van Wageningen</a>, and has a role as Sicinius in <a href="Ralph%20Fiennes">Ralph Fiennes</a>' contemporary Shakespeare adaptation "<a href="Coriolanus%20%282011%20film%29">Coriolanus</a>".

Alongside many other British and Irish actors, Nesbitt was cast in <a href="Peter%20Jackson">Peter Jackson</a>'s three-part film "<a href="The%20Hobbit%20%28film%20series%29">The Hobbit</a>", as the dwarf <a href="List%20of%20Middle-earth%20Dwarves%23Bofur">Bofur</a>. Filming commenced in March 2011. The first part, "", was released in December 2012, the second part, "", in December 2013, and the third and final part, "", in December 2014.

In 2002, Nesbitt made his documentary debut as the presenter of "James Nesbitt's Blazing Saddles", a production for <a href="BBC%20Choice">BBC Choice</a> that saw him spend two weeks in <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a> at the <a href="National%20Finals%20Rodeo">National Finals Rodeo</a> and the Miss Rodeo America pageant. In 2007, he was the guest host of an episode of the late-night <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> comedy "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Night%20Project">The Friday Night Project</a>". As a film awards presenter, he hosted the IFTA Awards ceremony for three consecutive years between 2005 and 2007, the <a href="British%20Independent%20Film%20Awards">British Independent Film Awards</a> from 2005 to 2010, and the <a href="National%20Movie%20Awards">National Movie Awards</a> in 2008 and 2010. In 2009, he hosted the <a href="Laurence%20Olivier%20Award">Laurence Olivier Award</a>s.

An amateur golfer since his teenage years, Nesbitt joined the European team for Sky One's "<a href="All%2AStar%20Cup">All*Star Cup</a>" in 2005 and 2006. He signed up to a series of high-profile television advertisements for the <a href="Yell%20Group">Yell Group</a> in 2003, playing a hapless character called James for the company's <a href="Yellow%20Pages">Yellow Pages</a> campaign until 2006. "Times" writer Andrew Billen noted that the adverts "cost him some credibility" but Nesbitt was pleased with the money he made from them. In 2004, he joined the <a href="Supergroup%20%28music%29">supergroup</a> Twisted X to produce "Born in England", an unofficial anthem for the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national football team</a>'s entry in the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202004">UEFA Euro 2004</a> tournament. His vocals have also appeared in "Lucky Break" and an episode of "Cold Feet". The song he performed in the latter—"<a href="%28Love%20Is%29%20The%20Tender%20Trap">(Love Is) The Tender Trap</a>"—was released on one of the series' soundtrack albums. He also contributed vocals to the "Waking Ned" soundtrack. A fan of Northern Irish band <a href="Ash%20%28band%29">Ash</a>, he made a cameo in their unreleased film "<a href="Slashed">Slashed</a>". In 2009, he starred in the music video for "<a href="The%20Day%20I%20Died">The Day I Died</a>", a single by English dance-pop artist <a href="Just%20Jack">Just Jack</a>. Nesbitt was recommended to Just Jack by <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>. Nesbitt hosted the <a href="British%20Independent%20Film%20Awards%202013">2013 British Independent Film Awards</a> in London on 8 December 2013.

Since 2013, Nesbitt appears in adverts for <a href="Thomas%20Cook%20Group">Thomas Cook</a>.

In 2014, Nesbitt had the lead role as the father character Tony Hughes in harrowing <a href="BBC">BBC</a> drama series "<a href="The%20Missing%20%28TV%20series%29">The Missing</a>", alongside <a href="Frances%20O%27Connor">Frances O'Connor</a> (as his wife/ex-wife, Emily Hughes/Walsh) and <a href="Tch%C3%A9ky%20Karyo">Tchéky Karyo</a> (as Julien Baptiste, leading French police investigator). The drama focused on a British married couple, whose son goes missing while they are on holiday in France, and the subsequent years of enquiry trying to find answers as to what happened to their son and why. Incidentally, Nesbitt and Karyo had appeared previously together in the <a href="Martin%20Sheen">Martin Sheen</a> film "<a href="The%20Way%20%282010%20film%29">The Way</a>" (2010).

Nesbitt married Sonia Forbes-Adam, the daughter of the Reverend Sir <a href="Adam%20Baronets">Timothy Forbes Adam</a>. The two met when Nesbitt went to the final call-back for "Hamlet" at Loughborough Hall in 1989, and they soon began dating. They split up for a year after the release of "Hear My Song" but reunited and married in 1994. They have since had two daughters, Peggy and Mary (both of whom appeared in the final two Hobbit movies as the daughters of Bard the Bowman). In October 2013, Nesbitt announced that he and Forbes-Adam would separate from each other after 19 years.

Nesbitt is a patron of Wave, a charity set up to support those traumatised by <a href="the%20Troubles">the Troubles</a>. The charity faced closure due to funding problems before Nesbitt encouraged celebrities and artists to become involved. Since 2005, he has been a <a href="UNICEF%20UK">UNICEF UK</a> ambassador, working with HIV and AIDS sufferers, and former child soldiers in Africa. He describes the role as "a privilege." Writing in "The Independent" about his visit to <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a> in 2006, Nesbitt concluded that the children he met were owed a social and moral responsibility. The article was described in the "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>" as "moving and notably well-crafted." Since 1999, he has been a patron of Action Cancer, a result of both his father's affliction with prostate cancer and a storyline in the second series of "Cold Feet", where his character suffered testicular cancer. He has been an honorary patron of Youth Lyric, one of Ireland's largest theatre schools, since 2007.

He is a fan of football teams <a href="Coleraine%20F.C.">Coleraine</a> and most passionately <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> and also supports the Northern Irish national team. In 2003, Nesbitt made a donation of "thousands of pounds" to Coleraine, after the team came close to bankruptcy. He has called the team "a heartbeat" of Coleraine and encouraged more people to watch <a href="IFA%20Premiership">Irish League</a> football. Nesbitt was a vocal opponent of <a href="Malcolm%20Glazer">Malcolm Glazer</a>'s 2005 <a href="Glazer%20ownership%20of%20Manchester%20United">takeover of Manchester United</a>, though after the completion of that deal he acted in television advertisements promoting executive boxes at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>, for which he was criticised by fans. To counter the criticism, he pledged one half of his £10,000 fee to the <a href="Manchester%20United%20Supporters%27%20Trust">Manchester United Supporters' Trust</a> and the other half to UNICEF.

In March 2010, Nesbitt accepted the ceremonial position of <a href="Chancellor%20%28education%29">Chancellor</a> of the University of Ulster, succeeding former <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a> Sir Richard Nichols. Gerry Mallon, then-chair of the university ruling council, expected Nesbitt to "bring considerable energy, dynamism and commitment" to the post. Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to an awful lot of people and places because of my work. I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at <a href="Stormont%20Estate">Stormont</a>, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. I believe I can bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on."

He was appointed <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE) in the <a href="2016%20New%20Year%20Honours">2016 New Year Honours</a> for services to drama and to the community in Northern Ireland.

Kevin Beattie

Thomas Kevin Beattie (18 December 1953 – 16 September 2018) was an English <a href="Association%20football">footballer</a>. Born into poverty, he played at both professional and international levels, mostly as a <a href="Association%20football%20positions%23Centre-back">centre-half</a>. He spent the majority of his playing career at <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>, with whom he won both the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> and the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>. He was also named the inaugural <a href="PFA%20Young%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Professional Footballers' Association Young Player of the Year</a> at the end of the 1972–73 season and featured in the film "<a href="Escape%20to%20Victory">Escape to Victory</a>" alongside many of his Ipswich teammates.

Beattie's playing career took him from <a href="rags%20to%20riches">rags to riches</a>, but according to "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" he was "cursed by being both injury and accident prone". His playing career included some controversy, notably when he went missing when selected for <a href="England%20national%20under-23%20football%20team">England's under-23 team</a>. After retiring from playing, he descended into unemployment, alcohol abuse and contemplated suicide before finding purpose once more and a new career in later life, as a football <a href="Sports%20commentator">commentator</a> on television and radio.

Beattie has been called Ipswich Town's best ever player by many pundits and polls. Former Ipswich (and later <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a>) manager <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a> called him the best England player he had seen.

Thomas Kevin Beattie was born in <a href="Carlisle">Carlisle</a> on 18 December 1953. His family lived in the <a href="Botcherby">Botcherby</a> estate and he was one of nine children: five boys and four girls. He became known by his middle name, as his father was also named Thomas Beattie. Beattie's mother was a cleaner at a <a href="Lipton">Lipton</a> tea shop, whilst his father worked for the <a href="National%20Coal%20Board">National Coal Board</a>, delivering coal. Thomas played amateur football as a <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> and once had a trial with <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, but turned down an offer to join the club as he could earn more working for the Coal Board. After he was forced to give up work due to a back problem, the family suffered financially and were often short of food, leading to the young Beattie taking fruit and vegetables from local <a href="Allotment%20%28gardening%29">allotments</a>. In later life, he recalled, "There was often only food on the table when Dad had backed a winning horse, or else won a game of darts, or dominoes down at his local pub."

Beattie supported his local football team, Carlisle United, and idolised players like <a href="Hughie%20McIlmoyle">Hughie McIlmoyle</a>. He recalled being "devastated" when McIlmoyle was too busy to sign an autograph outside the club, resolving never to turn down such requests. Beattie attended St Cuthbert's Roman Catholic junior school, where he began playing football for the school team, initially as a goalkeeper. His family were unable to afford the football boots he needed, but a teacher named Mr Raffety bought a pair for him. Beattie soon became a <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">forward</a> and modelled himself on <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea's</a> <a href="Peter%20Osgood">Peter Osgood</a>.

Although Beattie passed his <a href="eleven-plus">eleven-plus</a> exams, his family could not afford the <a href="grammar%20school">grammar school</a> uniform, so he moved to St Patrick's Roman Catholic senior school. He began playing for Blackfriars, a local youth team managed by Raffety, and also, from the age of 14, for a pub team, alongside his father. Raffety recommended him to Carlisle United, but the club did not have a youth team. Beattie was also told that <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> had shown an interest in him, but had been wrongly told that he was not a Catholic, the traditional religion of the majority of the club's fanbase. He left school at 14 and subsequently worked as a machine fitter and delivery boy in factories, a warehouse, a dry cleaner and then a furniture company.

Aged 15, Beattie was playing for Blackfriars on Sunday and for a club called St Augustine on Saturdays, when he was spotted by a <a href="Scout%20%28association%20football%29">football scout</a> and offered a trial with <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Beattie travelled to Liverpool and impressed manager <a href="Bill%20Shankly">Bill Shankly</a> sufficiently for him to be invited back to sign for the club. Beattie returned to Liverpool on his own, but nobody from the club arrived to meet him at <a href="Liverpool%20Lime%20Street%20railway%20station">Lime Street station</a>. After waiting an hour and assuming they had lost interest, and with nothing but his boots and train ticket, he returned home to Carlisle. Shankly would later describe missing out on signing the youngster as one of his biggest mistakes.

Soon after this, Beattie joined <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> as an <a href="Glossary%20of%20association%20football%20terms">apprentice</a>. Ipswich manager <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a> made sure that he was met at <a href="Euston%20railway%20station">Euston station</a> in London, played in a youth match at <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>, and was accompanied all the way to Ipswich's <a href="Portman%20Road">Portman Road</a> ground by chief scout, <a href="Ron%20Gray%20%28footballer%29">Ron Gray</a>. Robson told Gray, "If you miss him, you've lost your job". The poverty Beattie came from was evident when he arrived in Ipswich wearing his father's shoes, so when Ipswich signed him, they immediately bought him some clothes. As a youth, he played as a <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a>, but Robson converted him into a <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29">defender</a>, usually a <a href="Association%20football%20positions%23Centre-back">centre-half</a>; the player said in later life that the move suited him well, as it meant he could see all the play in front of him.
Now earning a wage, Beattie tried to help support his family, sending money home each week. He also stepped in to prevent domestic violence between his parents: "I became extremely upset when I found out that Dad was spending the money that I had been sending home on drink and Mum was going without. Not only that but I also found out that his drinking had got worse and he had started knocking Mum around."

Beattie was given his first-team debut aged 18 against <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the opening match of the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1972–73 season</a> in <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">England's top division</a>. Ipswich won the game 2–1, and afterwards he asked United's <a href="Bobby%20Charlton">Bobby Charlton</a> for his autograph; Charlton told Beattie that his play reminded him of <a href="Duncan%20Edwards">Duncan Edwards</a> and that, in years to come, he would be the one signing autographs. He scored his first league goal for the club two weeks later at <a href="Elland%20Road">Elland Road</a> in a 3–3 draw with <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>. Beattie featured 38 times for Ipswich in the league that season, and scored 5 goals, as Ipswich ended the season in fourth place, their best finish since the Championship-winning <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">1961–62 season</a> under <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a>. He was also part of the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20Texaco%20Cup">1972–73 Texaco Cup</a>-winning team, won against Norwich City 4–2 on <a href="Playoff%20format%23Total%20points%20series%20%28aggregate%29">aggregate over two legs</a>, and was named the inaugural winner of the <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Ipswich Town Player of the Year</a> award.

The <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">following season</a> saw Beattie's first appearance in a European competition, with Ipswich having qualified for the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> as a result of their fourth position in the league the previous season. He played in aggregate victories over <a href="Real%20Madrid%20CF">Real Madrid</a> (1–0), <a href="S.S.%20Lazio">Lazio</a> (6–4) and <a href="FC%20Twente">FC Twente</a> (3–1), before the side lost on penalties to <a href="1.%20FC%20Lokomotive%20Leipzig">Lokomotive Leipzig</a>, Beattie having scored his first European goal in the home leg. He appeared in all 42 league games for Ipswich that season (along with <a href="Mick%20Mills">Mick Mills</a>), made 15 other appearances in cup competitions, and was presented with the inaugural <a href="Professional%20Footballers%27%20Association">Professional Footballers' Association</a>'s (PFA) <a href="PFA%20Young%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Young Player of the Year award</a>. He was also once again voted his club's Player of the Year. Early in the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1974–75 season</a>, Beattie was involved in mild controversy against <a href="Stoke%20City%20F.C.">Stoke City</a> when his tackle at Portman Road broke <a href="John%20Ritchie%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201941%29">John Ritchie</a>'s leg. In the return fixture at Stoke's <a href="Victoria%20Ground">Victoria Ground</a>, Beattie's teammate <a href="Allan%20Hunter%20%28footballer%29">Allan Hunter</a> was involved in an incident that left Stoke's <a href="Denis%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201947%29">Denis Smith</a> with a broken leg. The crowd erupted in anger, directed at Beattie; Robson noted "There was a cauldron for 20 minutes. Kevin Beattie had to beat 28,000 people out there." Later that season, Beattie was awarded the captaincy for a game, against his home team Carlisle United. Having played 52 games and scored 6 goals during the season for Ipswich, he was elected by his peers as a member of the <a href="PFA%20Team%20of%20the%20Year%20%281970s%29">First Division Team of the Year</a>. He had helped his club reach the semi-final of the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20FA%20Cup">1974–75 FA Cup</a> and to finish the league season in third position.

Beattie made 36 appearances for Ipswich during the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1975–76 season</a>, scoring 4 goals. Ipswich finished sixth and were knocked out of the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20FA%20Cup">1975–76 FA Cup</a> in the fourth round. Towards the end of the season, he began to suffer from severe back pain, something he blamed on an injury incurred as a child while helping his father carry sacks of coal. Despite the relative lack of success with his club, he was selected in the First Division Team of the Year for the second year in a row. The <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Football%20League%20First%20Division">1976–77 season</a> started well for Ipswich with victories over Liverpool and Manchester United. Ipswich then achieved a club record-equalling 7–0 win over <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>: the Albion goalkeeper <a href="John%20Osborne%20%28footballer%29">John Osborne</a> said of Beattie's long-range goal that he regarded himself as fortunate he had not touched it as it would have knocked his hand off. Beattie's season was prematurely curtailed by a self-inflicted injury: stoking a <a href="bonfire">bonfire</a> at his home, he decided to add petrol; the ensuing flare-up gave him serious burns to his face and neck, leading to him missing six matches. Before the injury, Ipswich were challenging for the league title, but, in Beattie's absence, the side lost four of their last six matches and missed out on winning the championship by five points. He played in 34 games for Ipswich that season, scoring 5 goals, and was selected for the PFA Team of the Year for the third time in a row, along with teammates Mick Mills and <a href="Brian%20Talbot">Brian Talbot</a>.

Beattie was fit to play by the start of the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1977–78 season</a>, but a knee injury sustained in a league match led to him withdrawing from the England squad to face <a href="Luxembourg%20national%20football%20team">Luxembourg</a>. Further investigation revealed he had damaged <a href="Meniscus%20%28anatomy%29%23Injury">cartilage</a> in his knee, which required an operation. Having had three weeks' recuperation, and a <a href="cortisone">cortisone</a> injection, he was restored to the Ipswich squad in time to play in the third round <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> home leg against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>. Ipswich won the fixture 3–0, and even though he suffered a reaction in his knee, he insisted he was able to play in the away leg. Robson disagreed and he was left out of the side for the game, and Ipswich were knocked out on penalties. Cortisone injections became commonplace for Beattie, who returned to the team in time for the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> fourth-round victory against <a href="Hartlepool%20United%20F.C.">Hartlepool</a>. Although Ipswich's form in the league was poor, they were safe from <a href="promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a> by the time they faced West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup semi-final at <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Highbury</a>, a game for which Beattie was given the all-clear. A 3–1 victory saw Ipswich into the final, yet the next day his knee was once again swollen and his participation in <a href="1978%20FA%20Cup%20Final">the final</a> was in jeopardy. According to Beattie, "the boss secretly told me that if I felt fit enough to play then I was in". Robson did not announce the Cup final team until the last minute: it included a formation change to include five midfielders and <a href="Paul%20Mariner">Paul Mariner</a> as a lone striker – and Beattie in defence. <a href="Roger%20Osborne">Roger Osborne</a>'s late goal for Ipswich was the only score of the game, and they won the trophy. Beattie had three cortisone injections to get through the final. Following the cup final success, he and teammates <a href="Robin%20Turner">Robin Turner</a> and <a href="David%20Geddis">David Geddis</a> were awarded the <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">freedom</a> of Carlisle. Beattie had represented Ipswich 21 times during the course of the season, without scoring a goal.

Shortly into the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1978–79 season</a>, Beattie suffered problems with his other knee. Two further operations followed, and he was confined to treatment and physiotherapy, only, in his words, "wheeled out for the really big games". Overall, he made 26 appearances that season, scoring twice. The <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1979–80 season</a> saw him make just 12 appearances, twice as substitute, and score twice, as his post-match recuperation took weeks, not days. He also played a "bit-part" in the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">1980–81 season</a>, usually as a striker instead of his usual position of centre-half. However, his defensive role in the two-leg victory over the <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>n team <a href="Bohemians%201905">Bohemians</a>, in the second round of the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20UEFA%20Cup">1980–81 UEFA Cup</a>, for which he was awarded man of the match, proved vital to Ipswich's season. Although irregularly selected as a result of his injuries, Beattie played in the fourth round, first leg 4–1 away victory over <a href="AS%20Saint-%C3%89tienne">AS Saint-Étienne</a>, whose team included <a href="Michel%20Platini">Michel Platini</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Rep">Johnny Rep</a>. Ipswich won the home leg 3–1 without Beattie. He played his last match for Ipswich in April 1981, in an FA Cup semi-final loss to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in which he broke his arm. Ipswich won the <a href="1981%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">UEFA Cup at the end of the season</a>, but Beattie was not presented with a winner's medal as he did not play in the final or even appear on the bench, through injury; 26 years later, a petition was organised by Rob Finch, the writer of Beattie's 2007 biography "The Greatest Footballer England Never Had", calling on UEFA to right the wrong: Beattie was finally awarded a medal by UEFA president <a href="Michel%20Platini">Michel Platini</a> at the <a href="2008%20UEFA%20Cup%20Final">2008 UEFA Cup Final</a> between <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a> and <a href="FC%20Zenit%20Saint%20Petersburg">Zenit Saint Petersburg</a>.

Beattie retired due to injury in December 1981, following five knee operations in four years. His <a href="Testimonial%20match">testimonial game</a> took place in March 1982, against a <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Moscow">Dynamo Moscow</a> XI.

In the <a href="Season%20%28sports%29%23Off-season">off-season</a> of 1982, Beattie began training with <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> under manager <a href="Ken%20Brown%20%28footballer%29">Ken Brown</a> who offered him a short-term contract. The offer was soon withdrawn because Ipswich were reluctant to release Beattie to <a href="Pride%20of%20Anglia">their local rivals</a>. Instead, he joined another <a href="Pride%20of%20Anglia">East Anglian team</a>, <a href="Colchester%20United%20F.C.">Colchester United</a>, whose player-manager was Beattie's former teammate, Allan Hunter. Beattie made six appearances for the club, but when teammate <a href="John%20Lyons%20%28footballer%29">John Lyons</a> committed suicide, Hunter resigned, and Beattie decided to move on. He signed for <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>, where he made five appearances during <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Football%20League%23First%20Division">that season</a>, scoring once, a penalty, in a 2–0 FA Cup victory over <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a>. His time at the club ended when he suffered a serious groin injury, whilst playing against north-east rivals <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a>.

Dropping into <a href="non-League%20football">non-League football</a>, Beattie signed for <a href="Barry%20Fry">Barry Fry</a>'s <a href="Barnet%20F.C.">Barnet</a>, joining another ex-England international, <a href="Steve%20Whitworth">Steve Whitworth</a>. Injury and, according to Beattie, "a combination of the drink and depression" curtailed his spell at the club. After failing to secure any coaching work, Beattie took up work as a labourer, and joined local team <a href="Harwich%20%26amp%3B%20Parkeston%20F.C.">Harwich & Parkeston</a> to supplement his income. Accepting an offer from Ipswich's former scout Ron Gray, Beattie joined Swedish second-tier side <a href="Sandvikens%20IF">Sandvikens IF</a> under manager and former <a href="Sweden%20national%20football%20team">Swedish international</a> player, <a href="Thomas%20Nordahl">Thomas Nordahl</a>. Soon after, Nordahl suddenly resigned and the club let Beattie go. He moved to Norway, signing for fourth division club <a href="Kongsberg%20IF">Kongsberg IF</a>, where he scored more than 60 goals in his first season. He signed for Norwegian second division club <a href="Nybergsund%20IL-Trysil">Nybergsund IL-Trysil</a> in 1988, making five appearances for them before moving back to England. He also played for <a href="F.C.%20Clacton">Clacton Town</a>. He assisted <a href="Mike%20Walker%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Mike Walker</a> and <a href="Duncan%20Forbes%20%28footballer%29">Duncan Forbes</a> at Norwich City as a <a href="Scout%20%28sport%29">scout</a> during Walker's time as manager and performed a similar role for <a href="Alan%20Ball%20Jr.">Alan Ball Jr.</a> at <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a>. Beattie's first foray into coaching was a part-time position at his hometown club <a href="Carlisle%20United%20F.C.">Carlisle</a> under <a href="Roddy%20Collins">Roddy Collins</a> in the 2002–03 season. Collins was sacked early in the 2003–04 season, and Beattie left the club, subsequently opting to coach school children in the United States. His last coaching position was a short spell with Barry Fry at <a href="Peterborough%20United%20F.C.">Peterborough United</a>.

Former Ipswich manager and then-<a href="England%20national%20football%20team%20manager">England manager</a> <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a> selected Beattie to represent the <a href="England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">England under-23 team</a> during the 1972–73 English domestic season. He made his debut in November 1972 against <a href="Wales%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Wales under-23s</a> at <a href="Vetch%20Field">Vetch Field</a> in Swansea, winning 3–0. His final game also saw his only goal at that level, in a 2–0 victory, once again over Wales, this time at the <a href="Racecourse%20Ground">Racecourse Ground</a> in Wrexham.

Beattie's senior England debut came under <a href="Don%20Revie">Don Revie</a>, a starting role in a 5–0 victory over <a href="Cyprus%20national%20football%20team">Cyprus</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a> in April 1975, especially notable for <a href="Malcolm%20Macdonald">Malcolm Macdonald</a> scoring all five goals. Beattie managed to put the ball in the net, but the goal was disallowed for a foul on the goalkeeper; ultimately, the only goal he scored for his country was in May 1975, during a 5–1 victory over <a href="Scotland%20national%20football%20team">Scotland</a> in the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20British%20Home%20Championship">1974–75 British Home Championship</a>. <a href="Perry%20Groves">Perry Groves</a>, who played alongside Beattie at Colchester United, describes how Beattie, ostensibly playing at left-back, emerged to meet a cross from <a href="Kevin%20Keegan">Kevin Keegan</a>, beat two Scottish defenders and "looped a great header" into the goal, voted one of the top 50 goals England have scored. His final game for England was in October 1977 against <a href="Luxembourg%20national%20football%20team">Luxembourg</a> in a qualification match for the <a href="1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1978 FIFA World Cup</a>. In total, he earned nine <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a> between 1975 and 1977, scoring once.

Beattie was renowned for his strength, the nickname "Beast" reflecting that, but also his quality on the ball (with the resultant other nickname of "Diamond"). Robson described him as "the quickest defender I ever saw ... with a left foot like a howitzer". Perry Groves noted that Beattie's only shortcoming appeared to be his inability to throw the ball far. When Beattie arrived at Colchester, "into his thirties" and with his knees "all shot", "he was still the quickest player at the club over ten yards by a long way." Groves recalls Robson's summary of Beattie's strengths as a player:
What a player the boy was... He could climb higher than the crossbar and still head the ball down. He had the sweetest left foot I've ever seen and could hit 60-yard passes, without looking, that eliminated six opposition players from the game. He had the strength of a tank, was lightning quick and he could tackle.

During his years with Ipswich, Beattie formed a central defensive partnership with Allan Hunter. Robson described them as 'Bacon and eggs'. Interviewed in 2018, Hunter talked about their partnership:

we just gelled and if I went and done things to attack the ball he was always behind me – and vice-versa. We didn't need to work at it because it was something that came naturally ... We were just a good partnership ... me and Beat would be sitting on the other side of a room from each other and we would know what the other was thinking because there were times I would, or he would, burst out laughing and the boys would say, what you bloody laughing at? And we would say "mind your own business" ... It helped on the field because we didn’t even have to talk because we knew each other’s play.

In December 1974, Beattie was involved in an incident that prompted newspaper headlines across the quality and <a href="tabloid%20press">tabloid press</a>. Called up to represent England at under-23 level against <a href="Scotland%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Scotland under-23s</a> at <a href="Pittodrie%20Stadium">Pittodrie</a>, Beattie was "put on the right train by his manager Bobby Robson", yet failed to arrive in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. That Beattie was "found" playing <a href="dominoes">dominoes</a> with his father in a pub in Carlisle gave legs to the story, although England manager Don Revie sent Beattie a telegram wishing him a happy birthday, the following day. Groves' account, 30 years later, is that when Beattie's train pulled into <a href="Carlisle%20railway%20station">Carlisle station</a>, he saw the name, felt homesick and went to visit his father. Media coverage at the time ascribed Beattie's lapses to pressure, factors cited including his then four-week-old daughter, his rags-to-riches climb and a virus. Subsequent reports that he then missed training for Ipswich, allegedly preferring to stay in bed when passed fit by the club doctor, fuelled the story further. Ipswich suspended him for one match.

Beattie accepted a lit cigarette from a fan and smoked it while collecting his <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final%201978">FA Cup winner's medal in 1978</a>. According to Groves, Beattie smoked 20 cigarettes a day for the duration of his playing career; he also missed part of pre-season for Colchester because he "strained too much" while defecating, resulting in a pulled stomach muscle.

Beattie was unemployed on several occasions after finishing his playing career. Groves writes about how the unemployment office where Beattie would sign on was so close to Ipswich's home ground that he would see players arriving in their "flash motors", while he signed autographs. After running a <a href="pub">pub</a>, he began drinking very heavily and was on one occasion given the <a href="last%20rites">last rites</a> when his <a href="pancreas">pancreas</a> "packed up". He considered suicide, but was able to care for his wife who was seriously unwell, and, according to Groves, managed to get "his life back on the right track". Nonetheless, Beattie became impoverished, and despite receiving £50,000 from a <a href="testimonial%20match">testimonial match</a> organised by Ipswich Town, he depended on financial help from the <a href="Professional%20Footballers%27%20Association">Professional Footballers' Association</a>. In later years, Beattie worked for broadcast media: he commented on football for <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Suffolk">BBC Radio Suffolk</a> until the day before his death. He also co-wrote his autobiography, "The Beat", published in 1998. In May 2012, Beattie was convicted of <a href="benefit%20fraud">benefit fraud</a> and given a 12-week curfew. He had failed to disclose his earnings from radio, for fear of losing <a href="Income%20Support">Income Support</a>. He later apologised and described it as a "silly mistake".

Beattie met his future wife Margaret Boldy, known as Maggie, in the late-1960s/early-1970s in a youth club near to his apprentice accommodation, Beattie describing it as "love at first sight". They were married in 1974, and soon after she appeared in the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" in a "Footballers' Wives" feature; at that point the couple were still living in a "modest" club-owned house. During the mid-1980s, Maggie was diagnosed with <a href="multiple%20sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a> and later confined to a wheelchair, with Beattie as her carer in their council-owned bungalow. They had three daughters, Emma, Sarah and Louise.

His playing career injuries gave Beattie difficulties in later life: by the time he was 53 he was "unable to walk more than half a mile", due to the <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a> in his knees. He refused to bow to his difficulties: "Maggie, bless her, never complains", he said to a "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>" reporter, "so why should I feel any anger at how life turned out?". On 16 September 2018, Beattie died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 64. He was survived by his wife and daughters. His funeral was held at the crematorium at <a href="Nacton">Nacton</a> on 26 October 2018. Former Ipswich and England player <a href="Terry%20Butcher">Terry Butcher</a> paid tribute to Beattie, calling him "the complete footballer" and describing his left-footed shot as an "<a href="Exocet">Exocet</a>". <a href="George%20Burley">George Burley</a> referred to Beattie as "a legend", while <a href="John%20Wark">John Wark</a>, whose nickname for Beattie was "Monster", described him as the best-ever Ipswich player.

Beattie was once described by Bobby Robson as the best England player he had seen, and that he could have rivalled Duncan Edwards. Beattie was inducted into the <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Ipswich Town Hall of Fame</a> in 2008, was voted numerous times as Ipswich Town's "best ever player", and features as one of Perry Groves' 20 "Football Heroes" in a book published in 2009.

Along with some of his Ipswich teammates, Beattie featured in the 1981 film "<a href="Escape%20to%20Victory">Escape to Victory</a>". His skills were shown on the pitch as the <a href="body%20double">body double</a> for <a href="Michael%20Caine">Michael Caine</a>'s prisoner-of-war character, and the two became friends. Beattie had a cooler relationship with <a href="Sylvester%20Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a>, who also starred in the film: "There weren't too many that got on that well with him and after I beat him in an arm wrestle — first my right arm and then my left – he didn't speak to me again". A campaign for a permanent memorial to Beattie to be placed outside Portman Road, along with the existing statues of Robson and Alf Ramsey, was started soon after his death by "<a href="Ipswich%20Star">Ipswich Star</a>" and "<a href="East%20Anglian%20Daily%20Times">East Anglian Daily Times</a>" editor Brad Jones.

Runaway Scrape

The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>, from the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Alamo">Battle of the Alamo</a> through the decisive <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</a>. The "<a href="ad%20interim">ad interim</a>" government of the new <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> abrogated the 1824 constitution of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and established <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> in <a href="Coahuila%20y%20Tejas">Coahuila y Tejas</a>. The <a href="Texians">Texians</a> resisted and declared their independence. It was <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a>'s responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the <a href="Texian%20Army">Provisional Army of Texas</a> (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna.

Residents on the Gulf Coast and at <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio de Béxar</a> began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the <a href="Goliad%20massacre">Goliad massacre</a> instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of <a href="Gonzales%2C%20Texas">Gonzales</a>, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the "ad interim" government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28Texas%29">Colorado River</a> and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's force.

The towns of Gonzales and <a href="San%20Felipe%20de%20Austin%2C%20Texas">San Felipe de Austin</a> were burned to keep them out of the hands of the Mexican army. Santa Anna was intent on executing members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from <a href="Washington-on-the-Brazos%2C%20Texas">Washington-on-the-Brazos</a> to Groce's Landing to <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Houston">Harrisburg</a> and <a href="Morgan%27s%20Point%2C%20Texas">New Washington</a>. The government officials eventually escaped to <a href="Galveston%20Island">Galveston Island</a>, and Santa Anna burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from the Mexican army. After a little over a month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage the Mexican army. The subsequent Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the surrender of Santa Anna and the signing of the <a href="Treaties%20of%20Velasco">Treaties of Velasco</a>.

In 1834, Mexican president <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> shifted from a Federalist political ideology to creating a Centralist government and revoked the country's <a href="1824%20Constitution%20of%20Mexico">Constitution of 1824</a>. That constitution had not only established <a href="Coahuila%20y%20Tejas">Coahuila y Tejas</a> as a new Mexican state, but had also provided for each state in Mexico to create its own local-level constitution. After eliminating state-level governments Santa Anna had in effect created a dictatorship and put Coahuila y Tejas under the military rule of General <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20Perfecto%20de%20Cos">Martín Perfecto de Cos</a>. When Santa Anna made <a href="Miguel%20Barrag%C3%A1n">Miguel Barragán</a> temporary president, he also had Barragán install him as head of the Mexican Army of Operations. Intending to put down all rebellion in Coahuila y Tejas, he began amassing his army on November 28, 1835, soon followed by General <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20y%20Sesma">Joaquín Ramírez y Sesma</a> leading the Vanguard of the Advance across the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a> in December.

<a href="Stephen%20F.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a> was commander of the existing unpaid volunteer <a href="Texian">Texian</a> army, and at his urging the <a href="Consultation%20%28Texas%29">Consultation of 1835</a> convened in <a href="San%20Felipe%20de%20Austin%2C%20Texas">San Felipe de Austin</a> on November 3 of that year. Their creation of a provisional government based on the 1824 constitution established the General Council as a legislative body with each municipality allotted one representative. <a href="Henry%20Smith%20%28Texas%20governor%29">Henry Smith</a> was elected governor without any clearly defined powers of the position. <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> was in attendance as the elected representative from <a href="Nacogdoches%2C%20Texas">Nacogdoches</a>, and also served as commander of the Nacogdoches militia. <a href="Edward%20Burleson">Edward Burleson</a> replaced Austin as commander of the volunteer army on December 1.

On December 10, the General Council called new elections to choose delegates to determine the fate of the region. The Consultation approved the creation of the Provisional Army of Texas, a paid force of 2,500 troops. Houston was named commander-in-chief of the new army and issued a recruitment Proclamation on December 12.
The volunteer army under Burleson disbanded on December 20. 

<a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Texas">Harrisburg</a> was designated the seat of a deeply divided provisional government on December 30. Most of the General Council wanted to remain part of Mexico, but with the restoration of the 1824 constitution. Governor Smith supported the opposing faction who advocated for complete independence. Smith dissolved the General Council on January 10, 1836, but it was unclear if he had the power to do that. He was impeached on January 11. The power struggle effectively shut down the government.

The <a href="Convention%20of%201836">Convention of 1836</a> met at <a href="Washington-on-the-Brazos%2C%20Texas">Washington-on-the-Brazos</a> on March 1. The following day, the 59 delegates created the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> by affixing their signatures to the <a href="Texas%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Texas Declaration of Independence</a>. Houston's military authority was expanded on March 4, to include "the land forces of the Texian army both Regular, Volunteer, and Militia." The delegates elected the Republic's "<a href="ad%20interim">ad interim</a>" government on March 16, with <a href="David%20G.%20Burnet">David G. Burnet</a> as president, <a href="Lorenzo%20de%20Zavala">Lorenzo de Zavala</a> as vice president, <a href="Samuel%20P.%20Carson">Samuel P. Carson</a> as secretary of state, <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson%20Rusk">Thomas Jefferson Rusk</a> as secretary of war, <a href="Bailey%20Hardeman">Bailey Hardeman</a> as secretary of the treasury, <a href="Robert%20Potter%20%28U.S.%20politician%29">Robert Potter</a> as secretary of the navy, and <a href="David%20Thomas%20%28Texas%20politician%29">David Thomas</a> as attorney general.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20Gonzales">Battle of Gonzales</a> was the onset of a chain of events that led to what is known as the Runaway Scrape. The confrontation began in September 1835, when the Mexican government attempted to reclaim a bronze cannon that it had provided to <a href="Gonzales%2C%20Texas">Gonzales</a> in 1831 to protect the town against Indian attacks. The first attempt by Corporal Casimiro De León resulted in De León's detachment being taken prisoners, and the cannon being buried in a peach orchard. <a href="James%20C.%20Neill">James C. Neill</a>, a veteran who had served at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Horseshoe%20Bend%20%281814%29">Battle of Horseshoe Bend</a> under <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, was put in charge of the artillery after it was later dug up and wheel mounted. When Lieutenant <a href="Francisco%20de%20Casta%C3%B1eda">Francisco de Castañeda</a> arrived accompanied by 100 soldiers and made a second attempt at repossessing the cannon, Texians dared the Mexicans to "come and take it". <a href="John%20Henry%20Moore%20%28Texas%29">John Henry Moore</a> led 150 Texian militia on October 2 in successfully repelling the Mexican troops. A "Come and Take It" flag was later fashioned by the women of Gonzales. The cannon was moved to <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio de Béxar</a> and became one of the artillery pieces used by the defenders of the Alamo.

The immediate result of the Texian victory at Gonzales was that two days later the number of volunteers had swelled to over 300, and they were determined to drive the Mexican army out of Texas. Simultaneously, a <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> of volunteers under George M. Collinsworth captured the Presidio La Bahía from the Mexicans on October 9 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Goliad">Battle of Goliad</a>. The Mexican government's response to the unrest in Texas was an October 30 authorization of war. On the banks of the Nueces River from San Patricio on November 4 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lipantitl%C3%A1n">Battle of Lipantitlán</a>, volunteers under <a href="Ira%20Westover">Ira Westover</a> captured the fort from Mexican troops.

By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under <a href="James%20Bowie">James Bowie</a> and <a href="James%20Fannin">James Fannin</a> to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at <a href="Mission%20Concepci%C3%B3n">Mission Concepción</a> on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under <a href="Domingo%20Ugartechea">Domingo Ugartechea</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Concepci%C3%B3n">battle</a>. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the <a href="Grass%20Fight">Grass Fight</a>, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join <a href="Branch%20T.%20Archer">Branch T. Archer</a> and <a href="William%20H.%20Wharton">William H. Wharton</a> on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while <a href="Benjamin%20Milam">Benjamin Milam</a> and <a href="Frank%20W.%20Johnson">Frank W. Johnson</a> led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the <a href="Siege%20of%20B%C3%A9xar">Siege of Béxar</a> continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.

Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and <a href="James%20Grant%20%28Texas%29">James Grant</a> on the <a href="Matamoros%20Expedition">Matamoros Expedition</a>, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Urrea">José de Urrea</a> on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About north of Matamoros at <a href="San%20Patricio%2C%20Texas">San Patricio</a>, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Patricio">Battle of San Patricio</a>. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition led by Grant, killing all but 11, six of whom were taken prisoner. Five of the men escaped the <a href="Battle%20of%20Agua%20Dulce">Battle of Agua Dulce</a> and joined Fannin who wanted to increase the defense force at Goliad.

Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Alamo">Alamo mission</a> and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel <a href="William%20B.%20Travis">William B. Travis</a> arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain <a href="Juan%20Segu%C3%ADn">Juan Seguín</a> left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' <a href="To%20the%20People%20of%20Texas%20%26amp%3B%20All%20Americans%20in%20the%20World">February 24 letter To the People of Texas</a>, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.

As the closest settlement to San Antonio de Béxar, Gonzales was the rallying point for volunteers who responded to both the Travis letter from the Alamo and Houston's recruitment pleas. Recently formed groups came from Austin and Washington counties and from the Colorado River area. Volunteers from <a href="Brazoria%20County%2C%20Texas">Brazoria</a>, <a href="Fort%20Bend%20County%2C%20Texas">Fort Bend</a> and <a href="Matagorda%20County%2C%20Texas">Matagorda</a> counties organized after arriving in Gonzales. The Kentucky Rifle company under <a href="Newport%2C%20Kentucky">Newport, Kentucky</a> business man <a href="Sidney%20Sherman">Sidney Sherman</a> had been aided by funding from <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> residents.

Alamo commandant Neill was in Gonzales purchasing supplies and recruiting reinforcements on March 6. When Seguin learned en route that Fannin would be unable to reach the Alamo in time, he immediately began mustering an all-<a href="Tejano">Tejano</a> company of scouts. His men combined with Lieutenant William Smith's and volunteered to accompany Neill's recruits. They encountered the Mexican army from the Alamo on March 7, and Neill's men turned back while the Seguin-Smith scouts moved forward. As the scouts neared the Alamo, they met only silence. Andrew Barcena and Anselmo Bergara from Seguin's other detachment inside the Alamo showed up in Gonzales on March 11, telling of their escape and delivering news of the slaughter. Their stories were discounted; Houston, who had arrived that same day, denounced them as Mexican spies.

Smith and Seguin confirmed the fate of the mission upon their return. Houston dispatched orders to Fannin to abandon Goliad, blow up the <a href="Presidio%20La%20Bah%C3%ADa">Presidio La Bahía</a> fortress, and retreat to <a href="Victoria%2C%20Texas">Victoria</a>, but Fannin delayed acting on those orders. Believing the approach of Urrea's troops brought a greater urgency to local civilians, he sent 29 men under Captain Amon B. King to help evacuate nearby <a href="Refugio%2C%20Texas">Refugio</a>.

Houston promptly began organizing the troops at Gonzales into the First Regiment under Burleson who had arrived as part of the <a href="Bastrop%2C%20Texas">Mina</a> volunteers. A second regiment would later be formed when the army grew large enough. As others began to arrive, individual volunteers not already in another company were put under Captain William Hestor Patton. Houston had 374 volunteers and their commanders in Gonzales on March 12.

Santa Anna sent <a href="Susanna%20Dickinson">Susanna Dickinson</a> with her infant daughter Angelina, Travis' slave Joe, and Mexican Colonel <a href="Juan%20Almonte">Juan Almonte</a>'s cook Ben to Gonzales, with dispatches written in English by Almonte to spread the news of the fall of the Alamo. Scouts <a href="Deaf%20Smith">Deaf Smith</a>, <a href="Henry%20Karnes">Henry Karnes</a> and Robert Eden Handy encountered the survivors outside of Gonzales on March 13. When Karnes returned with the news, almost immediately 25 volunteers deserted. Wailing filled the air when Dickinson and the others reached the town with their first-hand accounts.

Although civilian evacuations had begun in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to a safe place to train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position – the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.

Houston called for a Council of War. The officers voted that the families should be ordered to leave, and the troops would cover the retreat. By midnight, less than an hour after Dickinson had arrived, the combined army and civilian population began a frantic move eastward, leaving behind everything they could not immediately grab and transport. Much of the provisions and artillery were left behind, including two 24-pounder cannons. Houston ordered <a href="Salvador%20Flores">Salvador Flores</a> along with a company of Juan Seguin's men to form the rear guard to protect the fleeing families. Couriers were sent to other towns in Texas to warn that the Mexican army was advancing.

The retreat took place so quickly that many of the Texian scouts did not fully comprehend it until after the town was evacuated. Houston ordered Karnes to burn the town and everything in it so nothing would remain to benefit the Mexican troops. By dawn, the entire town was in ashes or flames.

Volunteers from San Felipe de Austin who had been organized under Captain John Bird on March 5 to reinforce the men at the Alamo had been en route to San Antonio de Béxar on March 13 when approximately east of Gonzales they encountered fleeing citizens and a courier from Sam Houston. Told of the Alamo's fall, Bird's men offered assistance to the fleeing citizens and joined Houston's army at Bartholomew D. McClure's plantation on the evening of March 14.

At Washington-on-the-Brazos, the delegates to the convention learned of the Alamo's fall on March 13. The Republic's new "ad interim" government was sworn in on March 17, with a department overseeing military spy operations, and adjourned the same day. The government then fled to Groce's Landing where they stayed for several days before moving on to Harrisburg on March 21 where they established temporary headquarters in the home of widow Jane Birdsall Harris.

King's men at Refugio had taken refuge in Mission Nuestra Señora de la Rosario when they were subsequently attacked by Urrea's forces. Fannin sent 120 reinforcements under <a href="William%20Ward%20%28Texas%29">William Ward</a>, but the March 14 <a href="Battle%20of%20Refugio">Battle of Refugio</a> cost 15 Texian lives. Ward's men escaped, but King's men were captured and executed on March 16.

Upon learning of the flight, Santa Anna sent General Joaquín Ramírez y Sesma with 700 men to pursue Houston, and 600 men under General Eugenio Tolsa as reinforcements. Finding only burned remains at Gonzales, Sesma marched his army toward the <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28Texas%29">Colorado River</a>.

The Texian army camped March 15–18 on the <a href="Lavaca%20River">Lavaca River</a> property of Williamson Daniels where they were joined by combined forces under Joe Bennett and Captain Peyton R. Splane. Fleeing civilians accompanied Houston's army turning north at the <a href="Navidad%20River">Navidad River</a> as they crossed to the east side of the Colorado River at Burnam's Crossing. The ferry and trading post, as well as the family home of Jesse Burnam, were all burned at Houston's orders on March 17 to prevent Santa Anna's army from making the same crossing.

Beason's Crossing was located where <a href="Columbus%2C%20Texas">Columbus</a> is today. DeWees Crossing was north of Beason's. From March 19 through March 26, Houston split his forces between the two crossings. Additional Texian volunteer companies began arriving at both crossings, including three companies of <a href="Texas%20Ranger%20Division">Texas Rangers</a>, the Liberty County Volunteers and the Nacogdoches Volunteers.

Sesma's <a href="battalion">battalion</a> of approximately 725 men and artillery camped on the opposite side of the Colorado, at a distance halfway between the two Texian camps. To prevent Sesma's troops from using the William DeWees log cabin, Sherman ordered it burned. Three Mexican scouts from Sesma's army were captured by Sherman's men, and although Sherman argued for an attack on Sesma's troops, Houston was not ready.

Fannin had begun evacuating Presidio La Bahía on March 19. The estimated 320 troops were low on food and water, and the breakdown of a wagon allowed Urrea's men to overtake them at <a href="Battle%20of%20Coleto">Coleto Creek</a>, ending in Fannin's surrender on March 20. <a href="Peter%20Kerr%20%28Texas%20settler%29">Peter Kerr</a>, who had served with Fannin and claimed to have been held prisoner, arrived at DeWees on March 25. Houston announced Fannin's surrender, but would later claim to have uncovered evidence that Kerr was a spy for the Mexicans.

The Texian army was a force of 810 volunteers and staff at this point, but few had any military training and experience. Faced with past desertions, discipline flaws, and individual indecisiveness of volunteers in training, Houston knew they were not yet ready to engage the Mexican army. Compounding the situation were the civilian refugees dependent upon the army for their protection. The news of Fannin's capture, combined with his doubts about the readiness of the Texian army, led Houston to order a retreat on March 26. Some of the troops viewed the decision as cowardice with Sesma sitting just on the other side of the Colorado, and several hundred men deserted.

Texian survivors of the Battle of Coleto Creek believed their surrender agreement with Urrea would, at worst, mean their deportation. Santa Anna, however, adhered to the 1835 <a href="Tornel%20Decree">Tornel Decree</a> that stated the insurrection was an act of piracy fomented by the United States, and ordered their executions. Although he personally disagreed with the need to do so, Urrea carried out his commander's orders on March 27. Of the estimated 370 Texians being held, a few managed to escape the massacre. The remainder were shot, stabbed with bayonets and lances and clubbed with gun butts. Fannin was shot through the face and his gold watch stolen. The dead were cremated on a <a href="pyre">pyre</a>.

It would be a week before word of the <a href="Goliad%20massacre">Goliad massacre</a> reached Sam Houston. The retreating Texian army stopped at San Felipe de Austin on March 28–29 to stock up on food and supplies. Houston's plan to move the army north to Groce's Landing on the Brazos River was met with resistance from captains Wyly Martin and Moseley Baker, whose units balked at further retreat. Houston reassigned Martin south to protect the Morton Ferry crossing at Fort Bend, and Baker was ordered to guard the river crossing at San Felipe de Austin.

News of approaching Mexican troops and Houston's retreat caused panic among the population in the counties of Washington, <a href="Sabine%20County%2C%20Texas">Sabine</a>, <a href="Shelby%20County%2C%20Texas">Shelby</a> and <a href="San%20Augustine%20County%2C%20Texas">San Augustine</a>. Amid the confusion of fleeing residents of those counties, two volunteer groups under captains William Kimbro and Benjamin Bryant arrived to join Houston on March 29. Kimbro was ordered to San Felipe de Austin to reinforce Baker's troops, while Bryant's men remained with the main army.

After an erroneous scouting report of approaching Mexican troops, Baker burned San Felipe de Austin to the ground on March 30. When Baker claimed Houston had given him an order to do so, Houston denied it. Houston's account was that the residents burned their own property to keep it out of the hands of the Mexican army. San Felipe de Austin's residents did as those before them in escaping the Mexican army, and fled to the east.

During a two-week period beginning March 31, the Texian army camped on the west side of the <a href="Brazos%20River">Brazos River</a> in <a href="Austin%20County%2C%20Texas">Austin County</a>, near Groce's Landing (also known as Groce's Ferry). As Houston led his army north towards the landing, the unrelenting rainy weather swelled the Brazos and threatened flooding. Groce's was transformed into a training camp for the troops. Major Edwin Morehouse arrived with a New York battalion of recruits who were immediately assigned to assist Wyly Martin at Fort Bend. Civilian men who were fleeing the Mexicans enlisted at Groce's, 
and displaced civilian women in the camp helped the army's efforts by sewing shirts for the soldiers.

Samuel G. Hardaway, a survivor of Major William Ward's group who had escaped the Battle of Refugio and re-joined Fannin at the Battle of Coleto, also managed to escape the Goliad massacre. As he fled Goliad, he was eventually joined by three other survivors, Joseph Andrews, James P. Trezevant and M. K. Moses. Spies for the Texian army discovered the four men and took them to Baker's camp near San Felipe de Austin on April 2. Several other survivors of the Goliad massacre were found on April 10 by Texian spies. Survivors Daniel Murphy, Thomas Kemp, Charles Shain, David Jones, William Brenan and Nat Hazen were taken to Houston at Groce's Landing where they enlisted to fight with Houston's army.

Houston learned of the Goliad massacre on April 3. Unaware that Secretary of War Rusk was already en route to Groce's with orders from President Burnet to halt the army's retreat and engage the enemy, he relayed the Goliad news by letter to Rusk.

Empowered to remove Houston from command and take over the army himself, Rusk instead assessed Houston's plan of action as correct, after witnessing the training at Groce's. Rusk and Houston formed the Second Regiment on April 8 to serve under Sherman, with Burleson retaining command of the First Regiment.

The steamboat "<a href="Yellowstone%20%28steamboat%29">Yellowstone</a>" under the command of Captain John Eautaw Ross was impressed into service for the Provisional Army of Texas on April 2, and initially ferried patients across the Brazos River when Dr. James Aeneas Phelps established a field hospital at Bernardo Plantation. Three days later, Santa Anna joined with Sesma's troops, and had them build flatboats to cross the Brazos as the Mexicans sought to overtake and defeat the Texians. Wyly Martin reported on April 8 that Mexican forces had divided and were headed both east to Nacogdoches and southeast to Matagorda. Houston reinforced Baker's post at San Felipe de Austin on April 9, as Santa Anna continued moving southeast on April 10.

The Texian army was transported by the "Yellowstone" over to the east side of the Brazos on April 12, where they set up camp at the Bernardo Plantation. After walking from Harrisburg, future president of the Republic <a href="Mirabeau%20B.%20Lamar">Mirabeau B. Lamar</a> arrived at Bernardo to enlist as a private in Houston's army and suggested using the steamer for guerilla warfare.

With Baker guarding the crossing at San Felipe de Austin, and Martin guarding the Morton Ferry crossing at Ford Bend, Santa Anna opted on April 12 to cross the Brazos halfway between at Thompson's Ferry, with Sesma's men and artillery crossing over the next day. The Mexican army attacked the steamer numerous times in an attempt to capture it, but Ross successfully used cotton bales to protect the steamer and its cargo, and was able to keep the "Yellowstone" away from Mexican control. Houston released the steamboat from service on April 14, and it continued to Galveston.

The "ad interim" government departed Harrisburg on the steamboat "Cayuga" for <a href="Morgan%27s%20Point%2C%20Texas">New Washington</a> ahead of Santa Anna's April 15 arrival, thwarting his plans to eliminate the entire government of the Republic of Texas. Three printers still at work on the "<a href="Telegraph%20and%20Texas%20Register">Telegraph and Texas Register</a>" told the Mexican army that everyone in the government had already left, and Santa Anna responded by having the printers arrested and the printing presses tossed into <a href="Buffalo%20Bayou">Buffalo Bayou</a>. After days of looting and seeking out information about the government, Santa Anna ordered the town burned on April 18. He later tried to place the blame for the destruction on Houston.
Before the Texian army left Bernardo Plantation, they welcomed the arrival of two cannons cast in November 1835 by Greenwood and Webb in <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, funded entirely by the people of that city as a donation to the Texas Revolution. The idea had arisen as a suggestion from Robert F. Lytle, one of the businessmen who helped fund Sherman's Kentucky Riflemen. Arriving in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> after a lengthy trip from Ohio on the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>, the cannons were transported to the <a href="Gulf%20Coast%20of%20Texas">Gulf Coast</a> aboard the "Pennsylvania" schooner. The cannons were nicknamed the "Twin Sisters", perhaps in honor of the twins Elizabeth and Eleanor Rice traveling aboard the "Pennsylvania", who were to present the cannons upon their arrival at Galveston in April 1836. At Galveston, Leander Smith had the responsibility of transporting the cannons from Harrisburg to Bernardo Plantation in Waller County. Along the way, Smith recruited 35 men into the army. Lieutenant Colonel James Neill was put in charge of the cannons once they arrived in camp.

Martin and Baker abandoned the river crossings on April 14 and re-joined Houston's army which had marched from Bernardo to the Charles Donoho Plantation near present-day <a href="Hempstead%2C%20Texas">Hempstead</a> in Waller County. As news spread of the Mexican army's movements, residents of Nacogdoches and <a href="San%20Augustine%2C%20Texas">San Augustine</a> began to flee east towards the Sabine River. After refusals to continue with the army, Martin was ordered by Houston to accompany displaced families on their flight eastward. Hundreds of soldiers left the army to help their families. The main army parted from the refugees at this point, and acting Secretary of War David Thomas advised Houston to move southward to secure Galveston Bay. Houston, however, was getting conflicting advice from the cabinet members. President Burnet had sent Secretary of State Carson to Louisiana in hopes of getting the United States army and individual state militias involved in the Texas fight for independence. While he attempted to secure such involvement, Carson sent a dispatch to Houston on April 14 advising him to retreat all the way to the Louisiana-Texas border on the Sabine River, and bide his time before engaging the Mexican army.

The Texian army camped west of present-day <a href="Tomball%2C%20Texas">Tomball</a> on April 15, at Sam McCarley's homestead. They departed the next morning and east reached a crucial crossroads. One road led east to Nacogdoches and eventually the Sabine River and Louisiana, while the other road led southeast to Harrisburg. The army was concerned that Houston would continue the eastward retreat. Although Houston discussed his decision with no one, he led the army down the southeast road. Rusk ordered that a small group of volunteers be split from the army to secure Robbins's Ferry on the Trinity River. Houston's troops stopped overnight on April 16 at the home of Matthew Burnet, and the next morning continued marching towards Harrisburg, southeast.

With the refugee families being accorded a military escort eastward and Houston marching southeast, the retreat of the Provisional Army of Texas was over. On the march which would lead to San Jacinto, moving the heavy artillery across rain-soaked terrain slowed down the army's progress. The army had previously been assisted in moving the Twin Sisters with oxen borrowed from refugee Pamela Martin when she believed the army was fleeing towards Nacogdoches. When she learned the army was headed towards Harrisburg and a confrontation with the Mexican army, she reclaimed her oxen. The Texian army had expanded to twenty-six companies by the time they reached Harrisburg on April 18 and saw the destruction Santa Anna had left behind.

On orders of Santa Anna after the burning of Harrisburg, Almonte went in pursuit of the "ad interim" government at New Washington. During their flight the Republic officials switched from steamer to ferry to skiff. On the final leg of the trip, Almonte finally had them in his sights, but refused to fire after he saw Mrs. Burnet and her children on the skiff. In addition to letting the government get away one more time, Almonte's spies had misread Houston's troop movements and Santa Anna was told that the Texian army was still retreating eastward, this time through <a href="Lynchburg%2C%20Texas">Lynchburg</a>.

New Washington was looted and burned on April 20 by Mexican troops, and as many as 5,000 civilians fled, either by boat or across land. Those attempting to cross the <a href="San%20Jacinto%20River%20%28Texas%29">San Jacinto River</a> were bottlenecked for three days, and the vicinity around the crossing transformed into a refugee camp. Burnet ordered government assistance all across Texas for fleeing families.

In a troop movement that took all night on a makeshift raft, the Texian army crossed Buffalo Bayou at Lynchburg April 19 with 930 soldiers, leaving behind 255 others as guards or for reasons of illness. The idea had been floated of leaving the Twin Sisters behind as protection, but Neill was adamant that the cannons be taken into the battle. In an April 20 skirmish the day before the main battle Neill was severely wounded, and <a href="George%20Washington%20Hockley">George Hockley</a> took command of the heavy artillery. Estimates of the Mexican army troop strength on the day of the main battle range from 1,250 to 1,500.

The Texians attacked in the afternoon of April 21 while Santa Anna was still under the misconception that Houston was actually retreating. He had allowed his army time to relax and feed their horses, while he took a nap. When he was awakened by the attack, he immediately fled on horseback, but was later captured when Sergeant <a href="James%20Austin%20Sylvester">James Austin Sylvester</a> found him hiding in the grass. Houston's own account was that the battle lasted "about eighteen minutes", before apprehending prisoners and confiscating armaments. When the Twin Sisters went up against the Mexican army's Golden Standard cannon, they performed so well that Hockley's unit was able to capture the Mexican cannon.

The "Yellowstone" saw war service for the Republic one more time on May 7, when it transported Houston and his prisoner Santa Anna, along with the government Santa Anna tried to extinguish, to <a href="Galveston%20Island">Galveston Island</a>. From there, the government and Santa Anna traveled to <a href="Velasco%2C%20Texas">Velasco</a> for the signing of the <a href="Treaties%20of%20Velasco">treaties</a>. Houston had suffered a serious wound during the battle, and on May 28 boarded the schooner "Flora" for medical treatment in New Orleans.

Not until news of the victory at San Jacinto spread did the refugees return to their homesteads and businesses, or whatever was left after the destruction caused by both armies. Throughout Texas, possessions had been abandoned and later looted. Businesses, homes and farms were wiped out by the devastation of war. Often there was nothing left to go back to, but those who went home began to pick up their lives and move forward. San Felipe de Austin never really recovered from its total destruction. The few people who returned there moved elsewhere, sooner or later. Secretary of War Rusk would later commend the women of Texas who held their families together during the flight, while their men volunteered to fight: "The men of Texas deserve much credit, but more was due the women. Armed men facing a foe could not but be brave; but the women, with their little children around them, without means of defense or power to resist, faced danger and death with unflinching courage."

Battle of Groix

The Battle of Groix was a large naval engagement which took place near the island of <a href="Groix">Groix</a> off the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Biscay</a> coast of <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> on 23 June 1795 (<a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Calendar">5 messidor an III</a>) during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>. The battle was fought between elements of the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> and the French Atlantic Fleet, which were cruising in the region on separate missions. The British fleet, commanded by Admiral <a href="Alexander%20Hood%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Bridport">Lord Bridport</a>, was covering an <a href="Invasion%20of%20France%20%281795%29">invasion convoy</a> carrying a <a href="%C3%89migr%C3%A9%20armies%20of%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Royalist</a> army to invade <a href="Quiberon">Quiberon</a>, while the French under Vice-amiral <a href="Villaret%20de%20Joyeuse">Villaret de Joyeuse</a> had sailed a week earlier to rescue a French convoy from attack by a British squadron. The French fleet had driven off the British squadron in a battle on 17 June known as <a href="Cornwallis%27s%20Retreat">Cornwallis's Retreat</a>, and were attempting to return to their base at <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> when Bridport's force of 14 <a href="ships%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> appeared on 22 June.

Villaret, believing that the stronger British fleet would destroy his own 12 ships of the line, ordered his force to fall back to the inshore anchorage off Groix, hoping to take shelter in protected coastal waters. Several of his ships were too slow, falling behind so that early in the morning of 23 June the rearmost ships of his fleet were caught by the British vanguard, overhauled one by one and brought to battle. Although Villaret fought a determined rearguard action, three French ships were captured, all with very heavy casualties, and the remainder of the French fleet was left scattered across miles of coastline. In this position they were highly vulnerable to continued British attack, but after only a few hours' engagement, concerned that his ships might be wrecked on the rocky coastline, Bridport called off the action and allowed Villaret to regroup inshore and retreat to <a href="Lorient">Lorient</a>.

Although the battle was a British victory, there was criticism of Bridport's rapid withdrawal. British historians have subsequently considered that a unique opportunity to destroy the French Atlantic fleet had been lost. The invasion at Quiberon ended in disaster a month later, although Bridport remained at sea in the region until September. The French fleet by contrast was trapped in the port of Lorient where food supplies ran out, forcing Villaret to discharge many of his ships' crews. As a result, most ships did not return to Brest until the winter and were consequently unable to threaten British control of the French coastline for the remainder of the year. Several French captains were court-martialled following the battle, with two dismissed from the Navy for disobeying orders.

The first two years of the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a> had seen the French Atlantic Fleet, based principally at the <a href="Brittany">Breton</a> harbour of <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>, suffer a series of setbacks. The tense atmosphere in France following the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> was reflected in the fleet, which suffered a mutiny in September 1793 followed by <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">a purge</a> of suspected anti-republicans which resulted in the death or imprisonment of a number of experienced commanders. In <a href="Atlantic%20campaign%20of%20May%201794">May 1794</a>, the French fleet sallied into the Atlantic to protect an incoming grain convoy from the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and was attacked by the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> at the battle of the <a href="Glorious%20First%20of%20June">Glorious First of June</a>, losing seven ships, although the convoy was saved. In the winter of 1794–1795, five more French ships were lost in a disastrous sortie in the middle of the Atlantic winter storm season known as the "<a href="Croisi%C3%A8re%20du%20Grand%20Hiver">Croisière du Grand Hiver</a>". By the spring of 1795, the British Channel Fleet was in the ascendancy, enforcing a distant <a href="blockade">blockade</a> of the French fleet in Brest.

In May 1795, with much of the winter's damage repaired, the French commander <a href="Vice-amiral">Vice-amiral</a> <a href="Villaret%20de%20Joyeuse">Villaret de Joyeuse</a> sent a squadron of three <a href="ships%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> and several <a href="frigates">frigates</a> under <a href="Contre-amiral">Contre-amiral</a> <a href="Jean%20Gaspard%20Vence">Jean Gaspard Vence</a> to <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> with orders to escort a convoy of merchant ships carrying wine and brandy to Brest. On 8 June, as Vence's convoy passed the fortified island of <a href="Belle%20%C3%8Ele">Belle Île</a> on the southern Breton coast they were discovered by a British battle squadron of five ships of the line and two frigates under Vice-Admiral <a href="William%20Cornwallis">William Cornwallis</a>. Vence ordered his outnumbered ships to shelter under the batteries of Belle Île, and after a brief skirmish Cornwallis withdrew his forces with eight captured merchant ships. While Cornwallis was escorting his prizes to the mouth of the Channel, Vence sailed out of the Belle Île anchorage and discovered on 15 June that the main force of the Atlantic fleet had sailed to rescue him, a mission ordered by government over the objections of the fleet's officers that Vence would be able to easily extricate himself from the anchorage due to the proximity of the port of <a href="Lorient">Lorient</a>.

On the morning of 16 June Cornwallis returned to the region, hunting for Vence, and instead discovered Villaret de Joyeuse with an overwhelming force. This time Cornwallis was forced to retreat, heading into open water with the French fleet in pursuit. Cornwallis was hampered by the poor sailing of two of his squadron, and on the morning of 17 June the leading French ships were close enough to open fire on his rearguard. Throughout the day the French vanguard kept up a distant but continual fire on the rearmost British ship <a href="HMS%20Mars%20%281794%29">HMS "Mars"</a>, until eventually the ship began to fall behind. In an effort to protect "Mars", Cornwallis interposed his 100-gun flagship <a href="HMS%20Royal%20Sovereign%20%281786%29">HMS "Royal Sovereign"</a> between the British squadron and the French force, its massive broadsides driving the French back. At the same time, Cornwallis had ordered the frigate <a href="HMS%20Phaeton%20%281782%29">HMS "Phaeton"</a> to range ahead of his squadron making false signals announcing the imminent arrival of a British fleet. These signals, in combination with the coincidental appearance of unidentified sails to the north, caused Villaret to become so concerned that at 18:40 he called off pursuit and returned to the French coast, allowing Cornwallis to return to Britain without further incident. The engagement was subsequently known as <a href="Cornwallis%27s%20Retreat">Cornwallis's Retreat</a>.

Unbeknownst to either Villaret or Cornwallis, the British Channel Fleet was also at sea, having sailed from <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> on 12 June with 14 ships of the line and 11 smaller vessels under the command of Admiral <a href="Alexander%20Hood%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Bridport">Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport</a>. Bridport had been tasked with ensuring the safety of a convoy of transports, commanded by Commodore <a href="Sir%20John%20Borlase%20Warren">Sir John Borlase Warren</a>, which carried a <a href="%C3%89migr%C3%A9%20armies%20of%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Royalist</a> army to <a href="Quiberon">Quiberon</a> with the intention of triggering a counter-revolution in Brittany. This force consisted of an additional three ships of the line, six frigates and more than 50 transports containing 2,500 French Royalists. The voyage across the English Channel and around the <a href="Ushant">Ushant</a> headland took seven days, the combined fleet and expeditionary force arriving off Belle Île on 19 June. Bridport had ordered Warren to take his convoy on to Quiberon while the main body of the Channel Fleet stood further out to sea to intercept any attack by the French Atlantic Fleet, which Bridport assumed would advance southwards from Brest. What the British admiral did not know was that not only had the French fleet sailed a week earlier, but that they were still at sea – Villaret's ships having been blown southwards by a severe gale on 18 June and forced to take shelter in the anchorage off Belle Île.

It was one of Warren's ships, the frigate <a href="HMS%20Arethusa%20%281793%29">HMS "Arethusa"</a>, which first discovered the French as Villaret led his fleet out from the sheltered anchorage. Lookouts on "Arethusa" miscounted the French fleet, identifying 16 ships of the line and ten frigates; Warren immediately sent word to Bridport while ordering his convoy to turn away from the French. Villaret did not pursue Warren's force: he may not have gauged its true strength correctly, and his ships were running low on provisions having only taken enough aboard for 15 days at sea in their haste to leave Brest a week earlier. On the morning of 20 June, Warren's force sighted Bridport's fleet to the south-east, the admiral sending orders to Warren to detach his three ships of the line to bolster Bridport's fleet in the face of the supposedly more numerous French force. Without waiting for these reinforcements, Bridport sailed back towards the coast against the wind, seeking to place his fleet between the Quiberon expedition and Villaret's ships.

The adverse southeasterly winds frustrated both fleets, and it was not until 03:30 on 22 June that lookouts on Bridport's scouting frigates <a href="HMS%20Nymphe%20%281780%29">HMS "Nymphe"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Astrea%20%281781%29">HMS "Astrea"</a> finally discovered the French in the distance to the southeast, the British approximately from the French coast. On seeing the larger British fleet, to which Warren's detached ships had still not joined, Villaret ordered his fleet to turn back towards the land and Bridport followed, seeing that the French admiral did not intend to offer battle. To maximise his chances of catching the French, Bridport specifically ordered his "best-sailing" ships <a href="HMS%20Sans%20Pareil%20%281794%29">HMS "Sans Pareil"</a>, <a href="HMS%20Orion%20%281787%29">HMS "Orion"</a>, <a href="HMS%20Colossus%20%281787%29">HMS "Colossus"</a>, <a href="HMS%20Irresistible%20%281782%29">HMS "Irresistible"</a>, <a href="HMS%20Valiant%20%281759%29">HMS "Valiant"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Russell%20%281764%29">HMS "Russell"</a>, to break from the formation and lead the pursuit at 06:30. Bridport followed in his 100-gun <a href="first%20rate">first rate</a> flagship <a href="HMS%20Royal%20George%20%281788%29">HMS "Royal George"</a>, accompanied by the remainder of the fleet, which included another 100-gun ship <a href="HMS%20Queen%20Charlotte%20%281790%29">HMS "Queen Charlotte"</a> and seven 98-gun <a href="second%20rate">second rate</a> ships.

All day the chase continued: at 12:00 the French fleet were approximately distant, and all through the afternoon the British ships slowly gained on their opponents, both sides hampered by long periods of calm weather. To ensure that his fleet was in a position to intercept the French whichever <a href="tacking%20%28sailing%29">tack</a> they took, Bridport split his fleet across a wide front, clustered in two trailing groups. At 19:00, Bridport signaled for his ships to attack the rearmost French vessels, and at 19:25 to attack French ships as and when they overhauled them, taking up mutually supportive positions. At 22:30 a calm fell, arresting both fleets until 03:00 on 23 June, when a light breeze from the south-west was enough to allow Bridport's fleet to push onwards so that as dawn rose the French were dead ahead. The main body of the French fleet was sailing in a loose cluster with three or four ships trailing behind and one ship, <a href="HMS%20Alexander%20%281778%29">"Alexandre"</a> under Captain <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Charles%20Guillemet">François Charles Guillemet</a> far to the rear and only from the British vanguard. "Alexandre" had been a British ship until November 1794, when she had been captured in a <a href="Action%20of%206%20November%201794">sharp engagement</a> with a French squadron in which the ship had been badly damaged. The ship was a poor sailer, and its position was worsened by poor handling by Guillemet who did not follow Villaret's orders to form a <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a> rapidly enough.

Against expectation, Bridport's leading ship was "Queen Charlotte", which had attained an unusually fast speed for a first rate through the carefully planned sailing of Captain <a href="Sir%20Andrew%20Snape%20Douglas">Sir Andrew Snape Douglas</a>. Immediately behind Douglas was Captain <a href="Richard%20Grindall">Richard Grindall</a> in "Irresistible", with "Orion", "Colossus", "Sans Pareil" and "Russell" a short distance behind the leaders and the rest of the fleet substantially to the rear. At 04:00, the island of Groix lay approximately to the east of "Queen Charlotte", the French coastline behind it. It was to this region that Villaret was retreating, hoping that Bridport would be reluctant to follow him into the confined waters around the well-fortified island, which lies on the entrance to the port of Lorient. The southern Breton coast was a notoriously dangerous region, where Atlantic gales could push ships towards poorly charted reefs and rocky outcrops.

With "Alexandre" now in danger of becoming isolated, Villaret sent the frigate <a href="French%20frigate%20R%C3%A9g%C3%A9n%C3%A9r%C3%A9e%20%281794%29">"Régénérée"</a> to take the lumbering vessel under tow at 05:00. Just under an hour later, Douglas brought "Queen Charlotte" within range, Guillemet firing his <a href="Chase%20gun">stern-chasers</a> at his three-decked opponent. Douglas responded with his bow-chasers, gradually bringing his main battery into range and joined by Captain <a href="Sir%20James%20Saumarez">Sir James Saumarez</a> in "Orion", which opened fire shortly after 06:00. The frigate captain, aware that his ship was powerless against two such opponents, abandoned the tow and sped ahead to rejoin the French fleet. Villaret's force had once more divided, with <a href="HMS%20Belleisle%20%281795%29">"Formidable"</a> under Captain <a href="Charles%20Linois">Charles Linois</a> a little way ahead of "Alexandre" and Villaret in his 120-gun flagship <a href="French%20ship%20Oc%C3%A9an%20%281790%29">"Peuple"</a> ahead of "Formidable". With the French admiral were <a href="French%20ship%20Redoutable%20%281791%29">"Redoutable"</a>, <a href="French%20ship%20Orion%20%281787%29">"Mucius"</a>, <a href="French%20ship%20Wattignies%20%281794%29">"Wattignies"</a>, <a href="French%20ship%20Tigre%20%281793%29">"Tigre"</a> and Vence's flagship <a href="French%20ship%20Nestor%20%281793%29">"Nestor"</a>, while the remainder of the fleet had pushed on ahead and were now substantially advanced. Villaret sent signals to form a tight line of battle, and all French ships repeated the signal, but none executed the manoeuvre.

At 06:15, "Queen Charlotte" passed "Alexandre" and began firing on "Formidable", Linois returning fire against his much larger enemy for fifteen minutes before a fire broke out on the <a href="poop%20deck">poop deck</a>. As the French crew scrambled to extinguish it, "Sans Pareil", flagship of Rear-Admiral <a href="Lord%20Hugh%20Seymour">Lord Hugh Seymour</a>, reached the ship and fired a broadside in passing, causing "Formidable" to lose speed and fall further back from the main body of the French. The fire from "Queen Charlotte" had reduced Linois's ship to a wreck, with the rigging torn and more than 320 men killed or wounded from a crew of 717. As "Sans Pareil" passed ahead of the battered ship, the mizzenmast on "Formidable" collapsed over the side and Linois, seeing the rest of the British fleet rapidly approaching, <a href="striking%20the%20colours">struck his colours</a> and surrendered. As "Sans Pareil" and "Queen Charlotte" battled "Formidable", "Colossus" and "Russell", joined by the second rates <a href="HMS%20London%20%281766%29">HMS "London"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Queen%20%281769%29">HMS "Queen"</a>, pushed on to the French centre where Villaret's ships were awaiting them, the French admiral repeatedly attempting to form his ships into a line of battle to receive the British attack, without success.

At 07:00, four British ships and six French fought a confused melee while the French vanguard continued eastwards without pause and the slower portions of the British fleet struggled to come up in the light winds. The entire combat was slowly pulling closer to the fortified rocky island of Groix, close to which Villaret intended to shelter his fleet. Douglas in "Queen Charlotte" had been forced out of the engagement due to severe damage to his rigging and sails which made his ship unmanageable. At 07:14, he drifted past the shattered hull of "Alexandre"; Captain Guillemet opened fire briefly before surrendering as Douglas returned it with devastating effect. Even as his ship fell back, Douglas continued to engage the French at long range, turning the guns on "Peuple" and "Tigre", joined by "Sans Pareil" which attacked "Tigre" under Captain <a href="Jacques%20Bedout">Jacques Bedout</a> and forced it out of the French formation with severe damage. Villaret again attempted to gather his forces in support of "Tigre", and even positioned his frigate ahead of his own fleeing ships in hope of cutting off their retreat and forcing them to imitate his own manoeuvres, but in vain; "they would have passed over my very body had not taken command and prevented a collision", he wrote in his report. As "Tigre" fell out of line, "Queen" and "London" joined the attack on the isolated ship, and Bedout was forced to surrender in the face of overwhelming odds. The French ship had been severely damaged, with of water in the hold, the masts and rigging badly torn and more than 130 men killed or wounded, including Bedout, who had been hit three times.

At 07:57, Bridport's "Royal George" reached the combat, Douglas falling in behind his ship in anticipation of a renewed attack, the crew of "Queen Charlotte" having conducted enough hasty repairs to regain control of their ship. At 08:15 Bridport signaled "Colossus" under Captain <a href="John%20Monkton">John Monkton</a>, the leading British ship more than ahead of the flagship, to return to the fleet. He repeated the order to Seymour in "Sans Pareil" who was almost as far advanced in combat with the retreating "Peuple", on which Villaret's flag captain <a href="Jacques%20Angot">Jacques Angot</a> had been killed in action. Bridport then pulled ahead in the pursuit, catching the badly damaged "Peuple" approximately west of Groix and firing one broadside at the French flagship and another at "Tigre", which Bridport was not aware had already surrendered. At 08:37, ignoring the nearby "Peuple" and the remainder of the French fleet scattered between Groix and the <a href="River%20La%C3%AFta">River Laïta</a>, Bridport turned away to the south-west followed by the British fleet.

Bridport gave instructions as he withdrew for "Alexandre", "Formidable" and "Tigre" to be taken under tow by <a href="HMS%20Prince%20%281788%29">HMS "Prince"</a>, <a href="HMS%20Barfleur%20%281768%29">HMS "Barfleur"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Prince%20George%20%281772%29">HMS "Prince George"</a> respectively. The British fleet was in good condition: five ships had seen no action at all and of those that had fought, only "Queen Charlotte" had suffered any significant damage, principally to her rigging. The British fleet had lost 31 men killed and 113 wounded; "Queen Charlotte" and "Colossus" had the heaviest casualties of 36 and 35 respectively. Bridport placed prize crews on the captured vessels and sent them back to Britain while turning the fleet back eastwards once it had reached a safe distance from the coast, in order to provide support for Warren's expedition to Quiberon. Warren landed the French Royalist forces at <a href="Carnac">Carnac</a> on 27 June, but the invasion ended in disaster a month later, the surviving Royalists driven back to the coast and collected by Warren. Bridport had remained off Quiberon to ensure that Villaret did not return to harass the expeditionary force, returning to Britain on 20 September but leaving the bulk of the blockade fleet off the Breton coast under Rear-Admiral <a href="Henry%20Harvey">Henry Harvey</a>. The 68-year-old Bridport was forcibly retired in October after an unrelated argument with <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> <a href="George%20Spencer%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Spencer">Earl Spencer</a>, but was reinstated in 1796 and continued to serve in command of the Channel Fleet until 1800.

Villaret meanwhile gathered his scattered ships and called a council of his senior officers on the frigate <a href="HMS%20Amelia%20%281796%29">"Prosperine"</a> to discuss their next course of action. The French admiral believed that Bridport had only temporarily withdrawn and would be soon returning to continue the engagement. He therefore proposed to anchor off the Breton coast in a strong defensive position and await Bridport's attack. This scheme was vociferously opposed by Contre-amirals <a href="Yves-Joseph%20de%20Kerguelen%20de%20Tr%C3%A9marec">Kerguelen</a> and <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Eustache%20Bruix">Étienne Eustache Bruix</a> who argued that in such a position the British would be able to use the <a href="weather%20gage">weather gage</a> to bombard the French at will and attack them with <a href="fireships">fireships</a>. Following their advice, Villaret decided to shelter the fleet in the nearby port of Lorient to seek supplies and repairs before returning to Brest. But he found that, having sailed without sufficient provisions, Lorient was not equipped for a fleet of such size and Villaret was forced to discharge the majority of sailors as he was unable to feed them. It was not until December and the winter storm season that a number of the ships were able to travel quietly up the coast to Brest, while others were sent southwards to <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</a>. French casualties had been heavy, although they have not been reported other than on the captured vessels, which totaled 670 killed and wounded. In the aftermath of the action, Villaret wrote a letter condemning the behaviour of a number of his officers, stating ""Soit ignorance, soit ineptie, soit insubordination, malgré nos signaux réitérés, des ordres transmis par porte-voix, rien ne fut fait. Nos boulets atterissaient dans l'eau, le patriotisme à lui seul ne peut manoeuvrer un navire"" ("Be it ignorance, ineptitude or insubordination, in spite of our repeated signals, nothing was done. Our shots landed in water, patriotism alone cannot manoeuvre a ship"). Several French captains were <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>led: <a href="Jean-Charles-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Aved-Magnac">Jean Magnac</a> of <a href="French%20ship%20Z%C3%A9l%C3%A9%20%281764%29">"Zélé"</a>, already blamed for the failure at Cornwallis's Retreat, was dismissed from the Navy, as was Captain Giot-Labrière of <a href="French%20ship%20Fougueux%20%281785%29">"Fougueux"</a>. Captain Larréguy of "Mucius" was censured for not adequately supporting "Tigre", and three other captains were tried but acquitted.

In common with the battle of the Glorious First of June the previous year, rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail, the only officer commended being Bridport's own flag captain <a href="William%20Domett">William Domett</a>, whose ship had only joined the action in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Parliament of Great Britain</a>, which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral <a href="Alan%20Gardner%2C%201st%20Baron%20Gardner">Sir Alan Gardner</a> of "Queen". This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral <a href="John%20Colpoys">John Colpoys</a> of "London", whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's. Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, <a href="William%20James%20%28naval%20historian%29">William James</a> noting that Douglas and "Queen Charlotte" were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral <a href="Sir%20Roger%20Curtis">Sir Roger Curtis</a>, was ashore at the court-martial of Captain <a href="Anthony%20James%20Pye%20Molloy">Anthony Molloy</a> and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet.

All three captured ships were taken into the Royal Navy. The name of "Alexandre" reverted to the former "Alexander", and although James suggests that the ship was never again fit for frontline service, this claim is refuted by "Alexander"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s presence in the line at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile">Battle of the Nile</a> in 1798 under Captain <a href="Alexander%20Ball">Alexander Ball</a>. "Tigre" retained her French name, while "Formidable", as there was already a ship of that name in the Royal Navy, became HMS "Belleisle", apparently due to confusion between the islands of Groix and Belle Île in the aftermath of the battle. "Belleisle" had a long and successful career, fighting at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a> in 1805 under Captain <a href="William%20Hargood">William Hargood</a>.

More controversial than the distribution of commendations was the debate over Bridport's decision to withdraw from the battle while the remainder of the French fleet was still within reach. In his official dispatch, the British admiral wrote that "If the Enemy had not been protected and sheltered by the Land, I have every reason to believe that a much greater Number, if not all the Line of Battle ships, would have been taken or destroyed", going on note that "When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to some Batteries [on Groix], and in the Face of a strong Naval Port [Lorient]. His subsequent concern for the Quiberon expeditionary convoy also demonstrates that he considered its protection his principal duty. But in the opinion of French admiral Kerguelen, ""S'ils avaient bien manouevré, ils auraient pu, ou prendre tous nos vaisseaux, ou les faire périr à la côte"" (If [the English] had manoeuvred successfully they could have taken all of our vessels, or made them perish on the coast). Historians have considered this view and most agree that Bridport's retirement was premature: In 1827 James noted that the scattered remains of the French fleet could easily have been attacked by the unengaged British rear with the advantage of the weather gage, while <a href="William%20Laird%20Clowes">William Laird Clowes</a> wrote in 1901 that "We may be pretty sure that had a <a href="Horatio%20Nelson">Nelson</a>, a <a href="Edward%20Hawke">Hawke</a> or even a <a href="Edward%20Boscawen">Boscawen</a> commanded on the occasion, the fleet of Villaret would have been annihilated." Twenty-first-century historians Noel Mostert and <a href="Richard%20Woodman">Richard Woodman</a> have compared Groix with the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Genoa">Genoa</a> and <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Hy%C3%A8res%20Islands">Hyères</a> fought during in the year in the Mediterranean, where in similar circumstances another elderly admiral, <a href="William%20Hotham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hotham">William Hotham</a>, had also allowed scattered and retreating French fleets to escape when they might have been destroyed.

James Garrard

James Garrard (January 14, 1749 – January 19, 1822) was a farmer and <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> minister who served as the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">second</a> <a href="governor%20of%20Kentucky">governor of Kentucky</a> from 1796 to 1804. Because of <a href="Term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">term limits</a> imposed by the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">state constitution</a> adopted in 1799, he was the last Kentucky governor elected to two consecutive terms until the restriction was eased by a 1992 amendment, allowing <a href="Paul%20E.%20Patton">Paul E. Patton</a>'s re-election in 1999.

After serving in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a>, Garrard moved west to the part of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> that is now <a href="Bourbon%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Bourbon County, Kentucky</a>. He held several local political offices and represented the area in the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a>. He was chosen as a delegate to five of the ten statehood conventions that secured <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>'s separation from Virginia and helped write the state's first constitution. Garrard was among the delegates who unsuccessfully tried to exclude guarantees of the continuance of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> from the document. In 1795, he sought to succeed <a href="Isaac%20Shelby">Isaac Shelby</a> as governor. In a three-way race, <a href="Benjamin%20Logan">Benjamin Logan</a> received a <a href="plurality%20%28voting%29">plurality</a>, but not a <a href="majority">majority</a>, of the electoral votes cast. Although the state constitution did not specify whether a plurality or a majority was required, the electors held another vote between the top two candidates – Logan and Garrard – and on this vote, Garrard received a majority. Logan protested Garrard's election to <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">state attorney general</a> <a href="John%20Breckinridge%20%28Virginia%20and%20Kentucky%29">John Breckinridge</a> and the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">state senate</a>, but both claimed they had no constitutional power to intervene.

A <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republican</a>, Garrard opposed the <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a> and favored passage of the <a href="Kentucky%20Resolutions">Kentucky Resolutions</a>. He lobbied for public education, militia and prison reforms, business subsidies, and legislation favorable to the state's large debtor class. In 1798, the state's <a href="Old%20Governor%27s%20Mansion%20%28Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky%29">first governor's mansion</a> was constructed, and Garrard became its first resident. Due in part to the confusion resulting from the 1795 election, he favored calling a constitutional convention in 1799. Because of his anti-slavery views, he was not chosen as a delegate to the convention. Under the resulting constitution, the governor was <a href="Direct%20election">popularly elected</a> and was forbidden from succeeding himself in office, although Garrard was personally exempted from this provision and was re-elected in 1799. During his second term, he applauded <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s purchase of <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">Louisiana</a> from France as a means of dealing with the closure of the port at <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans</a> to U.S. goods. Late in his term, his <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Secretary of State</a>, <a href="Harry%20Toulmin%20%28Unitarian%20minister%29">Harry Toulmin</a>, persuaded him to adopt some doctrines of <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarianism</a>, and he was expelled from the Baptist church, ending his ministry. He also clashed with the legislature over the appointment of a registrar for the state land office, leaving him embittered and unwilling to continue in politics after the conclusion of his term. He retired to his estate, Mount Lebanon, and engaged in agricultural and commercial pursuits until his death on January 19, 1822. <a href="Garrard%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Garrard County, Kentucky</a>, created during his first term, was named in his honor.

James Garrard was born in <a href="Stafford%20County%2C%20Virginia">Stafford County, Virginia</a>, on January 14, 1749. He was second of three children born to <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> William and Mary (Naughty) Garrard. Garrard's mother died sometime between 1755 and 1760; afterward, his father married Elizabeth Moss, and the couple had four more children. William Garrard was the county lieutenant of Stafford County, by virtue of which he held the rank of colonel and was in command of the county militia. The Garrard family was moderately wealthy, and the Stafford County courthouse was built on their land. During his childhood, James worked on his father's farm. He was educated in the <a href="common%20school">common school</a>s of Stafford County and studied at home, acquiring a fondness for books. Early in life, he associated himself with the Hartwood Baptist Church near <a href="Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia">Fredericksburg, Virginia</a>.

On December 20, 1769, Garrard married his childhood sweetheart, Elizabeth Mountjoy. Shortly thereafter, his sister Mary Anne married Mountjoy's brother, Colonel John Mountjoy. Garrard and his wife had five sons and seven daughters. One son and two daughters died before reaching age two. Of the surviving four sons, all participated in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> and all served in the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a>. A number of his grandsons served in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, including <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> Generals <a href="Kenner%20Garrard">Kenner Garrard</a> and <a href="Theophilus%20T.%20Garrard">Theophilus T. Garrard</a>. Another grandson, <a href="James%20H.%20Garrard">James H. Garrard</a>, was elected to five consecutive terms as <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Treasurer">state treasurer</a>, serving from 1857 until his death in 1865.

Garrard served in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a> as a member of his father's Stafford County militia, although it is not known how much combat he participated in. While on board a schooner on the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a>, he was captured by British forces. His captors offered to free him in exchange for military information, but he refused the offer and later escaped.

While serving in the militia in 1779, Garrard was elected to represent Stafford County the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a>, and he assumed his seat for the 1779 legislative session. His major contribution to the session was advocating for a bill that granted religious liberty to all residents of Virginia; passage of the bill ended persecution by citizens who associated with the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> upon followers of other faiths and countered an effort by some to establish the Church of England as Virginia's official church. After the session, he returned to his military duties. In 1781, he was promoted to the rank of colonel.

Following the revolution, Garrard faced the dual challenges of a growing family and depleted personal wealth. Acting on favorable reports from his former neighbor, <a href="John%20Edwards%20%28Kentucky%29">John Edwards</a>, Garrard and Samuel Grant headed west into the recently created <a href="Kentucky%20County%2C%20Virginia">Kentucky County</a>. By virtue of his military service, Garrard was entitled to claim any vacant land he surveyed and recorded at the state land office. Beginning in early 1783, Garrard made claims for family and friends, as well as for himself. Later in 1783, he moved his family to the land he had surveyed in <a href="Fayette%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fayette County</a>, which had been created from Kentucky County since his last visit to the region. Three years later, he employed John Metcalfe, a noted stonemason and older half-brother of future Kentucky Governor <a href="Thomas%20Metcalfe%20%28Kentucky%29">Thomas Metcalfe</a>, to build his estate, Mount Lebanon, on the Stoner Fork of the <a href="Licking%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Licking River</a>. There, he engaged in agriculture, opened a grist mill and a lumber mill, and distilled <a href="whiskey">whiskey</a>. In 1784, he enlisted in the Fayette County militia.

In 1785, Garrard was elected to represent Fayette County in the Virginia legislature. He was placed on a legislative committee with <a href="Benjamin%20Logan">Benjamin Logan</a> and <a href="Christopher%20Greenup">Christopher Greenup</a> to draft recommendations regarding the further division of Kentucky County. The committee recommended the creation of three new counties, including <a href="Madison%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Madison</a>, <a href="Mercer%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Mercer</a>, and Garrard's county of residence, <a href="Bourbon%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Bourbon</a>. On his return from the legislature, Garrard was chosen county surveyor and justice of the peace for the newly formed county. At various times, he also served as magistrate and colonel of the county militia.

Although some historians have identified Garrard as a member of the <a href="Danville%20Political%20Club">Danville Political Club</a>, a secret debating society that was active in <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville, Kentucky</a>, from 1786 to 1790, his name is not found in the Club's official membership records. Garrard's biographer, H. E. Everman, concludes that these historians may have mistaken Garrard's membership in the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge for membership in the Danville Political Club. The groups had similar aims, were active at about the same time, and had several members in common. Other notable members of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge included <a href="Isaac%20Shelby">Isaac Shelby</a>, Christopher Greenup, and <a href="Thomas%20Todd">Thomas Todd</a>, all future Kentucky governors or gubernatorial candidates.

Garrard's Mount Lebanon estate was designated as the temporary <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of Bourbon County; the county court first convened there on May 15, 1786, and continued to meet there for many years. In 1789, the Virginia legislature established a permanent county seat named Hopewell, and Garrard was part of the committee chosen to survey the area for the city. He and John Edwards were among the new settlement's first trustees. Upon Garrard's recommendation, the city's name was changed to <a href="Paris%2C%20Kentucky">Paris</a> in 1790. Soon after, he resigned as county surveyor to focus on more pressing needs of defense for the fledgling settlement. At his behest, the Bourbon County Court expanded its militia from one battalion to two at its meeting in August 1790.

As early as June 25, 1785, Garrard and his friend Augustine Eastin attended meetings of the Elkhorn <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> Association. In 1787, he helped organize the Cooper's Run Baptist Church near his estate. He was chosen as one of the church's elders and served the congregation there for ten years. Soon after its formation, the church joined the Elkhorn Baptist Association, and in 1789, it issued Garrard a license to preach. Although he owned as many as 23 slaves to work on his vast agricultural and industrial works, Garrard condemned slavery from the pulpit, calling it a "horrid evil". Whites and blacks participated equally in worship at Cooper's Run.

Garrard and the other elders of the church started numerous congregations in the state, including one as far away as <a href="Mason%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Mason County</a>. In 1789, Garrard and Eastin began working to reunite the more orthodox <a href="Regular%20Baptist">Regular Baptist</a>s in the area with the more liberal Separatist Baptists. Garrard's former church in Virginia had been a Regular Baptist congregation, and Garrard was considered a Regular Baptist despite his clear advocacy for religious toleration and his open expression of liberal views. Although he never succeeded in uniting the two factions, he was chosen moderator of the Elkhorn Baptist Association's annual meetings in 1790, 1791, and 1795 in recognition of his efforts.

From 1785 to 1799, Garrard served as a trustee of Transylvania Seminary (now <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a>). In 1794, the Baptist and more liberal trustees united against the orthodox <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> members of the board to elect the seminary's first non-Presbyterian president. That president was <a href="Harry%20Toulmin%20%28Unitarian%20minister%29">Harry Toulmin</a>, a <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> minister from England. Toulmin's daughter Lucinda would later marry Garrard's son Daniel. As a result of Garrard's relationship with Toulmin, he began to accept some tenets of Unitarianism, specifically the doctrines of <a href="Socinianism">Socinianism</a>. By 1802, Garrard and Augustine Eastin had not only adopted these beliefs, but had indoctrinated their Baptist congregations with them. The Elkhorn Baptist Association condemned these beliefs as heretical and encouraged Garrard and Eastin to abandon them. When that effort failed, the Association ceased correspondence and association with both men. This event ended Garrard's ministry and his association with the Baptist church.

Residents of what is now Kentucky called a series of ten conventions in <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville</a> to arrange their separation from Virginia. Garrard was a delegate to five of these conventions, held in May and August 1785 and in 1787, 1788, and 1792. At the August 1785 convention, the delegates unanimously approved a formal request for constitutional separation. As a member of the Virginia legislature, Garrard then traveled to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a> for the legislative session and voted in favor of the act specifying the conditions under which Virginia would accept Kentucky's separation.

Before the final convention in 1792, a committee composed of Garrard, Ambrose Dudley, and Augustine Eastin reported to the Elkhorn Baptist Association in favor of forbidding <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> in the constitution then being drafted for the new state. Slavery was a major issue in the 1792 convention that finalized the document. Delegate <a href="David%20Rice%20%28Presbyterian%20minister%29">David Rice</a>, a <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> minister, was the leading voice against the inclusion of slavery protections in the new constitution, while <a href="George%20Nicholas">George Nicholas</a> argued most strenuously in favor of them. Garrard encouraged his fellow ministers and Baptists to vote against its inclusion. The motion to delete Article 9 of the proposed document, which protected the rights of slave owners, failed by a vote of 16–26. Each of the seven Christian ministers who served as delegates to the convention (including Garrard) voted in favor of deleting the article. Five Baptist laymen defied Garrard's instructions and voted to retain Article 9; their votes provided the necessary margin for its inclusion. Historian <a href="Lowell%20H.%20Harrison">Lowell H. Harrison</a> wrote that the anti-slavery votes of the ministers may have accounted for the adoption of a provision that forbade ministers from serving in the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a>. Garrard and the other ministers apparently expressed no dissent against this provision.

Aside from his opposition to slavery, Garrard did not take a particularly active role in the convention's proceedings. His most notable action not related to slavery occurred on April 13, 1792, when he reported twenty-two resolutions from the <a href="committee%20of%20the%20whole">committee of the whole</a> that provided the framework for the new constitution.

Following the constitutional convention, it appeared that Garrard's political career was drawing to a close. He resigned all of his county offices to focus on his work in the Elkhorn Baptist Convention and his agricultural pursuits. He was pleased, however, when his son William was chosen to represent the county in the state legislature in 1793. In 1795, William Garrard was reelected, and the other four state legislators from Bourbon County were close associates of Garrard's, including John Edwards, who had recently been defeated for reelection to the U.S. Senate.
When Governor Isaac Shelby announced he would not seek reelection, Garrard's friends encouraged him to become a candidate. The other announced candidates were Benjamin Logan and Thomas Todd. Logan was considered the favorite in the race due to his military heroism while helping settle the Kentucky frontier. However, his oratory was unpolished, and his parliamentary skills were weak, despite his considerable political experience. Todd, who had served as secretary of all ten Kentucky statehood conventions, had the most political experience, but his youth was considered a disadvantage by some. Garrard benefited from his political connections in Bourbon County, and many held him in high regard due to his work in the Baptist church.

Under the new constitution, each of Kentucky's legislative districts chose an elector, and these electors voted to choose the governor. Both Logan and Garrard were chosen as electors from their respective counties. On the first ballot, Logan received the votes of 21 electors, Garrard received 17, and Todd received 14. A lone elector cast his vote for <a href="John%20Brown%20%28Kentucky%29">John Brown</a>, a Frankfort attorney who would soon be elected to the U.S. Senate. Some speculated that Garrard's moral character prevented him from voting for himself, but his political acumen prevented him from voting for a rival, so he voted for Brown, who had not declared his candidacy. No proof exists that this was the case, however.

The constitution did not specify whether a <a href="plurality%20%28voting%29">plurality</a> or a <a href="majority">majority</a> vote was required to elect the governor, but the electors, following a common practice of other states, decided to hold a second vote between Logan and Garrard in order to achieve a majority. Most of Todd's electors supported Garrard on the second vote, giving him a majority. In a letter dated May 17, 1796, <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Kentucky Secretary of State</a> <a href="James%20Brown%20%28Louisiana%29">James Brown</a> certified Garrard's election, and Governor Shelby sent him a letter of congratulations on his election on May 27.

Although he did not believe Garrard had personally done anything wrong, Logan formally protested the outcome of the election to <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">Kentucky Attorney General</a> <a href="John%20Breckinridge%20%28Virginia%20and%20Kentucky%29">John Breckinridge</a>. Breckinridge refused to render an official decision on the matter, claiming that neither the constitution nor the laws of the state empowered him to do so. Privately, however, he expressed his opinion that Logan had been legally elected. Logan then appealed to the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">state senate</a>, which was given the authority to intervene in disputed elections. In November 1796, the Senate opined that the law giving them that authority was unconstitutional because it did not promote the "peace and welfare" of the state. State senator <a href="Green%20Clay">Green Clay</a> was the primary proponent of this line of reasoning. By this time, Garrard had been serving as governor for five months, and Logan abandoned the quest to unseat him.

Garrard was regarded as a strong chief executive who surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors. His friend, John Edwards, and his son, William Garrard, were both in the state senate and kept him abreast of issues there. He showed that he was willing to continue with Shelby's direction for the state by re-appointing Secretary of State James Brown, but the aging Brown retired in October 1796, only a few months into Garrard's term. Garrard then appointed Harry Toulmin, who had resigned the presidency of Transylvania Seminary in April due to opposition from the institution's more conservative trustees. Although he did not retain outgoing Attorney General John Breckinridge, who had sided with Logan in the disputed gubernatorial election, Garrard still frequently consulted with him on complex legal questions.
During Governor Shelby's term, the General Assembly had passed laws requiring that the governor, auditor, <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Treasurer">treasurer</a>, and secretary of state live in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a> and allocating a sum of 100 <a href="Pound%20%28currency%29">pounds</a> to rent living quarters for the governor. Shortly after Garrard took office, the state commissioners of public buildings reported to the legislature that it would be more financially sensible to construct a house for the governor and his large family than to rent living quarters for them for the duration of his term. On December 4, 1796, the General Assembly passed legislation appropriating 1,200 pounds for the construction of such a house. The state's <a href="Old%20Governor%27s%20Mansion%20%28Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky%29">first governor's mansion</a> was completed in 1798. Garrard incited considerable public interest when, in 1799, he commissioned a local craftsman to build a piano for one of his daughters; most Kentuckians had never seen such a grand instrument, and a considerable number of them flocked to the governor's mansion to see it when it was finished. Kentucky historian <a href="Thomas%20D.%20Clark">Thomas D. Clark</a> also relates that Garrard's addition of carpeting to the mansion – a rare amenity at the time – drew many visitors and was described by one as "the envy and pride of the community".

Among the other acts passed during the first year of Garrard's term were laws establishing the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> and a system of lower district courts. For the first time, lawyers in the state were required to be licensed. Six new counties – including one named in Garrard's honor – were created, along with several new settlements. Garrard approved enabling acts creating twenty-six counties; no other Kentucky governor oversaw the creation of as many.

Left undone, however, was extending the laws dealing with surveying and registering land claims with the registrar of the state land office. Cognizant that the old law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on his experience as a surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-<a href="Squatting%20in%20the%20United%20States">squatting</a> legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.

Garrard was a member of the <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republican Party</a> and agreed with party founder <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s condemnation of the <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a>. In an address to the General Assembly on November 7, 1798, he denounced the Alien Act on the grounds that it deterred desirable immigration; the Sedition Act, he claimed, denied those accused under its provisions <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a> and <a href="trial%20by%20jury">trial by jury</a>, rights – he pointed out – that he and the other soldiers of the Revolutionary War had fought to secure. He advocated the <a href="Nullification%20%28U.S.%20Constitution%29">nullification</a> of both laws, but also encouraged the legislature to reaffirm its loyalty to the federal government and the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a>. He was supportive of the <a href="Kentucky%20Resolutions">Kentucky Resolutions</a> of 1798 and 1799.

Among the other issues addressed in the 1798 General Assembly was the adoption of penal reforms. Garrard was supportive of the reforms – which included the abolition of <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20States">the death penalty</a> for all crimes except murder – and lobbied for the education of incarcerated individuals. He also secured the passage of laws reforming and expanding the militia. Among the reforms were the imposition of penalties upon "distractors" in the militia, provisions for citizens' hiring of substitutes to serve in the militia on their behalf, and the exemption of jailers, tutors, printers, judges, ministers, and legislative leaders from service. Garrard opposed lowering taxes, instead advocating increased spending on education and business subsidies. To that end, he signed legislation combining Transylvania Seminary and Kentucky Academy into a single institution.

The difficulties with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 added to a litany of complaints about the state's first constitution. Some believed that it was undemocratic because it required electors to choose the governor and state senators and many offices were appointive rather than elective. Others opposed life terms for judges and other state officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the document, or to lift the ban on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In the aftermath of the disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided no means for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention.

Calling a constitutional convention required the approval of a majority of voters in two successive elections or a <a href="two-thirds%20majority">two-thirds majority</a> of both houses of the General Assembly. In February 1797, the General Assembly voted to put the question before the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast doubt in the minds of many legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should be counted as votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention. When all of the irregularities were accounted for, the General Assembly determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority.

On February 10, 1798, Garrard's son William, still serving in the state senate, introduced a bill to hold another vote on calling a constitutional convention. In May 1798, 9,188 of the 16,388 votes were in favor of calling a convention. Again, almost 5,000 of the ballots contained no vote either way. On November 21, 1798, the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> voted 36–15 in favor of a convention, and the Senate provided its requisite two-thirds majority days later. No official tally of the Senate's vote was published. The Assembly's vote rendered moot any doubts about the popular vote.

Delegates to the July 22, 1799, convention were elected in May 1799. Neither Garrard nor his son William were chosen as delegates, mostly due to their anti-slavery views. Garrard had been a more active governor than his predecessor, frequently employing his veto and clashing with the county courts. As a result, the delegates moved to reign in some of the power given to the state's chief executive. Under the 1799 constitution, the governor was <a href="Direct%20election">popularly elected</a>, and the threshold for overriding a gubernatorial <a href="veto">veto</a> was lowered from a two-thirds majority of each house of the legislature to an absolute majority. Although the governor retained broad appointment powers, the state senate was given the power to approve or reject all gubernatorial nominees. New <a href="Term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">term limits</a> were imposed on the governor, making him ineligible for reelection for seven years following the expiration of his term. The restriction on ministers serving in the legislature was retained and extended to the governor's office. Historian Lowell Harrison held that this restriction was "a clear snub to Garrard", but Garrard biographer H. E. Everman maintained that it was "definitely not a blow aimed at Garrard". Garrard was personally exempted from both the succession and ministerial restrictions, clearing the way for him to seek a second term.

Confident that the results of the 1795 election would be reversed, Benjamin Logan was the first to declare his candidacy for the governorship in 1799. Garrard and Thomas Todd declared their respective candidacies soon after. Former <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. Representative</a> <a href="Christopher%20Greenup">Christopher Greenup</a> also sought the office. Many of the recent settlers in Kentucky were unaware of his illustrious military record and unimpressed with his unsophisticated speaking skills. Although the candidates themselves rarely spoke negatively of each other, opponents of each candidate independently raised issues that they felt would hurt that candidate. John Breckinridge, Garrard's long-time political nemesis, tried to goad Garrard into making another impassioned plea for emancipation of slaves, which was a minority position in the state, but Garrard recognized Breckinridge's tactics and refused to express any bold emancipationist sentiments during the campaign. The fact that the slavery protections in the new constitution were even stronger than those in the previous document ensured that the incumbent's previous anti-slavery sentiments were not a major concern to most of the electorate. The family of Henry Field, a prominent leader in Frankfort, attacked Garrard for not issuing a <a href="clemency">pardon</a> for Field, who was convicted of murdering his wife with an ax. After examining the evidence in the case, Garrard concluded that the verdict was reached justly and without undue outside influence, but the charge was raised so late in the campaign that Garrard's defense of his refusal to issue a pardon could not be circulated widely.

With the advantages of incumbency and a generally popular record, Garrard garnered large majorities in the state's western counties, <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Jefferson County</a>, and the <a href="Bluegrass%20region">Bluegrass region</a> of central Kentucky. Surprisingly, he even found support among some voters who had favored Logan four years earlier. The final voting showed Garrard the winner with 8,390 votes, followed by Greenup with 6,746, Logan with 3,996, and Todd with 2,166. Due to the term limits imposed by the new constitution, Garrard was the last Kentucky governor elected to succeed himself until a 1992 amendment to the state constitution loosened the prohibition on gubernatorial succession, and <a href="Paul%20E.%20Patton">Paul E. Patton</a> was reelected in 1999. In 1801, Garrard nominated Todd to fill the next vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals after the election. Similarly, he appointed Greenup to a position on the Frankfort Circuit Court in 1802.

The first two years of Garrard's second term were relatively uneventful, but in the 1802 General Assembly, legislators approved two bills related to the circuit court system that Garrard vetoed. The first bill expanded the number of courts and provided that untrained citizens could sit as judges in the court system. Garrard questioned the cost of the additional courts and the wisdom of allowing untrained judges on the bench; he also objected to the bill's circumvention of the governor's authority to appoint judges. The second bill allowed attorneys and judges in the circuit court system to reside outside the districts they served. The General Assembly overrode Garrard's second veto, marking the first time in Kentucky history that a gubernatorial veto was overridden and the only time during Garrard's eight-year tenure.
On October 16, 1802, Spanish intendent Don Juan Ventura Morales announced the revocation of the U.S. right of deposit at <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans</a>, a right that had been guaranteed under <a href="Pinckney%27s%20Treaty">Pinckney's Treaty</a>. The closure of the port to U.S. goods represented a major impediment to Garrard's hopes of establishing a vibrant trade between Kentucky and the other states and territories along the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. He urged <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> to act and publicly declared that Kentucky had 26,000 militiamen ready to take New Orleans by force if necessary. Jefferson was unaware, however, that the secret <a href="Third%20Treaty%20of%20San%20Ildefonso">Treaty of San Ildefonso</a> had ceded control of <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">Louisiana</a> to the French dictator <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> in 1800, although a formal transfer had not yet been made. As Jefferson deliberated, Napoleon unexpectedly offered to sell Louisiana to the United States for approximately $15 million. <a href="Robert%20R.%20Livingston%20%28chancellor%29">Robert R. Livingston</a> and <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>, Jefferson's envoys in France, <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">accepted the offer</a>. The purchase delighted most Kentuckians, and Garrard hailed it as a "noble achievement". Soon after the agreement, the Spanish government claimed that the French had not performed their part of the Treaty of Ildefonso and, as a result, the treaty was nullified and Louisiana still belonged to Spain. Jefferson ignored the Spanish protest and prepared to take Louisiana by force. He instructed Garrard to have 4,000 militiamen ready to march to New Orleans by December 20, 1803. The Kentucky General Assembly quickly passed a measure guaranteeing 150 acres of land to anyone who volunteered for military service, and Garrard was soon able to inform Jefferson that his quota was met. Spain then reversed course, relinquishing its claims to Louisiana, and the territory passed into U.S. control two months later.

The last months of Garrard's second term were marred by a dispute with the General Assembly over naming a new registrar of the state's land office. Garrard first named Secretary of State Harry Toulmin, but the Senate rejected that nomination on December 7, 1803. Next, Garrard nominated former rival Christopher Greenup, but Greenup had designs on succeeding Garrard and asked Garrard to withdraw the nomination, which he did. The Senate then rejected Garrard's next nominee, John Coburn, and accused the next, Thomas Jones, of "high criminal offense" and barred him from any further appointive office.

Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a bill that would have allowed the legislature to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected <a href="Willis%20Green">Willis Green</a> in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated <a href="John%20Adair">John Adair</a>, the popular <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a>. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.

His dispute with the General Assembly over the naming of a land registrar left Garrard embittered, and he retired from politics at the expiration of his second term. He privately backed Christopher Greenup's bid to succeed him in 1804, and Bourbon County's vote broke heavily for Greenup in the election. Although his sons William and James would continue running for public office into the 1830s, Garrard never indicated a desire to run again.

Garrard returned to Mount Lebanon, where he developed a reputation as a notable agriculturist. His son James oversaw the day-to-day operation of the farm and frequently won prizes for his innovations at local agricultural fairs. The Mount Lebanon estate was badly damaged by one of the <a href="1811%E2%80%931812%20New%20Madrid%20earthquakes">New Madrid earthquakes</a> in 1811, but Garrard insisted on repairing the damage as thoroughly as possible in order to reside there for the rest of his life. He imported fine livestock – including <a href="thoroughbred">thoroughbred</a> horses and cattle – to his farm and invested in several commercial enterprises, including several saltworks, which passed to his sons upon his death. He died on January 19, 1822, following several years of feeble health. He was buried on the grounds of his Mount Lebanon estate, and the state of Kentucky erected a monument over his grave site.

Charles Scott (governor)

Charles Scott (April 1739October22, 1813) was an 18th-century American soldier who was elected the fourth <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor of Kentucky</a> in 1808. Orphaned in his teens, Scott enlisted in the <a href="Virginia%20Regiment">Virginia Regiment</a> in October 1755 and served as a scout and escort during the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>. He quickly rose through the ranks to become a <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">captain</a>. After the war, he married and engaged in agricultural pursuits on land left to him by his father, but he returned to active military service in 1775 as the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> began to grow in intensity. In August 1776, he was promoted to <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> and given command of the <a href="5th%20Virginia%20Regiment">5th Virginia Regiment</a>. The 5th Virginia joined <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> in <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> later that year, serving with him for the duration of the <a href="Philadelphia%20campaign">Philadelphia campaign</a>. Scott commanded Washington's light infantry, and by late 1778 was also serving as his chief of intelligence. <a href="Furlough">Furlough</a>ed at the end of the Philadelphia campaign, Scott returned to active service in March 1779 and was ordered to <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> to assist General <a href="Benjamin%20Lincoln">Benjamin Lincoln</a> in the <a href="Southern%20theater%20of%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">southern theater</a>. He arrived in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, just as <a href="Henry%20Clinton%20%28American%20War%20of%20Independence%29">Henry Clinton</a> had begun his <a href="Siege%20of%20Charleston">siege of the city</a>. Scott was taken as a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> when Charleston surrendered. Paroled in March 1781 and <a href="prisoner%20exchange">exchanged</a> for <a href="Francis%20Rawdon-Hastings%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Hastings">Lord Rawdon</a> in July 1782, Scott managed to complete a few recruiting assignments before the war ended.

After the war, Scott visited the western frontier in 1785 and began to make preparations for a permanent relocation. He resettled near present-day <a href="Versailles%2C%20Kentucky">Versailles, Kentucky</a>, in 1787. Confronted by the dangers of Indian raids, Scott raised a company of volunteers in 1790 and joined <a href="Josiah%20Harmar">Josiah Harmar</a> for an expedition against the Indians. After <a href="Harmar%27s%20Defeat">Harmar's Defeat</a>, President Washington ordered <a href="Arthur%20St.%20Clair">Arthur St. Clair</a> to prepare for an invasion of Indian lands in the <a href="Northwest%20Territory">Northwest Territory</a>. In the meantime, Scott, by now holding the rank of <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> in the Virginia militia, was ordered to conduct a series of preliminary raids. In July 1791, he led the most notable and successful of these raids against the village of <a href="Fort%20Ouiatenon">Ouiatenon</a>. St. Clair's main invasion, conducted later that year, was a failure. Shortly after the separation of Kentucky from Virginia in 1792, the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> commissioned Scott as a <a href="major%20general">major general</a> and gave him command of the 2nd Division of the Kentucky militia. Scott's division cooperated with <a href="Anthony%20Wayne">"Mad" Anthony Wayne</a>'s <a href="Legion%20of%20the%20United%20States">Legion of the United States</a> for the rest of the <a href="Northwest%20Indian%20War">Northwest Indian War</a>, including their decisive victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fallen%20Timbers">Battle of Fallen Timbers</a>.

Having previously served in the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a> and as a <a href="United%20States%20electoral%20college">presidential elector</a>, the aging Scott now ran for governor. His 1808 campaign was skillfully managed by his step-son-in-law, <a href="Jesse%20Bledsoe">Jesse Bledsoe</a>, and he won a convincing victory over <a href="John%20Allen%20%28soldier%29">John Allen</a> and <a href="Green%20Clay">Green Clay</a>. A fall on the icy steps of the <a href="Old%20Governor%27s%20Mansion%20%28Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky%29">governor's mansion</a> early in his term confined Scott to crutches for the rest of his life, and left him heavily reliant on Bledsoe, whom he appointed <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Secretary of State</a>. Although he frequently clashed with the state legislature over domestic matters, the primary concern of his administration was the increasing tension between the United States and Great Britain that eventually led to the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. Scott's decision to appoint <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> as <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> major general in the Kentucky militia, although probably in violation of the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">state constitution</a> as Harrison was not a resident of the state, was nonetheless praised by the state's citizens. After his term expired, Scott returned to his Canewood estate. His health declined rapidly, and he died on October22, 1813. <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Scott County, Kentucky</a>, and <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Indiana">Scott County, Indiana</a>, are named in his honor, as are the cities of <a href="Scottsville%2C%20Kentucky">Scottsville, Kentucky</a>, and <a href="Scottsville%2C%20Virginia">Scottsville, Virginia</a>.

Charles Scott was born in 1739, probably in April, in the part of <a href="Goochland%20County%2C%20Virginia">Goochland County, Virginia</a>, that is now <a href="Powhatan%20County%2C%20Virginia">Powhatan County</a>. His father, Samuel Scott, was a farmer and member of the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Burgesses">Virginia House of Burgesses</a>. His mother, whose name is not known, died most likely around 1745. Scott had an older brother, John, and three younger siblings, Edward, Joseph, and Martha. He received only a basic education from his parents and in the rural Virginia schools near his home.

Shortly after his father died in 1755, Scott was apprenticed to a carpenter. In late July 1755, a local court was preparing to place him with a guardian, but in October, before the court acted, Scott enlisted in the <a href="Virginia%20Regiment">Virginia Regiment</a>. He was assigned to David Bell's <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a>. During the early part of the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>, he won praise from his superiors as a frontier scout and woodsman. Most of his fellow soldiers were undisciplined and poorly trained, allowing Scott to stand out and quickly rise to the rank of <a href="corporal">corporal</a>. By June 1756, he had been promoted to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>.

Scott served under <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> in the <a href="Braddock%20Expedition">Braddock Expedition</a>, a failed attempt to capture <a href="Fort%20Duquesne">Fort Duquesne</a> from the French. For most of 1756 and the early part of 1757, he divided his time between <a href="Fort%20Cumberland%20%28Maryland%29">Fort Cumberland</a> and Fort Washington, conducting scouting and escort missions. In April 1757, David Bell was relieved of his command as part of a general downsizing of Washington's regiment, and Scott was assigned to <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">Captain</a> Robert McKenzie at <a href="Fort%20Pearsall">Fort Pearsall</a>. In August and September, Washington sent Scott and a small scouting party on two reconnaissance missions to Fort Duquesne in preparation for an assault on that fort, but the party learned little on either mission. In November, Scott was part of the <a href="Forbes%20Expedition">Forbes Expedition</a> that captured the fort. He spent the latter part of the year at <a href="Fort%20Loudoun%20%28Virginia%29">Fort Loudoun</a>, where Washington promoted him to <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a>.

Scott spent most of 1759 conducting escort missions and constructing roads and forts. During this time, Virginia's forces were taken from George Washington and put under the control of <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="William%20Byrd%20III">William Byrd</a>. In July 1760, Scott was named the fifth captain of a group of Virginia troops that Byrd led on an expedition against the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> in 1760. Scott's exact role in the campaign is not known. The expedition was a success, and Virginia Governor <a href="Francis%20Fauquier">Francis Fauquier</a> ordered the force disbanded in February 1762; Scott had left the army at some unknown date prior to that.

Sometime prior to 1762, Scott's older brother, John, died, leaving Scott to inherit his father's land near the <a href="James%20River">James River</a> and <a href="Muddy%20Creek%20%28Virginia%29">Muddy Creek</a>. Having left the army, he had settled on his inherited farm by late 1761. On February25, 1762, he married Frances Sweeney from <a href="Cumberland%20County%2C%20Virginia">Cumberland County, Virginia</a>. With the help of approximately 10 <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a>, Scott engaged in growing <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> and milling flour on his farm. In July 1766, he was named one of two captains in the local militia. Over the next several years, Scott and his wife had four boys and four or five girls.

As the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> intensified in 1775, Scott raised a company of volunteers in Cumberland County. It was the first company formed south of the James River to participate in the Revolution. The company stood ready to aid <a href="Patrick%20Henry">Patrick Henry</a> in an anticipated clash with <a href="John%20Murray%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Dunmore">Lord Dunmore</a> at <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg, Virginia</a>, in May 1775, but Dunmore abandoned the city in June, and they joined units from the surrounding counties in Williamsburg later that month. In July, the <a href="Third%20Virginia%20Convention">Virginia Convention</a> created two regiments of Virginia troops, one under Patrick Henry and the other under <a href="William%20Woodford">William Woodford</a>. As those leaders departed for Williamsburg, the Conventions acknowledged Scott as temporary commander-in-chief of the volunteers already assembled there. On August17, 1775, he was elected <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a> of Woodford's regiment, the <a href="2nd%20Virginia%20Regiment">2nd Virginia</a>. His younger brother, Joseph, served as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the regiment. In December, Woodford dispatched Scott and 150 men to <a href="Great%20Bridge%2C%20Virginia">Great Bridge, Virginia</a>, to defend a crossing point on the <a href="Elizabeth%20River%20%28Virginia%29">Elizabeth River</a>. Days later, this force played a significant role in the December9, 1775, <a href="Battle%20of%20Great%20Bridge">Battle of Great Bridge</a> by killing British Captain <a href="Charles%20Fordyce">Charles Fordyce</a>, thereby halting the British advance on the crossing. Following the battle, colonial forces were able to occupy the city of <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, and Lord Dunmore eventually departed from Virginia.

On February13, 1776, the 2nd Virginia became a part of the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>; Scott retained his rank of lieutenant colonel during the transition. After spending the winter with part of the 2nd Virginia in <a href="Suffolk%2C%20Virginia">Suffolk</a>, Scott was chosen by the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> as colonel of the <a href="5th%20Virginia%20Regiment">5th Virginia Regiment</a> on August12, 1776; he replaced Colonel <a href="William%20Peachy">William Peachy</a>, who had resigned. The 5th Virginia was stationed in the cities of <a href="Hampton%2C%20Virginia">Hampton</a> and <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20Virginia">Portsmouth</a> through the end of September. They were then ordered to join George Washington in <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, eventually repairing to the city of <a href="Trenton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Trenton</a> in November.

Serving as part of <a href="Adam%20Stephen">Adam Stephen</a>'s brigade, Scott's 5th Virginia Regiment fought in the colonial victory at the December26 <a href="Battle%20of%20Trenton">Battle of Trenton</a>. During the subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Assunpink%20Creek">Battle of the Assunpink Creek</a> on January2, 1777, the 5th Virginia helped slow the advance of a combined force of British light infantry and <a href="Hessian%20%28soldiers%29">Hessian</a> mercenaries toward Trenton. Major George Johnston, a member of the 5th Virginia, opined that Scott had "acquired immortal honor" from his performance at Assunpink Creek. Following these battles, Washington's main force prepared to spend the winter at <a href="Morristown%2C%20New%20Jersey">Morristown, New Jersey</a>, while Scott's regiment was based at nearby <a href="Chatham%2C%20New%20Jersey">Chatham</a>. From this base, he led light infantry raids against British foraging parties. In his most notable engagement – the February1 <a href="Battle%20of%20Drake%27s%20Farm">Battle of Drake's Farm</a> – he defeated a superior combination of British and Hessian soldiers. He led another notable raid against a large British force of about 2,000 at the February8 <a href="Battle%20of%20Quibbletown">Battle of Quibbletown</a>.
In March 1777, Scott returned to his Virginia farm, taking his first <a href="furlough">furlough</a> in more than a year. In recognition of his service with Washington, Congress commissioned him a <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> on April2, 1777. At Washington's request, he returned to Trenton on May10, 1777. His 4th Virginia Brigade and another brigade under William Woodford constituted the Virginia <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a>, commanded by Adam Stephen, who had been promoted to <a href="major%20general">major general</a>. With Stephen and Brigadier General <a href="William%20Maxwell%20%28Continental%20Army%20general%29">William Maxwell</a> ill, Scott assumed temporary command of the division between May19 and 24. Washington spent much of mid-1777 trying to anticipate and counter the moves of British General <a href="William%20Howe%2C%205th%20Viscount%20Howe">William Howe</a>, and the lull in the fighting allowed Scott time to file a protest with Congress regarding how his seniority and rank had been calculated. After eight months of deliberation, Congress concurred with Scott's protest, placing him ahead of fellow brigadier general <a href="George%20Weedon">George Weedon</a> in seniority.

At the September11 <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandywine">Battle of Brandywine</a>, the 4th Virginia Brigade stubbornly resisted the advance of General <a href="Charles%20Cornwallis%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Cornwallis">Charles Cornwallis</a>, but was ultimately forced to retreat. Following the British victory, Howe marched toward <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a>, stopping briefly at <a href="Germantown%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Germantown</a>. Scott persistently advocated for an attack on Howe's position at Germantown, and although he was initially in the minority among Washington's generals, he ultimately prevailed upon Washington to conduct the attack. On October4, 1777, the 4th Virginia attacked the British in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Germantown">Battle of Germantown</a>. Because of their circuitous route to the battle, the field was already covered by heavy smoke from <a href="musket">musket</a>s and a fire set by the British in a dry <a href="buckwheat">buckwheat</a> field when they arrived; they and the other colonial forces were lost in the smoke and retreated.

After the defeat at Germantown, Washington's troops took a position in the hills surrounding <a href="Whitemarsh%20Township%2C%20Montgomery%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania</a>, about from Philadelphia. Scott and four other generals initially favored an attack on Philadelphia in December, but after hearing Washington's assessment of the enemy's defenses there, they abandoned the idea. After <a href="Battle%20of%20White%20Marsh">a series of skirmishes with Howe's men near Whitemarsh</a>, Washington's army camped for the winter at <a href="Valley%20Forge">Valley Forge</a>. Scott was afforded the luxury of boarding at the farm of Samuel Jones, about three miles from the camp, but rode out to inspect his brigade daily. Washington granted him a furlough in mid-March 1778, and he returned to Valley Forge on May20, 1778.

When Washington and his men abandoned Valley Forge in mid-June 1778, Scott was ordered to take 1,500 light infantrymen and harass the British forces as they marched across New Jersey. On June26, the <a href="Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20marquis%20de%20Lafayette">Marquis de Lafayette</a> joined Scott with an additional 1,000 men, in anticipation of a major offensive the next day. General <a href="Charles%20Lee%20%28general%29">Charles Lee</a> was chosen to command the operation, which was delayed by one day due to inadequate communications and delays in forwarding provisions. Lee shared no battle plan with his generals, later claiming he had insufficient intelligence to form one. On the morning of June28, Lee launched the attack, beginning the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monmouth">Battle of Monmouth</a>. During the battle, Scott observed American artillerymen retreating. Not realizing that the men had only run out of ammunition, Scott believed the retreat was a sign of the collapse of the American offensive and ordered his men to retreat as well. Lacking a battle plan for guidance, William Maxwell and <a href="Anthony%20Wayne">Anthony Wayne</a>, whose units were fighting adjacent to Scott's men, also ordered a retreat. With such a great number of his men retreating, Lee fell back and eventually aborted the offensive. Although Washington's main force arrived and stopped the British advance, Scott's retreat was partially blamed for giving them control of the battle. Tradition holds that, in the aftermath of the battle, Scott witnessed Washington excoriating Lee in a profanity-laden tirade, but biographer Harry M. Ward considered it unlikely that Scott was present at the meeting. Lee was later <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>ed for the retreat and suspended from command.

Following the Battle of Monmouth, the British retreated to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. On August14, Scott was given command of a new light infantry corps organized by Washington. He also served as Washington's chief of intelligence, conducting constant scouting missions from the Americans' new base at <a href="White%20Plains%2C%20New%20York">White Plains, New York</a>. While Scott's men engaged in a few skirmishes with British scouting parties, neither Washington's army nor the British force at New York City conducted any major operations before Scott was furloughed in November 1778.

A March 1779 letter from Washington to Scott, still on furlough in Virginia, ordered him to recruit volunteers in Virginia and join Washington at <a href="Middlebrook%20encampment">Middlebrook</a> on May1. Men and supplies proved difficult to obtain, delaying Scott's return; during the delay, Washington ordered the recruits to <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> to join <a href="Benjamin%20Lincoln">Benjamin Lincoln</a>, who was in command of the militia forces there. Reports of significant British troop movements toward <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> had convinced Washington that the enemy was preparing an invasion from the south.
Soon after Washington's orders were delivered, a British raiding party under <a href="George%20Collier">George Collier</a> and <a href="Edward%20Mathew">Edward Mathew</a> arrived in Virginia to capture or destroy supplies that might otherwise be sent southward to aid the reinforcements going to South Carolina. Scott's orders changed again; the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a> ordered him to immediately prepare defenses against Collier and Mathew's raids. When it became clear to both the legislature and Washington that Collier and Mathew intended only to raid supplies, not to invade, they concluded that the local militia would be able to sufficiently protect Virginia's interests and that Scott should continue to recruit men to reinforce the south. The legislators presented him with a horse, a firearm, and 500 <a href="pound%20sterling">pounds sterling</a> for his quick response to the threat.

Scott's recruiting difficulties in Virginia continued, despite the implementation of a <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">draft</a> by the state legislature. Finally, in October 1779, he forwarded troops sent to him from Washington's Northern Army on to Lincoln in South Carolina, fulfilling his quota. He retained only <a href="Abraham%20Buford">Abraham Buford</a>'s regiment with him in Virginia. In February 1780, about 750 men sent by Washington under William Woodford arrived at Scott's camp in <a href="Petersburg%2C%20Virginia">Petersburg, Virginia</a>. Virginia authorities, fearing that the British force to the south under General <a href="Henry%20Clinton%20%28American%20War%20of%20Independence%29">Henry Clinton</a> would turn north to Virginia, detained Scott and Woodford until it was clear that Clinton's object was Lincoln's position at <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>.

On March30, 1780, Scott arrived in Charleston just as Clinton was <a href="Siege%20of%20Charleston">laying siege to the city</a>. He was captured when the city surrendered on May12, 1780, and was held as a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> at <a href="Mount%20Pleasant%2C%20South%20Carolina">Haddrell's Point</a> near Charleston. Although he was a prisoner, he was given freedom to move within a six-mile radius and was allowed to correspond and trade with acquaintances in Virginia. With the death of William Woodford on November13, 1780, he became primarily responsible for the welfare of the Virginia troops at Haddrell's Point. He requested his parole on account of ill health on January30, 1781, and in late March, Charles Cornwallis granted the request.

In July 1782, Scott was <a href="prisoner%20exchange">exchanged</a> for <a href="Francis%20Rawdon-Hastings%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Hastings">Lord Rawdon</a>, ending his parole. Washington informed him that he was back on active duty and ordered him to assist General <a href="Peter%20Muhlenberg">Peter Muhlenberg</a>'s recruiting efforts in Virginia, then to report to General <a href="Nathanael%20Greene">Nathanael Greene</a>. Greene wrote that he did not have a command for Scott, and requested that he remain with Muhlenberg in Virginia. The few troops he was able to recruit were sent to a depot at <a href="Winchester%2C%20Virginia">Winchester, Virginia</a>. When the preliminary articles of peace between the United States and Great Britain were signed in March 1783, recruiting stopped altogether. Scott was <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevetted</a> to major general on September30, 1783, just prior to his discharge from the Continental Army. Following the war, he became one of the founding members of the <a href="Society%20of%20the%20Cincinnati">Society of the Cincinnati</a>.

In October 1783, the Virginia Legislature authorized Scott to commission superintendents and surveyors to survey the lands given to soldiers for their service in the Revolutionary War. Enticed by glowing reports of Kentucky by his friend, <a href="James%20Wilkinson">James Wilkinson</a>, he arranged for a cabin to be built for him near the <a href="Kentucky%20River">Kentucky River</a>, although the builder apparently laid only the cornerstone. Scott first visited Kentucky in mid-1785. Traveling with <a href="Peyton%20Short">Peyton Short</a>, one of Wilkinson's business partners, he came to Limestone (present-day <a href="Maysville%2C%20Kentucky">Maysville, Kentucky</a>) via the <a href="Monongahela%20River">Monongahela</a> and <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio</a> Rivers. Scott and Short then traveled overland to the Kentucky River to examine the land they would later claim. Scott's stay in Kentucky was a short one; he had returned to his farm in Virginia by September 1785.

On his return to Virginia, Scott employed <a href="Edward%20Carrington">Edward Carrington</a>, former quartermaster general of the Southern Army, to set his financial affairs in order in preparation for a move to Kentucky. Carrington purchased Scott's Virginia farm in 1785, but allowed the family to live there until they moved to the frontier. In 1787, Scott settled near the city of <a href="Versailles%2C%20Kentucky">Versailles, Kentucky</a>. Between his military claims and those of his children, the Scott family was entitled to in <a href="Fayette%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fayette</a> and <a href="Bourbon%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Bourbon</a> counties. Scott constructed a two-story <a href="log%20cabin">log cabin</a>, a stockade, and a tobacco inspection warehouse. In June 1787, <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a> warriors killed and <a href="Scalping">scalped</a> his son, Samuel, while he was crossing the Ohio River in a canoe; the elder Scott watched helplessly from the riverbank. Although a small party of settlers pursued the Shawnees back across the river, they were not able to overtake them. In volume three of <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s "The Winning of the West", he stated that Scott "delighted in war" against the Indians after the death of his son.

Scott focused on the development of his homestead as a way to deal with the grief of losing his son. The settlement became known as Scott's Landing, and Scott briefly served as a tobacco inspector for the area. Determined to make Scott's Landing the centerpiece of a larger settlement called Petersburg, he began selling lots near the settlement in November 1788. Among those who purchased lots were James Wilkinson, Abraham Buford, Judge <a href="George%20Muter">George Muter</a>, and future <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Congressman</a> and <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Kentucky Governor</a> <a href="Christopher%20Greenup">Christopher Greenup</a>.

Scott was one of 37 men who founded the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge in 1787. Although he did not participate in any of the ten statehood conventions that sought to separate Kentucky from Virginia, he supported the idea in principle. When <a href="Woodford%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Woodford County</a> was formed from the part of Fayette County that included Scott's fledgling settlement, Scott declined appointment as the new county's lieutenant. He consented to be a candidate to represent the county in the Virginia House of Delegates. During his single term, he served on the committee on privileges and election and on several special committees, including one that recommended that President George Washington supply a military guard at <a href="Big%20Bone%20Lick%20State%20Park">Big Bone Lick</a> to facilitate the establishment of a <a href="Saltern">saltworks</a> there.

As tensions mounted between the Indians in the <a href="Northwest%20Territory">Northwest Territory</a> and settlers on the Kentucky frontier, President Washington began sanctioning joint operations between federal army troops and local frontier militia against the Indians. In April 1790, Scott raised a contingent of volunteers from Bourbon and Fayette counties to join <a href="Josiah%20Harmar">Josiah Harmar</a> in a raid against the <a href="Western%20Confederacy">Western Confederacy</a> along the <a href="Scioto%20River">Scioto River</a> in what would become the U.S. state of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>. The combined force of regulars and militia departed from Limestone on April18, 1790, crossing the Ohio River and marching to the upper Scioto. From there, they headed south, toward the present-day city of <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20Ohio">Portsmouth, Ohio</a>, and discovered an abandoned Indian camp. Fresh footprints, including those of a well-known Shawnee warrior – nicknamed Reel Foot because of his two <a href="Club%20foot">club feet</a> – led away from the camp site. Scott sent a small detachment to follow the tracks; ultimately, they discovered and killed four Shawnee, including Reel Foot. Other than this, the expedition accomplished nothing, and it disbanded on August27, 1790.

In June 1790, Harmar and <a href="Arthur%20St.%20Clair">Arthur St. Clair</a> were ordered to lead <a href="Harmar%20Campaign">another expedition</a> against the Indians. Harmar had hoped that Scott, <a href="Isaac%20Shelby">Isaac Shelby</a>, or <a href="Benjamin%20Logan">Benjamin Logan</a> would join the campaign and lead the Kentucky militia, but all three declined. Scott had been elected to represent Woodford County in the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a>, and his legislative duty prevented his service. He believed that the Kentucky militiamen would only serve under Colonel Robert Trotter, a veteran of Logan's earlier Indian fighting campaigns. Ultimately, command of the Kentucky militiamen was given to Major John Hardin, and many militiamen refused to join the campaign, just as Scott had predicted. During the expedition, Scott's son, Merritt, who was serving as a captain in the Woodford County militia, was killed and scalped. The entire expedition was a failure, and it solidified the Kentucky militiamen's strong distrust of Harmar; most vowed never to fight alongside him again.

During Harmar's Campaign, Scott was serving in the state legislature in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>. He was once again appointed to the committee on privileges and election. He also served on the committee on propositions and grievances and several special committees. On December30, 1790, <a href="Governor%20of%20Virginia">Virginia Governor</a> <a href="Beverley%20Randolph">Beverley Randolph</a>, possibly acting on a recommendation from Washington, appointed Scott brigadier general in the Virginia militia and gave him command of the entire District of Kentucky. His primary responsibility was overseeing a line of 18 outposts along the Ohio River. In January 1791, President Washington accepted <a href="United%20States%20Senator">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="John%20Brown%20%28Kentucky%29">John Brown</a>'s suggestion to appoint a Kentucky Board of War, composed of Brown, Scott, Isaac Shelby, <a href="Harry%20Innes">Harry Innes</a>, and Benjamin Logan. The committee was empowered to call out local militia to act in conjunction with federal troops against the Indians. They recommended assembling an army of volunteers to locate and destroy Indian settlements north of the Ohio River. Later that month, Washington approved a plan to invade the Indians' homelands via a raid from <a href="Fort%20Washington%2C%20Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Fort Washington</a> (near present-day <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>). Most Kentuckians were displeased with Washington's choice of Arthur St. Clair, by then suffering from <a href="gout">gout</a> and unable to mount his own horse unassisted, as overall commander of the invasion. Scott was chosen to serve under St. Clair as commander of the 1,000 militiamen who took part in the invasion, about one-third of the total force.

Washington ordered Scott to conduct a series of preliminary raids in mid-1791 that would keep the enemy occupied while St. Clair assembled the primary invasion force. Both Isaac Shelby and Benjamin Logan had hoped to lead the campaign, and neither would accept a lesser position. Shelby nevertheless supported the campaign, while Logan actively opposed it. Scott issued a call for volunteers to assemble at <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort, Kentucky</a>, on May15, 1791, to carry out these raids. Kentuckians responded favorably to the idea of an all-militia campaign, and 852 men volunteered for service, although Scott was only authorized to take 750; Senator John Brown was among the volunteers. After a brief delay to learn the fate of a failed diplomatic mission to the <a href="Miami%20people">Miami</a> tribes in the Northwest Territory, Scott's men departed from Fort Washington on May24. The militiamen crossed the Ohio toward a clutch of Miami, <a href="Kickapoo%20people">Kickapoo</a>, <a href="Wea">Wea</a>, and <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a> settlements near the location of present-day <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Indiana">Lafayette, Indiana</a>. For eight days, they crossed rugged terrain and were bedraggled by frequent rainstorms. The harsh conditions spoiled the militia's supplies, and they resorted to gathering the blackberries that were growing in the area; for this reason, the expedition earned the nickname the "Blackberry Campaign".

As Scott's men reached an open prairie near the Wea settlement of <a href="Fort%20Ouiatenon">Ouiatenon</a> on June1, they were discovered by an enemy scout and hurried to attack the villages before the residents could react. When the main force reached the villages, they found the residents hurriedly fleeing across the <a href="Wabash%20River">Wabash River</a> in canoes. Aided by cover fire from a Kickapoo village on the other side of the river, they were able to escape before Scott's men could attack. The river was too wide to ford at Scott's location, so he sent a detachment under James Wilkinson in one direction and a detachment under Thomas Barbee in the other to find a place to ford the river. Wilkinson did not find a suitable location, but located and killed a small band of Indians before returning. Barbee located a crossing and conducted a brief raid against the Indians on the other side before returning to Scott. The next morning, Scott's main force burned the nearby villages and crops, while a detachment under Wilkinson set out for the settlement of Kethtippecannunk. The inhabitants of this village had fled across <a href="Eel%20River%20%28Wabash%20River%29">Eel Creek</a>, and after a brief and ineffective firefight, Wilkinson's men burned the city and returned to Scott. In his official report, Scott noted that many of Kethtippecannunk's residents were French and speculated that it was connected to, perhaps dependent upon, the French settlement of <a href="Detroit%2C%20Michigan">Detroit</a>.

Low on supplies, Scott and his men ended their campaign. On the return trip, two men drowned in the <a href="White%20River%20%28Indiana%29">White River</a>; these were the only deaths among Scott's men. Five others were wounded but survived. In total, they had killed 38 Indians and taken 57 more prisoner. Scott sent 12 men ahead with the official report for Arthur St. Clair's review; the rest of the men arrived at Fort Steuben (present-day <a href="Clarksville%2C%20Indiana">Clarksville, Indiana</a>) on June15. The next day, they recrossed the Ohio River and received their discharge papers at <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>.

Scott's Wabash Campaign was well-received both in Kentucky and by the Washington administration. On June24, 1791, Arthur St. Clair encouraged the Board of War to organize a second expedition into the Wabash region and to remove their outposts along the Ohio River to free up manpower and finances as a prelude to his larger invasion. Scott questioned the wisdom of removing the outposts and convinced his fellow members of the Board of War to retain one at Big Bone Lick and one guarding an <a href="ironworks">ironworks</a> at the mouth of the Kentucky River. His instincts later proved to be right; a month later, Indian raiders tried to deny the frontier settlers access to salt by capturing Big Bone Lick, but they were repelled by the militia stationed at the outpost there. Scott also did not believe that 500 men, St. Clair's requested number for the second Wabash expedition, was sufficient for an effective operation.
In July, Scott gave permission to Bourbon County resident <a href="John%20Edwards%20%28Kentucky%29">John Edwards</a> to lead 300 men against a band of Indians suspected of stealing horses on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River. Although Edwards' expedition almost reached the <a href="Sandusky%20River">Sandusky River</a>, they found only deserted villages. Unknown to the volunteers, they narrowly missed being ambushed by the Indians in the area. Many of the men who accompanied Edwards accused him of cowardice. Due to illness, Scott was unable to lead the expedition St. Clair requested; instead, he chose his friend, James Wilkinson, to lead it. Wilkinson's men departed on August1. During their expedition, they destroyed the evacuated village of Kikiah (also called <a href="Battle%20of%20Kenapacomaqua">Kenapocomoco</a>), the rebuilt settlement of <a href="Ouiatenon">Ouiatenon</a>, a small Kickapoo village, and several other small settlements in the area. Returning by the same route that Scott's previous expedition had, Wilkinson's men were back in Kentucky by August21. Scott's and Wilkinson's campaigns took a heavy toll on the Northwest Indians. In particular, the and Kickapoos signed a peace treaty with the United States the following year, and the Kickapoos migrated farther into <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> and <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>.

St. Clair continued his preparations for invading the northwest despite the fact that, by now, he admitted he was unfit for combat due to his ill health. Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and Scott had to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition. He and most other officers in Kentucky claimed they were too ill to lead the men; most actually feared losing the respect of Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair. Colonel William Oldham was the highest-ranking soldier willing to lead the Kentuckians.

St. Clair's party left Fort Washington on October1. On November3, he ordered his men to make camp on a small tributary of the Wabash River, mistakenly believing they were camping on the <a href="St.%20Marys%20River%20%28Indiana%20and%20Ohio%29">St. Marys River</a>. His intent was for the men to construct some protective works the next day, but before sunrise, a combined group of Miami and <a href="Canada">Canadians</a> <a href="St.%20Clair%27s%20Defeat">attacked</a> the party, routing them and capturing part of their artillery and most of their supplies. Of St. Clair's force of 1,400 men, 600 were killed and 300 captured during the attack. The Kentucky militiamen scattered during the attack, and their leader, Colonel Oldham, was killed. Nevertheless, they and most citizens in Kentucky blamed St. Clair for the entire debacle. St. Clair retreated to Fort Washington, and on November24, Scott joined him there with 200 mounted volunteers in case the Indians decided to pursue him and invade Kentucky. When it became apparent that no Indian invasion was imminent, Scott's men returned home. As a result of St. Clair's campaign, tribes that had previously been neutral in the conflict – including the <a href="Lenape">Delawares</a> and <a href="Wyandot%20people">Wyandots</a> – allied with the Miami and Shawnee against the frontiersmen.

After <a href="St.%20Clair%27s%20Defeat">St. Clair's Defeat</a>, President Washington asked Congress to authorize the formation of the <a href="Legion%20of%20the%20United%20States">Legion of the United States</a>, a 5,000-man force to fight the Indians in the Northwest. Congress approved the proposal in March 1792, and Scott learned from a friend in Philadelphia that he was being considered as commander of the Legion. Ultimately Washington concluded that he was "of inadequate abilities"; his known vice of drinking too much alcohol also concerned Washington. Instead, Washington chose "Mad" Anthony Wayne to command the Legion. On June4, 1792 – just days after Kentucky officially gained statehood – the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> commissioned Scott and Benjamin Logan as major generals in the state militia. On June25, Scott was given command of the militia's 2nd Division, which was charged with operating north of the Kentucky River; Logan's 1st Division operated south of the river.

The new state legislature had also appointed a five-man committee to select a city to be the new <a href="state%20capital">state capital</a>. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities – including Frankfort, <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a>, Louisville, and <a href="Boonesborough%2C%20Kentucky">Boonesborough</a> – also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was chosen as a <a href="United%20States%20electoral%20college">presidential elector</a> in 1793.
Wayne originally intended to use Kentucky militiamen in preemptive strikes against the Indians and to conduct the main invasion using only federal troops, but by the time he moved to Fort Washington in mid-1793, he had assembled fewer than 3,000 of the 5,000 troops he had anticipated. He now requested that Scott's and Logan's men join his main force. Logan flatly refused to cooperate with a federal officer, but Scott eventually agreed, and Wayne commissioned him an officer in the federal army on July1, 1793. He and Governor Isaac Shelby instituted a draft to raise the 1,500 troops he was to command in Wayne's operation. When he joined Wayne at <a href="Fort%20Jefferson%20%28Ohio%29">Fort Jefferson</a> on October21, 1793, he had only been able to raise 1,000 men.

On November4, Wayne ordered Scott's militiamen to destroy a nearby Delaware village. Still resentful and distrustful of federal officers and aware that Wayne would not launch a major offensive so close to winter, the men were not enthusiastic about the mission, which many of them considered trivial. That night, 501 of them deserted their camp, though Wayne noted in his report that he believed Scott and his officers had done all they could do to prevent the desertions. Scott attempted to continue the mission with his remaining men, but inclement weather prevented him from conducting a major offensive. Ultimately, the men were only able to disperse a small hunting camp before continuing on to Fort Washington and mustering out on November10. Wayne ordered Scott to return with a full quota of troops after the winter.

Tensions cooled between Wayne and the Kentuckians over the winter of 1793–94. Wayne noticed that, despite their obstinance, the Kentucky volunteers appeared to be good soldiers. The militiamen, after observing Wayne, concluded that he – unlike Harmar and St. Clair – knew how to combat the Indians. Wayne augmented his popularity in Kentucky by building <a href="Fort%20Recovery">Fort Recovery</a> over the winter on the site of St. Clair's defeat. The Indians' victory over St. Clair had become a part of their lore and inspired them to continue the fight against the western settlers; Wayne's construction of a fort on this site was a blow to the Indian psyche, and his re-burial of some 600 skulls that the Indians had dug up and scattered across the area was popular with Kentuckians, since many of their own were among the dead. While Scott came to respect Wayne personally, his friend, James Wilkinson, began an anonymous campaign to tarnish Wayne's image, coveting command of the Northwest expedition for himself. Scott, on leave in Philadelphia at the time, wrote to <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Henry%20Knox">Henry Knox</a> to defend Wayne's reputation, breaching his friendship with Wilkinson.

Scott returned to Kentucky from Philadelphia in June 1794, mustered 1,500 militiamen, and joined Wayne at <a href="Greenville%2C%20Ohio">Fort Greeneville</a> on July27. He and Thomas Barbee led this force in support of Wayne's 1,000 regular troops. The combined force marched quickly and captured the recently evacuated Indian town of Grand Glaize on August8. Here, Wayne ordered the construction of <a href="Fort%20Defiance%20%28Ohio%29">Fort Defiance</a>, which took approximately a week. Scott was responsible for the naming of the fort; while observing its construction, he declared, "I defy the English, Indians, and all the devils in hell to take it." Based upon intelligence provided by Scott's mounted volunteers, Wayne ordered his force to march toward <a href="Fort%20Miami%20%28Ohio%29">Fort Miami</a> on August14, anticipating a battle with a combined British and Indian force of 2,400 there. About 8:45a.m. on August20, Major William Price's brigade of volunteers engaged the Indian force near Fort Miami, beginning the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fallen%20Timbers">Battle of Fallen Timbers</a>. The well-positioned Indian force turned back Price's men, but Wayne ordered his regulars to conduct a vigorous <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a> charge, which routed the Indians. Major William Campbell, the British commander of Fort Miami, refused to open the fort to his Indian allies, and Wayne's force won a decisive victory.

Following the battle, Wayne ordered Scott's volunteers to conduct numerous raids within a fifty-mile radius of their position. Due to a lack of pack horses in Wayne's force, the mounted volunteers were also employed transporting supplies between forts throughout September 1794. They eventually grew weary of garrison duty and complained that the use of their personal horses to transport goods had injured the animals. Many threatened to <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a> if not discharged. On October13, 1794, Wayne finally ordered them home. In a commendation of Wayne issued on December4, 1794, the U.S. House of Representatives specifically thanked Scott and his men for their service at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Greenville">Treaty of Greenville</a> formally ended the war in mid-1795.

In 1795, Scott traveled to Philadelphia to help clarify service records that would determine the final pay of the men who served under him before returning to his farm in Kentucky. He continued to serve, nominally, as major general of the 2nd militia division of the state militia until 1799. Celebrations of Scott's military heroism were held all over Kentucky, sparking his interest in a political career. With the advent of the <a href="First%20Party%20System">First Party System</a>, he declared himself a <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republican</a>, as did most Kentuckians. In 1800, he was chosen as a presidential elector for his district by a vote of 75 to 44 over <a href="Caleb%20Wallace">Caleb Wallace</a>. Scott and his fellow electors all cast their votes for the ticket of <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr</a>.

In 1803, Secretary of War <a href="Henry%20Dearborn">Henry Dearborn</a> appointed Scott and Governor <a href="James%20Garrard">James Garrard</a> to evaluate sites in Kentucky on which to construct a replacement for Fort Washington. Garrard, a central Kentucky native, insisted that the fort should be built at Frankfort. Scott disagreed, contending that the fort should not be in the state's interior and that the hilly terrain around Frankfort was unsuitable for constructing a fort. He waited several days for an appointment with Garrard to try and reach an agreement, but when he was unable to secure one, he asked Dearborn for permission to act alone. Dearborn granted the request and accepted Scott's recommendation of a site in <a href="Newport%2C%20Kentucky">Newport, Kentucky</a>. In 1804, Scott was again chosen a presidential elector with minimal opposition.

In 1797, Scott's son Daniel, who had settled in Virginia, died. In late 1799 or early 1800, his last son, Charles, Jr., also died. His daughter Martha married future U.S. Senator <a href="George%20M.%20Bibb">George M. Bibb</a> in 1799 and moved to <a href="Daviess%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Daviess County</a>. Daughter Mary had married and left the farm prior to Scott's return from military service, and youngest daughter Nancy left the farm near the turn of the 19th century, although she never married. After the death of his wife on October6, 1804, he moved in with his daughter and son-in-law, John and Mary Postlethwait, in Lexington. He sold his farm in Woodford County in October 1805.

As tensions between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated in the wake of the June22, 1807, <a href="Chesapeake%E2%80%93Leopard%20Affair">"Chesapeake"–"Leopard" Affair</a>, Scott applied to Governor Christopher Greenup to raise a mounted militia unit in anticipation of an outbreak of hostilities. Although Greenup granted the requested authorization, Scott remarried on July25, 1807, and never assembled the militia unit. His second wife, Judith Cary (Bell) Gist, was the 57-year-old widow of Colonel <a href="Nathaniel%20Gist">Nathaniel Gist</a>, who had been a prisoner of war with Scott during the Revolutionary War. After their marriage, they moved to Canewood, Gist's family's plantation in Bourbon and <a href="Clark%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Clark</a> counties.

As the celebrations in honor of Scott's military career continued across Kentucky, he began to consider the possibility of running for governor in 1808. By mid-1806, state senator <a href="Thomas%20Posey">Thomas Posey</a> and Lexington lawyer <a href="Thomas%20Todd">Thomas Todd</a> had already declared their candidacies. Posey had been chosen speaker pro tem of the state Senate and, with the death of <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="John%20Caldwell%20%28Kentucky%20politician%29">John Caldwell</a> in 1804, had assumed the role of acting lieutenant governor and presiding officer in the Senate. He subsequently lost his senatorial re-election bid, but continued to act as lieutenant governor and preside over the Senate. His opponents claimed that since he was no longer a member of the Senate, he was not qualified to act as lieutenant governor; additionally, they charged that he was sympathetic to the hated <a href="Federalist%20Party">Federalist Party</a>, even though he self-identified as a Democratic-Republican. Although he was not successfully unseated as the Senate's presiding officer, the controversy diminished his chances in the 1808 election. In 1807, Todd removed himself from contention as well, accepting Governor Greenup's appointment to the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>.

Posey's diminished candidacy and Todd's exit from the race left only one major impediment to Scott's potential candidacy. A movement began in Kentucky to draft former Governor Isaac Shelby as a candidate for another term. Known as "Old King's Mountain" for his heroic role in the Revolutionary War <a href="Battle%20of%20King%27s%20Mountain">Battle of King's Mountain</a>, Shelby could match Scott's military appeal, and as a former delegate to Kentucky's statehood and constitutional conventions and a former governor, his political experience far exceeded Scott's. Ultimately Shelby declined to run, and Scott officially declared his candidacy on February11, 1808. <a href="John%20Allen%20%28soldier%29">John Allen</a> had by then declared his candidacy and <a href="Green%20Clay">Green Clay</a>'s announcement followed Scott's by about a month. Scott's campaign was managed by his stepson-in-law, <a href="Jesse%20Bledsoe">Jesse Bledsoe</a>, a law professor at <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a>. Bledsoe was among the most able politicians in the state, though he preferred the role of "kingmaker" to that of candidate.

Allen and Clay, both lawyers by profession, were hurt by a general distrust of lawyers by the Kentucky electorate. Further, Allen had served as general counsel for <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr</a>, and several anonymous letters to the state's newspapers accused him of being privy to <a href="Burr%20conspiracy">Burr's alleged scheme to create an independent state in the southwest</a>. <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> was among those who vigorously defended Allen from the charges. Scott also frequently spoke in highly complimentary terms of Allen. As a legislator, Green Clay pushed for measures favorable to debtors; he consequently enjoyed strong support from settlers south of the <a href="Green%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Green River</a>, many of whom were <a href="Squatting">squatters</a> and land speculators who owed substantial debts to the state. To counter Scott's hero image, Clay supporters pointed to his service with <a href="George%20Rogers%20Clark">George Rogers Clark</a> in a 1782 expedition against the Shawnee, but the impact of this line of campaigning was minimal. As the most senior Revolutionary War officer in Kentucky, Scott became the recognized leader of the state's veterans' lobby. The <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a> celebrations held around the state just before the August1 election provided a boost for his campaign. On election day, he garnered 22,050 votes, compared to 8,430 votes for Allen and 5,516 votes for Clay.

Among Scott's first acts as governor was appointing Jesse Bledsoe as <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Secretary of State</a>. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first address to the legislature on December13, 1808. Later that winter, Scott was injured when he slipped on the icy steps of the <a href="Old%20Governor%27s%20Mansion%20%28Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky%29">governor's mansion</a>; the injury left him confined to crutches for the rest of his life and rendered him even more dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term as governor.

In domestic matters, Scott advocated increased salaries for public officials, economic development measures, and heavy punishments for persistent criminals. While he desired a tax code that would preclude the need for the state to borrow money, he encouraged legislators to keep taxes as low as possible. He also urged them to convert the militia into a youth army. The General Assembly routinely ignored his calls for reform but did pass a measure he advocated that allowed debtors a one-year stay on collection of their debts if they provided both <a href="Bond%20%28finance%29">bond</a> and <a href="Security%20interest">security</a>.

Scott frequently clashed with the legislature, including once when the Senate refused to confirm the appointment of Dr. Walter Brashear as lieutenant colonel commandant of the state militia's second regiment. The governor refused to nominate anyone else for the position, saying that Brashear was the best person for it, and he assumed the senators would not want to be sent a worse nomination. He employed his gubernatorial veto three times over the course of his tenure, but all three were overridden by the legislature. Measures creating <a href="Harrison%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Harrison County</a> and allowing squatters to purchase occupied land on more favorable terms were both vetoed because Scott felt that they had been passed too hastily to allow proper debate. Scott also vetoed the revocation of a pension granted to recently retired Kentucky Court of Appeals justice <a href="George%20Muter">George Muter</a>, because he felt it undermined citizens' confidence in the promises of their government.

Throughout his term, Scott was dogged by rumors of heavy drinking and frequent use of profanity. On one occasion, an unnamed individual believed his reputation had been injured by something Scott had said and challenged him to a <a href="duel">duel</a>. He ignored the challenge, after which the challenger threatened to expose him as a coward. Scott was supposed to have replied, "Post and be damned; but if you do, you will only post yourself a damned liar, and everybody else will say so." On another occasion, after reviewing a speech written for him by Bledsoe, the governor was said to have remarked, "Well, Mr. Bledsoe, I know you think you are a damned sight smarter than I am, and so you are in many respects; but this message as it is now, won't do at all; I'll be damned if it will." When Bledsoe asked what was wrong with the speech, he reportedly replied, "Why, damn it to hell, why don't you put a good solemn prayer at the end of it, and talk about Providence, and the protection of Heaven, and all that?" After the governor campaigned for <a href="Humphrey%20Marshall%20%28politician%29">Humphrey Marshall</a>'s opponent in the 1809 legislative elections, Marshall published an article in the "Western World" newspaper that accused him of appearing in front of the court house drunk on election day.

For most of Scott's tenure as governor, tensions between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated. Sentiment in favor of a U.S. declaration of war against the British was particularly strong in Kentucky. Most Kentuckians resented the replacement of the <a href="Embargo%20Act%20of%201807">Embargo Act of 1807</a> with the weaker <a href="Non-Intercourse%20Act%20%281809%29">Non-Intercourse Act of 1809</a> and <a href="Macon%27s%20Bill%20Number%202">Macon's Bill Number 2</a>. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay became the acknowledged leader of the <a href="war%20hawk">war hawk</a>s in Congress. During an address to the General Assembly on December4, 1810, Scott expressed little hope of peacefully resolving U.S. grievances against Great Britain. He reminded the General Assembly that France had also violated the United States' maritime rights and urged equal treatment of the two countries for their offenses.
In September 1811, <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>, then governor of <a href="Indiana%20Territory">Indiana Territory</a>, visited Kentucky and directed Colonel Samuel Wells to recruit Kentuckians for a new federal regiment then being formed by the authority of Secretary of War <a href="William%20Eustis">William Eustis</a>. Harrison had not applied to Scott for permission to recruit in the state, and many Kentuckians – from Scott's political enemy, Humphrey Marshall, to his trusted advisor, Jesse Bledsoe – perceived this as a slight to the governor. Ignoring Bledsoe's indignation, Scott refused to make an issue of the "faux pas" and instead became one of the staunchest supporters of Harrison's rising career.

In November 1811, a messenger brought news to Kentucky of former <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">Kentucky Attorney General</a> <a href="Joseph%20Hamilton%20Daveiss">Joseph Hamilton Daveiss</a>'s death at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tippecanoe">Battle of Tippecanoe</a>, amplifying Kentuckians' outcry for war with the British and Indians. In anticipation of a federal call for volunteers, Scott published messages in the state's newspapers in February and April 1812 whipping up support for the impending war effort. By the end of July, the state's quota of 5,500 volunteers had been met. On August14, 1812, Scott greeted two regiments of soldiers at the governor's mansion just prior to their muster at <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Kentucky">Georgetown</a>. He hobbled among the soldiers with his crutch, then turned and hammered it against the mansion's steps and was heard to mutter "If it hadn't been for you, I could have gone with the boys myself."

On August25, 1812, Scott's last day in office, he appointed Harrison brevet major general over the Kentucky militia. The appointment was made on advice from incoming Governor Isaac Shelby and Henry Clay. The brevet ensured that Harrison, and not <a href="James%20Winchester">James Winchester</a> – who was unpopular in Kentucky and with his own troops – would lead the state's military forces in the war. Biographer Harry M. Ward noted that Harrison's commission was unconstitutional both because he was not a citizen of the state and because the state militia's allotment of major generals had already been filled. Kentucky historian <a href="Lowell%20H.%20Harrison">Lowell H. Harrison</a> concurred that the commission was "probably illegal", but further noted that it was "acclaimed across the state". The show of confidence from Scott and his aides influenced President <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> to appoint Harrison as supreme commander of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Northwest%20%28United%20States%29">Army of the Northwest</a>.

Following his term as governor, Scott retired to his Canewood estate with his wife and youngest step-daughter, Mary Cecil Gist. Two of his stepdaughters had married during his term as governor. In 1809, Anna Maria Gist married Captain <a href="Nathaniel%20G.%20S.%20Hart">Nathaniel G. S. Hart</a>, who was killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Frenchtown">River Raisin Massacre</a> in January 1813. Eliza Violet Gist married <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair">Francis Preston Blair</a> on July21, 1812, just prior to the expiration of Scott's term as governor. The governor opined that Blair, who was slightly built, stoop-shouldered, and suffering from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, would leave Eliza a widow within six months. Blair survived the tuberculosis and went on to become a trusted advisor to President <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>. He outlived Scott's prediction for him by more than sixty years.

By mid-1813, Scott's health had begun to fail rapidly. He died on October22, 1813, and was buried on the grounds of Canewood. At the time of his death, he was one of the last surviving generals of the Revolutionary War. His remains were re-interred at <a href="Frankfort%20Cemetery">Frankfort Cemetery</a> in 1854. <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Scott County, Kentucky</a>, and <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Indiana">Scott County, Indiana</a>, are named in his honor, as are the cities of <a href="Scottsville%2C%20Kentucky">Scottsville, Kentucky</a>, and <a href="Scottsville%2C%20Virginia">Scottsville, Virginia</a>.

2nd Red Banner Army

The 2nd Red Banner Army () was a <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> <a href="field%20army">field army</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> that served as part of the <a href="Far%20Eastern%20Front">Far Eastern Front</a>.

The army was formed at <a href="Khabarovsk">Khabarovsk</a> in the <a href="Soviet%20Far%20East">Soviet Far East</a> in 1938 as the 2nd Army. After the Far Eastern Front was split in September that year it became the 2nd Independent Red Banner Army. When the front was reformed in June 1940, the army was redesignated as the 2nd Red Banner Army, stationed in the <a href="Blagoveshchensk">Blagoveshchensk</a> area. It spent the bulk of World War II guarding the border in that area, sending formations to the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a> while undergoing several reorganizations. In August 1945, the army fought in the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Manchuria">Soviet invasion of Manchuria</a>, capturing the Japanese fortified regions of <a href="Aihun">Aihun</a> and <a href="Sunwu%2C%20Heilongjiang">Sunwu</a> adjacent to its sector of the border, and advancing into Manchuria to <a href="Qiqihar">Qiqihar</a>. The army was disbanded after the war in late 1945.

Due to increased tensions with Japan, the 2nd Army was created in July 1938 on the Far Eastern frontiers of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> from the <a href="18th%20Rifle%20Corps">18th Rifle Corps</a> as part of the <a href="Far%20Eastern%20Front">Far Eastern Red Banner Front</a>. It was commanded by then-"<a href="Komkor">Komkor</a>" (Corps commander) <a href="Ivan%20Konev">Ivan Konev</a>. In September, the front was dissolved and its troops were split into two independent armies, which both inherited the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Red%20Banner">Order of the Red Banner</a> previously awarded to the front. The army, redesignated as the 2nd Independent Red Banner Army (2nd OKA), still under Konev's command, was headquartered at <a href="Khabarovsk">Khabarovsk</a> and controlled troops in the <a href="oblast">oblast</a>s of <a href="Lower%20Amur%20Oblast">the Lower Amur</a>, <a href="Khabarovsk%20Oblast">Khabarovsk</a>, <a href="Primorski%20Oblast">Primorsky</a>, <a href="Sakhalin%20Oblast">Sakhalin</a>, and <a href="Kamchatka%20Oblast">Kamchatka</a>, the <a href="Jewish%20Autonomous%20Oblast">Jewish Autonomous Oblast</a>, and the <a href="okrug">okrug</a>s of <a href="Koryak%20Okrug">Koryak</a> and <a href="Chukotka%20Autonomous%20Okrug">Chukotka</a>. It was directly subordinate to the <a href="Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">People's Commissariat of Defense</a> and operationally controlled the <a href="Amur%20Military%20Flotilla">Amur Red Banner Flotilla</a>. The 2nd OKA included the <a href="3rd%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">3rd</a>, <a href="12th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">12th</a>, <a href="34th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">34th</a>, <a href="35th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">35th</a>, <a href="69th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">69th</a>, and <a href="78th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">78th Rifle Division</a>s during its existence, as well as the <a href="fortified%20region">fortified region</a>s of De-Kastri, Lower Amur, Ust-Sungari and Blagoveshchensk.

Elements of the army fought in the <a href="Battles%20of%20Khalkhin%20Gol">Battles of Khalkhin Gol</a>, a series of border clashes between the Soviet Union and Japan, in mid-1939 under the control of other formations. On 4 October 1939, the Northern Army Group was established at <a href="Nikolayevsk-on-Amur">Nikolayevsk-on-Amur</a>, controlling troops in the fortified regions of Nikolayevsk-on-Amur and De-Kastri, <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka</a> and <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a>. Subordinated to the 2nd OKA, the group operationally controlled the <a href="Northern%20Pacific%20Flotilla">Northern Pacific Flotilla</a>. By an order dated 21 June 1940, the Far Eastern Front was recreated and the headquarters of the 2nd Independent Red Banner Army was abolished and used to form the headquarters of the 2nd and <a href="15th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">15th Armies</a>. The 2nd (<a href="Blagoveshchensk">Blagoveshchensk</a>) Red Banner Army (2nd KA) was headquartered at <a href="Belogorsk%2C%20Amur%20Oblast">Kuibyshevka</a>. It included the 3rd and 12th Rifle Divisions and the 69th Motorized Division (the former 69th Rifle Division, stationed in the Blagoveshchensk area). The 34th, 35th, and 78th Rifle Divisions became part of the 15th Army. Lieutenant General <a href="Vsevolod%20Sergeyev">Vsevolod Sergeyev</a> became army commander on 22 June. On 27 August, the <a href="31st%20Mixed%20Aviation%20Division">31st Mixed Aviation Division</a> (SmAD) was formed from its 26th Mixed Aviation Brigade. In March 1941, the <a href="59th%20Tank%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">59th Tank Division</a> was formed in the Khabarovsk area as part of the army. Lieutenant General <a href="Makar%20Teryokhin">Makar Teryokhin</a> replaced Sergeyev on 11 March. By 22 June the army also included the 101st Blagoveshchensk and the Ust-Bureysk Fortified Regions. 

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the army covered the border around Blagoveshchensk and sent reinforcements to the active forces fighting on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a>. Following the beginning of <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a>, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941, a directive dated 25 June transferred the 59th Tank and 69th Motorized Divisions by rail to the Eastern Front. On 28 June the 31st SmAD departed for the Eastern Front, and remaining units, including the <a href="534th%20Fighter%20Aviation%20Regiment">3rd Fighter Aviation Regiment</a>, were made directly subordinate to the Air Force (VVS) of the 2nd KA. In August the 95th Mixed Aviation Division was formed in the VVS of the 2nd KA; it became the <a href="95th%20Fighter%20Aviation%20Division">95th Fighter Aviation Division</a> (IAD) by 1 September. 

By 1 September, the army included the <a href="Svobodny%2C%20Amur%20Oblast">Svobodny</a> Rifle Division, and the <a href="82nd%20Bomber%20Aviation%20Division">82nd Bomber Aviation Division</a> (BAD) had been added to the VVS of the 2nd KA. By 1 October the Svobodny Rifle Division had been replaced by the <a href="204th%20Rifle%20Division">204th Rifle Division</a>, the 95th IAD had become the 95th SmAD, and the <a href="96th%20Mixed%20Aviation%20Division">96th SmAD</a> had been created. By 1 November, the 1st and 2nd Rifle Brigades and the <a href="Zeya%2C%20Russia">Zeya</a> and Blagoveshchensk separate rifle <a href="regiment">regiment</a>s had been formed in the army. The 95th SmAD had again been redesignated as the 95th IAD by 1 December, and a separate cavalry regiment and the <a href="73rd%20Tank%20Brigade">73rd</a> and <a href="74th%20Tank%20Brigade">74th</a> Tank Brigades had been formed. As of 1 December the two separate rifle regiments had disappeared from the order of battle and the 1st and 2nd Rifle Brigades were shown as being part of the 101st Fortified Region.

The Ust-Bureysk Fortified Region was likely disbanded in December, as it does not appear in the order of battle for 1 January 1942. The 95th IAD became an SmAD again in December. In January the 82nd BAD briefly transferred to the VVS of the Far Eastern Front, but transferred back to the army's VVS in February. Around the same time the <a href="96th%20Rifle%20Division">96th Rifle Division</a> and 258th and 259th Rifle Brigades became part of the army. In March the 95th SmAD was disbanded and its units directly subordinated to the army's VVS. The 96th SmAD was converted into an IAD in May. In July, the 96th and 204th Rifle Divisions were shipped to the Eastern Front and the 17th and 41st Rifle Brigades were formed. The VVS of the army became a separate unit, the <a href="11th%20Air%20Army">11th Air Army</a>, in August.

In April 1943, the 1st and 2nd Amur Tank Brigades were formed in the army from its separate tank <a href="Battalion">battalions</a>; in June, the 1st was merged into the 2nd, becoming the <a href="258th%20Tank%20Brigade">258th Tank Brigade</a> in July. The army's composition remained constant for most of 1944; the <a href="342nd%20Rifle%20Division">342nd</a> and <a href="355th%20Rifle%20Division">355th Rifle Divisions</a> were formed in the army in late November and December, respectively, from its four rifle brigades. The <a href="345th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">345th</a> and the <a href="396th%20Rifle%20Division">396th Rifle Division</a>s were formed in the army in March 1945. In July, the 342nd and the 345th Divisions transferred out of the army to the <a href="87th%20Rifle%20Corps">87th Rifle Corps</a> and the 355th Division joined the <a href="Chuguyevka%20Operational%20Group">Chuguyevka Operational Group</a>, an independent unit directly controlled by the Far Eastern Front headquarters.

In preparation for the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Manchuria">Soviet invasion of Manchuria</a>, the army became part of the <a href="2nd%20Far%20Eastern%20Front">2nd Far Eastern Front</a> after the Far Eastern Front was split on 5 August. For the invasion, the army had a strength of 240 tanks and self-propelled guns and 1,270 guns and mortars, and occupied a sector. It numbered 54,000 men out of a nominal strength of 59,000. The army's three rifle divisions were at around 90% of their nominal strength, with around 9,000 to 10,000 men each; the 3rd and 12th Divisions were slightly larger than the 396th. The 101st Fortified Region numbered 6,000 men and was almost at full strength. The army included three tank brigades (the 73rd, 74th, and 258th) and three <a href="self-propelled%20artillery">self-propelled artillery</a> battalions. Front commander <a href="Army%20General%20%28Soviet%20rank%29">Army General</a> <a href="Maxim%20Purkayev">Maxim Purkayev</a> initially tasked the army with defending the Blagoveshchensk area from Japanese attack, in cooperation with the Amur Flotilla's Zee-Bureysk Brigade and separate battalions of river ships. When the main Soviet attacks achieved success, the army was to launch an assault crossing of the <a href="Amur%20River">Amur River</a>, reduce or isolate the Japanese <a href="Heihe">Sakhalian</a>, <a href="Aihun">Aihun</a>, and <a href="Holomoching">Holomoching</a> fortified regions and defenses around <a href="Sunwu%2C%20Heilongjiang">Sunwu</a>, and advance south through the <a href="Lesser%20Khingan">Lesser Khingan</a> Mountains to <a href="Qiqihar">Qiqihar</a> and <a href="Harbin">Harbin</a>. The front's offensive operations were later known in Soviet historiography as the <a href="Sungari%20Offensive">Sungari Offensive</a>.

An operational group consisting of the 3rd and 12th Rifle Divisions and the 73rd and 74th Tank Brigades was positioned in the army's center and on its left flank. It was to attack south across the Amur from Konstantinovka to capture Sunwu and its fortifications, then advance south through <a href="Bei%27an">Peian</a> to Harbin. Another group with the 396th Rifle Division, the 368th Mountain Rifle Regiment, and the 258th Tank Brigade was to launch a supporting drive across the Amur from the Blagoveshchensk area, take the fortified regions of Sakhalian and Aihun, and advance south to <a href="Nenjiang%20County">Nencheng</a>, Noho, and Qiqihar. The army's 101st Fortified Area, with <a href="artillery">artillery</a> and machine gun battalions, was positioned on the Amur between the two groups to conduct supporting attacks.

The main offensive began on 9 August, but the army remained in its positions until 11 August. During this time, it conducted <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> and harassing attacks across the Amur, capturing several of the river's islands. The main bodies of the operational groups were placed in concentration areas, located in the army's rear. Due to the rapid advance of the other Soviet forces, Purkayev ordered the army late on 10 August to begin its attack early on the following morning. Aihun, Sunwu, and Hsunho were scheduled to be captured by the end of 11 August. That night, the operational groups moved forward to their attack starting positions. The attack began early in the morning under the cover of an artillery bombardment, as reconnaissance and assault detachments from the first echelons of the operational groups crossed the Amur, capturing bridgeheads near Sakhalian, Aihun, and Holomoching, coming into contact with Japanese outposts and covering forces. The 3rd and 12th Rifle Divisions commenced crossing the river shortly afterwards, less one regiment, east and west of Konstantinovka; the 396th Division and 368th Regiment near Blagoveshchensk and the 101st Fortified Region crossed south of Blagoveshchensk.

Due to bridging equipment shortages, the army was not fully across the river until 16 August, forcing the piecemeal commitment of forces. Forward units continued to engage Japanese advanced positions south of Holomoching and north of Aihun on 12 August, as reinforcements landed. Sufficient troops to intensify the attack had arrived on the other bank of the Amur by 13 August, allowing the 3rd Rifle Division and 74th Tank Brigade to penetrate the Japanese defenses held by the <a href="123rd%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">123rd Infantry Division</a>'s 269th Infantry Regiment on the heights northeast of Sunwu. A regiment from the 12th Division crossed the Amur east of Sunwu and advanced west along the Sunwu road, attacking the Japanese left flank. The 396th Division, 258th Tank Brigade and 368th Regiment pushed the <a href="135th%20Independent%20Mixed%20Brigade">135th Independent Mixed Brigade</a> back towards the main fortified region at Aihun, while small Japanese forces were destroyed by troops crossing the river father north at Huma and Santaoka.

Fierce fighting took place on 14 and 15 August for the main fortified regions east and north of Sunwu. Supported by the 73rd Tank Brigade, the 3rd and 12th Divisions broke through Japanese defenses at Shenwutan, scattering a detachment from the 269th Regiment, and driving another back towards Nanyang Hill, just east of Sunwu, and attacking the 123rd Division's main forces in the Sunwu Fortified Region. Meanwhile, the 74th Tank Brigade, reinforced by a rifle <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a>, artillery battalion, and an <a href="Anti-tank%20gun">antitank</a> regiment, moved south and bypassed Sunwu, advancing to cut the Sunwu–Peian road. Taking advantage of the tank attack, the 396th Division and 368th Regiment advanced on Sunwu from the north, surrounding most of the 135th Brigade in the Aihun Fortified Region. A forward detachment was formed around the 74th Brigade to pursue the Japanese remnants southwest along the Nencheng road.

The 369th Rifle Division's second echelon 614th Rifle Regiment and the 101st Fortified Region were tasked with reducing the Aihun and Sunwu fortified regions, as the operational groups marched in two routes towards Nencheng and Peian, more than 93 miles (150 kilometers) apart. The advance was slowed by bad weather and muddy and rutted roads, and two <a href="Sapper">engineer sapper</a> battalions were attached to the lead detachments of the operational groups to speed up the advance. For the next several days, the bypassed Japanese troops continued to defend the Sakhalian, Aihun and Sunwu fortified regions, launching frequent attacks against the Soviet troops. After further heavy artillery and bombing from the Soviet <a href="18th%20Mixed%20Aviation%20Corps">18th Mixed Aviation Corps</a> of the <a href="10th%20Air%20Army">10th Air Army</a>, Japanese resistance slackened on 17 and 18 August, and many defenders surrendered or were destroyed. Around Sunwu, a total of 17,061 Japanese military personnel were captured, while 4,520 soldiers at Aihun did not surrender until 20 August.

The <a href="Kwantung%20Army">Kwantung Army</a> formally surrendered on 18 August, while the operational groups slowly advanced south, capturing Nencheng and Peian on 20 and 21 August before moving towards Qiqihar and Harbin. The army reached Qiqihar on 21 August, where it linked up with troops from the <a href="36th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">36th Army</a>. The Japanese around the fortified regions were subsequently described by historian <a href="David%20Glantz">David Glantz</a> as the most formidable faced by Soviet troops in the campaign. The level of resistance and road conditions slowed the army's advance to an average of 20 kilometers a day, one of the lowest speeds of Soviet forces during the invasion; it advanced a depth of 200 kilometers into Manchuria. During the campaign, the army lost 645 killed, 1,817 wounded, and 74 missing.

The <a href="390th%20Rifle%20Division">390th Rifle Division</a> of the <a href="5th%20Rifle%20Corps">5th Separate Rifle Corps</a> was transferred to the army by 3 September 1945, along with the <a href="32nd%20Guards%20Tank%20Brigade">32nd Guards Tank Brigade</a>. After the war, the army briefly became part of the <a href="Far%20Eastern%20Military%20District">Far Eastern Military District</a>, formed from the 2nd Far Eastern Front on 10 September. It was disbanded there in November 1945, the headquarters officially dissolving on 15 December. The 390th and 396th Divisions were disbanded with the army, while the 3rd and 12th Divisions transferred to the <a href="26th%20Rifle%20Corps">26th Rifle Corps</a> of the <a href="1st%20Red%20Banner%20Army">1st Red Banner Army</a> in the <a href="Transbaikal-Amur%20Military%20District">Transbaikal-Amur Military District</a>.

The army was commanded by the following officers during its existence:

New York State Route 22

New York State Route 22 (NY 22) is a north–south <a href="state%20highway">state highway</a> that parallels the eastern border of the U.S. state of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, from the outskirts of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to the hamlet of <a href="Mooers%20%28CDP%29%2C%20New%20York">Mooers</a> in <a href="Clinton%20County%2C%20New%20York">Clinton County</a> near the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canadian border</a>. At , it is the state's longest north–south route and the third longest state route overall, after <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%205">NY 5</a> and <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2017">NY 17</a>. Many of the state's major east–west roads intersect with, and often <a href="Concurrency%20%28road%29">join</a>, Route 22 just before crossing into the neighboring <a href="New%20England">New England</a> states, where <a href="U.S.%20Route%207">U.S. Route 7</a> (US 7), which originally partially followed NY 22's alignment, similarly parallels the New York state line.

Almost all of Route 22 is a two-lane rural road through small villages and hamlets. The exceptions are its southern end in the heavily populated <a href="Bronx">Bronx</a> and lower <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a>, and a section that runs through the city of <a href="Plattsburgh%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">Plattsburgh</a> near the northern end. The rural landscape that the road passes through varies from horse country and views of the reservoirs of the <a href="New%20York%20City%20water%20supply%20system">New York City watershed</a> in the northern suburbs of the city, to <a href="dairy%20farm">dairy farm</a>s further <a href="Upstate%20New%20York">upstate</a> in the <a href="Taconic%20Mountains">Taconic</a> and <a href="Berkshire%20Mountains">Berkshire</a> mountains, to the undeveloped, heavily forested <a href="Adirondack%20Park">Adirondack Park</a> along the shores of <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>. An section from <a href="Fort%20Ann%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Fort Ann</a> to <a href="Keeseville%2C%20New%20York">Keeseville</a> is part of the <a href="All-American%20Road">All-American Road</a> known as the <a href="Lakes%20to%20Locks%20Passage">Lakes to Locks Passage</a>.

The oldest portions of today's Route 22, in Westchester County and along the Lake Champlain shoreline, were <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> trails. <a href="New%20Netherland">Dutch</a>, and after them English, settlers continued to use the road to get their farm products to market, with the southernmost portion eventually becoming the White Plains Post Road in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the early 20th century, as automobile use became widespread, the state paved the more heavily used sections and built new roads to create the current highway, first designated as Route 22 in 1930. In its early years the highway began in <a href="Manhattan%2C%20New%20York">Manhattan</a>; until 2008 its northern end was the Canadian border.

Route 22 starts as an urban arterial road, passing through the most populous communities along its route within its first . After running northerly from its origin in the Bronx it veers slightly to the northeast in the vicinity of a <a href="traffic%20circle">traffic circle</a> near <a href="Kensico%20Reservoir">Kensico Dam</a> before heading northward for good as a mostly two-lane rural route all the way to the state's <a href="North%20Country%20%28New%20York%29">North Country</a>.

The majority of NY 22's routing is maintained by the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Department%20of%20Transportation">New York State Department of Transportation</a> (NYSDOT); however, several sections are maintained by other jurisdictions. The southernmost of these is in <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>, where the entirety of the highway within the <a href="borough%20%28New%20York%20City%29">borough</a> is maintained by the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Transportation">New York City Department of Transportation</a> (NYCDOT). In <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a>, Route 22 is mostly locally maintained within the city of <a href="Mount%20Vernon%2C%20New%20York">Mount Vernon</a> and is county-maintained within the city of <a href="White%20Plains%2C%20New%20York">White Plains</a>. In <a href="Clinton%20County%2C%20New%20York">Clinton County</a>, the route is locally maintained within the <a href="Plattsburgh%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">city of Plattsburgh</a>.

During its course, NY 22 intersects or <a href="Concurrency%20%28road%29">runs concurrently</a> with 46 other designated routes: one <a href="Parkways%20in%20New%20York">state parkway</a>, five <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highways</a>, and seven <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">U.S. Highways</a> not counting its own termini. Of the surface road intersections, 18 terminate at Route 22 and 15 are concurrencies shared with the crossing routes, accounting for , or 21.5% of the highway's total length.

Route 22 starts as Provost Avenue at an intersection with <a href="U.S.%20Route%201%20in%20New%20York">U.S. Route 1</a> (US 1) in the <a href="Eastchester%2C%20Bronx">Eastchester</a> section of <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>, intersecting with <a href="East%20233rd%20Street%20%28Bronx%29">East 233rd Street</a> about to the north. It soon crosses the <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester</a> county line into <a href="Mount%20Vernon%2C%20New%20York">Mount Vernon</a> and becomes South Third Avenue, beginning a section in that county. Shortly after the county line, Route 22 makes a sharp turn to the east at the South Columbus Avenue intersection, soon passing <a href="St.%20Paul%27s%20Church%20National%20Historic%20Site">St. Paul's Church National Historic Site</a> on its north, then curving back to that direction. It parallels the nearby <a href="Hutchinson%20River%20Parkway">Hutchinson River Parkway</a> as it passes through the suburbs of <a href="Bronxville%2C%20New%20York">Bronxville</a> and <a href="Tuckahoe%2C%20Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Tuckahoe</a>. At Wilson Woods Lake, it crosses under a railroad bridge on the <a href="Metro-North%20Railroad">Metro-North</a> <a href="New%20Haven%20Line">New Haven Line</a> and becomes North Columbus Avenue, then has its first interchange with a <a href="limited-access%20road">limited-access road</a> at the <a href="Cross%20County%20Parkway">Cross County Parkway</a>.

<a href="Country%20club">Country club</a>s on either side bracket NY 22's entry into <a href="Eastchester%2C%20New%20York">Eastchester</a>. It makes a turn to the northeast, passing the Vernon Hills Shopping Center to the right. After leaving Eastchester, NY 22 continues north into the village of <a href="Scarsdale%2C%20New%20York">Scarsdale</a>. Paralleling the <a href="Bronx%20River%20Parkway">Bronx River Parkway</a> (BRP), enters Westchester's <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a>, <a href="White%20Plains%2C%20New%20York">White Plains</a>. NY 22 also intersects <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20125">NY 125</a> and <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20119">NY 119</a> in downtown White Plains, then bends to the northwest along North Broadway, eventually intersecting the <a href="Cross-Westchester%20Expressway">Cross-Westchester Expressway</a> (<a href="Interstate%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B287">Interstate 287</a> or I-287). The <a href="White%20Plains%20Rural%20Cemetery">White Plains Rural Cemetery</a> is visible to the west as Route 22 continues northward out of the city. In <a href="North%20White%20Plains%2C%20New%20York">North White Plains</a>, the surrounding area becomes less developed as it goes over a gentle rise from which a short connector runs downhill to the <a href="traffic%20circle">traffic circle</a> where the BRP ends and the <a href="Taconic%20State%20Parkway">Taconic State Parkway</a> begins, just south of <a href="Kensico%20Dam">Kensico Dam</a>.

While the Taconic State Parkway continues along the northwest heading Route 22 had been following, Route 22 itself veers to the northeast along the reservoir's south shore. After crossing a small bridge over one of the reservoir's bays, NY 22 becomes a four-lane divided highway and begins a thousand-foot (() <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrency</a>, the first of 15 along its length, with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20120">NY 120</a>. The combined roads pass just west of <a href="IBM">IBM</a>'s <a href="Armonk%2C%20New%20York">Armonk</a> headquarters and the "Duke's Trees angle", the westernmost point in <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. For the first time, NY 22 runs parallel to New York's eastern border, intersecting <a href="Interstate%20684">I-684</a> for the first of several times just north of the short portion of that highway in Connecticut, after which NY 22 reverts to two lanes. A short distance later, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20433">NY 433</a>, one of the state's shortest highways, heads south from NY 22 into <a href="Greenwich%2C%20Connecticut">Greenwich</a>.

After that junction, NY 22 bends back to the north, paralleling I-684 as a narrow, shaded meandering two-lane rural route through the Westchester countryside of large wooded lots and houses well-screened from the road. In downtown <a href="Bedford%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Bedford</a>, the first settlement since White Plains, the highway overlaps with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20172">NY 172</a> for a mile (1.6 km), its first concurrency with an east-west route, then veers back to the northwest at the center of town. Just to the north, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20121">NY 121</a>, the only north–south state highway whose route is entirely east of NY 22, forks off from its southern terminus. Another mile past that, Route 22 returns to a due-north heading, passing the <a href="John%20Jay%20Homestead%20State%20Historic%20Site">John Jay Homestead State Historic Site</a> a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>, where it turns west briefly, and <a href="Harvey%20School">Harvey School</a>, where it curves to the northwest again. After the <a href="Katonah%20Museum%20of%20Art">Katonah Museum of Art</a> it widens briefly at a major intersection with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2035">NY 35</a>. north of that junction, NY 22 becomes parallel with I-684 into the <a href="Somers%2C%20New%20York">Town of Somers</a> and the hamlet of <a href="Goldens%20Bridge%2C%20New%20York">Goldens Bridge</a>. On the other side of the Interstate, accessible via <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20138">NY 138</a>, is the <a href="Goldens%20Bridge%20%28Metro-North%20station%29">Goldens Bridge station</a> on <a href="Metro-North%20Railroad">Metro-North Railroad</a>'s <a href="Harlem%20Line">Harlem Line</a>, which begins a long parallel alignment with NY 22 at this point.
The railroad's <a href="Purdy%27s%20%28Metro-North%20station%29">Purdy's</a> station is a short distance west of the next junction, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20116">NY 116</a>. At another traffic light to the north, NY 116 goes east to <a href="Titicus%20Reservoir">Titicus Reservoir</a> at the northern intersection, the highway crosses under I-684, remaining between it and the railroad tracks. Just past the Interstate, Route 22 turns west onto Hardscrabble Road, which soon turns north again to follow the tracks to <a href="Croton%20Falls%20%28Metro-North%20station%29">the next station</a>, <a href="North%20Salem%2C%20New%20York">North Salem</a>'s hamlet of <a href="Croton%20Falls%2C%20New%20York">Croton Falls</a>. Just north of the hamlet, Route 22 crosses under the tracks, and is joined by <a href="U.S.%20Route%20202%20in%20New%20York">US 202</a>. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters <a href="Putnam%20County%2C%20New%20York">Putnam County</a>, following the <a href="Croton%20River">Croton River</a> north past the <a href="spillway">spillway</a> of <a href="East%20Branch%20Reservoir">East Branch Reservoir</a>.

After paralleling the reservoir for almost , a third route, <a href="U.S.%20Route%206%20in%20New%20York">US 6</a>, joins the concurrency just east of the village of <a href="Brewster%2C%20New%20York">Brewster</a>, forming the only three-route overlap along Route 22. The three routes cross under a high, long bridge carrying <a href="Interstate%2084%20in%20New%20York">I-84</a>, then veer east to an interchange with the north end of I-684. US 6 and 202 continue east for <a href="Danbury%2C%20Connecticut">Danbury</a> while NY 22 uses the northbound on-ramp of the I-684 roadway. The next thousand feet (300 m) of Route 22, along the brief extension of I-684, is the highway's only expressway section; the roadways merge and narrow to two lanes after they cross the Croton's East Branch.

Route 22 continues heading northeast along a narrow strip of land between the East Branch and <a href="Bog%20Brook%20Reservoir">Bog Brook</a> reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course than it had up to this point, on two lanes through wooded areas of the town of <a href="Patterson%2C%20New%20York">Patterson</a>, where two local state highways, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20312">NY 312</a> and <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20164">164</a>, come in from the west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20311">NY 311</a>, and passing another strip plaza, NY 22 crosses into <a href="Dutchess%20County%2C%20New%20York">Dutchess County</a>.

After another supermarket strip to the east, a long, gentle <a href="divided%20highway">divided</a> bend in the road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2055">NY 55</a> comes in from the west. It joins NY 22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of <a href="Pawling%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Pawling</a> and then by <a href="Trinity-Pawling%20School">Trinity-Pawling School</a>. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY 22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, near the lower end of the <a href="Taconic%20Mountains">Taconic Mountains</a>. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. from Pawling, the <a href="Appalachian%20Trail">Appalachian Trail</a> crosses the road next to the line's <a href="Appalachian%20Trail%20%28Metro-North%20station%29">similarly named station</a>.

Routes 22 and 55 continue their long curve into the town of <a href="Dover%2C%20New%20York">Dover</a>, past the <a href="Harlem%20Valley%E2%80%93Wingdale%20%28Metro-North%20station%29">Harlem Valley–Wingdale</a> station next to the road across from the now-closed buildings of <a href="Harlem%20Valley%20State%20Hospital">Harlem Valley Psychiatric Center</a>. The NY 55 concurrency ends when that road forks off east towards Connecticut at the hamlet of <a href="Wingdale%2C%20New%20York">Wingdale</a>. The road continues through <a href="Dover%20Plains%20%28Metro-North%20station%29">Dover Plains</a> and into <a href="Amenia%2C%20New%20York">Amenia</a>, where an overlap with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20343">NY 343</a> begins. The railroad line ends at <a href="Wassaic%20%28Metro-North%20station%29">Wassaic</a>. Route 343 remains joined with Route 22 into <a href="Amenia%20%28CDP%29%2C%20New%20York">the hamlet of Amenia</a>, where it separates and heads towards <a href="Sharon%2C%20Connecticut">Sharon, Connecticut</a>. At the same junction, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2044%20in%20New%20York">US 44</a> comes in from <a href="Millbrook%2C%20New%20York">Millbrook</a> to begin an overlap with Route 22. The valley opens up as the southern <a href="Taconic%20Mountains">Taconics</a> loom ahead. Shortly after crossing into the Town of <a href="North%20East%2C%20New%20York">North East</a>, the highway passes by the large <a href="Coleman%20Station%20Historic%20District">Coleman Station Historic District</a>.

After intersecting with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20199">NY 199</a> at its eastern end, NY 22 and US 44 veer northeast into the small village of <a href="Millerton%2C%20New%20York">Millerton</a> in the northern protrusion of Dutchess County's Oblong, an area once the subject of a boundary dispute between New York and Connecticut in the late 17th century. US 44 continues eastward towards <a href="Lakeville%2C%20Connecticut">Lakeville, Connecticut</a>, only a mile (1.6 km) east at this point, while NY 22 resumes its northward course into the shadow of the ridge ahead, where <a href="Brace%20Mountain">Brace Mountain</a>, Dutchess County's highest peak, dominates the view. At another gentle curve, NY 22 slips into <a href="Columbia%20County%2C%20New%20York">Columbia County</a> and the town of <a href="Ancram%2C%20New%20York">Ancram</a>. North of the county line, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> becomes the state behind <a href="Alander%20Mountain">Alander Mountain</a> and the other peaks visible to the east. The southernmost route from New York to the Massachusetts state line, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20344">NY 344</a>, leaves for <a href="Bash%20Bish%20Falls">Bashbish Falls State Park</a> just west of the hamlet of <a href="Copake%20Falls%2C%20New%20York">Copake Falls</a>.

The next major junction is at <a href="Hillsdale%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Hillsdale</a>, where <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2023">NY 23</a>, the longest east–west state highway not to overlap with NY 22, intersects at a traffic light just east of downtown. At Green River, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2071">NY 71</a>, the state's shortest two-digit route, begins it short eastward course into Massachusetts. NY 22 then crosses into <a href="Austerlitz%2C%20New%20York">Austerlitz</a>, where the surrounding terrain becomes much more wooded and the valleys become narrower. In the center of town, the historic hamlet of Old Austerlitz, East Hill Road offers a short detour to <a href="Steepletop">Steepletop</a>, the farm where <a href="Edna%20St.%20Vincent%20Millay">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a> lived, another National Historic Landmark. A short distance later, NY 22 intersects with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20203">NY 203</a> at its eastern end.

Route 22 then veers sharply to the northeast, resuming a northward direction within of the state line, the highway's closest approach to it along its entire length. It then rounds a mountain and heads west, paralleling the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Thruway">New York State Thruway</a>'s Berkshire section (<a href="Interstate%2090%20in%20New%20York">I-90</a>) for a mile. <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20980D">NY 980D</a> (an unsigned reference route) leaves to the east, where it becomes <a href="Massachusetts%20Route%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B102">Massachusetts Route 102</a> at the state line. After Thruway exit B3, NY 22 resumes its northerly heading. From here it intersects <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20295">NY 295</a>, then passes <a href="Queechy%20Lake">Queechy Lake</a>. NY 22 then straightens out to reach <a href="New%20Lebanon%2C%20New%20York">New Lebanon</a>, where it intersects <a href="U.S.%20Route%2020%20in%20New%20York">US 20</a>. Ending a stretch with no concurrencies, the longest on Route 22, New York's longest east–west route (US 20) overlaps with its longest north–south route (NY 22) for a mile before the former continues to <a href="Pittsfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Pittsfield</a> and the latter returns to the border-paralleling course, which takes it into <a href="Rensselaer%20County%2C%20New%20York">Rensselaer County</a>.

As NY 22 continues north, it remains, at first, within a mile of Massachusetts, moving to the east to intersect with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2043">NY 43</a> in <a href="Stephentown%2C%20New%20York">Stephentown</a>. North of that junction, it begins to run through a deep, isolated, lightly populated valley in the New York section of the <a href="Berkshire%20Mountains">Berkshires</a>. Wide curves take the road through the town of <a href="Berlin%2C%20New%20York">Berlin</a>. Route 22 trends further west, then back east to where <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%202">NY 2</a> crosses via an overpass at <a href="Petersburgh%2C%20New%20York">Petersburgh</a> on its way to Petersburg Pass, the northernmost crossing of the New York–Massachusetts state line. The next road to head east from NY 22, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20346">NY 346</a> at North Petersburgh, enters <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>.

Shortly afterward, the highway descends gently from the Berkshires to meet another major east–west state road, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%207">NY 7</a>. After turning northeast to join it at a traffic light, NY 22 overlaps with Route 7 for , then forks off to the north just before crossing the <a href="Hoosic%20River">Hoosic River</a>. NY 22 follows the river for to <a href="Hoosick%20Falls%2C%20New%20York">Hoosick Falls</a>, the first village it has passed through since Millerton. There are no other state routes here, but after another , at North Hoosick, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2067">NY 67</a> comes in from the east and the two roads overlap as they leave Rensselaer County.

The next of Route 22 traverse <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20New%20York">Washington County</a>, the longest portion of the highway in a single county. Almost immediately after the joined roads cross the line, NY 67 splits off to the west, crossing the Hoosick back into Rensselaer County, while NY 22 straightens out again to go due north. After , it reaches <a href="Cambridge%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Cambridge</a>, where <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20313">NY 313</a> forks off to the east. In the middle of town, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20372">NY 372</a>, a local connector to <a href="Greenwich%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Greenwich</a>, ends.
North of Cambridge, the highway continues through a rolling landscape of fields and farms, the low transitional country between the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachians</a> and the <a href="Adirondack%20Mountains">Adirondacks</a>. Beyond <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2029">NY 29</a>'s eastern terminus at Greenwich Junction, Route 22 heads eastward again through of countryside until, just before reaching <a href="Granville%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Granville</a>, it comes within of the state line, the closest it has come to that boundary since Austerlitz. At the village's south end, NY 22 intersects <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20149">NY 149</a> and the two routes overlap for until Route 149 begins its short journey to Vermont. Just north of Granville, the first of NY 22's two suffixed routes, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2022A">NY 22A</a>, begins its route running closely parallel to the state line and then into Vermont, where it becomes <a href="Vermont%20Route%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B22A">Vermont Route 22A</a> (VT 22A), paralleling the parent route for some distance on the other side of the state line.

Immediately after this junction, NY 22 begins a long curve away from the state line that has it running due west at the end of <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2040">NY 40</a> in North Granville. It heads northwest a little further until, after passing between <a href="Great%20Meadow%20Correctional%20Facility">Great Meadows</a> and <a href="Washington%20Correctional%20Facility">Washington</a> state prisons, it reaches <a href="U.S.%20Route%204%20in%20New%20York">US 4</a> and turns right to join it, resuming its northward course. At this point the highway is from the state line, the farthest west it has gotten from it since southern Westchester County. The overlap with US 4, the first to pair Route 22 with another north–south route since the short concurrency with NY 120, lasts for along the base of the Adirondack foothills between the low country and <a href="Lake%20George%20%28New%20York%29">Lake George</a>, before ending in <a href="Whitehall%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Whitehall</a>, where US 4 leaves to assume the east–west course it takes across northern New England.

As NY 22 bends westward after leaving Whitehall, it rounds the north end of the ridge to the west, offering views into Vermont. Once again the Vermont state line is very near NY 22, but now it is separated from New York by water instead of land. The stream at the bottom of this valley, surrounded by the low lying Drowned Lands <a href="flood%20plain">flood plain</a>, is the inflow for <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>. The lake's South Bay, which the road crosses immediately after this turn, is also the <a href="Blue%20Line%20%28New%20York%20State%29">Blue Line</a>. Route 22 has now entered the <a href="Adirondack%20Park">Adirondack Park</a>, the <a href="Forest%20Preserve%20%28New%20York%29">Forest Preserve</a> and <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>, and the largest publicly <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a> in the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a>. Within the park, NY 22 mainly follows the lakeshore, closer to some of its more populated areas.

It climbs through rock cuts as it meanders north on the narrowing <a href="isthmus">isthmus</a> between Lakes Champlain and George. Near the northern end, it crosses the <a href="Essex%20County%2C%20New%20York">Essex County</a> line. into the county, it reaches the first settlement along its length within the Adirondack Park, <a href="Ticonderoga%2C%20New%20York">Ticonderoga</a>. The highway skirts the northeastern edge of the village, the site of <a href="Battle%20of%20Ticonderoga%20%28disambiguation%29">key battles</a> in both the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian</a> and <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary</a> Wars, as <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2074">NY 74</a> comes in from the ferry to the east, the first intersecting state route since Whitehall, ending the longest such break on NY 22 at . The two routes overlap for almost until NY 74 goes straight ahead at the intersection with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%209N">NY 9N</a>, while NY 22 turns right to join NY 9N, the longest suffixed route in the state, and return to its northbound orientation for the longest of its concurrencies, at .

At first, Routes 22 and 9N veer west, away from the lake, but then return to its shoreline to avoid a nearby mountain, just before <a href="Crown%20Point%2C%20New%20York">Crown Point</a>. <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20185">NY 185</a>, a small connector road, runs from 9N and 22 along the peninsula to become <a href="Vermont%20Route%2017">VT 17</a>. The road remains close to the widening lake for the next , with the tracks of the <a href="Delaware%20and%20Hudson%20Railroad">Delaware and Hudson Railroad</a>, used today by <a href="CSX%20Transportation">CSX</a> for freight and <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> for <a href="Empire%20Service">passenger service</a> between New York and <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, sometimes immediately to the east. After passing through <a href="Port%20Henry%2C%20New%20York">Port Henry</a> to <a href="Westport%2C%20New%20York">Westport</a>, where 9N leaves heading west for <a href="Elizabethtown%2C%20New%20York">Elizabethtown</a>. Beyond that junction, Route 22 again turns inland, going through the easy pass around Split Rock Mountain, going northwest to <a href="Westport%2C%20New%20York%23Communities%20and%20locations%20in%20Westport">Wadhams</a> where it turns northeast to <a href="Essex%2C%20New%20York%23Communities%20and%20locations%20in%20Essex">Whallonsburg</a>, then north. At Boquet, it makes an abrupt turn to go due east back to the lakeshore and ferry landing at <a href="Essex%2C%20New%20York">Essex</a>, where it connects to the <a href="Charlotte%E2%80%93Essex%20Ferry">Charlotte–Essex Ferry</a> via Dock Street, leading to <a href="Vermont%20Route%20F-5">VT F-5</a> on the opposite side of Lake Champlain.

The highway again follows the lakeshore to <a href="Willsboro%2C%20New%20York">Willsboro</a>, where Route 22 heads to the northwest again, inland, through dense forest, until it heads west and intersects <a href="U.S.%20Route%209%20in%20New%20York">US 9</a> in the town of <a href="Chesterfield%2C%20New%20York">Chesterfield</a>, the other major north–south surface route up the state's eastern side. Routes 22 and 9 join together, closely parallel to the Adirondack Northway (<a href="Interstate%2087%20%28New%20York%29">I-87</a>), the only other route in the state to directly connect New York City with Canada. The three routes, spread over many miles in the southern part of the state, run through a narrow corridor for until Routes 9 and 22 veer east again toward <a href="Keeseville%2C%20New%20York">Keeseville</a>.

Here, Route 9N ends and Routes 9 and 22 separate, ending the last concurrency along the latter. The two will exchange corridors, with US 9 following the lake shore line while NY 22 remains mostly inland. NY 22 enters <a href="Clinton%20County%2C%20New%20York">Clinton County</a> just north of Keeseville, and then leaves Adirondack Park beyond at the <a href="Peru%2C%20New%20York">Peru</a> town line.

Just south of the <a href="Peru%20%28CDP%29%2C%20New%20York">hamlet of Peru</a>, the short <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20442">NY 442</a> terminates at Route 22. In the hamlet itself, after the Little Au Sable River crossing, NY 22's other suffixed route, NY 22B, branches off further inland. NY 22 continues north of Peru, and returns to the Northway's side again in a mile. After another , it has its first exit on the Northway near the now-closed <a href="Plattsburgh%20Air%20Force%20Base">Plattsburgh Air Force Base</a>. It continues northeastward, crossing the <a href="Saranac%20River">Saranac River</a> into <a href="Plattsburgh%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">Plattsburgh</a>, the first city and most populous community NY 22 has passed through since White Plains.
NY 22 runs along South Catherine Street for a few blocks, then divides into <a href="one-way%20couplet">one-way couplet</a>s for the first time since Westchester County, with northbound traffic moving a block to the east to follow Oak Street, while southbound traffic comes down North Catherine Street. It parallels US 9 for a couple of blocks, intersecting <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%203">NY 3</a> (Cornelia Street) just a block west of its eastern terminus at that highway. After Boynton Avenue, the separate streets reunite and turns northwest just before it has its second and final exit with the Northway. Just after the exit, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20374">NY 374</a> begins along the westbound route as NY 22 turns to the north once again.

The highway follows the railroad tracks into <a href="Beekmantown%2C%20New%20York">Beekmantown</a> until it bears left at a fork, trending further west to Beekmantown Corners, where another short local road, County Route 58, formerly <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20456">NY 456</a>, comes to its western end. After crossing into the next town, <a href="Chazy%2C%20New%20York">Chazy</a>, NY 22 bears left again at another fork to drift further to the west. The terrain around the road becomes increasingly wooded, with long unbroken stretches of pine, in the northern portion of the town. This is briefly broken at another western terminus of a short local road, County Route 23, formerly <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20191">NY 191</a>, in the hamlet of Sciota.

NY 22 continues past Sciota in a fairly straight north-northwesterly course through more woods with small home and farm clearings. Those yield to mostly fields just before the <a href="Great%20Chazy%20River">Great Chazy River</a>, after which NY 22 enters the <a href="Mooers%20%28CDP%29%2C%20New%20York">hamlet of Mooers</a>. NY 22 comes to an end upon intersecting <a href="U.S.%20Route%2011%20in%20New%20York">US 11</a>.

The road from the modern-day Bronx (then part of Westchester County) through White Plains to Bedford and points north was originally an old <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> path. This path was later used and widened by the first European settlers. During colonial times, the road was known as "the road to Bedford and Vermont". Further north, near Lake Champlain, the route now used by Route 22 was used by the <a href="St.%20Francis%20Indians">St. Francis Indians</a> of Canada as they went south to find warmer fishing areas. The old road was also used heavily during the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> to transport iron south from the mines in the <a href="Adirondacks">Adirondacks</a>.

Once <a href="White%20Plains%2C%20New%20York">White Plains</a> became the county seat of <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester</a> in 1759, the road between the village and the city of New York (then encompassing only <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>) became an important route and was established as the White Plains Post Road. Before 1797, the main road heading to points north and east out of Manhattan went via <a href="Kingsbridge%2C%20Bronx">Kingsbridge</a> along the old <a href="Boston%20Post%20Road">Boston Post Road</a>. A new bridge over the <a href="Harlem%20River">Harlem River</a> (the original <a href="Harlem%20Bridge">Harlem Bridge</a>) was opened in 1797, shortening the route out of Manhattan. This also relocated the Boston and White Plains Post roads to a new alignment along <a href="Third%20Avenue%20%28Bronx%29">Third Avenue</a> and <a href="Boston%20Road%20%28Bronx%29">Boston Road</a>. The White Plains Post Road separated from the Boston Post Road in Bronxdale, with the road to Boston heading east and the road to White Plains heading north. The old White Plains Post Road roughly followed the alignment of modern-day "White Plains Road", which was laid out in 1863. (The original post road was to the east of the modern-day avenue). The White Plains Post Road continued north through <a href="Olinville%2C%20New%20York">Olinville</a>, <a href="Wakefield%2C%20New%20York">Wakefield</a>, and <a href="Mount%20Vernon%2C%20New%20York">Mount Vernon</a>, where the route shifted east to modern-day White Plains Post Road, going through <a href="Bronxville%2C%20New%20York">Bronxville</a> and <a href="Scarsdale%2C%20New%20York">Scarsdale</a> to <a href="White%20Plains%2C%20New%20York">White Plains</a>.

The stretch from Salem to the <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> border in <a href="Granville%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Granville</a> was part of the old <a href="Northern%20Turnpike">Northern Turnpike</a>, which began in <a href="Lansingburgh%2C%20New%20York">Lansingburgh</a> and went along modern-day <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2040">NY 40</a>. The Northern Turnpike was chartered on April 1, 1799.

In 1868, the <a href="New%20York%20Legislature">New York State Legislature</a> formed a commission "to regulate, grade, widen, gravel, and improve the old White Plains Post Road", which was amended in 1870 to "macadamize the road" between Mount Vernon and White Plains. The post road south of Mount Vernon, which was part of New York City, was later widened between 1902 and 1908.

<a href="State%20highway">State highway</a>s were first formally defined by the state legislature in 1909 and given numeric designations, although these initial designations were not publicly signed. Portions of modern Route 22 were defined as part of legislative routes 1 and 22. Legislative route 1 went from the New York City line north along the White Plains Post Road to White Plains, then detoured to Harrison (via Westchester Avenue), before proceeding north to <a href="Armonk%2C%20New%20York">Armonk</a> (via modern <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20120">NY 120</a>). Legislative route 1 continued north along modern NY 22 to Austerlitz, where it then turned northwest to Valatie (via modern <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20203">NY 203</a> and NY 980B), then followed <a href="U.S.%20Route%209%20in%20New%20York">US 9</a> to Albany. Legislative route 22 had two segments. The southern segment began in Troy, following <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%207">NY 7</a> to Hoosick, then went north along modern NY 22 up to Putnam Station (south of Ticonderoga).

In 1924, New York signed several major state roads with route numbers. Most of Legislative Route 1 was designated as NY 22, but with a direct route between White Plains and <a href="Armonk%2C%20New%20York">Armonk</a>. Also, instead of continuing to Valatie, NY 22 initially ended at the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2023">NY 23</a> intersection in <a href="Hillsdale%2C%20New%20York">Hillsdale</a>. By 1929, the road to Valatie had been improved and NY 22 was extended to US 9, with a length of . The middle section of modern NY 22 was designated in 1924 as NY 24, running for from <a href="Stephentown%2C%20New%20York">Stephentown</a> to <a href="Comstock%2C%20New%20York">Comstock</a>. The portion of modern NY 22 north of Whitehall remained unnumbered in 1924 but the next year NY 30, a route assigned in 1924 that linked <a href="Mechanicville%2C%20New%20York">Mechanicville</a> to Whitehall, was extended north from Whitehall to the Canadian border north of <a href="Mooers%20%28CDP%29%2C%20New%20York">Mooers</a>. In the <a href="1930%20renumbering%20%28New%20York%29">1930 renumbering</a>, the NY 24 and NY 30 designations were both reassigned elsewhere. NY 22 was then extended north along their former routes, incorporating newly improved roads between <a href="Austerlitz%2C%20New%20York">Austerlitz</a> and <a href="Stephentown%2C%20New%20York">Stephentown</a>, creating the route that existed until 2008. The segment of old NY 22 between Austerlitz and Valatie was renumbered to <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20203">NY 203</a>.

In 1934, at the insistence of the Automobile Club of New York, several numbered routes were extended and signed within <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, with NY 22 among them. It was extended south from the Mount Vernon line in the Bronx along <a href="White%20Plains%20Road">White Plains Road</a>, then following <a href="East%20233rd%20Street%20%28Bronx%29">East 233rd Street</a> to <a href="Webster%20Avenue">Webster Avenue</a> until <a href="Fordham%20Road">Fordham Road</a> (<a href="U.S.%20Route%201%20in%20New%20York">US 1</a>). From there, it continued south along the <a href="Grand%20Concourse%20%28Bronx%29">Grand Concourse</a> (then overlapped with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20100">NY 100</a>), crossing into Manhattan via East 149th Street to the <a href="145th%20Street%20Bridge">145th Street Bridge</a>. In Manhattan, the NY 22/100 <a href="Concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrency</a> continued south along <a href="Lenox%20Avenue">Lenox Avenue</a>, <a href="110th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">110th Street</a>, <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a>, <a href="96th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">96th Street</a>, and <a href="Park%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Park Avenue</a>, ending at <a href="Houston%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Houston Street</a> (<a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%201A">NY 1A</a>). By 1941, the alignment within Mount Vernon was shifted east to use Columbus Avenue and South 3rd Avenue (current NY 22), continuing its route to New York City via East 233rd Street as before. On January 1, 1970, the NY 22 designation was removed from Manhattan and most of the Bronx, and the short piece remaining in the city was realigned to meet US 1 at Route 22's current southern terminus.

In the original plan for the <a href="U.S.%20Highway%20System">U.S. Highway System</a>, as approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in November 1926, <a href="U.S.%20Route%207">US 7</a> was defined as beginning in New York City and designated on the alignment of NY 22 to <a href="Amenia%2C%20New%20York">Amenia</a>, where it shifted northeast into <a href="Sharon%2C%20Connecticut">Sharon, Connecticut</a>, to use old <a href="New%20England%20Route%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B4">New England Route 4</a> through Massachusetts and Vermont all the way to the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canadian border</a>. Apparently New York did not approve this plan, and by mid-1927 the official route log published by the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20Officials">American Association of State Highway Officials</a> had relocated the southern end of US 7 to <a href="Norwalk%2C%20Connecticut">Norwalk, Connecticut</a>.

In the <a href="1930%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28New%20York%29">1930 renumbering of state highways in New York</a>, the stretch from <a href="Ticonderoga%2C%20New%20York">Ticonderoga</a> to <a href="Keeseville%2C%20New%20York">Keeseville</a> now concurrent with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%209N">NY 9N</a> was designated solely as Route 22. The north end of <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2047%20%281930%E2%80%931936%29">NY 47</a> was also located at an intersection with Route 22 in Ticonderoga. At Westport, NY 22 connected to <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20195%20%281930%E2%80%931936%29">NY 195</a>, an east–west highway leading to <a href="Elizabethtown%2C%20New%20York">Elizabethtown</a>. At the time, Route 9N only extended from there to Keeseville. NY 9N was extended southward to Lake George , supplanting Routes 47 and 195 and becoming concurrent with NY 22 between Ticonderoga and <a href="Westport%2C%20New%20York">Westport</a>.

NY 8 originally extended eastward from <a href="Hague%2C%20New%20York">Hague</a> to a ferry across <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a> at <a href="Putnam%2C%20New%20York">Putnam</a> when it was assigned as part of the renumbering. In between the two locations, the route utilized modern NY 9N, Montcalm Street, NY 22, and Wrights Ferry and Wrights roads. It was realigned in the early 1930s to continue east from Ticonderoga on what is now <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2074">NY 74</a> to another ferry across the lake. NY 8 was altered again to follow NY 22 north from Ticonderoga to Crown Point, where it turned off the highway onto Bridge Road (now <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20185">NY 185</a>). Route 8 remained intact along this routing until , when Route 8 was truncated southwestward to NY 9N at <a href="Hague%2C%20New%20York">Hague</a>.

Over the course of many years, several sections of NY 22 were straightened, realigned to new roads, or both. Some old alignments are still either county-maintained or state-maintained. Several of these are in <a href="Dutchess%20County%2C%20New%20York">Dutchess County</a>. In <a href="Dover%20Plains%2C%20New%20York">Dover Plains</a>, the southern leg of NY 22's junction with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20343">NY 343</a> is maintained by the state as NY 980G, a <a href="reference%20route%20%28New%20York%29">reference route</a>. To the north in the <a href="Amenia%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">town of Amenia</a>, a loop off NY 22 between <a href="Wassaic%2C%20New%20York">Wassaic</a> and <a href="Amenia%20%28CDP%29%2C%20New%20York">Amenia</a> is designated as CR 81. Another former routing of NY 22 in the town of <a href="Dover%2C%20New%20York">Dover</a> exists as CR 6, a loop route between the hamlets of Wingdale and Dover Plains that runs along the west bank of the <a href="Ten%20Mile%20River%20%28Connecticut%29">Ten Mile River</a>. Within the 44/22 concurrency, part of <a href="County%20Route%205%20%28Dutchess%20County%2C%20New%20York%29">CR 5</a> (and its short spur 5S), a mile-long (1.6 km) loop west of the highway south of <a href="Millerton%2C%20New%20York">Millerton</a>, is also a former alignment of Route 22.

Before the construction of <a href="Interstate%20684">I-684</a>, NY 22 continued northeast along Sodom Road north of <a href="Brewster%2C%20New%20York">Brewster</a> on what is now CR 50, a dead-end road maintained by <a href="Putnam%20County%2C%20NY">Putnam County</a>. Modern NY 22 joins the I-684 roadway at exit 10 (the northern terminus of I-684) and connects to the surface road on the opposite side of the <a href="Croton%20River">Croton River</a> via the NY 981B connector. South of <a href="Copake%20Falls%2C%20New%20York">Copake Falls</a>, the state also still maintains an old alignment designated as NY 980F. North of Copake Falls, the northern half of the original alignment was designated as an extension of <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20344">NY 344</a>.

The segment of NY 22 north of US 11, named Hemmingford Road, was state-maintained until 1988, when ownership and maintenance of that part of the route was transferred to <a href="Clinton%20County%2C%20New%20York">Clinton County</a> as part of a highway maintenance swap between the county and the state of New York. Following the swap, it was <a href="overlap%20%28road%29">co-designated</a> as CR 34 by Clinton County. In 2008, the signed northern terminus of NY 22 was moved to the east end of its overlap with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2011%20in%20New%20York">US 11</a> in Mooers. The official alignment of NY 22 was not changed, however, as the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Department%20of%20Transportation">New York State Department of Transportation</a> still considered the Canadian border to be NY 22's northern terminus until 2014.

The road is celebrated and described in <a href="Benjamin%20Swett">Benjamin Swett</a>'s 2007 photographic travelogue, "Route 22".

NY 22 has two suffixed routes, both in the <a href="North%20Country%2C%20New%20York">North Country</a>.

History of the British farthing

The British farthing (derived from the <a href="Old%20English">Anglo-Saxon</a> "feorthing", a "fourthling" or "fourth part") was a British coin worth a quarter of an <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">old penny</a> ( of a <a href="pound%20sterling">pound sterling</a>). It ceased to be struck after 1956 and was demonetised from 1 January 1961.

The British farthing is a continuation of the <a href="Farthing%20%28English%20coin%29">English farthing</a>, struck by English monarchs prior to the <a href="Act%20of%20Union%201707">Act of Union 1707</a>, which unified the crowns of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain. Only <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern</a> farthings were struck under <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> as there was a glut of farthings from previous reigns. The coin was struck intermittently under <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a> and <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">George II</a>, but by the reign of <a href="George%20III">George III</a>, counterfeits were so prevalent the <a href="Royal%20Mint">Royal Mint</a> ceased striking copper coinage after 1775. The next farthings were the first struck by steam power, in 1799 by <a href="Matthew%20Boulton">Matthew Boulton</a> at his <a href="Soho%20Mint">Soho Mint</a> under licence. Boulton coined more in 1806, and the Royal Mint resumed production in 1821. The farthing was struck fairly regularly under <a href="George%20IV">George IV</a> and <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">William IV</a>. By then it carried a scaled-down version of the penny's design, and would continue to mirror the penny and <a href="halfpenny%20%28British%20coin%29">halfpenny</a> until after 1936.

Farthings were struck in most years of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s long reign. The coin continued to be issued in most years of the first half of the 20th century, and in 1937 it finally received its own reverse design, a <a href="wren">wren</a>. By the time the coin bore the portrait of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> in 1953–1956, inflation had eroded its value. A fall in commercial demand also contributed to its demise.

The British farthing is a continuation of the farthing series begun in silver under the English king <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> in the 13th century and first struck in copper in the early 17th century under <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I of England</a>. <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a> first appeared on the coin in 1672, under <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>. Issuance of farthings had not been necessary during most of the reign of <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> (1701–1714) due to a surplus of English farthings, which continued in circulation. But beginning in 1713, there was a shortage of copper coin (the <a href="halfpenny%20%28British%20coin%29">halfpenny</a> and farthing). The Royal Mint planned to issue farthings in 1714, but this was thwarted by the death of the Queen that year. The 1714 farthing, weighing 4.8–5.8 grams and of 21–22 millimetres diameter, is deemed a <a href="Pattern%20coin">pattern</a>. It contained about a farthing's worth of copper, as Sir <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> was Master of the Mint, and he believed coins should contain their value in metal. Some Anne farthings escaped into circulation, and there was a persistent and incorrect legend that they were of immensely high value. Britannia is said to bear the likeness of Queen Anne, and according to the numismatic writer Kerry Rodgers, "it was at this point that the blending of the female personification of Britain with the image of the reigning Queen takes firm hold." Newton had strong views about the quality of the coinage, and the Anne farthing displays advances, such as greater consistency in striking, over that of <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a>.

The need for a copper coinage was no less after the accession of King <a href="George%20I%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George I</a> (1714–1727), but the Anne halfpennies and farthings (made with metal prepared at the Royal Mint) had failed tests for purity, and it was not until 1717 that Newton tried to coin those two denominations again, this time from copper strip purchased from a contractor. The price of metal had risen, so the new farthings were lighter than the Anne coins, at 4.5–5.3 grams. The farthings struck in 1717 were smaller and thicker than the 1714 coins, with a diameter of 20–21 millimetres, and they are known as "dump" farthings. Farthings of 1719–1724 are slightly larger, at 22–23 millimetres, but are of the same weight. The coins were in high relief, and the Royal Mint had trouble transferring the design to the blanks, resulting in myriad flaws. The coin features the right-facing head of King George and the inscription on the obverse, and for the reverse a design identical to that of the Anne farthings: Britannia with the inscription and the date in the <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23E">exergue</a> below. Farthings were for sale at the Mint's premises at the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> in packets of five and ten shillings; the Treasury refused to allocate funds for provincial distribution. The farthing's designs were by <a href="John%20Croker%20%28engraver%29">John Croker</a>, possibly assisted by Johann Rudolph Ochs Sr, and were struck in every year from 1717–1724. The Mint had contracted for strip for seven years; when the contract ended, the coinage stopped.
George I died in 1727, the same year as Newton, and the king's son <a href="George%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George II</a> succeeded to the throne, reigning until 1760. Croker engraved the new King's head for the coinage; the Britannia design was not changed. Farthings with Croker's design for George's head were minted in 1730–1737 and 1739. A bust showing an older King by <a href="John%20Sigismund%20Tanner">John Sigismund Tanner</a> was used on the farthing in 1741, 1744, 1746, 1749, 1750, and 1754, though the 1754 coin was probably minted at least until 1763. All George II farthings weighed 4.5–5.3 grams and had a diameter of 22–23 millimetres. Both obverses showed left-facing heads of King George and the inscription , and on the reverse, Britannia with the inscription and the date in the exergue. The farthing was made in relatively small number compared to the halfpenny (struck every year from 1730–1754); in no year were even half as many farthings coined, and in most years, far fewer.

The 1754 stoppage was due to a glut of coppers, and was done at the urgent request of merchants. Even then, a different problem—counterfeiting—had emerged. Lightweight counterfeit halfpennies and farthings (the penny was then made of silver) had been seen as early as 1725, and in the following decades, they became a flood. The laws at the time made counterfeiting copper coin merely a <a href="misdemeanour">misdemeanour</a>, punishable by a fine or a short term in gaol, while counterfeiting of gold and silver was dealt with severely. The counterfeits were especially prevalent in rural areas where regal issues, with no organised plan of distribution, were rarely seen. No farthings were coined after 1754, with the exception of 1754-dated later issues which may have been due to the Royal Mint using up stocks of copper. To make the counterfeiting uneconomical, in 1755 the Mint Board proposed reducing the value of the farthing to pence and the halfpenny to , but the Government refused.

The first halfpennies and farthings with the head of George II's grandson and successor, <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> (1760–1820), were issued in 1771, the year Parliament made it a felony to counterfeit copper coin. This had little effect; large quantities were melted down for lightweight imitations, though the farthing was less counterfeited than the halfpenny. This first series of George III farthings, struck in 1771 and 1773–1775, had a weight of 4.3–5.3 grams, with diameter 23–24 millimetres. The obverse, designed by <a href="Richard%20Yeo">Richard Yeo</a> or <a href="Thomas%20Pingo">Thomas Pingo</a> depicts a right-facing bust of the king, with the inscription , while no significant change was made to the reverse. Despite the counterfeiting, the Mint ceased striking coppers in 1775 on the ground that there were sufficient legal farthings and halfpennies in commerce. The farthing would not be struck again by the Royal Mint until 1821.

From 1775, most copper coins in circulation were counterfeit. The private sector eventually reacted, filling the gap with <a href="Conder%20token">private tokens</a> starting in 1787, and the Treasury awarded a contract to <a href="Matthew%20Boulton">Matthew Boulton</a> to strike copper coins in 1797. At his <a href="Soho%20Mint">Soho Mint</a> near Birmingham, Boulton produced the well-known Cartwheel pennies and twopences, so named for their appearance, the first official British coins struck by steam. The contract did not include producing farthings, though Boulton prepared several patterns. In 1799, Boulton was given a licence to produce halfpennies and farthings. In the meantime the price of copper had risen, and a more conventional coin was struck.

The 1799 farthing broke new ground in two areas: the reverse was inscribed , the first time the name of a denomination had ever appeared on an English or British coin, and it was also the first British coin to have the date on the same side as the monarch's head. The inscription on the obverse became , and the reverse depicts a redesigned left-facing seated Britannia holding a spray and spear, with the inscription . In 1806–1807 a further 22.5 tons of copper was struck into farthings by Boulton, but the price of copper had risen again and the weight was less than the 1799 issue. Farthings of the 1799 issue weigh 5.8–6.6 grams, with a diameter 23–24 millimetres, while the later Boulton issue weighs 4.7–4.8 grams with a diameter 21–22 millimetres. For the 1806–1807 issues, the denomination was removed from the coin, was abbreviated as , and the image of Britannia was slightly modified. Copper farthings and halfpennies from before 1797 were called in by proclamation dated 5 December 1817, and were redeemed by weight.
The currency was reformed in the 1810s with the <a href="Great%20Recoinage%20of%201816">Great Recoinage of 1816</a>. The production of copper coins did not resume until after George III's death in 1820 and the accession of <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George IV</a> (1820–1830). Farthings were produced in 1821, Britannia maintaining her place on the reverse. These pieces were made current by a proclamation of 14 November of that year, that made them <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> to sixpence. The original coinage portrait of the King, by <a href="Benedetto%20Pistrucci">Benedetto Pistrucci</a>, attracted strong royal dislike, but was used on the farthing in 1821 and in 1823–26. By then, Pistrucci had been barred from work on the coinage for refusing to copy the work of another artist. <a href="William%20Wyon">William Wyon</a> was given the task of engraving what became the more flattering "bare head" type of 1826. The issue of coppers in 1826 was because of the withdrawal of separate issues for Ireland; the Irish penny had been valued at of its British equivalent. The reverse was redesigned slightly, but remained more or less the same. The Pistrucci-designed farthings weighed 4.5–4.8 grams, with a diameter of 22 millimetres; the later ones by Wyon (issued each year from 1826–1830) weighed 4.6–4.9 grams with a diameter of 22 millimetres. Both Pistrucci's and Wyon's designs were produced in 1826. The Pistrucci obverse shows a left-facing bust of King George IV with the inscription , while the reverse shows a right-facing helmeted Britannia seated to the left of the coin, holding a shield and trident, with the inscription and the date in the exergue under Britannia. The Wyon obverse shows a laureate bust of King George IV, facing left, with the inscription , while the reverse inscription is unchanged.

The death of King George in 1830 brought his brother, <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King William IV</a> (1830–1837) to the throne. Wyon, by then Chief Engraver, left the reverse of the farthing unchanged, and for the obverse engraved a portrait of King William by Sir <a href="Francis%20Chantrey">Francis Chantrey</a>. The inscriptions were unchanged, except that (William IV) was substituted for on the obverse. The farthing was produced in 1831, and 1834–1837, the final issue being struck during the year of King William's death.

Farthings bearing the portrait of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, by Wyon, were struck beginning in 1838; no change was made to the reverse other than substituting the abbreviation (Regina, or Queen) for (King), indicating there was now a reigning Queen. The farthing remained the same size it had been since 1826. From 1838, the farthing was struck every year of Victoria's long reign except 1870, 1871 and 1889 (the 1877 issue was only in <a href="proof%20coin">proof</a> and may have been made at a later date). The same obverse dies were used for the copper farthing and the <a href="sovereign%20%28British%20coin%29">sovereign</a> and most likely were used for the gold coin first. This contributed to a high level of defects in the farthing series, but ensured that they were struck every year, as was the popular gold coin. In Victorian times, a farthing could buy three oysters, with bread and butter, from an oyster-seller walking the streets of London. The coin would be enough to purchase a sparrow at a market in <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">London's East End</a>.

In 1859, the Government decided the poor state of the copper coinage demanded its withdrawal. Bronze was deemed a suitable replacement. Parliament passed legislation in 1860 that allowed the penny, halfpenny and farthing to be struck from an alloy of metals. Large quantity of bronze pennies, halfpennies and farthings were struck beginning in 1860 not only by the Royal Mint but by two Birmingham firms under contract. Although the weight of the penny was halved, the farthing was lightened by a bit less than that lest it be too small. The farthing was virtually identical to the penny and halfpenny but for minor details. The new bronze coinage went into circulation in December 1860; the old copper pieces were demonetised after 31 December 1869 in Britain (though the Mint would still accept them until 1873) and at the end of 1877 for the colonies.
The new bronze farthings weighed 2.8–3.0 grams, were 20 millimetres in diameter, and were made of an alloy of 95% copper, 4% tin and 1% zinc. Disregarding minor changes in alloy, these would remain the farthing's specifications until abolition after 1956. They read on the reverse, with the date in the exergue beneath Britannia. The obverse features the "Bun head" or "Young head" of Victoria; both sides of the coin were designed by <a href="Leonard%20Charles%20Wyon">Leonard Charles Wyon</a>, William's son. The inscription on the obverse was . An "H" mintmark underneath the date can be seen on some 1874–1876 and 1881–1882 farthings; they were struck at the <a href="Birmingham%20Mint">Heaton Mint</a> in Birmingham. Although the Bun farthing series produced several <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics">varieties</a>, they are not as extensive as for the penny and halfpenny. The farthing tended to have the lowest mintages of the three bronze coins, between 1 and 6 million being struck in most years in the late <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>; more halfpennies were struck than farthings, and mintages of the penny were regularly exceeding 10 million by the 1890s. Although fewer farthings were struck, a larger percentage has survived due to the sentimental attachment of the British people to the coin lowest in denomination.

In 1896, a new obverse was introduced to the bronze coinage showing Victoria as an elderly woman. The obverse was designed by <a href="Thomas%20Brock">Thomas Brock</a> and engraved by <a href="George%20William%20de%20Saulles">George William de Saulles</a>. The farthing continued to display it until the year of the Queen's death, 1901. De Saulles also revised the reverse; the most significant change was the deletion of the lighthouse and ship on either side of Britannia; they would never return to the farthing. The inscription on the Old Head farthing was . Beginning in 1897, farthings were issued artificially darkened; this was to avoid confusion of bright new farthings with the <a href="half%20sovereign">half sovereign</a>; the bronze farthing and the gold piece were the same size.

The farthing of King <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a> (1901–1910), Victoria's son and successor, was struck in every year from 1902–1910; it was still artificially darkened. Mintages ranged from 2.6 million (1910) to 8.9 million (1908) at a time when the penny's mintage never dropped below 12 million and rose to 47 million in 1907. A total of £1,021,013 in pennies were struck bearing Edward's portrait, and £222,790 in halfpennies, but only £45,429 in farthings. But for the statement of the coin's value, the designs on the penny, halfpenny and farthing are effectively identical as De Saulles used a Janvier <a href="reducing%20lathe">reducing lathe</a> to convert models to dies. The new obverse was his work, showing the king's right-facing bust, with the inscription .

The farthings of Edward's son and successor, King <a href="George%20V">George V</a>, resulted in a new left-facing portrait by Sir <a href="Bertram%20Mackennal">Bertram Mackennal</a> and the continuation of the Britannia design. Farthings bearing King George's portrait were produced every year of his reign but 1910 and 1936. Other than substituting (George V) for , no change was made to the inscription. In 1917, the Mint ceased to darken farthings as the half sovereign was no longer being minted. In common with the penny and halfpenny, the King's head was made slightly smaller in 1926. The depiction of Britannia was also slightly adjusted in that year. A total of £5,710,748 in pennies, £1,039,704 in halfpennies and £222,643 in farthings were struck for the reign.

The <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a> farthing is a pattern which was awaiting royal approval at the time of the abdication in December 1936. There was a movement afoot for more modern coinage designs; the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> had in 1927 adopted a series of coins depicting animals and some of the colonies had redesigned their coinages. King Edward was also interested in a move away from the heraldry that marked British coinage, showing foreign coins on his watch chain to the Deputy Master of the Mint, <a href="Robert%20Johnson%20%28civil%20servant%29">Robert Johnson</a>, and asking for more like those. King Edward eventually gave in on the question, fearing that such designs would be unacceptable to the British people, but non-heraldic themes for the halfpenny (a sailing ship) and farthing survived. The selected design for the farthing, a <a href="wren">wren</a>, placed the smallest British bird on the British coin smallest in value. In an attempt to break the deadlock between King and Mint, artist Wilson Parker had prepared a series of coinage designs based on what were loosely deemed royal animals: eagle, dove, stag, sturgeon, swan and wren, which though liked by the Advisory Committee (including a young <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a>) did not receive their endorsement due to their preference for heraldry. Another reason for the change was that the Britannia design, reduced from a model, was difficult to appreciate given the coin's small size. The obverse was designed by <a href="Humphrey%20Paget">Humphrey Paget</a>. King Edward got his way on one matter; his portrait faced left on the patterns, whereas by tradition a monarch faces in the opposite direction from the last reign, and George V had faced left. Edward insisted as he considered his left profile his better side. The only change to the inscription was the substitution of (Edward VIII) for .
The wren design was approved for the coinage of Edward's brother and successor, King <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> (1936–1952); it would stay on the coin for its remaining twenty years. Paget redesigned his obverse to include the new king's left-facing bust, and the wording was adjusted to include . The coin was struck each year from 1937. In 1949, following the independence of India, was removed from the obverse. The accession of Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> in 1952 brought a new portrait to the farthing the following year, designed by <a href="Mary%20Gillick">Mary Gillick</a>. The obverse inscription was in 1953, and thereafter. This change was a recognition that some of the nations of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth">British Commonwealth</a> were republics.

In the years after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the farthing had seen more use, as the standard one-pound (454 g) bread loaf had its price set by government, and the price included an odd halfpenny; thus a cash transaction for the purchase of a half-pound loaf by itself required a farthing, either with the payment or change. By the 1950s, due to inflation, the purchasing power of the farthing had dropped, as had commercial demand. Letters to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" reflected this reality: one correspondent reported being refused when offering eight farthings to a bus conductor for a twopenny fare, and a vendor becoming abusive when offered six farthings for a newspaper. This occurred even though, as a later letter noted, the coin was still legal tender to a shilling. Demand continued to dwindle, and production of the farthing was discontinued after 1956. Eliminating the farthing from commerce also made way for a possible smaller penny and halfpenny that Royal Mint officials contemplated proposing.. The farthing ceased to be legal tender after 31 December 1960.

Kronan (ship)

Kronan, also called Stora Kronan, was a Swedish <a href="warship">warship</a> that served as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the <a href="Swedish%20Navy">Swedish Navy</a> in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> in the 1670s. When built, she was one of the largest seagoing vessels in the world. The construction of "Kronan" lasted from 1668 to 1672 and was delayed by difficulties with financing and conflicts between the shipwright <a href="Francis%20Sheldon">Francis Sheldon</a> and the Swedish admiralty. After four years of service, the ship foundered in rough weather at the <a href="Battle%20of%20%C3%96land">Battle of Öland</a> on 1 June 1676: while making a sharp turn under too much sail she <a href="Capsizing">capsize</a>d, and the <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29%23Naval%20magazines">magazine</a> ignited and blew off most of the <a href="bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a>. "Kronan" sank quickly, taking about 800 men and more than 100 guns with her, along with valuable military equipment, weapons, personal items, and large quantities of silver and gold coins.

The loss of "Kronan" was a hard blow for Sweden during the <a href="Scanian%20War">Scanian War</a>. Besides being the largest and most heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an important status symbol for the monarchy of the young <a href="Charles%20XI%20of%20Sweden">Charles XI</a>. Along with "Kronan", the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander <a href="Lorentz%20Creutz">Lorentz Creutz</a>, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could be held responsible for the Swedish fiasco at the <a href="Battle%20of%20%C3%96land">Battle of Öland</a> and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially held accountable, Creutz has been blamed by many historians for the sinking of "Kronan" because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research has provided a more nuanced picture, and points to Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.

Most of the guns that sank with "Kronan" were salvaged in the 1680s, but eventually the wreck fell into obscurity. Its exact position was rediscovered in 1980 by the amateur researcher <a href="Anders%20Franz%C3%A9n">Anders Franzén</a>, who had also located the 17th-century warship "<a href="Vasa%20%28ship%29">Vasa</a>" in the 1950s. Yearly diving operations have since surveyed and excavated the wreck site and salvaged artifacts, and "Kronan" has become the most widely publicized shipwreck in the Baltic after "Vasa". More than 30,000 artifacts have been recovered, and many have been conserved and put on permanent public display at the Kalmar County Museum in <a href="Kalmar">Kalmar</a>. The museum is responsible for the <a href="maritime%20archaeology">maritime archaeological</a> operations and the permanent exhibitions on "Kronan".

In the 1660s, Sweden was at its height as a European <a href="great%20power">great power</a>. It had defeated Denmark, one of its main competitors for hegemony in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a>, in both the <a href="Torstenson%20War">Torstenson War</a> (1643–45) and the <a href="Dano-Swedish%20War%20%281657%E2%80%9358%29">Dano-Swedish War (1657–58)</a>. At the <a href="Second%20Treaty%20of%20Br%C3%B6msebro%20%281645%29">Treaties of Brömsebro</a> (1645) and <a href="Treaty%20of%20Roskilde">Roskilde</a> (1658), Denmark had been forced to cede the islands of <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a> and <a href="%C3%96sel">Ösel</a>, all of its eastern territories on the <a href="Scandinavian%20Peninsula">Scandinavian Peninsula</a>, and parts of Norway. In a <a href="Dano-Swedish%20War%20%281658%E2%80%931660%29">third war</a>, from 1658 to 1660, King <a href="Charles%20X%20Gustav%20of%20Sweden">Charles X</a> of Sweden attempted to finish off Denmark for good. The move was bold royal ambition in an already highly militarized society geared for warfare, a <a href="fiscal-military%20state">fiscal-military state</a>. Disbanding its armies would have required paying outstanding wages, so there was an underlying incentive to keep hostilities alive and let soldiers live off enemy lands and plunder. The renewed attack on Denmark threatened the interests of the leading shipping nations of England and the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a>, who were best served by keeping the Baltic region politically divided. The Dutch intervened in 1658 by sending a fleet to stop the attempt to crush Denmark. England also sent a fleet in November the same year, to assist Sweden in keeping the <a href="Sound%20Toll">Sound Toll</a> out of Danish and Dutch control. The English expedition failed as a result of adverse winter weather and the political turmoil that ended <a href="the%20Protectorate">the Protectorate</a>, and in the end, Charles' plans were thwarted.

Charles X died in February 1660. Three months later, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Copenhagen%20%281660%29">Treaty of Copenhagen</a> ended the war. Charles' son and successor, <a href="Charles%20XI">Charles XI</a>, was only five when his father died, so a <a href="regency%20council">regency council</a>—led by the <a href="queen%20mother">queen mother</a> <a href="Hedvig%20Eleonora%20of%20Holstein-Gottorp">Hedvig Eleonora</a>—assumed power until he came of age. Sweden had come close to control over trade in the Baltic, but the war revealed the need to prevent the formation of a powerful anti-Swedish alliance that included Denmark. There were some successes in foreign policy, notably the anti-French <a href="Triple%20Alliance%20%281668%29">Triple Alliance</a> of England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic. By early 1672, Sweden had improved its relations with France enough to form an alliance. The same year, King <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a> attacked the Dutch Republic, and in 1674 Sweden was pressured into joining the war by attacking the Republic's northern German allies. France promised to pay Sweden desperately needed war subsidies on condition that it moved in force on <a href="Brandenburg-Prussia">Brandenburg</a>. A Swedish army of 22,000 men under <a href="Carl%20Gustaf%20Wrangel">Carl Gustaf Wrangel</a> advanced into Brandenburg in December 1674 and suffered a minor tactical defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fehrbellin">Battle of Fehrbellin</a> in June 1675. Though not militarily significant, the defeat tarnished the reputation of near-invincibility that Swedish arms had enjoyed since the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>. This emboldened Sweden's enemies, and by September 1675 Denmark, the Dutch Republic and the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> were at war with Sweden and France.

By 1675 the Swedish fleet was numerically superior to its Danish counterpart (18 ships of the line against 16, 21 frigates against 11), but the Swedish ships were generally older and of poorer quality than the Danish, which had replaced a larger proportion of its vessels with more modern warships. The Swedish side also had problems with routine maintenance, and both rigging and sails were generally in poor condition. Swedish crews lacked the level of professionalism of Danish and Norwegian sailors, who often had experience from service in the Dutch merchant navy, and the Swedish Navy lacked a core of professional officers while the Danish had seasoned veterans like <a href="Cort%20Adeler">Cort Adeler</a> and <a href="Nils%20Juel">Nils Juel</a>. The Danish fleet was reinforced with Dutch units under <a href="Philip%20van%20Almonde">Philip van Almonde</a> and <a href="Cornelis%20Tromp">Cornelis Tromp</a>, the latter an experienced officer who had served under <a href="Michiel%20de%20Ruyter">Michiel de Ruyter</a>.

The <a href="First%20Anglo-Dutch%20War">First Anglo-Dutch War</a> (1652–54) saw the development of the <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a>, a tactic where ships formed a continuous line to fire <a href="broadside">broadside</a>s at an enemy. Previously, <a href="naval%20tactics">naval tactics</a> had favored short-range firepower and boarding with intent to take <a href="prize%20%28law%29">prizes</a>. After the mid-17th century, tactics shifted from close-quarter fighting to disabling or sinking opponents through superior, long-distance firepower. This entailed major changes in doctrine, shipbuilding, and professionalism in European navies from the 1650s onwards. The line of battle favored large ships that were heavily armed and robust enough to hold the line in the face of enemy fire. The increased centralization and concentration of power in the emerging nation-states during the late 17th century allowed for a great expansion of armies and navies, and new government shipyards began building much much larger ships. Sweden embarked on an expansive shipbuilding program in the late 1660s.

"Kronan" was one of the most heavily armed warships in the world in 1672 when she was launched, a <a href="three-decker">three-decker</a> with 110 guns. The ship had three full <a href="gundeck">gundeck</a>s with guns from bow to stern. Altogether there were seven separate levels, divided by six decks. Furthest down in the ship, above the keel, was the <a href="hold%20%28ship%29">hold</a>, and immediately above it, but still below the waterline, lay the <a href="orlop">orlop</a>; both were used primarily for storage. Above the orlop were the three gundecks, two of them covered, while about half of the topmost gundeck was open to the elements in the ship's middle, or waist. The bow had one deck, making up the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a>, and the stern had two decks, including a <a href="poop%20deck">poop deck</a>.

During the first half of the 17th century, Swedish warships were built in the Dutch manner, with a flat, rectangular bottom with a small <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a>. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in the shallow coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When "Kronan" was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded bottom and greater draft, as well as a sturdier frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened <a href="Wave-making%20resistance">resistance</a>.

The measurements for "Kronan" were recorded in contemporary navy lists. Its length from stem post to stern post was 53 m (174 ft); this was considerably shorter than the length if the <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a> and <a href="beakhead">beakhead</a> were included. The width was 12.9 m (42 ft) and was defined as the widest point between the <a href="frame%20%28nautical%29">frames</a>, excluding planking. The draft varied depending on how heavily she was laden, but with full stores, ammunition and armaments it would have been about 6.2–6.8 m (20–22 ft). The height of the ship from keel to the highest mast was never recorded, but Kalmar County Museum has estimated it to have been at least 66 m (217 ft).

"Kronan"s <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displacement</a> – the ship's weight calculated by how much water it displaced while floating – is not known precisely, since there are no exact records of the dimensions. By using contemporary documents describing the approximate measurements, it has been estimated at around 2,300 tonnes. By its displacement in relation to the number and weight of guns, "Kronan" was over-gunned, though this was not uncommon for the era. European shipwrights had not been building three-deckers on a large scale before the 1650s; by the 1660s, designs were still quite experimental. Contemporary records show that English and French three-deckers tended to be rather unstable because they were built high, narrow and with too much artillery. Some English ships had to be reinforced with a "girdle" of built-up planking at the waterline to perform satisfactorily. In rough seas these ships could be forced to close the lowest row of gunports, depriving them of their heaviest and most effective guns. In these situations they were effectively just over-priced <a href="two-decker">two-decker</a>s. "Kronan"s construction was not inherently flawed; the ship handled harsh weather conditions in 1675 and again only a week before capsizing, but she could be dangerous if handled poorly. Later, during the 18th century, ships with the same weight of guns had more tonnage to support their guns, usually weighing 3,000–5,000 tonnes, which made them more stable. When "Kronan" was built, she was the third or fourth largest ship in the world, but as the trend moved towards ever greater ships, she was surpassed by other large warships. At the time "Kronan" sank, she was down to seventh place.

According to the official armament plan "Kronan" was to be equipped with 124–126 guns; 34–36 guns on each of the gundecks and an additional 18 shared between forecastle and <a href="sterncastle">sterncastle</a> decks. Guns were classed by the weight of the <a href="Round%20shot">cannonballs</a> they fired, varying between 3 and 36 pounds (1.3–15.3 kg). The guns themselves weighed from a few hundred kg (400–500 lbs) up to four tonnes (4.4 <a href="short%20ton">tons</a>) with the heaviest pieces placed in the middle of the lower-most gundeck with successively lighter ones on the decks above. "Kronan"s most lethal weapons were the 30- and 36-pounders on the lowest gundeck which had a range and firepower that outclassed the armament of almost any other warship. The guns lighter than 18-pounders were primarily intended to inflict damage on the enemy's crew and rigging rather than the hull.

According to modern research, the number of guns was considerably less than the official armament plan. At the time, armament plans regularly overstated the number of guns available. In reality, they were ideal estimations that seldom reflected actual conditions, either because of a lack of ordnance or because they were impractical when tested. Heavy 30- and 36-pounder guns were particularly difficult to find in sufficient numbers and lighter guns were frequently used instead. Going by the number of guns salvaged from "Kronan" in the 1680s (see "<a href="%23History%20as%20a%20shipwreck">History as a shipwreck</a>") and during the excavations in the 1980s the total comes to 105–110. The upper figure matches the calculations of the number of gunports on the remains of the wreck and the number of guns that could practically fit on the gun decks. The lower figure is the number of guns found in the 1980s excavations combined with the list of guns brought up during the salvage operations in the 1680s. The table below lists the number of guns, comparing the official 1671 armament plan to the calculations by naval historian <a href="Jan%20Glete">Jan Glete</a>.

Several types of ammunition were available, each for different uses: round shot (cannonballs) against ship hulls, <a href="chain%20shot">chain shot</a> against masts and rigging, and <a href="Grapeshot">canister shot</a> (wooden cylinders filled with metal balls or fragments), which had a devastating effect on tightly packed groups of men. For boarding actions "Kronan" was equipped with 130 <a href="musket">musket</a>s and 80 <a href="matchlock">matchlock</a> or <a href="flintlock">flintlock</a> pistols. For close combat there were 250 <a href="Pike%20%28weapon%29">pike</a>s, 200 boarding axes and 180 swords. During the excavations, large-caliber firearms were found – "hakebössor", similar to <a href="blunderbuss">blunderbuss</a>es; they were equipped with a small catch underneath the barrel which allowed them to be hooked over a railing to allow it to absorb the recoil of the charges. One "hakebössa" was still loaded with a small canister containing 20 lead balls that would have been used to clear enemy decks before boarding.

Expensive and elaborate ornamentation was an important part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, even though it had been simplified since the early 17th century. Such ornamentation was believed to enhance the authority of <a href="absolute%20monarch">absolute monarch</a>s and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the ornamentation of "Kronan", but according to common practice it was most lavish on the <a href="transom%20%28nautical%29">transom</a>, the flat surface facing aft. There are two images of "Kronan" shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. <a href="Claus%20M%C3%B8inichen">Claus Møinichen</a>'s painting at <a href="Fredriksborg%20Palace">Fredriksborg Palace</a> from 1686 shows a transom dominated by two lions <a href="rampant">rampant</a> holding up a huge royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of "<a href="Vasa%20%28ship%29">Vasa</a>", a prestige ship of <a href="Gustavus%20Adolphus">Gustavus Adolphus</a>'s navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that Møinichen may have intentionally exaggerated the size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. A <a href="tapestry">tapestry</a> at <a href="Rosenborg%20Castle">Rosenborg Castle</a> shows "Kronan" as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than Møinichen's painting.

Archaeologists have not been able to recover enough of "Kronan"s sculptures for a detailed reconstruction of the ornamentation. The <a href="mascaron%20%28architecture%29">mascarons</a> (architectural facemasks) and <a href="putto">putti</a> (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and is an example of high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is known of the surrounding ornamentation and sculptures, the conclusion remains speculative.

In the early 1660s, a building program was initiated to expand the fleet and replace old capital ships. A new flagship was needed to replace the old "Kronan" from 1632. The felling of vast quantities of timber that were required for the new admiral's ship had already begun in the winter of 1664–65. Swedish historian Kurt Lundgren has estimated that 7–10 hectares (17–25 acres) of hundred-year-old oak forest was required for the hull and several tall, stout pines for the masts and <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a>.

The construction of "Kronan" began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English shipwright <a href="Francis%20Sheldon">Francis Sheldon</a> frequently came in conflict with the admiralty over the project. The navy administrators complained that he was unduly delaying the project and was spending too much time on his own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the <a href="slipway">slipway</a> turned out to be too small and the rear section of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily mended and that the problem was that the timber had been left to dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged on for several years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.

As one of the largest ships of her time, "Kronan" had a sizable crew. When she sank there were 850 people on board – 500 sailors and 350 soldiers. Historians working with the excavation of the wreck site have compared the ship with a middle-sized Swedish town of the late 17th century, describing it as a "miniature society". On board were male representatives of both lower and upper classes. (Women were allowed on navy vessels only within the limits of Stockholm archipelago; before reaching the open sea, they had to disembark.) As a community afloat, "Kronan" mirrored the contemporary social standards of military and civilian life, two spheres that were not strictly separated in the 17th century.

The entire crew dressed in civilian clothing and there were no common navy uniforms. The Swedish army had only recently introduced standardized uniforms, something that was still uncommon in most of Europe. Clothing was differentiated according to social standing, with officers from the nobility dressed in elegant and expensive clothing while the ordinary crew dressed like laborers. The only exceptions were the soldiers of the <a href="V%C3%A4sterbottens%20regemente">Västerbotten infantry regiment</a> who had by the 1670s been equipped with the first "Carolingian" uniforms in blue and white. The crew was sometimes assigned clothing or cloth with which to prepare "sailor garb" ("båtmansklädning"), which set them apart from the usual dress of the general populace. Officers maintained a large collection of fine clothing for use on board, but it is not known if it was used during everyday work. Quite likely they owned a set of clothes made from simpler, more durable and more comfortable fabrics which were more practical at sea.

Recruitment was done by forced musters as part of the earlier form of the so-called <a href="Swedish%20allotment%20system">allotment system</a>. Sailors and gunners were supplied by a "båtsmanshåll" (literally "sailor household"), small administrative units in coastal regions that were assigned the task of supplying the fleet with one adult male for navy service. The soldiers on board were recruited from the army equivalents, "knekthåll" or "rotehåll", ("soldier" or "ward household") from inland areas. Officers originated mainly from the nobility or from the upper middle class, and were paid through the allotment system or the income from estates designated for the purpose. Higher-ranking officers most likely brought their personal servants on board. A valuable red jacket in bright red cloth that was worn by one of those who drowned on the ship could have belonged to one of these retinues.

After the Swedish loss at the <a href="battle%20of%20Fehrbellin">battle of Fehrbellin</a> in June 1675, the fleet was to support troop transports to reinforce <a href="Swedish%20Pomerania">Swedish Pomerania</a>. It had potential for success as it was equipped with several large, well-armed ships: "Svärdet" ("the sword") of 1,800 tonnes, "Äpplet" ("the <a href="globus%20cruciger">orb</a>") and "Nyckeln" ("the key"), both 1,400 tonnes, and the enormous "Kronan" ("the crown"). Altogether there were 28 large and medium warships and almost the same number of smaller vessels. The supply organization was lacking. There were few experienced high-ranking officers and internal cooperation was poor; Danish contemporaries scornfully described the Swedish Navy crews as mere "farmhands dipped in saltwater".

With "Kronan" as its flagship, the fleet went to sea in October 1675 under Admiral of the Realm ("riksamiral") <a href="Gustaf%20Otto%20Stenbock">Gustaf Otto Stenbock</a>, but got no farther than <a href="Stora%20Karls%C3%B6">Stora Karlsö</a> off <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>. The weather was unusually cold and stormy and the ships could not be heated. The crew were poorly clothed and soon many of them fell ill. Supplies dwindled, and after "Kronan" lost a bow anchor after less than two weeks at sea, Stenbock decided to turn back to the <a href="Dalar%C3%B6">Dalarö</a> anchorage north of Stockholm. Nothing came of the reinforcements of the North German provinces. King Charles reacted with anger and held Stenbock personally responsible for the failed expedition, forcing him to pay more than 100,000 dalers out of his own pocket. King Charles later rehabilitated Stenbock by giving him an army appointment in Norway, but in early 1676 he replaced him with <a href="Lorentz%20Creutz">Lorentz Creutz</a>, a prominent treasury official. Naval historian Jan Glete has explained this as a step that was "necessary in a time of crisis" due to Creutz's administrative skills and treasury connections, but Creutz had no experience as a naval commander, something that would later prove crucial.

As the situation for the Swedish army in Pomerania deteriorated during the winter of 1675–76, the fleet, with "Kronan" as flagship, was ordered to sea again in a desperate attempt to relieve the hard-pressed Swedish land forces. The weather was unusually cold and large parts of the Baltic were iced in. The fleet, now under the command of the seasoned sea officer <a href="Claes%20Uggla">Claes Uggla</a>, was blocked by ice when it reached Dalarö on 23 January. The <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20Sweden">Privy Councilor</a> Erik Lindschöld had been assigned by the King to assist with the expedition, and he came up with the idea of cutting the fleet out of the ice to reach the open sea. Hundreds of local peasants were ordered out to open a narrow channel through the ice with saws and picks to the anchorage at <a href="%C3%84lvsnabben">Älvsnabben</a>, more than 20 km (12 mi) away. On reaching the naval station on 14 February, three weeks later, it turned out that most of the sea outside the inner skerries was frozen as well. A storm hit the tightly packed ships and the ensuing movement of the ice crushed the hull of the supply vessel "Leoparden", sinking it. A Danish force had managed to reach the open waters farther off and observed the immobilized Swedish ships from a distance. When temperatures fell even further, the project was declared hopeless and Lindschöld gave up the attempt.

Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral <a href="Niels%20Juel">Niels Juel</a> left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left <a href="Visby">Visby</a>, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of <a href="R%C3%BCgen">Rügen</a> to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the <a href="battle%20of%20Bornholm%20%281676%29">battle of Bornholm</a>. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a <a href="fireship">fireship</a> and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.

After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off <a href="Trelleborg">Trelleborg</a> where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General <a href="Cornelis%20Tromp">Cornelis Tromp</a>, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a <a href="Beaufort%20scale">strong gale</a>. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the <a href="weather%20gage">weather gage</a> by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The Dutch ships of the allied fleet managed to sail <a href="close%20hauled">close-hauled</a> faster than the rest of the force and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, taking up the crucial weather gage. Later that morning the two fleets closed in on each other and were soon within firing range.

Around noon, some distance northeast of <a href="Hulterstad">Hulterstad</a>, the Swedish fleet made what the military historian Ingvar Sjöblom has described as "a widely debated maneuver". Because of misunderstandings and poorly coordinated signaling, the Swedish fleet attempted to turn and engage the allied fleet before they had sailed past the northern end of Öland, which had been agreed on before the battle. Sharp turns in rough weather were known to be perilous, especially for ships that had stability weaknesses. "Kronan" turned to port (left), but with too much sail, and heeled so far over that she began to flood through the open gunports. The crew was unable to correct the imbalance and the ship laid over completely with the masts parallel with the water. Soon after, the gunpowder store in the forward part of the "Kronan" ignited for unknown reasons and exploded, ripping apart a large section of the starboard side forward of the mainmast. The remaining section rose with the stern pointing up in the air and the broken-off front part toward the bottom. She then rapidly sank with the port side down. When the wreck hit the seabed, the hull suffered a major fracture along its side, further damaging the structure.
During this rapid sinking, a large proportion of the crew suffered severe trauma, as is shown by <a href="osteology">osteological</a> analyses of the skeletal remains. Many of the remains had deep, unhealed lacerations on skulls, vertebrae, ribs and other limbs. There are two primary theories about the cause of the injuries. Osteologist Ebba Düring has suggested that discipline and social cohesion collapsed during the sinking. The crew would have resorted to "all the means at their disposal, both physical as well as psychological" to escape the ship, an interpretation that is echoed by historian Ingvar Sjöblom. Medical historian Katarina Villner, on the other hand, has proposed that the injuries were caused by the sudden and violent chaos of the sinking itself, which would have thrown men, heavy equipment and cannons around.

The loss of the Admiral's flagship threw the Swedish forces into disorder, and soon "Svärdet", next in line as fleet flagship, was surrounded by the allied admirals and set ablaze by a Dutch fireship after an extended artillery duel. Only 50 of the 650-strong crew escaped the gun battle and the inferno, and among the dead was the acting Admiral Claes Uggla. After losing two of its highest ranking commanders as well as its two largest ships, the Swedish fleet fled in disarray. "Solen" later ran aground; "Järnvågen", "Neptunus" and three smaller vessels were captured. "Äpplet" later sank after breaking her moorings off Dalarö.

According to the artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak, only 40 men, including himself, survived the sinking: Major Johan Klerk, 2 trumpeters, 14 sailors and 22 soldiers, which means that more than 800 had perished. Among them were half a dozen navy and army officers as well as the chief physician of the Admiralty and the fleet <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a>. Altogether around 1,400 men died when "Kronan" and "Svärdet" were lost, and in the days following the battle, hundreds of corpses were washed up on the east coast of Öland. According to the <a href="vicar">vicar</a> of Långlöt parish, 183 men were taken from the beaches and buried at Hulterstad and Stenåsa graveyards. Lorentz Creutz's body was identified and shipped to his estate Sarvlax near the town of Loviisa, Finland, where it was buried. The losses were even worse since "Kronan" was the flagship and was manned with the best sailors and gunners in the fleet. When "Kronan" and "Svärdet" went down, they took with them the navy's entire stock of 30- and 36-pounder guns. Altogether over 300 tonnes of bronze guns worth nearly 250,000 silver <a href="Swedish%20riksdaler">dalers</a> went down with the ships, a sum that was slightly higher than the value of the ships themselves.

Within a week, the news of the failure at Bornholm and the disaster at Öland reached King Charles, who immediately ordered that a commission be set up to investigate the fiasco. Charles wanted to know if Bär and other officers were guilty of cowardice or incompetence. On 13 June the King wrote that "some of our sea officers have shown such cowardly and careless behavior [that they] have placed the safety, welfare and defense of the kingdom at great peril", and that "such a great crime should be sternly punished". The commission began its work on 7 June 1676 and finished in October 1677, without passing any sentences. Admiral Johan Bär of "Nyckeln" and Lieutenant Admiral Christer Boije, who ran aground with "Äpplet", were never again given a navy command. One of the accused, Hans Clerck of "Solen", was promoted to full admiral by the King even before the commission presented its findings.

Inappropriate handling in rough weather was the most obvious cause for "Kronan"s sinking. Unlike "Vasa", "Kronan"s sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During the work of the commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to "Vasa". He testified that "Kronan"s ballast had been lightened at Dalarö at the beginning of the campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.

Why the Swedish fleet deviated from the original plan of engaging the allied force in home waters north of Öland has never been satisfactorily explained. According to Rosenberg and Gyllenspak on "Kronan", Creutz made a turn because Uggla had signaled that he was going about. Rosenberg also believed that Bär on "Nyckeln", admiral of the first squadron, was first to make a turn, and that Uggla considered it necessary to follow this unplanned maneuver to keep the fleet together. Officers Anders Homman and Olof Norman, who both survived "Svärdet", claimed that only Creutz as fleet commander could have made such a decision and that Uggla was only following "Kronan"s lead. Witnesses who testified before the commission claimed that conflict between the officers was the reason that necessary precautions were not taken before "Kronan" came about. Rosenberg testified that Lieutenant Admiral Arvid Björnram and Major Klas Ankarfjäll had openly disagreed on how much sail should be set and how close to land the ship should sail. According to Gyllenspak, senior fleet pilot Per Gabrielsson had voiced his concerns against turning in the rough weather, but no one had heeded his advice.

Several scholars and authors have blamed Creutz for the loss of his ship, and he has been criticized as an incompetent sailor and officer who through lack of naval experience brought about the sinking. Historian Gunnar Grandin has suggested that the intent of the maneuver was to take advantage of the scattered allied fleet, but that many of the officers on "Kronan" opposed the idea; Creutz and Björnram urged that the ship turn quickly to gain a tactical advantage while Ankarfjäll and Gabrielsson were concerned about the immediate safety of the ship. Grandin has also suggested that Creutz may have suffered a mental breakdown after the failure at <a href="Battle%20of%20Bornholm%20%281676%29">Bornholm</a> and the open dispute with his officers, which led to a rash and ultimately fatal decision.

More recent views present the question of responsibility as more nuanced and complex – suggesting that Creutz cannot be singled out as solely responsible for the disaster. Historians Ingvar Sjöblom and Lars Ericson Wolke have pointed out that Creutz's position as admiral was comparable to that of a chief minister. He would have primarily been an administrator without the need for intimate knowledge of practical details; turning a ship in rough weather would have been the responsibility of his subordinates. Sjöblom has stressed that the disagreement between Major Ankarfjäll and Lieutenant Admiral Björnram on how much sail was needed wasted precious time in a situation where quick decisions were crucial. Creutz was also unique as a supreme commander of the navy since he had no experience of military matters. The Swedish naval officer corps in the late 17th century lacked the prestige of army commanders, and seasoned officers and even admirals could be outranked by inexperienced civilians or army commanders with little or no naval background. Maritime archaeologist Lars Einarsson has suggested that Creutz's "choleric and willful temperament" probably played a part, but that it could equally be blamed on an untrained and inexperienced crew and the open discord among the officers. According to Sjöblom it is still unclear to historians whether there was a designated ship commander on "Kronan" with overall responsibility.

The total cost of "Kronan" was estimated at 326,000 silver <a href="Swedish%20riksdaler">dalers</a> in contemporary currency, and about half of the cost, 166,000 dalers, lay in the armaments. It was therefore in the interest of the Swedish Navy to salvage as many of the cannons as possible. In the early 1660s almost all the guns from "Vasa" had been brought up through greatly improved technology. Commander Paul Rumpf and Admiral <a href="Hans%20Wachtmeister">Hans Wachtmeister</a> were put in charge of the salvage of "Kronan's" cannons. With the help of <a href="diving%20bell">diving bell</a>s, they were able to raise 60 cannons worth 67,000 daler in the summers (c. June–August) of 1679–86, beginning as soon as the war with Denmark had ended. In the 1960s, diving expert Bo Cassel made some successful descents to "Vasa" with a diving bell made according to 17th-century specifications. In 1986, further experiments were done on "Kronan". The tests proved successful and the conclusion was that the 17th-century operations must have required considerable experience, skill and favorable weather conditions. Though the conditions off Öland were often difficult, with cold water and unpredictable weather, and required a large crew, the expeditions were very profitable. Historian Björn Axel Johansson has calculated that the total cost for the entire crew for all eight diving seasons was less than 2,000 dalers, the value of one of "Kronan's" 36-pounder guns.

The marine engineer and amateur historian <a href="Anders%20Franz%C3%A9n">Anders Franzén</a> had searched for old Swedish wrecks in the Baltic since the 1940s and became nationally renowned after he located "Vasa" in 1956. "Kronan" was one of several famous shipwrecks on a list of potential wreck sites that he had compiled. For almost 30 years Franzén and others scoured archives and probed the seabed off the west coast of Öland. During the 1950s and 1960s the team searched off Hulterstad by dragging, and later followed up with sonar scans. In 1971 planks believed to belong to "Kronan" were located, but the lead could not be followed up properly at the time. Later in the 1970s the search area was narrowed down with a <a href="sidescan%20sonar">sidescan sonar</a> and a <a href="magnometer">magnometer</a>, an instrument that detects the presence of iron. With the two instruments the team pinned down a likely location, and in early August 1980, sent down underwater cameras to reveal the first pictures of "Kronan".

The remains of "Kronan" lie at a depth of 26 m (85 ft), 6 km (3.7 mi) east of Hulterstad, off the east coast of Öland. Since her rediscovery in 1980, there have been annual diving expeditions to the site of the wreck from June to August. By Baltic Sea standards, the conditions are good for underwater archaeological work; the wreck site is far from land, away from the regular shipping lanes, and has not been affected by pollution from the land or excessive growth of marine vegetation. The visibility, especially in early summer, is good and can be up to 20 m. The seabed consists of mostly infertile sand that reflects much of the sunlight from the surface, aiding the surveying and documentation of the site with underwater cameras. Around 85% of the wreck site has been charted so far and "Kronan" has become one of the most extensive and well-publicized maritime archaeological projects in the Baltic Sea.

More than 30,000 artifacts from "Kronan" have been salvaged and cataloged, ranging from bronze cannons of up to four tonnes to small eggshell fragments. There have been several discoveries of considerable importance, and some of unique historical and archaeological value. One of the first finds was a small table cabinet with nine drawers containing navigational instruments, pipe-cleaning tools, cutlery and writing utensils, which most likely belonged to one of the officers. As a flagship, "Kronan" carried a large amount of cash in the form of silver coins. Besides wages for the crew, a <a href="war%20chest">war chest</a> was required for large, unforeseen expenses. In 1982, a collection of 255 gold coins was found, most of them <a href="ducat">ducat</a>s. The origin of the individual coins varied considerably, with locations such as Cairo, Reval (modern-day Tallinn), and Seville. Another 46 ducats were found in 2000. The coin collection is probably the largest gold treasure ever encountered on Swedish soil, though it was not enough to cover large expenses, which has led to the assumption that they were the personal property of Admiral Lorentz Creutz. In 1989, more than 900 silver coins were found in the remains of the orlop, at the time the largest silver coin collection ever discovered in Sweden. In 2005, a much larger cache of nearly 6,200 coins was uncovered and in 2006 yet another with more than 7,000 coins. The silver treasure of 2005 consisted almost entirely of 4 <a href="%C3%B6re">öre</a>-coins minted in 1675, which represented over 1% of the entire production of 4 öre-coins of that year.
Several musical instruments have been found, including a trumpet, three violins and a <a href="viola%20da%20gamba">viola da gamba</a>, all expensive objects that probably belonged to either the officers or the trumpeters. One of the trumpeters on board was a member of the admiral's musical ensemble and it is assumed that one of the particularly fine, German-made instruments belonged to him. Another remnant of the officers' personal stores was discovered in 1997, consisting of a woven basket filled with tobacco and expensive imported foodstuffs and spices, including ginger, plums, grapes and cinnamon quills.

Approximately seven percent of the finds consist of textiles. Much of the clothing, particularly that of the officers and their personal servants, is well preserved and has provided information on clothing manufacture during the late 17th century, something that has otherwise been difficult to research based only on depictions.
