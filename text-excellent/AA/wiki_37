Burning of Parliament

The <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a>, the medieval royal palace used as the home of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British parliament</a>, was largely destroyed by fire on 16 October 1834. The blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden <a href="tally%20stick">tally stick</a>s which had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the <a href="Exchequer">Exchequer</a> until 1826. The sticks were disposed of carelessly in the two furnaces under the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, which caused a <a href="chimney%20fire">chimney fire</a> in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber and up through the walls.

The resulting fire spread rapidly throughout the complex and developed into the biggest <a href="conflagration">conflagration</a> in London between the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%20London">Great Fire</a> of 1666 and <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a> of the Second World War; the event attracted large crowds which included several artists who provided pictorial records of the event. The fire lasted for most of the night and destroyed a large part of the palace, including the converted <a href="St%20Stephen%27s%20Chapel">St Stephen's Chapel</a>—the meeting place of the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>—the Lords Chamber, the <a href="Painted%20Chamber">Painted Chamber</a> and the official residences of the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Speaker</a> and the <a href="Clerk%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons">Clerk of the House of Commons</a>.

The actions of Superintendent <a href="James%20Braidwood%20%28firefighter%29">James Braidwood</a> of the London Fire Engine Establishment ensured that <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a> and a few other parts of the old Houses of Parliament survived the blaze. In 1836 a competition for designs for a new palace was won by <a href="Charles%20Barry">Charles Barry</a>. Barry's plans, developed in collaboration with <a href="Augustus%20Pugin">Augustus Pugin</a>, incorporated the surviving buildings into the new complex. The competition established <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> as the predominant national architectural style and the palace has since been categorised as a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>, of outstanding universal value.

The <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> originally dates from the early eleventh century when <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Canute the Great</a> built his royal residence on the north side of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>. Successive kings added to the complex: <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> built <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>; <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> began building a new palace; his son, <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William Rufus</a>, continued the process, which included <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a>, started in 1097; <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III</a> built new buildings for the <a href="Exchequer">Exchequer</a>—the taxation and revenue gathering department of the country—in 1270 and the <a href="Court%20of%20Common%20Pleas%20%28England%29">Court of Common Pleas</a>, along with the <a href="Court%20of%20King%27s%20Bench%20%28England%29">Court of King's Bench</a> and <a href="Court%20of%20Chancery">Court of Chancery</a>. By 1245 the King's throne was present in the palace, which signified that the building was at the centre of English royal administration.

In 1295 Westminster was the venue for the <a href="Model%20Parliament">Model Parliament</a>, the first English representative assembly, summoned by <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I</a>; during his reign he called sixteen parliaments, which sat either in the <a href="Painted%20Chamber">Painted Chamber</a> or the <a href="White%20Chamber">White Chamber</a>. By 1332 the barons (representing the titled classes) and burgesses and citizens (representing the commons) began to meet separately, and by 1377 the two bodies were entirely detached. In 1512 a fire destroyed part of the royal palace complex and <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> moved the royal residence to the nearby <a href="Palace%20of%20Whitehall">Palace of Whitehall</a>, although Westminster still retained its status as a royal palace. In 1547 Henry's son, <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a>, provided <a href="St%20Stephen%27s%20Chapel">St Stephen's Chapel</a> for the Commons to use as their debating chamber. The House of Lords met in the medieval hall of the Queen's Chamber, before moving to the Lesser Hall in 1801. Over the three centuries from 1547 the palace was enlarged and altered, becoming a warren of wooden passages and stairways.

St Stephen's Chapel remained largely unchanged until 1692 when Sir <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a>, at the time the Master of the King's Works, was instructed to make structural alterations. He lowered the roof, removed the stained glass windows, put in a new floor and covered the original <a href="gothic%20architecture">gothic architecture</a> with wood panelling. He also added galleries from which the public could watch proceedings. The result was described by one visitor to the chamber as "dark, gloomy, and badly ventilated, and so small ... when an important debate occurred ... the members were really to be pitied". When the future <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a> remembered his arrival as a new MP in 1832, he recounted "What I may term corporeal conveniences were ... marvellously small. I do not think that in any part of the building it afforded the means of so much as washing the hands." The facilities were so poor that, in debates in 1831 and 1834, <a href="Joseph%20Hume">Joseph Hume</a>, a <a href="Radicals%20%28UK%29">Radical</a> MP, called for new accommodation for the House, while his fellow MP <a href="William%20Cobbett">William Cobbett</a> asked "Why are we squeezed into so small a space that it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm and regular discussion, even from circumstance alone ... Why are 658 of us crammed into a space that allows each of us no more than a foot and a half square?"

By 1834 the palace complex had been further developed, firstly by <a href="John%20Vardy">John Vardy</a> in the middle of the eighteenth century, and in the early nineteenth century by <a href="James%20Wyatt">James Wyatt</a> and <a href="John%20Soane">Sir John Soane</a>. Vardy added the Stone Building, in a <a href="Palladian%20architecture">Palladian</a> style to the West side of Westminster Hall; Wyatt enlarged the Commons, moved the Lords into the Court of Requests and rebuilt the Speaker's House. Soane, taking on responsibility for the palace complex on Wyatt's death in 1813, undertook rebuilding of Westminster Hall and constructed the Law Courts in a <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassical</a> style. Soane also provided a new royal entrance, staircase and gallery, as well as committee rooms and libraries.

The potential dangers of the building were apparent to some, as no fire stops or <a href="party%20wall">party wall</a>s were present in the building to slow the progress of a fire. In the late eighteenth century a committee of MPs predicted that there would be a disaster if the palace caught fire. This was followed by a 1789 report from fourteen architects warning against the possibility of fire in the palace; signatories included Soane and <a href="Robert%20Adam">Robert Adam</a>. Soane again warned of the dangers in 1828, when he wrote that "the want of security from fire, the narrow, gloomy and unhealthy passages, and the insufficiency of the accommodations in this building are important objections which call loudly for revision and speedy amendment." His report was again ignored.
Since medieval times the Exchequer had used <a href="tally%20stick">tally stick</a>s, pieces of carved, notched wood, normally willow, as part of their accounting procedures. The parliamentary historian Caroline Shenton has described the tally sticks as "roughly as long as the span of an index finger and thumb". These sticks were split in two so that the two sides to an agreement had a record of the situation. Once the purpose of each tally had come to an end, they were routinely destroyed. By the end of the eighteenth century the usefulness of the tally system had likewise come to an end, and a 1782 <a href="Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Act of Parliament</a> stated that all records should be on paper, not tallies. The Act also abolished <a href="sinecure">sinecure</a> positions in the Exchequer, but a clause in the act ensured it could only take effect once the remaining sinecure-holders had died or retired. The final sinecure-holder died in 1826 and the act came into force, although it took until 1834 for the antiquated procedures to be replaced. The novelist <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, in a speech to the Administrative Reform Association, described the retention of the tallies for so long as an "obstinate adherence to an obsolete custom"; he also mocked the bureaucratic steps needed to implement change from wood to paper. He said that "all the red tape in the country grew redder at the bare mention of this bold and original conception." By the time the replacement process had finished there were two cart-loads of old tally sticks awaiting disposal.

In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, received instructions from Treasury officials to clear the old tally sticks while parliament was <a href="Adjournment">adjourned</a>. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces ran up the walls of the basement in which they were housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, then up through the walls and out through the chimneys.

The process of destroying the tally sticks began at dawn on 16 October and continued throughout the day; two Irish labourers, Joshua Cross and Patrick Furlong, were assigned the task. Weobley checked in on the men throughout the day, claiming subsequently that, on his visits, both furnace doors were open, which allowed the two labourers to watch the flames, while the piles of sticks in both furnaces were only ever high. Another witness to the events, Richard Reynolds, the firelighter in the Lords, later reported that he had seen Cross and Furlong throwing handfuls of tallies onto the fire—an accusation they both denied.

Those tending the furnaces were unaware that the heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started a chimney fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven farther up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child <a href="chimney%20sweep">chimney sweep</a>s. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the fabric of the chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of <a href="Clinker%20%28waste%29">clinker</a> had built up inside the flues.

A strong smell of burning was present in the Lords' chambers during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00 pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that hung there were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. As they approached <a href="Black%20Rod">Black Rod</a>'s <a href="Box%20seat">box</a> in the corner of the room, they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00 pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left to go to the nearby Star and Garter public house.

Shortly after 5:00 pm, heat and sparks from a flue ignited the woodwork above.The first flames were spotted at 6:00 pm, under the door of the House of Lords, by the wife of one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning the curtains and wood panels, and raised the alarm. For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace initially panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did not call for assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, at the other end of the palace complex.

At 6:30 pm there was a <a href="flashover">flashover</a>, a giant ball of flame that "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" reported "burst forth in the centre of the House of Lords, ... and burnt with such fury that in less than half an hour, the whole interior ... presented ... one entire mass of fire." The explosion, and the resultant burning roof, lit up the skyline, and could be seen by the royal family in <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, away. Alerted by the flames, help arrived from nearby parish fire engines; as there were only two hand-pump engines on the scene, they were of limited use. They were joined at 6:45 pm by 100 soldiers from the <a href="Grenadier%20Guards">Grenadier Guards</a>, some of whom helped the police in forming a large square in front of the palace to keep the growing crowd back from the firefighters; some of the soldiers assisted the firemen in pumping the water supply from the engines.

The London Fire Engine Establishment (LFEE)—an organisation run by several insurance companies in the absence of a publicly run brigade—was alerted at about 7:00 pm, by which time the fire had spread from the House of Lords. The head of the LFEE, <a href="James%20Braidwood%20%28firefighter%29">James Braidwood</a>, brought with him 12 engines and 64 firemen, even though the Palace of Westminster was a collection of uninsured government buildings, and therefore fell outside the protection of the LFEE. Some of the firefighters ran their hoses down to the Thames. The river was at low tide and it meant a poor supply of water for the engines on the river side of the building.

By the time Braidwood and his men had arrived on the scene, the House of Lords had been destroyed. A strong south-westerly breeze had fanned the flames along the wood-panelled and narrow corridors into St Stephen's Chapel. Shortly after his arrival the roof of the chapel collapsed; the resultant noise was so loud that the watching crowds thought there had been a <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a>-style explosion. According to "The Manchester Guardian", "By half-past seven o'clock the engines were brought to play upon the building both from the river and the land side, but the flames had by this time acquired such a predominance that the quantity of water thrown upon them produced no visible effect." Braidwood saw it was too late to save most of the palace, so elected to focus his efforts on saving Westminster Hall, and he had his firemen cut away the part of the roof that connected the hall to the already burning Speaker's House, and then soak the hall's roof to prevent it catching fire. In doing so he saved the medieval structure at the expense of those parts of the complex already ablaze.

The glow from the burning, and the news spreading quickly round London, ensured that crowds continued to turn up in increasing numbers to watch the spectacle. Among them was a reporter for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", who noticed that there were "vast gangs of the light-fingered gentry in attendance, who doubtless reaped a rich harvest, and [who] did not fail to commit several desperate outrages". The crowds were so thick that they blocked <a href="Westminster%20Bridge">Westminster Bridge</a> in their attempts to get a good view, and many took to the river in whatever craft they could find or hire in order to watch better. A crowd of thousands congregated in <a href="Parliament%20Square">Parliament Square</a> to witness the spectacle, including the Prime Minister—<a href="William%20Lamb%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Melbourne">Lord Melbourne</a>—and many of his cabinet. <a href="Thomas%20Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a>, the Scottish philosopher, was one of those present that night, and he later recalled that:

This view was doubted by <a href="John%20Hobhouse%2C%201st%20Baron%20Broughton">Sir John Hobhouse</a>, the <a href="Commissioners%20of%20Woods%20and%20Forests">First Commissioner of Woods and Forests</a>, who oversaw the upkeep of royal buildings, including the Palace of Westminster. He wrote that "the crowd behaved very well; only one man was taken up for huzzaing when the flames increased. ... on the whole, it was impossible for any large assemblage of people to behave better." Many of the MPs and peers present, including <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</a>, helped break down doors to rescue books and other treasures, aided by passers-by; the <a href="Serjeant-at-Arms%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms</a> had to break into a burning room to save the <a href="Ceremonial%20mace%23British%20Parliament%20maces">parliamentary mace</a>.

At 9:00 pm three <a href="Guards%20Division">Guards</a> regiments arrived on the scene. Although the troops assisted in crowd control, their arrival was also a reaction of the authorities to fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the <a href="July%20Revolution">French</a>, <a href="Belgian%20Revolution">Belgian</a> and <a href="November%20Uprising">Polish</a> actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the <a href="Swing%20Riots">Captain Swing riots</a>, and the recent passing of the <a href="Poor%20Law%20Amendment%20Act%201834">Poor Law Amendment Act 1834</a>, which altered the relief provided by the <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a> system.

At around 1:30 am the tide had risen enough to allow the LFEE's floating fire engine to arrive on the scene. Braidwood had called for the engine five hours previously, but the low tide had hampered its progress from its downriver mooring at <a href="Rotherhithe">Rotherhithe</a>. Once it arrived it was effective in bringing under control the fire that had taken hold in the Speaker's House.

Braidwood regarded Westminster Hall as safe from destruction by 1:45 am, partly because of the actions of the floating fire engine, but also because a change in the direction of the wind kept the flames away from the Hall. Once the crowd realised that the hall was safe they began to disperse, and had left by around 3:00 am, by which time the fire near the Hall was nearly out, although it continued to burn towards the south of the complex. The firemen remained in place until about 5:00 am, when they had extinguished the last remaining flames and the police and soldiers had been replaced by new shifts.

The House of Lords, as well as its robing and committee rooms, were all destroyed, as was the Painted Chamber, and the connecting end of the Royal Gallery. The House of Commons, along with its library and committee rooms, the official residence of the Clerk of the House and the Speaker's House, were devastated. Other buildings, such as the Law Courts, were badly damaged. The buildings within the complex which emerged relatively unscathed included Westminster Hall, the cloisters and undercroft of St Stephen's, <a href="St%20Mary%20Undercroft">St Mary Undercroft Chapel</a>, the <a href="Jewel%20Tower">Jewel Tower</a> and Soane's new buildings to the south. The British <a href="standard%20%28metrology%29">standard measurements</a>, the <a href="yard">yard</a> and <a href="Pound%20%28mass%29%23Avoirdupois%20pound">pound</a>, were both lost in the blaze; the measurements had been created in 1496. Also lost were most of the procedural records for the House of Commons, which dated back as far as the late 15th century. The original Acts of Parliament from 1497 survived, as did the Lords' Journals, all of which were stored in the Jewel Tower at the time of the fire. In the words of Shenton, the fire was "the most momentous blaze in London between the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%20London">Great Fire</a> of 1666 and <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>" of the Second World War. Despite the size and ferocity of the fire, there were no deaths, although there were nine casualties during the night's events that were serious enough to require hospitalisation.

The day after the fire the Office of Woods and Forests issued a report outlining the damage, stating that "the strictest enquiry is in progress as to the cause of this calamity, but there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it has arisen from any other than accidental causes." "The Times" reported on some of the possible causes of the fire, but indicated that it was likely that the burning of the Exchequer tallies was to blame. The same day the <a href="Minister%20%28government%29">cabinet ministers</a> who were in London met for an emergency <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">cabinet meeting</a>; they ordered a list of witnesses to be drawn up, and on 22 October a committee of the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a> sat to investigate the fire.

The committee, which met in private, heard numerous theories as to the causes of the fire, including the lax attitude of plumbers working in the Lords, carelessness of the servants at Howard's Coffee House—situated inside the palace—and a gas explosion. Other rumours began to circulate; the Prime Minister received an anonymous letter claiming that the fire was an arson attack. The committee issued its report on 8 November, which identified the burning of the tallies as the cause of the fire. The committee thought it unlikely that Cross and Furlong had been as careful in filling the furnaces as they had claimed, and the report stated that "it is unfortunate that Mr Weobley did not more effectively superintend the burning of the tallies".
<a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King William IV</a> offered <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> as a replacement to parliament; the proposal was declined by MPs who considered the building "dingy". Parliament still needed somewhere to meet, and the Lesser Hall and Painted Chamber were re-roofed and furnished for the Commons and Lords respectively for the <a href="State%20Opening%20of%20Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a> on 23 February 1835. The opening included a statement from the King, read by <a href="Henry%20Brougham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brougham%20and%20Vaux">Lord Brougham</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, that <a href="legislative%20session%23Procedure%20in%20Commonwealth%20realms">prorogued</a> parliament until 25 November 1835.

Although the architect <a href="Robert%20Smirke%20%28architect%29">Robert Smirke</a> was appointed in December 1834 to design a replacement palace, pressure from the former MP Lieutenant Colonel Sir <a href="Edward%20Cust">Edward Cust</a> to open the process up to a competition gained popularity in the press and led to the formation in 1835 of a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>. This body determined in which style the new construction should be built, and in June they decided that either <a href="Elizabethan%20architecture">Elizabethan</a> or <a href="Gothic%20architecture">gothic</a> styles should be used. The commission also decided that although competitors would not be required to follow the outline of the original palace, the surviving buildings of Westminster Hall, the Undercroft Chapel and the Cloisters of St Stephen's should all be incorporated into the new complex.

There were 97 entries to the competition, which closed in November 1835; each entry was to be identifiable only by a pseudonym or symbol. The commission presented their recommendation in February 1836; the winning entry, which brought a prize of £1,500, was number 64, identified by a <a href="portcullis">portcullis</a>—the symbol chosen by the architect <a href="Charles%20Barry">Charles Barry</a>. Uninspired by any English secular Elizabethan or Gothic buildings, Barry had visited Belgium to view examples of Flemish civic architecture prior to drafting his design; to complete the necessary pen and ink drawings, which are now lost, he employed <a href="Augustus%20Pugin">Augustus Pugin</a>, a 23-year-old architect who was, in the words of the architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a>, "the most fertile and passionate of the Gothicists". Thirty four of the competitors petitioned parliament against the selection of Barry, who was a friend of Cust, but their plea was rejected, and the former prime minister Sir <a href="Robert%20Peel">Robert Peel</a> defended Barry and the selection process.

Barry planned an <a href="Enfilade%20%28architecture%29">enfilade</a>, or what Christopher Jones, the former BBC political editor, has called "one long spine of Lords' and Commons' Chambers" which enabled the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Speaker of the House of Commons</a> to look through the line of the building to see the Queen's throne in the House of Lords. Laid out around 11 courtyards, the building included several residences with accommodation for about 200 people, and comprised a total of 1,180 rooms, 126 staircases and of corridors. Between 1836 and 1837 Pugin made more detailed drawings on which estimates were made for the palace's completion; reports of the cost estimates vary from £707,000 to £725,000, with six years until completion of the project.

In June 1838 Barry and colleagues undertook a tour of Britain to locate a supply of stone for the building, eventually choosing <a href="Magnesian%20Limestone">Magnesian Limestone</a> from the <a href="Anston">Anston</a> quarry of the <a href="Duke%20of%20Leeds">Duke of Leeds</a>. Work started on building the river frontage on 1 January 1839, and Barry's wife laid the foundation stone on 27 April 1840. The stone was badly quarried and handled, and with the polluted atmosphere in London it proved to be problematic, with the first signs of deterioration showing in 1849, and extensive renovations required periodically.

Although there was a setback in progress with a <a href="stonemasons">stonemasons</a>' strike between September 1841 and May 1843, the House of Lords had its first sitting in the new chamber in 1847. In 1852 the Commons was finished, and both Houses sat in their new chambers for the first time; <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> first used the newly completed royal entrance. In the same year, while Barry was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a>, Pugin suffered a mental breakdown and, following incarceration at <a href="Bethlem%20Royal%20Hospital">Bethlehem Pauper Hospital for the Insane</a>, died at the age of 40.

The <a href="Big%20Ben">clock tower</a> was completed in 1858, and the <a href="Victoria%20Tower">Victoria Tower</a> in 1860; Barry died in May that year, before the building work was completed. The final stages of the work were overseen by his son, <a href="Edward%20Middleton%20Barry">Edward</a>, who continued working on the building until 1870. The total cost of the building came to around £2.5 million.

In 1836 the Royal Commission on Public Records was formed to look into the loss of the parliamentary records, and make recommendations on the preservation of future archives. Their published recommendations in 1837 led to the Public Record Act (1838), which set up the <a href="Public%20Record%20Office">Public Record Office</a>, initially based in <a href="Chancery%20Lane">Chancery Lane</a>.
The fire became the "single most depicted event in nineteenth-century London ... attracting to the scene a host of engravers, watercolourists and painters". Among them were <a href="J.M.W.%20Turner">J.M.W. Turner</a>, the landscape painter, who later produced <a href="The%20Burning%20of%20the%20Houses%20of%20Lords%20and%20Commons">two pictures of the fire</a>, and the <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> painter <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a>, who sketched the fire from a <a href="hansom%20cab">hansom cab</a> on Westminster Bridge.

The destruction of the standard measurements led to an overhaul of the British weights and measures system. An inquiry that ran from 1838 to 1841 considered the two competing systems used in the country, the <a href="avoirdupois">avoirdupois</a> and <a href="Troy%20weight">troy</a> measures, and decided that avoirdupois would be used forthwith; troy weights were retained solely for gold, silver and precious stones. The destroyed weights and measures were recast by <a href="William%20Simms%20%28instrument%20maker%29">William Simms</a>, the scientific instrument maker, who produced the replacements after "countless hours of tests and experiments to determine the best metal, the best shape of bar, and the corrections for temperature".

The Palace of Westminster has been a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> since 1987, and is classified as being of outstanding universal value. UNESCO describe the site as being "of great historic and symbolic significance", in part because it is "one of the most significant monuments of neo-Gothic architecture, as an outstanding, coherent and complete example of neo-Gothic style". The decision to use the Gothic design for the palace set the national style, even for secular buildings.

In 2015 the chairman of the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20Commission">House of Commons Commission</a>, <a href="John%20Thurso">John Thurso</a>, stated that the palace was in a "dire condition". The Speaker of the House of Commons, <a href="John%20Bercow">John Bercow</a>, agreed and said that the building was in need of extensive repairs. He reported that parliament "suffers from flooding, contains a great deal of asbestos and has fire safety issues", which would cost £3 billion to fix.

Tripura

Tripura () is a <a href="States%20and%20territories%20of%20India">state</a> in northeastern <a href="India">India</a>. The third-smallest state in the country, it covers and is bordered by <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> to the north, south, and west, and the Indian states of <a href="Assam">Assam</a> and <a href="Mizoram">Mizoram</a> to the east. In 2011 the state had 3,671,032 residents, constituting 0.3% of the country's population.

The area of modern 'Tripura' was ruled for several centuries by the <a href="Tripuri%20kingdom">Tripuri dynasty</a>. It was the independent <a href="princely%20state">princely state</a> of the <a href="Tripuri%20Kingdom">Tripuri Kingdom</a> under the protectorate of the <a href="British%20Raj">British Empire</a> which was known as Hill Tippera while the area annexed and ruled directly by <a href="British%20India">British India</a> was known as Tippera District (present <a href="Comilla%20District">Comilla District</a>). The independent Tripuri Kingdom (or Hill Tippera) joined the newly independent India in 1949. Ethnic strife between the indigenous <a href="Tripuri%20people">Tripuri people</a> and the migrant <a href="Bengali%20people">Bengali population</a> due to large influx of Bengali Hindu refugees and settlers from <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> led to tension and scattered violence since its integration into the country of India, but the establishment of an autonomous tribal administrative agency and other strategies have led to peace.

Tripura lies in a geographically disadvantageous location in India, as only one major highway, the <a href="National%20Highway%208%20%28India%29">National Highway 8</a>, connects it with the rest of the country. Five mountain ranges—<a href="Boromura">Boromura</a>, <a href="Atharamura">Atharamura</a>, <a href="Longtharai">Longtharai</a>, <a href="Shakhan">Shakhan</a> and <a href="Jampui%20Hills">Jampui Hills</a>—run north to south, with intervening valleys; <a href="Agartala">Agartala</a>, the capital, is located on a plain to the west. The state has a <a href="tropical%20savanna%20climate">tropical savanna climate</a>, and receives seasonal heavy rains from the <a href="southwest%20monsoon">south west monsoon</a>. Forests cover more than half of the area, in which <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> and <a href="cane%20%28grass%29">cane</a> tracts are common. Tripura has the highest number of <a href="primate">primate</a> species found in any Indian state. Due to its geographical isolation, economic progress in the state is hindered. Poverty and unemployment continue to plague Tripura, which has a limited infrastructure. Most residents are involved in agriculture and allied activities, although the service sector is the largest contributor to the state's gross domestic product.

According to 2011 census, Tripura is one of the most literate states in India with a literacy rate of 87.75%. Mainstream Indian cultural elements coexist with traditional practices of the ethnic groups, such as various dances to celebrate religious occasions, weddings and festivities; the use of locally crafted musical instruments and clothes; and the worship of regional deities. The sculptures at the archaeological sites <a href="Unakoti">Unakoti</a>, <a href="Pilak%2C%20Tripura">Pilak</a> and <a href="Devtamura">Devtamura</a> provide historical evidence of artistic fusion between organised and tribal religions. The Great Chinmoy in Agartala was the former royal abode of the Tripuri king.

The Sanskrit name of the state is linked to the Hindu goddess of beauty; <a href="Tripura%20Sundari">Tripura Sundari</a>, the presiding deity of the <a href="Tripura%20Sundari%20Temple">Tripura Sundari Temple</a> at <a href="Udaipur%2C%20Tripura">Udaipur</a>, one of the 51 "<a href="Shakti%20Peethas">Shakti Peethas</a>" (pilgrimage centres of "<a href="Shaktism">Shaktism</a>"), and to the legendary tyrant king Tripur, who reigned in the region. Tripur was the 39th descendant of <a href="Druhyu">Druhyu</a>, who belonged to the lineage of <a href="Yayati">Yayati</a>, a king of the <a href="Lunar%20Dynasty">Lunar Dynasty</a>.

There have been suggestions to the effect that the origin of the name Tripura is doubtful, raising the possibility that the Sanskritic form is just due to a <a href="folk%20etymology">folk etymology</a> of a Tibeto-Burman (<a href="Kokborok">Kokborok</a>) name. Variants of the name include "Tripra", "Tuipura" and "Tippera". A Kokborok etymology from "twi" (water) and "pra" (near) has been suggested; the boundaries of Tripura extended to the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> when the kings of the Tripra Kingdom held sway from the <a href="Garo%20Hills">Garo Hills</a> of <a href="Meghalaya">Meghalaya</a> to <a href="Rakhine%20State">Arakan</a>, the present Rakhine State of Burma; so the name may reflect vicinity to the sea.

Although there is no evidence of lower or middle <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> settlements in Tripura, <a href="Upper%20Paleolithic">Upper Paleolithic</a> tools made of fossil wood have been found in the <a href="Haora%20River">Haora</a> and <a href="Khowai%20River">Khowai</a> valleys. The Indian epic, the "<a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>"; ancient religious texts, the "<a href="Purana">Purana</a>s"; and the <a href="Edicts%20of%20Ashoka">Edicts of Ashoka</a> – stone pillar inscriptions of the emperor <a href="Ashoka">Ashoka</a> dating from the third century <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a> – all mention Tripura. An ancient name of Tripura is "Kirat Desh" (English: "The land of Kirat"), probably referring to the <a href="Kirata%20Kingdom">Kirata Kingdom</a>s or the more generic term <a href="Kirata">Kirata</a>. However, it is unclear whether the extent of modern Tripura is coterminous with "Kirat Desh". The region was under the rule of the Twipra Kingdom for centuries, although when this dates from is not documented. The "<a href="Rajmala">Rajmala</a>", a chronicle of Tripuri kings which was first written in the 15th century, provides a list of 179 kings, from antiquity up to Krishna Kishore Manikya (1830–1850), but the reliability of the "Rajmala" has been doubted.
The boundaries of the kingdom changed over the centuries. At various times, the borders reached south to the jungles of the <a href="Sundarbans">Sundarbans</a> on the Bay of Bengal; east to Burma; and north to the boundary of the <a href="Kamarupa">Kamarupa</a> kingdom in <a href="Assam">Assam</a>. There were <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20in%20the%20Indian%20subcontinent">several Muslim invasions</a> of the region from the 13th century onward, which culminated in <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal dominance</a> of the plains of the kingdom in 1733, although their rule never extended to the hill regions. The Mughals had influence over the appointment of the Tripuri kings.

Tripura became a <a href="princely%20state">princely state</a> during <a href="British%20Raj">British rule in India</a>. The kings had an estate in British India, known as Tippera district or <a href="Chakla%20%28administrative%20division%29">Chakla</a> Roshnabad (now the <a href="Comilla%20District">Comilla district</a> of Bangladesh), in addition to the independent area known as Hill Tippera, the present-day state. Udaipur, in the south of Tripura, was the capital of the kingdom, until the king Krishna Manikya moved the capital to <a href="Agartala">Old Agartala</a> in the 18th century. It was moved to the new city of Agartala in the 19th century. <a href="Bir%20Chandra%20Manikya">Bir Chandra Manikya</a> (1862–1896) modelled his administration on the pattern of <a href="British%20India">British India</a>, and enacted reforms including the formation of Agartala Municipal Corporation. In 1926,it became a part of <a href="Pakokku">Pakokku</a> Hill Tracts Districts of <a href="British%20Burma">British Burma</a> until 1948,January 4.

Following the <a href="independence%20of%20India">independence of India</a> in 1947, Tippera district – the estate in the plains of British India – became a part of <a href="East%20Pakistan">East Pakistan</a>, and Hill Tippera remained under a regency council until 1949. The <a href="Maharani">Maharani Regent</a> of Tripura signed the <a href="Tripura%20Merger%20Agreement">Tripura Merger Agreement</a> on 9 September 1949, as a result of which Tripura became a <a href="Part%20C%20State">Part C</a> state of India. It became a <a href="Union%20Territory">Union Territory</a>, without a legislature, in November 1956 and an elected ministry was installed in July 1963. The <a href="partition%20of%20India">geographic partition</a> that coincided with the independence of India resulted in major economic and infrastructural setbacks for the state, as road transport between the state and the major cities of India had to follow a more circuitous route. The road distance between <a href="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> and Agartala before the partition was less than , and increased to , as the route now avoided East Pakistan. The geo-political isolation was aggravated by an absence of rail transport.

Some parts of the state were shelled by the <a href="Pakistan%20Army">Pakistan Army</a> during the <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201971">Indo-Pakistani War of 1971</a>. Following the war, the Indian government reorganised the North East region to ensure effective control of the international borders – three new states came into existence on 21 January 1972: Meghalaya, Manipur, and Tripura. Since the partition of India, many <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="Bengali%20people">Bengalis</a> have migrated to Tripura as refugees from East Pakistan; settlement by Hindu Bengalis increased at the time of the <a href="Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> of 1971. Hindu Bengalis migrated to Tripura after 1949 to escape religious persecution in Muslim majority East Pakistan. Before independence, most of the population was indigenous;. Ethnic strife between the Tripuri tribe and the predominantly immigrant Bengali community led to scattered violence, and <a href="Insurgency%20in%20Northeast%20India%23Tripura">an insurgency</a> spanning decades. This gradually abated following the establishment of a <a href="Tripura%20Tribal%20Areas%20Autonomous%20District%20Council">tribal autonomous district council</a> and the use of strategic <a href="counter-insurgency">counter-insurgency</a> operations. Tripura remains peaceful, as of 2016.

Tripura is a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked</a> state in <a href="Northeast%20India">North East India</a>, where the seven contiguous states – <a href="Arunachal%20Pradesh">Arunachal Pradesh</a>, <a href="Assam">Assam</a>, <a href="Manipur">Manipur</a>, <a href="Meghalaya">Meghalaya</a>, <a href="Mizoram">Mizoram</a>, <a href="Nagaland">Nagaland</a> and Tripura – are collectively known as the <a href="Seven%20Sister%20States">Seven Sister States</a>. Spread over , Tripura is the third-smallest among the 29 <a href="States%20and%20territories%20of%20India">states in the country</a>, behind Goa and <a href="Sikkim">Sikkim</a>. It extends from 22°56'N to 24°32'N, and 91°09'E to 92°20'E. Its maximum extent measures about from north to south, and east to west. Tripura is bordered by the country of Bangladesh to the west, north and south; and the Indian states of Assam to the north east; and Mizoram to the east. It is accessible by <a href="National%20Highway%20%28India%29">national highways</a> passing through the <a href="Karimganj%20district">Karimganj district</a> of Assam and <a href="Mamit%20district">Mamit district</a> of Mizoram.

The physiography is characterised by hill ranges, valleys and plains. The state has five <a href="anticline">anticlinal</a> ranges of hills running north to south, from <a href="Boromura">Boromura</a> in the west, through <a href="Atharamura">Atharamura</a>, <a href="Longtharai">Longtharai</a> and <a href="Shakhan">Shakhan</a>, to the <a href="Jampui%20Hills">Jampui Hills</a> in the east. The intervening <a href="syncline">syncline</a>s are the Agartala–Udaipur, Khowai–Teliamura, Kamalpur–Ambasa, Kailasahar–Manu and Dharmanagar–Kanchanpur valleys. At an altitude of , <a href="Betlingchhip">Betling Shib</a> in the Jampui range is the state's highest point. The small isolated hillocks interspersed throughout the state are known as "tillas", and the narrow fertile alluvial valleys, mostly present in the west, are called "lungas". A number of rivers originate in the hills of Tripura and flow into Bangladesh. The Khowai, <a href="Dhalai%20River">Dhalai</a>, <a href="Manu%20River%2C%20Tripura">Manu</a>, <a href="Juri%20River">Juri</a> and <a href="Longai%20River">Longai</a> flow towards the north; the <a href="Gumti%20River%20%28Tripura%29">Gumti</a> to the west; and the <a href="Muhuri%20River">Muhuri</a> and <a href="Feni%20River">Feni</a> to the south west.

The <a href="lithostratigraphy">lithostratigraphy</a> data published by the <a href="Geological%20Survey%20of%20India">Geological Survey of India</a> dates the rocks, on the <a href="geologic%20time%20scale">geologic time scale</a>, between the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> <a href="epoch%20%28geology%29">epoch</a>, approximately 34 to 23 million <a href="Before%20Present">years ago</a>, and the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> epoch, which started 12,000 years ago. The hills have red <a href="laterite">laterite</a> soil that is porous. The <a href="flood%20plain">flood plain</a>s and narrow valleys are overlain by alluvial soil, and those in the west and south constitute most of the agricultural land. According to the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Standards">Bureau of Indian Standards</a>, on a scale ranging from in order of increasing susceptibility to earthquakes, the state lies in <a href="Earthquake%20hazard%20zoning%20of%20India">seismic zone V</a>.

The state has a <a href="tropical%20savanna%20climate">tropical savanna climate</a>, designated "Aw" under the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a>. The undulating topography leads to local variations, particularly in the hill ranges. The four main seasons are winter, from December to February; pre-monsoon or summer, from March to April; monsoon, from May to September; and post-monsoon, from October to November. During the monsoon season, the <a href="southwest%20monsoon">south west monsoon</a> brings heavy rains, which cause frequent floods. The average annual rainfall between 1995 and 2006 ranged from . During winter, temperatures range from , while in the summer they fall between . According to a <a href="United%20Nations%20Development%20Programme">United Nations Development Programme</a> report, the state lies in "very high damage risk" zone from wind and cyclones.

Like most of the Indian subcontinent, Tripura lies within the <a href="Indomalaya%20ecozone">Indomalaya ecozone</a>. According to the <a href="Biogeographic%20classification%20of%20India">Biogeographic classification of India</a>, the state is in the "North-East" biogeographic zone. In 2011 forests covered 57.73 per cent of the state. Tripura hosts three different types of ecosystems: mountain, forest and freshwater. The <a href="evergreen%20forest">evergreen forest</a>s on the hill slopes and the sandy river banks are dominated by species such as "<a href="Dipterocarpus">Dipterocarpus</a>", "<a href="Artocarpus">Artocarpus</a>", "<a href="Amoora">Amoora</a>", "<a href="Elaeocarpus">Elaeocarpus</a>", "<a href="Syzygium">Syzygium</a>" and "<a href="Eugenia">Eugenia</a>". Two types of <a href="Lower%20Gangetic%20plains%20moist%20deciduous%20forests">moist deciduous forests</a> comprise majority of the vegetation: moist deciduous mixed forest and Sal ("<a href="Shorea%20robusta">Shorea robusta</a>")-predominant forest. The interspersion of <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> and <a href="Arundo">cane</a> forests with deciduous and evergreen flora is a peculiarity of Tripura's vegetation. <a href="Grassland">Grassland</a>s and <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s are also present, particularly in the plains. <a href="Herbaceous%20plant">Herbaceous plant</a>s, shrubs, and trees such as "<a href="Albizia">Albizia</a>", "<a href="Barringtonia">Barringtonia</a>", "<a href="Lagerstroemia">Lagerstroemia</a>" and "<a href="Macaranga">Macaranga</a>" flourish in the swamps of Tripura. Shrubs and grasses include "<a href="Schumannianthus%20dichotoma">Schumannianthus dichotoma</a>" ("shitalpati"), "<a href="Phragmites">Phragmites</a>" and "<a href="Saccharum">Saccharum</a>" (sugarcane).

According to a survey in 1989–90, Tripura hosts 90 land mammal species from 65 genera and 10 orders, including such species as elephant ("Elephas maximus"), bear ("Melursus ursinus"), binturong ("<a href="Arctictis%20binturong">Arctictis binturong</a>"), wild dog ("<a href="Cuon%20alpinus">Cuon alpinus</a>"), porcupine ("<a href="Artherurus%20assamensis">Artherurus assamensis</a>"), barking deer ("<a href="Muntiacus%20muntjak">Muntiacus muntjak</a>"), sambar ("<a href="Cervus%20unicolor">Cervus unicolor</a>"), wild boar ("<a href="Sus%20scrofa">Sus scrofa</a>"), gaur ("<a href="Bos%20gaurus">Bos gaurus</a>"), leopard ("<a href="Panthera%20pardus">Panthera pardus</a>"), clouded leopard ("<a href="Neofelis%20nebulosa">Neofelis nebulosa</a>"), and many species of small cats and primates. Out of 15 free ranging primates of India, seven are found in Tripura; this is the highest number of primate species found in any Indian state. The wild buffalo ("<a href="Bubalus%20arnee">Bubalus arnee</a>") is extinct now. There are nearly 300 species of birds in the state.

<a href="Wildlife%20sanctuaries%20of%20India">Wildlife sanctuaries</a> of the state are <a href="Sipahijola%20Wildlife%20Sanctuary">Sipahijola</a>, <a href="Gumti%20Wildlife%20Sanctuary">Gumti</a>, <a href="Rowa%20Wildlife%20Sanctuary">Rowa</a> and <a href="Trishna%20Wildlife%20Sanctuary">Trishna</a> wildlife sanctuaries. <a href="National%20park%20of%20India">National parks</a> of the state are <a href="Clouded%20Leopard%20National%20Park">Clouded Leopard National Park</a> and <a href="Rajbari%20National%20Park">Rajbari National Park</a>. These protected areas cover a total of . Gumti is also an <a href="Important%20Bird%20Area">Important Bird Area</a>. In winter, thousands of migratory waterfowl throng Gumti and Rudrasagar lakes.

In January 2012, major changes were implemented in the administrative divisions of Tripura. Beforehand, there had been four districts – <a href="Dhalai">Dhalai</a> (headquarters <a href="Ambassa">Ambassa</a>), <a href="North%20Tripura">North Tripura</a> (headquarters <a href="Dharmanagar">Dharmanagar</a>), <a href="South%20Tripura">South Tripura</a> (headquarters <a href="Udaipur%2C%20Tripura">Udaipur, Tripura</a>), and <a href="West%20Tripura">West Tripura</a> (headquarters <a href="Agartala">Agartala</a>). Four new districts were carved out of the existing four in January 2012 – <a href="Khowai%20district">Khowai</a>, <a href="Unakoti%20district">Unakoti</a>, <a href="Sipahijala%20district">Sipahijala</a> and <a href="Gomati%20district">Gomati</a>. Six new subdivisions and five new blocks were also added. Each is governed by a <a href="district%20collector">district collector</a> or a district magistrate, usually appointed by the <a href="Indian%20Administrative%20Service">Indian Administrative Service</a>. The subdivisions of each district are governed by a <a href="Sub-Divisional%20Magistrate">sub-divisional magistrate</a> and each subdivision is further divided into blocks. The blocks consist of "<a href="Panchayat">Panchayat</a>"s (village councils) and town municipalities. As of 2012, the state had eight districts, 23 subdivisions and 58 development blocks. National census and state statistical reports are not available for all the new administrative divisions, as of March 2013. <a href="Agartala">Agartala</a>, the capital of Tripura, is the most populous city. Other major towns with a population of 10,000 or more (as per 2015 census) are <a href="Sabroom">Sabroom</a>, <a href="Dharmanagar">Dharmanagar</a>, <a href="Jogendranagar">Jogendranagar</a>, <a href="Kailashahar">Kailashahar</a>, <a href="Pratapgarh%2C%20Tripura">Pratapgarh</a>, <a href="Udaipur%2C%20Tripura">Udaipur</a>, <a href="Amarpur%2C%20Tripura">Amarpur</a>, <a href="Belonia%2C%20India">Belonia</a>, <a href="Gandhigram%2C%20Tripura">Gandhigram</a>, <a href="Kumarghat">Kumarghat</a>, <a href="Khowai">Khowai</a>, <a href="Ranirbazar">Ranirbazar</a>, <a href="Sonamura">Sonamura</a>, <a href="Bishalgarh">Bishalgarh</a>, <a href="Teliamura">Teliamura</a>, <a href="Mohanpur%2C%20Tripura">Mohanpur</a>, <a href="Melaghar">Melaghar</a>, <a href="Ambassa">Ambassa</a>, <a href="Kamalpur%2C%20Tripura">Kamalpur</a>, <a href="Bishramganj">Bishramganj</a>, <a href="Kathaliya">Kathaliya</a>, <a href="Santirbazar">Santirbazar</a> and <a href="Baxanagar">Baxanagar</a>.

Tripura is governed through a <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentary system</a> of <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democracy</a>, a feature it shares with other Indian states. <a href="Universal%20suffrage">Universal suffrage</a> is granted to residents. The Tripura government has three branches: executive, legislature and judiciary. The <a href="Tripura%20Legislative%20Assembly">Tripura Legislative Assembly</a> consists of elected members and special office bearers that are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in case of Speaker's absence. The Assembly is <a href="unicameral">unicameral</a> with 60 <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Legislative%20Assembly">Members of the Legislative Assembly</a> (MLA). The members are elected for a term of five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. The <a href="judiciary">judiciary</a> is composed of the <a href="Tripura%20High%20Court">Tripura High Court</a> and a system of lower courts. <a href="Executive%20%28government%29">Executive authority</a> is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the <a href="Chief%20Minister%20of%20Tripura">Chief Minister</a>. The Governor, the titular <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>, is appointed by the <a href="President%20of%20India">President of India</a>. The leader of the party or a coalition of parties with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor. The Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly.

Tripura sends two representatives to the <a href="Lok%20Sabha">Lok Sabha</a> (the <a href="lower%20house">lower house</a> of the <a href="parliament%20of%20India">parliament of India</a>) and one representative to the <a href="Rajya%20Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a> (parliament's <a href="upper%20house">upper house</a>). "Panchayats" (<a href="Local%20self-government%20in%20India">local self-governments</a>) elected by local body elections are present in many villages for self-governance. Tripura also has a unique tribal self-governance body, the <a href="Tripura%20Tribal%20Areas%20Autonomous%20District%20Council">Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council</a>. This council is responsible for some aspects of local governance in 527 villages with high density of the scheduled tribes.

The main political parties are the <a href="Bharatiya%20Janata%20Party">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> (BJP), the <a href="Left%20Front%20%28Tripura%29">Left Front</a>, the <a href="All%20India%20Trinamool%20Congress">All India Trinamool Congress</a> and <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a> along with regional parties like <a href="Indigenous%20People%27s%20Front%20of%20Tripura">IPFT</a> and <a href="Indigenous%20Nationalist%20Party%20of%20Twipra">INPT</a>. Until 1977, the state was governed by the Indian National Congress. The Left Front was in power from 1978 to 1988, and then again from 1993 to 2018. During 1988–1993, the Congress and <a href="Tripura%20Upajati%20Juba%20Samiti">Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti</a> were in a ruling coalition. In the <a href="Tripura%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election%2C%202013">Tripura Legislative Assembly election, 2013</a>, the Left Front won 50 out of 60 seats in the Assembly.. The <a href="Tripura%20Legislative%20Assembly%20election%2C%202018">2018 assembly election</a> resulted in loss for the <a href="Left%20Front%20%28Tripura%29">Left Front</a>. The <a href="Bharatiya%20Janata%20Party">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> won an overall majority in the state, resulting in the end of the Communist Party's uninterrupted twenty-five year rule. <a href="BJP">BJP</a> won 44 out of 60 seats in the Assembly by coalition with <a href="Indigenous%20People%27s%20Front%20of%20Tripura">IPFT</a>. <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20India%20%28Marxist%29">CPI (M)</a> only got 16 seats and <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a> lost by huge margins in all constituencies. 

Communism in the state had its beginnings in the pre-independence era, inspired by freedom struggle activities in <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>, and culminating in regional parties with communist leanings. It capitalised on the tribal dissatisfaction with the mainstream rulers, and has been noted for connection with the "sub-national or ethnic searches for identity".
Since the 1990s, there is an ongoing <a href="Tripuri%20nationalism">irredentist</a> <a href="Tripura%20rebellion">Tripura rebellion</a>, involving militant outfits such as the <a href="National%20Liberation%20Front%20of%20Tripura">National Liberation Front of Tripura</a> and the <a href="All%20Tripura%20Tiger%20Force">All Tripura Tiger Force</a> (ATTF); <a href="terrorism%20in%20India">terrorist</a> incidents involving the ATTF claimed a recorded number of 389 victims in the seven-year period of 1993 to 2000. The <a href="Armed%20Forces%20%28Special%20Powers%29%20Act">Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958</a> (AFSPA) was first enforced in Tripura on 16 February 1997 when terrorism was at its peak in the state. Ever since it was enforced in Tripura, the Act, as per its provisions, was reviewed and extended after every six months. However, in view of the improvement in the situation and fewer terrorist activities being reported, the Tripura government in June 2013 reduced operational areas of the AFSPA to 30 police station areas. The last six-month extension to AFSPA was given in November 2014, and after about 18 years of operation, it was repealed on 29 May 2015. The Twipra Students Federation (TSF) demanded that AFSPA be revoked in the state.

The state has <a href="Tripura%20Tribal%20Areas%20Autonomous%20District%20Council">one autonomous council</a>.

Tripura's gross state domestic product for 2010–11 was at constant price (2004–05), recording 5.71 per cent growth over the previous year. In the same period, the GDP of India was , with a growth rate of 8.55 per cent. Annual per capita income at current price of the state was , compared to the national per capita income . In 2009, the <a href="tertiary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy">tertiary sector of the economy</a> (service industries) was the largest contributor to the gross domestic product of the state, contributing 53.98 per cent of the state's economy compared to 23.07 per cent from the <a href="Primary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy">primary sector</a> (agriculture, forestry, mining) and 22.95 per cent from the <a href="Secondary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy">secondary sector</a> (industrial and manufacturing). According to the Economic Census of 2005, after agriculture, the maximum number of workers were engaged in retail trade (28.21 per cent of total non-agricultural workforce), followed by manufacturing (18.60 per cent), public administration (14.54 per cent), and education (14.40 per cent).

Tripura is an agrarian state with more than half of the population dependent on agriculture and allied activities. However, due to hilly terrain and forest cover, only 27 per cent of the land is available for cultivation. Rice, the major crop of the state, is cultivated in 91 per cent of the cropped area. According to the Directorate of Economics & Statistics, Government of Tripura, in 2009–10, potato, <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a>, <a href="Roselle%20%28plant%29">mesta</a>, <a href="pulse">pulse</a>s and <a href="jute">jute</a> were the other major crops cultivated in the state. <a href="Jackfruit">Jackfruit</a> and pineapple top the list of horticultural products. Traditionally, most of the indigenous population practised "<a href="Jhum%20cultivation">jhum</a>" method (a type of <a href="slash-and-burn">slash-and-burn</a>) of cultivation. The number of people dependent on "jhum" has declined over the years.

<a href="Fish%20farming">Pisciculture</a> has made significant advances in the state. At the end of 2009–10, the state produced a surplus of 104.3 million <a href="Juvenile%20fish">fish seeds</a>, primarily <a href="Catla">carp</a>. Rubber and tea are the important cash crops of the state. Tripura ranks second to Kerala in the production of natural rubber in the country. The state is known for its <a href="handicraft">handicraft</a>, particularly hand-woven cotton fabric, wood carvings, and bamboo products. High quality timber including <a href="Sal%20tree">sal</a>, <a href="Dipterocarpus">garjan</a>, <a href="teak">teak</a> and <a href="Gmelina%20arborea">gamar</a> are found abundantly in the forests of Tripura. Tata Trusts signed a pact with Government of Tripura in July 2015 to improve fisheries and dairy in the state.

The industrial sector of the state continues to be highly underdeveloped – <a href="Brick%23Methods%20of%20manufacture">brickfields</a> and tea industry are the only two organised sectors. Tripura has considerable reservoirs of natural gas. According to estimates by <a href="Oil%20and%20Natural%20Gas%20Corporation">Oil and Natural Gas Corporation</a> (ONGC), the state has 400 billion metres reserves of natural gas, with 16 billion metres is recoverable. ONGC produced 480 million metres natural gas in the state, in 2006–07. In 2011 and 2013, new large discoveries of natural gas were announced by ONGC. Tourism industry in the state is growing – the revenue earned in tourism sector crossed for the first time in 2009–10, and surpassed in 2010–11. Although Bangladesh is in a <a href="trade%20deficit">trade deficit</a> with India, its export to Tripura is significantly more than import from the state; a report in the newspaper "The Hindu" estimated Bangladesh exported commodities valued at about to the state in 2012, as opposed to "very small quantity" of import. Alongside legal international trade, unofficial and informal cross-border trade is rampant. In a research paper published by the <a href="Institute%20of%20Developing%20Economies">Institute of Developing Economies</a> in 2004, the dependence of Tripura's economy on that of Bangladesh was emphasised.

The economy of Tripura can be characterised by high rate of poverty, low capital formation, inadequate infrastructure facilities, geographical isolation and communication bottlenecks, inadequate exploration and use of forest and mineral resources, slow industrialisation and high unemployment. More than 50% of the population depends on agriculture for sustaining their livelihood. However agriculture and allied activities to Gross State Domestic Production (GSDP) is only 23%, this is primarily because of low capital base in the sector. Despite the inherent limitation and constraints coupled with severe resources for investing in basic infrastructure, this has brought consistence progress in quality of life and income of people cutting across all sections of society. The state government through its Tripura Industrial Policy and Tripura Industrial Incentives Scheme, 2012, has offered heavy subsidies in capital investment and transport, preferences in government procurement, waivers in tender processes and fees, yet the impact has been not much significant beyond a few industries being set up in the <a href="Bodhjungnagar%20Industrial%20Growth%20Center">Bodhjungnagar Industrial Growth Center</a>.

The <a href="Planning%20Commission%20%28India%29">Planning Commission</a> estimates the poverty rate of all North East Indian states by using head count ratio of Assam (the second largest state in North East India after Arunachal Pradesh ). According to 2001 Planning Commission assessment, 22 per cent of Tripura's rural residents were below the poverty line. However, Tripura government's independent assessment, based on consumption distribution data, reported that, in 2001, 55 per cent of the rural population was below the poverty line. Geographic isolation and communication bottleneck coupled with insufficient infrastructure have restricted economic growth of the state. High rate of poverty and unemployment continues to be prevalent.

Air<br>

<a href="Agartala%20Airport">Agartala Airport</a>, located 12 km northwest of Agartala at Singerbhil, is the second busiest airport in northeast India after Guwahati. There are direct flights to <a href="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>, <a href="Imphal">Imphal</a>, <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>, <a href="Shillong">Shillong</a>, <a href="Guwahati">Guwahati</a>, <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a>, <a href="Ahmedabad">Ahmedabad</a> and <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>. The major airlines are <a href="Air%20India">Air India</a> and <a href="Indigo%20Airlines">Indigo Airlines</a>. Passenger helicopter services are available between the capital and major towns (Kailashahar, Dharmanagar) as well as to more remote areas such as Kanchanpur, Belonia and Gandacherra.

Railway<br>

Agartala, came on India's railway map with the advent of the railways in the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">subcontinent</a> in 1853 but the link was broken when India was <a href="Partition%20of%20India">partitioned</a> in 1947. Railway service was established in Tripura in 1964 by constructing track from <a href="Lumding">Lumding</a> in Assam to <a href="Dharmanagar">Dharmanagar</a> and <a href="Kailasahar">Kailasahar</a> in Tripura but the track did not connect the state capital Agartala. Rail transport was absent in the state until 2008–09 when the railway track was extended to the capital Agartala. The metre gauge rail track was connected to <a href="Indian%20gauge">broad gauge</a> at Lumding. The major railways stations in this line are in Agartala, <a href="Dharmanagar">Dharmanagar</a>, and <a href="Kumarghat">Kumarghat</a>. This metre gauge track was converted to broad gauge in 2016 and now trains run from Agartala to <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> and <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>. The total length of this railway track in Tripura state is 153 km. It is a single line without electrification.

Extension of the railway line from Agartala to the southernmost town of <a href="Sabroom">Sabroom</a> at Bangladesh border is in progress. The 43 km long track from Agartala to <a href="Udaipur%2C%20Tripura">Udaipur-Tripura</a> railway station (station code UDPU) near Mata Tripura Sundari Temple has been commissioned and two trains run on this section. The 70 km long section from Udaipur-Tripura to Sabroom on the bank of <a href="Feni%20River">Feni River</a>, which separates Tripura from Bangladesh, is being constructed as of 2017.

A new railway line is being laid westwards from Agartala to <a href="Akhaura">Akhaura</a> in <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>. This will reduce the distance between Agartala and <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> by over 1000 km and provide rail access to <a href="Chittagong">Chittagong</a> port.

Road<br>

Only one major road, the <a href="National%20Highway%208%20%28India%29">National Highway 8</a> (NH-8), connects Tripura to the rest of India. Starting at <a href="Sabroom">Sabroom</a> in southern Tripura, it heads north to the capital Agartala, turns east and then north-east to enter the state of Assam. Locally known as "Assam Road", the NH-8 is often called the lifeline of Tripura. However, the highway is single lane and of poor quality; often landslides, rains or other disruptions on the highway cut the state off from its neighbours. Another National Highway, <a href="National%20Highway%208A%20%28India%29">NH 108</a>, connects the town <a href="Panisagar%2C%20Tripura">Panisagar</a> in North Tripura District with <a href="Aizawl">Aizawl</a>, Mizoram. The <a href="Tripura%20Road%20Transport%20Corporation">Tripura Road Transport Corporation</a> is the government agency overlooking public transport on road. A hilly and land-locked state, Tripura is dependent mostly on roads for transport. The total length of roads in the state is of which national highways constitute and state highways , as of 2009–10. Residents in rural areas frequently use waterways as a mode of transport.

Tripura has an long international border with Bangladesh, of which is fenced, as of 2012. Several locations along the border serve as bilateral trading points between India and Bangladesh, such as Akhaura near Agartala, Raghna, Srimantpur, Belonia, Khowai and Kailasahar. A <a href="Transport%20between%20India%20and%20Bangladesh">bus service</a> exists between Agartala and <a href="Dhaka">Dhaka</a>, the capital of Bangladesh. In 2013, the two countries signed an agreement to establish a railway link between Agartala and <a href="Akhaura%20Upazila%23Railways%20and%20transportation">the Akhaura junction</a> of Bangladesh. Citizens of both countries need <a href="visa%20%28document%29">visa</a> to legally enter the other country; however, illegal movement and smuggling across the border are widespread.

<a href="Doordarshan">Doordarshan</a> (DD) has a television station in Agartala.
Akash Tripura, is one of the first television channels in Agartala. It is a full-time Agartala-based news channel. Other full-time based channels are Headlines Tripura, News Vanguard, Prime Television Network.

As of 2014, 56 daily and weekly newspapers are published in Tripura. Most of the newspapers are published in Bengali, except for one Kokborok daily ("<a href="Hachukni%20Kok">Hachukni Kok</a>"), one Manipuri weekly ("Marup"), two English dailies and three bilingual weeklies. Notable dailies include "<a href="Ajkal%20Tripura">Ajkal Tripura</a>", "<a href="Daily%20Desher%20Katha">Daily Desher Katha</a>", "<a href="Dainik%20Sambad">Dainik Sambad</a>" and "<a href="Syandan%20Patrika">Syandan Patrika</a>". and popular news portal www.tripurachronicle.in In a study by <a href="Indian%20Institute%20of%20Mass%20Communication">Indian Institute of Mass Communication</a> in 2009, 93 per cent of the sampled in Tripura rated television as very effective for information and mass education. In the study, 67 per cent of the sampled listened to radio and 80–90 per cent read newspaper. Most of the major Indian telecommunication companies are present in the state, such as <a href="Bharti%20Airtel">Airtel</a>, <a href="Aircel">Aircel</a>, <a href="Vodafone">Vodafone</a>, <a href="Reliance%20Communications">Reliance</a>, <a href="Jio">Jio</a>, <a href="Idea">Idea</a> and <a href="BSNL">BSNL</a>. Mobile connections outnumber landline connections by a wide margin. As of 2011, the state-controlled BSNL has 57,897 landline subscribers and GSM mobile service connections. There are 84 telephone exchanges (for landlines) and 716 post offices in the state, as of 2011.

Till 2014, Tripura was a power deficit state. In late 2014, Tripura reached surplus electricity production capacity by using its recently discovered natural gas resources, and installing high efficiency gas turbine power plants. The state has many power-generating stations. These are owned by Tripura State Electricity Corporation (TSECL), natural gas-powered <a href="thermal%20power%20station">thermal power station</a>s at Rokhia and Baramura, and the <a href="ONGC%20Tripura%20Power%20Company">ONGC Tripura Power Company</a> in Palatana. The ONGC plant has a capacity of 726.6 MW, with the second plant's commissioning in November 2014. It is the largest individual power plant in the northeast region.

The state also has a <a href="Hydroelectricity">hydro power</a> station on the Gumti River. The combined power generation from these three stations is 100–105 <a href="Megawatt">MW</a>. The <a href="North%20Eastern%20Electric%20Power%20Corporation%20Limited">North Eastern Electric Power Corporation</a> (NEEPCO) operates the 84 MW Agartala Gas Turbine Power Plant near Agartala. As of November 2014, another thermal power plant is being built at Monarchak.

With the newly added power generation capacity, Tripura has with enough capacity to supply all seven sister states of northeast India, as well export power to neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh. With recent discoveries, the state has abundant natural gas reserves to support many more power generation plants, but lacks pipeline and transport infrastructure to deliver the fuel or electricity to India's national grid.

As of 2011, of land in Tripura cultivable, of which has the potential to be covered by irrigation projects. However, only is irrigated. The state lacks major irrigation projects; it depends on medium-sized projects sourced from Gumti, Khowai (at Chakmaghat) and Manu rivers, and minor projects administered by village-level governing bodies that utilise <a href="tube%20well">tube well</a>s, water pumps, tanks and <a href="lift%20irrigation">lift irrigation</a>.

ONGC and Chambal Fertilizers & Chemicals are jointly building a fertiliser plant to leverage ONGC's natural gas discoveries in Tripura. Expected to be in operation by 2017, the 1.3 million tonnes per year plant will supply the northeastern states.

<a href="http%3A//www.dwstripura.in/dws/Index.aspx">Drinking Water and Sanitation (DWS) wing</a> of <a href="http%3A//pwd.tripura.gov.in/pwd/index.php/">Public Works Department</a> manages the drinking water supply in the state. Schools and Anganwadi Centers have been specifically targeted to improve drinking water supply as well as attendance to these institutions. Many areas of Tripura have the problem of excessive iron content in groundwater requiring the installation of Iron Removal Plants (IRP). Tripura State has received the best State Award for Water & Sanitation under the category of Small States in the IBN7 Diamond State Award function for doing commendable work to provide drinking water supply to the people with the sparsely distributed tribal population in hamlets of hilly region of the State. However, a study by the DWS Department found depleting water table and excessive contamination. Still, packaged drinking water under brands "Tribeni", "Eco Freshh", "Blue Fina", "Life Drop" and "Aqua Zoom" among others is manufactured and sold in the state. Filters of many types and brands, in addition to locally manufactured ceramic type filters, are sold in the state although their acceptance in rural areas is less.

Tripura has high incidence of open defecation, especially in the interior hilly and forest areas. The state has extensively implemented <a href="Nirmal%20Bharat%20Abhiyan">Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan</a> and currently the <a href="Swachh%20Bharat%20Abhiyan">Swachh Bharat Abhiyan</a> and convergence with MGNREGS to address this problem. Schools and Anganwadi Center are focussed to provide with urinals and latrines, separate for boys and girls aling with baby friendly toilets in Anganwadi Centers to inculcate the habit of using sanitary latrines in young age. However many toilets lie dysfuncational due to lack of maintenance and damage. Earlier schemes of providing plastic squatting plates, free of cost to people, has not produced results as most of them lie unused as many people cannot afford to construct a toilet. <a href="Open%20defecation">Open defecation</a> has created problems of diarrhoea and vulnerability to malaria. The Chief Minister of Tripura has envisioned to make the state Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2017.

Per 2011 census, the literacy rate of Tripura was 87.75 percent, the fourth-highest in India (which had a national literacy rate of 74.04 percent).

The National Family Health Survey – 3 conducted in 2005–06 revealed that 20 per cent of the residents of Tripura do not generally use government health facilities, and prefers private medical sector. This is overwhelmingly less compared to the national level, where 65.6 per cent do not rely on government facilities. As in the rest of India, Tripura residents also cite poor quality of care as the most frequent reason for non-reliance over public health sector. Other reasons include distance of the public sector facility, long waiting time, and inconvenient hours of operation. As of 2010, the state's performance in major public health care indices, such as birth rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate is better than the national average. The state is vulnerable to epidemics of <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, <a href="Japanese%20encephalitis">Japanese encephalitis</a> and <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>. In summer 2014 the state witnessed a major malaria outbreak.

Tripura ranks second to Assam as the most populous state in <a href="Northeast%20India">North East India</a>.

The indigenous people of the state i.e., ethnic <a href="Tripuri%20people">Tripuris</a> are mostly <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>. <a href="Mog%20people">Mogs</a> (Barua & Mutsuddy also comes under Mog community) and <a href="Chakma%20people">Chakmas</a> (who were indigenous people of <a href="Chindwin%20River">Chindwin valley</a> in Arakan Roma) are the followers of <a href="Theravada">Theravada</a> Buddhism in Tripura.

Christianity is chiefly followed by members of the <a href="Lusei%20tribe">Lushai</a>, Kuki, Garo, Tripuri, Halam tribes and as per 2017 census has 159,882 adherents.

The diverse ethno-linguistic groups of Tripura have given rise to a composite culture. The dominant ethnic groups are <a href="Bengali%20culture">Bengali</a>, <a href="Tripuri%20people">Tripuri</a> (<a href="Debbarma">Debbarma</a>, Tripura, Jamatia, Reang, <a href="Noatia">Noatia</a>, <a href="Koloi">Koloi</a>, <a href="Murasing">Murasing</a>, Chakma, <a href="Halam%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Halam</a>, Garo, Kuki, <a href="Mizo%20people">Mizo</a>, <a href="Uchoi">Uchoi</a>, Dhamai, Roaza, <a href="Mogh">Mogh</a>), and other tribal groups such as Munda, <a href="Oraon">Oraon</a> and <a href="Santhal%20people">Santhal</a> who migrated in Tripura as a tea labourers. Bengali people represent the largest ethno-linguist community of the state. Bengali culture, as a result, is the main non-indigenous, non-Tripura culture. The Tripuri Maharajas were great patrons of Bengali culture, especially literature; <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali language</a> replaced <a href="Kokborok">Kokborok</a> as the language of the court. Elements of Bengali culture, such as <a href="Bengali%20literature">Bengali literature</a>, <a href="Bengali%20music">Bengali music</a>, and <a href="Bengali%20cuisine">Bengali cuisine</a> are widespread, particularly in the urban areas of the state.

Tripura is noted for bamboo and cane handicrafts. Bamboo, wood and cane are used to create an array of furniture, utensils, hand-held fans, replicas, mats, baskets, idols and interior decoration materials. Music and dance are integral to the culture of the state. Some local musical instruments are the "<a href="sarinda">sarinda</a>", "<a href="Musical%20instruments%20of%20Tripura%23Chongpreng">chongpreng</a>" (both string instruments), and "<a href="sumui">sumui</a>" (a type of <a href="flute">flute</a>).

Cattle egret

The cattle egret ("Bubulcus ibis") is a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan</a> species of <a href="heron">heron</a> (<a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Ardeidae">Ardeidae</a>) found in the tropics, subtropics, and warm-temperate zones. It is the only member of the <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> genus Bubulcus, although some authorities regard two of its subspecies as full species, the <a href="western%20cattle%20egret">western cattle egret</a> and the <a href="eastern%20cattle%20egret">eastern cattle egret</a>. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus "<a href="Egretta">Egretta</a>", it is more closely related to the herons of "<a href="Ardea%20%28genus%29">Ardea</a>". Originally native to parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, it has undergone a rapid expansion in its <a href="range%20%28biology%29">distribution</a> and successfully <a href="Colonisation%20%28biology%29">colonised</a> much of the rest of the world in the last century.

It is a white bird adorned with buff <a href="feather">plumes</a> in the breeding season. It nests in <a href="bird%20colony">colonies</a>, usually near bodies of water and often with other <a href="wading%20bird">wading bird</a>s. The <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a> is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands, and rice paddies. They often <a href="Commensalism">accompany</a> cattle or other large <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, catching insect and small <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations are <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> and others show postbreeding <a href="Biological%20dispersal">dispersal</a>.

The adult cattle egret has few <a href="predators">predators</a>, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks may be lost to starvation, calcium deficiency, or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with <a href="cattle">cattle</a>, which extends to other large <a href="grazing">grazing</a> mammals; wider human farming is believed to be a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes <a href="tick">tick</a>s and <a href="flies">flies</a> from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.

The cattle egret was first described in 1758 by <a href="Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="Systema%20naturae">Systema naturae</a>" as "Ardea ibis", but was moved to its current genus by <a href="Charles%20Lucien%20Bonaparte">Charles Lucien Bonaparte</a> in 1855. Its genus name "Bubulcus" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for herdsman, referring, like the English name, to this species' association with cattle. "Ibis" is a Latin and <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word which originally referred to another white wading bird, the <a href="sacred%20ibis">sacred ibis</a>, but was applied to this species in error.

The cattle egret has two geographical races, which are sometimes classified as full species, the western cattle egret, "B. ibis", and eastern cattle egret, "B. coromandus". The two forms were split by McAllan and Bruce, but were regarded as <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a> by almost all other recent authors until the publication of the influential "<a href="Birds%20of%20South%20Asia.%20The%20Ripley%20Guide">Birds of South Asia</a>". The eastern subspecies "B. (i.) coromandus", described by <a href="Pieter%20Boddaert">Pieter Boddaert</a> in 1783, breeds in Asia and Australasia, and the western nominate form occupies the rest of the species range, including the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>. Some authorities recognise a third <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a> subspecies, "B. i. seychellarum", which was first described by <a href="Finn%20Salomonsen">Finn Salomonsen</a> in 1934.

Despite superficial similarities in appearance, the cattle egret is more closely related to the genus "<a href="Ardea%20%28genus%29">Ardea</a>", which comprises the great or typical herons and the <a href="great%20egret">great egret</a> ("A. alba"), than to the majority of species termed egrets in the genus "<a href="Egretta">Egretta</a>". Rare cases of <a href="hybridisation%20in%20birds">hybridization</a> with <a href="little%20blue%20heron">little blue heron</a>s "Egretta caerulea", <a href="little%20egret">little egret</a>s "Egretta garzetta" and <a href="snowy%20egret">snowy egret</a>s "Egretta thula" have been recorded.

The cattle egret is a stocky <a href="heron">heron</a> with an wingspan; it is long and weighs . It has a relatively short, thick neck, a sturdy <a href="beak">bill</a>, and a hunched posture. The nonbreeding adult has mainly white plumage, a yellow bill, and greyish-yellow legs. During the breeding season, adults of the nominate western subspecies develop orange-buff <a href="plume%20%28feather%29">plumes</a> on the back, breast, and <a href="crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a>, and the bill, legs, and <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a> become bright red for a brief period prior to pairing. The sexes are similar, but the male is marginally larger and has slightly longer breeding plumes than the female; juvenile birds lack coloured plumes and have a black bill.

"B. i. coromandus" differs from the <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a> in breeding plumage, when the buff colour on its head extends to the cheeks and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> are longer on average than in "B. i. ibis". "B. i. seychellarum" is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white cheeks and throat, like "B. i. ibis", but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with "B. i. coromandus". Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.

The positioning of the egret's eyes allows for <a href="binocular%20vision">binocular vision</a> during feeding, and physiological studies suggest that the species may be capable of <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a> or nocturnal activity. Adapted to foraging on land, they have lost the ability possessed by their wetland relatives to accurately correct for light <a href="refraction">refraction</a> by water.

This species gives a quiet, throaty "rick-rack" call at the breeding colony, but is otherwise largely silent.

The cattle egret has undergone one of the most rapid and wide-reaching natural expansions of any bird species. It was originally native to parts of southern <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, tropical and subtropical <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, and humid tropical and subtropical <a href="Asia">Asia</a>. At the end of the 19th century, it began expanding its range into southern Africa, first breeding in the <a href="Cape%20Province">Cape Province</a> in 1908. Cattle egrets were first sighted in the Americas on the boundary of <a href="French%20Guiana">Guiana</a> and <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a> in 1877, having apparently flown across the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. In the 1930s, the species is thought to have become established in that area.

The species first arrived in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> in 1941 (these early sightings were originally dismissed as escapees), bred in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> in 1953, and spread rapidly, breeding for the first time in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> in 1962. It is now commonly seen as far west as <a href="California">California</a>. It was first recorded breeding in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> in 1957, in <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a> in 1958, and in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> in 1963, although it was probably established before then. In Europe, the species had historically declined in Spain and Portugal, but in the latter part of the 20th century, it expanded back through the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, and then began to colonise other parts of Europe, southern <a href="France">France</a> in 1958, northern France in 1981, and <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in 1985. Breeding in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> was recorded for the first time in 2008, only a year after an influx seen in the previous year. In 2008, cattle egrets were also reported as having moved into <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> for the first time. This trend has continued and cattle egrets have become more numerous in southern Britain with influxes in some numbers during the nonbreeding seasons of 2007/08 and 2016/17. They bred in Britain again in 2017, following an influx in the previous winter, and may become established there.

In Australia, the colonisation began in the 1940s, with the species establishing itself in the north and east of the continent. It began to regularly visit <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> in the 1960s. Since 1948, the cattle egret has been permanently resident in <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. Prior to 1948, it was only a winter visitor.

The massive and rapid expansion of the cattle egret's <a href="range%20%28biology%29">range</a> is due to its relationship with humans and their <a href="domesticated%20animals">domesticated animals</a>. Originally adapted to a <a href="commensal">commensal</a> relationship with large grazing and browsing animals, it was easily able to switch to domesticated cattle and horses. As the keeping of livestock spread throughout the world, the cattle egret was able to occupy otherwise empty <a href="ecological%20niche">niche</a>s. Many populations of cattle egrets are highly <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> and dispersive, and this has helped the species' range expansion. The species has been seen as a vagrant in various sub-Antarctic islands, including <a href="South%20Georgia%20Island">South Georgia</a>, <a href="Marion%20Island">Marion Island</a>, the <a href="South%20Sandwich%20Islands">South Sandwich Islands</a>, and the <a href="South%20Orkney%20Islands">South Orkney Islands</a>. A small flock of eight birds was also seen in <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> in 2008.

In addition to the natural expansion of its range, cattle egrets have been <a href="introduced%20species">deliberately introduced</a> into a few areas. The species was introduced to <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> in 1959, and to the <a href="Chagos%20Archipelago">Chagos Archipelago</a> in 1955. Successful releases were also made in the <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a> and <a href="Rodrigues%20%28island%29">Rodrigues</a>, but attempts to introduce the species to <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> failed. Numerous birds were also released by <a href="Whipsnade%20Zoo">Whipsnade Zoo</a> in England, but the species was never established.

Although the cattle egret sometimes feeds in shallow water, unlike most herons it is typically found in fields and dry grassy habitats, reflecting its greater dietary reliance on terrestrial insects rather than aquatic prey.

Some populations of cattle egrets are migratory, others are dispersive, and distinguishing between the two can be difficult. In many areas, populations can be both <a href="sedentary">sedentary</a> and migratory. In the Northern Hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but cattle egrets nesting in Australia migrate to cooler <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and New Zealand in the winter and return in the spring. Migration in western Africa is in response to rainfall, and in South America, migrating birds travel south of their breeding range in the nonbreeding season. Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>s. They move north from <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a> after September. During winter, many birds have been seen flying at night with flocks of <a href="Indian%20pond%20heron">Indian pond heron</a>s ("Ardeola grayii") on the south-eastern coast of India and a winter influx has also been noted in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.

Young birds are known to disperse up to from their breeding area. Flocks may fly vast distances and have been seen over seas and oceans including in the middle of the Atlantic.
This species has a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of . Its global population estimated to be 3.8–6.7 million individuals. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>. The expansion and establishment of the species over large ranges, though, has led it to be classed as an <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> (although little, if any impact has been noted yet).

The cattle egret nests in <a href="Bird%20colony">colonies</a>, which are often found around bodies of water. The colonies are usually found in woodlands near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises, and <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s. The breeding season varies within <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>. Nesting in northern <a href="India">India</a> begins with the onset of monsoons in May. The breeding season in <a href="Australia">Australia</a> is November to early January, with one brood laid per season. The North American breeding season lasts from April to October. In the <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a>, the breeding season of "B.i. seychellarum" is April to October.

The male displays in a tree in the colony, using a range of <a href="ritual">ritual</a>ised behaviours, such as shaking a twig and sky-pointing (raising his bill vertically upwards), and the pair forms over 3–4 days. A new mate is chosen in each season and when renesting following nest failure. The nest is a small, untidy platform of sticks in a tree or shrub constructed by both parents. Sticks are collected by the male and arranged by the female, and stick-stealing is rife. The <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> size can be one to five eggs, although three or four is most common. The pale bluish-white eggs are oval-shaped and measure . <a href="Avian%20incubation">Incubation</a> lasts around 23 days, with both sexes sharing incubation duties. The chicks are partly covered with <a href="down%20feather">down</a> at hatching, but are <a href="Nidicolous">not capable of fending for themselves</a>; they become capable of <a href="Thermoregulation">regulating their temperature</a> at 9–12 days and are fully feathered in 13–21 days. They begin to leave the nest and climb around at 2 weeks, <a href="fledge">fledge</a> at 30 days and become independent at around the 45th day.

The cattle egret engages in low levels of <a href="brood%20parasitism">brood parasitism</a>, and a few instances have been reported of cattle egret eggs being laid in the nests of <a href="snowy%20egret">snowy egret</a>s and <a href="little%20blue%20heron">little blue heron</a>s, although these eggs seldom hatch. Also, evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism has been found, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% <a href="extra-pair%20copulation">extra-pair copulation</a>s has been noted.

The dominant factor in nesting mortality is starvation. Sibling rivalry can be intense, and in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, third and fourth chicks inevitably starve. In the dryer habitats with fewer amphibians, the diet may lack sufficient vertebrate content and may cause bone abnormalities in growing chicks due to calcium deficiency. In <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, nests were sometimes raided by <a href="vervet%20monkey">vervet monkey</a>s, and a study in Florida reported the <a href="fish%20crow">fish crow</a> and <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> as other possible nest raiders. The same study attributed some nestling mortality to <a href="brown%20pelican">brown pelican</a>s nesting in the vicinity, which accidentally, but frequently, dislodged nests or caused nestlings to fall. In Australia, <a href="Torresian%20crow">Torresian crow</a>s, <a href="wedge-tailed%20eagle">wedge-tailed eagle</a>s, and <a href="white-bellied%20sea%20eagle">white-bellied sea eagle</a>s take eggs or young, and <a href="tick">tick</a> infestation and <a href="virus">viral</a> infections may also be causes of mortality.

The cattle egret feeds on a wide range of prey, particularly <a href="insect">insect</a>s, especially <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s, <a href="cricket%20%28insect%29">crickets</a>, <a href="fly">flies</a> (adults and maggots), and <a href="moth">moth</a>s, as well as <a href="spider">spider</a>s, <a href="frog">frog</a>s, and <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s. In a rare instance, they have been observed foraging along the branches of a <a href="banyan">banyan</a> tree for ripe figs. The species is usually found with <a href="cattle">cattle</a> and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that cattle egret foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6 times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. Its performance is similar when it follows <a href="farm%20machinery">farm machinery</a>, but it is forced to move more. In urban situations, cattle egrets have also been observed foraging in peculiar situations such as railway lines.

A cattle egret will weakly defend the area around a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets, it will give up and continue foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15 steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind <a href="plains%20zebra">plains zebra</a>s, <a href="waterbuck">waterbuck</a>, <a href="blue%20wildebeest">blue wildebeest</a> and <a href="Cape%20buffalo">Cape buffalo</a>. <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">Dominant</a> birds feed nearest to the host, and thus obtain more food.

The cattle egret sometimes shows versatility in its diet. On islands with <a href="seabird%20colony">seabird colonies</a>, it will prey on the eggs and chicks of <a href="tern">tern</a>s and other <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s. During <a href="bird%20migration">migration</a>, it has also been reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Birds of the Seychelles race also indulge in some <a href="kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a>, chasing the chicks of <a href="sooty%20tern">sooty tern</a>s and forcing them to disgorge food.

A conspicuous species, the cattle egret has attracted many <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s. These mostly relate to its habit of following cattle and other large animals, and it is known variously as cow crane, cow bird or cow heron, or even elephant bird or rhinoceros egret. Its <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> name, "abu qerdan", means "father of ticks", a name derived from the huge number of parasites such as avian ticks found in its breeding colonies. The <a href="Maasai%20people">Maasai people</a> consider the presence of large numbers of cattle egrets as an indicator of impending drought and use it to decide on moving their cattle herds.

The cattle egret is a popular bird with cattle <a href="rancher">rancher</a>s for its perceived role as a <a href="biocontrol">biocontrol</a> of cattle <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s such as <a href="tick">tick</a>s and <a href="fly">flies</a>. A study in Australia found that cattle egrets reduced the number of flies that bothered cattle by pecking them directly off the skin. It was the benefit to stock that prompted ranchers and the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry to release the species in Hawaii.

Not all interactions between humans and cattle egrets are beneficial. The cattle egret can be a safety hazard to aircraft due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of airports, and it has been implicated in the spread of animal infections such as <a href="heartwater">heartwater</a>, <a href="infectious%20bursal%20disease">infectious bursal disease</a>, and possibly <a href="Newcastle%20disease">Newcastle disease</a>.

Barton Fink

Barton Fink is a 1991 American <a href="period%20piece">period</a> film written, produced, directed and edited by the <a href="Coen%20brothers">Coen brothers</a>. Set in 1941, it stars <a href="John%20Turturro">John Turturro</a> in the title role as a young New York City <a href="playwright">playwright</a> who is hired to write scripts for a film studio in Hollywood, and <a href="John%20Goodman">John Goodman</a> as Charlie, the insurance salesman who lives next door at the run-down Hotel Earle.

The Coens wrote the screenplay for "Barton Fink" in three weeks while experiencing difficulty during the writing of "<a href="Miller%27s%20Crossing">Miller's Crossing</a>". They began filming the former soon after "Miller's Crossing" was finished. The film is influenced by works of several earlier directors, particularly <a href="Roman%20Polanski">Roman Polanski</a>'s "<a href="Repulsion%20%28film%29">Repulsion</a>" (1965) and "<a href="The%20Tenant">The Tenant</a>" (1976).

"Barton Fink" had its premiere at the <a href="1991%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> in May 1991. In a rare sweep, it won the <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a>, as well as awards for <a href="Best%20Director%20Award%20%28Cannes%20Film%20Festival%29">Best Director</a> and <a href="Best%20Actor%20Award%20%28Cannes%20Film%20Festival%29">Best Actor</a> (Turturro). Although the film was a box office disappointment, only grossing $6 million against its $9 million budget, it received positive reviews and was nominated for 3 <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>. Prominent themes of "Barton Fink" include the writing process; slavery and conditions of labor in creative industries; superficial distinctions between <a href="high%20culture">high culture</a> and <a href="low%20culture">low culture</a>; and the relationship of intellectuals with "the common man".

The diverse elements of the film have led it to defy efforts at genre classification, with the work being variously referred to as a <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>, a <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a>, a "<a href="K%C3%BCnstlerroman">Künstlerroman</a>", and a <a href="buddy%20film">buddy film</a>. It contains various literary allusions and religious overtones, as well as references to many real-life people and events – most notably the writers <a href="Clifford%20Odets">Clifford Odets</a> and <a href="William%20Faulkner">William Faulkner</a>, of whom the characters of Barton Fink and W. P. Mayhew, respectively, are often seen as fictional representations. Several features of the film's narrative, particularly an image of a woman at the beach which recurs throughout, have sparked much commentary, with the Coens acknowledging some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any single message in the film. Despite disagreement over certain details of the work, "Barton Fink" continues to be positively received, with screenwriter <a href="Charlie%20Kaufman">Charlie Kaufman</a> among its admirers.

In 1941, Barton Fink's first <a href="Broadway%20theater">Broadway</a> play, "Bare Ruined Choirs", has achieved critical and popular success. His agent informs him that Capitol Pictures in Hollywood has offered him a thousand dollars per week to write film scripts. Barton hesitates, worried that moving to California would separate him from "the common man", his focus as a writer. He accepts the offer, however, and checks into the Hotel Earle, a large and unusually deserted building. His room is sparse and draped in subdued colors; its only decoration is a small painting of a woman on the beach, arm raised to block the sun.

In his first meeting with Capitol Pictures boss Jack Lipnick, Barton explains that he chose the Earle because he wants lodging that is (as Lipnick says) "less Hollywood". Lipnick promises that his only concern is Barton's writing ability and assigns his new employee to a wrestling film. Back in his room, however, Barton is unable to write. He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to complain. His neighbor, Charlie Meadows, is the source of the noise and visits Barton to apologize, insisting on sharing some alcohol from a hip flask to make amends. As they talk, Barton proclaims his affection for "the common man", and Charlie describes his life as an insurance salesman. Later, Barton falls asleep, but is awakened by the incessant whine of a mosquito.

Still unable to proceed beyond the first lines of his script, Barton consults producer Ben Geisler for advice. Irritated, the frenetic Geisler takes him to lunch and orders him to consult another writer for assistance. While in the men's room, Barton meets the novelist William Preston (W.P.) "Bill" Mayhew, who is vomiting in the next stall. They briefly discuss movie writing and arrange a second meeting later in the day. When Barton arrives, Mayhew is drunk and yelling wildly. His secretary, Audrey Taylor, reschedules the meeting and confesses to Barton that she and Mayhew are in love. When they finally meet for lunch, Mayhew, Audrey, and Barton discuss writing and drinking. Before long, Mayhew argues with Audrey, slaps her, and wanders off, drunk. Rejecting Barton's offer of consolation, Audrey explains that she feels sorry for Mayhew since he is married to another woman who is "disturbed".
With one day left before his meeting with Lipnick to discuss the movie, Barton phones Audrey and begs her for assistance. She visits him at the Earle, and after she admits that she wrote most of Mayhew's scripts, they apparently have sex; Barton later confesses to Charlie they did so. When Barton awakens the next morning, he, again, hears the sound of the mosquito, finds it on Audrey's back, and slaps it dead. When Audrey does not respond, Barton turns her onto her side only to find that she has been violently murdered. He has no memory of the night's events. Horrified, he summons Charlie and asks for help. Charlie is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Barton to avoid contacting the police. After a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Barton tries writing again and is interrupted by Charlie, who announces he is going to New York for several days. Charlie leaves a package with Barton and asks him to watch it.

Soon afterward, Barton is visited by two police detectives, who inform him that Charlie's real name is Karl "Madman" Mundt. Mundt is a serial killer wanted for several murders; after shooting his victims, they explain, he decapitates them and keeps the heads. Stunned, Barton returns to his room and examines the box. Placing it on his desk without opening it, he begins writing and produces the entire script in one sitting. After a night of celebratory dancing, Barton returns to find the detectives in his room, who, after handcuffing Barton to the bed, reveal they've found evidence of Mundt's latest murders. Each of the men notes how hot it is, before Charlie returns as the hotel is engulfed in flames. Running through the hallway, screaming "I'll show you the life of the mind!", Charlie shoots the policemen with a shotgun. As the hallway burns, Charlie speaks with Barton about their lives and the hotel, breaks the bed frame to which Barton is handcuffed (thus freeing him), then retires to his own room, saying as he goes that he paid a visit to Barton's parents and uncle in New York. Barton leaves the still-burning hotel, carrying the box and his script. Shortly thereafter he attempts to telephone his family, but there is no answer.

In a final meeting, a disappointed Lipnick, in uniform (as he attempts to secure an <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Reserve">Army Reserve</a> commission), angrily chastises Barton for writing "a fruity movie about suffering" then informs him that he is to remain in Los Angeles; although Barton will remain under contract, Capitol Pictures will not produce anything he writes so he can be ridiculed as a loser around the studio while Lipnick is in the war. Dazed, Barton wanders onto a beach, still carrying the package. He meets a woman who looks just like the one in the picture on his wall at the Earle, and she asks about the box. He tells her he does not know what it contains nor who owns it. She then assumes the pose from the picture.

In 1989, filmmakers <a href="Coen%20brothers">Joel and Ethan Coen</a> began writing the script for a film eventually released as "<a href="Miller%27s%20Crossing">Miller's Crossing</a>". The many threads of the story became complicated, and after four months they found themselves lost in the process. Although biographers and critics later referred to it as <a href="writer%27s%20block">writer's block</a>, the Coen brothers rejected this description. "It's not really the case that we were suffering from writer's block," Joel said in a 1991 interview, "but our working speed had slowed, and we were eager to get a certain distance from "Miller's Crossing"." They went from Los Angeles to New York and began work on a different project.
In three weeks, the Coens wrote a script with a title role written specifically for actor <a href="John%20Turturro">John Turturro</a>, with whom they'd been working on "Miller's Crossing". The new film, "Barton Fink", was set in a large, seemingly abandoned hotel. This setting, which they named the "Hotel Earle", was a driving force behind the story and mood of the new project. While filming their 1984 film "<a href="Blood%20Simple">Blood Simple</a>" in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, the Coens had seen a hotel which made a significant impression: "We thought, 'Wow, Motel Hell.' You know, being condemned to live in the weirdest hotel in the world."

The writing process for "Barton Fink" was smooth, they said, suggesting that the relief of being away from "Miller's Crossing" may have been a catalyst. They also felt satisfied with the overall shape of the story, which helped them move quickly through the composition. "Certain films come entirely in one's head; we just sort of burped out "Barton Fink"." While writing, the Coens created a second leading role with another actor in mind: John Goodman, who had appeared in their 1987 comedy "<a href="Raising%20Arizona">Raising Arizona</a>". His new character, Charlie, was Barton's next-door neighbor in the cavernous hotel. Even before writing, the Coens knew how the story would end, and wrote Charlie's final speech at the start of the writing process.

The script served its diversionary purpose, and the Coens put it aside: ""Barton Fink" sort of washed out our brain and we were able to go back and finish "Miller's Crossing"." Once production of the first film was finished, the Coens began to recruit staff to film "Barton Fink". Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: "I felt I could bring something more human to Barton. Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution. I tried to go a little further than they expected."

As they designed detailed <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>s for "Barton Fink", the Coens began looking for a new <a href="Cinematography">cinematographer</a>, since their associate <a href="Barry%20Sonnenfeld">Barry Sonnenfeld</a> – who had filmed their first three films – was occupied with his own directorial debut, "<a href="The%20Addams%20Family%20%281991%20film%29">The Addams Family</a>". The Coens had been impressed with the work of English cinematographer <a href="Roger%20Deakins">Roger Deakins</a>, particularly the interior scenes of the 1988 film "<a href="Stormy%20Monday%20%28film%29">Stormy Monday</a>". After screening other films he had worked on (including "<a href="Sid%20and%20Nancy">Sid and Nancy</a>" and "<a href="Pascali%27s%20Island%20%28film%29">Pascali's Island</a>"), they sent a script to Deakins and invited him to join the project. His agent advised against working with the Coens, but Deakins met with them at a café in <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a> and they soon began working together on "Barton Fink".

<a href="Principal%20photography">Filming</a> began in June 1990 and took eight weeks (a third less time than required by "Miller's Crossing"), and the estimated final budget for the film was US$9 million. The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film. "There was only one moment we surprised him," Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a <a href="tracking%20shot">tracking shot</a> out of the bedroom and into a sink drain "plug hole" in the adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse. "The shot was a lot of fun and we had a great time working out how to do it," Joel said. "After that, every time we asked Roger to do something difficult, he would raise an eyebrow and say, 'Don't be having me track down any plug-holes now.'"

Three weeks of filming were spent in the Hotel Earle, a set created by art director <a href="Dennis%20Gassner">Dennis Gassner</a>. The film's climax required a huge spreading fire in the hotel's hallway, which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in <a href="post-production">post-production</a>. When they decided to use real flames, however, the crew built a large alternative set in an abandoned aircraft <a href="hangar">hangar</a> at <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach</a>. A series of gas jets were installed behind the hallway, and the wallpaper was perforated for easy penetration. As Goodman ran through the hallway, a man on an overhead <a href="Catwalk%20%28theater%29">catwalk</a> opened each jet, giving the impression of a fire racing ahead of Charlie. Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus, and a second hallway (sans fire) stood ready nearby for filming <a href="Pick-up%20%28filmmaking%29">pick-up</a> shots between takes. The final scene was shot near <a href="Zuma%20Beach">Zuma Beach</a>, as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock.

The Coens edited the film themselves, as is their custom. "We prefer a hands-on approach," Joel explained in 1996, "rather than sitting next to someone and telling them what to cut." Because of rules for membership in film production <a href="guild">guild</a>s, they are required to use a pseudonym; "Roderick Jaynes" is credited with editing "Barton Fink". Only a few filmed scenes were removed from the final cut, including a transition scene to show Barton's movement from New York to Hollywood. (In the film, this is shown enigmatically with a wave crashing against a rock.) Several scenes representing work in Hollywood studios were also filmed, but edited out because they were "too conventional".

There is a sharp contrast between Fink's living quarters and the polished, pristine environs of Hollywood, especially the home of Jack Lipnick. The spooky, inexplicably empty feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the Coens' conception of the film. "We wanted an <a href="Art%20Deco">art deco</a> stylization", Joel explained in a 1991 interview, "and a place that was falling into ruin after having seen better days". Barton's room is sparsely furnished with two large windows facing another building. The Coens later described the hotel as a "ghost ship floating adrift, where you notice signs of the presence of other passengers, without ever laying eyes on any". In the film, residents' shoes are an indication of this unseen presence; another rare sign of other inhabitants is the sound from adjacent rooms. Joel said: "You can imagine it peopled by failed commercial travelers, with pathetic sex lives, who cry alone in their rooms".

Heat and moisture are other important elements of the setting. The wallpaper in Barton's room peels and droops; Charlie experiences the same problem and guesses heat is the cause. The Coens used green and yellow colors liberally in designing the hotel "to suggest an aura of putrefaction".

The atmosphere of the hotel was meant to connect with the character of Charlie. As Joel explained: "Our intention, moreover, was that the hotel function as an exteriorization of the character played by John Goodman. The sweat drips off his forehead like the paper peels off the walls. At the end, when Goodman says that he is a prisoner of his own mental state, that this is like some kind of hell, it was necessary for the hotel to have already suggested something infernal." The peeling wallpaper and the paste which seeps through it also mirror Charlie's chronic ear infection and the resultant pus.

When Barton first arrives at the Hotel Earle, he is asked by the friendly bellhop Chet (<a href="Steve%20Buscemi">Steve Buscemi</a>) if he is "a trans or a res" – transient or resident. Barton explains that he isn't sure but will be staying "indefinitely". The dichotomy between permanent inhabitants and guests reappears several times, notably in the hotel's motto, "A day or a lifetime", which Barton notices on the room's stationery. This idea returns at the end of the film, when Charlie describes Barton as "a tourist with a typewriter". His ability to leave the Earle (while Charlie remains) is presented by critic Erica Rowell as evidence that Barton's story represents the process of writing itself. Barton, she says, represents an author who is able to leave a story, while characters like Charlie cannot.
In contrast, the offices of Capitol Pictures and Lipnick's house are pristine, lavishly decorated, and extremely comfortable. The company's rooms are bathed in sunlight, and Ben Geisler's office faces a lush array of flora. Barton meets Lipnick in one scene beside an enormous, spotless swimming pool. This echoes his position as studio head, as he explains: "...you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town ... if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it." In his office, Lipnick showcases another trophy of his power: statues of <a href="Atlas%20%28mythology%29">Atlas</a>, the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titan</a> of Greek mythology who declared war on the gods of <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> and was severely punished.

Barton watches <a href="dailies">dailies</a> from another wrestling film being made by Capitol Pictures; the date on the <a href="clapperboard">clapperboard</a> is December 9, two days after the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. Later, when Barton celebrates the completed script by dancing at a <a href="United%20Service%20Organizations">USO</a> show, he is surrounded by soldiers. In Lipnick's next appearance, he wears a colonel's uniform, which is really a costume from his company. Lipnick has not actually entered the military but declares himself ready to fight the "little yellow bastards". Originally, this historical moment just after the United States entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> was to have a significant impact on the Hotel Earle. As the Coens explained: "[W]e were thinking of a hotel where the lodgers were old people, the insane, the physically handicapped, because all the others had left for the war. The further the script was developed, the more this theme got left behind, but it had led us, in the beginning, to settle on that period."

The picture in Barton's room of a woman at the beach is a central focus for both the character and camera. He examines it frequently while at his desk, and after finding Audrey's corpse in his bed he goes to stand near it. The image is repeated at the end of the film, when he meets an identical-looking woman at an identical-looking beach, who strikes an identical pose. After complimenting her beauty, he asks her: "Are you in pictures?" She blushes and replies: "Don't be silly."

The Coens decided early in the writing process to include the picture as a key element in the room. "Our intention," Joel explained later, "was that the room would have very little decoration, that the walls would be bare and that the windows would offer no view of any particular interest. In fact, we wanted the only opening on the exterior world to be this picture. It seemed important to us to create a feeling of isolation."

Later in the film, Barton places into the frame a small picture of Charlie, dressed in a fine suit and holding a briefcase. The juxtaposition of his neighbor in the uniform of an insurance salesman and the escapist image of the woman on the beach leads to a confusion of reality and fantasy for Barton. Critic Michael Dunne notes: "[V]iewers can only wonder how 'real' Charlie is. ... In the film's final shot ... viewers must wonder how 'real' [the woman] is. The question leads to others: How real is Fink? Lipnick? Audrey? Mayhew? How real are films anyway?"

The picture's significance has been the subject of broad speculation. "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" reviewer Desson Howe said that despite its emotional impact, the final scene "feels more like a punchline for punchline's sake, a trumped-up coda". In her book-length analysis of the Coen brothers' films, Rowell suggests that Barton's fixation on the picture is ironic, considering its <a href="low%20culture">low culture</a> status and his own pretensions toward <a href="high%20culture">high culture</a> (speeches to the contrary notwithstanding). She further notes that the camera focuses on Barton himself as much as the picture while he gazes at it. At one point, the camera moves past Barton to fill the frame with the woman on the beach. This tension between objective and subjective points of view appears again at the end of the film, when Barton finds himself – in a sense – inside the picture.

Critic M. Keith Booker calls the final scene an "enigmatic comment on representation and the relationship between art and reality". He suggests that the identical images point to the absurdity of art which reflects life directly. The film transposes the woman directly from art to reality, prompting confusion in the viewer; Booker asserts that such a literal depiction therefore leads inevitably to uncertainty.

Many critics noted that "<a href="The%20Law%20of%20Non-Contradiction">The Law of Non-Contradiction</a>", an episode of the Coen-produced TV series "<a href="Fargo%20%28TV%20series%29">Fargo</a>" based on their <a href="Fargo%20%28film%29">eponymous 1996 film</a>, features a reference to the picture, as the episode's main character Gloria <a href="The%20Law%20of%20Non-Contradiction%23Comparisons%20to%20the%20work%20of%20the%20Coens">sits at the beach in shot and position similar to the picture's</a>. The episode's themes were also compared to "Barton Fink"'s.

The Coens are known for making films that defy simple classification. Although they refer to their first film, "<a href="Blood%20Simple">Blood Simple</a>" (1984), as a relatively straightforward example of <a href="detective%20fiction">detective fiction</a>, the Coens wrote their next script, "<a href="Raising%20Arizona">Raising Arizona</a>" (1987), without trying to fit a particular genre. They decided to write a <a href="comedy">comedy</a> but intentionally added dark elements to produce what Ethan calls "a pretty savage film". Their third film, "<a href="Miller%27s%20Crossing">Miller's Crossing</a>" (1990), reversed this order, mixing bits of comedy into a <a href="crime%20film">crime film</a>. Yet it also subverts single-genre identity by using conventions from <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>, <a href="Romance%20novel">love stories</a>, and <a href="political%20satire">political satire</a>.

This trend of mixing genres continued and intensified with "Barton Fink" (1991); the Coens insist the film "does not belong to any genre". Ethan has described it as "a <a href="Buddy%20film">buddy movie</a> for the '90s". It contains elements of comedy, <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>, and <a href="Horror%20film">horror</a>, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro referred to it as a <a href="Bildungsroman">coming of age story</a>, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a "<a href="K%C3%BCnstlerroman">Künstlerroman</a>", highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the film as "a retro-<a href="surrealism">surrealist</a> vision".

Because it crosses genres, fragments the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, "Barton Fink" is often considered an example of <a href="postmodernist%20film">postmodernist film</a>. In his book "Postmodern Hollywood", Booker says the film renders the past with an <a href="Impressionism">impressionist</a> technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is "typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material". In his analysis of the Coens' films, Palmer calls "Barton Fink" a "postmodern pastiche" which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to "<a href="The%20Hours%20%28film%29">The Hours</a>" (2002), a film about <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a> and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, add to our understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist <a href="Linda%20Hutcheon">Linda Hutcheon</a>: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films "does not deny the "existence" of the past; it does question whether we can ever "know" that past other than through its textualizing remains".

Certain elements in "Barton Fink" highlight the veneer of postmodernism: the writer is unable to resolve his <a href="Modernism">modernist</a> focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism. The Coens' cinematic style is another example; when Barton and Audrey begin making love, the camera pans away to the bathroom, then moves toward the sink and down its drain. Rowell calls this a "postmodern update" of the notorious sexually suggestive image of a train entering a tunnel, used by director <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> in his film "<a href="North%20by%20Northwest">North by Northwest</a>" (1959).

"Barton Fink" uses several stylistic conventions to accentuate the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes. For example, the opening credits roll over the Hotel Earle's wallpaper, as the camera moves downward. This motion is repeated many times in the film, especially pursuant to Barton's claim that his job is to "plumb the depths" while writing. His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this <a href="trope%20%28literature%29">trope</a>; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe (which he has presumably been polishing) suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements – combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence – create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that "the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted it to end with an apocalyptic feeling".

The style of "Barton Fink" is also evocative – and representative – of films of the 1930s and 1940s. As critic Michael Dunne points out: "Fink's heavy overcoat, his hat, his dark, drab suits come realistically out of the Thirties, but they come even more out of the films of the Thirties." The style of the Hotel Earle and atmosphere of various scenes also reflect the influence of pre-World War II filmmaking. Even Charlie's underwear matches that worn by his filmic hero <a href="Jack%20Oakie">Jack Oakie</a>. At the same time, camera techniques used by the Coens in "Barton Fink" represent a combination of the classic with the original. Careful tracking shots and extreme close-ups distinguish the film as a product of the late 20th century.

From the start, the film moves continuously between Barton's <a href="Point%20of%20view%20shot">subjective view</a> of the world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera pans down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.

The shifting point of view coincides with the film's subject matter: filmmaking. The film begins with the end of a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This <a href="metanarrative">metanarrative</a> approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton (who is mouthing the words spoken by actors offscreen), not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: "[T]hough we listen to one scene, we watch another. ... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist (his play) and the world outside it (what goes into creating a performance)".

The film also employs numerous <a href="foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> techniques. Signifying the probable contents of the package Charlie leaves with Barton, the word "head" appears 60 times in the original screenplay. In a grim nod to later events, Charlie describes his positive attitude toward his "job" of selling <a href="insurance">insurance</a>: "Fire, theft and casualty are not things that only happen to other people."

Much has been written about the symbolic meanings of "Barton Fink". Rowell proposes that it is "a figurative head swelling of ideas that all lead back to the artist". The proximity of the sex scene to Audrey's murder prompts Lyons to insist: "Sex in "Barton Fink" is death". Others have suggested that the second half of the film is an extended <a href="dream%20sequence">dream sequence</a>.

The Coens, however, have denied any intent to create a systematic unity from symbols in the film. "We never, ever go into our films with anything like that in mind", Joel said in a 1998 interview. "There's never anything approaching that kind of specific intellectual breakdown. It's always a bunch of instinctive things that feel right, for whatever reason". The Coens have noted their comfort with unresolved ambiguity. Ethan said in 1991: ""Barton Fink" does end up telling you what's going on to the extent that it's important to know ... What isn't crystal clear isn't intended to become crystal clear, and it's fine to leave it at that." Regarding fantasies and dream sequences, he said:

The <a href="Homoeroticism">homoerotic</a> overtones of Barton's relationship with Charlie are not unintentional. Although one detective demands to know if they had "some sick sex thing", their intimacy is presented as anything but deviant, and cloaked in conventions of mainstream sexuality. Charlie's first friendly overture toward his neighbor, for example, comes in the form of a standard <a href="pick-up%20line">pick-up line</a>: "I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink". The wrestling scene between Barton and Charlie is also cited as an example of homoerotic affection. "We consider that a sex scene", Joel Coen said in 2001.

Many of the sound effects in "Barton Fink" are laden with meaning. For example, Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York City; its sound is light and pleasant. By contrast, the eerie sustained bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly through the lobby, until Chet silences it. The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton's confused mental state and punctuate Charlie's claim that "I hear everything that goes on in this dump". The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton's move west, mixed as it is with the sound of an ocean wave crashing – an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter.
Another symbolic sound is the hum of a <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>. Although his producer insists that these parasites don't live in Los Angeles (since "mosquitos breed in swamps; this is a desert"), its distinctive sound is heard clearly as Barton watches a bug circle overhead in his hotel room. Later, he arrives at meetings with mosquito bites on his face. The insect also figures prominently into the revelation of Audrey's death; Barton slaps a mosquito feeding on her corpse and suddenly realizes she has been murdered. The high pitch of the mosquito's hum is echoed in the high strings used for the film's score. During filming, the Coens were contacted by an animal rights group who expressed concern about how mosquitoes would be treated.

The <a href="Film%20score">score</a> was composed by <a href="Carter%20Burwell">Carter Burwell</a>, who has worked with the Coens since their first film. Unlike earlier projects, however – the Irish folk tune used for "Miller's Crossing" and an American folk song as the basis for "Raising Arizona" – Burwell wrote the music for "Barton Fink" without a specific inspiration. The score was released in 1996 on a compact disc, combined with the score for the Coens' film "<a href="Fargo%20%28film%29">Fargo</a>" (1996).

Several songs used in the film are laden with meaning. At one point Mayhew stumbles away from Barton and Audrey, drunk. As he wanders, he hollers the folk song "<a href="Old%20Black%20Joe">Old Black Joe</a>" (1853). Composed by <a href="Stephen%20Foster">Stephen Foster</a>, it tells the tale of an elderly slave preparing to join his friends in "a better land". Mayhew's rendition of the song coincides with his condition as an oppressed employee of Capitol Pictures, and it foreshadows Barton's own situation at the film's end.

When he finishes writing his script, Barton celebrates by dancing at a <a href="United%20Service%20Organizations">United Service Organizations</a> (USO) show. The song used in this scene is a rendition of "Down South Camp Meeting", a <a href="swing%20music">swing</a> tune. Its lyrics (unheard in the film) state: "Git ready (Sing) / Here they come! The choir's all set". These lines echo the title of Barton's play, "Bare Ruined Choirs". As the celebration erupts into a melee, the intensity of the music increases, and the camera zooms into the cavernous hollow of a trumpet. This sequence mirrors the camera's zoom into a sink drain just before Audrey is murdered earlier in the film.

Inspiration for the film came from several sources, and it contains <a href="allusion">allusion</a>s to many different people and events. For example, the title of Barton's play, "Bare Ruined Choirs", comes from line four of <a href="Sonnet%2073">Sonnet 73</a> by <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>. The poem's focus on aging and death connects to the film's exploration of artistic difficulty.

Later, at one point in the picnic scene, as Mayhew wanders drunkenly away from Barton and Audrey, he calls out: "Silent upon a peak in Darien!" This is the last line from <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>'s sonnet "<a href="On%20First%20Looking%20into%20Chapman%27s%20Homer">On First Looking into Chapman's Homer</a>" (1816). The literary reference not only demonstrates the character's knowledge of classic texts, but the poem's reference to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> matches Mayhew's announcement that he will "jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll ... improvise".

Other academic allusions are presented elsewhere, often with extreme subtlety. For example, a brief shot of the title page in a Mayhew novel indicates the publishing house of "Swain and Pappas". This is likely a reference to Marshall Swain and <a href="George%20Pappas">George Pappas</a>, philosophers whose work is concerned with themes explored in the film, including the limitations of knowledge and nature of being. One critic notes that Barton's fixation on the stain across the ceiling of his hotel room matches the protagonist's behavior in <a href="Flannery%20O%27Connor">Flannery O'Connor</a>'s short story "The Enduring Chill". 

Critics have suggested that the film indirectly references the work of writers <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a> (through the use of "<a href="Divine%20Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>" imagery) and <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> (through the presence of <a href="Goethe%27s%20Faust">Faustian</a> bargains). Confounding bureaucratic structures and irrational characters, like those in the novels of <a href="Franz%20Kafka">Franz Kafka</a>, appear in the film, but the Coens insist the connection was not intended. "I have not read him since college", admitted Joel in 1991, "when I devoured works like "<a href="The%20Metamorphosis">The Metamorphosis</a>". Others have mentioned "<a href="The%20Castle%20%28novel%29">The Castle</a>" and "<a href="In%20the%20Penal%20Colony">In the Penal Colony</a>", but I've never read them."

The character of Barton Fink is loosely based on <a href="Clifford%20Odets">Clifford Odets</a>, a playwright from New York who in the 1930s joined the <a href="Group%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%29">Group Theatre</a>, a gathering of dramatists which included <a href="Harold%20Clurman">Harold Clurman</a>, <a href="Cheryl%20Crawford">Cheryl Crawford</a>, and <a href="Lee%20Strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a>. Their work emphasized social issues and employed <a href="Stanislavski%27s%20system">Stanislavski's system</a> of acting to recreate human experience as truthfully as possible. Several of Odets' plays were successfully performed on Broadway, including "<a href="Awake%20and%20Sing%21">Awake and Sing!</a>" and "<a href="Waiting%20for%20Lefty">Waiting for Lefty</a>" (both in 1935). When public tastes turned away from politically engaged theatre and toward the familial <a href="Realism%20%28theatre%29">realism</a> of <a href="Eugene%20O%27Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a>, Odets had difficulty producing successful work, so he moved to Hollywood and spent 20 years writing film scripts.
The Coens wrote with Odets in mind; they imagined Barton Fink as "a serious dramatist, honest, politically engaged, and rather naive". As Ethan said in 1991: "It seemed natural that he comes from Group Theater and the decade of the thirties." Like Odets, Barton believes that the theatre should celebrate the trials and triumphs of everyday people; like Barton, Odets was highly egotistical. In the film, a review of Barton's play "Bare Ruined Choirs" indicates that his characters face a "brute struggle for existence ... in the most squalid corners". This wording is similar to the comment of biographer Gerald Weales that Odets' characters "struggle for life amidst petty conditions". Lines of dialogue from Barton's work are reminiscent of Odets' play "Awake and Sing!". For example, one character declares: "I'm awake now, awake for the first time". Another says: "Take that ruined choir. Make it sing".

However, many important differences exist between the two men. Joel Coen said: "Both writers wrote the same kind of plays with proletarian heroes, but their personalities were quite different. Odets was much more of an extrovert; in fact he was quite sociable even in Hollywood, and this is not the case with Barton Fink!" Although he was frustrated by his declining popularity in New York, Odets was successful during his time in Hollywood. Several of his later plays were adapted – by him and others – into films. One of these, "<a href="The%20Big%20Knife">The Big Knife</a>" (1955), matches Barton's life much more than Odets'. In it, an actor becomes overwhelmed by the greed of a film studio which hires him and eventually commits suicide. Another similarity to Odets' work is Audrey's death, which mirrors a scene in "<a href="Deadline%20at%20Dawn">Deadline at Dawn</a>" (1946), a film noir written by Odets. In that film, a character awakens to find that the woman he bedded the night before has been inexplicably murdered.

Odets chronicled his difficult transition from Broadway to Hollywood in his diary, published as "The Time Is Ripe: The 1940 Journal of Clifford Odets" (1988). The diary explored Odets' philosophical deliberations about writing and romance. He often invited women into his apartment, and he describes many of his affairs in the diary. These experiences, like the extended speeches about writing, are echoed in "Barton Fink" when Audrey visits and seduces Barton at the Hotel Earle. Turturro was the only member of the production who read Odets' "Journal", however, and the Coen brothers urge audiences to "take account of the difference between the character and the man".

Some similarities exist between the character of W.P. Mayhew and novelist <a href="William%20Faulkner">William Faulkner</a>. Like Mayhew, Faulkner became known as a preeminent writer of <a href="Southern%20Renaissance">Southern literature</a> and later worked in the film business. Like Faulkner, Mayhew is a heavy drinker and speaks contemptuously about Hollywood. Faulkner's name appeared in the Hollywood 1940s history book "City of Nets", which the Coens read while creating "Barton Fink". Ethan explained in 1998: "I read this story in passing that Faulkner was assigned to write a wrestling picture... That was part of what got us going on the whole "Barton Fink" thing." Faulkner worked on a wrestling film called "<a href="Flesh%20%281932%20film%29">Flesh</a>" (1932), which starred <a href="Wallace%20Beery">Wallace Beery</a>, the actor for whom Barton is writing. The focus on wrestling was fortuitous for the Coens, as they participated in the sport in high school.

However, the Coens disavow a significant connection between Faulkner and Mayhew, calling the similarities "superficial". "As far as the details of the character are concerned," Ethan said in 1991, "Mayhew is very different from Faulkner, whose experiences in Hollywood were not the same at all." Unlike Mayhew's inability to write due to drink and personal problems, Faulkner continued to pen novels after working in the film business, winning several awards for fiction completed during and after his time in Hollywood.

Lerner's <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>-nominated character of studio mogul Jack Lipnick is a composite of several Hollywood producers, including <a href="Harry%20Cohn">Harry Cohn</a>, <a href="Louis%20B.%20Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a>, and <a href="Jack%20L.%20Warner">Jack L. Warner</a> – three of the most powerful men in the film industry at the time in which "Barton Fink" is set. Like Mayer, Lipnick is originally from the <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>ian capital city <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>. When World War II broke out, Warner pressed for a position in the military and ordered his wardrobe department to create a military uniform for him; Lipnick does the same in his final scene. Warner once referred to writers as "schmucks with Underwoods", leading to Barton's use in the film of an <a href="Underwood%20Typewriter%20Company">Underwood</a> typewriter.

At the same time, the Coens stress that the labyrinth of deception and difficulty Barton endures is not based on their own experience. Although Joel has said that artists tend to "meet up with <a href="Philistinism">Philistines</a>", he added: ""Barton Fink" is quite far from our own experience. Our professional life in Hollywood has been especially easy, and this is no doubt extraordinary and unfair". Ethan has suggested that Lipnick – like the men on which he is based – is in some ways a product of his time. "I don't know that that kind of character exists anymore. Hollywood is a little more bland and corporate than that now".

The Coens have acknowledged several cinematic inspirations for "Barton Fink". Chief among these are three films by Polish-French filmmaker <a href="Roman%20Polanski">Roman Polanski</a>: "<a href="Repulsion%20%28film%29">Repulsion</a>" (1965), "<a href="Cul-de-sac%20%281966%20film%29">Cul-de-Sac</a>" (1966), and "<a href="The%20Tenant">The Tenant</a>" (1976). These films employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently compared to that of Trelkovsky in his apartment in "The Tenant". Ethan said regarding the genre of "Barton Fink": "[I]t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else." By coincidence, Polanski was the head of the jury at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> in 1991, where "Barton Fink" premiered. This created an awkward situation. "Obviously", Joel Coen said later, "we have been influenced by his films, but at this time we were very hesitant to speak to him about it because we did not want to give the impression we were sucking up".

Other works cited as influences for "Barton Fink" include the film "<a href="The%20Shining%20%28film%29">The Shining</a>" (1980), produced and directed by <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>, and the comedy "<a href="Sullivan%27s%20Travels">Sullivan's Travels</a>" (1941), written and directed by <a href="Preston%20Sturges">Preston Sturges</a>. Set in an empty hotel, Kubrick's film concerns a writer unable to proceed with his latest work. Although the Coens approve of comparisons to "The Shining", Joel suggests that Kubrick's film "belongs in a more global sense to the horror film genre". "Sullivan's Travels", released the year in which "Barton Fink" is set, follows successful director John Sullivan, who decides to create a film of deep social import – not unlike Barton's desire to create entertainment for "the common man". Sullivan eventually decides that comedic entertainment is a key role for filmmakers, similar to Jack Lipnick's assertion at the end of "Barton Fink" that "the audience wants to see action, adventure".

Additional allusions to films and film history abound in "Barton Fink". At one point a character discusses "Victor Soderberg"; the name is a reference to <a href="Victor%20Sj%C3%B6str%C3%B6m">Victor Sjöström</a>, a Swedish director who worked in Hollywood under the name Victor Seastrom. Charlie's line about how his troubles "don't amount to a hill of beans" is a probable homage to the film "<a href="Casablanca%20%28film%29">Casablanca</a>" (1942). Another similarity is that of "Barton Fink"'s beach scene to the final moment in "<a href="La%20Dolce%20Vita">La Dolce Vita</a>" (1960), wherein a young woman's final line of dialogue is obliterated by the noise of the ocean. The unsettling emptiness of the Hotel Earle has also been compared to the living spaces in "<a href="Key%20Largo%20%28film%29">Key Largo</a>" (1948) and "<a href="Sunset%20Boulevard%20%28film%29">Sunset Boulevard</a>" (1950).

Two of the film's central themes – the culture of entertainment production and the writing process – are intertwined and relate specifically to the self-referential nature of the work (as well as the work within the work). It is a film about a man who writes a film based on a play, and at the centre of Barton's entire opus is Barton himself. The dialogue in his play "Bare Ruined Choirs" (also the first lines of the film, some of which are repeated at the end of the film as lines in Barton's screenplay "The Burlyman") give us a glimpse into Barton's self-descriptive art. The mother in the play is named "Lil", which is later revealed to be the name of Barton's own mother. In the play, "The Kid" (a representation of Barton himself) refers to his home "six flights up" – the same floor where Barton resides at the Hotel Earle. Moreover, the characters' writing processes in "Barton Fink" reflect important differences between the culture of entertainment production in New York's Broadway district and Hollywood.

Although Barton speaks frequently about his desire to help create "a new, living theater, of and about and for the common man", he does not recognize that such a theater has already been created: the films. In fact, he disdains this authentically popular form. On the other hand, the world of Broadway theatre in "Barton Fink" is a place of <a href="high%20culture">high culture</a>, where the creator believes most fully that his work embodies his own values. Although he pretends to disdain his own success, Barton believes he has achieved a great victory with "Bare Ruined Choirs". He seeks praise; when his agent Garland asks if he has seen the glowing review in the "Herald", Barton says "No", even though his producer had just read it to him. Barton feels close to the theatre, confident that it can help him create work that honors "the common man". The men and women who funded the production – "those people", as Barton calls them – demonstrate that Broadway is just as concerned with profit as Hollywood; but its intimacy and smaller scale allow the author to feel that his work has real value.
Barton does not believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles is a world of false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the screenplay (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he is staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast of the United States</a>. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let "you" run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run "this" particular asylum".

Deception in "Barton Fink" is emblematic of Hollywood's focus on <a href="low%20culture">low culture</a>, its relentless desire to efficiently produce formulaic entertainment for the sole purpose of economic gain. Capitol Pictures assigns Barton to write <a href="Flesh%20%281932%20film%29">a wrestling picture with superstar Wallace Beery in the leading role</a>. Although Lipnick declares otherwise, Geisler assures Barton that "it's just a <a href="B%20movie">B picture</a>". Audrey tries to help the struggling writer by telling him: "Look, it's really just a formula. You don't have to type your soul into it". This formula is made clear by Lipnick, who asks Barton in their first meeting whether the main character should have a love interest or take care of an orphaned child. Barton shows his <a href="iconoclasm">iconoclasm</a> by answering: "Both, maybe?" In the end, his inability to conform to the studio's norms destroys Barton.

A similar depiction of Hollywood appears in <a href="Nathanael%20West">Nathanael West</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Day%20of%20the%20Locust">The Day of the Locust</a>" (1939), which many critics see as an important precursor to "Barton Fink". Set in a run-down apartment complex, the book describes a painter reduced to decorating film sets. It portrays Hollywood as crass and exploitative, devouring talented individuals in its neverending quest for profit. In both West's novel and "Barton Fink", protagonists suffer under the oppressive industrial machine of the film studio.

The film contains further self-referential material, as a film about a writer having difficulty writing (written by the Coen brothers while they were having difficulty writing "Miller's Crossing"). Barton is trapped between his own desire to create meaningful art and Capitol Pictures' need to use its standard conventions to earn profits. Audrey's advice about following the formula would have saved Barton, but he does not heed it. However, when he puts the mysterious package on his writing desk (which might have contained her head), she might have been helping him posthumously, in other ways. The film itself toys with standard screenplay formulas. As with Mayhew's scripts, "Barton Fink" contains a "good wrestler" (Barton, it seems) and a "bad wrestler" (Charlie) who "confront" each other at the end. But in typical Coen fashion, the lines of good and evil are blurred, and the supposed hero in fact reveals himself to be deaf to the pleadings of his "common man" neighbor. By blurring the lines between reality and surreal experience, the film subverts the "simple morality tales" and "road maps" offered to Barton as easy paths for the writer to follow.

However, the filmmakers point out that "Barton Fink" is not meant to represent the Coens themselves. "Our life in Hollywood has been particularly easy", they once said. "The film isn't a personal comment". Still, universal themes of the creative process are explored throughout the film. During the picnic scene, for example, Mayhew asks Barton: "Ain't writin' peace?" Barton pauses, then says: "No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain." Such exchanges led critic William Rodney Allen to call "Barton Fink" "an autobiography of the life of the Coens' minds, not of literal fact". Allen's comment is itself a reference to the phrase "life of the mind", used repeatedly in the film in wildly differing contexts.

Several of the film's elements, including the setting at the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, have led some critics to highlight parallels to the rise of <a href="fascism">fascism</a> at the time. For example, the detectives who visit Barton at the Hotel Earle are named "Mastrionatti" and "Deutsch" – Italian and German names, evocative of the regimes of <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> and <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. Their contempt for Barton is clear: "Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't it? ... I didn't think this dump was restricted." Later, just before killing his last victim, Charlie says: "<a href="Heil%20Hitler">Heil Hitler</a>". Jack Lipnick hails originally from the <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>ian capital city <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>, which was occupied from 1941 by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, following <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a>.

"[I]t's not forcing the issue to suggest that <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> hovers over "Barton Fink"", writes biographer Ronald Bergan. Others see a more specific message in the film, particularly Barton's obliviousness to Charlie's homicidal tendencies. Critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> wrote in his 1991 review that the Coens intended to create an allegory for the rise of <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>. "They paint Fink as an ineffectual and impotent left-wing intellectual, who sells out while telling himself he is doing the right thing, who thinks he understands the 'common man' but does not understand that, for many common men, fascism had a seductive appeal". However, he goes on to say: "It would be a mistake to insist too much on this aspect of the movie..."

Other critics are more demanding. M. Keith Booker writes: For their part, the Coens deny any intention of presenting an <a href="Allegory">allegorical</a> message. They chose the detectives' names deliberately, but "we just wanted them to be representative of the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis world powers</a> at the time. It just seemed kind of amusing. It's a tease. All that stuff with Charlie – the "Heil Hitler!" business – sure, it's all there, but it's kind of a tease." In 2001, Joel responded to a question about critics who provide extended comprehensive analysis: "That's how they've been trained to watch movies. In "Barton Fink", we may have encouraged it – like teasing animals at the zoo. The movie is intentionally ambiguous in ways they may not be used to seeing".

Although subdued in dialogue and imagery, the theme of <a href="slavery">slavery</a> appears several times in the film. Mayhew's crooning of the <a href="parlor%20song">parlor song</a> "Old Black Joe" depicts him as enslaved to the film studio, not unlike the song's narrator who pines for "my friends from the cotton fields away". One brief shot of the door to Mayhew's workspace shows the title of the film he is supposedly writing: "Slave Ship". This is a reference to <a href="Slave%20Ship%20%281937%20film%29">a 1937 movie</a> written by Mayhew's inspiration William Faulkner and starring Wallace Beery, for whom Barton is composing a script in the film.

The symbol of the slave ship is furthered by specific set designs, including the round window in Ben Geisler's office which resembles a <a href="porthole">porthole</a>, as well as the walkway leading to Mayhew's bungalow, which resembles the boarding ramp of a watercraft. Several lines of dialogue make clear by the film's end that Barton has become a slave to the studio: "[T]he contents of your head", Lipnick's assistant tells him, "are the property of Capitol Pictures". After Barton turns in his script, Lipnick delivers an even more brutal punishment: "Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write". This contempt and control is representative of the opinions expressed by many writers in Hollywood at the time. As <a href="Arthur%20Miller">Arthur Miller</a> said in his review of "Barton Fink": "The only thing about Hollywood that I am sure of is that its mastication of writers can never be too wildly exaggerated".

During the first third of the film, Barton speaks constantly of his desire to write work which centers on and appeals to "the common man". In one speech he declares: "The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it "new" theater, Charlie; call it "real" theater. Call it "our" theater." Yet, despite his rhetoric, Barton is totally unable (or unwilling) to appreciate the humanity of the "common man" living next door to him. Later in the film, Charlie explains that he has brought various horrors upon him because "you "don't listen"!" In his first conversation with Charlie, Barton constantly interrupts Charlie just as he is saying "I could tell you some stories-", demonstrating that despite his fine words he really is not interested in Charlie's experiences; in another scene, Barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to the world by stuffing his ears with cotton to block the sound of his ringing telephone.

Barton's position as screenwriter is of particular consequence to his relationship with "the common man". By refusing to listen to his neighbor, Barton cannot validate Charlie's existence in his writing – with disastrous results. Not only is Charlie stuck in a job which demeans him, but he cannot (at least in Barton's case) have his story told. More centrally, the film traces the evolution of Barton's understanding of "the common man": At first he is an abstraction to be lauded from a vague distance. Then he becomes a complex individual with fears and desires. Finally he shows himself to be a powerful individual in his own right, capable of extreme forms of destruction and therefore feared and/or respected.

The complexity of "the common man" is also explored through the oft-mentioned "life of the mind". While expounding on his duty as a writer, Barton drones: "I gotta tell you, the life of the mind ... There's no road map for that territory ... and exploring it can be painful. The kind of pain most people don't know anything about." Barton assumes that he is privy to thoughtful creative considerations while Charlie is not. This delusion shares the film's climax, as Charlie runs through the hallway of the Earle, shooting the detectives with a shotgun and screaming: ""Look upon me! I'll show you the life of the mind!!"" Charlie's "life of the mind" is no less complex than Barton's; in fact, some critics consider it more so.

Charlie's understanding of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he asks Barton about "the two lovebirds next door", despite the fact that they are several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: "Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'." His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: "Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try to help them out."

Themes of religious salvation and allusions to the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> appear only briefly in "Barton Fink", but their presence pervades the story. While Barton is experiencing his most desperate moment of confusion and despair, he opens the drawer of his desk and finds a <a href="Gideons%20International">Gideon Bible</a>. He opens it "randomly" to , and reads from it: "And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill." This passage reflects Barton's inability to make sense of his own experiences (wherein Audrey has been "cut in pieces"), as well as the "hopes and dreams" of "the common man". "<a href="Nebuchadnezzar%20II">Nebuchadnezzar</a>" is also the title of a novel that Mayhew gives to Barton as a "little entertainment" to "divert you in your sojourn among the Philistines".

Mayhew alludes to "the story of Solomon's mammy", a reference to <a href="Bathsheba">Bathsheba</a>, who gave birth to <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a> after her lover <a href="David">David</a> had her husband <a href="Uriah%20the%20Hittite">Uriah</a> killed. Although Audrey cuts Mayhew off by praising his book (which Audrey herself may have written), the reference foreshadows the love triangle which evolves among the three characters of "Barton Fink". Rowell points out that Mayhew is murdered (presumably by Charlie) soon after Barton and Audrey have sex. Another Biblical reference comes when Barton flips to the front of the Bible in his desk drawer and sees his own words transposed into the <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>. This is seen as a representation of his <a href="hubris">hubris</a> as a self-conceived omnipotent master of creation, or alternatively, as a playful juxtaposition demonstrating Barton's hallucinatory state of mind.

"Barton Fink" premiered in May 1991 at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. Beating competition which included <a href="Jacques%20Rivette">Jacques Rivette</a>'s "<a href="La%20Belle%20Noiseuse">La Belle Noiseuse</a>", <a href="Spike%20Lee">Spike Lee</a>'s "<a href="Jungle%20Fever">Jungle Fever</a>", and <a href="David%20Mamet">David Mamet</a>'s "<a href="Homicide%20%281991%20film%29">Homicide</a>", the Coen brothers' film won three awards: Best Director, Best Actor, and the top prize "<a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a>". This sweep of awards in major categories at Cannes was extremely rare, and some critics felt the jury was too generous to the exclusion of other worthy entries. Worried that the triple victory could set a precedent which would undervalue other films, Cannes decided after the 1991 festival to limit each movie to a maximum of two awards.

"Barton Fink" was also nominated for three <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>: Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Lerner), Best Art Direction (<a href="Dennis%20Gassner">Dennis Gassner</a>, <a href="Nancy%20Haigh">Nancy Haigh</a>), and Best Costume Design (Richard Hornung). Lerner lost to <a href="Jack%20Palance">Jack Palance</a> for the latter's role in "<a href="City%20Slickers">City Slickers</a>"; the awards for Art Direction (Gassner and Haigh won by beating themselves) and Costume Design went to "<a href="Bugsy">Bugsy</a>".

The film was also nominated for the prestigious <a href="Grand%20Prix%20%28Belgian%20Syndicate%20of%20Cinema%20Critics%29">Grand Prix</a> of the <a href="Belgian%20Syndicate%20of%20Cinema%20Critics">Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics</a>.

"Barton Fink" received positive reviews from critics. On <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film has a 90% "Certified Fresh" rating, based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "Twisty and unsettling, the Coen brothers' satirical tale of a 1940s playwright struggling with writer's block is packed with their trademark sense of humor and terrific performances from its cast." On <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, the film has a score of 69 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".

"<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" critic Rita Kempley described "Barton Fink" as "certainly one of the year's best and most intriguing films". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" critic <a href="Vincent%20Canby">Vincent Canby</a> called it "an unqualified winner" and "a fine dark comedy of flamboyant style and immense though seemingly effortless technique". Critic Jim Emerson called "Barton Fink" "the Coen brothers' most deliciously, provocatively indescribable picture yet".

Some critics disliked the abstruse plot and deliberately enigmatic ending. "<a href="Chicago%20Reader">Chicago Reader</a>" critic <a href="Jonathan%20Rosenbaum">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a> warned of the Coens' "adolescent smarminess and comic-book cynicism", and described "Barton Fink" as "a midnight-movie gross-out in Sunday-afternoon art-house clothing".

In a 1994 interview, Joel dismissed criticism of unclear elements in their films: "People have a problem dealing with the fact that our movies are not straight-ahead. They would prefer that the last half of "Barton Fink" just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world". Talk show host <a href="Larry%20King">Larry King</a> expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>": "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked." In a 2016 interview, screenwriter <a href="Charlie%20Kaufman">Charlie Kaufman</a> said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, "A movie I really love is "Barton Fink". I don't know if that’s the movie I'd take to a desert island, but I feel like there's so much in there, you could watch it again and again. That's important to me, especially if that was the only movie I'd have with me for the rest of my life."

"Barton Fink" was ranked by Greg Cwik of <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a> as the Coens' fifth best film. It was voted the 11th best film of the 1990s in a poll of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" contributors, and was described as "one of [the Coens'] most profound, and painful" works.

The film opened in the United States on eleven screens on August 23, 1991, and earned $268,561 during its opening weekend. During its theatrical release, "Barton Fink" grossed $6,153,939 in the United States. That the film failed to recoup the expenses of production amused film producer <a href="Joel%20Silver">Joel Silver</a>, with whom the Coens would later work in "<a href="The%20Hudsucker%20Proxy">The Hudsucker Proxy</a>" (1994): "I don't think it made $5 million, and it cost $9 million to make. [The Coen brothers have] a reputation for being weird, off-center, inaccessible."

The film was released in VHS home video format on March 5, 1992, and a DVD edition was made available on May 20, 2003. The DVD contains a gallery of still photos, theatrical trailers, and eight deleted scenes. The film is also available on <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a>, in the UK, in a region-free format that will work in any Blu-ray player.

The Coen brothers have expressed interest in making a <a href="sequel">sequel</a> to "Barton Fink" called "Old Fink", which would take place in the 1960s. "It's the <a href="summer%20of%20love">summer of love</a> and [Fink is] teaching at <a href="U.C.%20Berkeley">Berkeley</a>. He ratted on a lot of his friends to the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>", said Joel Coen. The brothers have stated that they have had talks with John Turturro about reprising his role as Fink, but they were waiting "until he was actually old enough to play the part".

Speaking to "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" in June 2011, Turturro suggested the sequel would be set in the 1970s, and Fink would be a <a href="hippie">hippie</a> with a large <a href="Jewfro">Jewfro</a>. He said "you'll have to wait another 10 years for that, at least".

Pigeon guillemot

The pigeon guillemot ("Cepphus columba") is a species of bird in the <a href="auk">auk</a> family, <a href="Alcidae">Alcidae</a>. One of three species in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Cepphus">Cepphus</a>", it is most closely related to the <a href="spectacled%20guillemot">spectacled guillemot</a>. There are five subspecies of the pigeon guillemot; all subspecies, when in , are dark brown with a black iridescent sheen, with a distinctive wing patch broken by a brown-black wedge. Its has a mottled grey and black and white . The long bill is black, as are the claws. The legs, feet, and inside of the mouth are red. It closely resembles the <a href="black%20guillemot">black guillemot</a>, which is slightly smaller and lacks the dark wing wedge present in the pigeon guillemot. Combined, the two form a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a>.

This <a href="seabird">seabird</a> is found on North Pacific coastal waters, from <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> through <a href="California">California</a> to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>. The pigeon guillemot breeds and sometimes roosts on rocky shores, cliffs, and islands close to shallow water. In the winter, some birds move slightly south in the northern-most part of their range in response to advancing ice and <a href="bird%20migration">migrate</a> slightly north in the southern part of their range, generally preferring more sheltered areas.

This species feeds on small fish and marine invertebrates, mostly near the sea floor, that it catches by pursuit diving. Pigeon guillemots are <a href="social%20monogamy">monogamous</a> breeders, nesting in small colonies close to the shore. They defend small territories around a nesting cavity, in which they lay one or two eggs. Both parents <a href="avian%20incubation">incubate</a> the eggs and feed the chicks. After leaving the nest the young bird is completely independent of its parents. Several birds and other animals prey on the eggs and chicks.

The pigeon guillemot is considered to be a <a href="least%20concern%20species">least concern species</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. This is due to its large, stable population and wide range. Threats to this bird include climate change, introduced mammalian predators, and oil spills.

The pigeon guillemot is one of three species of auk in the genus "<a href="Cepphus">Cepphus</a>", the other two being the <a href="black%20guillemot">black guillemot</a> of the Atlantic Ocean and the <a href="spectacled%20guillemot">spectacled guillemot</a> from the Eastern Pacific. It was described in 1811 by <a href="Peter%20Simon%20Pallas">Peter Simon Pallas</a> in the second volume of his "Zoographia Rosso-Asiatica". A 1996 study looking at the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> of the auk family found that the genus "Cepphus" is most closely related to the murrelets from the genus "<a href="Synthliboramphus">Synthliboramphus</a>". An alternative arrangement, proposed in 2001 using <a href="Molecular%20genetics">genetic</a> and <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> comparisons, found them as a <a href="Sister%20group">sister clade</a> to the <a href="murre">murre</a>s, <a href="razorbill">razorbill</a>, <a href="little%20auk">little auk</a> and <a href="great%20auk">great auk</a>. Within the genus, the pigeon guillemot and spectacled guillemot are sister species, and the black guillemot is <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> within the genus. The pigeon guillemot and the black guillemot form a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a>.

There are five recognised <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the pigeon guillemot:


In the binomial name, the genus, "Cepphus", is derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "kepphos", referring to an unknown pale waterbird mentioned by <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> among other classical writers, later variously identified as types of seabirds, including gulls, auks and gannets. The specific epithet, "columba", is derived both from the Icelandic "klumba", meaning "auk", and the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "columba", meaning "pigeon". Pallas noted in his description of this species that the common name for the related black guillemot was Greenland dove. "Snowi" is dedicated to Captain Henry James Snow, a British seaman and hunter. The name of the subspecies "kaiurka" is derived from the <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a> "kachurka", meaning "petrel". "Adiantus" is derived from the Greek "adiantos", "unwetted". The trinomial epithet of the subspecies "C. c. eureka" is from the motto of the state of California, which is derived from the Greek "<a href="Eureka%20%28word%29">heurēka</a>", meaning "I have found it".

The pigeon guillemot is a medium-sized auk, in length and weighing . Both sexes are alike in appearance and mass, except for Californian birds where females were found to have larger bills than males. The summer or of the adult is mostly dark brown with a black sheen, with a white wing patch broken by a brown-black wedge. In winter, the are iridescent black, often with black fringes giving a scalloped appearance, and the and rump are white. The forehead, , , eye line and ear coverts are black with white tips, sometimes the tips are narrow and the head looks black. In all plumages, the are plain and dark. Adults <a href="Moulting">moult</a> into their winter or between August and October, taking around a month to complete and leaving the bird unable to fly for around four weeks. Birds moult into their breeding plumage between January and March. The legs and feet are red, with black claws. The iris is brown and the eye is surrounded by a thin unbroken white <a href="eye-ring">eye-ring</a>. The bill is long and black and the inside of the mouth is red.
The juvenile pigeon guillemot resembles a winter adult but has underpart feathers tipped in brown, giving the appearance of barring, more brown feathers in the upperparts and its wing patch is smaller. Its legs are a grey-brown in color. It loses the brown underpart feathers after its first moult two to three months after fledging. Its moult to its first summer plumage is later than adults, happening between March and May, and first summer birds lack the glossy sheen of adults.

The differences between the subspecies are based on body measurements such as the and wing length. These are larger in southern subspecies and smaller further north. The amount of white on the outer and increases in northern subspecies, except for "Cepphus columba snowi", where the white is reduced or entirely absent.

The pigeon guillemot walks well and habitually has an upright posture. When sitting it frequently rests on its <a href="Tarsometatarsus">tarsi</a>. The wings of the pigeon guillemot are shorter and rounder than other auks, reflecting greater adaptation towards diving than flying. It has difficulty taking off in calm conditions without a runway, but once in the air it is faster than the black guillemot, having been recorded at , about faster than the black guillemot. In the water it is a strong swimmer on the surface using its feet. When diving, propulsion is provided both by the wings, which beat at a rate of 2.1/s, but unusually for auks also by the feet. Pigeon guillemots have been recorded travelling horizontally on dives.

The pigeon guillemot is similar to the related black guillemot, but can be distinguished by its larger size, and in the breeding season by its dusky-grey underwing and the dark brown wedge on the white wing patch.

The pigeon guillemot ranges across the Northern <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>, from the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a> and the <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka Peninsula</a> in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> to coasts in western <a href="North%20America">North America</a> from Alaska to California. This bird's wintering range is more restricted than its breeding season range, the pigeon guillemot usually wintering at sea or on the coasts, from the <a href="Pribilof%20Islands">Pribilof</a> and <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> to <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> and southern California. In Alaska, some <a href="Bird%20migration">migrate</a> south because of advancing sea-ice, although others remain in <a href="Lead%20%28sea%20ice%29">ice leads</a> or ice holes some distance from the edge of the ice sheet. Further south, birds <a href="bird%20ringing">banded</a> in the <a href="Farallon%20Islands">Farallon Islands</a> in central California have been recorded moving north, as far as Oregon and even British Columbia. It generally is <a href="Philopatry">philopatric</a>, meaning it returns to the colony where it hatched to breed, but it sometimes moves long distances after fledging before settling, for example a chick ringed in the Farallones was recorded breeding in British Columbia.

This bird's breeding habitats are rocky shores, cliffs, and islands close to shallow water less than deep. It is flexible about its breeding site location, the important factor being protection from predators, and it is more commonly found breeding on offshore islands than coastal sea cliffs. In the winter it forages along rocky coasts, often in sheltered coves. Sandy-bottomed water is avoided, presumably because this does not provide the right habitat to feed in. It occasionally can be found further offshore, as far as the continental shelf break. In the Bering Sea and Alaska, it feeds in openings in ice sheets.

Pigeon guillemots are generally diurnal, but have been recorded feeding before dawn and after sunset. They typically sleep in loose groups in sheltered waters or on shore close to water. They typically rest spaced apart, but mated pairs rest close together. Bathing and <a href="preening%20%28bird%29">preening</a> can also happen on shore or at sea.

The pigeon guillemot usually lays its eggs in rocky cavities near water, but it often nests in any available cavity, including caves, disused burrows of other seabirds, and even old bomb casings. It is noted that pigeon guillemots do not inhabit nests with <a href="gull">gull</a> eggs, specifically those of the <a href="western%20gull">western gull</a>. This guillemot usually retains its nest site, meaning that nest sites are generally used multiple times, although it does not display this behaviour if its mate does not return to breed. The nests are found at a wide range of heights, from about above sea-level. Nesting sites are defended by established pairs, as is a small territory around the nest entrance of between . Both sexes defend the nesting site, although most defence is done by the male.

Foreign eggs in this guillemot's nest are generally removed. Nest competition with <a href="Cassin%27s%20auklet">Cassin's auklet</a> is occasional, the pigeon guillemot almost always just removing the eggs, and rarely <a href="pithing">pithing</a> before removal. On the other hand larger auk species, <a href="tufted%20puffin">tufted puffin</a>s and <a href="rhinoceros%20auklet">rhinoceros auklet</a>s, have been reported evicting pigeon guillemots from their nesting crevices.

This guillemot nests at a variety of densities, ranging from a single individual to dense colonies. The nesting density is generally not affected by predation, although on a very local scale, nesting closer to neighbors has a slight advantage. Colonies are attended during the day and, except for birds incubating or brooding, adults do not remain in the colony at night. Birds usually arrive in the colony in the morning, with counts decreasing after early afternoon, when high tide is. Colony attendance is affected by the tide, more appearing when the <a href="tide">tide</a> is higher and less when the tide is lower, probably because the prey this bird feeds on is more accessible during low tide, thus more birds are away from the colony. The counts vary the most before laying, while they are relatively stable during incubation and egg laying.

Pigeon guillemots form long-term pair bonds, the pairs usually reuniting each year, although occasionally pairs divorce. The formation of the pair bond is poorly understood. It is thought that form of play known as "water games", which involves chasing of birds on and under the water at sea, and duet-trilling may have a function in maintaining the pair bond or act as a prelude to copulation. The red colour of the mouth may also be a sexual signal.

Usually arriving at its breeding range 40 to 50 days before laying starts, the pigeon guillemot breeds from late April to September. During this time, it generally lays a <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of one or two eggs. The eggs have grey and brown blotches near the larger end of the egg and range in colour from creamy to pale blue-green. They measure on average, but become longer when laid later in the breeding season. Incubated by both sexes, the eggs usually hatch after 26 to 32 days. The chick is continuously by both parents for three days, and then at intervals for another two to four days, after which it is able to control its own body temperature. Both parents are responsible for feeding the chicks, and bring single fish held in the bill throughout the day, but most frequently in the morning.
The chicks usually <a href="fledge">fledge</a> 34 to 42 days after hatching, although the time taken to fledge has been known to take anywhere from 29 to 54 days. Chicks fledge by leaving the colony and flying to sea, after which they are independent of their parents and receive no post-fledging care. After this, the adult also leaves the colony. Young birds do not breed until at least three years after fledging, with most first breeding at four years of age. While they may not return to breed, two or three year old birds may start attending the breeding colony before they reach sexual maturity, arriving in the colony after the breeding birds. Pigeon guillemots that reach adulthood have an average life-expectancy of 4.5 years, and the oldest recorded individual lived for 14 years.

The pigeon guillemot is a very vocal bird, particularly during the breeding season, and makes several <a href="bird%20vocalisation">calls</a>, some of which are paired with displays, to communicate with others of its kind. One such display call pairing is the conspicuous hunch-whistle, where the tail is slightly raised, the wings held slightly out and the head thrown back 45-90° while whistling, before snapping back to horizontal. The function of this call is to advertise ownership of a territory. Another call, the trill, denotes ownership over larger distances. Trills can be performed singly or as duets between pairs; if performed as a duet then the call also functions to help reinforce pair bond. Trills are usually given from a resting position, except for the trill-waggle, which has the bird raising its tail, opening its wings and ruffling the feathers of its neck and head, followed by a waggling of its outstretched neck and head. This display is antagonistic in a context where pigeon guillemots are in a group and often is the precursor to an attack. Low whistles are made by unpaired males attempting to attract a mate, and are deeper than hunch-whistles and involve less movement of the head. Other calls made include seeps and cheeps made between mates and screams made in the presence of predators.

The pigeon guillemot forages by itself or in small groups, diving underwater for food, usually close to shore and during the breeding season within of the colony. It forages at depths from , but it prefers depths between . The dives can range from 10 to 144 seconds, and usually average 87 seconds, with an intermission between dives lasting around 98 seconds. Dives of two to ten seconds are typical when feeding on shoals of sandlance at the water's surface. Smaller prey are probably consumed underwater, but larger organisms are brought to the surface to eat after capture.

The pigeon guillemot mostly feeds on <a href="benthic">benthic</a> prey found at the lowest level in a body of water close to the sea floor, but it also takes some prey from higher in the <a href="water%20column">water column</a>. It mainly eats fish and other aquatic animals. Fish taken include <a href="sculpin">sculpin</a>s, <a href="Trichodon%20trichodon">sandfish</a>, <a href="cod">cod</a>, and <a href="capelin">capelin</a>; <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s include shrimp and crabs like the <a href="Glebocarcinus%20oregonensis">pygmy rock crab</a>, and even rarely <a href="polychaete">polychaete</a> worms, gastropods, bivalves and squid. The diet varies greatly, based on where the individual bird is, the season, and also from year to year, as ocean conditions change prey availability. For example, invertebrates are more commonly taken in winter. The foraging method used by this species differs from that of auks in other genera. It hangs upside down above the seafloor, probing with its head for prey and using its feet and wings to maintain position. The chick's diet varies slightly, with more fish than invertebrates, particularly rockfish (family <a href="Sebastidae">Sebastidae</a>). Specialization in the prey taken by a pigeon guillemot when foraging for its chicks generally results in greater reproductive success, with a high-lipid diet allowing for more growth.

The adult pigeon guillemot requires about 20% of its own weight, or of food each day. It doubles its rate of fishing when feeding the nestlings. As the nestlings get older, they are fed more, until 11 days after hatching, when the food generally levels out. The food they get, although, starts to decrease about 30 days after hatching.

Avian predation is the most common cause of egg loss in the pigeon guillemot. Species that prey on the nests include the <a href="northwestern%20crow">northwestern crow</a>, a common predator of both eggs and chicks, as well as <a href="glaucous-winged%20gull">glaucous-winged gull</a>s, stoats and <a href="garter%20snake">garter snake</a>s. <a href="Raccoon">Raccoon</a>s are also common predators, preying on eggs, chicks, and adults. Adults are sometimes hunted by <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>s, <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>s, <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a>s and <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>s. In the water, they have been reported to be taken by <a href="orca">orca</a> and <a href="giant%20Pacific%20octopus">giant Pacific octopus</a>es.

This bird, especially its chicks, is vulnerable to "<a href="Aspergillus%20fumigatus">Aspergillus fumigatus</a>", a fungal disease, while in captivity. It is also vulnerable to the <a href="cestode">cestode</a> "<a href="Alcataenia%20campylacantha">Alcataenia campylacantha</a>". Ticks ("<a href="Ixodes%20uriae">Ixodes uriae</a>") and fleas ("<a href="Ceratophyllus">Ceratophyllus</a>") have been recorded on chicks as well.

The pigeon guillemot is considered to be a <a href="least%20concern%20species">least concern species</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. This is due to multiple factors, including its large population, estimated at 470,000 individuals, its stable population, and its large range, as this bird is thought to occur over a range of . This bird is vulnerable to introduced mammalian predators, such as raccoons. The removal of introduced predators from breeding islands allows the species to recover. Climate change has a negative effect on this bird, and reproductive performance decreases with increased temperatures. It is also particularly vulnerable to oil, and adults near oiled shores display symptoms of <a href="hepatocellular%20injury">hepatocellular injury</a>, where elevated levels of <a href="aspartate%20aminotransferase">aspartate aminotransferase</a> can be found in the liver. Otherwise, the effects of oil spills on the pigeon guillemot are unclear. Unlike some seabirds, ingestion of plastic does not seem to be a problem for this species.

Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)

William Joseph "Tiger" O'Reilly (20 December 19056 October 1992) was an Australian <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er, rated as one of the greatest bowlers in the history of the game. Following his retirement from playing, he became a well-respected cricket writer and broadcaster.

O'Reilly was one of the best <a href="spin%20bowling">spin bowlers</a> ever to play cricket. He delivered the <a href="Cricket%20ball">ball</a> from a two-fingered grip at close to <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">medium pace</a> with great accuracy, and could produce <a href="leg%20break">leg break</a>s, <a href="googly">googlies</a>, and <a href="topspinner">top spinners</a>, with no discernible change in his action. A tall man for a spinner (around 188 cm, 6 ft 2 in), he whirled his arms to an unusual extent and had a low point of delivery that meant it was very difficult for the batsman to read the flight of the ball out of his hand. When O'Reilly died, <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Sir Donald Bradman</a> said that he was the greatest bowler he had ever faced or watched. In 1935, "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>" wrote of him: "O'Reilly was one of the best examples in modern cricket of what could be described as a 'hostile' bowler." In 1939, "Wisden" reflected on Bill O'Reilly's successful <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201938">1938</a> <a href="The%20Ashes">Ashes</a> tour of England: "He is emphatically one of the greatest bowlers of all time."

As a <a href="batsman">batsman</a>, O'Reilly was a competent right-hander, usually batting well down the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Lower%20order%20or%20tail">order</a>. O'Reilly's citation as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1935 said: "He had no pretensions to grace of style or any particular merit, but he could hit tremendously hard and was always a menace to tired bowlers."

As well as his skill, O'Reilly was also known for his competitiveness, and bowled with the aggression of a <a href="fast%20bowler">paceman</a>. In a short biographical essay on O'Reilly for the "Barclays World of Cricket" book, his contemporary, the <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> cricketer <a href="Ian%20Peebles">Ian Peebles</a>, wrote that "any scoring-stroke was greeted by a testy demand for the immediate return of the ball rather than a congratulatory word. Full well did he deserve his <a href="sobriquet">sobriquet</a> of 'Tiger'."

Of <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a> descent, O'Reilly's paternal grandfather Peter emigrated from <a href="County%20Cavan">County Cavan</a>, <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a> in 1865. Arriving in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, he had been a policeman for four years in Ireland and continued in this line of work in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. He was sent to <a href="Deniliquin">Deniliquin</a> in the <a href="Riverina">Riverina</a>, where he settled and married another Irish immigrant Bridget O'Donoghue from <a href="Ballinasloe">Ballinasloe</a>, <a href="County%20Galway">County Galway</a>. O'Reilly's father, Ernest, was a school teacher and moved around the areas surrounding the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a> to study and teach. O'Reilly's mother Mina (née Welsh) was of mixed Irish and English descent, of a third generation family from <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. O'Reilly was born in the <a href="opal">opal</a> mining town of <a href="White%20Cliffs%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">White Cliffs, New South Wales</a>. Ernest had been appointed to open the first school in the town, and had helped to build the school and its furniture himself. Bill was the fourth child in the family, with two elder brothers and a sister.

O'Reilly's cricket skills were largely self-taught; his family moved from town to town whenever his father was posted to a different school, he had little opportunity to attend coaching. He learned to play with his brothers, playing with a "<a href="Eucalyptus">gum-wood</a> bat and a piece of <a href="banksia">banksia</a> root chiselled down to make a ball." He learned to bowl because his older brothers dominated the batting rights. His bowling action was far from the classic <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> bowler's run-up and delivery, indeed, according to "Wisden", "he was asked to make up the numbers in a Sydney junior match and, with a method that at first made everyone giggle, whipped out the opposition". From a young age, O'Reilly was a tall and gangly player.

In January 1908, shortly after Bill had turned two, the family moved to <a href="Murringo%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Murringo</a>, after Ernest was appointed the headmaster. O'Reilly said in his autobiography "Tiger" that the move played no vital part in his cricket education. The area had much more vegetation than the desolate White Cliffs, and an Irish Australian majority. O'Reilly later described the period as the happiest of his life. There the children played tennis on a court on their property and took up cricket. During this time, O'Reilly's mother gave birth to another son and two more daughters. In 1917, at the age of 12, the family moved to the town of <a href="Wingello%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wingello</a>. Ernest made the decision because there were no high schools near Murringo and his older children were about to finish primary school. Nevertheless, there was no high school in Wingello where Ernest had been appointed headmaster, so O'Reilly had to catch a train to <a href="Goulburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Goulburn</a>—50 km away—to study at the local public secondary school, where his elder brother Tom had been awarded a scholarship. Wingello was a cricket town and "everyone was a cricket crank" according to O'Reilly. It was here that he developed a passion for the game. O'Reilly played in the town's team and also won the regional tennis championships. O'Reilly bowled with an action reminiscent of the windmill that his family erected in the town. However, school life was difficult, especially in the winter, as the Southern Tablelands were harsh and cold. The O'Reilly children had to leave Wingello at 7.45 am by rail and caught a slow goods train that delivered them home at 7 pm; these vehicles did not provide protection against the weather, and the boys did not participate in any school sport as the only train home left after the end of classes.

In the early 1920s, O'Reilly's eldest brother Jack moved to Sydney. One afternoon, Jack watched spin bowler <a href="Arthur%20Mailey">Arthur Mailey</a> in the North Sydney practice nets and managed to describe the famous bowler's '<a href="Googly">Bosie</a>' action in a letter to Bill. O'Reilly claims to have perfected the action of changing the spin from anticlockwise to clockwise without any discernible hand movement within a couple of days. O'Reilly said that "The bosie became my most prized possession. I practised day in, day out". 
Ernest decided that the train journeys and frozen limbs were too much for his son, so he sent Bill to <a href="St%20Patrick%27s%20College%2C%20Goulburn">St Patrick's College, Goulburn</a> as a boarder in 1921, where he quickly showed his athletic flair by becoming a member of the school's <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a>, <a href="tennis">tennis</a>, <a href="Athletics%20%28sport%29">athletics</a> and cricket teams. He held a state record for the <a href="hop%2C%20step%20and%20jump">triple jump</a>. At the same time, he also represented the town team. During his time at St Patrick's, O'Reilly developed his ruthless and parsimonious attitude towards bowling. After three years at the Irish Catholic school, funded by a scholarship, O'Reilly completed his Leaving Certificate.

O'Reilly won a scholarship to the Sydney Teachers College at <a href="Sydney%20University">Sydney University</a>, to train as a schoolmaster. However, the financial assistance was only for two years and merely sufficient for O'Reilly's rent at <a href="Glebe%20Point">Glebe Point</a>. When he was in Sydney, O'Reilly received an invitation to join an athletics club based on his performances in Goulburn, but was only able to join after the secretary Dick Corish waived his membership fee. Jumping 47 feet, he came second in a <a href="triple%20jump">triple jump</a> competition behind <a href="Nick%20Winter">Nick Winter</a>, who went on to win gold in the event at the <a href="1924%20Summer%20Olympics">1924 Summer Olympics</a> with a world record of 50 ft. O'Reilly also placed second in a high jumping competition, clearing six feet. Corish was also a cricket administrator and invited O'Reilly to play in a <a href="David%20Jones%20Limited">David Jones</a> Second XI. Not knowing anything of his new recruit's abilities, Corish did not allow O'Reilly to bowl until he explicitly complained of only being allowed to field. O'Reilly promptly finished off the opposition's innings by removing the middle and lower order. After an encounter with journalist <a href="Johnny%20Moyes">Johnny Moyes</a>, who wrote glowingly about O'Reilly's skills.

While training as a teacher, O'Reilly joined the <a href="Sydney%20University%20Regiment">Sydney University Regiment</a>, a unit of the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia Forces</a> (Army Reserve). He did not enjoy his time in the military, and along with most of his peers, regarded the <a href="commanding%20officer">commanding officer</a> as inept. O'Reilly was a non-conformist who did not enjoy taking orders, and was unimpressed with the firearm drills, because the recruits were armed only with wooden sticks. However, he signed up for a second year to raise money for his education. Fed up with military routines he considered to be pointless, O'Reilly volunteered to be a kitchen hand.

During a vacation, O'Reilly caught the train from Sydney back to Wingello, which stopped at <a href="Bowral">Bowral</a> mid-journey. There, Wingello were playing the host town in a cricket match, and O'Reilly was persuaded to interrupt his journey to help his teammates. This match marked his first meeting with Bowral's 17-year-old Don Bradman, later to become his Test captain. O'Reilly himself later described thus:
The wicket ended a period of suffering for O'Reilly at the hands of Bradman, who had hit many <a href="four%20%28cricket%29">fours</a> and <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">sixes</a> from him. Bradman's counter-attack came after he had been dropped twice from O'Reilly's bowling before reaching 30 by Wingello's captain Selby Jeffery. On the first occasion, the ball hit Jeffery in the chest while he was lighting his pipe; soon after the skipper failed to see the ball "in a dense cloud of bluish smoke" as he puffed on his tobacco. The match was the start of a long on-field relationship between the pair, who were to regard one another as the best in the world in their fields. O'Reilly recalled that Bradman "knew what the game was all about".

O'Reilly did not enjoy his time at the overcrowded Sydney Teachers College (STC), decrying the lack of practical training and the predominance of pedagogical theory. Regarding it as a waste of time, he happily accepted an offer of work experience from Major Cook-Russell, the head of physical education at STC, to help at Naremburn College instead of attending lectures. This angered Professor Alexander Mackie, the head of STC, whom both Cook-Russell and O'Reilly regarded as incompetent.

O'Reilly's initial posting after abandoning his training was to a government school in <a href="Erskineville%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Erskineville</a>, a inner-city suburb in Sydney. At the time, the suburb was slum-like and impoverished, with many unruly students. Many of the pupils were barely clothed and tested O'Reilly's ability to discipline. He said that he learned more in three months there under Principal Jeremiah Walsh than he would have in ten years at STC. Major Cook-Russell then started a military cadet program in New South Wales schools; O'Reilly started such a program at Erskineville and his students won the statewide competition "in a canter". O'Reilly's time at Erskineville also marked the start of work-sport conflicts that hampered his cricket career. He joined <a href="North%20Sydney%20Cricket%20Club">North Sydney Cricket Club</a> in 1926–27 and was selected at short notice to play in an invitational match under retired Australian captain <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a> at the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>. As the education department required a week's notice for leave requests, O'Reilly declined, but was then ordered by the Chief Inspector of Schools to play after turning up at school on the morning of the match. Having taken six wickets, the match was then washed out, and O'Reilly then had his pay deducted, much to his chagrin.

O'Reilly was selected for the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> practice squad based on his performance in a single match for North Sydney against Gordon in 1927–28. In this game, he bowled Moyes—a state selector—with a medium paced <a href="leg%20break">leg break</a>. At state training, O'Reilly's new teammate and Test leg spinner <a href="Arthur%20Mailey">Arthur Mailey</a> advised him to adopt a more conventional grip, but the 19th century Test bowler <a href="Charles%20Turner%20%28Australian%20cricketer%29">Charles Turner</a>, known as "Terror Turner" and famous for his unorthodox ways, told O'Reilly to back his self-styled technique. O'Reilly decided to listen to Turner.

After taking a total of 3/88 in a Second XI match against <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a>, O'Reilly made his first-class debut in the <a href="1927-28%20Australian%20cricket%20season">1927–28</a> season, playing in three matches and taking seven wickets. In his first match, against <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a>, O'Reilly took 2/37 and 1/53. He then played in what would be his only <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> match for several years, going wicketless against <a href="Queensland%20Bulls">Queensland</a>, before returning figures of 4/35 against <a href="Tasmanian%20Tigers">Tasmania</a>.

In 1928, O'Reilly was transferred by the New South Wales Education Department to <a href="Griffith%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Griffith, New South Wales</a>, an outback town in the south-west of the state, and he was unable to play first-class cricket. Over the next three years he moved around the country, including postings to <a href="Rylstone%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Rylstone</a> and <a href="Kandos%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kandos</a>.
Teaching duties may have cost O'Reilly an early entry into <a href="Test%20cricket">Test cricket</a>, as many young players were introduced in the 1928–29 home series against <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> following a large number of retirements of older players.
In the meantime, O'Reilly taught English to primary school children in Griffith, as well as singing—most of the pieces were Irish. At Rylstone he taught book-keeping and business, and he was promoted to the high school at Kandos. During this time he supplemented his income by travelling from town to town, playing in one-off cricket matches at the expense of the host's club. He worked on his bosie during the period and regularly dismissed outclassed opposition batsmen. O'Reilly regarded his cricketing isolation as highly beneficial as he regarded coaches to be ill-advised and detrimental to development.

In late 1930, O'Reilly was posted to <a href="Kogarah%20Intermediate%20High%20School">Kogarah Intermediate High School</a> in the southern Sydney suburb of <a href="Kogarah%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kogarah</a>, where he taught English, history, geography and business. O'Reilly resumed playing for North Sydney, confident that with an improved bosie, he was much more potent than before his rural teaching stint. As he only arrived back in Sydney in the second half of the 1930–31 season, O'Reilly was not considered for first-class selection, but he took 29 wickets at 14.72 for North Sydney. 

In the 1931–32 season he emerged as the successor to Mailey in the New South Wales side. Within half a dozen games, he was one of several young players introduced to the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team">Australian cricket team</a> for the Fourth <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> in a badly one-sided <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201931-32">series</a> against <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a>. However, matters could have been rather different. O'Reilly had broken into the team for New South Wales' away matches against <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a> and Victoria while the Test players were on international duty. He totaled only 2/81 in the first match and was then informed that he would be dropped after the second fixture. O'Reilly responded by bowling with a more attacking strategy, taking 5/22 and 2/112. At the end of the match, New South Wales' stand-in captain, the leg spinning <a href="all%20rounder">all rounder</a> <a href="Reginald%20Bettington">Reginald Bettington</a>, declared O'Reilly "the greatest bowler in the world", and although few agreed with this claim, Bettington made himself unavailable for selection so that O'Reilly would not be dropped. The reprieved leg spinner took a total of 8/204 in his next two matches, and while the figures were not overwhelming, they were enough to ensure a Test berth; with an unassailable 3–0 lead, the selectors wanted to blood new players.

O'Reilly took four wickets on his debut at the <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a>, two in each innings, supporting the senior leg-spinner, <a href="Clarrie%20Grimmett">Clarrie Grimmett</a>, who took 14 wickets in the match and with Bradman scoring 299 <a href="not%20out">not out</a>, Australia won the match. O'Reilly retained his place when the selectors kept the winning side for the final match of the Test series at <a href="Melbourne%20cricket%20ground">the MCG</a>. On a <a href="sticky%20wicket">pitch made treacherous by rain</a>, he did not bowl at all when South Africa were bowled out for just 36 in the first innings, and came on only towards the end of the second innings, when he took three wickets as the touring side subsided to 45 all out. He ended his first Test series with seven wickets at 24.85. In <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> cricket in the 1931–32 season, O'Reilly took 25 wickets at an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of 21 runs per wicket, highlighted by his maiden ten-wicket haul, 5/68 and 5/59 in a home match against South Australia after the Tests were over as New South Wales took out the title.
The following year he was more successful, taking 31 wickets at just 14 runs each. New South Wales won the competition in both seasons.

O'Reilly became a regular member of the Australian Test side in the 1932–33 season and he played in all five Tests against <a href="English%20cricket%20team">England</a> in the infamous <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a> series. The Australian selectors perceived that O'Reilly would be their key bowler, and as he had never played against the English, omitted him from the early tour matches so that the tourists would not be able to decode his variations. As a result, he missed the Australian XI match against the Englishmen in Melbourne. In two Shield matches ahead of the Tests, he took 14 wickets, including a total of 9/66 in an innings win over Queensland. Although the national selectors had hidden him from the Englishmen, New South Wales declined to do so, and he played for his state a week ahead of the Tests. The hosts were bombarded with short-pitched bowling and heavily beaten by an innings; O'Reilly took 4/86 as the visitors amassed 530, dismissing leading English batsman <a href="Wally%20Hammond">Wally Hammond</a> in the first of many battles between the pair.

The Tests started at the SCG and O'Reilly was the team's leading wicket-taker for the series with 27 wickets. O'Reilly not only took most wickets but he also bowled by some distance the most <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">over</a>s on either side, and he achieved a <a href="Cricket%20statistics%23Bowling%20statistics">bowling economy</a> of less than two runs from each of his 383 eight-ball <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a>. In the first match, he took 3/117 from 67 overs as England amassed 530 and took a ten-wicket victory. While his figures suggested that he bowled poorly—none of his wickets were those of batsmen—he beat the batsmen repeatedly. Between Tests, O'Reilly took 11 wickets in two Shield matches.

In the Second Test in Melbourne, O'Reilly opened the bowling as Australia opted to use only one pace bowler on a turning pitch. After Australia had made only 228, O'Reilly trapped <a href="Bob%20Wyatt">Bob Wyatt</a> <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> (lbw) before bowling both the <a href="Iftikhar%20Ali%20Khan%20Pataudi">Nawab of Pataudi</a> and <a href="Maurice%20Leyland">Maurice Leyland</a> to leave England at 4/98. He later took two tail-end wickets to end with 5/63 and secure Australia a first innings lead. Defending a target of 251, O'Reilly bowled the leading English opener <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a> for 33 with a textbook perfect leg break that pitched on leg stump and clipped the top of the off stump. According to English team manager <a href="Plum%20Warner">Plum Warner</a>, Sutcliffe had never been defeated so comprehensively. O'Reilly also removed Hammond on the way to ending with 5/66 and securing a 111-run win. The ten-wicket haul was O'Reilly's first at Test level and the start of his strong career record over the English. However, Australia were not to taste further success. The controversial "<a href="leg%20theory">fast leg theory</a>" bowling used by England under newly appointed <a href="English%20national%20cricket%20captains">captain</a> <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a> brought the touring team victories in the last three matches: Australia were handicapped not only by the tactics, but also by a lack of quality <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowlers</a>; O'Reilly also opened the bowling in both the Third and Fourth Tests in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> and <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> respectively due to the selection of only one paceman. He was hindered by a decline in the form of Grimmett, who was dropped after the Third Test. O'Reilly took 2/83 and 4/79 in Adelaide, collecting the wicket of Sutcliffe for single figures in the first innings of a match overshadowed by near-riots after captain <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a> was struck in the heart. Australia were crushed by 338 runs, and lost the series in Brisbane. After O'Reilly had taken 4/101—including Sutcliffe and Jardine—in the first innings to keep Australia's first innings deficit to 16, the hosts collapsed to be 175 all out. O'Reilly took one wicket in the second innings of a six-wicket loss. The final Test in Sydney took a similar course; O'Reilly took 4/111 in the first innings including Sutcliffe and Jardine again, as the tourists took a 14-run lead before completing an eight-wicket win after another Australian collapse. O'Reilly was wicketless in the second innings and bowled 72 overs in total in the match. Reflecting on the performance of O'Reilly in the series, R Mason said "here we saw the first flexing of that most menacing genius".

In the 1933–34 season, with no Test series in Australia, O'Reilly finished top of the Sheffield Shield bowling averages, taking 33 wickets at an average of 18.30, but he had an inconsistent run. He started the season with 6/58 and 7/53 in an innings win over Queensland. After managing only three wickets across two consecutive testimonial matches, O'Reilly went wicketless against South Australia. He was angered by the subsequent comments in newspapers that he had already passed his zenith, and returned to form against <a href="Victorian%20cricket%20team">Victoria</a> at the MCG. After claiming 3/92 in the first innings, he took 9/50 in the second innings. The nine wickets included six Test players, including leading batsmen Woodfull and <a href="Bill%20Ponsford">Bill Ponsford</a>. Given his heavy workload in the previous season, it was decided to keep O'Reilly fresh for the subsequent tour of England, so he played in only two of the last three matches, with a reduced bowling load, taking eight wickets. During the season, Bradman moved to North Sydney from <a href="St%20George%20Cricket%20Club">St George Cricket Club</a> to captain the team, and it was the only summer in which O'Reilly played alongside Bradman at grade level. The following year, O'Reilly moved to St George, which was near Kogarah, as they were obliged to play for a team in their area of residence.

O'Reilly was selected for the tour of England in 1934, where he and Grimmett were the bowling stars as Australia regained <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a>. They began by taking 19 of the 20 England wickets to fall in a comfortable victory in the First Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>. O'Reilly's match figures were 11 wickets for 129 runs, and taking seven for 54 in his second innings was to produce his best Test figures.

England then won the Second Test at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, aided by the weather and Australia's inability to force the issue by avoiding the follow on. The hosts batted first and made 440, O'Reilly removing Walters. In reply, Australia were 2/192 when rain struck on the second evening and the sun turned the pitch into a <a href="sticky%20wicket">sticky wicket</a> the next day. When O'Reilly came in at 8/273, only 17 runs were needed to avoid the follow on, but he misjudged the flight of a <a href="Hedley%20Verity">Hedley Verity</a> delivery and was bowled, thinking the ball to be fuller than it was and missing a lofted drive. Australia fell six runs short and were forced to bat again when the pitch was at its worst. They were bowled out again on the same afternoon as Verity took 14 wickets in a day. O'Reilly always regretted his dismissal, as he believed that if he had helped to avoid the follow on, he would have taken "six wickets without removing his waistcoat" and that Australia could have then chased the target in better conditions on the fourth day.

O'Reilly shook English confidence in the Third Test, played on a placid surface at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a>, by taking three wickets in four balls. <a href="Cyril%20Walters">Cyril Walters</a>, who up to that point had been untroubled, failed to pick the bosie and thus inside edged the ball to short leg. <a href="Bob%20Wyatt">Bob Wyatt</a> came in and was clean bowled for a <a href="Duck%20%28cricket%29">golden duck</a>, bringing Hammond in to face the hat-trick ball. The new batsman inside edged the ball past the stumps and through the legs of wicket-keeper <a href="Bert%20Oldfield">Bert Oldfield</a>, but the next delivery clean bowled him. This left England at 3/72, and O'Reilly removed Sutcliffe soon after, but the batsmen settled down and the next wicket did not come until Hendren fell just before the end of the first day's play. England were 5/355 and O'Reilly had taken each wicket. The next day, the hosts ended on 9/627, despite a relentless 59 overs from O'Reilly, who ended with 7/189 and was the only bowler to challenge the batsmen. The high-scoring match never looked likely to produce a result, except when Australia were in danger of being forced to follow on. They were 55 runs away from the follow on mark of 478 at the end of the third day with two wickets in hand, and O'Reilly was on one. The next day <a href="Arthur%20Chipperfield">Arthur Chipperfield</a> fell with 24 runs still needed and O'Reilly and Wall saw them to 491 before the latter fell. O'Reilly ended with 30 not out after an innings in which he was lucky not to be caught off an edge multiple times.

A further draw at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a>, with England saved by rain after a Bradman <a href="List%20of%20Test%20cricket%20triple%20centuries">triple century</a>, set up a match to decide the series at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>. As the series was still alive, the match was timeless, rather than the customary five-day contest. After Australia made 701, O'Reilly took 2/93 to help dismiss the hosts for 321. The visitors then made 327 to set a target of 708 for victory. O'Reilly claimed 2/58, including Hammond, while Grimmett, with a total of eight wickets, proved the decisive bowler as Australia regained The Ashes with victory by 562 runs, which, more than 70 years on, is still the second largest margin of victory in terms of runs in any Test match.

O'Reilly was the leading Australian bowler of the tour, taking 28 Test wickets at an average of less than 25, while Grimmett took 25 wickets at just under 27 runs apiece. Australia's other Test bowlers took only 18 wickets between them. On the tour as a whole, O'Reilly headed the tourists' averages, with 109 wickets at 17.04, which meant that he also topped the averages for the whole English cricket season. In the matches against the English counties, he took 11 wickets in each of the games against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a> and <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>, and in the match against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>, after <a href="Hans%20Ebeling">Hans Ebeling</a> took the first wicket, he took the remaining nine for 38 runs, and that proved to be the best innings figures of his career. He was named as one of the <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a> in 1935 for his deeds on tour.

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> against <a href="Scotland%20cricket%20team">the hosts</a>, and O'Reilly top-scored in a match for Australia for the only time, in the first of the two games. Having been allowed to open the innings after complaining about his lack of opportunities, he top-scored with 47 ahead of McCabe's 16. He found the tour to be a happy and healing experience after the acrimony of the Bodyline series.
O'Reilly played little state cricket for New South Wales in 1934–35; at the time, his first child was born and he took time off to ponder his future employment. He played in only one Shield match, against arch-rivals Victoria, and in the testimonial match for the retiring Woodfull and Ponsford. He took a total of eight wickets at 31.37 in these matches.

O'Reilly played no Shield cricket the following season, when he was selected for the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20South%20Africa%20in%201935-36">Australian tour</a> to South Africa. Although Bradman had been vice-captain under Woodfull in 1934, he did not travel to South Africa on grounds of ill health, but played a full domestic season despite this. The team was captained by <a href="Vic%20Richardson">Victor Richardson</a>, and O'Reilly publicly described it as the happiest tour he had been on—he was one of several players who did not get along with Bradman.

The tour was another triumph for the leg-spin attack of O'Reilly and Grimmett, but O'Reilly was slightly overshadowed by his teammate in the Tests. With 44 wickets, Grimmett set a new record for the number of wickets by an Australian in a Test series, and he raised his Test career total to 216 wickets, beating the then world record of 189 by Englishman <a href="Sydney%20Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a>. O'Reilly took 27 Test wickets at an average of just over 17 runs each: the other bowlers in the Australian team took 27 wickets between them. On the tour as a whole, O'Reilly came out ahead of Grimmett, with 95 wickets against Grimmett's 92, and an average of 13.56 against 14.80. O'Reilly also revealed hitherto undiscovered batting talents, making an undefeated 56 in the Fourth Test in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, and putting on 69 for the last wicket with <a href="Ernie%20McCormick">Ernie McCormick</a>. It was the only time in his <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> career that he passed 50. During the tour, O'Reilly developed his <a href="leg%20trap">leg trap</a>; the opening batsmen <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a> and <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a> were used in these positions.

With Bradman's appointment as captain of the Australian team after the South African tour, <a href="Clarrie%20Grimmett">Clarrie Grimmett</a> was dropped, leaving O'Reilly as the hub of the Australian bowling attack for the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">MCC</a> Ashes tour in 1936–37.

O'Reilly was strongly aggrieved by the removal of his long-time bowling partner, and maintained that it was an "unpardonable" error that heavily weakened Australia's bowling attack. However, he remained vague about why he thought Grimmett had been removed, even though suspicion dogged Bradman. Grimmett continued to dominate the wicket-taking on domestic cricket, while his replacements struggled in the international arena.

O'Reilly responded by becoming the leading Australian wicket-taker in the series taking 25, with <a href="Bill%20Voce">Bill Voce</a> taking 26 for England. However, he almost failed to take to the field; O'Reilly and several players had threatened to withdraw after vice-captain <a href="Stan%20McCabe">Stan McCabe</a>'s wife was forbidden from sitting in the Members' Stand in the First Test. The Australian Board of Control backed down, but it was the start of a tumultuous season.

O'Reilly's wickets were at increased cost—his average increased to 22 runs per wicket—and he took five wickets in an innings only once, in the First Test at the <a href="Brisbane%20Cricket%20Ground">'Gabba</a> in Brisbane, which England won convincingly. The circumstances of the series determined O'Reilly's role: after England won the first two Tests, O'Reilly appeared to have been given the job not just of bowling the opposition out, but also of containing them, and he was criticised in "Wisden" for defensive bowling. "Wisden" even went as far as to describe it as "leg theory". If the intention was to stifle England batsman <a href="Wally%20Hammond">Wally Hammond</a> in particular, then it appears to have worked, but O'Reilly's figures for the series suggest he was consistent but not always penetrative. <a href="Morris%20Sievers">Morris Sievers</a>, from fewer matches, outperformed his average; <a href="Leslie%20Fleetwood-Smith">Leslie Fleetwood-Smith</a>, a slow left-arm spinner, got more eye-catching individual figures, including 10 wickets in the victory at Adelaide. Whatever the methods, they were successful: having lost the first two Tests, Australia proceeded to win the final three to retain The Ashes they had regained in England in 1934, and O'Reilly's five for 51 and three for 58 were the best figures in the decisive Fifth Test in Melbourne.

In the 1937–38 season, O'Reilly returned to more regular state cricket, and New South Wales duly won the Sheffield Shield for the first time in five seasons. He took 33 wickets at an average of just over 14 runs each, and against <a href="South%20Australia%20cricket%20team">South Australia</a> at Adelaide he repeated his feat against Somerset in 1934, taking the last nine wickets of the first innings at a cost of 41 runs. This time, he followed up with five for 57 in the second innings.

O'Reilly's second and final Ashes tour to England as a player in 1938 again saw him as the most effective bowler in the team. His final record of 22 wickets at an average of 27.72 in the four Tests—the Third Test was rained off without a ball being bowled—was marginally less than 1934, and in all matches he took 104 wickets at 16.59. In its report of the tour, however, "Wisden"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 1939 edition noted that "it was nothing short of remarkable that despite the moderate support accorded to him he bowled so consistently well and so effectively." Again, O'Reilly was often used defensively where there was no help from the wicket, but, "Wisden" added, "when... the wicket gave him the least encouragement he robbed the greatest batsmen of initiative, and was most destructive".

O'Reilly took 3/164 on a batting paradise in the First Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a> as England scored 8/658 and forced Australia to follow on and hold on for a draw. In the Second Test at Lord's O'Reilly took 4/93 in the first innings and trapped <a href="Eddie%20Paynter">Eddie Paynter</a> for 99 to end a 222-run partnership with Hammond. In reply to England's 494, Australia were in danger of being forced to follow on; O'Reilly came in and made 42, featuring in a partnership of 85 in only 46 minutes with <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a> that enabled Australia to save the match: having been dropped by Paynter, he hit <a href="Hedley%20Verity">Hedley Verity</a> for consecutive sixes to take Australia past the <a href="follow-on">follow-on</a> mark. Brown recalled "It was a nice day, and a nice wicket. O'Reilly came in, and I told him I'd take the quicks—<a href="Arthur%20Wellard">Wellard</a> and <a href="Ken%20Farnes">Farnes</a>—and Tiger [O'Reilly] took Verity." Australia reached 422 and O'Reilly took 2/53 in the second innings as the match petered into a draw.

In an otherwise high-scoring series, O'Reilly's greatest triumph was in the low-scoring Fourth Test at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a>, where he exploited a difficult pitch to take five wickets in each innings as Australia secured the victory that enabled them to retain the Ashes. With the series level at 0–0, England captain Hammond elected to bat first; O'Reilly's 5/66 was largely responsible for ending England's innings at 223. He removed Hammond, who had top-scored with 76, <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a> and <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a>, all bowled in quick succession. England were 1/73 on the third day, an overall lead of 54, when O'Reilly began a new spell after Bradman had switched his ends. <a href="Joe%20Hardstaff%20junior">Joe Hardstaff junior</a> hooked him for four and the next ball was <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a>ed by the umpire. O'Reilly was reported to have become visibly enraged; he bowled Hardstaff next ball and then removed Hammond for a golden duck. This precipitated an English collapse to 123 all out, and O'Reilly ended with 5/56 and a total of 10/122. O'Reilly effort proved to be crucial as Australia scraped home by five wickets just 30 minutes before black clouds brought heavy rain, which would have made batting treacherous. The victory ensured the retention of the Ashes, and O'Reilly ranked it as his finest performance, alongside his ten wickets in the Second Bodyline Test of 1932–33.

Australia had retained the Ashes, but England struck back at The Oval, where they posted the then-record Test score of 7/903. Early on, O'Reilly trapped Edrich lbw for 12, to secure his 100th Test wicket against England. In a timeless match, <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> made a world record Test score of 364 in a fastidious and watchful innings of 13 hours, surpassing Bradman's 334. When he was on 333, O'Reilly deliberately bowled two no-balls in an attempt to break Hutton's concentration by tempting him to hit out, but the Englishman blocked them with a straight bat.

O'Reilly eventually removed Hutton and ended with 3/178 off 85 overs. Nevertheless, these compared favourably with Fleetwood-Smith's 1/298 off 87 overs. O'Reilly was the only Australian to take more than a solitary wicket, and rated Hutton's knock as the finest innings played against him. Australia collapsed to lose by an innings and 579 runs, the heaviest defeat in Test history. O'Reilly's lack of success went with The Oval Test in 1934, when he took a total of 4/151.

O'Reilly scaled back his participation in Sheffield Shield cricket in the 1938–39 season, making himself unavailable for most of the campaign to spend time with his newborn son after half a year in England; he played in only two matches, against South Australia and arch-rivals Victoria. He took a ten-wicket haul in the latter match, but his figures of 6/152 and 4/60 were not enough to prevent defeat. Both teams were at full strength and eight of O'Reilly's victims were Test players, including batsman <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> twice. O'Reilly's only other match was for Bradman's XI against <a href="Keith%20Rigg">Rigg's XI</a> in a match to commemorate the centenary of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>, in which he took a total of 7/129, to end the season with 19 wickets at 23.16.

He resumed regular service for New South Wales in the next season, taking 55 wickets at 15.12 in seven matches. He took 8/23 and 6/22 to set up an innings win over Queensland and 6/77 and 4/62 in another victory over South Australia. The two matches against Victoria were shared as O'Reilly took 17 wickets. In the second of the matches, in Sydney, Hassett became the only person to score centuries in both innings of match involving O'Reilly. Despite Hassett's feat, New South Wales won the match; O'Reilly took a total of 8/157. 

O'Reilly continued his strong run in 1940–41, taking 55 wickets at 12.43 in eight matches. He took nine wickets in three consecutive matches, once for McCabe's XI in a match against Bradman's XI, which his team won by an innings, and in both matches against Victoria, which were split between the two states. First-class cricket was ended after one match in 1941–42; O'Reilly took a total of 9/124 in a loss to Queensland before the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> signaled the start of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in the Pacific. In the meantime, O'Reilly continued to play for St George and topped the grade competition's bowling averages for years from 1941–42 onwards. He averaged between 8 and 9 in all these seasons, and took more than 100 wickets in three consecutive summers, peaking with 147 in 1943–44. O'Reilly had tried to enlist in the military in 1941, but after presenting himself for the medical, was informed that his employer was deemed a "protected undertaking", so their workers were not allowed to enlist.

First-class cricket resumed in Australia in 1945–46 after the end of the war, although the Shield competition was not held that season. O'Reilly captained New South Wales at the age of 40, and although the emergence of <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> and <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a> in the state side indicated a shift in emphasis away from spin and towards faster bowling, O'Reilly maintained his pre-war standards. He took 33 wickets at 14.36 in six matches and New South Wales were undefeated; they won four matches and drew both fixtures against Victoria. He took at least two wickets in every innings and claimed his innings best of 6/43 against Queensland. O'Reilly also took a match total of 7/94 in an innings win over the <a href="Australian%20Services%20cricket%20team">Australian Services team</a>, which had drawn a series against a full-strength England team.

O'Reilly's final first-class cricket came on a four-match tour by an Australian team to <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> in early 1946. O'Reilly was the vice-captain of the team, which was led by <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a>. The main fixture during the tour was a four-day match against a representative <a href="New%20Zealand%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a> side in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>, retrospectively designated as the first Test between the two countries in 1948. The uncertain nature of the tour saw the Australians wear blazers labeled ABC for <a href="Cricket%20Australia">Australian Board of Control</a>, rather than the usual coat of arms. New Zealand were outclassed; after winning the toss and electing to bat on a rain-affected pitch, they made 42 in their first innings and 54 in their second to lose by an innings and 103 runs. O'Reilly took 5/14 in the first innings, and 3/19 in the second, dominating with Toshack. It was his last Test and his last first-class game. O'Reilly dominated in the other tour games as well; he took match totals of 9/103 and 8/128 against <a href="Auckland%20cricket%20team">Auckland</a> and <a href="Otago%20cricket%20team">Otago</a> respectively, and ended with 28 wickets at 10.60 for the tour. Having only decided to tour New Zealand after much consideration, O'Reilly retired at the end of the Test, throwing his boots out of the dressing room window.

Despite the mutual admiration between Bradman and O'Reilly for their cricket skills, personal relations between the pair were strained. In Australian society at the time, sectarian tension existed between <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholics</a>, mostly of <a href="Ireland">Irish</a> descent, of whom O'Reilly was one, and <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>s, like Bradman. Bradman was a <a href="teetotal">non-drinker</a> and a reserved character, often preferring to read quietly, rather than socialize or drink with his teammates. Coupled with his on-field dominance, this led to perceptions that Bradman was cocky and distant from his teammates. In the late 1930s, the <a href="Australian%20Board%20of%20Control">Australian Board of Control</a> summoned O'Reilly, <a href="Stan%20McCabe">Stan McCabe</a>, <a href="Leo%20O%27Brien%20%28cricketer%29">Leo O'Brien</a> and <a href="Chuck%20Fleetwood-Smith">Chuck Fleetwood-Smith</a>, all Catholics of Irish descent to a meeting to discuss the apparent schism in the team. <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, a trained journalist, was not invited to the meeting, but after the deaths of both Fingleton and O'Reilly, Bradman penned a letter in which he accused the former of being the ringleader. O'Reilly's eventual departure also raised speculation that a purge had occurred. In 1995, after both Fingleton and O'Reilly had died, Bradman wrote: "With these fellows out of the way, the loyalty of my 1948 side was a big joy and made a big contribution to the outstanding success of that tour"; the Australians went through the 1948 English summer undefeated.

O'Reilly became a journalist, and together with Fingleton, he often criticized Bradman. They were in the press box when Bradman was bowled for a duck in his final Test innings, when they were reported to have become hysterical with laughter. Nevertheless, O'Reilly kept most of his strongest feelings about Bradman to himself and suppressed them from his autobiography; he would say of Bradman that "You don't piss on statues". Before his death, O'Reilly gave a series of interviews to the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Australia">National Library of Australia</a>, in which he accused Bradman of purging Grimmett from the team because Grimmett had joked that Bradman had ensured his own dismissal in a match against Victoria, to avoid facing the express pace of <a href="Ernie%20McCormick">Ernie McCormick</a>.

According to cricket historian <a href="Gideon%20Haigh">Gideon Haigh</a>, "O'Reilly was a man of embedded prejudices". In retirement, O'Reilly complained to a board member that "You have to play under a Protestant to know what it's like". The Test umpire <a href="Col%20Egar">Col Egar</a> recalled that O'Reilly never talked to him in their decades in cricket until a third party informed the bowler that Egar was a Catholic.

Despite their conflicts, a few years before his death O'Reilly wrote that, compared with Bradman, batsmen like <a href="Greg%20Chappell">Greg Chappell</a> and <a href="Allan%20Border">Allan Border</a> were mere "child's play".

In 1933, O'Reilly married Mary Agnes "Molly" Herbert, after less than six months of courtship. Of Irish stock, Molly had been introduced to O'Reilly through one of his teaching colleagues at Kogarah, who married Molly's elder sister the following year. The couple then moved to the southern Sydney suburb of <a href="Hurstville%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Hurstville</a>. The couple had two children, a girl followed by a boy.

O'Reilly continued to work as a school teacher after he broke into international cricket, but at the end of 1934, after missing more than six months of the year in England, he resigned from his government post, reasoning that his career could not progress if he was going to be overseas so often. However, he had not made any plans for his future employment. Soon after, O'Reilly received an offer to work as a sportsgoods salesman for the department store <a href="David%20Jones%20Limited">David Jones</a> with sporting leave entitlements. The <a href="Premier%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Premier of New South Wales</a>, <a href="Bertram%20Stevens%20%28politician%29">Bertram Stevens</a>, tried to coax O'Reilly into staying in the government education system, offering him a post at <a href="Sydney%20Boys%20High%20School">Sydney Boys High School</a> if he returned to STC to complete the Bachelor of Arts that he had abandoned a decade before.

In 1935, O'Reilly took up an appointment at <a href="Sydney%20Grammar%20School">Sydney Grammar School</a>, one of the leading private schools in the state, having been offered 50% paid leave for his cricket commitments. There he taught English, history and business. In 1939 he took a job in the sports store of close friend, teammate and fellow Irish Catholic <a href="Stan%20McCabe">Stan McCabe</a>, which was located on <a href="George%20Street%2C%20Sydney">George Street</a>, the city centre's main thoroughfare. O'Reilly was a financial partner in the business, but following the outbreak of World War II, the sales revenue began to suffer and O'Reilly left as the store would not be able to support two stakeholders.

O'Reilly then accepted a position as a manager of the Lion Tile Company at <a href="Auburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Auburn</a>, in Sydney's western suburbs. He remained in the position until 1976. O'Reilly was responsible for the financial and accounting affairs of the firm, which expanded to employ more than 200 workers. He was held in high regard and granted full paid leave when he thrice went overseas for six months to cover tours of England as a journalist. <a href="Doc%20Evatt">Doc Evatt</a>, a leading <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> politician attempted to recruit O'Reilly into politics, but was unsuccessful.

During the late-1930s, O'Reilly mentored the then-teenaged <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> and <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> at St. George. He converted Morris from a <a href="left%20arm%20unorthodox%20spin">left arm unorthodox spin</a>ner into an opening batsman, and exhorted Lindwall to become a specialist express paceman. Both had long Test careers and captained their country and are regarded as all-time Australian greats in the fields that O'Reilly chose for them—both were chosen with O'Reilly in the <a href="Australian%20Cricket%20Board%20Team%20of%20the%20Century">ACB Team of the Century</a>. The pair credited O'Reilly as being the main influence in their careers, and Lindwall made his Test debut in O'Reilly's last Test in 1946.

In 1956–57, McCabe and O'Reilly were given a testimonial match by the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Cricket%20Association">New South Wales Cricket Association</a>. The match was between <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Harvey's XI</a> and <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Lindwall's XI</a> and acted as a trial for the non-Test tour of New Zealand. It raised 7,500 pounds, which was split between McCabe and O'Reilly and would have bought two average-sized homes in Sydney at the time.

On retirement as a player, O'Reilly became a cricket columnist for "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>", remaining in that position until his health declined in 1988. His first engagement was <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201946-47">England's tour of Australia in 1946–47</a>, and during this season he began a partnership with the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" of <a href="London">London</a>, going on to cover several Ashes series for them. O'Reilly's articles for "The Sydney Morning Herald" were reproduced in its sister publication, "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" of <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. Later, his writing was syndicated to newspapers in India, South Africa and New Zealand. His style was described by "Wisden" as "muscular, very Australian... flavoured with wit and imagery ('You can smell the <a href="Eucalyptus">gum</a>-leaves off him', he wrote of one <a href="rural">country boy</a> just starting with Queensland)." <a href="Jack%20McHarg">Jack McHarg</a> said that "The clarity, wit and pungency of his writing, together with almost infallible judgment, never deserted him", even as his health began to restrict him. He was a highly respected and forthright pundit, who hated <a href="one-day%20cricket">one-day cricket</a>, describing it as "hit and giggle". He condemned the omission of <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> in 1949–50 and said that to call it "a complete surprise would be a cowardly way of describing a botch". Reacting to the selection of the dour batting <a href="all%20rounder">all rounder</a> <a href="Ken%20Mackay">Ken Mackay</a>, he wrote "words fail...to express adequately my contempt for this howler". In 1952 he had a falling-out with Lindwall after condemning his protégé for bowling five consecutive <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncers</a> at <a href="Everton%20Weekes">Everton Weekes</a> in a Test. In comparison with his illustrious contemporary on-field and on paper, "while <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Sir Donald</a> walked the corridors of cricketing power O'Reilly was the rumbustious <a href="backbencher">backbencher</a>." In 1956, O'Reilly strongly criticised Australian captain <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a>, a Melburnian, for his leadership during the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201956">1956 Ashes tour</a>. "The Age" took exception to this and asked their sister publication to rein in their pundit. O'Reilly refused to shy away from his opinions and was dropped by the Melbourne publication. In the 1980s, when <a href="Bob%20Simpson%20%28cricketer%29">Bob Simpson</a> became the first coach of Australia, O'Reilly, himself self-taught, spoke out against the creation of such posts. He was a strong critic of the breakaway <a href="World%20Series%20Cricket">World Series Cricket</a>, the commercialization of the sport and the erosion of the social norms that were followed during his playing career.

Aside from his autobiography, O'Reilly wrote two books; "Cricket Conquest: The Story of the 1948 Test Tour", published in 1949, and "Cricket Task Force", published in 1951. They were accounts of the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">"Invincibles" tour of England in 1948</a> and <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201950-51">England's Ashes tour to Australia in 1950–51</a>.

Upon retiring from "The Sydney Morning Herald", O'Reilly wrote in a column
O'Reilly was honored with several accolades late in his life. In 1980, he was awarded an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> for his services to cricket as a player and writer. In 1985, the oval in Wingello was renamed in his honor, and in 1988, a grandstand at the SCG was named the Bill O'Reilly Stand. In the same year, the oval in White Cliffs was renamed, and "The Sydney Morning Herald" renamed the medal they awarded to the best player in grade cricket in O'Reilly's honour. During the celebrations for the <a href="Australian%20Bicentenary">Australian Bicentenary</a>, O'Reilly was named among the 200 people, and only 21 living, who had contributed the most to the country since European settlement.

O'Reilly's later years were troubled with poor health, including the <a href="amputation">loss of a leg</a>. In late 1988, he suffered a major heart attack and was hospitalized for two months. He died in hospital in <a href="Sutherland%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Sutherland</a> in 1992, 75 days short of his 87th birthday. O'Reilly lamented the decline of spin during his twilight years, and in the 1980s he was often derided by younger people who felt that his advocacy of spin bowling—which they deemed to be obsolete—was misplaced. He died just months before <a href="Shane%20Warne">Shane Warne</a> revived the art of leg spin on the international stage.

In 1996, O'Reilly was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Australian%20Cricket%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Australian Cricket Hall of Fame</a> as one of the ten inaugural members. In 2000, O'Reilly was named in the <a href="Australian%20Cricket%20Board%20Team%20of%20the%20Century">Australian Cricket Board Team of the Century</a>, and in 2009 he was named among the 55 inaugural inductees of the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">International Cricket Council</a>'s <a href="ICC%20Cricket%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a>, being formally inducted in January 2010.

In his 18-season <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class</a> career, O'Reilly took 774 wickets at an average of 16.60. In his 27 Test matches, O'Reilly took 144 wickets at 22.59, 102 of them in his 19 Ashes Tests against England.

It has been retrospectively calculated by the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">International Cricket Council</a>'s <a href="ICC%20cricket%20ratings">LG Ratings</a> that he was the best bowler in the world for much of his career.

Eve (U.S. TV series)

Eve is an American television <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a>, created by Meg DeLoatch, which originally aired for three seasons on <a href="UPN">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN) from September 15, 2003 to May 11, 2006. Featuring an <a href="ensemble%20cast">ensemble cast</a> consisting of <a href="Eve%20%28rapper%29">Eve</a>, <a href="Jason%20George">Jason George</a>, <a href="Ali%20Landry">Ali Landry</a>, <a href="Natalie%20Desselle-Reid">Natalie Desselle-Reid</a>, <a href="Brian%20Hooks">Brian Hooks</a>, and <a href="Sean%20Maguire">Sean Maguire</a>, the show revolves around two sets of male and female friends attempting to navigate relationships with the opposite sex. The <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a>s were <a href="Robert%20Greenblatt">Robert Greenblatt</a> and David Janollari; the series was produced by <a href="The%20Greenblatt/Janollari%20Studio">The Greenblatt/Janollari Studio</a> and Mega Diva Inc. in association with <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Television">Warner Bros. Television</a> for UPN.

The series was developed as a <a href="star%20vehicle">vehicle</a> for Eve under the working title "The Opposite Sex"; UPN executives approached the rapper about a television project after the success of fellow musician <a href="Brandy%20Norwood">Brandy</a> in another of the network's sitcoms—"<a href="Moesha">Moesha</a>". Eve's series was created as part of the network's attempt to appeal to a younger audience. After being picked up, the show was renamed "Eve" to attract the rapper's fans. The series was set in Miami, but filmed at <a href="Sunset%20Gower%20Studios">Sunset Gower Studios</a> in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, Los Angeles. Eve said that she was intimidated at first by the process of preparing for and filming a sitcom, and she would later regret not fully committing to her character. The show was distributed by UPN in its original run, and later by <a href="TV%20One%20%28U.S.%20TV%20network%29">TV One</a>. UPN had promoted "Eve" as part of its new comedy block, one of four new comedies developed by the network.

"Eve" suffered from low viewership in spite of its high ratings among young African American women; it was canceled following UPN's merger with <a href="The%20WB">The WB Television Network</a> (The WB) to launch <a href="The%20CW">The CW</a> in 2006. The series' cancellation, along with that of other <a href="black%20sitcom">black sitcom</a>s, was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African American characters and the number of roles for African American actors on television. Critical response to "Eve" was mixed; some praised its inclusion as a part of UPN's line-up of black sitcoms, but others felt Eve lacked charisma, and that the series was inferior to other black sitcoms. Despite the negative reception, the show and Eve received several award nominations. The series was released on the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> and <a href="Amazon%20Video">Amazon Video</a>.

"Eve" revolves around Miami fashion designer Shelly Williams (<a href="Eve%20%28rapper%29">Eve</a>), "a woman whose fashion career is on the move [but whose] her love life is a work in progress". At the start of the series, Shelly has been unable to find a suitable partner for ten months. She begins an <a href="on-again%2C%20off-again%20relationship">on and off relationship</a> with physical therapist J.T. Hunter (<a href="Jason%20George">Jason George</a>), which is nearly derailed when he cries while they watch <a href="Casablanca%20%28film%29">"Casablanca"</a> on their first date. Both characters turn to two of their close friends for advice on the opposite sex, love, and relationships. Shelly frequently looks for advice from former model Rita Lefleur (<a href="Ali%20Landry">Ali Landry</a>) and married friend Janie Egins (<a href="Natalie%20Desselle-Reid">Natalie Desselle-Reid</a>), while J.T. finds support in his best friends nightclub manager Donovan Brink (<a href="Sean%20Maguire">Sean Maguire</a>) and <a href="IRS">IRS</a> worker Nick Dalaney (<a href="Brian%20Hooks">Brian Hooks</a>).

Episodes typically depict the friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues, such as Shelly, Rita, and Janie working together at their Miami-based fashion boutique DivaStyle and J.T. applying to colleges. The six characters each have many dates and serious relationships, and the series can be viewed as an extension of the concept of "the battle of the sexes" for its equal representation of both male and female viewpoints on the matter. Janie serves as Shelly's voice of reason, while Rita encourages her to be more impulsive with dating. They often disagree with one another on the best way for Shelly to approach her love life. Rita, Janie, Nick, and Donovan are typically shown caught in the middle of Shelly and J.T.'s miscommunications.

Even though Shelly and J.T.'s relationship is the predominant storyline, the series does explore the relationships of its supporting cast; Donovan and Rita date each other, and the quite selective Nick attempts to find the perfect partner. Donovan owns the Z Lounge, which is described as "one of Miami's hottest clubs" and serves as one of the places where the group often meets. Other frequently recurring characters include Shelly's younger love interest Grant (<a href="Sharif%20Atkins">Sharif Atkins</a>), Janie's husband Marty (Reggie Gaskins), and Shelly's mother Beverly (<a href="Penny%20Johnson%20Jerald">Penny Johnson Jerald</a>). Several celebrities also make cameo appearances on the show, including <a href="Queen%20Latifah">Queen Latifah</a>, <a href="Missy%20Elliott">Missy Elliott</a>, <a href="Brooke%20Burke">Brooke Burke</a>, <a href="Vivica%20A.%20Fox">Vivica A. Fox</a>, and <a href="Cedric%20the%20Entertainer">Cedric the Entertainer</a>.

The first season introduces the six main characters: Shelly, J.T., Rita, Janie, Nick, and Donovan. Shelly runs the fashion boutique DivaStyle with her friends Janie and Rita. She pursues a relationship with J.T., only to discover he is afraid of commitment and exhibits some <a href="chauvinism">chauvinistic</a> behavior. Their relationship is often tested by frequent misunderstandings. Nick wants to find his ideal partner, but his attempts are typically thwarted as he is very particular about women. Even though his relationship with a woman named Dani appears to be successful, they soon break up. Donovan finds himself romantically attracted to Rita, but he resists the temptation out of fear of ruining their friendship.

Shelly and J.T. break up at the beginning of the second season and pursue a <a href="casual%20sex">friends with benefits</a> relationship. After discovering that she is bankrupt, Rita moves in with Janie to save money. She also begins a relationship with Donovan. When Janie becomes annoyed with Rita for staying at her home for a long time, Rita persuades J.T. and Nick to let her stay with them instead. Shelly finds herself attracted to a younger man, and J.T. becomes jealous realizing that he is in love with her. In the season finale, both men propose to Shelly. At the same time, Donovan's application for <a href="permanent%20residency">residency</a> is rejected and the friends prepare for his return to England.

In the third-season premiere, Shelly accepts J.T.'s marriage proposal. Donovan gets a work visa after finding a job selling makeup products for a British company. Shelly and J.T. break up again, resolving to remain just friends. J.T. pursues a career in medicine and enrolls in the Miami State Medical School. He finds out that college is more difficult than he first thought, and struggles with his classes and finances. During the spring, Rita reignites her relationship with Donovan and buys her own apartment. In the series' finale, Beverly finally admits to Yusef, Shelly's father, that she is carrying his child; Shelly questions his ability to be a father again. The series ends in a <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a>, with Janie, Rita, and Donovan arrested for illegally selling <a href="BOTOX">BOTOX</a> at DivaStyle.

<a href="UPN">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN) executives approached Eve about developing a television project following her performance of her rap single "<a href="Gangsta%20Lovin%27">Gangsta Lovin'</a>" (2002) at an event marking the channel's 2002 season premieres. The network had pitched the idea to her prior to her appearances in the 2002 films <a href="XXX%20%282002%20film%29">"XXX"</a> and <a href="Barbershop%20%28film%29">"Barbershop"</a>. Following their release, UPN renewed its interest in pursuing a series with Eve. She had developed the main premise behind the sitcom, in which she would star as a fashion designer with a supporting <a href="multi-ethnic">multi-ethnic</a> ensemble. The show's creation was credited to television producer Meg DeLoatch. UPN executives designed the series as a <a href="star%20vehicle">vehicle</a> for Eve following the positive response to fellow musician <a href="Brandy%20Norwood">Brandy</a> in another UPN sitcom, "<a href="Moesha">Moesha</a>".

Eve accepted the role as a way to showcase a different side of her personality that was unexplored in her music. Her co-star Jason George commented that the show allowed the audience to see Eve as more than a <a href="hardcore%20rap">hardcore rap</a> artist, saying: "The part that people know the least about her comes across most in this show: There's a seriously girlie girl side to her." DeLoach emphasized the difference between Eve and her character Shelly Williams by saying: "She's bringing so much of herself to the role of Shelly but she's playing a character. Some of the things Shelly does aren't necessarily what Eve would do." To further distinguish herself as an actor, Eve decided against singing the show's theme song.

Publicized as the "Untitled Eve Project" in an early press release, the series had the working title "The Opposite Sex" before it was changed to reflect Eve's status as the star. Eve initially resisted the change and felt that "The Opposite Sex" was a stronger choice, but described it as a "corporate decision". According to her, UPN executives explained that the title would better attract the rapper's fans. They also felt that the audience would not be confused by the title "Eve", despite Eve playing a character named Shelly. After the title was established, the show's premise was modified slightly, but remained centered around male and female friends discussing their love lives, and navigating their relationships with the opposite sex. While Eve described the series as "the <a href="Motion%20picture%20content%20rating%20system">PG</a> version of "<a href="Sex%20and%20the%20City">Sex and the City</a>"", DeLoatch promoted "Eve" as unique for incorporating both male and female perspectives on dating and love. She further described the sitcom as "focus[ing] on one relationship and follow[ing] all of the ups and downs in it" with the purpose of "showing the male and female points of view". To achieve this goal, DeLoatch included male writers in the discussions of potential episodes and storylines to hear their input.

Production was handled by <a href="The%20Greenblatt/Janollari%20Studio">The Greenblatt/Janollari Studio</a>, Mega Diva Inc, and <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Television">Warner Bros. Television</a>. <a href="Robert%20Greenblatt">Robert Greenblatt</a> and David Janollari served as the series' <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a>s. DeLoatch, <a href="Troy%20Carter%20%28music%20industry%29">Troy Carter</a>, David Duclon, and Eve also contributed to the series as co-executive producers. Rapper Missy Elliott wrote and performed the theme song, which was produced by <a href="Soul%20Diggaz">Soul Diggaz</a>. "Eve" was one of four new comedies developed by UPN for the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">2003–04 television season</a>, as part of a "new comedy block" including "<a href="All%20of%20Us">All of Us</a>", <a href="Rock%20Me%20Baby%20%28TV%20series%29">"Rock Me Baby,"</a> and "<a href="The%20Mullets">The Mullets</a>". A writer from <a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">"Today"</a> described UPN's enlistment of Eve into a comedy as an example of the network's attempt to form its own identity through targeting a younger, multi-ethnic audience. In his book "TV-a-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol", Jake Austen identified "Eve" as part of a trend in which musicians were prominently featured as the stars of television programs; he cited Brandy's role in "Moesha" and Queen Latifah on "<a href="Living%20Single">Living Single</a>" as two other examples.

By the time the series was officially announced during UPN's broadcast <a href="upfront%20%28advertising%29">upfront</a> presentations, Ali Landry, Natalie Desselle-Reid, and Brian Hooks were confirmed to be playing Rita, Janie, and Nick respectively. <a href="Bumper%20Robinson">Bumper Robinson</a> was originally scheduled to portray J.T., but was later replaced by Jason George for undisclosed reasons. The role of Donovan was also recast, with the original actor <a href="Eddie%20McClintock">Eddie McClintock</a> removed in favor of Sean Maguire. The supporting cast of Landry, Desselle-Reid, Hooks, and Maguire were described by Tom Jicha of the "<a href="Sun-Sentinel">Sun-Sentinel</a>" as "peripheral" since they were written to "servic[e] the highs and lows of the romance between Shelly and J.T." With Shelly and J.T.'s relationship as the heart of the sitcom, Janollari expressed hopes that the episodes would follow them "from their meeting in the <a href="television%20pilot">pilot</a>, through the steps of a normal relationship, all the way, hopefully to marriage". In the fall of 2006, <a href="TV%20One%20%28U.S.%20TV%20network%29">TV One</a> began broadcasting the series as part of an agreement with Warner Bros. Domestic Cable Distribution. Along with "All of Us", "Eve" was the first time in which the channel acquired the rights for shows that were currently airing on network television.

Even though the show was set in Miami, filming took place at <a href="Sunset%20Gower%20Studios">Sunset Gower Studios</a> in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, Los Angeles. <a href="Stock%20footage">Stock exterior shots</a> of Miami were used for the <a href="opening%20credits">opening credits</a> and transitions between scenes. The series was filmed with a <a href="multiple-camera%20setup">multiple-camera setup</a>, with each episode last roughly 20 to 22 minutes excluding commercials. Eve said she was initially intimidated by the amount of work required to prepare for and film a television series. During an interview with <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a>, she explained that while filming the first season she felt like she "just wanted to leave because there was so much to learn, it's just a different world". Since she found comedy to be challenging due to the "certain beats you have to learn", Eve hired two acting coaches to help improve her timing. One of her coaches was <a href="Chip%20Fields">Chip Fields</a>, who visited the show's set to offer Eve acting advice. During the development of the second season, Eve viewed the set as her home, and felt the process was easier, having grown closer to the cast and crew. In a 2016 interview with "<a href="Grazia">Grazia</a>", she revealed her regret at not fully committing herself to her character and the series. She explained: "I was the youngest person on set and was clubbing in between being on set and learning my lines. I look back and wish I was more dedicated. But I learned from it."

The show, as well as a majority of UPN's programs, was officially canceled when the network merged with <a href="The%20WB">The WB Television Network</a> (The WB) to form <a href="The%20CW">The CW</a> in 2006. Fern Gillespie of "<a href="The%20Crisis">The Crisis</a>" was critical of UPN's decision to cancel the series given how the network "in one swoop, wiped out five of its eight African American comedies" with the creation of The CW. Gillespie expressed disappointment at the lack of African American sitcoms on the <a href="Big%20Three%20television%20networks">three major networks</a>, saying: "Without that opportunity for some of the younger artists to hone and develop their skills, it will potentially have a generational impact." <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a>'s Dara T. Mathis identified "Eve" as an example of UPN's notable <a href="black%20sitcom">black sitcom</a>s and equated the cancellations of a majority of UPN's comedies as a sign that the genre was in a state of decline. Critic Tim Goodman noted that "Eve" was one of six shows "geared for an African American audience", featuring "an African American lead actress" that were canceled during the merger. He viewed these cancellations as a sign of networks "eliminat[ing] niche programming". Julian Kimble of <a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">"Complex"</a> included "Eve" on a list of programs that "are often forgotten about", alongside other UPN sitcoms "<a href="Half%20%26amp%3B%20Half">Half & Half</a>" and "All of Us". The series has not been made available on Blu-ray or DVD, but it was released on the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> and <a href="Amazon%20Video">Amazon Video</a>.

"Eve" has received mixed feedback since its first broadcast. Melanie McFarland of the "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>" praised the changes made during the show's development and highlighted Maguire as the standout. In reference to its transformation from the original pilot, she described "Eve" as the "<a href="Eliza%20Doolittle">Eliza Doolittle</a> of UPN comedies". The supporting cast was praised by David Hinckely of the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>", who wrote that they "form an entertaining and appropriately neurotic chorus behind Eve's relationship dance". "Eve" was compared to the UPN comedy "<a href="Girlfriends%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Girlfriends</a>" by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" Alessandra Stanley, who regarded Eve as an appropriate lead with "an appealingly tough edge that matches the paw-print tattoos on her chest". Brian Josephs of <a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">"Spin"</a> shared positive memories of African-American television shows on UPN, identifying Monday nights on the network as the place "where Eve transformed from Ruff Ryder to sitcom actress". "Eve" was listed by scholar Jake Austen as one of the shows "that emerged in the wake of the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights era</a>" that served as "a dynamic showcase for black creativity". Tom Jicha provided a less enthusiastic review, stating that "Eve" was "just another cookie-cutter sitcom".

"Eve" drew criticism for its formulaic writing, and the lead's poor performance. The show was included on a list by <a href="Ebony%20%28magazine%29">"Ebony"</a>'s Kevin L. Clark profiling the top ten worst black television shows of all time. Clark was critical of the episodes' titles, such as "Condom Mania", "She Snoops to Conquer" and "Porn Free", and wrote that they indicated an overuse of "outrageous clichés that boob-tube audiences would come to know and love once reality TV hit its boon". Arianna Davis of <a href="Refinery29">Refinery29</a> negatively compared "Eve" to <a href="1990s%20in%20television">1990s</a> black sitcoms, and determined that it was a part of the "rollout of campy shows [...] that felt less like purposeful programming and more like cheap attempts at copying a successful advertising model". The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" Mimi Avins felt that the show lacked the spark and the writing quality of "Sex and the City", identifying Eve as its weakest link. She felt that Eve did not show "the acting ability or high-voltage charisma that vaulted <a href="Will%20Smith">Will Smith</a> from rapper to television star" in "<a href="The%20Fresh%20Prince%20of%20Bel-Air">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a>". During her review of the original pilot, Melanie McFarland wrote that the sitcom lacked any potential due to Eve's poor performance on top of the "[t]errible scenery, cheap costumes and a few glaring miscasts". Eve's decision to distance the series from her identity as a rapper was questioned by Roger Catlin of the "<a href="Hartford%20Courant">Hartford Courant</a>", who felt that the character of Shelly could have used "the personality charge" from Eve's life. Despite finding Eve a charismatic presence, Catlin felt that her acting, along with that of Ali Landry, was poorly-developed. Echoing Catlin's assessment, the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Gate">San Francisco Gate</a>"s Tim Goodman was critical of Eve and Landry's performance. Goodman also wrote that the show was an example of "the worst writing on television", citing its homophobic jokes and its reliance on clichés.

In spite of the mixed reception from <a href="television%20criticism">television critics</a>, the show, and Eve's performance, received several award nominations. In 2004, the show was nominated for the <a href="Teen%20Choice%20Awards">Teen Choice Award</a> for <a href="Teen%20Choice%20Award%20for%20Choice%20Breakout%20Series">Choice Breakout TV Show</a>. Eve was also nominated for Choice TV Actress – Comedy in the same year. Eve was nominated again for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress: Comedy in 2005. She also received two nominations for the <a href="Kids%27%20Choice%20Awards">Blimp Award for Favorite Television Actress</a> during the 2005 and 2006 <a href="Kid%27s%20Choice%20Awards">Kid's Choice Awards</a>. Eve earned a nomination for the 2005 <a href="Image%20Awards">Image Award</a> for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series, and the 2005 <a href="BET%20Awards">BET Awards</a> Comedy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

Prince George of Denmark

Prince George of Denmark and Norway, Duke of Cumberland (; 2 April 165328 October 1708), was the husband of <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>, who reigned over <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> from 1702 to 1714.

His marriage to Anne was arranged in the early 1680s with a view to developing an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain Dutch maritime power. As a result, George was unpopular with his Dutch brother-in-law, <a href="William%20III%20of%20Orange">William III of Orange</a>, who was married to Anne's elder sister, <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary</a>. William and Mary became joint monarchs of Britain, with Anne as their <a href="heir%20presumptive">heir presumptive</a>, in 1689 after the "<a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>" deposed <a href="James%20II%20and%20VII">James II and VII</a>, the father of both Anne and Mary.

William excluded George from active military service, and neither George nor Anne wielded any great influence until after the deaths of Mary and then William, at which point Anne became queen. During his wife's reign, George occasionally used his influence in support of his wife, even when privately disagreeing with her views. He had an easy-going manner and little interest in politics; his appointment as <a href="Lord%20High%20Admiral%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lord High Admiral</a> in 1702 was largely honorary.

Anne's seventeen pregnancies by George resulted in twelve miscarriages or stillbirths, four infant deaths, and a chronically sick son, <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">William</a>, who died at the age of eleven. Despite the history of their children, George and Anne's marriage was a strong one. George died aged 55 from a recurring and chronic lung disease, much to the devastation of his wife, and he was buried in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

George was born in <a href="Copenhagen%20Castle">Copenhagen Castle</a>, and was the younger son of <a href="Frederick%20III%20of%20Denmark">Frederick III</a>, <a href="King%20of%20Denmark">King of Denmark</a> and <a href="King%20of%20Norway">Norway</a>, and <a href="Sophie%20Amalie%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>. His mother was the sister of <a href="Ernest%20Augustus%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>, later <a href="Elector%20of%20Hanover">Elector of Hanover</a>. From 1661, his governor was <a href="Otto%20Grote%20zu%20Schauen">Otto Grote</a>, later Hanoverian minister to Denmark. Grote was "more courtier and statesman than educator" and when he left for the Hanoverian court in 1665, he was replaced by the more effective <a href="Christen%20Jensen%20Lodberg">Christen Lodberg</a>. George received military training, and undertook a <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a> of Europe, spending eight months in 1668–69 in France and mid-1669 in England. His father died in 1670, while George was in Italy, and George's elder brother, <a href="Christian%20V%20of%20Denmark">Christian V</a>, inherited the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Denmark">Danish throne</a>. George returned home through Germany. He travelled through Germany again in 1672–73, to visit two of his sisters, <a href="Princess%20Anna%20Sophie%20of%20Denmark">Anna Sophia</a> and <a href="Princess%20Wilhelmine%20Ernestine%20of%20Denmark">Wilhelmine Ernestine</a>, who were married to the <a href="Prince-elector">electoral princes</a> of <a href="John%20George%20III%2C%20Elector%20of%20Saxony">Saxony</a> and the <a href="Charles%20II%2C%20Elector%20Palatine">Palatinate</a>.

In 1674, George was a candidate for the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish</a> <a href="Royal%20elections%20in%20Poland">elective throne</a>, for which he was backed by <a href="King%20Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">King Louis XIV of France</a>. George's staunch <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> was a barrier to election in <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Poland, and <a href="John%20Sobieski">John Sobieski</a> was chosen instead. In 1677, George served with distinction with his elder brother Christian in the <a href="Scanian%20War">Scanian War</a> against Sweden. His brother was captured by the Swedes at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Landskrona">Battle of Landskrona</a>, and George "cut his way through the enemies' numbers, and rescued him at the imminent danger of his own life."

As a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>, George was considered a suitable partner for the niece of <a href="King%20Charles%20II%20of%20England">King Charles II of England</a>, <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Lady Anne</a>. They were distantly related (second cousins once removed; they were both descended from <a href="King%20Frederick%20II%20of%20Denmark">King Frederick II of Denmark</a>), and had never met. George was hosted by Charles II in London in 1669, but Anne had been in France at the time of George's visit. Both Denmark and Britain were Protestant, and Louis XIV was keen on an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain the power of the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a>. Anne's uncle <a href="Laurence%20Hyde%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Rochester">Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester</a>, and the English <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Northern%20Department">Secretary of State for the Northern Department</a>, <a href="Robert%20Spencer%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Sunderland">Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland</a>, negotiated a marriage treaty with the Danes in secret, to prevent the plans leaking to the Dutch. Anne's father, <a href="James%2C%20Duke%20of%20York">James, Duke of York</a>, welcomed the marriage because it diminished the influence of his other son-in-law, Dutch <a href="Stadtholder">Stadtholder</a> <a href="William%20III%20of%20Orange">William III of Orange</a>, who was naturally unhappy with the match.

George and Anne were married on 28 July 1683 in the <a href="Chapel%20Royal">Chapel Royal</a> at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, by <a href="Henry%20Compton%20%28bishop%29">Henry Compton</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>. The guests included King Charles II, <a href="Catherine%20of%20Braganza">Queen Catherine</a>, and the Duke and <a href="Mary%20of%20Modena">Duchess of York</a>. Anne was voted a parliamentary allowance of £20,000 a year, while George received £10,000 a year from his Danish estates, although payments from Denmark were often late or incomplete. King Charles gave them a set of buildings in the <a href="Palace%20of%20Whitehall">Palace of Whitehall</a> known as <a href="Cockpit-in-Court">the Cockpit</a> (near the site of what is now <a href="Downing%20Street">Downing Street</a> in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>) as their London residence.

George was not ambitious, and hoped to live a quiet life of domesticity with his wife. He wrote to a friend: "We talk here of going to tea, of going to Winchester, and everything else except sitting still all summer, which was the height of my ambition. God send me a quiet life somewhere, for I shall not be long able to bear this perpetual motion."

Within months of the marriage, Anne was pregnant but the baby, a girl, was stillborn in May. Anne recovered at the <a href="spa%20town">spa town</a> of <a href="Tunbridge%20Wells">Tunbridge Wells</a>, and over the next two years, she gave birth to two daughters in quick succession, Mary and Anne Sophia. In early 1687, within a matter of days, George and his two young daughters caught <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, and Anne suffered another miscarriage. George recovered, but both his daughters died. <a href="Lady%20Rachel%20Russell">Lady Rachel Russell</a> wrote that George and Anne had "taken [the deaths] very heavily. The first relief of that sorrow proceeded from the threatening of a greater, the Prince being so ill of a fever. I never heard any relation more moving than that of seeing them together. Sometimes they wept, sometimes they mourned in words; then sat silent, hand in hand; he sick in bed, and she the carefullest nurse to him that can be imagined." He returned to Denmark for a two-month visit in mid-1687, while Anne remained in England. Later that year, after his return, Anne gave birth to another dead child, this time a son.

In February 1685, King Charles II died without legitimate issue, and George's father-in-law, the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> Duke of York, became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. George was appointed to the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a> and invited to attend Cabinet meetings, although he had no power to alter or affect decisions. William of Orange refused to attend James's <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">coronation</a> largely because George would take precedence over him. Although they were both sons-in-law of King James, George was also the son and brother of a king and so outranked William, who was an elected stadtholder of a republic.

Anne's older sister <a href="Mary%20II%20of%20England">Mary</a> had moved to the Netherlands after her marriage to William of Orange. Protestant opposition to James was therefore increasingly focused around Anne and George instead of Mary, who was <a href="heir%20presumptive">heir presumptive</a>. The social and political grouping centred on George and Anne was known as the "Cockpit Circle" after their London residence. On 5 November 1688, William invaded England in an action, known as the "<a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>", which ultimately deposed King James. George was forewarned by the Danish envoy in London, Frederick Gersdorff, that William was assembling an invasion fleet. George informed Gersdorff that James's army was disaffected, and as a result he would refuse any command under James, but only serve as an uncommissioned volunteer. Gersdorff's alternative plan to evacuate George and Anne to Denmark was rejected by George. George accompanied the King's troops to Salisbury in mid-November, but other nobles and their soldiers soon deserted James for William. At each defection, George apparently exclaimed, ""Est-il possible?"" (Is it possible?). He abandoned James on 24 November, and sided with William. "So 'Est-il possible' is gone too", James supposedly remarked. In his memoirs, James dismissed George's defection as trivial, saying the loss of one good trooper was of more consequence, but Gersdorff claimed the defection greatly perturbed the King. The defection of George and other nobles was instrumental in whittling away the King's support. In December, James fled to France, and early the following year William and Mary were declared joint monarchs, with Anne as heir presumptive.

In early April 1689, William assented to a bill naturalizing George as an English subject, and George was created <a href="Duke%20of%20Cumberland">Duke of Cumberland</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Kendal">Earl of Kendal</a> and Baron of Okingham (Wokingham) by the new monarchs. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 20 April 1689, being introduced by the Dukes of <a href="Charles%20Seymour%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Somerset</a> and <a href="James%20Butler%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Ormonde">Ormonde</a>.

The mistrust between George and William was set aside during the revolution of 1688–89 but dogged relations during the latter's reign. George held mortgages on <a href="Femern">Femern</a>, <a href="Tremsb%C3%BCttel">Tremsbüttel</a> and <a href="Steinhorst%2C%20Schleswig-Holstein">Steinhorst, Schleswig-Holstein</a>, which he surrendered to the <a href="Christian%20Albert%2C%20Duke%20of%20Holstein-Gottorp">Duke of Holstein</a> as part of the peace of Altona of 1689 negotiated by William between Denmark and Sweden. William agreed to pay George interest and the capital in compensation, but George remained unpaid. During the <a href="Williamite%20War%20in%20Ireland">military campaign against James's supporters in Ireland</a>, George accompanied the Williamite troops at his own expense, but was excluded from command, and was even refused permission to travel in his brother-in-law's coach. Snubbed from the army by William, George sought to join the navy, without rank, but was again thwarted by his brother-in-law. When William's Dutch guards failed to salute George, Anne assumed they were acting under orders. George and Anne retired from court. Some degree of reconciliation was achieved following Queen Mary's sudden and unexpected death from smallpox in 1694, which made Anne <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a>. In November 1699, William finally recommended that Parliament pay the mortgage debt to George, and in early 1700, the debt was honoured.

By 1700, Anne had been pregnant at least seventeen times; twelve times, she miscarried or gave birth to stillborn children, and two of their five children born alive died within a day. The only one of the couple's children to survive infancy—<a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Prince William, Duke of Gloucester</a>—died in July 1700 at the age of 11. With Gloucester's death, Anne was the only person in the line of succession to the throne, as established by the "Glorious Revolution". To extend the line and secure the Protestant succession, Parliament passed the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement 1701</a>, which designated William and Anne's nearest Protestant cousins, the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">House of Hanover</a>, as the next in line after Anne.

George did not play a senior role in government until his wife Anne succeeded as queen on William's death in 1702. George was the chief mourner at William's funeral. Anne appointed him generalissimo of all English military forces on 17 April, and <a href="Lord%20High%20Admiral%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lord High Admiral</a>, the official but nominal head of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, on 20 May. Actual power at the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> was held by <a href="George%20Churchill%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">George Churchill</a>, whose elder brother was <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough</a>, a great friend of Anne's and the captain-general of English land forces. Prince George had known the Churchills for years: another brother <a href="Charles%20Churchill%20%28British%20Army%20general%29">Charles Churchill</a>, had been one of his <a href="Gentleman%20of%20the%20Bedchamber">gentlemen of the bedchamber</a> in Denmark, and Marlborough had accompanied George on his journey from Denmark to England for his marriage to Anne in 1683. George's secretary in the 1680s was Colonel Edward Griffith, brother-in-law of the <a href="Sarah%20Churchill%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Marlborough">Duchess of Marlborough</a>, who was Anne's close confidante and friend. George followed William III as Captain-General of the <a href="Honourable%20Artillery%20Company">Honourable Artillery Company</a>, and was made <a href="Lord%20Warden%20of%20the%20Cinque%20Ports">Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports</a>. Anne failed, however, in her attempts to persuade the <a href="States%20General%20of%20the%20Netherlands">States General of the Netherlands</a> to elect her husband captain-general of all Dutch forces, to maintain the unified command of the <a href="Maritime%20Powers">Maritime Powers</a> that William had held.

Anne obtained a parliamentary allowance of £100,000 a year for George in the event of her death. The bill sped through the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England">House of Commons</a> easily but it was only narrowly passed by the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. Marlborough supported the bill, but one of the lords against was Marlborough's son-in-law, <a href="Charles%20Spencer%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Sunderland">Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland</a>. Marlborough dissuaded her from asking Parliament to make "her dearly loved husband King Consort".

Generally, during her reign, Anne and her husband spent the winter at <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington</a> and <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a>s, and the summer at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a> or <a href="Hampton%20Court%20Palace">Hampton Court Palace</a>, where the air was fresher. George had recurrent <a href="asthma">asthma</a>, and the cleaner air in the country was better for his breathing. They visited the spa town of <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a>, in mid-1702, on the advice of George's doctors, and again in mid-1703. They occasionally visited <a href="Newmarket%2C%20Suffolk">Newmarket, Suffolk</a>, to view the <a href="horse%20racing">horse racing</a>. On one visit, Anne bought George a horse, Leeds, for the vast sum of a thousand <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a>.

At the end of 1702, the Occasional Conformity Bill was introduced to Parliament. The bill aimed to disqualify Protestant <a href="Dissenter">Dissenter</a>s from public office by closing a loophole in the <a href="Test%20Act">Test Act</a>s, legislation that restricted public office to <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> <a href="conformist">conformist</a>s. The existing law permitted <a href="nonconformist">nonconformist</a>s to take office if they took Anglican <a href="Eucharist">communion</a> once a year. Anne was in favour of the measure, and forced George to vote for the bill in the House of Lords, even though, being a practising <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>, he was an occasional conformist himself. As he cast his vote, he reportedly told an opponent of the bill, "My heart is vid you" . The bill did not gather sufficient parliamentary support and was eventually dropped. The following year, the bill was revived, but Anne withheld support, fearing its reintroduction was a deliberate pretence to cause a quarrel between the two main political groups: the <a href="Tory">Tories</a> (who supported the bill) and the <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whigs</a> (who opposed it). Once again it failed. George never became a member of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, which was headed by his wife throughout her reign. He remained Lutheran even after her accession, and had his own personal chapel.

In the first years of Anne's reign, the Whigs gained more power and influence at the expense of the Tories. In his capacity as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, George held influence in parliamentary boroughs on the south coast of England, which he used to support Whig candidates in the <a href="English%20general%20election%2C%201705">general election of 1705</a>. In that year's election for <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Speaker of the House of Commons</a>, George and Anne supported a Whig candidate, <a href="John%20Smith%20%28Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer%29">John Smith</a>. George instructed his secretary, <a href="George%20Clarke">George Clarke</a>, who was a <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a>, to vote for Smith, but Clarke refused, instead supporting the Tory candidate <a href="William%20Bromley%20%28speaker%29">William Bromley</a>. Clarke was sacked, and Smith was elected.

In March and April 1706, George was seriously ill. There was blood in his <a href="sputum">sputum</a>, but he seemed to recover, although he was too ill to attend a thanksgiving service at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> in June for a British victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ramillies">Battle of Ramillies</a>. He missed another thanksgiving service in May 1707, to celebrate the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">union of England and Scotland</a>, as he was recuperating at Hampton Court.

The <a href="Scilly%20naval%20disaster%20of%201707">Scilly naval disaster of 1707</a>, in which a fleet commanded by <a href="Cloudesley%20Shovell">Sir Cloudesley Shovell</a> foundered, highlighted mismanagement at the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>, for which George was nominally responsible. Pressure grew to replace Admiral Churchill with someone more dynamic. By October 1708, five powerful politicians, known as the <a href="Whig%20Junto">Whig Junto</a>—Lords <a href="John%20Somers%2C%201st%20Baron%20Somers">Somers</a>, <a href="Charles%20Montagu%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a>, <a href="Edward%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Orford">Orford</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Wharton%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Wharton">Wharton</a> and <a href="Charles%20Spencer%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Sunderland">Sunderland</a>—were clamouring for the removal of both Prince George and Churchill. Marlborough wrote to his brother telling him to resign, but Churchill refused, protected by Prince George.

Amid the political pressure, George was on his deathbed, suffering from severe <a href="asthma">asthma</a> and <a href="dropsy">dropsy</a>. He died at 1:30 p.m. on 28 October 1708 at <a href="Kensington%20Palace">Kensington Palace</a>. The Queen was devastated. <a href="James%20Brydges%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Chandos">James Brydges</a> wrote to <a href="William%20Cadogan%2C%201st%20Earl%20Cadogan">General Cadogan</a>,

His death has flung the Queen into an unspeakable grief. She never left him till he was dead, but continued kissing him the very moment his breath went out of his body, and 'twas with a great deal of difficulty my Lady Marlborough prevailed upon her to leave him.

Anne wrote to her nephew, <a href="Frederick%20IV%20of%20Denmark">Frederick IV of Denmark</a>, "the loss of such a husband, who loved me so dearly and so devotedly, is too crushing for me to be able to bear it as I ought." Anne was desperate to stay at Kensington with the body of her husband, but under pressure from the Duchess of Marlborough, she reluctantly left Kensington for St James's Palace. Anne resented the Duchess's intrusive actions, which included removing a portrait of George from the Queen's bedchamber and then refusing to return it in the belief that it was natural "to avoid seeing of papers or anything that belonged to one that one loved when they were just dead". Anne and the Duchess had been very close, but their friendship had become strained over political differences. The immediate aftermath of George's death damaged their relationship further. He was buried privately at midnight on 13 November in Westminster Abbey.

Anne refused initially to appoint a new Lord High Admiral, and insisted on carrying out the duties of the office herself, without appointing a member of the government to take George's place. She burst into tears on the first occasion she was brought papers to sign in George's stead. Undeterred, the Junto demanded the appointment of Lord Orford, a member of the Junto and one of Prince George's leading critics, as <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>. Admiral Churchill retired, and Anne appointed the moderate Tory <a href="Thomas%20Herbert%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">Lord Pembroke</a> to lead the Admiralty, instead of a Whig. The Junto Whigs Somers and Wharton, however, were appointed to the Cabinet in Pembroke's vacated posts of <a href="Lord%20President%20of%20the%20Council">Lord President of the Council</a> and <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland">Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</a>. The Whigs were still dissatisfied, and continued to pressure Pembroke and the Queen. Pembroke resigned after less than a year in office. Another month of arguments followed before the Queen finally consented to put Orford in control of the Admiralty as First Lord in November 1709.

<a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>, Anne's uncle, famously said of Prince George, "I have tried him drunk, and I have tried him sober and there is nothing in him". He was quiet and self-effacing. <a href="John%20Macky">John Macky</a> thought him "of a familiar, easy disposition with a good sound understanding but modest in showing it ... very fat, loves news, his bottle & the Queen." In making fun of George's asthma, <a href="John%20Sheffield%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Normanby">Lord Mulgrave</a> said the Prince was forced to breathe hard in case people mistook him for dead and buried him. By the time of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, George had a reputation as a dullard, and was the target of disdain. Victoria hoped her own husband, <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>, would never fill the "subordinate part played by the very stupid and insignificant husband of Queen Anne". In the 1930s, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> said he "mattered very little", except to Anne.

He had little impact on the running of the navy, but he was interested enough in navigation and welfare at sea to sponsor the publication of <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a>'s "Observations" in 1704. He was not one of the most colourful political characters of his day—he was content to spend his time building model ships—but he was a loyal and supportive husband to Queen Anne. Their marriage was a devoted, loving and faithful one, though beset by personal tragedy.

The previous husband of a British <a href="queen%20regnant">queen regnant</a>, William of Orange, had become king, refusing to take a subordinate rank to Mary. William and Mary had exemplified the traditional gender roles of seventeenth-century Europe: Mary was the dutiful wife and William held the power. George and Anne, however, reversed the roles: George was the dutiful husband and it was Anne who exercised the royal prerogatives. William had assumed incorrectly that George would use his marriage to Anne as a means of building a separate power base in Britain, but George never challenged his wife's authority and never strove to accrue influence. Anne occasionally used the image of wifely virtue to escape unpalatable situations by claiming, as a woman, she knew "nothing except what the prince tells me", but it was an artifice. Husbands had a legal right to their wife's property, and it was argued that it was unnatural and against the church's teachings for a man to be subject to his wife. George made no such claim or demand; he was content to remain a prince and duke. "I am her Majesty's subject", he said, "I shall do naught but what she commands me." In the words of historian <a href="Anne%20Somerset%20%28historian%29">Anne Somerset</a>, "the fact that Prince George was widely regarded as a nonentity helped reconcile people to his anomalous status, and so, almost by accident, George achieved a major advance for feminism." Winston Churchill wrote that he

was a fine-looking man, tall, blond, and good-natured ... He was neither clever nor learned—a simple, normal man without envy or ambition, and disposed by remarkable appetite and thirst for all the pleasures of the table. Charles's well-known verdict ... does not do justice to the homely virtues and unfailing good-humour of his staid and trustworthy character.

The <a href="Prince%20of%20Denmark%27s%20March">Prince of Denmark's March</a> by <a href="Jeremiah%20Clarke">Jeremiah Clarke</a> was written in his honour, and <a href="Prince%20George%27s%20County%2C%20Maryland">Prince George's County, Maryland</a>, was named after him in 1696.

European hare

The European hare ("Lepus europaeus"), also known as the brown hare, is a species of <a href="hare">hare</a> native to <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and parts of Asia. It is among the largest hare species and is adapted to temperate, open country. Hares are <a href="herbivorous">herbivorous</a> and feed mainly on grasses and herbs, supplementing these with twigs, buds, bark and field crops, particularly in winter. Their natural <a href="Predation">predators</a> include large <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, <a href="canidae">canid</a>s and <a href="felid">felid</a>s. They rely on high-speed endurance running to escape predation, having long, powerful limbs and large nostrils.

Generally nocturnal and shy in nature, hares change their behaviour in the spring, when they can be seen in broad daylight chasing one another around in fields. During this spring frenzy, they sometimes strike one another with their paws ("boxing"). This is usually not competition between males, but a female hitting a male, either to show she is not yet ready to mate or as a test of his determination. The female nests in a depression on the surface of the ground rather than in a burrow, and the young are active as soon as they are born. Litters may consist of three or four young and a female can bear three litters a year, with hares living for up to twelve years. The breeding season lasts from January to August.

The European hare is listed as being of <a href="Least-concern%20species">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> because it has a wide range and is moderately abundant. However, populations have been declining in mainland Europe since the 1960s, at least partly due to changes in farming practices. The hare has been hunted across Europe for centuries, with more than five million being shot each year; in Britain, it has traditionally been hunted by <a href="beagling">beagling</a> and <a href="hare%20coursing">hare coursing</a>, but these <a href="field%20sports">field sports</a> are now illegal. The hare has been a traditional symbol of <a href="fertility">fertility</a> and reproduction in some cultures, and its courtship behaviour in the spring inspired the English idiom "<a href="mad%20as%20a%20March%20hare">mad as a March hare</a>".

The European hare was first <a href="Species%20description">described</a> in 1778 by German zoologist <a href="Peter%20Simon%20Pallas">Peter Simon Pallas</a>. It shares the genus "<a href="Lepus">Lepus</a>" (<a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "hare") with 31 other hare and jackrabbit species, jackrabbits being the name given to some species of hare native to North America. They are distinguished from other <a href="leporid">leporid</a>s (hares and rabbits) by their longer legs, wider nostrils and active (<a href="precocial">precocial</a>) young. The <a href="Corsican%20hare">Corsican hare</a>, <a href="broom%20hare">broom hare</a> and <a href="Granada%20hare">Granada hare</a> were at one time considered to be <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the European hare, but <a href="DNA%20sequencing">DNA sequencing</a> and <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> analysis support their status as separate species.

There is some debate as to whether the European hare and the <a href="Cape%20hare">Cape hare</a> are the same species. A 2005 <a href="nuclear%20gene">nuclear gene</a> pool study suggested that they are, but a 2006 study of the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> of these same animals concluded that they had <a href="Genetic%20divergence">diverged</a> sufficiently widely to be considered separate species. A 2008 study claims that in the case of "Lepus" species, with their rapid evolution, species designation cannot be based solely on mtDNA but should also include an examination of the nuclear gene pool. It is possible that the genetic differences between the European and Cape hare are due to geographic separation rather than actual divergence. It has been speculated that in the Near East, hare populations are intergrading and experiencing <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a>. Another 2008 study suggests that more research is needed before a conclusion is reached as to whether a <a href="species%20complex">species complex</a> exists; the European hare remains classified as a single species until further data contradicts this assumption.

<a href="Cladogenesis">Cladogenetic</a> analysis suggests that European hares survived the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a> during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> via <a href="Refugium%20%28population%20biology%29">refugia</a> in southern Europe (<a href="Italian%20peninsula">Italian peninsula</a> and <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>) and <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>. Subsequent colonisations of Central Europe appear to have been initiated by human-caused environmental changes. Genetic diversity in current populations is high with no signs of <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a>. Gene flow appears to be biased towards males, but overall populations are <a href="matrilineally">matrilineally</a> structured. There appears to be a particularly large degree of genetic diversity in hares in the <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a> region of Germany. It is however possible that restricted gene flow could reduce genetic diversity within populations that become isolated.

Historically, up to 30 subspecies of European hare have been described, although their status has been disputed. These subspecies have been distinguished by differences in pelage colouration, body size, external body measurements, skull morphology and tooth shape.

Sixteen subspecies are listed in the IUCN red book, following Hoffmann and Smith (2005): 
Twenty-nine subspecies of "very variable status" are listed by Chapman and Flux in their book on lagomorphs, including the subspecies above (with the exceptions of "L. e. connori", "L. e. creticus", "L. e. cyprius", "L. e. judeae", "L. e. rhodius", and "L. e. syriacus") and additionally:
The European hare, like other members of the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Leporidae">Leporidae</a>, is a fast-running terrestrial mammal; it has eyes set high on the sides of its head, long ears and a flexible neck. Its teeth grow continuously, the first <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s being modified for gnawing while the second incisors are peg-like and non-functional. There is a gap (<a href="diastema">diastema</a>) between the incisors and the cheek teeth, the latter being adapted for grinding coarse plant material. The dental formula is 2/1, 0/0, 3/2, 3/3. The dark limb musculature of hares is adapted for high-speed endurance running in open country. By contrast, <a href="cottontail%20rabbit">cottontail rabbit</a>s are built for short bursts of speed in more vegetated habitats. Other adaptions for high speed running in hares include wider nostrils and larger hearts. In comparison to the <a href="European%20rabbit">European rabbit</a>, the hare has a proportionally smaller stomach and <a href="caecum">caecum</a>.

This hare is one of the largest of the <a href="Lagomorpha">lagomorphs</a>. Its head and body length can range from with a tail length of . The body mass is typically between . The hare's elongated ears range from from the notch to tip. It also has long hind feet that have a length of between . The skull has nasal bones that are short, but broad and heavy. The <a href="supraorbital%20ridge">supraorbital ridge</a> has well-developed anterior and posterior lobes and the <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a> projects prominently from the anterior wall of the orbit.

The fur colour is grizzled yellow-brown on the back; <a href="rufous">rufous</a> on the shoulders, legs, neck and throat; white on the underside and black on the tail and ear tips. The fur on the back is typically longer and more curled than on the rest of the body. The European hare's fur does not turn completely white in the winter as is the case with some other members of the genus, although the sides of the head and base of the ears do develop white areas and the hip and rump region may gain some grey.

European hares are native to much of <a href="continental%20Europe">continental Europe</a> and part of Asia. Their range extends from northern Spain to southern Scandinavia, eastern Europe, and northern parts of <a href="Western%20Asia">Western</a> and <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>. They have been extending their range into <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. They may have been introduced to Britain by the <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a>s (circa 2000 years ago) as there are no records of them from earlier sites. Undocumented introductions probably occurred in some Mediterranean Islands. They have also been introduced, mostly as <a href="Game%20%28food%29">game animals</a>, to North America (in <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> and <a href="New%20York%20State">New York State</a>, and unsuccessfully in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>), South America (<a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a> and the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>), <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, both islands of <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and the south Pacific coast of Russia.

Hares primarily live in open fields with scattered brush for shelter. They are very adaptable and thrive in mixed farmland. According to a study done in the Czech Republic, the mean hare densities were highest at altitudes below , 40 to 60 days of annual snow cover, of annual precipitation, and a mean annual air temperature of around . With regards to climate, the study found that hare densities were highest in "warm and dry districts with mild winters". In Poland, hares are most abundant in areas with few forest edges, perhaps because foxes can use these for cover. They require cover, such as hedges, ditches and permanent cover areas, because these habitats supply the varied diet they require, and are found at lower densities in large open fields. Intensive cultivation of the land results in greater mortality of young hares (leverets).

In the United Kingdom, hares are seen most frequently on arable farms, especially those with <a href="Crop%20rotation">fallow land</a>, <a href="wheat">wheat</a> and <a href="sugar%20beet">sugar beet</a> crops. In mainly grass farms their numbers are raised when there are improved pastures, some arable crops and patches of woodland. They are seen less frequently where <a href="fox">fox</a>es are abundant or where there are many <a href="Common%20buzzard">buzzards</a>. They also seem to be fewer in number in areas with high European rabbit populations, although there appears to be little interaction between the two species and no aggression. Although hares are shot as game when they are plentiful, this is a self-limiting activity and is less likely to occur in localities where they are scarce.

Hares are primarily <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> and spend a third of their time <a href="foraging">foraging</a>. During daytime, a hare hides in a depression in the ground called a "form" where it is partially hidden. Hares can run at and when confronted by predators they rely on outrunning them in the open. They are generally thought of as asocial but can be seen in both large and small groups. They do not appear to be <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a>, living in shared <a href="home%20range">home range</a>s of around . Hares communicate with each other by a variety of visual signals. To show interest they raise their ears, while lowering the ears warns others to keep away. When challenging a <a href="Conspecificity">conspecific</a>, a hare thumps its front feet; the hind feet are used to warn others of a predator. A hare squeals when hurt or scared and a female makes "guttural" calls to attract her young. Hares can live for as long as twelve years.

European hares are primarily <a href="herbivorous">herbivorous</a>. They may forage for wild grasses and weeds but with the intensification of agriculture, they have taken to feeding on crops when preferred foods are not available. During the spring and summer, they feed on <a href="soy">soy</a>, <a href="clover">clover</a> and <a href="corn%20poppy">corn poppy</a> as well as grasses and herbs. During autumn and winter, they primarily choose <a href="winter%20wheat">winter wheat</a>, and are also attracted to piles of sugar beet and carrots provided for them by hunters. They also eat twigs, buds and the bark of shrubs and young fruit trees during winter. <a href="Cereal">Cereal</a> crops are usually avoided when other more attractive foods are available, the species appearing to prefer high energy foodstuffs over crude <a href="Dietary%20fiber">fibre</a>. When eating twigs, hares strip off the bark to access the vascular tissues which store soluble <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s. Compared to the European rabbit, food passes through the gut more rapidly in the hare, although digestion rates are similar. They sometimes <a href="Coprophagia">eat their own green, faecal pellets</a> to recover undigested proteins and vitamins. Two to three adult hares can eat more food than a single <a href="sheep">sheep</a>.

European hares forage in groups. Group feeding is beneficial as individuals can spend more time feeding knowing that other hares are being vigilant. Nevertheless, the distribution of food affects these benefits. When food is well-spaced, all hares are able to access it. When food is clumped together, only dominant hares can access it. In small gatherings, dominants are more successful in defending food, but as more individuals join in, they must spend more time driving off others. The larger the group, the less time dominant individuals have in which to eat. Meanwhile, the subordinates can access the food while the dominants are distracted. As such, when in groups, all individuals fare worse when food is clumped as opposed to when it is widely spaced.

European hares have a prolonged breeding season which lasts from January to August. Females, or does, can be found pregnant in all breeding months and males, or bucks, are fertile all year round except during October and November. After this hiatus, the size and activity of the males' testes increase, signalling the start of a new reproductive cycle. This continues through December, January and February when the reproductive tract gains back its functionality. Matings start before <a href="ovulation">ovulation</a> occurs and the first pregnancies of the year often result in a single <a href="foetus">foetus</a>, with pregnancy failures being common. Peak reproductive activity occurs in March and April, when all females may be pregnant, the majority with three or more foetuses.

The mating system of the hare has been described as both <a href="Polygyny%20in%20animals">polygynous</a> (single males mating with multiple females) and <a href="Promiscuity">promiscuous</a>. Females have six-weekly reproductive cycles and are receptive for only a few hours at a time, making competition among local bucks intense. At the height of the breeding season, this phenomenon is known as "March madness", when the normally nocturnal bucks are forced to be active in the daytime. In addition to dominant animals subduing subordinates, the female fights off her numerous suitors if she is not ready to mate. Fights can be vicious and can leave numerous scars on the ears. In these encounters, hares stand upright and attack each other with their paws, a practice known as "boxing", and this activity is usually between a female and a male and not between competing males as was previously believed. When a doe is ready to mate, she runs across the countryside, starting a chase that tests the stamina of the following males. When only the fittest male remains, the female stops and allows him to copulate. Female fertility continues through May, June and July, but <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a> production decreases in males and sexual behaviour becomes less overt. Litter sizes decrease as the breeding season draws to a close with no pregnancies occurring after August. The testes of males begin to regress and sperm production ends in September.

Does give birth in hollow depressions in the ground. An individual female may have three litters in a year with a 41- to 42-day gestation period. The young have an average weigh of around at birth. The leverets are fully furred and are precocial, being ready to leave the nest soon after they are born, an adaptation to the lack of physical protection relative to that afforded by a burrow. Leverets disperse during the day and come together in the evening close to where they were born. Their mother visits them for nursing soon after sunset; the young suckle for around five minutes, urinating while they do so, with the doe licking up the fluid. She then leaps away so as not to leave an olfactory trail, and the leverets disperse once more. Young can eat solid food after two weeks and are weaned when they are four weeks old. While young of either sex commonly explore their surroundings, <a href="Biological%20dispersal">natal dispersal</a> tends to be greater in males. Sexual maturity occurs at seven or eight months for females and six months for males.

European hares are large leporids and adults can only be tackled by large predators such as <a href="Canidae">canids</a>, <a href="Felidae">felids</a> and the largest <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>. In Poland it was found that the consumption of hares by foxes was at its highest during spring, when the availability of small animal prey was low; at this time of year, hares may constitute up to 50% of the biomass eaten by foxes, with 50% of the mortality of adult hares being caused by their predation. In Scandinavia, a natural <a href="epizootic">epizootic</a> of <a href="Mange%23Sarcoptic%20mange">sarcoptic mange</a> which reduced the population of red foxes dramatically, resulted in an increase in the number of European hares, which returned to previous levels when the numbers of foxes subsequently increased. The <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a> preys on the European hare in the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>, the <a href="Carpathian%20Mountains">Carpathians</a>, the <a href="Apennine%20Mountains">Apennines</a> and northern Spain. In North America, foxes and <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s are probably the most common predators, with <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s and <a href="lynx">lynx</a> also preying on them in more remote locations.

European hares have both external and internal parasites. One study found that 54% of animals in Slovakia were parasitised by <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s and over 90% by <a href="coccidia">coccidia</a>. In Australia, European hares were reported as being infected by four species of nematode, six of coccidian, several <a href="liver%20fluke">liver fluke</a>s and two canine <a href="Cestoda">tapeworms</a>. They were also found to host <a href="Spilopsyllus%20cuniculi">rabbit fleas</a> ("Spilopsyllus cuniculi"), <a href="Echidnophaga%20gallinacea">stickfast fleas</a> ("Echidnophaga myrmecobii"), lice ("<a href="Haemodipsus%20setoni">Haemodipsus setoni</a>" and "<a href="Haemodipsus%20lyriocephalus">H. lyriocephalus</a>"), and mites ("<a href="Leporacarus%20gibbus">Leporacarus gibbus</a>").

European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) is a disease caused by a <a href="Caliciviridae">calicivirus</a> similar to that causing <a href="rabbit%20haemorrhagic%20disease">rabbit haemorrhagic disease</a> (RHS) and can similarly be fatal, but cross infection between the two mammal species does not occur. Other threats to the hare are <a href="pasteurellosis">pasteurellosis</a>, <a href="yersiniosis">yersiniosis</a> (pseudo-tuberculosis), <a href="coccidiosis">coccidiosis</a> and <a href="tularaemia">tularaemia</a>, which are the principal sources of mortality.

In October 2018, it was reported that a mutated form of the <a href="myxomatosis">myxomatosis</a> virus may have jumped to hares in the UK. Normally rare in hares, a significant die-off from the virus has also occurred in Spain.

In Europe, the hare has been a symbol of sex and fertility since at least <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a>. The Greeks associated it with the gods <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> and <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> as well as with <a href="satyr">satyr</a>s and <a href="cupid">cupid</a>s. The Christian Church connected the hare with lustfulness and homosexuality, but also associated it with the persecution of the church because of the way it was commonly hunted.

In Northern Europe, <a href="Easter">Easter</a> imagery often involves <a href="Easter%20Bunny">hares or rabbits</a>. Citing folk <a href="Easter%20customs">Easter customs</a> in <a href="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a>, England, where "the profits of the land called Harecrop Leys were applied to providing a meal which was thrown on the ground at the 'Hare-pie Bank'", the 19th-century scholar <a href="Charles%20Isaac%20Elton">Charles Isaac Elton</a> proposed a possible connection between these customs and the worship of <a href="%C4%92ostre">Ēostre</a>. In his 19th-century study of the hare in folk custom and mythology, <a href="Charles%20J.%20Billson">Charles J. Billson</a> cites folk customs involving the hare around Easter in Northern Europe, and argues that the hare was probably a sacred animal in prehistoric Britain's festival of springtime. Observation of the hare's springtime mating behaviour led to the popular English idiom "<a href="mad%20as%20a%20March%20hare">mad as a March hare</a>", with similar phrases from the sixteenth century writings of <a href="John%20Skelton">John Skelton</a> and <a href="Thomas%20More">Sir Thomas More</a> onwards. The mad hare reappears in "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>" by <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>, in which Alice participates in a crazy tea party with the <a href="March%20Hare">March Hare</a> and the <a href="The%20Hatter">Mad Hatter</a>.

Any connection of the hare to Ēostre is doubtful. John Andrew Boyle cites an etymology dictionary by A. Ernout and A. Meillet, who wrote that the lights of Ēostre were carried by hares, that Ēostre represented spring <a href="fecundity">fecundity</a>, love and sexual pleasure. Boyle responds that almost nothing is known about Ēostre, and that the authors had seemingly accepted the identification of Ēostre with the Norse goddess <a href="Freyja">Freyja</a>, but that the hare is not associated with Freyja either. Boyle adds that "when the authors speak of the hare as the 'companion of Aphrodite and of satyrs and cupids' and 'in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> [the hare] appears beside the figure of [mythological] Luxuria', they are on much surer ground."

The hare is a character in some fables, such as "<a href="The%20Tortoise%20and%20the%20Hare">The Tortoise and the Hare</a>" of <a href="Aesop">Aesop</a>. The story was annexed to a philosophical problem by <a href="Zeno%20of%20Elea">Zeno of Elea</a>, who created <a href="Zeno%27s%20paradoxes">a set of paradoxes</a> to support <a href="Parmenides">Parmenides</a>' attack on the idea of continuous motion, as each time the hare (or the hero <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>) moves to where the tortoise was, the tortoise moves just a little further away.
The German <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> artist <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> realistically depicted a hare in his 1502 watercolour painting "<a href="Young%20Hare">Young Hare</a>".

Across Europe, over five million European hares are shot each year, making it probably the most important game mammal on the continent. This popularity has threatened regional varieties such as those of France and Denmark, through large-scale importing of hares from Eastern European countries such as Hungary. Hares have traditionally been hunted in Britain by <a href="beagling">beagling</a> and <a href="hare%20coursing">hare coursing</a>. In beagling, the hare is hunted with a pack of small hunting dogs, <a href="beagle">beagle</a>s, followed by the human hunters on foot. In Britain, the <a href="2004%20Hunting%20Act">2004 Hunting Act</a> banned hunting of hares with dogs, so the 60 beagle packs now use artificial "trails", or may legally continue to hunt <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s. Hare coursing with <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a>s was once an <a href="aristocracy">aristocratic</a> pursuit, forbidden to lower <a href="social%20class">social class</a>es. More recently, informal hare coursing became a lower class activity and was conducted without the landowner's permission; it is also now illegal.

Hare is traditionally cooked by <a href="jugging">jugging</a>: a whole hare is cut into pieces, marinated and cooked slowly with red wine and <a href="juniper%20berries">juniper berries</a> in a tall jug that stands in a pan of water. It is traditionally served with (or briefly cooked with) the hare's blood and <a href="port%20wine">port wine</a>. Hare can also be cooked in a casserole. The meat is darker and more strongly flavoured than that of rabbits. Young hares can be roasted; the meat of older hares becomes too tough for roasting, and may be <a href="slow%20cooking">slow-cooked</a>.

The European hare has a wide range across Europe and western Asia and has been introduced to a number of other countries around the globe, often as a game species. In general it is considered moderately abundant in its native range, but declines in populations have been noted in many areas since the 1960s. These have been associated with the intensification of agricultural practices. The hare is an adaptable species and can move into new habitats, but it thrives best when there is an availability of a wide variety of weeds and other herbs to supplement its main diet of grasses. The hare is considered a pest in some areas; it is more likely to damage crops and young trees in winter when there are not enough alternative foodstuffs available.

The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> has evaluated the European hare's conservation status as being of <a href="Least-concern%20species">least concern</a>. However, at low population densities, hares are vulnerable to <a href="local%20extinction">local extinction</a>s as the available <a href="gene%20pool">gene pool</a> declines, making inbreeding more likely. This is the case in northern Spain and in Greece, where the restocking by hares brought from outside the region has been identified as a threat to regional gene pools. To counteract this, a <a href="captive%20breeding">captive breeding</a> program has been implemented in Spain, and the relocation of some individuals from one location to another has increased genetic variety. The <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20European%20Wildlife%20and%20Natural%20Habitats">Bern Convention</a> lists the hare under Appendix III as a protected species. Several countries, including Norway, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, have placed the species on their Red Lists as "near threatened" or "threatened".

Battle of Quebec (1775)

The Battle of Quebec () was fought on December 31, 1775, between American <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> forces and the British defenders of <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec City</a> early in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. The battle was the first major defeat of the war for the Americans, and it came with heavy losses. General <a href="Richard%20Montgomery">Richard Montgomery</a> was killed, <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> was wounded, and <a href="Daniel%20Morgan">Daniel Morgan</a> and more than 400 men were taken prisoner. The city's garrison, a motley assortment of regular troops and militia led by <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763%E2%80%931791%29">Quebec</a>'s provincial governor, General <a href="Guy%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dorchester">Guy Carleton</a>, suffered a small number of casualties.

Montgomery's army had captured Montreal on November 13, and early in December they joined a force led by Arnold, whose men had made an <a href="Arnold%27s%20expedition%20to%20Quebec">arduous trek</a> through the wilderness of northern <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. Governor Carleton had escaped from Montreal to Quebec, the Americans' next objective, and last-minute reinforcements arrived to bolster the city's limited defenses before the attacking force's arrival. Concerned that expiring enlistments would reduce his force, Montgomery made the end-of-year attack in a blinding snowstorm to conceal his army's movements. The plan was for separate forces led by Montgomery and Arnold to converge in the lower city before scaling the walls protecting the upper city. Montgomery's force turned back after he was killed by cannon fire early in the battle, but Arnold's force penetrated further into the lower city. Arnold was injured early in the attack, and Morgan led the assault in his place before he became trapped in the lower city and was forced to surrender. Arnold and the Americans maintained an ineffectual blockade of the city until spring, when British reinforcements arrived.

Shortly after the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> broke out in April 1775, a small enterprising force led by <a href="Ethan%20Allen">Ethan Allen</a> and <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> <a href="Capture%20of%20Fort%20Ticonderoga">captured</a> the key <a href="Fort%20Ticonderoga">Fort Ticonderoga</a> on May 10. Arnold followed up the capture with a raid on <a href="Fort%20Saint-Jean%20%28Quebec%29">Fort Saint-Jean</a> not far from <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, alarming the British leadership there.

These actions stimulated both British and rebel leaders to consider the possibility of an invasion of the <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763%E2%80%931791%29">Province of Quebec</a> by the rebellious forces of the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a>, and Quebec's governor, General <a href="Guy%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dorchester">Guy Carleton</a>, began mobilizing the provincial defenses. The British forces in Canada consisted of three regiments, with the 8th Regiment holding various forts around the Great Lakes and the 7th and 26th regiments guarding the St. Lawrence river valley. Apart from these regiments, the only forces available to the Crown were about 15,000 men of the militia and the 8,500 or so warriors from the various Indian tribes in the northern district of the Department of Indian Affairs. The largely "Canadien" militia and many of the Indian tribes were regarded as lukewarm in their loyalty to the Crown.

Both the Americans and the British misunderstood the nature of "Canadien" (as French Canadians were then known) society. The feudal nature of "Canadien" society with the "<a href="seigneur">seigneur</a>s" and the Catholic Church owning the land led the British to assume the "habitants" – as the tenant farmers who made up the vast majority of Quebec's population were known – would deferentially obey their social superiors while the Americans believed that the "habitants" would welcome them as liberators from their feudal society. In fact, the "habitants", despite being tenant farmers, tended to display many of the same traits displayed by the farmers in the 13 colonies who mostly owned their land, being described variously as individualistic, stubborn, and spirited together with a tendency to be rude and disrespectful of authority figures if their actions were seen as unjust. Most of the "habitants" wanted to be neutral in the struggle between Congress vs. the Crown, just wanting to live their lives in peace. Carleton's romanticized view of "Canadien" society led him to exaggerate the willingness of the "habitants" to obey the "seigneurs" as he failed to understand that the "habitants" would only fight for a cause that they saw as being in their own interests. A large number of the "Canadiens" still clung to the hope that one day Louis XVI would reclaim his kingdom's lost colony of New France, but until then, they wanted to be left alone.

The memory of <a href="Pontiac%27s%20War">Pontiac's War</a> in 1763 had made most of the Indians living in the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> valley, the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> valley distrustful of all whites, and most of the Indians in the region had no desire to fight for either Congress or the Crown. Only the Haudenosaunee, or <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a>, living in their homeland of Kaniekeh (modern upstate New York) were regarded as willing to fight for the Crown, and even then some of the Six Nations like the <a href="Oneida%20people">Oneida</a> and the <a href="Tuscarora%20people">Tuscarora</a> were already negotiating with the Americans. The Catholic Haudenosaunee living outside of Montreal—the so-called <a href="Seven%20Nations%20of%20Canada">Seven Nations of Canada</a>—were traditionally allies of the French and their loyalty to the British Crown was felt to be very shallow. Both Arnold and Allen argued to Congress that the British forces holding Canada were weak, that the "Canadiens" would welcome the Americans as liberators and an invasion would require only 2, 000 men. Taking Canada would eliminate any possibility of the British using it as a base to invade New England and New York.
After first rejecting the idea of an attack on Quebec, the Congress authorized the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>'s commander of its Northern Department, Major General <a href="Philip%20Schuyler">Philip Schuyler</a>, to invade the province if he felt it necessary. On 27 June 1775 approval for an invasion of Canada was given to Schuyler. As part of an American propaganda offensive, <a href="Letters%20to%20the%20inhabitants%20of%20Canada">letters from Congress</a> and the New York Provincial Assembly were circulated throughout the province, promising liberation from their oppressive government. Benedict Arnold, passed over for command of the expedition, convinced General <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> to authorize a second expedition through the wilderness of what is now the state of <a href="Maine">Maine</a> directly to <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec City</a>, capital of the province. The plan approved by Congress called for a two-pronged attack with 3,000 men under Schuyler going via <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a> and the <a href="Richelieu%20River">Richelieu River</a> valley to take <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> while 1,050 men under Arnold would march up the <a href="Kennebec%20River">Kennebec River</a> valley, over the Height of Land and then down the <a href="Chaudi%C3%A8re%20River">Chaudière River</a> valley to take Quebec City.

The Continental Army began <a href="Invasion%20of%20Canada%20%281775%29">moving into Quebec</a> in September 1775. <a href="Richard%20Montgomery">Richard Montgomery</a>, heading the American vanguard took <a href="Ile-aux-Noix">Ile-aux-Noix</a> on 2 September 1775. Its goal, as stated in a proclamation by General Schuyler, was to "drive away, if possible, the troops of Great Britain" that "under the orders of a despotic ministry ... aim to subject their fellow-citizens and brethren to the yoke of a hard slavery." On 16 September 1775, the sickly Schuyler handed over the command of his army to Montgomery. Brigadier General <a href="Richard%20Montgomery">Richard Montgomery</a> led the force from Ticonderoga and Crown Point up <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>, successfully <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20St.%20Jean">besieging Fort St. Jean</a>, and capturing Montreal on November 13. Arnold led a force of 1,100 men from <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a> on <a href="Arnold%27s%20expedition%20to%20Quebec">the expedition through Maine</a> towards Quebec shortly after Montgomery's departure from Ticonderoga.

One significant expectation of the American advance into Quebec was that the large French Catholic Canadien population of the province and city would rise against British rule. Since the British took control of the province, during the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> in 1760, there had been difficulties and disagreements between the local French Catholics and the Protestant English-speaking British military and civilian administrations. However, these tensions had been eased by the passage of the <a href="Quebec%20Act">Quebec Act</a> of 1774, which restored land and many civil rights to the Canadiens (an act which had been <a href="Intolerable%20Acts">condemned</a> by the thirteen rebelling colonies). The English-speaking "Old Subjects" living in Montreal and Quebec City (in contrast to the French-speaking "New Subjects") came mostly from Scotland or the 13 colonies, and they tried to dominate the Quebec colony both politically and economically, clashing with the long-established "Canadien" elite. James Murray, the first Governor of Quebec, had described the "Old Subject" businessmen who arrived in his colony as "adventurers of mean education...with their fortunes to make and little Sollicitous about the means". Carleton for his part felt the complaints by the "Canadiens" about the "Old Subjects" as greedy and unscrupulous businessmen were largely merited. As a member of Ireland's Protestant Ascendancy, Carleton found much to admire in Quebec which reminded him of his native Ireland, as both places were rural, deeply conservative Catholic societies. The majority of Quebec's French inhabitants chose not to play an active role in the American campaign, in large part because, encouraged by their clergy, they had come to accept British rule with its backing of the Catholic Church and preservation of French culture.

Many of the "Old Subjects" saw the Quebec Act as a betrayal by the Crown as it granted equality to the "Canadiens", most notably by allowing Roman Catholic men to vote and hold office, which ended the hopes of the "Old Subjects" to dominate Quebec politically. Ironically, many of the English-speaking and Protestant "Old Subjects" were the ones who served as "fifth column" for the Americans rather than the French-speaking Roman Catholic "New Subjects" as the many "Old Subject" businessmen had decided that an American victory was the their best hope of establishing Anglo-Protestant supremacy in Quebec. Prominent "Old Subject" businessmen such as Thomas Walker, James Price, William Heywood and Joseph Bindon in Montreal together with John McCord, Zachary Macaulay, Edward Antill, John Dyer Mercier and Udnay Hay in Quebec City all worked for an American victory by providing intelligence and later money for the Continental Army. Much of the American assessment that Canada could be easily taken was based on letters from "Old Subject" businessmen asking for the Americans to liberate them from the rule of the Crown which given had the "Canadiens" equality, and somewhat contradictory also claiming that the "Canadiens" would rise up against the British if the American entered Quebec.

General Carleton had begun preparing the province's defenses immediately on learning of Arnold's raid on St. Jean. On 9 June 1775 Carleton proclaimed martial law and called out the militia. At Montreal, Carleton found that there were six hundred men of the 7th Foot Regiment fit for duty, but he complained that there were no warships on the St. Lawrence, the forts around Montreal in a state of disrepair and through the "<a href="seigneury">seigneury</a>" and the Catholic Church were loyal to the Crown, most of the "habitants" appeared indifferent. Although Carleton concentrated most of his modest force at Fort St. Jean, he left small garrisons of British <a href="regular%20army">regular army</a> troops at Montreal and Quebec. To provide more manpower, Carleton raised the Royal Highland Emigrants Regiment, whom he recruited from the Scots immigrants in Quebec. The commander of the Royal Highland Emigrants, <a href="Allan%20Maclean%20of%20Torloisk">Allan Maclean</a>, was a Highlander who may or may not have fought for the Jacobites in the rebellion of 1745, but turned out to be Carleton's most aggressive subordinate in the campaign of 1775–76. On 26 July 1775, Carleton met Guy Johnson, the superintendent of the northern district of the Indian Department together with an Indian Department official, Daniel Claus, and a Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant. Johnson, Claus and Brant had brought with them some 1, 600 warriors whom they proposed to lead into a raid into New England, arguing that this was the best way of keeping the Americans engaged and out of Canada. Carleton declined the offer and ordered most of the Indians home, saying he did not want the Indians involved in this war, whom he regarded as savages who he believed would commit all sorts of atrocities against the white population of New England. Despite his dislike of Indians, whom he considered to be undisciplined and prone to brutality, Carleton employed them at least 50 Indians as scouts to monitor the American forces as no one else could operate in the wilderness as scouts as well as the Indians could.

Carleton followed the American invasion's progress, occasionally receiving intercepted communications between Montgomery and Arnold. Lieutenant Governor <a href="Hector%20Theophilus%20de%20Cramah%C3%A9">Hector Cramahé</a>, in charge of Quebec's defenses while Carleton was in Montreal, organized a militia force of several hundred to defend the town in September. He pessimistically thought they were "not much to be depended on", estimating that only half were reliable. Cramahé also made numerous requests for military reinforcements to the military leadership in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, but each of these came to nought. Several troop ships were blown off course and ended up in New York, and Vice Admiral <a href="Samuel%20Graves">Samuel Graves</a>, the commander of the fleet in Boston, refused to release ships to transport troops from there to Quebec because the approaching winter would close the <a href="Saint%20Lawrence%20River">Saint Lawrence River</a>. On 25 September 1775 an attempt by Ethan Allen to take Montreal in a surprise attack as the American sympathizer and prominent merchant Thomas Walker had promised he would open the city's gates was foiled. A mixed force of 34 men from the 26th Foot regiment, 120 "Canadien" volunteers and 80 "Old Subject" volunteers, 20 Indian Department employees and six Indians under the command of Major John Campbell stopped Allen's force on the outskirts of Montreal, killing 5 of the Americans and capturing 36. The victory caused 1, 200 "Canadiens" to finally respond to the militia summons, but Carleton, knowing only a large American force had entered Canada, chose to stay on the defensive under the grounds he was probably outnumbered. On 5 October, Carleton ordered Walker arrested on charges of high treason, which led to a shoot-out that left two soldiers wounded, Walker's house burned down, and Walker captured. On 15 October 1775, heavy guns arrived from Fort Ticonderoga, which finally allowed the American besiegers to start inflicting damage on Fort St. Jean and on 18 October, the fort at Chambly fell to the Americans.

The attempts of the Americans to recruit "Canadiens" (French-Canadians) for their cause were generally unsuccessful with Jeremy Duggan, an "Old Subject" Quebec City barber who had joined the Americans only recruiting 40 "Canadiens". The Roman Catholic clergy preached loyalty to the Crown, but the unwillingness of Carleton to take the offensive persuaded many "Canadiens" that the British cause was a lost one. Given the American numerical superiority, Carleton had decided to stay on the defensive, a decision which however justified under military grounds, proved to be politically damaging. On 2 November 1775, Montgomery took the Fort St. Jean, which the Americans had been besieging since September, causing Carleton to decide to pull back to Quebec City, which he knew that Arnold was also approaching. On 11 November, the British pulled out of Montreal and on 13 November 1775, the Americans took Montreal. Like Carleton, Montgomery was an Irishmen, and both generals had a certain understanding and respect for "Canadien" society, which was in many ways similar to Irish society, going out of their way to be tactful and polite in their dealings with "Canadiens". Montgomery insisted that his men display "brotherly affection" for the "Canadiens" at all times. However, the man that Montgomery placed in charge of Montreal, Brigadier General David Wooster, together with the newly freed Thomas Walker who served as Wooster's chief political adviser, displayed bigoted anti-Catholic and anti-French views, with Wooster shutting down all the "Mass houses" as he called Catholic churches just before Christmas Eve, a move that deeply offended the "Canadiens". The arbitrary and high-handed behavior of Wooster and Walker in Montreal together with their anti-Catholicism undercut their claims to be promoting "liberty" and did much to turn "Canadien" opinion against their self-proclaimed "liberators".

When definitive word reached Quebec on November 3 that Arnold's march had succeeded and that he was approaching the city, Cramahé began tightening the guard and had all boats removed from the south shore of the Saint Lawrence. Word of Arnold's approach resulted in further militia enlistments, increasing the ranks to 1,200 or more. Two ships arrived on November 3, followed by a third the next day, carrying militia volunteers from <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">St. John's Island</a> and <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland</a> that added about 120 men to the defense. A small convoy under the command of the frigate also arrived that day, from which a number of marines were added to the town's defenses.

On November 10, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Allan%20Maclean%20of%20Torloisk">Allen Maclean</a>, who had been involved in an attempt to lift the siege at St. Jean, arrived with 200 men of his <a href="84th%20Regiment%20of%20Foot%20%28Royal%20Highland%20Emigrants%29">Royal Highland Emigrants</a>. They had intercepted communications from Arnold to Montgomery near <a href="Trois-Rivi%C3%A8res">Trois-Rivières</a>, and hurried to Quebec to help with its defense. The arrival of this experienced force boosted the morale of the town militia, and Maclean immediately took charge of the defenses.

In the wake of the fall of Fort St. Jean, Carleton abandoned Montreal and returned to Quebec City by ship, narrowly escaping capture. Upon his arrival on November 19, he immediately took command. Three days later, he issued a proclamation that any able-bodied man in the town who did not take up arms would be assumed to be a rebel or a spy, and would be treated as such. Men not taking up arms were given four days to leave. As a result, about 500 inhabitants (including 200 British and 300 Canadians) joined the defense.

Carleton addressed the weak points of the town's defensive fortifications: he had two log barricades and <a href="palisade">palisade</a>s erected along the Saint Lawrence shoreline, within the area covered by his cannons; he assigned his forces to defensive positions along the walls and the inner defenses; and he made sure his inexperienced militia were under strong leadership.

The British believed that the forbidding landscape of upper Massachusetts (modern Maine) was impassable to a military force, but General Washington felt that the upper Massachusetts could be crossed in about 20 days. Arnold called for 200 bateaux (boats) and for "active woodsmen, well acquainted with bateaux". After recruiting 1,050 volunteers, Arnold departed for Quebec City on 5 September 1775. The men Arnold chose for his expedition were volunteers drawn from New England companies serving in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Boston">Siege of Boston</a>. They were formed into two battalions for the expedition; a third battalion was composed of riflemen from <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> under Captain <a href="Daniel%20Morgan">Daniel Morgan</a>'s command. After landing in Georgetown on 20 September, Arnold began his voyage up the Kennebec river. Arnold thought it was only 180 miles to Quebec City, but actually the distance was 300 miles and the terrain was far more difficult than he expected.

The trek through the wilderness of Maine was long and difficult with icy rains, dysentery caused by drinking unclean waters, and rivers full of drowned trees all presenting problems. The conditions were wet and cold, and the journey took much longer than either Arnold or Washington had expected. Bad weather and wrecked boats spoiled much of the expedition's food stores, and about 500 men of the original 1,100 turned back or died. Those who turned back, including one of the New England battalions, took many of the remaining provisions with them. The men who continued on were starving by the time they reached the first French settlements in early November. By the time they reached the Chaudière river, Arnold's men were eating their leather shoes and belts, and upon encountering the first "habitant" settlements on 2 November, they were overjoyed to be offered meals of beef, oatmeal and mutton, through they complained that the "Canadiens" charged too well for their food. On 3 November, the frigate HMS "Lizard" arrived in Quebec City with 100 men from Newfoundland. On 8 November, Arnold could see for the first time the <a href="Fortifications%20of%20Quebec">walls of Quebec City</a> towering over the St. Lawrence. On November 9, the 600 survivors of Arnold's march from Boston to Quebec arrived at <a href="L%C3%A9vis%2C%20Quebec">Point Levis</a>, on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence opposite Quebec City. Despite the condition of his troops, Arnold immediately began to gather boats to make a crossing. Arnold was prepared to do so on the night of November 10, but a storm delayed him for three days. An Indian chief greeted Arnold, and agreed to provide him with canoes to cross the St. Lawrence together with some 50 men to serve as guides. On 12 November, MacLean with his Highlanders arrived in Quebec City. Starting about 9 pm on 13 November, the Americans crossed the St. Lawrence in canoes to land at Wolfe's Cove, and by 4 am, about 500 men had crossed over. Once on the other side of the Saint Lawrence, Arnold moved his troops onto the <a href="Plains%20of%20Abraham">Plains of Abraham</a>, about 1.5 miles (2 km) from the city walls.

The troops approaching Quebec's walls were significantly under-equipped. Arnold had no artillery, each of his men carried only five <a href="cartridge%20%28firearms%29">cartridges</a>, more than 100 muskets were unserviceable, and the men's clothing had been reduced to rags. Despite being outnumbered two to one, Arnold demanded the city's surrender. Both envoys sent were shot at by British cannons, signifying that the demand had been rebuked. At a council of war called by Cramahé on 16 November, MacLean as the most senior military officer present advocated holding out. MacLean stated that Quebec City had a garrison of 1, 178 men and had enough food and firewood for both the garrison and the civilian population to last all through the winter. Arnold concluded that he could not take the city by force, so he blockaded the city on its west side. An inventory ordered by Arnold revealed that over 100 muskets had been so damaged by exposure to the elements during the trek through the wildness that they were now useless. On November 18, the Americans heard a (false) rumor that the British were planning to attack them with 800 men. At a council of war, they decided that the blockade could not be maintained, and Arnold began to move his men upriver to <a href="Neuville%2C%20Quebec">Pointe-aux-Trembles</a> ("Aspen Point") to wait for Montgomery, who had just taken Montreal. <a href="Henry%20Dearborn">Henry Dearborn</a>, who later became <a href="U.S.%20Secretary%20of%20War">U.S. Secretary of War</a> under President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, was present at the battle and wrote his famous journal, " The Quebec Expedition", which outlined the long and difficult march to the battle and the events that occurred there.

On December 1, Montgomery arrived at Pointe-aux-Trembles. His force consisted of 300 men from the <a href="1st%20New%20York%20Regiment">1st</a>, <a href="2nd%20New%20York%20Regiment">2nd</a>, and <a href="3rd%20New%20York%20Regiment">3rd</a> New York regiments, a company of artillery raised by <a href="John%20Lamb%20%28general%29">John Lamb</a>, about 200 men recruited by <a href="James%20Livingston%20%28American%20Revolution%29">James Livingston</a> for the <a href="1st%20Canadian%20Regiment">1st Canadian Regiment</a>, and another 160 men led by Jacob Brown who were remnants of regiments disbanded due to expiring enlistments. These were supplemented several days later by a few companies detached by Major General <a href="David%20Wooster">David Wooster</a>, whom Montgomery had left in command at Montreal. The artillery Montgomery brought included four cannons and six mortars, and he also brought winter clothing and other supplies for Arnold's men; the clothing and supplies were a prize taken when most of the British ships fleeing Montreal were captured. Arnold was unpopular with his men, and when Montgomery arrived, several of Arnold's captains asked that they be transferred over serving under Montgomery.

The commanders quickly turned towards Quebec, and put the city under siege on December 6. Montgomery sent a personal letter to Carleton demanding the city's surrender, employing a woman as the messenger. Carleton declined the request and burned the letter unread. Montgomery tried again ten days later, with the same result. The besiegers continued to send messages, primarily intended for the populace in the city, describing the situation there as hopeless, and suggesting that conditions would improve if they rose to assist the Americans. Carleton gave the command of his British Army soldiers, the Royal Marines and the Royal Highlanders to MacLean; the sailors to Captain John Hamilton of the Royal Navy; the English-speaking militiamen to Henry Caldwell and the "Canadien" militiamen to Noël Voyer. While the British began to fortify the Lower Town of Quebec City, Montgomery used his five mortars to begin bombarding Quebec City while American riflemen were assigned as snipers to gun down the soldiers patrolling the walls of Quebec City. Many of the enlistments of Montgomery's force expired on 31 December 1775, and despite his efforts to persuade his men to stay on, it was made clear by the Continental Army soldiers that they intended to go home once their enlistments ended. As December advanced, Montgomery was under increasing pressure to take Quebec City before 31 December.
On December 10, the Americans set up their largest battery of artillery from the walls. The frozen ground prevented the Americans from entrenching the artillery, so they fashioned a wall out of snow blocks. This battery was used to fire on the city, but the damage it did was of little consequence. Montgomery realized he was in a very difficult position, because the frozen ground prevented the digging of trenches, and his lack of heavy weapons made it impossible to breach the city's defenses. On 17 December, British cannons knocked out two of Montgomery's mortars, leading him to order the remaining three back. The enlistments of Arnold's men were expiring at the end of the year, and no ammunition was on the way from the colonies. Furthermore, it was very likely that British reinforcements would arrive in the spring, meaning he would either have to act or withdraw. Montgomery believed his only chance to take the city was during a snowstorm at night, when his men could scale the walls undetected. On Christmas Day, Montgomery announced in speech before his army his plans to take Quebec City.

While Montgomery planned the attack on the city, <a href="Christophe%20P%C3%A9lissier">Christophe Pélissier</a>, a Frenchman living near <a href="Trois-Rivi%C3%A8res">Trois-Rivières</a>, came to see him. Pélissier was a political supporter of the American cause who operated the <a href="Forges%20du%20Saint-Maurice">St. Maurice Ironworks</a>. He and Montgomery discussed the idea of holding a provincial convention to elect representatives to Congress. Pélissier recommended against this until after Quebec City had been taken, as the <a href="habitants">habitants</a> would not feel free to act in that way until their security was better assured. The two agreed that Pélissier's ironworks would provide munitions (ammunition, cannonballs, and the like) for the siege. This Pélissier did until the Americans retreated in May 1776, at which time he also fled, eventually returning to France.

A snowstorm arrived on the night of December 27, prompting Montgomery to prepare the troops for the attack. However, the storm subsided, and Montgomery called off the assault. That night, a sergeant from Rhode Island deserted, carrying the plan of attack to the British. Montgomery consequently drafted a new plan; this one called for two <a href="feint">feint</a>s against Quebec's western walls, to be led by Jacob Brown and James Livingston, while two attacks would be mounted against the lower town. Arnold would lead one attack to smash through the defenses at the north end of the Lower town through the Sault au Matelot and Montgomery would follow along the Saint Lawrence south of the Lower Town. The two forces would meet in the lower town and then launch a combined assault on the upper town by scaling its walls, believing that the "Old Subject" merchants living in the Upper Town would force Carleton to surrender upon the Upper Town was entered. Much of the hope behind Montgomery's plan was their either the "Old Subject" merchants would force Carleton to surrender once the Americans entered the city and/or the threat of having the warehouses destroyed would lead to the city's merchants likewise compelling Carleton to surrender. The new plan was revealed only to the senior officers. On the afternoon of 30 December 1775, a "northeaster" storm came from the Atlantic, bringing in a heavy snowfall, and Montgomery knowing that much of his army would be leaving in two days' time, ordered his men to form up for an assault on Quebec City.

A storm broke out on December 30, and Montgomery once again gave orders for the attack. Brown and Livingston led their militia companies to their assigned positions that night: Brown by the Cape Diamond <a href="redoubt">redoubt</a>, and Livingston outside St. John's Gate (). When Brown reached his position between 4 am and 5 am, he fired flares to signal the other forces, and his men and Livingston's began to fire on their respective targets. Montgomery and Arnold, seeing the flares, set off for the lower town.

Montgomery led his men from Wolfe's Cove down the steep, snow-heaped path towards the outer defenses. The storm had turned into a blizzard, making the advance a struggle. As they advanced over the ice-covered rocky ground, the bells of the <a href="Notre-Dame-des-Victoires%20Church">Notre-Dame-des-Victoires church</a> began to ring, as sentries manning the walls of Quebec City saw the American lanterns in the blizzard, and ringing the church bells was a signal to the militiamen to arm themselves. Montgomery's men eventually arrived at the palisade of the outer defenses, where an advance party of carpenters sawed their way through the wall. Montgomery himself helped saw through the second palisade, and led 50 men down a street towards a two-story building. The building formed part of the city's defenses, and was in fact a <a href="blockhouse">blockhouse</a> occupied by 39 Quebec militia and 9 sailors armed with muskets and cannons.

Montgomery unsheathed his sword as he led his men down the street as the blizzard raged. The defenders opened fire at close range, and Montgomery was killed instantly, shot through the head by a burst of <a href="grapeshot">grapeshot</a> while most of the men standing beside him were either killed or wounded. The few men of the advance party who survived fled back towards the palisade; only <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr</a> and a few others escaped unhurt. As the next two most senior officers, John Macpherson and Jacob Cheesemen, were also killed, command was assumed by the deputy quartermaster, Colonel Donald Campbell, who decided it was suicidal to try to advance again. Many of Montgomery's officers were injured in the attack; one of the few remaining uninjured officers led the survivors back to the Plains of Abraham, leaving Montgomery's body behind.

While Montgomery was making his advance, Arnold advanced with his main body towards the barricades of the Sault-au-Matelot at the northern end of the lower town. Leading Arnold's advance were 30 riflemen together with the artillerymen who attached a brass 6-pounder cannon to a sled. Behind them were the rest of the riflemen from Virginia and Pennsylvania, then the Continental Army volunteers from New England, and finally the rearguard consisted of those "Canadiens" and Indians from the Seven Nations of Canada who had decided to join the Americans.

They passed the outer gates and some British gun batteries undetected. However, as the advance party moved around the "Porte du Palais" (Palace Gate) (), heavy fire broke out from the city walls above them. The defenders opened fire with their muskets and hurled grenades down from the walls. The sled carrying the cannon was struck in a snowdrift in an attempt to avoid the hostile fire and was abandoned. The height of the walls made it impossible to return the defenders' fire, therefore Arnold ordered his men to run forward to the docks of Quebec City that were not behind the walls. In the process, the Americans became lost amid the unfamiliar streets of Quebec City and the raging blizzard.

They advanced down a narrow street, where they once again came under fire as they approached a barricade manned by 30 "Canadien" militiamen armed with three light cannons. Arnold had planned to use the cannon he brought with him, but since the gun was lost, he no choice but to order a frontal attack. As he was organizing his men in an attempt to take the barricade, Arnold received a deep wound in the leg from a musket ball that apparently ricocheted, and was carried to the rear after transferring command of his detachment to Daniel Morgan. Morgan, a tough Virginia frontiersman well respected by his men, personally led the assault, scaling a ladder up the barricade and was knocked down on his first attempt. On his second attempt, Morgan made to the top of the barricade, had to roll under one of the cannons to escape the bayonets of the defenders, but the rest of his men followed up. After a few minutes of fighting, the 30 militiamen surrendered while the Americans had lost 1 dead and six wounded.

Under Morgan's command, they captured the barricade, but had difficulty advancing further because of the narrow twisting streets and damp gunpowder, which prevented their muskets from firing. Moreover, despite Morgan's exhortations to advance, his men were afraid of being overpowered by their prisoners and wanted to wait for the rest of the Continental Army force to come up, leading to a 30-minute delay. Morgan and his men holed up in some buildings to dry out their powder and rearm, but they eventually came under increasing fire; Carleton had realized the attacks on the northern gates were feints and began concentrating his forces in the lower town.
Caldwell was speaking with Carleton when he learned of the assault on the "Porte du Palais", and took with him 30 Royal Highland Emigrants and 50 sailors as he headed out to stop the assault. At the second barricade, he found some 200 "Canadien" militiamen under Voyer and a company from the 7th Foot Regiment, who were confused about what was going on, whom he gave his orders to. Caldwell ordered the Royal Highlanders and the militia into the houses while ordering the British soldiers to form a double line behind 12 foot high barricade. As Morgan and his men advanced down the narrow streets of Quebec City, they were confronted by the sailors led by a man named Anderson who demanded their surrender. Morgan in reply shot Anderson dead while his sailors retreated; shouting "Quebec is ours!", Morgan then led a charge down the street. The Royal Highlanders and the militia opened fire from the windows in the houses. Despite the storm of bullets raining down on them, the Americans were able to place ladders against the barricades, but their attempts to scale it were all beaten back. An attempt to outflank the barricade by going through one of the houses led to a savage fight in the house with bayonet against bayonet, but was also repulsed. Under increasing heavy fire, Morgan ordered his men into the houses.

A British force of 500 sallied from the Palace Gate and reoccupied the first barricade, trapping Morgan and his men in the city. Captain George Laws led his 500 men, consisting of Royal Highlanders and sailors out of the Palace Gate, when they encountered an American force under Henry Dearborn who was coming up to aid Morgan. As Dearborn's men had their powder damp, they could not use their muskets and Dearborn and the rest of his men surrendered. Laws then turned against Morgan's group, who proved to be more stubborn. Laws himself was captured, but the attempts of the Americans to break out were blocked. As the fighting continued, the Americans ran out of ammunition and one by one, groups of Continental Army soldiers gave up the fight. With no avenue of retreat and under heavy fire, Morgan and his men surrendered. The battle was over by 10 am. Morgan was the last to surrender and rather than give up his sword to a British officer, he handed it to a Catholic priest who been sent under a flag of truce to ask for his surrender. Finally, Carleton ordered an assault on the battery outside the walls, which was captured, and afterwards the British withdrew back behind the safety of the walls. Found on the American corpses in the snow were paper streamers attached to their hats reading "Liberty or Death!".

This was the first defeat suffered by the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>. Carleton reported 30 Americans killed and 431 taken prisoner, including about two-thirds of Arnold's force. He also wrote that "many perished on the River" attempting to get away. Allan Maclean reported that 20 bodies were recovered in the spring thaw the following May. Arnold reported about 400 missing or captured, and his official report to Congress claimed 60 killed and 300 captured. British casualties were comparatively light. Carleton's initial report to General <a href="William%20Howe%2C%205th%20Viscount%20Howe">William Howe</a> mentioned only five killed or wounded, but other witness reports ranged as high as 50. Carleton's official report listed five killed and 14 wounded.

General Montgomery's body was recovered by the British on <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day">New Year's Day</a> 1776 and was given a simple military funeral on January 4, paid for by Lieutenant Governor Cramahé. The body was returned to New York in 1818. Together with the losses taken in the battle and the expiring enlistments left Arnold with only 600 men as 1 January 1776 to besiege Quebec City. Arnold asked for David Wooster, commanding the Continental Army force in Montreal to sent him some of his men, but Wooster refused, saying he was afraid of a pro-British uprising if he were to send away any of his forces. An appeal to help for Schuyler led to the reply that he could spare no men as the problem of expiring enlistments led him short of men, and moreover, Guy Johnson had succeeded in persuading some of the Mohawk to fight for the Crown. General Washington complained that the refusal of Congress to offer long-term enlistments or even bounties to those whose enlistments were about to expire was threatening to hobble the rebellion, and led him to consider resigning.

Arnold refused to retreat; despite being outnumbered three to one, the sub-freezing temperature of the winter and the mass departure of his men after their enlistments expired, he laid siege to Quebec. The siege had relatively little effect on the city, which Carleton claimed had enough supplies stockpiled to last until May. Immediately after the battle, Arnold sent <a href="Moses%20Hazen">Moses Hazen</a> and <a href="Edward%20Antill%20%28soldier%29">Edward Antill</a> to Montreal, where they informed General Wooster of the defeat. They then travelled on to Philadelphia to report the defeat to Congress and request support. (Both Hazen and Antill, English-speakers originally from the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> who had settled in Quebec, went on to serve in the Continental Army for the rest of the war.) In response to their report, Congress ordered reinforcements to be raised and sent north. During the winter months, small companies of men from hastily recruited regiments in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut made their way north to supplement the Continental garrisons at Quebec and Montreal. The journey to Quebec City in the winter left the reinforcements in poor health and many of their weapons unserviceable. Arnold used his remaining artillery to shell Quebec City, which caused some damage, but did little did to weaken Carleton's hold as Arnold only destroyed the homes of civilians. Carleton continued to build new blockhouses and trenches over the course of the winter and cut a trench in the frozen St. Lawrence to prevent an attempt to outflank the walls of Quebec City.

The presence of disease in the camp outside Quebec, especially <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, took a significant toll on the besiegers, as did a general lack of provisions. Smallpox ravaged Montgomery and Arnold's forces largely due to exposure to infected civilians released from Quebec. Governor Carleton condoned this practice, realizing it would severely weaken the American siege effort. Carleton is reported to have sent out several prostitutes infected with smallpox who in turn passed it on to the Continental Army. Arnold after using up all his gold could only pay for supplies with paper money, not coin, which proved to be problematic as the "habitants" wanted coins, and increasing the Americans had to take supplies at bayonet point. Together with the news of the anti-Catholic policies carried out by Wooster in Montreal, the requisitions of food and firewood made the besiegers more and more unpopular with the "habitants" who wanted the Americans to go home. In early April, Arnold was replaced by General Wooster, who was himself replaced in late April by General <a href="John%20Thomas%20%28general%29">John Thomas</a>.

Governor Carleton, despite appearing to have a significant advantage in manpower, chose not to attack the American camp, and remained within Quebec's walls. Montgomery, in analysing the situation before the battle, had observed that Carleton served under <a href="James%20Wolfe">James Wolfe</a> during the 1759 <a href="Siege%20of%20Quebec">Siege of Quebec</a>, and knew that the French General <a href="Louis-Joseph%20de%20Montcalm">Louis-Joseph de Montcalm</a> had paid a heavy price for leaving the city's defenses, ultimately losing the city and his life in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Plains%20of%20Abraham">Battle of the Plains of Abraham</a>. British General <a href="James%20Murray%20%28Quebec%20governor%29">James Murray</a> had also lost <a href="Battle%20of%20Sainte-Foy">a battle</a> outside the city in 1760; Montgomery judged that Carleton was unlikely to repeat their mistakes. On March 14, Jean-Baptiste Chasseur, a miller from the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence, reached Quebec City and informed Carleton there were 200 men on the south side of the river ready to act against the Americans. These men and more were mobilized to make an attack on an American gun battery at Point Levis, but an advance guard of this <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalist</a> militia was defeated in the March 1776 <a href="Battle%20of%20Saint-Pierre">Battle of Saint-Pierre</a> by a detachment of pro-American local militia. under Major Lewis Dubois On 2 April 1776, a new battery built by the Americans at Point Lévis started to shell Quebec City and ships in the St. Lawrence as the river thawed in the spring.

To rally support in Quebec, Congress sent a three-man commission consisting of Charles Carroll, Samuel Chase and Benjamin Franklin together with a pro-Patriot Catholic priest, Father John Carroll, and Fleury Mesplet, a French printer living in Philadelphia. On 29 April 1776, the commission arrived in Montreal and attempted to undo the damage done by Wooster, but found that public opinion had turned against them. Several "Canadien" leaders pointedly asked the commissioners that if the rebellion was justified because of "no taxation without representation", then why had Wooster imposed taxes on them in the name of Congress without their representation in Congress. Father Carroll talked extensively with his fellow Catholic priests in Quebec in a bid to win their support, but reported that the majority were satisfied with the Quebec Act, and were unwilling to support the rebellion. Through the Congressional commissioners rescinded Wooster's anti-Catholic decisions and allowed Catholic churches to re-open, by then the political damage could not be repaired.
When General Thomas arrived, the conditions in the camp led him to conclude that the siege was impossible to maintain, and he began preparing to retreat. On 3 May, the Americans sent a fireship down the St. Lawrence in an attempt to burn down the Queen's Wharf, but British artillery sank the fireship. The arrival on May 6 of a small British fleet carrying 200 regulars (the vanguard of a much larger invasion force), accelerated the American preparations to depart. Arriving in Quebec City were the frigates <a href="HMS%20Surprize%20%281746%29">HMS "Surprise"</a> and HMS "Isis" carrying the 29th Foot Regiment and Royal Marines. The retreat was turned into a near rout when Carleton marched these fresh forces, along with most of his existing garrison, out of the city to face the disorganized Americans. The American forces, ravaged by smallpox (which claimed General Thomas during the retreat), eventually retreated all the way back to Fort Ticonderoga. Carleton then launched a counteroffensive to regain the forts on Lake Champlain. Although he defeated the American fleet in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Valcour%20Island">Battle of Valcour Island</a> and regained control of the lake, the rear guard defense managed by Benedict Arnold prevented further action to capture Ticonderoga or Crown Point in 1776.

On May 22, even before the Americans had been completely driven from the province, Carleton ordered a survey to identify the Canadians who had helped the American expedition in and around Quebec City. <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Baby%20%28businessman%29">François Baby</a>, <a href="Gabriel-Elz%C3%A9ar%20Taschereau">Gabriel-Elzéar Taschereau</a>, and <a href="Jenkin%20Williams">Jenkin Williams</a> travelled the province and counted the Canadians who actively provided such help; they determined that 757 had done so. Carleton was somewhat lenient with minor offenders, and even freed a number of more serious offenders on the promise of good behaviour. However, once the Americans had been driven from the province, measures against supporters of the American cause became harsher, with a frequent punishment being forced labour to repair infrastructure destroyed by the Americans during their retreat. These measures had the effect of minimizing the public expression of support for the Americans for the rest of the war.

Between May 6 and June 1, 1776, nearly 40 British ships arrived at Quebec City. They carried more than 9,000 soldiers under the command of General <a href="John%20Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a>, including about 4,000 <a href="Germans%20in%20the%20American%20Revolution%23Allies%20of%20Great%20Britain">German auxiliaries</a> from <a href="Braunschweig">Brunswick</a> and <a href="Hesse-Hanau">Hesse-Hanau</a> (so-called <a href="Hessian%20%28soldier%29">Hessians</a>) under the command of Baron <a href="Friedrich%20Adolf%20Riedesel">Friedrich Adolf Riedesel</a>. These forces, some of which having participated in Carleton's counteroffensive, spent the winter of 1776–77 in the province, putting a significant strain on the population, which numbered only about 80,000. Carleton told the "habitants" that the quartering of the British and Brunswick troops was punishment for their "disloyalty" in not coming out in greater numbers when he summoned the militia. The Canadian historian Desmond Morton described Carleton as having "wisely" avoided battle outside of Quebec City in 1775-76, but overall his command in the campaign of 1775–76 was "lack-lustre", which led to John Burgoyne being given command of the invasion of New York in 1777. Many of these troops were deployed in 1777 for Burgoyne's <a href="Saratoga%20campaign">campaign for the Hudson Valley</a>.

Following the American victory at the battle of Saratoga, Congress once again considered invading Canada and in January 1778 voted for another invasion to be commanded by the Marquis de La Fayette. However, La Fayette found the necessary supplies and horses to support an invasion were lacking once he reached Albany and he advised cancelling the operation, advice that Congress accepted in March 1778. The news that the British had strengthened the forts on the border together with the walls of Montreal and of Quebec City meant that an invasion of Canada would require a substantial number of men and resources that were not available owing to operations elsewhere. Quebec City's status as one of the strongest fortified cities in North America meant it would require a massive amount of force to take. The idea of invading Canada continued to be debated in Congress up to 1780, but no decision was ever made. During the peace negotiations in Paris in 1782–83 for ending the American Revolutionary War, the American delegation asked for the cession of Canada (at the time, the term Canada applied only to what is now southern Quebec and southern Ontario) to the United States. As the Americans did not have possession of Canada at the time, the British refused and the American diplomats did not press the point. Had the Americans been victorious at the battle of Quebec, and were still in possession of Canada at the time of the peace negotiations, the American diplomats in Paris might have been more successful in demanding what is now southern Ontario and southern Quebec become part of the United States.

Three current United States <a href="Army%20National%20Guard">Army National Guard</a> units (Company A of the <a href="69th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28New%20York%29">69th Infantry Regiment</a>, the <a href="181st%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">181st Infantry Regiment</a>, and the <a href="182nd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">182nd Infantry</a>) trace their lineage to American units that participated in the Battle of Quebec.

History of biology

The history of biology traces the study of the <a href="life">living world</a> from <a href="ancient">ancient</a> to <a href="Modernity">modern</a> times. Although the concept of "<a href="biology">biology</a>" as a single coherent field arose in the 19th century, the biological sciences emerged from <a href="history%20of%20medicine">traditions of medicine</a> and <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a> reaching back to <a href="ayurveda">ayurveda</a>, <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20medicine">ancient Egyptian medicine</a> and the works of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and <a href="Galen">Galen</a> in the ancient <a href="Greco-Roman%20world">Greco-Roman world</a>. This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by <a href="Islamic%20medicine">Muslim physicians</a> and scholars such as <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a>. During the European <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and early modern period, biological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a> and the discovery of many novel organisms. Prominent in this movement were <a href="Vesalius">Vesalius</a> and <a href="William%20Harvey">Harvey</a>, who used experimentation and careful observation in physiology, and naturalists such as <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> and <a href="Georges-Louis%20Leclerc%2C%20Comte%20de%20Buffon">Buffon</a> who began to <a href="Scientific%20classification">classify the diversity of life</a> and the <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a>, as well as the development and behavior of organisms. <a href="Antonie%20van%20Leeuwenhoek">Antonie van Leeuwenhoek</a> revealed by means of <a href="microscopy">microscopy</a> the previously unknown world of microorganisms, laying the groundwork for <a href="cell%20theory">cell theory</a>. The growing importance of <a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a>, partly a response to the rise of <a href="mechanical%20philosophy">mechanical philosophy</a>, encouraged the growth of natural history (although it entrenched the <a href="teleological%20argument">argument from design</a>).

Over the 18th and 19th centuries, biological sciences such as <a href="botany">botany</a> and <a href="zoology">zoology</a> became increasingly professional <a href="scientific%20discipline">scientific discipline</a>s. <a href="Lavoisier">Lavoisier</a> and other physical scientists began to connect the animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a> investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography—laying the foundations for <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a>, <a href="ecology">ecology</a> and <a href="ethology">ethology</a>. Naturalists began to reject <a href="essentialism">essentialism</a> and consider the importance of <a href="extinction">extinction</a> and the <a href="history%20of%20evolutionary%20thought">mutability of species</a>. <a href="Cell%20theory">Cell theory</a> provided a new perspective on the fundamental basis of life. These developments, as well as the results from <a href="embryology">embryology</a> and <a href="paleontology">paleontology</a>, were synthesized in <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a> by <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of <a href="spontaneous%20generation">spontaneous generation</a> and the rise of the <a href="germ%20theory%20of%20disease">germ theory of disease</a>, though the mechanism of <a href="biological%20inheritance">inheritance</a> remained a mystery.

In the early 20th century, the rediscovery of <a href="Gregor%20Mendel">Mendel's</a> work led to the rapid development of <a href="genetics">genetics</a> by <a href="Thomas%20Hunt%20Morgan">Thomas Hunt Morgan</a> and his students, and by the 1930s the combination of <a href="population%20genetics">population genetics</a> and natural selection in the "<a href="Modern%20synthesis%20%2820th%20century%29">neo-Darwinian synthesis</a>". New disciplines developed rapidly, especially after <a href="James%20D.%20Watson">Watson</a> and <a href="Francis%20Crick">Crick</a> proposed the structure of <a href="DNA">DNA</a>. Following the establishment of the <a href="Central%20Dogma">Central Dogma</a> and the cracking of the <a href="genetic%20code">genetic code</a>, biology was largely split between "organismal biology"—the fields that deal with whole organisms and groups of organisms—and the fields related to "<a href="cell%20biology">cellular</a> and <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a>". By the late 20th century, new fields like <a href="genomics">genomics</a> and <a href="proteomics">proteomics</a> were reversing this trend, with organismal biologists using molecular techniques, and molecular and cell biologists investigating the interplay between genes and the environment, as well as the genetics of natural populations of organisms.

The word "biology" is formed by combining the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> <a href="wikt%3A%CE%B2%CE%AF%CE%BF%CF%82">βίος</a> (bios), meaning "life", and so the suffix '-logy', meaning "science of", "knowledge of", "study of", "about of", based on the Greek verb <a href="wikt%3A%CE%BB%CE%AD%CE%B3%CF%89">λέγειν</a>, 'legein' "to select", "to gather" (cf. the noun <a href="wikt%3A%CE%BB%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82">λόγος</a>, 'logos' "word"). The term "biology" in its modern sense appears to have been introduced independently by <a href="Thomas%20Beddoes">Thomas Beddoes</a> (in 1799), <a href="Karl%20Friedrich%20Burdach">Karl Friedrich Burdach</a> (in 1800), <a href="Gottfried%20Reinhold%20Treviranus">Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus</a> ("Biologie oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur", 1802) and <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a> ("Hydrogéologie", 1802). The word itself appears in the title of Volume 3 of <a href="Michael%20Christoph%20Hanow">Michael Christoph Hanow</a>'s "Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae dogmaticae: Geologia, biologia, phytologia generalis et dendrologia", published in 1766.

Before "biology", there were several terms used for the study of animals and plants. "<a href="Natural%20history">Natural history</a>" referred to the descriptive aspects of biology, though it also included <a href="mineralogy">mineralogy</a> and other non-biological fields; from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance, the unifying framework of natural history was the "scala naturae" or <a href="Great%20Chain%20of%20Being">Great Chain of Being</a>. "<a href="Natural%20philosophy">Natural philosophy</a>" and "<a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a>" encompassed the conceptual and metaphysical basis of plant and animal life, dealing with problems of why organisms exist and behave the way they do, though these subjects also included what is now <a href="geology">geology</a>, <a href="physics">physics</a>, <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, and <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>. Physiology and (botanical) pharmacology were the province of medicine. "Botany", "zoology", and (in the case of fossils) "geology" replaced "natural history" and "natural philosophy" in the 18th and 19th centuries before "biology" was widely adopted. To this day, "botany" and "zoology" are widely used, although they have been joined by other sub-disciplines of biology.

The <a href="earliest%20humans">earliest humans</a> must have had and passed on knowledge about <a href="plant">plant</a>s and <a href="animal">animal</a>s to increase their chances of survival. This may have included knowledge of human and animal anatomy and aspects of animal behavior (such as migration patterns). However, the first major turning point in biological knowledge came with the <a href="Neolithic%20Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a> about 10,000 years ago. Humans first domesticated plants for farming, then <a href="livestock">livestock</a> animals to accompany the resulting sedentary societies.

The ancient cultures of <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, the <a href="History%20of%20India">Indian subcontinent</a>, and <a href="History%20of%20China">China</a>, among others, produced renowned surgeons and students of the natural sciences such as <a href="Susruta">Susruta</a> and <a href="Zhang%20Zhongjing">Zhang Zhongjing</a>, reflecting independent sophisticated systems of natural philosophy. However, the roots of modern biology are usually traced back to the <a href="secular">secular</a> tradition of <a href="ancient%20Greek%20philosophy">ancient Greek philosophy</a>.

The Mesopotamians seem to have had little interest in the natural world as such, preferring to study how the gods had ordered the universe. <a href="Animal%20physiology">Animal physiology</a> was studied for <a href="divination">divination</a>, including especially the anatomy of the <a href="liver">liver</a>, seen as an important organ in <a href="haruspicy">haruspicy</a>. <a href="Animal%20behavior">Animal behavior</a> too was studied for divinatory purposes. Most information about the training and domestication of animals was probably transmitted orally, but one text dealing with the training of horses has survived.

The ancient Mesopotamians had no distinction between "rational science" and <a href="Magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a>. When a person became ill, doctors prescribed both magical formulas to be recited and medicinal treatments. The earliest medical prescriptions appear in <a href="Sumerian%20language">Sumerian</a> during the <a href="Third%20Dynasty%20of%20Ur">Third Dynasty of Ur</a> ( 2112 – 2004 BCE). The most extensive Babylonian medical text, however, is the "Diagnostic Handbook" written by the "ummânū", or chief scholar, <a href="Esagil-kin-apli">Esagil-kin-apli</a> of <a href="Borsippa">Borsippa</a>, during the reign of the Babylonian king <a href="Adad-apla-iddina">Adad-apla-iddina</a> (1069 – 1046 BCE). In <a href="East%20Semitic">East Semitic</a> cultures, the main medicinal authority was an exorcist-healer known as an "<a href="Asipu">āšipu</a>". The profession was passed down from father to son and was held in high regard. Of less frequent recourse was the "asu", a healer who treated physical symptoms using remedies composed of herbs, animal products, and minerals, as well as potions, enemas, and ointments or <a href="poultices">poultices</a>. These physicians, who could be either male or female, also dressed wounds, set limbs, and performed simple surgeries. The ancient Mesopotamians also practiced <a href="prophylaxis">prophylaxis</a> and took measures to prevent the spread of disease.

In ancient China, biological topics can be found dispersed across several different disciplines, including the work of <a href="Chinese%20herbology">herbologists</a>, physicians, alchemists, and <a href="Chinese%20philosophy">philosophers</a>. The <a href="Taoism">Taoist</a> tradition of <a href="Chinese%20alchemy">Chinese alchemy</a>, for example, can be considered part of the life sciences due to its emphasis on health (with the ultimate goal being the <a href="elixir%20of%20life">elixir of life</a>). The system of <a href="classical%20Chinese%20medicine">classical Chinese medicine</a> usually revolved around the theory of <a href="yin%20and%20yang">yin and yang</a>, and the <a href="Wu%20Xing">five phases</a>. Taoist philosophers, such as <a href="Zhuang%20Zhou">Zhuangzi</a> in the 4th century BCE, also expressed ideas related to <a href="evolution">evolution</a>, such as denying the fixity of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments.

One of the oldest organised systems of medicine is known from the Indian subcontinent in the form of <a href="Ayurveda">Ayurveda</a> which originated around 1500 BCE from <a href="Atharvaveda">Atharvaveda</a> (one of the four most ancient books of Indian knowledge, wisdom and culture).

The ancient Indian <a href="Ayurveda">Ayurveda</a> tradition independently developed the concept of three humours, resembling that of the <a href="Humorism">four humours</a> of <a href="ancient%20Greek%20medicine">ancient Greek medicine</a>, though the Ayurvedic system included further complications, such as the body being composed of <a href="Classical%20element">five elements</a> and seven basic <a href="Tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a>. Ayurvedic writers also classified living things into four categories based on the method of birth (from the womb, eggs, heat & moisture, and seeds) and explained the conception of a <a href="fetus">fetus</a> in detail. They also made considerable advances in the field of <a href="surgery">surgery</a>, often without the use of human <a href="dissection">dissection</a> or animal <a href="vivisection">vivisection</a>. One of the earliest Ayurvedic treatises was the "<a href="Sushruta%20Samhita">Sushruta Samhita</a>", attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BCE. It was also an early <a href="materia%20medica">materia medica</a>, describing 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources, and 57 preparations based on animal sources.

Over a dozen <a href="medical%20papyri">medical papyri</a> have been preserved, most notably the <a href="Edwin%20Smith%20Papyrus">Edwin Smith Papyrus</a> (the oldest extant surgical handbook) and the <a href="Ebers%20Papyrus">Ebers Papyrus</a> (a handbook of preparing and using materia medica for various diseases), both from the 16th century BCE.

Ancient Egypt is also known for developing <a href="embalming">embalming</a>, which was used for <a href="Mummy">mummification</a>, in order to preserve human remains and forestall <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a>.

The <a href="Pre-Socratic%20philosophy">pre-Socratic philosophers</a> asked many questions about life but produced little systematic knowledge of specifically biological interest—though the attempts of the <a href="atomists">atomists</a> to explain life in purely physical terms would recur periodically through the history of biology. However, the medical theories of <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> and his followers, especially <a href="humorism">humorism</a>, had a lasting impact.

The philosopher <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> was the most influential scholar of the living world from <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>. Though his early work in natural philosophy was speculative, <a href="Aristotle%27s%20biology">Aristotle's later biological writings</a> were more empirical, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and <a href="Abstraction">attributes</a> of <a href="plant">plant</a>s and <a href="animal">animal</a>s in the world around him, which he devoted considerable attention to <a href="categorization">categorizing</a>. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, <a href="formal%20cause">formal cause</a>s, guided all natural processes.

Aristotle, and nearly all Western scholars after him until the 18th century, believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to humans: the "scala naturae" or <a href="Great%20Chain%20of%20Being">Great Chain of Being</a>. Aristotle's successor at the <a href="Lyceum">Lyceum</a>, <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a>, wrote a series of books on botany—the "<a href="Historia%20Plantarum%20%28Theophrastus%29">History of Plants</a>"—which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as "carpos" for fruit, and "pericarpion" for seed vessel. <a href="Dioscorides">Dioscorides</a> wrote a pioneering and <a href="encyclopaedia">encyclopaedic</a> <a href="pharmacopoeia">pharmacopoeia</a>, "<a href="De%20Materia%20Medica%20%28Dioscorides%29">De Materia Medica</a>", incorporating descriptions of some 600 plants and their uses in <a href="Roman%20medicine">medicine</a>. <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, in his "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>", assembled a similarly encyclopaedic account of things in nature, including accounts of many plants and animals.

A few scholars in the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a> under the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemies</a>—particularly <a href="Herophilos">Herophilus of Chalcedon</a> and <a href="Erasistratus">Erasistratus of Chios</a>—amended Aristotle's physiological work, even performing dissections and vivisections. <a href="Galen">Claudius Galen</a> became the most important authority on medicine and anatomy. Though a few ancient <a href="atomism">atomists</a> such as <a href="Lucretius">Lucretius</a> challenged the <a href="teleology">teleological</a> Aristotelian viewpoint that all aspects of life are the result of design or purpose, teleology (and after the rise of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, <a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a>) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. <a href="Ernst%20W.%20Mayr">Ernst W. Mayr</a> argued that "Nothing of any real consequence happened in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance." The ideas of the Greek traditions of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly in <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval Europe</a>.

The decline of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> led to the disappearance or destruction of much knowledge, though physicians still incorporated many aspects of the Greek tradition into training and practice. In <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> and the <a href="Islamic">Islamic</a> world, many of the Greek works were translated into <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> and many of the works of Aristotle were preserved.

During the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a>, a few European scholars such as <a href="Hildegard%20of%20Bingen">Hildegard of Bingen</a>, <a href="Albertus%20Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a> and <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick II</a> wrote on natural history. The <a href="History%20of%20European%20research%20universities">rise of European universities</a>, though important for the development of physics and philosophy, had little impact on biological scholarship.

The <a href="European%20Renaissance">European Renaissance</a> brought expanded interest in both empirical natural history and physiology. In 1543, <a href="Andreas%20Vesalius">Andreas Vesalius</a> inaugurated the modern era of Western medicine with his seminal <a href="human%20anatomy">human anatomy</a> treatise "<a href="De%20humani%20corporis%20fabrica">De humani corporis fabrica</a>", which was based on dissection of corpses. Vesalius was the first in a series of anatomists who gradually replaced <a href="scholasticism">scholasticism</a> with <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a> in physiology and medicine, relying on first-hand experience rather than authority and abstract reasoning. Via <a href="herbalism">herbalism</a>, medicine was also indirectly the source of renewed empiricism in the study of plants. <a href="Otto%20Brunfels">Otto Brunfels</a>, <a href="Hieronymus%20Bock">Hieronymus Bock</a> and <a href="Leonhart%20Fuchs">Leonhart Fuchs</a> wrote extensively on wild plants, the beginning of a nature-based approach to the full range of plant life. <a href="Bestiaries">Bestiaries</a>—a genre that combines both the natural and figurative knowledge of animals—also became more sophisticated, especially with the work of <a href="William%20Turner%20%28naturalist%29">William Turner</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Belon">Pierre Belon</a>, <a href="Guillaume%20Rondelet">Guillaume Rondelet</a>, <a href="Conrad%20Gessner">Conrad Gessner</a>, and <a href="Ulisse%20Aldrovandi">Ulisse Aldrovandi</a>.

Artists such as <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> and <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, often working with naturalists, were also interested in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing to the growth of anatomical knowledge. The traditions of <a href="alchemy">alchemy</a> and <a href="natural%20magic">natural magic</a>, especially in the work of <a href="Paracelsus">Paracelsus</a>, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral <a href="pharmacology">pharmacology</a>. This was part of a larger transition in world views (the rise of the <a href="mechanical%20philosophy">mechanical philosophy</a>) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of "nature as organism" was replaced by the "nature as machine" metaphor.

<a href="Scientific%20classification">Systematizing</a>, naming and classifying dominated natural history throughout much of the 17th and 18th centuries. <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> published a basic <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">scientific names</a> for all his species. While Linnaeus conceived of species as unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy, the other great naturalist of the 18th century, <a href="Georges-Louis%20Leclerc%2C%20Comte%20de%20Buffon">Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon</a>, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of <a href="common%20descent">common descent</a>. Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the <a href="history%20of%20evolutionary%20thought">history of evolutionary thought</a>; his work would influence the evolutionary theories of both <a href="Lamarck">Lamarck</a> and <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Darwin</a>.

The discovery and description of new species and the <a href="collecting">collection</a> of specimens became a passion of scientific gentlemen and a lucrative enterprise for entrepreneurs; many naturalists traveled the globe in search of scientific knowledge and adventure.

Extending the work of Vesalius into experiments on still living bodies (of both humans and animals), <a href="William%20Harvey">William Harvey</a> and other natural philosophers investigated the roles of blood, veins and arteries. Harvey's "<a href="De%20motu%20cordis">De motu cordis</a>" in 1628 was the beginning of the end for Galenic theory, and alongside <a href="Santorio%20Santorio">Santorio Santorio</a>'s studies of metabolism, it served as an influential model of quantitative approaches to physiology.

In the early 17th century, the micro-world of biology was just beginning to open up. A few lensmakers and natural philosophers had been creating crude <a href="microscope">microscope</a>s since the late 16th century, and <a href="Robert%20Hooke">Robert Hooke</a> published the seminal "<a href="Micrographia">Micrographia</a>" based on observations with his own compound microscope in 1665. But it was not until <a href="Antonie%20van%20Leeuwenhoek">Antonie van Leeuwenhoek</a>'s dramatic improvements in lensmaking beginning in the 1670s—ultimately producing up to 200-fold magnification with a single lens—that scholars discovered <a href="spermatozoa">spermatozoa</a>, <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="infusoria">infusoria</a> and the sheer strangeness and diversity of microscopic life. Similar investigations by <a href="Jan%20Swammerdam">Jan Swammerdam</a> led to new interest in <a href="entomology">entomology</a> and built the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and <a href="staining">staining</a>.
As the microscopic world was expanding, the macroscopic world was shrinking. Botanists such as <a href="John%20Ray">John Ray</a> worked to incorporate the flood of newly discovered organisms shipped from across the globe into a coherent taxonomy, and a coherent theology (<a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a>). Debate over another flood, the <a href="Noachian%20flood">Noachian</a>, catalyzed the development of <a href="paleontology">paleontology</a>; in 1669 <a href="Nicholas%20Steno">Nicholas Steno</a> published an essay on how the remains of living organisms could be trapped in layers of sediment and mineralized to produce <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s. Although Steno's ideas about fossilization were well known and much debated among natural philosophers, an organic origin for all fossils would not be accepted by all naturalists until the end of the 18th century due to philosophical and theological debate about issues such as the age of the earth and <a href="extinction">extinction</a>.

Up through the 19th century, the scope of biology was largely divided between medicine, which investigated questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and between life and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart <a href="natural%20philosophy">natural philosophy</a>) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines—<a href="cell%20biology">cytology</a>, <a href="bacteriology">bacteriology</a>, <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, <a href="embryology">embryology</a>, <a href="geography">geography</a>, and <a href="geology">geology</a>.

Widespread travel by naturalists in the early-to-mid-19th century resulted in a wealth of new information about the diversity and distribution of living organisms. Of particular importance was the work of <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a>, which analyzed the relationship between organisms and their environment (i.e., the domain of <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a>) using the quantitative approaches of <a href="natural%20philosophy">natural philosophy</a> (i.e., <a href="physics">physics</a> and <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>). Humboldt's work laid the foundations of <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a> and inspired several generations of scientists.

The emerging discipline of geology also brought natural history and natural philosophy closer together; the establishment of the <a href="stratigraphy">stratigraphic column</a> linked the spatial distribution of organisms to their temporal distribution, a key precursor to concepts of evolution. <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> and others made great strides in <a href="comparative%20anatomy">comparative anatomy</a> and <a href="paleontology">paleontology</a> in the late 1790s and early 19th century. In a series of lectures and papers that made detailed comparisons between living mammals and <a href="fossil">fossil</a> remains Cuvier was able to establish that the fossils were remains of species that had become <a href="extinct">extinct</a>—rather than being remains of species still alive elsewhere in the world, as had been widely believed. Fossils discovered and described by <a href="Gideon%20Mantell">Gideon Mantell</a>, <a href="William%20Buckland">William Buckland</a>, <a href="Mary%20Anning">Mary Anning</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> among others helped establish that there had been an 'age of reptiles' that had preceded even the prehistoric mammals. These discoveries captured the public imagination and focused attention on the history of life on earth. Most of these geologists held to <a href="catastrophism">catastrophism</a>, but <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>'s influential "Principles of Geology" (1830) popularised <a href="James%20Hutton">Hutton's</a> <a href="uniformitarianism%20%28science%29">uniformitarianism</a>, a theory that explained the geological past and present on equal terms.

The most significant evolutionary theory before Darwin's was that of <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a>; based on the <a href="inheritance%20of%20acquired%20characteristics">inheritance of acquired characteristics</a> (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, <a href="Thomas%20Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a>'s writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>; similar evidence led <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> to independently reach the same conclusions.

The 1859 publication of Darwin's theory in "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species%20by%20Means%20of%20Natural%20Selection%2C%20or%20the%20Preservation%20of%20Favoured%20Races%20in%20the%20Struggle%20for%20Life">On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</a>" is often considered the central event in the history of modern biology. Darwin's established credibility as a naturalist, the sober tone of the work, and most of all the sheer strength and volume of evidence presented, allowed "Origin" to succeed where previous evolutionary works such as the anonymous "<a href="Vestiges%20of%20Creation">Vestiges of Creation</a>" had failed. Most scientists were convinced of evolution and <a href="common%20descent">common descent</a> by the end of the 19th century. However, natural selection would not be accepted as the primary mechanism of evolution until well into the 20th century, as most contemporary theories of heredity seemed incompatible with the inheritance of random variation.
Wallace, following on earlier work by <a href="A.P.%20de%20Candolle">de Candolle</a>, <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Humboldt</a> and Darwin, made major contributions to <a href="zoogeography">zoogeography</a>. Because of his interest in the transmutation hypothesis, he paid particular attention to the geographical distribution of closely allied species during his field work first in <a href="South%20America">South America</a> and then in the <a href="Malay%20archipelago">Malay archipelago</a>. While in the archipelago he identified the <a href="Wallace%20line">Wallace line</a>, which runs through the <a href="Maluku%20Islands">Spice Islands</a> dividing the fauna of the archipelago between an Asian zone and a <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>/Australian zone. His key question, as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates should be so different, could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote "The Geographical Distribution of Animals", which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, "Island Life", in 1880 that focused on island biogeography. He extended the six-zone system developed by <a href="Philip%20Sclater">Philip Sclater</a> for describing the geographical distribution of birds to animals of all kinds. His method of tabulating data on animal groups in geographic zones highlighted the discontinuities; and his appreciation of evolution allowed him to propose rational explanations, which had not been done before.

The scientific study of <a href="heredity">heredity</a> grew rapidly in the wake of Darwin's "Origin of Species" with the work of <a href="Francis%20Galton">Francis Galton</a> and the <a href="biometry">biometricians</a>. The origin of <a href="genetics">genetics</a> is usually traced to the 1866 work of the <a href="monk">monk</a> <a href="Gregor%20Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>, who would later be credited with the <a href="laws%20of%20inheritance">laws of inheritance</a>. However, his work was not recognized as significant until 35 years afterward. In the meantime, a variety of theories of inheritance (based on <a href="pangenesis">pangenesis</a>, <a href="orthogenesis">orthogenesis</a>, or other mechanisms) were debated and investigated vigorously. <a href="Embryology">Embryology</a> and <a href="ecology">ecology</a> also became central biological fields, especially as linked to evolution and popularized in the work of <a href="Ernst%20Haeckel">Ernst Haeckel</a>. Most of the 19th century work on heredity, however, was not in the realm of natural history, but that of <a href="experimental%20physiology">experimental physiology</a>.

Over the course of the 19th century, the scope of physiology expanded greatly, from a primarily medically oriented field to a wide-ranging investigation of the physical and chemical processes of life—including plants, animals, and even microorganisms in addition to man. "Living things as machines" became a dominant metaphor in biological (and social) thinking.

Advances in <a href="microscopy">microscopy</a> also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a>. In 1838 and 1839, <a href="Matthias%20Jakob%20Schleiden">Schleiden</a> and <a href="Theodor%20Schwann">Schwann</a> began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of <a href="life">life</a>, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of <a href="Robert%20Remak">Robert Remak</a> and <a href="Rudolf%20Virchow">Rudolf Virchow</a>, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as <a href="cell%20theory">cell theory</a>.

Cell theory led biologists to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages of individual cells. Scientists in the rising field of <a href="cell%20biology">cytology</a>, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new <a href="staining">staining</a> methods, soon found that even single cells were far more complex than the homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28Scottish%20botanist%20from%20Montrose%29">Robert Brown</a> had described the <a href="Cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a> in 1831, and by the end of the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s, <a href="centrosome">centrosome</a>s <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>, <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 <a href="Walther%20Flemming">Walther Flemming</a> described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not <a href="Artifact%20%28observational%29">artifacts</a> of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in <a href="August%20Weismann">August Weismann</a>'s theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between <a href="somatic%20cell">somatic cell</a>s and <a href="germ%20cell">germ cell</a>s (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a>), and adopted <a href="Hugo%20de%20Vries">Hugo de Vries</a>'s theory of <a href="pangene">pangene</a>s. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental <a href="embryology">embryology</a>.

By the mid-1850s the <a href="miasma%20theory%20of%20disease">miasma theory of disease</a> was largely superseded by the <a href="germ%20theory%20of%20disease">germ theory of disease</a>, creating extensive interest in microorganisms and their interactions with other forms of life. By the 1880s, <a href="bacteriology">bacteriology</a> was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through the work of <a href="Robert%20Koch">Robert Koch</a>, who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on <a href="Agar%20plate">agar gels</a> containing specific nutrients in <a href="Petri%20dish">Petri dish</a>es. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter (<a href="spontaneous%20generation">spontaneous generation</a>) was attacked in a series of experiments carried out by <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, while debates over <a href="vitalism">vitalism</a> vs. <a href="mechanism%20%28philosophy%29">mechanism</a> (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.

In chemistry, one central issue was the distinction between organic and inorganic substances, especially in the context of organic transformations such as <a href="Fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">fermentation</a> and <a href="putrefaction">putrefaction</a>. Since Aristotle these had been considered essentially biological ("<a href="vitalism">vital</a>") processes. However, <a href="Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich Wöhler</a>, <a href="Justus%20Liebig">Justus Liebig</a> and other pioneers of the rising field of <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>—building on the work of Lavoisier—showed that the organic world could often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 Wöhler showed that the organic substance <a href="urea">urea</a> could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to <a href="vitalism">vitalism</a>. Cell extracts ("ferments") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with <a href="diastase">diastase</a> in 1833. By the end of the 19th century the concept of <a href="enzymes">enzymes</a> was well established, though equations of <a href="chemical%20kinetics">chemical kinetics</a> would not be applied to enzymatic reactions until the early 20th century.

Physiologists such as <a href="Claude%20Bernard">Claude Bernard</a> explored (through vivisection and other experimental methods) the chemical and physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, laying the groundwork for <a href="endocrinology">endocrinology</a> (a field that developed quickly after the discovery of the first <a href="hormone">hormone</a>, <a href="secretin">secretin</a>, in 1902), <a href="biomechanics">biomechanics</a>, and the study of <a href="nutrition">nutrition</a> and <a href="digestion">digestion</a>. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and biology, grew dramatically over the second half of the 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a central concern, and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.

At the beginning of the 20th century, biological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a> mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-<a href="vitalism">vitalist</a> experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The tremendous success of experimental approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, experimental work replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.

In the early 20th century, naturalists were faced with increasing pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. <a href="Ecology">Ecology</a> had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the <a href="biogeochemical%20cycle">biogeochemical cycle</a> concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the <a href="quadrat">quadrat</a> and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the <a href="Carnegie%20Station%20for%20Experimental%20Evolution">Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution</a> and the <a href="Marine%20Biological%20Laboratory">Marine Biological Laboratory</a> provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.

The <a href="ecological%20succession">ecological succession</a> concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by <a href="Henry%20Chandler%20Cowles">Henry Chandler Cowles</a> and <a href="Frederic%20Clements">Frederic Clements</a>, was important in early plant ecology. <a href="Alfred%20Lotka">Alfred Lotka</a>'s <a href="predator-prey%20equations">predator-prey equations</a>, <a href="G.%20Evelyn%20Hutchinson">G. Evelyn Hutchinson</a>'s studies of the biogeography and biogeochemical structure of lakes and rivers (<a href="limnology">limnology</a>) and <a href="Charles%20Sutherland%20Elton">Charles Elton's</a> studies of animal <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>s were pioneers among the succession of quantitative methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent discipline in the 1940s and 1950s after <a href="Eugene%20P.%20Odum">Eugene P. Odum</a> synthesized many of the concepts of <a href="ecosystem%20ecology">ecosystem ecology</a>, placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) at the center of the field.

In the 1960s, as evolutionary theorists explored the possibility of multiple <a href="units%20of%20selection">units of selection</a>, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In <a href="population%20ecology">population ecology</a>, debate over <a href="group%20selection">group selection</a> was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly with the rise of the environmental movement; the <a href="International%20Biological%20Program">International Biological Program</a> attempted to apply the methods of <a href="big%20science">big science</a> (which had been so successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as <a href="island%20biogeography">island biogeography</a> and the <a href="Hubbard%20Brook%20Experimental%20Forest">Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest</a> helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.

1900 marked the so-called "rediscovery of Mendel": <a href="Hugo%20de%20Vries">Hugo de Vries</a>, <a href="Carl%20Correns">Carl Correns</a>, and <a href="Erich%20von%20Tschermak">Erich von Tschermak</a> independently arrived at <a href="Mendel%27s%20laws">Mendel's laws</a> (which were not actually present in Mendel's work). Soon after, cytologists (cell biologists) proposed that <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s were the hereditary material. Between 1910 and 1915, <a href="Thomas%20Hunt%20Morgan">Thomas Hunt Morgan</a> and the "<a href="Drosophilists">Drosophilists</a>" in his fly lab forged these two ideas—both controversial—into the "Mendelian-chromosome theory" of heredity. They quantified the phenomenon of genetic linkage and postulated that genes reside on chromosomes like beads on string; they hypothesized <a href="Chromosomal%20crossover">crossing over</a> to explain linkage and constructed <a href="genetic%20map">genetic map</a>s of the fruit fly "<a href="Drosophila%20melanogaster">Drosophila melanogaster</a>", which became a widely used <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>.

Hugo de Vries tried to link the new genetics with evolution; building on his work with heredity and <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a>, he proposed a theory of <a href="mutationism">mutationism</a>, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. <a href="Lamarckism">Lamarckism</a> also had many adherents. <a href="Darwinism">Darwinism</a> was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by <a href="biometry">biometricians</a>, which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following the acceptance of the Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of <a href="population%20genetics">population genetics</a>, with the work of <a href="R.A.%20Fisher">R.A. Fisher</a>, <a href="J.B.S.%20Haldane">J.B.S. Haldane</a> and <a href="Sewall%20Wright">Sewall Wright</a>, unified the idea of evolution by <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> with <a href="Mendelian%20inheritance">Mendelian genetics</a>, producing the <a href="Modern%20synthesis%20%2820th%20century%29">modern synthesis</a>. The <a href="inheritance%20of%20acquired%20characters">inheritance of acquired characters</a> was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.

In the second half of the century the ideas of population genetics began to be applied in the new discipline of the genetics of behavior, <a href="sociobiology">sociobiology</a>, and, especially in humans, <a href="evolutionary%20psychology">evolutionary psychology</a>. In the 1960s <a href="W.D.%20Hamilton">W.D. Hamilton</a> and others developed <a href="game%20theory">game theory</a> approaches to explain <a href="altruism">altruism</a> from an evolutionary perspective through <a href="kin%20selection">kin selection</a>. The possible origin of higher organisms through <a href="endosymbiosis">endosymbiosis</a>, and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the <a href="gene-centered%20view%20of%20evolution">gene-centered view</a> (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the <a href="neutral%20theory%20of%20molecular%20evolution">neutral theory</a> (which made <a href="genetic%20drift">genetic drift</a> a key factor) spawned perennial debates over the proper balance of <a href="adaptationism">adaptationism</a> and contingency in evolutionary theory.

In the 1970s <a href="Stephen%20Jay%20Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a> and <a href="Niles%20Eldredge">Niles Eldredge</a> proposed the theory of <a href="punctuated%20equilibrium">punctuated equilibrium</a> which holds that stasis is the most prominent feature of the fossil record, and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time. In 1980 <a href="Luis%20Walter%20Alvarez">Luis Alvarez</a> and <a href="Walter%20Alvarez">Walter Alvarez</a> proposed the hypothesis that an <a href="impact%20event">impact event</a> was responsible for the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20extinction%20event">Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event</a>. Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine organisms published by <a href="Jack%20Sepkoski">Jack Sepkoski</a> and <a href="David%20M.%20Raup">David M. Raup</a> led to a better appreciation of the importance of <a href="mass%20extinction%20events">mass extinction events</a> to the history of life on earth.

By the end of the 19th century all of the major pathways of <a href="drug%20metabolism">drug metabolism</a> had been discovered, along with the outlines of protein and fatty acid metabolism and urea synthesis. In the early decades of the 20th century, the minor components of foods in human nutrition, the <a href="vitamins">vitamins</a>, began to be isolated and synthesized. Improved laboratory techniques such as <a href="chromatography">chromatography</a> and <a href="electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a> led to rapid advances in physiological chemistry, which—as "biochemistry"—began to achieve independence from its medical origins. In the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists—led by <a href="Hans%20Adolf%20Krebs">Hans Krebs</a> and <a href="Carl%20Ferdinand%20Cori">Carl</a> and <a href="Gerty%20Cori">Gerty Cori</a>—began to work out many of the central <a href="metabolic%20pathways">metabolic pathways</a> of life: the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a>, <a href="glycogenesis">glycogenesis</a> and <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a>, and the synthesis of <a href="steroid">steroid</a>s and <a href="porphyrin">porphyrin</a>s. Between the 1930s and 1950s, <a href="Fritz%20Lipmann">Fritz Lipmann</a> and others established the role of <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a> as the universal carrier of energy in the cell, and <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a> as the powerhouse of the cell. Such traditionally biochemical work continued to be very actively pursued throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.

Following the rise of classical genetics, many biologists—including a new wave of physical scientists in biology—pursued the question of the gene and its physical nature. <a href="Warren%20Weaver">Warren Weaver</a>—head of the science division of the <a href="Rockefeller%20Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a>—issued grants to promote research that applied the methods of physics and chemistry to basic biological problems, coining the term "<a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a>" for this approach in 1938; many of the significant biological breakthroughs of the 1930s and 1940s were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.

Like biochemistry, the overlapping disciplines of <a href="bacteriology">bacteriology</a> and <a href="virology">virology</a> (later combined as "microbiology"), situated between science and medicine, developed rapidly in the early 20th century. <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20d%27Herelle">Félix d'Herelle</a>'s isolation of <a href="bacteriophage">bacteriophage</a> during World War I initiated a long line of research focused on phage viruses and the bacteria they infect.

The development of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was essential for the development of <a href="molecular%20genetics">molecular genetics</a>. After early work with "Drosophila" and <a href="maize">maize</a>, the adoption of simpler <a href="Scientific%20modelling">model system</a>s like the bread mold "<a href="Neurospora%20crassa">Neurospora crassa</a>" made it possible to connect genetics to biochemistry, most importantly with <a href="George%20Wells%20Beadle">Beadle</a> and <a href="Edward%20Lawrie%20Tatum">Tatum</a>'s <a href="one%20gene-one%20enzyme%20hypothesis">one gene-one enzyme hypothesis</a> in 1941. Genetics experiments on even simpler systems like <a href="tobacco%20mosaic%20virus">tobacco mosaic virus</a> and <a href="bacteriophage">bacteriophage</a>, aided by the new technologies of <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscopy</a> and <a href="ultracentrifuge">ultracentrifugation</a>, forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of "life"; virus heredity and reproducing <a href="nucleoprotein">nucleoprotein</a> cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.

<a href="Oswald%20Avery">Oswald Avery</a> showed in 1943 that <a href="DNA">DNA</a> was likely the genetic material of the chromosome, not its protein; the issue was settled decisively with the 1952 <a href="Hershey%E2%80%93Chase%20experiment">Hershey–Chase experiment</a>—one of many contributions from the so-called <a href="phage%20group">phage group</a> centered around physicist-turned-biologist <a href="Max%20Delbr%C3%BCck">Max Delbrück</a>. In 1953 <a href="James%20Watson">James Watson</a> and <a href="Francis%20Crick">Francis Crick</a>, building on the work of <a href="Maurice%20Wilkins">Maurice Wilkins</a> and <a href="Rosalind%20Franklin">Rosalind Franklin</a>, suggested that the structure of DNA was a double helix. In their famous paper "<a href="Molecular%20structure%20of%20Nucleic%20Acids">Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids</a>", Watson and Crick noted coyly, "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material." After the 1958 <a href="Meselson%E2%80%93Stahl%20experiment">Meselson–Stahl experiment</a> confirmed the <a href="semiconservative%20replication">semiconservative replication</a> of DNA, it was clear to most biologists that nucleic acid sequence must somehow determine <a href="Peptide%20sequence">amino acid sequence</a> in proteins; physicist <a href="George%20Gamow">George Gamow</a> proposed that a fixed <a href="genetic%20code">genetic code</a> connected proteins and DNA. Between 1953 and 1961, there were few known biological sequences—either DNA or protein—but an abundance of proposed code systems, a situation made even more complicated by expanding knowledge of the intermediate role of <a href="RNA">RNA</a>. To actually decipher the code, it took an extensive series of experiments in biochemistry and bacterial genetics, between 1961 and 1966—most importantly the work of <a href="Marshall%20Warren%20Nirenberg">Nirenberg</a> and <a href="Har%20Gobind%20Khorana">Khorana</a>.

In addition to the Division of Biology at <a href="Caltech">Caltech</a>, the <a href="Laboratory%20of%20Molecular%20Biology">Laboratory of Molecular Biology</a> (and its precursors) at <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge</a>, and a handful of other institutions, the <a href="Pasteur%20Institute">Pasteur Institute</a> became a major center for molecular biology research in the late 1950s. Scientists at Cambridge, led by <a href="Max%20Perutz">Max Perutz</a> and <a href="John%20Kendrew">John Kendrew</a>, focused on the rapidly developing field of <a href="structural%20biology">structural biology</a>, combining <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a> with <a href="Molecular%20modelling">Molecular modelling</a> and the new computational possibilities of <a href="History%20of%20computing%20hardware">digital computing</a> (benefiting both directly and indirectly from the <a href="military%20funding%20of%20science">military funding of science</a>). A number of biochemists led by <a href="Frederick%20Sanger">Frederick Sanger</a> later joined the Cambridge lab, bringing together the study of <a href="macromolecule">macromolecular</a> structure and function. At the Pasteur Institute, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Jacob">François Jacob</a> and <a href="Jacques%20Monod">Jacques Monod</a> followed the 1959 <a href="Arthur%20Pardee%23The%20PaJaMo%20experiment">PaJaMo experiment</a> with a series of publications regarding the <a href="lac%20operon">"lac"</a> <a href="operon">operon</a> that established the concept of <a href="gene%20regulation">gene regulation</a> and identified what came to be known as <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a>. By the mid-1960s, the intellectual core of molecular biology—a model for the molecular basis of metabolism and reproduction— was largely complete.

The late 1950s to the early 1970s was a period of intense research and institutional expansion for molecular biology, which had only recently become a somewhat coherent discipline. In what organismic biologist <a href="E.%20O.%20Wilson">E. O. Wilson</a> called "The Molecular Wars", the methods and practitioners of molecular biology spread rapidly, often coming to dominate departments and even entire disciplines. Molecularization was particularly important in <a href="genetics">genetics</a>, <a href="immunology">immunology</a>, <a href="embryology">embryology</a>, and <a href="neurobiology">neurobiology</a>, while the idea that life is controlled by a "<a href="genetic%20program">genetic program</a>"—a metaphor Jacob and Monod introduced from the emerging fields of <a href="cybernetics">cybernetics</a> and <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>—became an influential perspective throughout biology. Immunology in particular became linked with molecular biology, with innovation flowing both ways: the <a href="clonal%20selection%20theory">clonal selection theory</a> developed by <a href="Niels%20Jerne">Niels Jerne</a> and <a href="Frank%20Macfarlane%20Burnet">Frank Macfarlane Burnet</a> in the mid-1950s helped shed light on the general mechanisms of protein synthesis.

Resistance to the growing influence of molecular biology was especially evident in <a href="evolutionary%20biology">evolutionary biology</a>. <a href="Protein%20sequencing">Protein sequencing</a> had great potential for the quantitative study of evolution (through the <a href="molecular%20clock%20hypothesis">molecular clock hypothesis</a>), but leading evolutionary biologists questioned the relevance of molecular biology for answering the big questions of evolutionary causation. Departments and disciplines fractured as organismic biologists asserted their importance and independence: <a href="Theodosius%20Dobzhansky">Theodosius Dobzhansky</a> made the famous statement that "<a href="nothing%20in%20biology%20makes%20sense%20except%20in%20the%20light%20of%20evolution">nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution</a>" as a response to the molecular challenge. The issue became even more critical after 1968; <a href="Motoo%20Kimura">Motoo Kimura</a>'s <a href="neutral%20theory%20of%20molecular%20evolution">neutral theory of molecular evolution</a> suggested that <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> was not the ubiquitous cause of evolution, at least at the molecular level, and that molecular evolution might be a fundamentally different process from <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> evolution. (Resolving this "molecular/morphological paradox" has been a central focus of molecular evolution research since the 1960s.)

<a href="Biotechnology">Biotechnology</a> in the general sense has been an important part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of <a href="brewing">brewing</a> and <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, <a href="Industrial%20fermentation">fermentation</a> proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> and <a href="steroids">steroids</a> to foods like "<a href="Chlorella">Chlorella</a>" and single-cell protein to <a href="gasohol">gasohol</a>—as well as a wide range of <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a> <a href="high-yield%20crop">high-yield crop</a>s and agricultural technologies, the basis for the <a href="Green%20Revolution">Green Revolution</a>.

Biotechnology in the modern sense of <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a> began in the 1970s, with the invention of <a href="recombinant%20DNA">recombinant DNA</a> techniques. <a href="Restriction%20enzyme">Restriction enzyme</a>s were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following on the heels of the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral <a href="genes">genes</a>. Beginning with the lab of <a href="Paul%20Berg">Paul Berg</a> in 1972 (aided by "<a href="EcoRI">EcoRI</a>" from <a href="Herbert%20Boyer">Herbert Boyer</a>'s lab, building on work with <a href="ligase">ligase</a> by <a href="Arthur%20Kornberg">Arthur Kornberg</a>'s lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first <a href="transgenic%20organisms">transgenic organisms</a>. Soon after, others began using <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a> <a href="Vector%20%28molecular%20biology%29">vectors</a> and adding genes for <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">antibiotic resistance</a>, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.

Wary of the potential dangers (particularly the possibility of a prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm and fearful restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 <a href="Asilomar%20Conference%20on%20Recombinant%20DNA">Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA</a> created policy recommendations and concluded that the technology could be used safely.

Following Asilomar, new genetic engineering techniques and applications developed rapidly. <a href="DNA%20sequencing">DNA sequencing</a> methods improved greatly (pioneered by <a href="Frederick%20Sanger">Frederick Sanger</a> and <a href="Walter%20Gilbert">Walter Gilbert</a>), as did <a href="oligonucleotide">oligonucleotide</a> synthesis and <a href="transfection">transfection</a> techniques. Researchers learned to control the expression of <a href="transgene">transgene</a>s, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing human genes for the production of human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and <a href="splicing%20%28genetics%29">splicing</a>, higher organisms had a much more complex system of <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a> than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing human <a href="insulin">insulin</a>, was won by <a href="Genentech">Genentech</a>. This marked the beginning of the biotech boom (and with it, the era of <a href="gene%20patent">gene patent</a>s), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.

By the 1980s, protein sequencing had already transformed methods of <a href="scientific%20classification">scientific classification</a> of organisms (especially <a href="cladistics">cladistics</a>) but biologists soon began to use RNA and DNA sequences as <a href="Trait%20%28biology%29">characters</a>; this expanded the significance of <a href="molecular%20evolution">molecular evolution</a> within evolutionary biology, as the results of <a href="molecular%20systematics">molecular systematics</a> could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>. Following the pioneering ideas of <a href="Lynn%20Margulis">Lynn Margulis</a> on <a href="endosymbiotic%20theory">endosymbiotic theory</a>, which holds that some of the <a href="organelles">organelles</a> of <a href="eukaryotic">eukaryotic</a> cells originated from free living <a href="prokaryotic">prokaryotic</a> organisms through <a href="symbiotic">symbiotic</a> relationships, even the overall division of the tree of life was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the <a href="Archaea">Archaea</a>, the <a href="Bacteria">Bacteria</a>, and the <a href="Eukarya">Eukarya</a>) based on <a href="Carl%20Woese">Carl Woese</a>'s pioneering <a href="molecular%20systematics">molecular systematics</a> work with <a href="16S%20ribosomal%20RNA">16S rRNA</a> sequencing.

The development and popularization of the <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a> (PCR) in mid-1980s (by <a href="Kary%20Mullis">Kary Mullis</a> and others at <a href="Cetus%20Corp.">Cetus Corp.</a>) marked another watershed in the history of modern biotechnology, greatly increasing the ease and speed of genetic analysis. Coupled with the use of <a href="expressed%20sequence%20tags">expressed sequence tags</a>, PCR led to the discovery of many more genes than could be found through traditional biochemical or genetic methods and opened the possibility of sequencing entire genomes.

The unity of much of the <a href="morphogenesis">morphogenesis</a> of organisms from fertilized egg to adult began to be unraveled after the discovery of the <a href="homeobox">homeobox</a> genes, first in fruit flies, then in other insects and animals, including humans. These developments led to advances in the field of <a href="evolutionary%20developmental%20biology">evolutionary developmental biology</a> towards understanding how the various <a href="body%20plan">body plan</a>s of the animal phyla have evolved and how they are related to one another.

The <a href="Human%20Genome%20Project">Human Genome Project</a>—the largest, most costly single biological study ever undertaken—began in 1988 under the leadership of <a href="James%20D.%20Watson">James D. Watson</a>, after preliminary work with genetically simpler model organisms such as "<a href="E.%20coli">E. coli</a>", "<a href="S.%20cerevisiae">S. cerevisiae</a>" and "<a href="Caenorhabditis%20elegans">C. elegans</a>". <a href="Shotgun%20sequencing">Shotgun sequencing</a> and gene discovery methods pioneered by <a href="Craig%20Venter">Craig Venter</a>—and fueled by the financial promise of gene patents with <a href="Celera%20Genomics">Celera Genomics</a>— led to a public–private sequencing competition that ended in compromise with the first draft of the human DNA sequence announced in 2000.

At the beginning of the 21st century, biological sciences converged with previously differentiated new and classic disciplines like <a href="Physics">Physics</a> into research fields like <a href="Biophysics">Biophysics</a>. Advances were made in <a href="analytical%20chemistry">analytical chemistry</a> and physics instrumentation including improved sensors, optics, tracers, instrumentation, signal processing, networks, robots, satellites, and compute power for data collection, storage, analysis, modeling, visualization, and simulations.

Sinking of SS Princess Alice

SS "Princess Alice, formerly PS "Bute, was a passenger <a href="paddle%20steamer">paddle steamer</a> that sank on 3 September 1878 after a collision with the <a href="Collier%20%28ship%20type%29">collier</a> "Bywell Castle" on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>. Between 600 and 700 people died, all from "Princess Alice", the greatest loss of life of any British inland waterway shipping accident. No passenger list or headcount was made, so the exact figure of those who died has never been known.

Built in <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a>, Scotland, in 1865, "Princess Alice" was employed for two years in Scotland before being purchased by the Waterman's Steam Packet Co to carry passengers on the Thames. By 1878 she was owned by the <a href="Woolwich%20Steam%20Packet%20Company">London Steamboat Co</a> and was captained by William R. H. Grinstead; the ship carried passengers on a stopping service from Swan Pier, near <a href="London%20Bridge">London Bridge</a>, downstream to <a href="Sheerness">Sheerness</a>, Kent, and back. On her homeward journey, at an hour after sunset on 3 September 1878, she passed Tripcock Point and entered <a href="Gallions%20Reach">Gallions Reach</a>, she took the wrong sailing line and was hit by "Bywell Castle"; the point of the collision was the area of the Thames where of London's raw sewage had just been released. "Princess Alice" broke into three parts and sank quickly; her passengers drowned in the heavily polluted waters.

Grinstead died in the collision, so the subsequent investigations never established which course he thought he was supposed to take. The jury in the <a href="Coroner%23England%20and%20Wales">coroner</a>'s <a href="Inquests%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">inquest</a> considered both vessels at fault, but more blame was put on the collier; the inquiry run by the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> found that "Princess Alice" had not followed the right path and was culpable. In the aftermath of the sinking, changes were made to the release and treatment of sewage, and it was transported to, and released into, the sea. The <a href="Marine%20Police%20Force">Marine Police Force</a>—the branch of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a> that had responsibility for policing the Thames—were provided with <a href="steam%20launch">steam launch</a>es, after the rowing boats used up to that point had proved insufficient. Five years after the collision "Bywell Castle" sank in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a> with the loss of all 40 crew.

<a href="Caird%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Caird & Company</a> of <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a>, Scotland, launched the passenger <a href="paddle%20steamer">paddle steamer</a> "Bute" on 29 March 1865. She entered service on 1 July 1865. The ship was long and at the <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a>, and measured 432 <a href="gross%20registered%20ton">gross registered ton</a>s. "Bute" had been built for the Wemyss Bay Railway Company, for whom she carried passengers between <a href="Wemyss%20Bay">Wemyss Bay</a> and <a href="Rothesay">Rothesay</a>. In 1867 she was sold to the Waterman's Steam Packet Co. to travel on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>; the company renamed the vessel "Princess Alice", after <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s <a href="Princess%20Alice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">third child</a>. In 1870 she was sold to the <a href="Woolwich%20Steam%20Packet%20Company">Woolwich Steam Packet Company</a> and was operated as an excursion steamer; the company later changed its name to the London Steamboat Company. In 1873 the ship carried <a href="Naser%20al-Din%20Shah%20Qajar">Naser al-Din Shah Qajar</a>, the <a href="Qajar%20dynasty">Shah of Persia</a> up the Thames to <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>, and became known to many locals as "The Shah's boat".

When "Princess Alice" was acquired by the Woolwich Steam Packet Company, the company made several alterations to the ship, including the installation of new boilers and making the five bulkheads watertight. The vessel had been inspected and was passed as safe by the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a>. In 1878 another survey by the Board of Trade allowed the ship to carry a maximum of 936 passengers between London and <a href="Gravesend">Gravesend</a> in calm water.

The <a href="Collier%20%28ship%29">collier</a> SS "Bywell Castle" was built in Newcastle in 1870 and was owned by Messrs Hall of Newcastle. Her <a href="gross%20registered%20ton">gross registered ton</a>nage was 1376, she was long and at the beam; her depth of hold was . The <a href="Sea%20captain">master</a> was Captain Thomas Harrison.

On 3 September 1878 "Princess Alice" was making what was billed as a "Moonlight Trip" from Swan Pier, near <a href="London%20Bridge">London Bridge</a>, downstream to <a href="Sheerness">Sheerness</a>, Kent, and back. During the journey she called at <a href="Blackwall%2C%20London">Blackwall</a>, <a href="North%20Woolwich">North Woolwich</a> and <a href="Rosherville%20Gardens">Rosherville Gardens</a>; many of the Londoners on board were travelling to Rosherville to visit the <a href="pleasure%20garden">pleasure garden</a>s that had been built 40 years before. As the London Steamboat Co. owned several ships, passengers could use their tickets interchangeably on the day, stopping off to travel on or back on different vessels if they wanted; for tickets from Swan Pier to Rosherville, the cost was two <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s.

"Princess Alice" left Rosherville at about 6:30 pm on her return to Swan Pier; she was carrying close to her full capacity of passengers, although no lists were kept, and the exact number of people on board is unknown. The master of "Princess Alice", 47-year-old Captain William Grinstead, allowed his <a href="helmsman">helmsman</a> to stay at Gravesend, and replaced him with a passenger, a seaman named John Ayers. Ayers had little experience of the Thames, or of helming a craft such as "Princess Alice". Between 7:20 pm and 7:40 pm, "Princess Alice" had passed Tripcock Point, entered <a href="Gallions%20Reach">Gallions Reach</a> and come within sight of the North Woolwich Pier—where many passengers were to disembark—when "Bywell Castle" was sighted. "Bywell Castle" usually carried coal to Africa, but had just been repainted at a <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a>. She was due to sail up to Newcastle to pick up coal bound for <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, Egypt. Harrison was unfamiliar with the conditions, so employed Christopher Dix, an experienced Thames <a href="Maritime%20pilot">river pilot</a>, though he was not obliged to do so. As "Bywell Castle" had a raised <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a>, Dix did not have a clear view in front of him, so a seaman was placed on lookout.
On leaving Millwall, "Bywell Castle" proceeded down river at five knots; she kept roughly to the middle of the river, except where other craft were in her way. Approaching Gallions Reach, Dix saw "Princess Alice"s red <a href="Port%20and%20starboard">port</a> light approaching on a course to pass starboard of them. Grinstead, travelling up the river against the tide, followed the normal watermen's practice of seeking the <a href="slack%20water">slack water</a> on the south side of the river. He altered the ship's course, bringing her into the path of "Bywell Castle". Seeing the imminent collision, Grinstead shouted to the larger vessel "Where are you coming to! Good God! Where are you coming to!" Although Dix tried to manoeuvre his vessel out of a collision course, and ordered the engines to be put into "reverse full speed", it was too late. "Princess Alice" was struck on the starboard side just in front of the paddle box at an angle of 13 degrees; she split in two and sank within four minutes—her boilers separating from the structure as it sank.

The crew of "Bywell Castle" dropped ropes from their deck for the passengers of "Princess Alice" to climb; they also threw anything that would float into the water for people to hold. Other crew from "Bywell Castle" launched their lifeboat and rescued 14 people, and crews from boats moored nearby did the same. Residents from both banks of the Thames, particularly the boatmen of local factories, launched vessels to rescue who they could. Many of the passengers from "Princess Alice" were unable to swim; the long heavy dresses worn by women also hindered their efforts to stay afloat. "Princess Alice"s sister ship, "Duke of Teck", was steaming ten minutes behind her; she arrived too late to rescue anyone left in the water. Only two people who had been below decks or in the saloon survived the collision; a diver who later examined the saloon reported that the passengers were jammed together in the doorways, mostly still upright.

About 130 people were rescued from the collision, but several died later from ingesting the water. "Princess Alice" sank at the point where London's sewage <a href="pumping%20station">pumping station</a>s were sited. The twice-daily release of of raw sewage from the sewer outfalls <a href="Abbey%20Mills%20Pumping%20Station">Abbey Mills</a>, at <a href="Barking%2C%20London">Barking</a>, and the <a href="Crossness%20Pumping%20Station">Crossness Pumping Station</a> had occurred one hour before the collision. In a letter to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" shortly after the collision, a chemist described the outflow as:

Two continuous columns of decomposed fermenting sewage, hissing like soda-water with baneful gases, so black that the water is stained for miles and discharging a corrupt charnel-house odour, that will be remembered by all ... as being particularly depressing and sickening.
The water was also polluted by the untreated output from <a href="Beckton%20Gas%20Works">Beckton Gas Works</a>, and several local chemical factories. To add to the foulness of the water, a fire in <a href="Thames%20Street%2C%20London">Thames Street</a> earlier that day had resulted in oil and petroleum entering the river.

"Bywell Castle" moored at Deptford to await the action of the authorities and the inquest. That night Harrison and Belding, the <a href="first%20mate">first mate</a>, wrote the <a href="ship%27s%20log">ship's log</a> to describe the event:

At 6:30 left the West Dock, Millwall, in charge of Mr Dicks, pilot; proceeding slowly, the master and pilot being on the upper bridge ... Light air and weather little hazy. At 7:45 pm proceeding at half speed down Gallions Reach. Being about centre of the Reach, observed an excursion steamer coming up Barking Reach, showing her red and masthead lights, when we ported our helm to keep over towards Tripcock Point. As the vessel neared, observed that the other steamer had ported, and immediately afterwards saw that she had starboarded and was trying to cross our bows, showing her green light close under the port bow. Seeing collision inevitable, stopped our engines and reversed full speed, when the two vessels collided, the bow of "Bywell Castle" cutting into the other steamer, which was crowded with passengers, with a dreadful crash. Took immediate means for saving life by hauling up over the bows several men of the passengers, throwing rope's-ends over all round the ship, throwing over four lifebuoys, a hold ladder and several planks, and getting out three boats, keeping the whistle blowing loudly all the time for assistance, which was rendered by several boats from shore and a boat from a passing steamer. The excursion steamer, which turned out to be "Princess Alice", turning over and sinking under the bows. Succeeded in rescuing a great many passengers and anchored for the night. About 8:30 pm the steamer "Duke of Teck" came alongside and took off such passengers as had not been taken on shore in the boats.

News of the sinking was telegraphed back to the centre of London, and soon filtered through to those waiting at Swan Pier for the steamer's return. Relatives made their way to the London Steamboat offices near <a href="Blackfriars%2C%20London">Blackfriars</a> to wait for more news; many took the train from <a href="London%20Bridge%20station">London Bridge</a> to <a href="Woolwich%20Arsenal%20station">Woolwich</a>. The crowds grew during the night and into the following day, as both relatives and sightseers travelled to Woolwich; additional police were drafted in to help control the crowds, and deal with the remains that were being landed. Reports came in of corpses being washed up as far upstream as <a href="Limehouse">Limehouse</a> and down to <a href="Erith">Erith</a>. When bodies were landed, they were stored locally for identification, rather than centrally, although most ended up at <a href="Woolwich%20Dockyard">Woolwich Dockyard</a>. Relatives had to travel between several locations on both sides of the Thames to search for missing family members. Local watermen were hired for £2 a day to search for bodies; they were paid a minimum of five <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shillings</a> for each one they recovered, which sometimes led to fights over the corpses. One of those picked up was that of Grinstead, "Princess Alice"s captain.

Because of the pollution from the sewage and local industrial output, the bodies from the Thames were covered with slime, which was found difficult to clean off; the corpses began to rot at a faster pace than normal, and many of the corpses were unusually bloated. Victims' clothing also began to rot quickly and was discoloured after immersion in the polluted water. Sixteen of those who survived died within two weeks, and several others were ill.

On 4 September Charles Carttar, the <a href="Coroner%23England%20and%20Wales">coroner</a> for West Kent, opened the <a href="Inquests%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">inquest</a> for his region. That day he took the jury to view the corpses at Woolwich Town Hall and Woolwich Pier. There were more bodies on the northern bank, but this lay outside his jurisdiction. Charles Lewis, the coroner for South Essex, visited the Board of Trade and the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> to try to have the remains in his jurisdiction moved to Woolwich to allow one inquest that could cover all the victims and hear the evidence in only one location, but the law meant that the deceased could not be moved until the inquest had been opened and adjourned. Instead, he opened his inquest to formally identify the bodies under his authority, then adjourned proceedings until after Carttar's case had come to a conclusion. He issued burial orders, and the remains were then transferred to Woolwich.
During low tide, part of "Princess Alice"s rail could be seen above the waterline. Plans to raise the ship began on 5 September with a diver examining the wreckage. He found the vessel had broken into three sections—the fore, aft and boilers. He reported back that there were still several bodies on board. Work began the following day to raise the larger fore section, which was long. This was beached at low tide—2:00 am on 7 September—at Woolwich; while she was being pulled ashore, "Bywell Castle" steamed past, leaving London, but without her captain, who remained. The following day large crowds visited Woolwich again to view the raised section of "Princess Alice". Fights broke out in places for the best vantage point, and people rowed up to the wreck to break off souvenirs. An additional 250 policemen were drafted in to help control the crowds. That evening, after most of the crowd had gone home, the larger aft section of the ship was raised and beached next to the bow.
Because of the accelerated rate of decomposition of many of the corpses, the burials of many of those still unidentified took place on 9 September at <a href="Woolwich%20cemetery">Woolwich cemetery</a> in a mass grave; several thousand people were in attendance. The coffins all carried a police identification number, which was also attached to the clothing and personal items which were retained to aid later identification. The same day over 150 private funerals of victims took place.

The first two weeks of Carttar's inquest were given over to the formal identification of the bodies, and visits to the wreck site to examine the remains of "Princess Alice". From 16 September the proceedings began to examine the causes of the collision. Carttar began by bemoaning the media coverage of the event, which suggested strongly that "Bywell Castle" had been in error and should take the blame. He focussed his proceedings on William Beechley, the first body to have been positively identified; Carttar explained to the jury that whatever verdict they reached on Beechley would apply to the other victims. Numerous Thames boatmen appeared as witnesses, all who had been active in the area at the time; their stories of the path taken by "Princess Alice" differed considerably. Most pleasure craft coming upriver on the Thames would round Tripcock Point and head for the northern bank to take advantage of more favourable currents. Had "Princess Alice" done that, "Bywell Castle" would have gone clearly astern of her. Several witnesses stated that once "Princess Alice" rounded Tripcock Point she had been pushed into the centre of the river by currents; the ship then attempted to turn to port, which would have kept her close to the river's southern bank, but in doing so cut across the bows of "Bywell Castle". Several masters of other ships moored nearby who witnessed the collision agreed with this series of events. "Princess Alice"s chief mate denied that his ship had changed direction.

During the inquest evidence was taken from George Purcell, the <a href="Fireman%20%28steam%20engine%29">stoker</a> on "Bywell Castle", who, on the night of the sinking, had told several people that the captain and crew of the ship were drunk. Under oath he changed his claims, and stated that they were sober, and that he had no recollection of claiming that anyone was drunk. Evidence given by other members of "Bywell Castle"s crew showed it had been Purcell that had been drunk; one crewman said that "Purcell was like the generality of firemen. He was rather the worse for drink, but not so bad that he could not take his watch". Evidence was also taken concerning the state of the Thames at the point the ship sank, and of the construction and stability of "Princess Alice". On 14 November, after twelve hours of discussion, the inquest released its verdict; four members of the nineteen-member jury refused to sign the statement. Their verdict was:
That the death of the said William Beachey and others was occasioned by drowning in the waters of the River Thames from a collision that occurred after sunset between a steam vessel called the "Bywell Castle" and a steam vessel called the "Princess Alice" whereby the "Princess Alice" was cut in two and sunk, such collision not being wilful; that the "Bywell Castle" did not take the necessary precaution of easing, stopping and reversing her engines in time and that the "Princess Alice" contributed to the collision by not stopping and going astern; that all collisions in the opinion of the jury might in future be avoided if proper and stringent rules and regulations were laid down for all steam navigation on the River Thames.
Addenda:

Running at the same time as the coroner's inquest was a Board of Trade inquiry. Specific charges were laid against Captain Harrison, two of the crew members of "Bywell Castle", and against Long, the first mate of "Princess Alice"; all had their licences suspended at the start of the hearing. The Board of Trade proceedings began on 14 October 1878 and continued until 6 November. The board found that "Princess Alice" had breached Rule 29, Section (d) of the Board of Trade Regulations and the Regulations of the Thames Conservancy Board, 1872. This stated that if two ships are heading towards each other, they should pass on the port side of each other. As "Princess Alice" had not followed this procedure, the Board found "Princess Alice" to blame and that "Bywell Castle" could not avoid the collision.
The company that owned "Princess Alice" sued the owners of "Bywell Castle" for £20,000 compensation; the owners of "Bywell Castle" counter-sued for £2,000. The case was heard in the Admiralty Division of the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court of Justice</a> in late 1878. After two weeks, the judgment was that both vessels were to blame for the collision.

As no passenger list was kept on "Princess Alice"—or a record of the number of people on board—it was not possible to calculate the number of people who died: figures vary from 600 to 700. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" reported that "the coroner believes that there are from 60 to 80 bodies unrecovered from the river. The total number of lives lost must thus have been from 630 to 650". Michael Foley, in his examination of disasters on the Thames, observes that "there was no proof of the final death toll. However, around 640 bodies were eventually recovered". The sinking was the worst inland disaster on water in the UK.

The <a href="Mansion%20House%2C%20London">Mansion House</a> fund for the victims had been opened by the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a> in the aftermath of the sinking; by the time it closed it had raised £35,000, which was distributed among the victims' families.

During the 1880s London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Board%20of%20Works">Metropolitan Board of Works</a> began to purify the sewage at Crossness and Beckton, rather than dumping the untreated waste into the river, and a series of six sludge boats were ordered to ship effluent into the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> for dumping. The first boat commissioned in June 1887 was named "Bazalgette"—after <a href="Joseph%20Bazalgette">Joseph Bazalgette</a>, who had <a href="Great%20Stink%23Construction">rebuilt London's sewer system</a>. The practice of dumping at sea continued until December 1998.

Until "Princess Alice" sank, the <a href="Marine%20Police%20Force">Marine Police Force</a>—the branch of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a> that had responsibility for policing the Thames—relied on rowing boats for their work. The inquest into the sinking of "Princess Alice" found that these were insufficient for the requirements of the role, and that they should be replaced by <a href="steam%20launch">steam launch</a>es. The first two launches entered service in the mid 1880s; eight were working by 1898. The <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Dock">Royal Albert Dock</a>, which opened in 1880, helped to separate heavy goods traffic from smaller boats; this and global adoption of emergency signalling lights on boats both helped avoid future tragedies.

After 23,000 people donated to a <a href="Sixpence%20%28British%20coin%29">sixpenny</a> fund, a memorial <a href="Celtic%20cross">Celtic cross</a> was erected in Woolwich Cemetery in May 1880. <a href="St%20Mary%20Magdalene%20Woolwich">St Mary Magdalene Woolwich</a>, the local parish church also later installed a stained glass memorial window. In 2008 a <a href="National%20Lottery%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Lottery</a> grant funded the installation of a memorial plaque at <a href="Barking%20Creek">Barking Creek</a> to mark the 130th anniversary of the sinking.

"Princess Alice"s owners, the London Steamboat Co, purchased the wreck of the vessel from the <a href="Thames%20Conservancy">Thames Conservancy</a> for £350; the engines were salvaged and the remainder sent to a <a href="ship%20breaker">ship breaker</a>. The London Steamboat Co were bankrupt within six years, and their successors went into financial difficulties three years after that. According to the historian <a href="Jerry%20White%20%28historian%29">Jerry White</a>, along with competition from the railways and bus services, the sinking of "Princess Alice" "had some impact ... in blighting the tidal Thames as a pleasure-ground". "Bywell Castle" was reported missing on 29 January 1883 sailing between Alexandria and Hull; it carried a cargo of cottonseed and beans. In February 1883 newspapers carried a final report:

It is believed that the steamer "Bywell Castle", which ran down the saloon boat "Princess Alice", off Woolwich, some years ago, has been lost in the Bay of Biscay, in the gale which proved fatal to the "Kenmure Castle". The "Bywell Castle" carried a crew of 40 men and her cargo consisted of Egyptian produce.

John Tyndall (politician)

John Hutchyns Tyndall (14 July 193419 July 2005) was a <a href="British%20people">British</a> <a href="Fascism">fascist</a> political activist. A leading member of various small <a href="Neo-Nazism">neo-Nazi</a> groups during the late 1950s and 1960s, he was chairman of the <a href="National%20Front%20%28UK%29">National Front</a> from 1972 to 1974 and again from 1975 to 1980, and then chairman of the <a href="British%20National%20Party">British National Party</a> from 1982 to 1999. He unsuccessfully stood for election to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> and <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a> on several occasions.

Born in <a href="Devon">Devon</a> and educated in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, Tyndall undertook <a href="national%20service">national service</a> prior to embracing the <a href="far-right%20politics">extreme-right</a>. In the mid-1950s, he joined the <a href="League%20of%20Empire%20Loyalists">League of Empire Loyalists</a> (LEL) and came under the influence of its leader, <a href="A.%20K.%20Chesterton">Arthur Chesterton</a>. Finding the LEL too moderate, in 1957 he and <a href="John%20Bean">John Bean</a> founded the <a href="National%20Labour%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201957%29">National Labour Party</a> (NLP), an explicitly "<a href="Nazism">National Socialist</a>" (Nazi) group. In 1960, the NLP merged with <a href="Colin%20Jordan">Colin Jordan</a>'s <a href="White%20Defence%20League">White Defence League</a> to found the first <a href="British%20National%20Party%20%281960%29">British National Party</a> (BNP). Within the BNP, Tyndall and Jordan established a paramilitary wing called Spearhead, which angered Bean and other party members. They expelled Tyndall and Jordan, who went on to establish the <a href="National%20Socialist%20Movement%20%281960s%29">National Socialist Movement</a> and then the international <a href="World%20Union%20of%20National%20Socialists">World Union of National Socialists</a>. In 1962, they were convicted and briefly imprisoned for their paramilitary activities. After a split with Jordan, Tyndall formed his <a href="Greater%20Britain%20Movement">Greater Britain Movement</a> (GBM) in 1964. Although never changing his basic beliefs, by the mid-1960s, Tyndall was replacing his overt references to Nazism with appeals to <a href="British%20nationalism">British nationalism</a>.

In 1967, Tyndall joined Chesterton's newly founded National Front (NF) and became its leader in 1972, overseeing growing membership and electoral growth. His leadership was threatened by various factions within the party which eventually led to him losing his position as leader in 1974. He resumed this position in 1975, although the latter part of the 1970s saw the party's prospects decline. Following an argument with long-term comrade <a href="Martin%20Webster">Martin Webster</a>, Tyndall resigned from the party in 1980 and formed his short-lived New National Front (NNF). In 1982, he merged the NNF into his own newly formed British National Party (BNP). Under Tyndall, the BNP established itself as the UK's most prominent extreme-right group during the 1980s, although electoral success eluded it. Tyndall's refusal to moderate the BNP's policies or image caused anger among a growing array of "modernisers" in the party, who ousted him in favour of <a href="Nick%20Griffin">Nick Griffin</a> in 1999. In 2005, Tyndall was charged with <a href="Incitement%20to%20ethnic%20or%20racial%20hatred">incitement to racial hatred</a> for comments made at a BNP meeting. He died two days before his trial was due to take place.

Tyndall promoted a <a href="ethnic%20nationalism">racial nationalist</a> belief in a distinct white "British race", arguing that this race was threatened by a Jewish conspiracy to encourage non-white migration into Britain. He called for the establishment of an <a href="authoritarianism">authoritarian</a> state which would deport all non-whites from the country, engage in a <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a> project, and re-establish the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> through the military conquest of parts of Africa. He never gained any mainstream political respectability in the United Kingdom although he proved popular among sectors of the British far-right.

John Tyndall was born at Stork Nest, Topsham Road in <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, <a href="Devon">Devon</a>, on 14 July 1934. His mother was Nellie Tyndall, "née" Parker; his father was George Francis Tyndall. Through the Tyndall family line he was related to both the early English translator of the Bible, <a href="William%20Tyndale">William Tyndale</a>, and the physicist <a href="John%20Tyndall">John Tyndall</a>. His paternal family were <a href="Unionism%20in%20Ireland">British Unionists</a> living in <a href="County%20Waterford">County Waterford</a>, <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, who had a long line of service in the <a href="Royal%20Irish%20Constabulary">Royal Irish Constabulary</a>. His grandfather had been a district inspector in the Constabulary and had fought against the <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army%20%281917%E2%80%9322%29">Irish Republican Army</a> in the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>. His father had moved to <a href="England">England</a>, working as a <a href="Metropolitan%20Police">Metropolitan Police</a> officer, and then as a warden of St George's House, a <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> hostel in <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a>. Tyndall later stated that despite his father having been raised in a British Unionist family, the latter had adopted <a href="internationalism%20%28politics%29">internationalist</a> views. He claimed that his mother exhibited "a kind of basic British patriotism" and that it was she who shaped his early political views. His upbringing was emotionally stable and materially secure. Tyndall studied at <a href="Beckenham%20and%20Penge%20Grammar%20School">Beckenham and Penge Grammar School</a> in west <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, where he attained three <a href="GCE%20Ordinary%20Level%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">O-levels</a>, a "moderate" result. At the school, his achievements had been sporting rather than academic, for he enjoyed playing <a href="cricket">cricket</a> and <a href="association%20football">association football</a> and developed a passion for fitness.

Tyndall did his <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">national service</a> in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> from 1952 to 1954. A member of the <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">Royal Horse Artillery</a>, he achieved the rank of <a href="lance-bombardier">lance-bombardier</a>. On completion, he returned to Britain and turned his attention to political issues. Initially interested in <a href="socialism">socialism</a>, he attended a world youth festival held in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1957. He nevertheless began to regard <a href="left-wing%20politics">left-wing politics</a> as being infused with "anti-British attitudes", moving swiftly to the <a href="right-wing%20politics">political right</a>. He had a devotion to the preservation of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and a hostility to what he regarded as the growing <a href="Permissive%20society">permissiveness of British society</a>, stating that "the smell everywhere was one of decadence". During that decade he read "<a href="Mein%20Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>", the autobiography and political manifesto of the late Nazi leader <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, growing sympathetic to Hitler's <a href="Political%20views%20of%20Adolf%20Hitler">own political beliefs</a> and <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>. Tyndall approved in particular of "the descriptions of the workings of certain Jewish forces in Germany, which seemed uncannily similar to what I had observed of the same kinds of forces in Britain." He concluded that Britain's decision to go to war against <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> was ultimately the result of a conspiracy headed primarily by Jews, a conspiracy which he thought had also masterminded <a href="Modern%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">non-white immigration into Britain</a> after the war.

Around 1957–58, Tyndall decided to commit himself full-time to his political cause, which he was able to do as his job as a salesman allowed him flexible working hours. He decided against joining the <a href="Union%20Movement">Union Movement</a> led by the prominent British fascist <a href="Oswald%20Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a>, disagreeing with its promotion of the <a href="Europe%20a%20Nation">political union of Britain with continental Europe</a>. Instead, he was attracted to the <a href="League%20of%20Empire%20Loyalists">League of Empire Loyalists</a> (LEL) — a right-wing group founded by <a href="A.%20K.%20Chesterton">Arthur Chesterton</a> — after seeing coverage of one of their demonstrations on television. He visited their basement office in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>, where he was given some of their literature. He enjoyed Chesterton's writings and concurred with his <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theory</a> that Jewish people had been plotting to bring down the British Empire. Tyndall began associating with other young men who had joined the LEL. At a <a href="Lewisham%20North%20by-election%2C%201957">February 1957 by-election</a> in <a href="Lewisham%20North%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Lewisham North</a>, Tyndall aided the LEL campaign, during which he met another party member <a href="John%20Bean">John Bean</a>, an industrial chemist. Both Tyndall and Bean were frustrated by the LEL's attempts to exert pressure on the mainstream <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>. They wanted to be involved in a more radical party, one that would combine "nationalism" with "popular socialism" and which would reach out to the white <a href="working%20class">working class</a> through appeals against <a href="British%20African-Caribbean%20people">immigration from the Caribbean</a>.

In April 1958, Tyndall and Bean founded their own extreme-right group, the <a href="National%20Labour%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201957%29">National Labour Party</a> (NLP). The group was based at <a href="Thornton%20Heath">Thornton Heath</a>, <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a> and attracted its early membership from former LEL members living in south and east London. According to the historian Richard Thurlow, the NLP promoted an "English" variant of Nazism, and was more pronounced in its "explicit racism" than the LEL had been, focusing less on bemoaning the decline of the British Empire and more on criticising the arrival of non-white immigrants from former British colonies.

The NLP began co-operating with another extreme-right group, the <a href="White%20Defence%20League">White Defence League</a>, which had been established by <a href="Colin%20Jordan">Colin Jordan</a>, a secondary school teacher. Together the two groups embarked on a project of <a href="1958%20Notting%20Hill%20race%20riots">stirring up racial tensions</a> among white Britons and black Caribbean immigrants in <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a>. Tyndall briefly left the NLP, and in his absence Bean and Jordan merged their respective groups into the <a href="British%20National%20Party%20%281960%29">British National Party</a> (BNP) in 1960. The BNP were racial nationalists, calling for the preservation of a "<a href="Nordic%20race">Nordic race</a>"—of which the "British race" was considered a branch—by removing both immigrants and Jewish influences from Britain. Tyndall soon joined this new BNP, and became a close confidante of Jordan, who helped Tyndall to further embrace <a href="neo-Nazism">neo-Nazism</a>. Tyndall also developed a friendship with <a href="Martin%20Webster">Martin Webster</a>, who became a long-term comrade after watching Tyndall speak at a <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> rally in 1962.

In April 1961, Tyndall self-published his pamphlet, "The Authoritarian State: Its Meaning and Function", which helped to cement his reputation within the <a href="Far-right%20politics%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British far-right</a>. In the pamphlet, he attacked democratic systems of government as part of a conspiracy orchestrated by Jews, quoting from "<a href="The%20Protocols%20of%20the%20Elders%20of%20Zion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>". It called for the replacement of the United Kingdom's <a href="liberal%20democracy">liberal democratic</a> system with an <a href="authoritarianism">authoritarian</a> one in which a "Leader" is given absolute power. 

Within the BNP, Tyndall established an elite group known as Spearhead, members of which wore military-style uniforms inspired by those of the Nazis and underwent paramilitary and ideological training. Tyndall had a great liking for wearing <a href="jackboot">jackboot</a>s; Jordon related that on the way to a far-right meeting in Germany, Tyndall made his entourage look for a shoe shop so that he could purchase a pair of genuine German jackboots. It is likely that there were no more than sixty members of Spearhead. The group campaigned on behalf of imprisoned Nazi war criminals <a href="Rudolf%20Hess">Rudolf Hess</a> and <a href="Adolf%20Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a>. According to the <a href="anti-fascism">anti-fascist</a> activist <a href="Gerry%20Gable">Gerry Gable</a>, Spearhead represented the first "terrorist group" founded by neo-Nazis in Britain. Both Bean and another senior BNP member, <a href="Andrew%20Fountaine">Andrew Fountaine</a>, were concerned about the overt neo-Nazism embraced by Tyndall and Jordan, instead thinking that the BNP should articulate a more British-oriented form of racial nationalism. In 1962, Bean held a meeting at which Tyndall and Jordan were expelled from the party.

Tyndall and Jordan then regrouped around twenty members of Spearhead and formed the <a href="National%20Socialist%20Movement%20%281960s%29">National Socialist Movement</a> (NSM) on 20 April 1962, a date symbolically chosen as the anniversary of Hitler's birthday. They celebrated the event with a cake decorated with a <a href="Swastika%23Nazism">Nazi swastika</a>. According to the historian Richard Thurlow, the NSM was "the most blatant Nazi" group active in Britain during the mid-20th century. The NSM gained few members; an estimate in August 1962 suggested that it had only thirty to fifty. The NSM gained the attention of the media as well as <a href="Special%20Branch">Special Branch</a>. In July 1962, Tyndall was arrested for <a href="Breach%20of%20the%20peace">breaching the peace</a> at a Trafalgar Square rally in which he had been attacked by Jewish military veterans and other anti-fascists after calling the Jewish community a "poisonous maggot feeding on a body in an advanced state of decay". His comments resulted in him being convicted of inciting racial hatred and he was sentenced to six weeks imprisonment, reduced to a fine on appeal. The police then raided the group's London headquarters, after which its leading members were brought to trial at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>, where they were found guilty of establishing a paramilitary group in contravention of Section Two of the <a href="Public%20Order%20Act%201936">Public Order Act 1936</a>. Tyndall received a six-month prison sentence, while Jordan received nine months.

Although the British authorities had prohibited the American neo-Nazi <a href="George%20Lincoln%20Rockwell">George Lincoln Rockwell</a> from entering the UK, the NSM managed to smuggle him in via Ireland to attend a summer camp in August 1962. There, the NSM took part in the formation of the <a href="World%20Union%20of%20National%20Socialists">World Union of National Socialists</a> (WUNS), at which Jordan was elected 'world führer' and Rockwell as his heir. Among those in attendance were the neo-Nazi <a href="Savitri%20Devi">Savitri Devi</a> and the former <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> officer Fred Borth.

Jordan had been courting the French socialite <a href="Fran%C3%A7oise%20Dior">Françoise Dior</a>, but while he had been imprisoned, she entered a relationship with Tyndall and they were engaged to be married. On Jordan's release, Dior left Tyndall and instead married Jordan in October 1963. This contributed to a growing personal feud between the two men, with Jordan accusing Tyndall and Webster of making obscene phone calls to Dior. Tyndall was also angry at what he perceived as Jordan's deviation from orthodox Nazi thought, and by the fact that Jordan's relationship with Dior had been attracting negative sensationalist press attention for the NSM. In the spring of 1964 Tyndall and Webster tried to oust Jordan as the head of the NSM but failed. In later years Tyndall expressed the view that his involvement in the NSM had been a "profound mistake", arguing that then he "still had a lot to learn" and that "when one sees one's nation and people in danger there is less dishonour in acting and acting wrongly than in not acting at all."

Now based in <a href="Battersea">Battersea</a>, Tyndall left Jordan and the NSM and formed his own rival, the <a href="Greater%20Britain%20Movement">Greater Britain Movement</a> (GBM). According to Tyndall, "the Greater Britain Movement will uphold, and preach, pure National Socialism". According to the political scientist Stan Taylor, the GBM reflected Tyndall's desire for "a specifically British variant of National Socialism". It called for the criminalisation of sexual relations and marriages between white Britons and non-whites and called for the sterilisation of those it deemed unfit to reproduce. The group established its base in a run-down building in Notting Hill, with swastikas being sprayed onto the exterior and an image of Hitler decorating the interior. Tyndall tried to convince the WUNS to accept his GBM as its British representative, but Rockwell—concerned not to encourage schismatic dissenters in his own <a href="American%20Nazi%20Party">American Nazi Party</a>—sided with Jordan and the NSM. Tyndall then established contact with Rockwell's main rival in the American neo-Nazi scene, the <a href="National%20States%27%20Rights%20Party">National States' Rights Party</a>. 

Tyndall also a publishing company called Albion Press, and launched a new magazine, which he titled "Spearhead" after his former paramilitary group. "Spearhead" initially labelled itself "an organ of National Socialist opinion in Britain" and described Nazi Germany as "one of the greatest social experiments of our century". According to the historian <a href="Alan%20Sykes">Alan Sykes</a>, this magazine became "increasingly influential" in the British far-right. The magazine advertised portraits of Hitler and swastika badges for sale. Much of the material that Tyndall wrote for the journal was less openly neo-Nazi and extreme than his previous writings, something which may have resulted from caution surrounding the <a href="Race%20Relations%20Act%201965">Race Relations Act 1965</a>. The GBM engaged in several stunts to raise publicity; in 1964 for instance Webster assaulted the Kenyan leader <a href="Jomo%20Kenyatta">Jomo Kenyatta</a> outside his London hotel while Tyndall hurled insults at him through a loudspeaker. In 1965, the group staged a shooting incident at its <a href="Norwood%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Norwood</a> headquarters, claiming that it had been an attack by anti-fascists. In another instance they distributed stickers emblazoned with a portrait of Hitler and the slogan "he was right". In 1966, several GBM members were arrested for carrying out arson attacks against <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>s.

In the mid-1960s, there were five extreme-right groups operating in Britain, and Tyndall believed that they could achieve more if they united. To that end, "Spearhead" abandoned its open affiliation with neo-Nazism in 1966. That year, Tyndall issued a pamphlet titled "Six Principles of British Nationalism" which made no mention of neo-Nazism or Jewish conspiracies. It also dropped the insistence on armed takeovers present in his earlier thought, acknowledging the possibility that extreme-right nationalists could gain power through the British electoral process. Chesterton read the pamphlet and was impressed, entering into talks with Tyndall's GBM about a potential merger of their respective organisations. Independently, Chesterton had also been discussing the issue of a unification with Bean's BNP. This proved successful, as the LEL and BNP merged to form the <a href="National%20Front%20%28UK%29">National Front</a> (NF) in 1967. According to Thurlow, the formation of the NF was "the most significant event on the radical right and fascist fringe of British politics" since the internment of the country's fascists during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

The new NF initially excluded Tyndall and his GBM from joining, concerned that he might seek to mould it in a specifically neo-Nazi direction, although they soon agreed to allow both him and other GBM members to join on probation. On entering, the former GBM soon became the most influential faction within the NF, with many of its members rapidly rising to positions of influence. Tyndall became the party's vice chairman and remained loyal to Chesterton, who was the party's first chairman, for instance by supporting him when several members of the party directorate rebelled against his leadership in 1970. Although remaining Tyndall's private property, "Spearhead" became the "de facto" monthly magazine of the NF. Chesterton resigned as chairman in 1970, and was replaced by the <a href="Powellism">Powellite</a> <a href="John%20O%27Brien%20%28UK%20politician%29">John O'Brien</a>. In 1972, O'Brien and eight other members of the party's directorate resigned in protest at Tyndall's links to neo-Nazi groups in Germany. This allowed Tyndall to take control as party chairman in 1972.

According to Thurlow, under Tyndall the NF represented "an attempt to portray the essentials of Nazi ideology in more rational language and seemingly reasonable arguments", functioning as an attempt to "convert racial populists" angry about immigration "into fascists". Capitalising on anger surrounding the arrival of <a href="Expulsion%20of%20Asians%20from%20Uganda">Ugandan Asian</a> migrants in the country in 1972, Tyndall oversaw the NF during the period of its largest growth. Membership of the party doubled between October 1972 and June 1973, possibly reaching as high as 17,500.
Relations had apparently warmed between Tyndall and Jordan, for they met up after the latter was released from prison in 1968, and Tyndall again met with Jordan in <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a> in 1972 and invited him to join the NF. A poor showing in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%20February%201974">February 1974 general election</a> resulted in Tyndall being challenged by two groups within the party, the '<a href="Strasserism">Strasserites</a>' and the '<a href="Right-wing%20populism">Populists</a>', the latter of whom were largely Powellite ex-members of the Conservative Party. The Populist challenge was successful and in October 1974 Tyndall was replaced as chairman by <a href="John%20Kingsley%20Read">John Kingsley Read</a>. Tyndall then used "Spearhead" as a vehicle to criticise rival factions with the NF. As a result, he was expelled from the party during a disciplinary tribunal in November 1975. Tyndall took the issue to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">high court</a>, who overturned the expulsion. The 'Populists' then left the party, splitting to form the <a href="National%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201976%29">National Party</a> in January 1976, which for a short time proved more electorally successful than the NF. Back in the party and with his main rivals gone, Tyndall regained the position of chairman.

Encouraged by Webster and new confidante <a href="Richard%20Verrall">Richard Verrall</a>, in the mid-1970s Tyndall returned to his openly hardline approach of promoting <a href="biological%20racism">biological racist</a> and antisemitic ideas. This did not help the NF's electoral prospects. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201979">1979 general election</a>, the NF mounted the largest challenge of any insurgent party since the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201918">in 1918</a>, with 303 candidates. Among them were Tyndall's wife, mother-in-law, and father-in-law. Tyndall stood in <a href="Hackney%20South%20and%20Shoreditch%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Hackney South and Shoreditch</a>, securing 7.6%; this was the Front's best result that election, but was down from the 9.4% they had gained in that constituency in October 1974. In the election, the NF "flopped dismally", securing only 1.3% of the total vote, down from 3.1% in October 1974. This decline may have been due to the increased anti-fascist campaigning of the previous few years, or because the Conservative Party under <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> had adopted an increasingly tough stance on immigration which attracted many of the votes that had previously gone to the NF. NF membership had also declined, and by 1979 had fallen to approximately 5,000. Tyndall nevertheless refused to dilute or moderate his party's policies, stating that to do so would be the "naïve chasing of moonbeams". In November 1979, Fountaine unsuccessfully tried to oust Tyndall as leader, subsequently establishing the <a href="National%20Front%20Constitutional%20Movement">National Front Constitutional Movement</a>.

Tyndall had grown distant from Webster over their differences, and in the late 1970s began blaming him for the party's problems. Webster had for instance disagreed with Tyndall's support for Chesterton's leadership, while Tyndall was upset with Webster's attempts to encourage more <a href="skinhead">skinhead</a>s and <a href="football%20hooliganism">football hooligans</a> to join the party. Tyndall in particular began criticizing the fact that Webster was a <a href="homosexuality">homosexual</a>, emphasising allegations that Webster had been making sexual advances toward young men in the party. More widely, he complained about a "homosexual network" among leading NF members. In October 1979, he called a meeting of the NF directorate at which he urged them to call for Webster's resignation. At the meeting, Webster apologised for his conduct, and the directorate stood by him against Tyndall. Angered, Tyndall then tried convincing the directorate to grant him greater powers in his position as chairman, but they refused. Tyndall resigned in January 1980, subsequently referring to the party as the "gay National Front".

In June 1980, Tyndall founded the <a href="New%20National%20Front">New National Front</a> (NNF). The NNF claimed that a third of the NF's membership defected to join them. Tyndall stated that "I have one wish in this operation and one wish alone, to cleanse the National Front of the foul stench of perversion which has politically crippled it". As his choice of party name suggested, he remained hopeful that his breakaway group could eventually be re-merged back into the NF. There developed a great rivalry between the two groups, and as the NF's new leadership moved it away from the Tyndallite approach, Tyndall realised that he may never have the opportunity to regain his position within it.

In January 1981, Tyndall was contacted by far-right activist <a href="Ray%20Hill">Ray Hill</a>, who had become an informant for the anti-fascist magazine "<a href="Searchlight%20%28magazine%29">Searchlight</a>". Hill suggested that Tyndall establish a new political party through which he could unite many smaller extreme-right groups. While Hill's real intention had been to cause a further schism among the British far-right and thus weaken it, Tyndall deemed his suggestion to be a good idea. Tyndall made suggestions of unity to a number of other small extreme-right groups and together they established a Committee for Nationalist Unity (CNU) in January 1982. 

In March 1982 the CNU held a conference at <a href="Charing%20Cross%20Hotel">Charing Cross Hotel</a> in central London, and while the NF officially refused to send a delegation, several NF members did attend. The fifty extreme-rightists in attendance agreed that they would establish a new political party, to be known as the <a href="British%20National%20Party">British National Party</a> (BNP). According to Tyndall, "The BNP is a racial nationalist party which believes in Britain for the British, that is to say racial separatism." Under Tyndall's leadership, in 1982 the BNP issued its first policy on immigration as "immigration into Britain by non-Europeans ... should be terminated forthwith, and we should organise a massive programme of repatriation and resettlement overseas of those peoples of non-European origin already resident in this country."

Tyndall was to be the leader of this new party, with the majority of its members coming from the NNF, although others were defectors from the NF, <a href="British%20Movement">British Movement</a>, <a href="British%20Democratic%20Party">British Democratic Party</a>, and <a href="Constitutional%20Movement">Nationalist Party</a>. The party was formerly launched at a press conference held in a <a href="Victoria%2C%20London">Victoria</a> hotel on 7 April 1982. At the conference, Tyndall described the BNP as the "SDP of the far right", thereby referencing the recent growth of the centrist <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28UK%29">Social Democratic Party</a>. The historian Nigel Copsey has noted that while the BNP under Tyndall could be described as "Neo-Nazi", it was not "crudely mimetic" of the original German Nazism. Its stated policy objectives were identical to those that the NF had had under Tyndall's leadership in the 1970s. But its constitution was very different. Whereas the NF had a directorate which helped to guide the direction of the party and could replace the leader, Tyndall's new BNP gave full executive powers to the chairman. Tyndall ran the BNP from his home, "Seacroft", in <a href="Hove">Hove</a>, <a href="East%20Sussex">East Sussex</a>, and he rarely left the county. 
In 1986 Tyndall was convicted of <a href="Incitement%20to%20ethnic%20or%20racial%20hatred">inciting racial hatred</a> and sentenced to a year's imprisonment, although he served only four months before his release. In 1987, the BNP opened discussions with an NF faction, the National Front Support Group (NFSG), to discuss the possibility of a merger, but the NFSG decided against it, remaining cautious about Tyndall's total domination of the BNP.

By 1988, "Searchlight" reported that the party's membership had declined to around 1,000. Tyndall responded by trying to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He also promised that he would make the BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK and that he would establish a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a party headquarters was opened in <a href="Welling">Welling</a>, <a href="South%20East%20%28London%20sub%20region%29">Southeast London</a>, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant '<a href="white%20flight">white flight</a>' from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent force on the British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.

In the early 1990s, a paramilitary group known as <a href="Combat%2018">Combat 18</a> (C18) was formed to protect BNP events from anti-fascist protesters. Tyndall was displeased that by 1992, C18 was having an increased influence over the BNP's street activities. Relations between the groups deteriorated such that by August 1993, activists from the BNP and C18 were physically fighting each other. In December 1993, Tyndall issued a bulletin to BNP branches declaring C18 to be a proscribed organisation, furthermore suggesting that it may have been established by agents of the state to discredit the party. To counter C18's influence, he secured the American white nationalist militant <a href="William%20Luther%20Pierce">William Pierce</a> as a guest speaker at the BNP's annual rally in November 1995.

Tyndall had observed the electoral success achieved by <a href="Jean-Marie%20Le%20Pen">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a> and the French <a href="National%20Front%20%28France%29">National Front</a> during the 1980s, and hoped that by learning from their activities he could improve the BNP's electoral prospects. He saw the issue as being one of credibility among the electorate, declaring that "we should be looking for ways to overcome our present image of weakness and smallness". He ignored the significant impact that had been achieved by the French NF through moderating its policies and thereby gaining greater <a href="respectability">respectability</a> among the electorate. While Tyndall had sought to keep skinheads and football hooligans out of the BNP, he still kept a range of <a href="Holocaust%20denial">Holocaust deniers</a> and convicted criminals close to him. He expressed the view that "we should not be looking for ways of applying ideological cosmetic surgery to ourselves in order to make our features more appealing to our public". Conversely, in the early 1990s a 'moderniser' faction emerged in the party that favoured a more electorally palatable strategy and an emphasis on building grassroots support to win local elections. They were impressed by Le Pen's move to disassociate his party from biological racism and focus on the perceived cultural incompatibility of different racial groups. Tyndall opposed many of the modernisers' ideas and sought to stem their growing influence in the party,

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201992">1992 general election</a>, the party stood 13 candidates. Tyndall stood in <a href="Bow%20and%20Poplar%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Bow and Poplar</a>, gaining 3% of the vote.
At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%201993">1993 local elections</a>, the BNP gained one council seat—won by <a href="Derek%20Beackon">Derek Beackon</a> in the East London neighbourhood of <a href="Millwall">Millwall</a>—after a campaign that targeted the anger of local whites over the perceived preferential treatment received by Bangladeshi migrants in <a href="social%20housing">social housing</a>.
At the time Tyndall described this as the BNP's "moment in history", deeming it a sign that the party was entering the political mainstream. Following an anti-BNP campaign launched by anti-fascist and local religious groups it lost its Millwall seat during the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%201994">1994 local elections</a>.

Tyndall stood as the BNP candidate in the <a href="Dagenham%20by-election%2C%201994">1994 Dagenham by-election</a>, in which he gained 9% of the vote and had his <a href="Deposit%20%28politics%29">electoral deposit</a> returned. This was the first time that an extreme right candidate had retained their deposit since Webster's 1973 showing for the NF in <a href="West%20Bromwich%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">West Bromwich</a>. 
In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201997">1997 general election</a>, the party stood over fifty candidates. Tyndall stood in the East London constituency of <a href="Poplar%20and%20Canning%20Town%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Poplar and Canning Town</a>, where he received 7.26% of the vote. Tyndall claimed that following the election, the party received between 2,500 and 3,000 enquiries—roughly the same as they had received after the 1983 general election—although far fewer of these enquirers became members.
The party was stagnating, and Tyndall's "political career was now on borrowed time".

After the BNP's poor performance at the 1997 general election, opposition to Tyndall's leadership grew. His position was damaged by a lack of financial transparency in the party, with concerns being raised that large donations to the party had been used instead by Tyndall for personal expenses. The modernisers challenged his control of the party, resulting in its first ever leadership election, held in October 1999. Tyndall was challenged by <a href="Nick%20Griffin">Nick Griffin</a>, who offered an improved administration, financial transparency, and greater support for local branches. 80% of party members voted, with two-thirds backing Griffin; Tyndall had secured only 411 votes, representing 30% of the total membership. Tyndall accepted his defeat with equanimity and stood down as chairman. He stated that he would become "an ordinary member", telling his supporters that "we have all got to pull together in the greater cause of race and nation".

Tyndall remained a member of the BNP and continued to support it in the pages of "Spearhead". But Griffin sought to restrain Tyndall's ongoing influence in the party, curtailing the distribution of "Spearhead" among BNP members and instead emphasising his own magazine, "Identity", which was established in January 2000. To combat the influence of declining sales, Tyndall established the group 'Friends of "Spearhead"', whose members were asked to contribute £10 a month.

By 2000, Tyndall was beginning to agitate against Griffin's leadership, criticising the establishment of the party's Ethnic Liaison Committee — which had one half-Turkish member (Lawrence Rustem) — as a move towards admitting non-whites into the party. He was also critical of Griffin's abandonment of the party's compulsory removal of migrants and non-whites from the country, believing that if they stayed in a segregated system then Britain would resemble <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>-era South Africa, which he did not think was preferable. His main criticisms were focused not on the party's changing direction, but on Griffin's character itself, portraying him as unscrupulous and self-centred. Tyndall was determined to retake control of the party, and in this was supported by a group of party hardliners. During a proposed leadership challenge, Tyndall put forward his name, although withdrew it following the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202001">2001 general election</a> when Griffin led the BNP to a clear growth in electoral support. Tyndall nevertheless believed that the BNP's electoral success had less to do with Griffin's reforms and more to do with external factors such as the <a href="2001%20Oldham%20riots">2001 Oldham riots</a>. In turn, Griffin criticised Tyndall in the pages of "Identity", claiming that the latter was committed to "the sub-Mosleyite wackiness of <a href="Arnold%20Leese">Arnold Leese's</a> Imperial Fascist League and the Big Government mania of the 1930s". Griffin expelled Tyndall from the party in August 2003, but had to allow his return following an out-of-court settlement shortly after.

Tyndall gave a speech at a BNP event in which he claimed that Asians and Africans had only produced "black magic, witchcraft, voodoo, cannibalism and Aids", also attacking the Jewish leader of the Conservative Party, <a href="Michael%20Howard">Michael Howard</a>, as an "interloper, this immigrant or son of immigrants, who has no roots at all in Britain". The speech was filmed by undercover investigator <a href="Jason%20Gwynne">Jason Gwynne</a> and included in a 2004 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> documentary, "The Secret Agent". On 12 December 2004, these comments resulted in Tyndall being arrested on suspicion of incitement to racial hatred. That month, Tyndall was again expelled from the BNP, this time permanently. The police then charged him, although he was granted unconditional bail in April 2005. Tyndall died of heart failure at his flat—52 Westbourne Villas in Hove—on 19 July 2005. He had been due to stand trial at <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> Magistrates' Court two days later. He was survived by his wife and his daughter, Marina.

Tyndall has been described as a <a href="ethnic%20nationalism">racial nationalist</a>, and a British nationalist, as well as a <a href="fascism">fascist</a>, <a href="neo-fascism">neo-fascist</a>, and a neo-Nazi. Tyndall adhered to neo-Nazism during the 1960s, although from the 1970s onward he increasingly concealed this behind the rhetoric of "British patriotism". According to Thurlow, this was because by this time Tyndall had realised that "open Nazism was counter-productive" to his cause. This was in accordance with a wider trend among Britain's far-right to avoid the term "British fascism", with its electorally unpalatable connotations, and instead refer to "British nationalism" in its public appeals. Sykes stated that Tyndall split with Jordan because—in contrast to the latter's neo-Nazi focus on pan-'Aryan' unity—he "thought more traditionally in terms of British nationalism, the British race and the British Empire". Jordan himself accused Tyndall of being "an extreme Tory imperialist, a <a href="John%20Bull">John Bull</a>, unable to recognise the call of race beyond Britain's frontiers".

Tyndall later described his membership of these openly neo-Nazi groups as a "youthful indiscretion". He expressed the view that while he regretted his involvement in them, he was not ashamed of having done so: "though some of my former beliefs were mistaken, I will never acknowledge that there was anything dishonourable about holding them." As leader of the NF he continued to openly approve of Hitler's social and economic programme and well as his policies of German territorial expansion. In his 1988 autobiography "The Eleventh Hour", he stated that while he thought that "many of [Hitler's] intentions were good ones and many of his achievements admirable", he did not think "that it is right for a British movement belonging to an entirely different phase of history to model itself on the movement of Hitler".

Following this shift away from overt allegiance to Nazism, Tyndall's supporters and detractors continued to dispute whether he remained a convinced Nazi. Academic commentators consider that his basic ideological world-view did not change. In 1981, Nigel Fielding stated that while Tyndall's views had "moderated remarkably", in the NF he had still "preserve[d] and defend[ed]" "those traits which were the hallmark" of earlier neo-Nazi groups. Walker noted that in October 1975 Tyndall wrote articles for "Spearhead" which had clearly "returned to the language and ideology of the Nazi days", and that another article printed the previous month was "pure Nazism in that it reflects exactly the mood and spirit of "Mein Kampf"." The historian <a href="Nicholas%20Goodrick-Clarke">Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke</a> stated that Tyndall simply "cloaked his former extremism in British nationalism", while the journalist <a href="Daniel%20Trilling">Daniel Trilling</a> commented that "Tyndall's claim to have moderated his views was merely expedient". On his death, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" stated that Tyndall had remained "a racist, violent neo-Nazi to the end", while Trilling described Tyndall as having had "a long pedigree in the most extreme and violent quarters of Britain's far right".

The political scientist Nigel Copsey believed that Chesterton had been the "seminal influence" on Tyndall's thought. Thurlow disagreed, arguing that Tyndall had been influenced less by Chesterton and Mosley and more by a third figure in Britain's "fascist tradition", <a href="Arnold%20Leese">Arnold Leese</a>. Thurlow noted that Tyndall adopted Leese's "political intransigence ... his refusal to compromise with political reality and his willingness to martyr himself for his beliefs". According to Trilling, the "two guiding stars in ... Tyndall's political universe" were Hitler and the British Empire. In contrast to many of his contemporaries in the British far-right, Tyndall was "thoroughly indifferent" to the ideas of the <a href="Nouvelle%20Droite">Nouvelle Droite</a>, a French extreme-right movement which had emerged in the 1960s. Whereas the Nouvelle Droite sought to move away from the approach adopted by the fascist movements of the 1930s and 1940s, Tyndall remained wedded to white racial nationalism, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and nostalgia for the British Empire, all approaches generally repudiated by the Nouvelle Droite.

Tyndall had "deeply entrenched" <a href="scientific%20racism">biologically racist</a> views, akin to those of earlier fascists like Hitler and Leese. He believed that there was a biologically distinct white-skinned "British race" which was one branch of a wider <a href="Nordic%20race">Nordic race</a>. Tyndall was of the view that race defined a nation and that "if that is lost we will have no nation in the future." He believed the Nordic race to be superior to others, and under his leadership, the BNP promoted a variety of <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscientific</a> claims in support of <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacy</a>. Those parties he controlled restricted membership to people of Northern European ethnic heritage. 

Over the course of his career in far-right politics, Tyndall became less outspoken on race after his prosecution under the race relations legislation. In the mid-1970s, Tyndall used "Spearhead" to claim that "the negro has a smaller brain and a much less complex cerebral structure" than white Europeans. In 1988, Tyndall described his crime as having "dared to publish an honest and frank opinion on the relative merits of Whites and Negroes." Tyndall argued that non-whites were unassimilable to Britain and that those living in Britain should be repatriated. Tyndall strongly objected to interracial relationships and <a href="miscegenation">miscegenation</a> and remarked in his book "The Eleventh Hour": "I feel deeply sorry for the child of a mixed marriage, but I can have no sympathy whatever for the parents ... They produced an offspring that will never wholly fit, and will undoubtedly face a life much harder than the normal person born of pure race." In contrast to his views on non-white migration, he spoke positively of white immigrants from Ireland, Poland, Hungary, and the Baltic states, regarding them as being racially similar and sharing the "same basic culture" as the British and were thus easily able to assimilate "within a generation or two". 

Tyndall was <a href="antisemitic">antisemitic</a>. From earlier fascists like Chesterton, he had inherited a belief that there was a global conspiracy of Jews bent on world domination, opining that the "<a href="Protocols%20of%20the%20Elders%20of%20Zion">Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a>" was genuine evidence for this. He believed that Jews were responsible for both <a href="communism">communism</a> and international finance capitalism, using both to their own ends, and that they were responsible for undermining the British Empire and the British race. Tyndall also believed that both democratic government and immigration into Europe were parts of a Jewish conspiracy to weaken other races. In an early edition of "Spearhead", he had expressed the view that "if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours to worry about ... It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. Do you hear me? THE JEWS?" Another of his comments, made in 1963, was that "Jewry is a world pest wherever it is found in the world today. The Jews are more clever and more financially powerful than other people and have to be eradicated before they destroy the Aryan peoples".

Tyndall also engaged in <a href="Holocaust%20denial">Holocaust denial</a>, declaring that the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> was a hoax created by Jews to gain sympathy for themselves and thus aid their plot for world domination. In "The Eleventh Hour", Tyndall spoke approvingly of Holocaust denier <a href="David%20Irving">David Irving</a>. In promoting Holocaust denial, Tyndall and those close to him may have been seeking to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazi government in the British public's view.

In the early 1960s, Tyndall espoused the idea of replacing Britain's liberal democratic government—which he regarded as a front for the Jewish world conspiracy—with an authoritarian system that he believed would be free of Jewish influence. Between 1961 and 1966 there was a shift in Tyndall's publicly espoused views. This focused largely on his beliefs about the structure of an ideal government for—while not rejecting the idea of an authoritarian dictatorship altogether—he placed greater emphasis on the need for the government to be more acceptable to the population. Rather than self-describing himself as an authoritarian, by the mid-1960s he was accusing the country's mainstream parties (and the "liberal minority" whom he alleged ran them) of being the real authoritarians, thus portraying himself as a champion of democracy. In this he presented his arguments in a <a href="populism">populist</a> manner.

Tyndall believed that liberal democracy was damaging to British society, claiming that liberalism was a "doctrine of decay and degeneration". Under Tyndall, the NF and BNP sought to dismantle the UK's liberal democratic system of parliamentary governance, although was vague about what they sought to replace this system with. In his 1988 work "The Eleventh Hour", Tyndall wrote of the need for "an utter rejection of liberalism and a dedication to the resurgence of authority". Tyndall's BNP perceived itself as a revolutionary force that would bring about a <a href="Palingenetic%20ultranationalism">national rebirth</a> in Britain, entailing a radical transformation of society. It proposed a state in which the Prime Minister would have full executive powers, and would be elected directly by the population for an indefinite period of time. This Prime Minister could be dismissed from office in a further election that could be called if Parliament passed a <a href="vote%20of%20no%20confidence">vote of no confidence</a>. It stated that rather than having any political parties, candidates standing for election to the parliament would be independent.

Tyndall described his approach to the economy as "National Economics", expressing the view that "politics must lead, and not be led by, economic forces". His approach rejected <a href="economic%20liberalism">economic liberalism</a> because it did not serve "the national interest", although still saw advantages in a <a href="capitalism">capitalist</a> system, looking favourably on individual enterprise. He called on capitalist elements to be combined with <a href="socialism">socialist</a> ones, with the government playing a role in planning the economy. He promoted the idea of the UK becoming an <a href="autarky">autarky</a> which was economically self-sufficient, with domestic production protected from foreign competition. This attitude was heavily informed by the <a href="corporatism">corporatist</a> system that had been introduced in <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>'s Fascist Italy.

Under Tyndall, the NF alleged that internationalist institutions and organisations were part of the global Jewish conspiracy. Under Tyndall's leadership, the BNP had overt anti-Europeanist tendencies, and throughout the 1980s and 1990s he maintained the party's opposition to the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a>. Arguing that Britain should establish a White Commonwealth bloc, Tyndall called for a better relationship with South Africa and Rhodesia, and urged those nations to permanently retain their systems of racial segregation. He claimed that "power and responsibility" should not be given to the indigenous Africans living in these countries because they were "ill-fitted to use [it] wisely". He expressed support for Hitler's "<a href="lebensraum">lebensraum</a>" policy of territorial expansion and claimed that the British race required something similar. In "The Eleventh Hour", he called for the British to re-colonise parts of Africa.

During Tyndall's period of leadership the BNP promoted <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>, calling for the forced sterilisation of those with genetically transmittable disabilities. In party literature, it talked of improving the British "racial stock" by removing "inferior strains within the indigenous races of the British Isles". In his magazine "Spearhead", Tyndall had stated that "sub-human elements", "perverts", and "asocials" should be eliminated from Britain through "the gas chamber system". When questioned as to whether Tyndall would seek to exterminate other races if he was in power, he denied it; although not objecting to said exterminations on moral grounds, he stated that such a programme would incur international unpopularity. It is unclear if these statements reflected his genuine views or were tactical justifications designed to not upset potential NF voters.

Tyndall presented himself as an <a href="agnosticism">agnostic</a> although expressed admiration for what he claimed were the moral values of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Tyndall called for a "complete moral regeneration of the national life". He objected to homosexuality and advocated for it to be outlawed, writing that "the literary and artistic products of the homosexual mind can only flourish in a society where heterosexual values have been gravely weakened." He expressed the view that the NF "was itself by no means immune to this sickening cult", and he disapproved of the presence of homosexuals in the party. Under Tyndall, the BNP called for the re-criminalisation of homosexual activity.

The American journalist George Thayer, who met with Tyndall in the 1960s, described him as being "blonde and balding", with "cold, evasive eyes". Thayer stated that Tyndall "had not the slightest spark of humour. He was suspicious, nervous, and excitable, and moved with all the stiffness of a Prussian in Court." In his study of the National Front, the journalist Martin Walker described Tyndall as giving off "an impression of absolute, if brittle, self control". Nigel Fielding, another to have studied the NF, described Tyndall as "a rather small man with a hard, unlined face and pale blue eyes. His movements are abrupt and energetic, and he speaks in a loud voice with a clipped inflection." Walker described him as having a "keen political mind", with a "concern for organisation [and] meticulous planning". Tyndall lived a life of temperance and regular exercise, and—according to Walker—his early morning runs had "long been a joke in Nationalist circles".

Thurlow thought that Tyndall's oratorical style was learned from Mosley's example, while Trilling instead believed that it was based on that of Hitler. According to Trilling, Tyndall's "speeches were pompous but studied ... [he] copied the hand gestures, the rising delivery that ended in a crescendo of angry epithets [from Hitler] ... But it was flat and tedious, like a provincial <a href="Physical%20education">PE</a> teacher trying to show his bored pupils how the rugby or football greats might have done it." After Tyndall's death, the BNP spokesman Phil Edwards said that "he was a marvellous speaker. He could hold a room and mesmerise them, but he did not have the answer to the problems." Copsey stated that "Tyndall may have been a rousing speaker, but his tactical intelligence and vision left much to be desired". The East London BNP activist Eddy Butler noted that at a 1986 party rally in <a href="Dewsbury">Dewsbury</a>, Tyndall "lost them completely. He knew how to talk to a small room of nationalists, but he didn't know how to talk to a thousand Yorkshire young geezers. He hadn't got a clue about normal people or normal politics. He'd go on about the Britain of <a href="Sir%20Francis%20Drake">Sir Francis Drake</a>; you'd think 'what's he on about?'".

Walker described Tyndall as being "very close to his mother", with whom he lived until 1977. On 19 November 1977 he married Valerie Dawn Olliff, a divorcee and fellow right-wing activist. The couple had a daughter named Marina.
Valerie died on 24 June 2011 in Hove.

Walker noted that during the 1960s, Tyndall was "well known" yet "unpopular within Nationalist circles because of his arrogance, his overbearing personal manner and the way he brought the authoritarianism of his politics into his personal life". In contrast, Fielding noted that within the NF of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tyndall's standing among "ordinary members" was "very high", with some of them even chanting his name during his speeches. At Tyndall's death, the anti-fascist activist Nick Lowles stated that Tyndall had been "someone that the more hardline nationalists" in the BNP "have always looked up to and rallied around" and that he "still had a lot of support" in the party, particularly in the northwest and parts of south London. Despite his standing within the British far-right, "The Telegraph" noted that Tyndall's devotion to neo-Nazism "prevented his cause from acquiring the slightest veneer of political respectability."

A Momentary Lapse of Reason

A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the thirteenth studio album by the English <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> band <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>. It was released in the UK and US on 7 September 1987 by <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI</a> and <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia</a>. It was recorded primarily on guitarist <a href="David%20Gilmour">David Gilmour</a>'s converted houseboat, "<a href="Astoria%20%28recording%20studio%29">Astoria</a>". Its production was marked by a legal dispute with former member <a href="Roger%20Waters">Roger Waters</a>, who departed in 1985, as to who owned the rights to the band's name, an issue resolved several months after the album was released.

Unlike much of their previous material, the record is not a <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a> and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters, following his decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new Pink Floyd album with drummer <a href="Nick%20Mason">Nick Mason</a> and keyboardist <a href="Richard%20Wright%20%28musician%29">Richard Wright</a>. The album was promoted with three singles: the double A-side "<a href="Learning%20to%20Fly%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Learning to Fly</a>" / "<a href="Terminal%20Frost">Terminal Frost</a>", "<a href="On%20the%20Turning%20Away">On the Turning Away</a>", and "<a href="One%20Slip">One Slip</a>", as well as a world tour.

"A Momentary Lapse of Reason" received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the production and instrumentation but criticized Gilmour's writing, and was derided by Waters. Despite this, it outsold the band's previous album, reaching number three in the UK and US. Since then, it has sold nearly 5 million copies.

After the release of Pink Floyd's 1983 album "<a href="The%20Final%20Cut%20%28album%29">The Final Cut</a>", viewed by some as a "de facto" solo record by bassist and songwriter <a href="Roger%20Waters">Roger Waters</a>, the band members worked on solo projects. Guitarist <a href="David%20Gilmour">David Gilmour</a> expressed feelings about his strained relationship with Waters on his second solo album, "<a href="About%20Face%20%28album%29">About Face</a>" (1984), and finished the accompanying tour as Waters began touring to promote his debut solo album, "<a href="The%20Pros%20and%20Cons%20of%20Hitch%20Hiking">The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking</a>". Although both had enlisted a range of successful performers, including in Waters' case <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, their solo acts attracted fewer fans than Pink Floyd; poor ticket sales forced Gilmour to cancel several concerts, and critic <a href="David%20Fricke">David Fricke</a> felt that Waters' show was "a petulant echo, a transparent attempt to prove that Roger Waters "was" Pink Floyd". Waters returned to the US in March 1985 with a second tour, this time without the support of <a href="Columbia%20Records">CBS Records</a>, which had expressed its preference for a new Pink Floyd album; Waters criticised the corporation as "a machine".

After drummer <a href="Nick%20Mason">Nick Mason</a> attended one of Waters' London performances in 1985, he found he missed touring under the Pink Floyd name. His visit coincided with the release in August of his second solo album, "<a href="Profiles%20%28Nick%20Mason%20and%20Rick%20Fenn%20album%29">Profiles</a>", on which Gilmour sang. With a shared love of aviation, Mason and Gilmour were taking flying lessons and together bought a <a href="de%20Havilland%20Dove">de Havilland Dove</a> aeroplane. Gilmour was working on other collaborations, including a performance for <a href="Bryan%20Ferry">Bryan Ferry</a> at 1985's <a href="Live%20Aid">Live Aid</a> concert, and co-produced the <a href="The%20Dream%20Academy">Dream Academy</a>'s <a href="The%20Dream%20Academy%20%28album%29">self-titled debut album</a>.

In December 1985, Waters announced that he had left Pink Floyd, which he believed was "a spent force creatively". After the failure of his "About Face" tour, Gilmour hoped to continue with the Pink Floyd name. The threat of a lawsuit from Gilmour, Mason and CBS Records was meant to compel Waters to write and produce another Pink Floyd album with his bandmates, who had barely participated in making "The Final Cut"; Gilmour was especially critical of the album, labelling it "cheap filler" and "meandering rubbish". The lawsuit left Waters with only one other option: to formally resign from Pink Floyd in order to protect himself from a lawsuit that, he said, "would have wiped me out completely".

According to Gilmour, "I told [Waters] before he left, 'If you go, man, we're carrying on. Make no bones about it, "we would carry on", and Roger replied: 'You'll never fucking do it.'" Waters had written to <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI</a> and <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia</a> declaring his intention to leave the group and asking them to release him from his contractual obligations. He also dispensed with the services of Pink Floyd manager <a href="Steve%20O%27Rourke">Steve O'Rourke</a> and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. This left Gilmour and Mason, in their view, free to continue with the Pink Floyd name.
In Waters' absence, Gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project. Months previously, keyboardist <a href="Jon%20Carin">Jon Carin</a> had jammed with Gilmour at his <a href="Hookend%20Recording%20Studios">Hookend studio</a>, where he composed the chord progression that became "<a href="Learning%20to%20Fly%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Learning to Fly</a>", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited <a href="Bob%20Ezrin">Bob Ezrin</a> (co-producer of 1979's "<a href="The%20Wall">The Wall</a>") to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, "<a href="Radio%20K.A.O.S.">Radio K.A.O.S.</a>", saying it was "far easier for Dave and I to do "our" version of a Floyd record". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as "mucking about with a lot of demos".

At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the new material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music "doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd". Gilmour later said that the new project was difficult without Waters. Gilmour had experimented with songwriters such as <a href="Eric%20Stewart">Eric Stewart</a> and <a href="Roger%20McGough">Roger McGough</a>, but eventually settled on <a href="Anthony%20Moore">Anthony Moore</a>, who was credited as co-writer of "Learning to Fly" and "On the Turning Away". Whereas many Pink Floyd albums were <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>s, Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link. By the end of that year, he had decided to make the material into a Pink Floyd project.

"A Momentary Lapse of Reason "was recorded in several different studios, mainly Gilmour's houseboat studio "<a href="Astoria%20%28recording%20studio%29">Astoria</a> "moored on the <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a>; according to Ezrin, "working there was just magical, so inspirational; kids sculling down the river, geese flying by ...". <a href="Andy%20Jackson%20%28recording%20engineer%29">Andy Jackson</a> was brought in to engineer. During sessions held between November 1986 and February 1987, Gilmour's band worked on new material, which in a marked change from previous Pink Floyd albums was recorded with a 24-track analogue machine and <a href="Overdubbing">overdubbed</a> onto a 32-track Mitsubishi digital recorder. This trend of using new technologies continued with the use of <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> synchronisation, aided by an Apple <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computer.

After agreeing to rework the material that Ralbovsky had found objectionable, Gilmour employed session musicians such as <a href="Carmine%20Appice">Carmine Appice</a> and <a href="Jim%20Keltner">Jim Keltner</a>. Both drummers, they replaced Mason on several songs; Mason was concerned that he was too out of practice to perform on the album, and instead busied himself with its sound effects. Some drum parts were also performed by <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a>s. During the sessions, Gilmour was asked by the wife of Pink Floyd's former keyboardist, <a href="Richard%20Wright%20%28musician%29">Richard Wright</a>, if he could contribute. A founding member of the band, Wright had left in 1979, and there were legal obstacles to his return, but after a meeting in Hampstead he was recruited as a paid musician on a weekly wage of $11,000. Gilmour said in an interview with author Karl Dallas that Wright's presence "would make us stronger legally and musically". However, his contributions were minimal; most of the keyboard parts had already been recorded, and so from February 1987 Wright played some background reinforcement on a <a href="Hammond%20organ">Hammond organ</a>, and a <a href="Rhodes%20piano">Rhodes piano</a>, and added vocal harmonies. He also performed a solo in "On the Turning Away", which was discarded, according to Wright, "not because they didn't like it ... they just thought it didn't fit." Gilmour later said: "Both Nick and Rick were catatonic in terms of their playing ability at the beginning. Neither of them played on this at all really. In my view, they'd been destroyed by Roger." Gilmour's comments angered Mason, who said: "I'd deny that I was catatonic. I'd expect that from the opposition, it's less attractive from one's allies. At some point, he made some sort of apology." Mason conceded that Gilmour was nervous about how the album would be perceived.
"Learning to Fly", with its lyrics of "circling sky, tongue-tied and twisted, just an earthbound misfit, I", was inspired by Gilmour's flying lessons, which occasionally conflicted with his studio duties. The track also contains a recording of Mason's voice during <a href="takeoff">takeoff</a>. The band experimented with <a href="Sampling%20%28signal%20processing%29">audio samples</a>, and Ezrin recorded the sound of Gilmour's boatman (Langley Iddens) rowing across the Thames. Iddens' presence at the sessions was made vital when "Astoria" began to lift in response to the rapidly rising river, which was pushing the boat against the pier on which it was moored.

"<a href="The%20Dogs%20of%20War%20%28song%29">The Dogs of War</a>" is a song about "physical and political mercenaries", according to Gilmour. Its creation came about through a mishap in the studio when a sampling machine began playing a sample of laughter, which Gilmour thought sounded like a dog's bark. "<a href="Terminal%20Frost">Terminal Frost</a>" was one of Gilmour's older demos, which he considered adding lyrics to but decided to leave as an instrumental. Conversely, the lyrics for "<a href="Sorrow%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20song%29">Sorrow</a>" were written before the music. The song's opening guitar solo was recorded in the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Memorial%20Sports%20Arena">Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena</a>. A 24-track mobile studio piped Gilmour's guitar tracks through a <a href="public%20address%20system">public address system</a>, and the resulting mix was then recorded in surround sound.

The sessions were interrupted by the escalating disagreement between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had the rights to the Pink Floyd name. O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued Waters for £25,000 of back-commission. In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to "the new Pink Floyd project". He immediately applied to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a> to prevent the Pink Floyd name from being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour's team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, Gilmour told a "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">Sunday Times</a>" reporter: "Roger is a <a href="The%20Dog%20in%20the%20Manger">dog in the manger</a> and I'm going to fight him, no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant."

Waters twice visited "Astoria", and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin; Ezrin later suggested that he was being "checked out". As Waters was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd Music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates. Recording moved to <a href="Mayfair%20Studios">Mayfair Studios</a> in February 1987, and from February to March – under the terms of an agreement with Ezrin to record close to his home – to <a href="A%26amp%3BM%20Records">A&M Studios</a> in Los Angeles: "It was fantastic because ... the lawyers couldn't call in the middle of recording unless they were calling in the middle of the night." The bitterness of the row between Waters and Pink Floyd was covered in a November 1987 issue of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", which became the magazine's best-selling issue of that year. The legal disputes were resolved out-of-court by the end of 1987.

Careful consideration was given to the album's title, with the initial three contenders being "Signs of Life", "Of Promises Broken" and "Delusions of Maturity". The final title appears as a line in the chorus of "<a href="One%20Slip">One Slip</a>".

For the first time since 1977's "<a href="Animals%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Animals</a>", designer <a href="Storm%20Thorgerson">Storm Thorgerson</a> was employed to work on a Pink Floyd studio <a href="album%20cover">album cover</a>. His finished design was a long river of <a href="hospital%20bed">hospital bed</a>s arranged on a beach, inspired by a phrase from "<a href="Yet%20Another%20Movie">Yet Another Movie</a>" and Gilmour's vague hint of a design that included a bed in a Mediterranean house, as well as "vestiges of relationships that have evaporated, leaving only echoes". The cover shows hundreds of hospital beds, placed on <a href="Saunton%20Sands">Saunton Sands</a> in <a href="Devon">Devon</a> (where some of the scenes for "<a href="Pink%20Floyd%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Wall">Pink Floyd – The Wall</a>" were filmed). The beds were arranged by Thorgerson's colleague Colin Elgie. A <a href="Hang%20gliding">hang glider</a> can be seen in the sky, a clear reference to "Learning to Fly". The photographer, Robert Dowling, won a gold award at the <a href="Association%20of%20Photographers%23Awards">Association of Photographers Awards</a> for the image, which took about two weeks to create. To drive home the message that Waters had left the band, the inner <a href="gatefold">gatefold</a> featured a group photograph – of just Gilmour and Mason – shot by <a href="David%20Bailey">David Bailey</a>. Its inclusion marked the first time since 1971's "<a href="Meddle">Meddle</a>" that a group photo had been used in the artwork of a Pink Floyd album. Richard Wright was represented only by name, on the credit list, although he also appears in photographs included in later reissues. 
"A Momentary Lapse of Reason" was released in the UK and US on 7 September 1987. It went straight to number three in both countries, held from the top spot by <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s "<a href="Bad%20%28album%29">Bad</a>" and <a href="Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a>'s <a href="Whitesnake%20%28album%29">self-titled album</a>.

In comparison with "The Final Cut", Gilmour presented "A Momentary Lapse" as a return to the Floyd of older days, citing his belief that towards the end of Waters' tenure, lyrics were more important than music. Gilmour said: ""<a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>" and "<a href="Wish%20You%20Were%20Here%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Wish You Were Here</a>" were so successful not just because of Roger's contributions, but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics [than on later albums.]" He added that with "A Momentary Lapse", he had tried to restore this earlier, more successful balance. Waters was scathing in his assessment of the new work, a view with which Wright later partly agreed, saying: "Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all."

Writing in "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" magazine, Phil Sutcliffe contended that it "does sound like a Pink Floyd album" and highlighted the two-part "A New Machine" as, variously, "a chillingly beautiful vocal exploration, a chorale of multitrack, echo and distortion broken into aching fragments by long moments of silence" and "[a] brilliant stroke of imagination". Sutcliffe concluded: ""A Momentary Lapse" is Gilmour's album to much the same degree that the previous four under Floyd's name were dominated by Waters … Clearly it wasn't only business sense and repressed ego but repressed talent which drove the guitarist to insist on continuing under the band brand-name." Recognising the return to the more music-oriented approach of Pink Floyd's classic works, "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>" said the album was "back over the wall to where diamonds are crazy, moons have dark sides, and mothers have atom hearts".

Conversely, <a href="Greg%20Quill">Greg Quill</a> of the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" wrote: "Something's missing here. This is, for all its lumbering weight, not a record that challenges and provokes as Pink Floyd should. A Momentary Lapse of Reason, sorry to say, is mundane, predictable." "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>" critic <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> opined: "In short, you'd hardly know the group's conceptmaster was gone – except that they put out noticeably fewer ideas." Writing more recently, for <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, William Ruhlmann refers to it as a "Gilmour solo album in all but name".

"A Momentary Lapse of Reason" was certified Silver and Gold in the UK on 1 October 1987, and Gold and Platinum in the US on 9 November. It went 2× Platinum on 18 January the following year, 3× Platinum on 10 March 1992, and 4× Platinum on 16 August 2001, easily outselling "The Final Cut". The album was reissued in 1988 as a limited-edition vinyl album, complete with posters, and a guaranteed ticket application for the band's upcoming UK concerts. The album was digitally remastered and re-released in 1994, and a tenth anniversary edition was issued in the US three years later. In 2011, "A Momentary Lapse" was again remastered for inclusion in the band's "<a href="Discovery%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20box%20set%29">Discovery</a>" box set; this time Wright's name had been restored as being a member of the band and the band photo (of Gilmour and Mason) has been removed in favour of additional artwork by StormStudios.

The decision to tour in support of the album was made before it was even complete. Early rehearsals were chaotic; Mason and Wright were completely out of practice, and realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge. Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters, and threatened to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs (Mason, separated from his wife, used his <a href="Ferrari%20250%20GTO">Ferrari 250 GTO</a> as collateral). Some promoters were offended by Waters' threat, and several months later 60,000 tickets went on sale in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, selling out within hours.

As the new line-up (with Wright) toured throughout North America, Waters' <a href="Radio%20K.A.O.S.%20%28tour%29">"Radio K.A.O.S." tour</a> was, on occasion, close by. The bassist had forbidden any members of Pink Floyd from attending his concerts, which were generally in smaller venues than those housing his former band's performances. Waters also issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the <a href="Pink%20Floyd%20pigs">flying pig</a>, and Pink Floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to the balloon's underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. By November 1987, Waters gave up, and on 23 December a legal settlement was finally reached at a meeting on "Astoria". Mason and Gilmour were allowed use of the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity, and Waters would be granted, among other things, rights to "The Wall". However, Waters claimed that they would never have the level of success that they had during his tenure again.
The "Momentary Lapse" tour was phenomenally successful. In every venue booked in the US it beat box office records, making it the most successful US tour by any band that year. Tours of Australia, Japan, and Europe soon followed, before the band returned twice to the US. Almost every venue was sold out. A live album, "<a href="Delicate%20Sound%20of%20Thunder">Delicate Sound of Thunder</a>", was released on 22 November 1988, followed in June 1989 by a concert video. A few days later, the live album was played in orbit, on board <a href="Soyuz%20TM-7">Soyuz TM-7</a>. The tour eventually came to an end by closing the <a href="Concerts%20at%20Knebworth%20House">Silver Clef Award Winners Concert</a>, at <a href="Knebworth%20Park">Knebworth Park</a> on 30 June 1990, after 200 performances, a gross audience of 4.25 million fans, and box office receipts of more than £60 million (not including merchandising).

Jason Voorhees () is the main <a href="character%20%28arts%29">character</a> from the <a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20%28franchise%29">"Friday the 13th" series</a>. He first appeared in "<a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20%281980%20film%29">Friday the 13th</a>" (1980) as the young son of camp cook-turned-killer <a href="Pamela%20Voorhees">Mrs. Voorhees</a>, in which he was portrayed by <a href="Ari%20Lehman">Ari Lehman</a>. Created by <a href="Victor%20Miller%20%28writer%29">Victor Miller</a>, with contributions by Ron Kurz, <a href="Sean%20S.%20Cunningham">Sean S. Cunningham</a> and <a href="Tom%20Savini">Tom Savini</a>, Jason was not originally intended to carry the series as the main <a href="antagonist">antagonist</a>. The character has subsequently been represented in various other media, including novels, video games, comic books, and <a href="Freddy%20vs.%20Jason">a crossover film</a> with another iconic horror film character, <a href="Freddy%20Krueger">Freddy Krueger</a>.

The character has primarily been an antagonist in the films, whether by stalking and killing the other characters, or acting as a psychological threat to the protagonist, as is the case in "". Since Lehman's portrayal, the character has been represented by numerous actors and <a href="stunt%20performer">stuntmen</a>, sometimes by more than one at a time; this has caused some controversy as to who should receive credit for the portrayal. <a href="Kane%20Hodder">Kane Hodder</a> is the best known of the stuntmen to portray Jason Voorhees, having played the character in four consecutive films.

The character's physical appearance has gone through many transformations, with various special makeup effects artists making their mark on the character's design, including makeup artist <a href="Stan%20Winston">Stan Winston</a>. Tom Savini's initial design has been the basis for many of the later incarnations. The trademark <a href="goaltender%20mask">hockey goalie mask</a> did not appear until "<a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20Part%20III">Friday the 13th Part III</a>". Since "", filmmakers have given Jason <a href="superhuman%20strength">superhuman strength</a>, regenerative powers, and near invulnerability. He has been seen as a sympathetic character, whose motivation for killing has been cited as being driven by the immoral actions of his victims and his own rage over having drowned as a child. Jason Voorhees has been featured in various humor magazines, referenced in feature films, parodied in television series, and was the inspiration for a <a href="horror%20punk">horror punk</a> band. Several toy lines have been released based on various versions of the character from the "Friday the 13th" films. Jason Voorhees's hockey mask is a widely recognized image in <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>.

Jason Voorhees first appears during a nightmare of the main character <a href="Alice%20%28Friday%20the%2013th%29">Alice Hardy</a> (<a href="Adrienne%20King">Adrienne King</a>) in the original "Friday the 13th" film; he becomes the main antagonist of the series in its sequels. As well as the films, there have been books and comics that have either <a href="expanded%20universe">expanded the universe</a> of Jason, or been based on a minor aspect of him.

Jason made his first cinematic appearance in the original "<a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20%281980%20film%29">Friday the 13th</a>" on May 9, 1980. In this film, Jason is portrayed in the memories of his mother, <a href="Pamela%20Voorhees">Mrs. Voorhees</a> (<a href="Betsy%20Palmer">Betsy Palmer</a>), and as a hallucination of the film's protagonist, <a href="Alice%20Hardy">Alice</a> (<a href="Adrienne%20King">Adrienne King</a>). Though the character makes no contemporary appearance onscreen, he propels the film's plot—Mrs. Voorhees, the cook at Camp Crystal Lake, seeks revenge for his death, which she blames on the camp counselors. Jason's second appearance was in the sequel, "<a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20Part%202">Friday the 13th Part 2</a>" (1981). Revealed to be alive, an adult Jason exacts revenge on Alice for decapitating his mother in the original film. Jason (<a href="Steve%20Daskewisz">Steven Dash</a> and Warrington Gillette), returns to Crystal Lake, living there as a <a href="hermit">hermit</a> and guarding it from all intruders. Five years later a group of teenagers arrive to set up a new camp, only to be murdered one by one by Jason, who wears a sack over his head to hide his face. <a href="Ginny%20%28Friday%20the%2013th%29">Ginny</a> (<a href="Amy%20Steel">Amy Steel</a>), the <a href="Final%20girl">lone survivor</a>, finds a makeshift shack in the woods with a shrine built around the severed head of Mrs. Voorhees, and surrounded by corpses. Ginny fights back and slams a machete through Jason's shoulder. He is left incapacitated as Ginny is taken away in an ambulance. In "<a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20Part%20III">Friday the 13th Part III</a>" (1982), Jason (<a href="Richard%20Brooker">Richard Brooker</a>) escapes to a nearby lake resort, Higgins Haven, to rest from his wounds.

Chris fends off Jason by slamming an axe into his head, but the night's events drive her into hysteria as the police take her away.

"" (1984) continues the story, with a presumed-dead Jason (<a href="Ted%20White%20%28stuntman%29">Ted White</a>) found by the police and taken to the morgue. Jason awakens at the morgue to kill an attendant and a nurse, and makes his way back to Crystal Lake. A group of teens renting a house there fall victim to Jason's rampage. Jason then seeks out <a href="List%20of%20Friday%20the%2013th%20characters%23Trish%20Jarvis">Trish</a> (<a href="Kimberly%20Beck">Kimberly Beck</a>) and <a href="Tommy%20Jarvis">Tommy Jarvis</a> (<a href="Corey%20Feldman">Corey Feldman</a>) next door.

Jason's body was supposedly cremated after Tommy killed him. <a href="List%20of%20Friday%20the%2013th%20characters%23Roy%20Burns">Roy Burns</a> (Dick Wieand) uses Jason's persona to become a <a href="Copycat%20crimes">copycat</a> killer at the halfway home to which Tommy was moved. Jason appears in the film only through Tommy's dreams and hallucinations. In "" (1986), Tommy (<a href="Thom%20Mathews">Thom Mathews</a>), who has run away from a mental institution, visits Jason's grave and learns that Jason's body was never actually cremated, but buried in a cemetery near Crystal Lake. While attempting to destroy his body, Tommy inadvertently resurrects Jason (<a href="C.%20J.%20Graham">C. J.

"<a href="Jason%20X">Jason X</a>" (2002) marked Kane Hodder's last performance as Jason. The film starts off in 2010; Jason has returned after another unexplained resurrection. Captured by the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. government</a> in 2008, Jason is being experimented upon in a research facility, where it has been determined that he has regenerative capabilities and that <a href="Cryopreservation">cryonic suspension</a> is the only possible solution to stop him, since numerous attempts to execute him have proved unsuccessful. Jason escapes, killing all but one of his captors, and slices through the cryo-chamber, spilling cryonics fluid into the room, freezing himself and the only other survivor, <a href="List%20of%20Friday%20the%2013th%20characters%23Rowan%20LaFontaine">Rowan</a> (<a href="Lexa%20Doig">Lexa Doig</a>).

The identity of the winner is left ambiguous, as Jason surfaces from the lake holding Freddy's severed head, which winks and laughs. 

In the 2009 <a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20%282009%20film%29">"Friday the 13th" reboot</a>, young Jason (Caleb Guss) witnesses his mother's (<a href="Nana%20Visitor">Nana Visitor</a>) beheading as a child and follows in her footsteps, killing anyone who comes to Crystal Lake. The adult Jason (<a href="Derek%20Mears">Derek Mears</a>) kidnaps <a href="List%20of%20Friday%20the%2013th%20characters%23Whitney%20Miller">Whitney Miller</a> (<a href="Amanda%20Righetti">Amanda Righetti</a>), a girl who looks like his mother, and holds her prisoner in his underground tunnels.

Eventually, Whitney uses Jason's devotion to his mother against him, stabbing him with his own machete while he is distracted when she appears. When his body is dumped into the lake, Jason emerges from the water to grab Whitney and their fates are left unknown.

Jason first appeared outside of film in the 1982 <a href="novelization">novelization</a> of "Friday the 13th Part 3" by <a href="Michael%20Avallone">Michael Avallone</a>. Avallone chose to use an alternate ending, which was filmed for "Part 3" but never used, as the ending for his 1982 adaptation. In the alternate film ending, Chris, who is in the canoe, hears Rick's voice and immediately rushes back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason is standing there with a machete, and he decapitates her. Jason next appears in print in the 1986 novelization of "Jason Lives" by <a href="Simon%20Hawke">Simon Hawke</a>, who also adapted the first three films in 1987 and 1988. "Jason Lives" specifically introduced <a href="List%20of%20Friday%20the%2013th%20characters%23Elias%20Voorhees">Elias Voorhees</a>, Jason's father, a character that was slated to appear in the film but was cut by the studio. In the novel, instead of being cremated, Elias has Jason buried after his death.

Jason made his <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> debut in the 1993 adaptation of "Jason Goes to Hell", written by <a href="Andy%20Mangels">Andy Mangels</a>. The three-issue series was a condensed version of the film, with a few added scenes that were never shot. Jason made his first appearance outside of the direct adaptations in "Satan's Six" No. 4, published in 1993, which is a continuation of the events of "Jason Goes to Hell". In 1995, <a href="Nancy%20A.%20Collins">Nancy A. Collins</a> wrote a three-issue, non-canonical miniseries involving a crossover between Jason and <a href="Leatherface">Leatherface</a>. The story involves Jason stowing away aboard a train, after being released from Crystal Lake when the area is drained due to heavy toxic waste dumping. Jason meets Leatherface, who adopts him into his family after the two become friends. Eventually they turn on each other. In 1994 four <a href="Young%20adult%20literature">young adult novels</a> were released under the title of "Friday the 13th". They did not feature Jason explicitly, but revolve around people becoming possessed by Jason when they put on his mask.

In 2003 and 2005, <a href="Black%20Flame%20%28publisher%29">Black Flame</a> published novelizations of "Freddy vs. Jason" and "Jason X" respectively. In 2005 they began publishing a new series of novels; one set was published under the "Jason X" title, while the second set utilized the "Friday the 13th" title. The "Jason X" series consisted of four sequels to the novelization of the film. "Jason X: The Experiment" was the first published. In this novel, Jason is being used by the government, who are trying to use his indestructibility to create their own army of "super soldiers". "Planet of the Beast" follows the efforts of Dr. Bardox and his crew as they try to clone the body of a comatose Jason, and shows their efforts to stay alive when Jason wakes from his coma. "Death Moon" revolves around Jason crash-landing at Moon Camp Americana. Jason is discovered below a prison site and unknowingly awakened in "To The Third Power". Jason has a son in this book, conceived through a form of <a href="artificial%20insemination">artificial insemination</a>.

On May 13, 2005, Avatar Press began releasing new "Friday the 13th" comics. The first, titled "Friday the 13th", was written by <a href="Brian%20Pulido">Brian Pulido</a> and illustrated by Mike Wolfer and Greg Waller. The story takes place after the events of "Freddy vs. Jason", where siblings Miles and Laura Upland have inherited Camp Crystal Lake. Knowing that Jason caused the recent destruction, Laura, unknown to her brother, sets out to kill Jason using a <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> group, so that she and her brother can sell the property. A three-issue miniseries titled "Friday the 13th: Bloodbath" was released in September 2005. Written by Brian Pulido and illustrated by Mike Wolfer and Andrew Dalhouse, the story involves a group of teenagers who come from Camp Tomorrow, a camp that sits on Crystal Lake, for work and a "party-filled weekend". The teenagers discover they share common family backgrounds, and soon awaken Jason, who hunts them. Brian Pulido returned for a third time in October 2005 to write "Jason X". Picking up after the events of the "Jason X" film, Über-Jason is now on Earth II where a biological engineer, Kristen, attempts to subdue Jason, in hopes that she can use his regenerative tissue to save her own life and the lives of those she loves. In February 2006 Avatar published "Friday the 13th: Jason vs. Jason X". Written and illustrated by Mike Wolfer, the story takes place after the events of the film "Jason X". A salvage team discovers the spaceship Grendel and awakens a regenerated Jason Voorhees. The "original" Jason and Über-Jason are drawn to each other, resulting in a battle to the death. In June 2006 a one-shot comic entitled "Friday the 13th: Fearbook" was released, written by Mike Wolfer with art by Sebastian Fiumara. The comic has Jason being captured and experimented upon by the Trent Organization; Jason escapes and seeks out Violet, the survivor of "Friday the 13th: Bloodbath", who is being contained by the Trent Organization in their Crystal Lake headquarters.

The "Friday the 13th" novella storyline was not connected to the "Jason X" series, and did not continue the stories set forth by the films, but furthered the character of Jason in its own way. "Friday the 13th: Church of the Divine Psychopath" has Jason resurrected by a religious cult. Jason is stuck in Hell, when recently executed serial killer Wayne Sanchez persuades Jason to help him return to Earth in "Friday the 13th: Hell Lake". In "Hate-Kill-Repeat", two religious serial killers attempt to find Jason at Crystal Lake, believing that the three of them share the same contempt for those that break the moral code. In "The Jason Strain", Jason is on an island with a group of convicts placed there by television executives running a reality game show. The character of Pamela Voorhees returns from the grave in "Carnival of Maniacs". Pamela is in search of Jason, who is now part of a traveling sideshow and about to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.

In December 2006 <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> <a href="imprint%20%28trade%20name%29">imprint</a> <a href="Wildstorm">Wildstorm</a> began publishing new comic books about Jason Voorhees under the "Friday the 13th" moniker. The first set was a six-issue miniseries involving Jason's return to Camp Crystal Lake, which is being renovated by a group of teenagers in preparation for its reopening as a tourist attraction. The series depicts various paranormal phenomena occurring at Crystal Lake. Jason's actions in this storyline are driven by the vengeful spirits of a Native American tribe wiped out on the lake by fur traders sometime in the 19th century. On July 11 and August 15, 2007, Wildstorm published a two-part special entitled "Friday the 13th: Pamela's Tale". The two-issue comic book covers Pamela Voorhees' journey to Camp Crystal Lake and the story of her pregnancy with Jason as she recounts it to hitchhiker Annie, a camp counselor who was killed in the original film. Wildstorm released another two-part special, entitled "Friday the 13th: How I Spent My Summer Vacation", that was released on September 12 and October 10, 2007. The comic book provides new insight into the psychology of Jason Voorhees as he befriends a boy born with a skull deformity. Wildstorm released a six-issue series called "<a href="Freddy%20vs.%20Jason%20vs.%20Ash">Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash</a>", starring the two killers and <a href="Ash%20Williams">Ash</a> from the "<a href="Evil%20Dead%20%28series%29">Evil Dead</a>" series. In this story, Freddy uses the "<a href="Necronomicon%20Ex-Mortis">Necronomicon</a>", which is in the Voorhees' basement, to escape from Jason's subconscious and "gain powers unlike anything he's had before". Freddy attempts to use Jason to retrieve the book, stating it will make him a real boy. Ash, who is working at the local S-Mart in Crystal Lake, learns of the book's existence and sets out to destroy it. Wildstorm released another two-issue miniseries on January 9 and February 13, 2008, titled "Friday the 13th: Bad Land", written and illustrated by Ron Marz and Mike Huddleston respectively. The miniseries features Jason stalking a trio of teenaged hikers taking shelter from a blizzard in Camp Crystal Lake.

A sequel to "Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash", subtitled "", was released by Wildstorm in 2009. Jason escapes from the bottom of Crystal Lake to resume his hunt for Ash, but is captured by the U.S. government. Freddy helps him escape and appoints him the general of his Deadite army, using the "Necronomicon" to heal his accumulated injuries and decomposition; it removes his natural deformities in the process. At the climax of the story, Jason battles his nemesis Tommy Jarvis and his great-niece <a href="List%20of%20Friday%20the%2013th%20characters%23Stephanie%20Kimble">Stephanie Kimble</a>; Stephanie impales him before Tommy decapitates him with a shard of glass. Jason's soul is then absorbed by Freddy, who uses it to increase his own power.

Initially created by Victor Miller, Jason's final design was a combined effort by Miller, Ron Kurz, and <a href="Tom%20Savini">Tom Savini</a>. The name "Jason" is a combination of "Josh" and "Ian", Miller's two sons, and "Voorhees" was inspired by a girl that Miller knew at high school whose last name was Van Voorhees. Miller felt it was a "creepy-sounding name", which was perfect for his character. Miller initially wrote Jason as a normal-looking child, but the crew behind the film decided he needed to be deformed. Victor Miller explained Jason was not meant to be a <a href="Creature%20from%20the%20Black%20Lagoon">creature from the "Black Lagoon"</a> in his script, and scripted Jason as a <a href="Developmental%20disability">mentally disabled</a> young boy; it was Savini who made Jason deformed. Ron Kurz confirmed that Miller's version of Jason was that of a normal child, but claims that it was his idea to turn Jason into a "mongoloid creature", and have him "jump out of the lake at the end of the film". Miller later agreed the ending would not have been as good if he looked like "<a href="Betsy%20Palmer">Betsy Palmer</a> at eight years old". Miller wrote a scene where Alice dreams she is attacked in a canoe by Jason, and then she wakes up in a hospital bed. Miller's intention was to get as close to "<a href="Carrie%20%281976%20film%29">Carrie</a>"s ending as possible. Savini believed having Jason pop out of the lake would be psychologically disturbing to the audience, and since Alice is supposed to be dreaming, the crew could get away with adding anything they wanted.

When it came time to cast the role of Jason, Ari Lehman, who had received a part in Sean Cunningham's "Manny's Orphans", arrived to read for the character of Jack. Before he could get started, Cunningham walked in and offered him a different part: Jason. Without having read a single word, Cunningham just looked at Ari and said, "You're the right size, you've got it." In the original "Friday the 13th", Ari Lehman is seen only in a brief flashback as the surprise ending. Subsequent actors who portrayed a young Jason include Timothy Burr Mirkovich in "Jason Takes Manhattan" and Spencer Stump in "Freddy vs. Jason". The adult role of Jason Voorhees has been played by various actors, some not credited, others taking great pride in their parts. Due to the physical demands the adult character requires, and the lack of emotional depth depicted, many of the actors since have been <a href="stunt%20double">stuntmen</a>. The most well known among them is Kane Hodder, who is cited as the best to play the role.

Many ideas were suggested for the sequel to "Friday the 13th", including making the title part of a serialized film series, where each succeeding film would be its own story and not related to any previous film under the "Friday the 13th" moniker. It was Phil Scuderi, one of the producers for the original film, who suggested bringing Jason back for the sequel. The director Steve Miner felt it was the obvious direction to take the series, as he felt the audience wanted to know more about the child who attacked Alice in the lake. Miner decided to pretend as if Alice did not see the "real Jason" in her dream, and Jason had survived his drowning as a boy and had grown up. After killing Jason in "The Final Chapter", it was the director Joseph Zito's intention to leave the door open for the studio to make more films with Tommy Jarvis as the main antagonist. Screenwriter Barney Cohen felt Jarvis would become a substitute for Jason, but the idea was never fully developed in "A New Beginning". Director and co-screenwriter Danny Steinmann disliked the idea of Jason not being the killer, but decided to use Tommy's fear of Jason as the primary story. This idea was immediately abandoned in "Jason Lives", when "A New Beginning" did not spark the "creative success" the studio was looking for. Executive producer Frank Mancuso Jr. wanted to bring Jason back, and he did not care how it was achieved. In yet another alteration of the series' continuity, Tom McLoughlin chose to ignore the idea that Jason had survived his drowning, instead presenting him as always having been some sort of supernatural force. Since "A New Beginning", no sequel has attempted to replace Jason as the main antagonist. Miller, who has not seen any of the sequels, took issue with all of them because they made Jason the villain. Miller believes the best part of his screenplay was that it was about a mother avenging the senseless death of her son. Miller stated, "Jason was dead from the very beginning; he was a victim, not a villain."

Jason Voorhees went from deceased child to full-grown man for "Friday the 13th Part 2", and Warrington Gillette was hired to play the role. Gillette auditioned for the role of Paul; that role eventually went to John Furey. Under the belief that he had attended the Hollywood Stuntman's School, Gillette was offered the role of Jason Voorhees.<ref name="Cast/Design">Bracke, pp. 60–65</ref> Initially Gillette was unsure about the character, but the idea of starring in his first film grew on Gillette, and he also thought the role was amusing. It became apparent Gillette could not perform the necessary stunts, so the stunt coordinator Cliff Cudney brought in Steve Daskawisz. Daskawisz filmed all of the scenes except the opening sequence and the unmasking shot at the end; Gillette returned for the unmasking scenes. Gillette received credit for playing Jason, while Daskawisz was given credit as the stunt double. When "Part 3" was released the following year, Daskawisz was credited as Jason for the reused footage from the climax of the film. Initially, Daskawisz was asked to return to the role for "Part 3", but it would have required him to pay for his own transportation and housing during filming. Having secured a part on "<a href="Guiding%20Light">Guiding Light</a>", Daskawisz declined.

Now wanting a "bigger and stronger-looking" Jason, one that was also "more athletic and powerful", <a href="Steve%20Miner">Steve Miner</a> hired former <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="trapeze">trapeze</a> artist <a href="Richard%20Brooker">Richard Brooker</a>. After a simple conversation, Miner decided he was the right person for the job. Being new to the country, Brooker believed that "playing a psychopathic killer" was the best way into the movie business. Brooker became the first actor to wear Jason's now-signature hockey mask. According to Brooker, "It felt great with the mask on. It just felt like I really was Jason because I didn't have anything to wear before that." For "The Final Chapter", Joseph Zito brought his own spin to the character, one that required a "real hardcore stuntman"; Ted White was hired to perform the role. White, who only took the job for the money, did "get into the Jason psychology" when he arrived on the set. White went so far as to not speak to any of the other actors for long stretches. As filming continued, White's experience was not pleasant, and in one instance, he went to battle for co-star <a href="Judie%20Aronson">Judie Aronson</a>, who played Samantha, when the director kept her naked in the lake for extended periods of time. Displeased with his experience from filming, White had his name removed from the credits. As with "Friday the 13th Part 2", there was confusion over who performed the role in "A New Beginning", partly because Jason is not the literal antagonist in the film. When Ted White turned down the opportunity to return, Dick Wieand was cast. Wieand is credited as Roy Burns, the film's actual murderer, but it was stuntman Tom Morga who performed in the few flashes of Jason, as well as portraying Roy in almost all of the masked scenes. Wieand has been outspoken about his lack of enthusiasm over his role in the film. Feeling alienated during the shoot, Wieand spent most of his time in his trailer. By comparison, Morga enjoyed his time as Jason and made sure he "really got into the character".
A <a href="nightclub">nightclub</a> manager in Glendale, <a href="C.%20J.%20Graham">C. J. Graham</a>, was interviewed for the role of Jason in "Jason Lives", but was initially passed over because he had no experience as a stuntman. <a href="Dan%20Bradley">Dan Bradley</a> was hired, but Paramount executives felt Bradley did not have the right physique to play the role, and Graham was hired to replace him.<ref name="Brad/Grah">Grove, pp. 144, 148</ref> Although Bradley was replaced early during filming, he can be seen in the paintball sequence of the film. Graham opted to perform most of his own stunts, including the scene where Jason catches on fire while battling Tommy in the lake. The rest of the cast spoke highly of Graham, remarking that he never complained during all the uncomfortable situations he was placed in. Graham had no intention of being an actor or a stuntman, but the idea of playing the "bad guy", and the opportunity to wear the prosthetics, intrigued him. Graham was not brought back to reprise the role, but has often been cited as speaking highly of his time in the part.

Kane Hodder took over the role in "The New Blood", and played Jason in the next four films. He previously worked alongside director <a href="John%20Carl%20Buechler">John Carl Buechler</a> on a film called "<a href="Prison%20%281988%20film%29">Prison</a>". Based on his experience working with Hodder, Buechler petitioned Frank Mancuso Jr. to hire him, but Mancuso was apprehensive about Hodder's limited size. Knowing he planned to use full body prosthetics, Buechler scheduled a test screening, the first in "Friday the 13th" history for the character, and Mancuso immediately gave Hodder approval upon seeing him. It is Buechler's contention that Hodder gave Jason his first true personality, based on the emotions, specifically the rage, that Hodder would emit while acting the part. According to Hodder, he wanted to "get in touch with Jason's thirst for revenge" and try to better understand his motivation to kill. After viewing the previous films, Hodder decided that he would approach Jason as a more "quick and agile" individual than he had been portrayed in the previous sequels. John Carl Buechler felt that Kane had "natural affinity for the role"—so much that Kane's appearance, when wearing the mask, would often terrify the cast, the crew, and in one incident a lone stranger that he came across on his walk back to his trailer. Initially Frank Mancuso Jr. and Barbara Sachs planned to use a Canadian stuntperson for "Jason Takes Manhattan". Hodder acted as his own voice, calling and requesting that he be allowed to reprise the role; the ultimate decision was left to director Rob Hedden, who intended to use Hodder, because he felt Hodder knew the lore of the series. With Sean Cunningham's return as producer for "Jason Goes to Hell", Hodder felt his chances of reprising the role were even better: Hodder had worked as Cunningham's stunt coordinator for years. Regardless, Adam Marcus, the director for "Jason Goes to Hell", always intended to hire Hodder for the role. "Jason X" would mark Hodder's last performance as Jason, to date. Todd Farmer, who wrote the screenplay for "Jason X", knew Hodder would play Jason from the beginning. Jim Isaac was a fan of Hodder's work on the previous films, so hiring him was an easy decision.

<a href="New%20Line%20Cinema">New Line</a> believed "Freddy vs. Jason" needed a fresh start, and choose a new actor for Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing Hodder was the best choice for the role. Hodder did receive the script for "Freddy vs. Jason", and had a meeting with director <a href="Ronny%20Yu">Ronny Yu</a> and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason. According to Hodder, New Line failed to provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films. Yu and development executive <a href="Jeff%20Katz">Jeff Katz</a> recognized the outcry among fans over the replacement of Hodder as Jason, but stood by their choice in recasting.

The role eventually went to <a href="Ken%20Kirzinger">Ken Kirzinger</a>, a Canadian stuntman who worked on "Jason Takes Manhattan". There are conflicting reports over the reason Kirzinger was cast. According to Yu, Kirzinger was hired because he was taller than Robert Englund, the actor who portrays Freddy Krueger. Kirzinger stands , compared to the of Kane Hodder, and Yu wanted a much larger actor to tower over the Englund. Kirzinger believes his experience on "Part VIII" helped him land the part, as Kirzinger doubled for Hodder on two scenes for the film, but also believes he was simply sized up and handed the job. Although he was hired by the creative crew, New Line did not officially cast Kirzinger until first seeing him on film. Kirzinger's first scene was Jason walking down Elm Street. New Line wanted a specific movement in Jason's walk; Kirzinger met their expectations and signed a contract with the studio. However, concerns that test audiences were confused by the film's original ending caused the studio to reshoot the final scene. Actor <a href="Douglas%20Tait%20%28stuntman%29">Douglas Tait</a> was brought in to film the new ending, as he was available for the reshoot and had been the production's second choice to portray the role of Jason during the original casting.

For the 2009 remake, stuntman <a href="Derek%20Mears">Derek Mears</a> was hired to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried about his ability to portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them he would be able to perform the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor over just another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to <a href="Theatre%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Greek mask work</a>, where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance.

The physical design of Jason Voorhees has gone through changes, some subtle and some radical. For "Friday the 13th", the task of coming up with Jason's appearance was the responsibility of <a href="Tom%20Savini">Tom Savini</a>, whose design for Jason was inspired by someone Savini knew as a child whose eyes and ears did not line up straight. The original design called for Jason to have hair, but Savini and his crew opted to make him bald, so he would look like a "<a href="Hydrocephalus">hydrocephalic</a>, mongoloid pinhead", with a dome-shaped head. Savini created a plaster mold of Ari Lehman's head and used that to create prosthetics for his face. Lehman personally placed mud—from the bottom of the lake—all over his body to make himself appear "really slimy."

For "Part 2", Steve Miner asked Carl Fullerton, the make-up effects supervisor, to stick to Savini's original design, but Fullerton only had one day to design and sculpt a new head. Fullerton drew a rough sketch of what he believed Jason should look like, and had it approved by Miner. Fullerton added long hair to the character. Gillette had to spend hours in a chair as they applied rubber forms all over his face, and had to keep one eye closed while the "droopy eye" application was in place. Gillette's eye was closed for twelve hours at a time while he was filming the final scenes of the film. False teeth created by a local dentist were used to distort Gillette's face. Much of the basic concept of Fullerton's design was eliminated for "Part 3". Miner wanted to use a combination of the designs from Tom Savini and Carl Fullerton, but as work progressed the design began to lean more and more toward Savini's concept. <a href="Stan%20Winston">Stan Winston</a> was hired to create a design for Jason's head, but the eyes were level and Doug White, the make-up artist for "Part 3", needed a droopy right eye. White did keep Winston's design for the back of the head, because the crew did not have the time to design an entirely new head for Jason. The process of creating Jason's look was hard work for White, who had to constantly make alterations to Richard Brooker's face, even up to the last day of filming.
The script for "Part 3" called for Jason to wear a mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in "Part 2"; what no one knew at the time was that the mask chosen would become a trademark for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask would slip on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.

Tom Savini agreed to return to make-up duties for "The Final Chapter" because he felt he should be the one to bring Jason full circle in terms of his look from child to man. Savini used his design from the original "Friday the 13th", with the same practice of application as before, but molded from Ted White's face. Since Jason is not the actual killer in "A New Beginning", it was not necessary to do any major designing for Jason's look. Only a head mask to cover the top and back of the head, like the one Brooker wore while wearing the hockey mask, was needed for the film. Make-up artist Louis Lazzara, who cites "A New Beginning" as almost a direct sequel to "The Final Chapter", did base his head-mask on Tom Savini's design for "The Final Chapter".

"Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood" sought to make Jason more of a "classic monster along the lines of Frankenstein." From the beginning, Buechler tried to tie the previous films together by having Jason's appearance reflect that of the damage he received in the previous installments. Buechler wanted the motor boat damage from "Jason Lives", and the axe and machete cuts Jason received in "Part 3" and "Part 4" to part of the design for "The New Blood". Since Jason had been submerged under water in the previous entry, the effects team wanted Jason to appear "rotted", with bones and ribs showing, and for Jason's features to have a more defined feel to them. <a href="Howard%20Berger">Howard Berger</a> was inspired by Carl Fullerton's design in "The New Blood", and wanted to incorporate the exposed flesh concept into his model for "Jason Goes to Hell". Berger designed Jason's skin to overlap with the mask, to make it appear as if the skin and mask had fused and the mask could no longer be removed. <a href="Gregory%20Nicotero">Gregory Nicotero</a> and Berger sculpted a full-body, foam latex suit for Kane Hodder to wear under the costume. The idea was to reveal as much of Jason's skin as possible, because Nicotero and Berger knew the physical character would not be seen for most of the film.
Stephan Dupuis was given the task of redesigning Jason for the tenth "Friday the 13th" film. One concept brought into the film was Jason's regenerative abilities. Dupuis gave the character more hair and more of a natural flesh appearance to illustrate the constant regeneration the character goes through; Dupuis wanted a more "<a href="Gothic%20aesthetics">gothic</a>" design for Jason, so he added chains and shackles, and made the hockey mask more angular. Jim Isaac and the rest of his crew wanted to create an entirely new Jason at some point in the film. The idea was for the teens to completely destroy Jason's body, allowing the futuristic technology to bring him back to life. What was referred to as Über-Jason was designed to have chunks of metal growing from his body, bonded by tendrils that grew into the metal, all pushing through a leather suit. The metal was created from VacuForm, the same material used to increase the size of the original hockey mask, and was attached by Velcro. The tendrils were made from silicone. All of the pieces were crafted onto one suit, including an entire head piece, which Hodder wore. The make-up effects team added zippers along the side of the suit, which allowed Hodder to enter and exit the suit within 15 minutes.

By the time "Freddy vs. Jason" entered production there had been ten previous "Friday the 13th" films. Make-up effects artist Terezakis wanted to put his own mark on Jason's look—he wanted Jason to be less rotted and decomposed and more defined, so that the audience would see a new Jason, but still recognized the face. Terezakis tried to keep continuity with the previous films, but recognized that had he followed them too literally, then "Jason would have been reduced to a pile of goo." Ronny Yu wanted everything surrounding the hockey mask to act as a frame, making the mask the focal point of each shot. To achieve this, Terezakis created a "pooled-blood look" for the character by painting the skin black, based on the idea the blood had pooled in the back of his head because he had been lying on his back for a long time. As with other make-up artists before him, Terezakis followed Savini's original skull design, and aged it appropriately.

For the 2009 version of "Friday the 13th", effects artist Scott Stoddard took inspiration from Carl Fullerton's design in "Friday the 13th Part 2" and Tom Savini's work in "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter". Stoddard wanted to make sure that Jason appeared human and not like a monster. Stoddard's vision of Jason includes hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face, but he attempted to craft Jason's look in a way that would allow for a more human side to be seen. Stoddard took inspiration from the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. The make-up artist managed to acquire an original set piece, which he studied and later sculpted. Although he had a model of one of the original masks, Stoddard did not want to replicate it in its entirety. As Stoddard explains, "Because I didn't want to take something that already existed, there were things I thought were great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit, break them up." In the end, Stoddard crafted six versions of the mask, each with varying degrees of wear.

In his original appearance, Jason was scripted as a <a href="Developmental%20disability">mentally disabled</a> young boy. Since "Friday the 13th", Jason Voorhees has been depicted as a non-verbal, indestructible, <a href="machete">machete</a>-wielding mass murderer. Jason is primarily portrayed as being completely silent throughout the film series. Exceptions to this include flashbacks of Jason as a child, and a brief scene in "Jason Takes Manhattan" where the character cries out "Mommy, please don't let me drown!" in a child's voice before being submerged in toxic waste, and in "Jason Goes To Hell" where his spirit possesses other individuals. Online magazine <a href="Salon.com">Salon</a>'s Andrew O'Hehir describes Jason as a "silent, expressionless...blank slate." When discussing Jason psychologically, Sean S. Cunningham said, "...he doesn't have any personality. He's like a <a href="great%20white%20shark">great white shark</a>. You can't really defeat him. All you can hope for is to survive." Since "Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives", Jason has been a "virtually indestructible" being. Tom McLoughlin, the film's director, felt it was silly that Jason had previously been just another guy in a mask, who would kill people left and right, but get "beaten up and knocked down by the heroine at the end". McLoughlin wanted Jason to be more of a "formidable, unstoppable monster". In resurrecting Jason from the dead, McLoughlin also gave him the weakness of being rendered helpless if trapped beneath the waters of Crystal Lake; inspired by vampire lore, McLoughlin decided that Jason had in fact drowned as a child, and that returning him to his original resting place would immobilize him. This weakness would be presented again in "The New Blood," and the idea that Jason had drowned as a child was taken up by director Rob Hedden as a plot element in "Jason Takes Manhattan."

Many have given suggestions as Jason's motivation for killing. Ken Kirzinger refers to Jason as a "psychotic mama's boy gone horribly awry...very resilient. You can't kill him, but he feels pain, just not like everyone else." Kirzinger goes on to say that Jason is a "psycho-savant", and believes his actions are based on pleasing his mother, and not anything personal. Andrew O'Hehir has stated, "Coursing hormones act, of course, as smelling salts to prudish Jason, that ever-vigilant enforcer of <a href="William%20Bennett">William Bennett</a>-style values." Todd Farmer, writer for "Jason X", wrote the scene where Jason wakes from cryonic hibernation just as two of the teenagers are having sex. Farmer liked the idea that sex acts triggered Jason back to life. Whatever his motivations, Kane Hodder believes there is a limit to what he will do. According to Hodder, Jason might violently murder any person he comes across, but when "Jason Takes Manhattan" called for Hodder to kick the lead character's dog, Hodder refused, stating that, while Jason has no qualms against killing humans, he is not bad enough to <a href="Animal%20abuse">hurt</a> animals. Another example from "Jason Takes Manhattan", involves Jason being confronted by a street gang of young teenage boys one of whom threatens him with a knife, however Jason chooses not to kill them and instead scares them off by lifting up his mask and showing them his face. Likewise, director Tom McLoughlin chose not to have Jason harm any of the children he encounters in "Jason Lives," stating that Jason would not kill a child, out of a sympathy for the plight of children generated by his own death as a child.

In "Jason Goes to Hell", director Adam Marcus decided to include a copy of the <a href="Necronomicon%20Ex-Mortis">Necronomicon Ex-Mortis</a>, from the "<a href="Evil%20Dead">Evil Dead</a>" franchise, in the Voorhees home as a way to insinuate that Jason was actually a "Deadite", a type of demonic being from that series. Marcus stated the book's placement was intended to imply that Pamela Voorhees had used it to resurrect Jason after his childhood drowning, resulting in his supernatural abilities: "This is why Jason isn't Jason. He's Jason plus "The Evil Dead"... That, to me, is way more interesting as a mashup, and [Sam] <a href="Sam%20Raimi">Raimi</a> loved it! It's not like I could tell New Line my plan to include "The Evil Dead", because they don't own "The Evil Dead". So it had to be an <a href="Easter%20egg%20%28media%29">Easter egg</a>, and I did focus on it. It absolutely is <a href="canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a>." In an early draft of "Freddy vs. Jason", it was decided that one of the villains needed a redeemable factor. <a href="Ronald%20D.%20Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a>, co-writer of the first draft, explained that Jason was the easiest to make redeemable, because no one had previously ventured into the psychology surrounding the character. Moore saw the character as a "blank slate", and felt he was a character the audience could really root for. Another draft, penned by Mark Protosevich, followed Moore's idea of Jason having a redeemable quality. In the draft, Jason protects a pregnant teenager named Rachel Daniels. Protosevich explained, "It gets into this whole idea of there being two kinds of monsters. Freddy is a figure of actual pure evil and Jason is more like a figure of vengeance who punishes people he feels do not deserve to live. Ultimately, the two of them clash and Jason becomes an honorable monster." Writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, who wrote the final draft of the film, disagreed about making Jason a hero, although they drew comparisons between the fact that Freddy was a victimizer and Jason was a victim. They stated, "We did not want to make Jason any less scary. He's still a brutal killer ... We never wanted to put them in a situation where Jason is a hero ... They're both villains to be equally feared." Brenna O'Brien, co-founder of Fridaythe13thfilms.com, saw the character as having sympathetic qualities. She stated, "[Jason] was a deformed child who almost drowned and then spent the rest of his childhood growing up alone in the woods. He saw his mother get murdered by a camp counselor in the first "Friday the 13th", and so now he exacts his revenge on anyone who returns to Camp Crystal Lake. Teenage fans can identify with that sense of rejection and isolation, which you can't really get from other killers like <a href="Freddy%20Krueger">Freddy Krueger</a> and <a href="Michael%20Myers%20%28Halloween%29">Michael Myers</a>."

As Jason went through some characterization changes in the 2009 film, Derek Mears likens him more to a combination of <a href="John%20Rambo">John Rambo</a>, <a href="Tarzan">Tarzan</a>, and the Abominable Snowman from "<a href="Looney%20Tunes">Looney Tunes</a>". To him, this Jason is similar to Rambo because he sets up the other characters to fall into his traps. Like Rambo, he is more calculated because he feels that he has been wronged and he is fighting back; he is meant to be more sympathetic in this film. Fuller and Form contend that they did not want to make Jason too sympathetic to the audience. As Brad Fuller explains, "We do not want him to be sympathetic. Jason is not a comedic character, he is not sympathetic. He's a killing machine. Plain and simple."

In 2005, <a href="California%20State%20University">California State University</a>'s Media Psychology Lab surveyed 1,166 people Americans aged from 16 to 91 on the psychological appeal of movie monsters. Many of the characteristics associated with Jason Voorhees were appealing to the participants. In the survey, Jason was considered to be an "unstoppable killing machine." Participants were impressed by the "cornucopic feats of slicing and dicing a seemingly endless number of adolescents and the occasional adult." Out of the ten monsters used in the survey—which included <a href="vampire">vampire</a>s, Freddy Krueger, <a href="Frankenstein%27s%20monster">Frankenstein's monster</a>, Michael Myers, <a href="Godzilla">Godzilla</a>, <a href="Chucky%20%28Child%27s%20Play%29">Chucky</a>, <a href="Hannibal%20Lecter">Hannibal Lecter</a>, <a href="King%20Kong">King Kong</a> and <a href="Alien%20%28creature%20in%20Alien%20franchise%29">the Alien</a>—Jason scored the highest in all the categories involving killing variables. Further characteristics that appealed to the participants included Jason's "immortality, his apparent enjoyment of killing [and] his superhuman strength."

Jason Voorhees is one of the leading <a href="cultural%20icon">cultural icon</a>s of American <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>. In 1992 Jason was awarded the <a href="MTV">MTV</a> <a href="Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award">Lifetime Achievement Award</a>. He was the first of only three completely fictional characters to be presented the award; <a href="Godzilla">Godzilla</a> (1996) and <a href="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a> (1997) are the others. Jason was named No. 26 in "<a href="Wizard%20%28magazine%29">Wizard</a>" magazine's "100 greatest villains of all time". <a href="Universal%20Studios%20Theme%20Parks">Universal Studios theme parks</a>, in collaboration with New Line Cinema, used the character for their <a href="Halloween%20Horror%20Nights">Halloween Horror Nights</a> event.

The character has been produced and marketed as merchandise over the years. In 1988 Screamin' Toys produced a model kit where owners could build their own Jason statuette. The kit required the owner to cut and paint various parts in order to assemble the figure. Six years later, Screamin' Toys issued a new model kit for "Jason Goes to Hell". Both kits are now out of production. <a href="McFarlane%20Toys">McFarlane Toys</a> released two toy lines, one in 1998 and the other in 2002. The first was a figure of Jason from "Jason Goes to Hell", and the other was of Über-Jason from "Jason X". Since McFarlane's last toy line in 2002, there has been a steady production of action figures, dolls, and statuettes. These include tie-ins with the film "Freddy vs. Jason" (2003). In April 2010 Sideshow Toys released a polystone statue of Jason, based on the version appearing in the 2009 remake. <a href="National%20Entertainment%20Collectibles%20Association">NECA</a> and <a href="Mezco%20Toyz">Mezco Toyz</a> also released figures of Jason in its own action figure series.

Jason has made an appearance in five video games. He first appeared in "<a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20%281985%20computer%20game%29">Friday the 13th</a>", a 1985 <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> game. His next appearance was in 1989, when <a href="LJN">LJN</a>, an American game company known for its games based on popular movies in the 1980s and early 1990s, released <a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20%28NES%20game%29">"Friday the 13th"</a> on the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. The premise involved the gamer, who picks one of six camp counselors as their player, trying to save the campers from Jason, while battling various enemies throughout the game. On October 13, 2006, a "Friday the 13th" game was released for <a href="mobile%20phone">mobile phone</a>s. The game puts the user in the persona of Jason as he battles the undead. Jason also appears as a playable character in the fighting game "<a href="Mortal%20Kombat%20X">Mortal Kombat X</a>" as a downloadable content bonus character. A new "" was released in 2017, which allows players to take control of Jason or camp counselors in a multiplayer format focused on Jason trying to kill the counselors before they can escape or time runs out.

The character has been referenced, or made cameo appearances, in various entertainment mediums. Outside of literature sources based on the character, Jason has been featured in a variety of magazines and comic strips. "<a href="Cracked%20%28magazine%29">Cracked</a>" magazine has released several issues featuring parodies of Jason, and he has been featured on two of their covers. "<a href="Mad%20%28magazine%29">Mad</a>" magazine has featured the character in almost a dozen stories. He has appeared twice in the comic strip "<a href="Mother%20Goose%20and%20Grimm">Mother Goose and Grimm</a>". The "<a href="Usagi%20Yojimbo">Usagi Yojimbo</a>" antagonist Jei is based on Voorhees; his name, with the honorific "-san" attached, is in fact a pun on Voorhees' first name.
Many musical artists have made references to Jason Voorhees. Inspired by his own experience, Ari Lehman founded a band called FIRSTJASON. Lehman's band is classified as <a href="horror%20punk">horror punk</a>, and is influenced by the sounds of the <a href="Dead%20Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> and <a href="Misfits%20%28band%29">The Misfits</a>. The band's name pays homage to Lehman's portrayal of Jason Voorhees in the original "Friday the 13th". One of the band's songs is entitled "Jason is Watching". In 1986, coinciding with the release of "Jason Lives", <a href="Alice%20Cooper">Alice Cooper</a> released "<a href="He%27s%20Back%20%28The%20Man%20Behind%20the%20Mask%29">He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)</a>" from his album "<a href="Constrictor%20%28album%29">Constrictor</a>". The song was written to "signal Jason's big return" to the cinema, as he had been almost entirely absent in the previous film. <a href="Rapping">Rapper</a> <a href="Eminem">Eminem</a> has referenced Jason in several of his songs. The song "Criminal", from the album "<a href="The%20Marshall%20Mathers%20LP">The Marshall Mathers LP</a>", mentions Jason specifically, while songs "Amityville" and "Off the Wall"—the latter featured fellow rapper <a href="Redman%20%28rapper%29">Redman</a>—contain Harry Manfredini's music "ki, ki, ki ... ma, ma, ma" from the film series. Eminem sometimes wears a hockey mask during concerts. Other <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">rap artists</a> that have referenced Jason include <a href="Tupac%20Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a>, <a href="Dr.%20Dre">Dr. Dre</a>, <a href="LL%20Cool%20J">LL Cool J</a>, and <a href="Insane%20Clown%20Posse">Insane Clown Posse</a>. In 1989, <a href="Puerto%20Rican%20people">Puerto Rican</a> rapper <a href="Vico%20C">Vico C</a> had a song titled "Viernes 13" which featured Jason in <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. The song was so popular in the island that Vico C wrote a second part titled "Viernes 13, Parte II". <a href="VH1">VH1</a> issued an advertisement for their Vogue Fashion Awards which was labeled "Friday the 20th", and featured Jason's mask created out of <a href="rhinestone">rhinestone</a>.

Jason has been referenced or parodied in other films. In the film "<a href="Scream%20%281996%20film%29">Scream</a>", directed by "Elm Street" creator <a href="Wes%20Craven">Wes Craven</a>, actress <a href="Drew%20Barrymore">Drew Barrymore</a>'s character is being stalked by a killer who calls her on her home phone. In order to survive, she must answer the man's trivia questions. One question is "name the killer in "Friday the 13th"." She incorrectly guesses Jason, who did not become the killer for the film series until "Part 2". Writer <a href="Kevin%20Williamson%20%28screenwriter%29">Kevin Williamson</a> claimed his inspiration for this scene came when he asked this question in a bar while a group was playing a movie trivia quiz game. He received a free drink, because nobody got the answer right. In another Wes Craven film, "<a href="Cursed%20%282005%20film%29">Cursed</a>", a wax sculpture of Jason, from "Jason Goes to Hell", can be seen in a <a href="wax%20museum">wax museum</a>. In 2014, Jason made a cameo appearance in the <a href="RadioShack">RadioShack</a> <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVIII">Super Bowl XLVIII</a> commercial "<a href="The%20%2780s%20Called">The '80s Called</a>".

Jason has also been referenced by several television shows. The <a href="stop%20motion">stop motion</a> animated television series "<a href="Robot%20Chicken">Robot Chicken</a>" features Jason in three of its comedy sketches. In episode seventeen, "", the mystery-solving teenagers from "<a href="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a>" arrive at Camp Crystal Lake to investigate the Jason Voorhees murders, and are killed off one by one. <a href="Velma%20Dinkley">Velma</a> is the only survivor, and in typical Scooby-Doo fashion, she rips off Jason's mask to reveal his true identity: Old Man Phillips. In episode nineteen, "<a href="That%20Hurts%20Me">That Hurts Me</a>", Jason reappears, this time as a housemate of "Horror Movie <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28TV%20series%29">Big Brother</a>", alongside other famous slasher movie killers such as <a href="Michael%20Myers%20%28Halloween%29">Michael Myers</a>, <a href="Freddy%20Krueger">Freddy Krueger</a>, <a href="Leatherface">Leatherface</a>, <a href="Pinhead%20%28Hellraiser%29">Pinhead</a> and <a href="Ghostface%20%28Scream%29">Ghostface</a>. Three years later, in episode sixty-two, Jason is shown on the days before and after a typical "Friday the 13th". Jason is spoofed in the season five episode of "<a href="Family%20Guy">Family Guy</a>" entitled "<a href="It%20Takes%20a%20Village%20Idiot%2C%20and%20I%20Married%20One">It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One</a>". The so-called "Mr. Voorhees" explains to Asian reporter <a href="List%20of%20Family%20Guy%20characters%23Channel%205%20%28WQHG%29">Trisha Takanawa</a> how happy he is to see local wildlife return following the cleanup and rejuvenation of Lake Quahog. He reappears later in the episode as the manager of the "Britches and Hose" clothing store. As opposed to his monstrous personality in the films, Jason is depicted here as polite and articulate, albeit still a psychopath; he murders random swimmers and threatens to kill his employee if she screws up.

HMS Bellerophon (1786)

HMS "Bellerophon" was a <a href="Seventy-four%20%28ship%29">74-gun</a> <a href="third-rate">third-rate</a> <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Launched in 1786, she served during the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary</a> and <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, mostly on blockades or convoy escort duties. Known to sailors as the "Billy Ruffian", she fought in three fleet actions, the <a href="Glorious%20First%20of%20June">Glorious First of June</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile">Battle of the Nile</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>, and was the ship aboard which <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> finally surrendered, ending 22 years of nearly continuous war with France.

Built at <a href="Frindsbury">Frindsbury</a>, near <a href="Rochester%2C%20Kent">Rochester</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, "Bellerophon" was initially laid up <a href="Reserve%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">in ordinary</a>, briefly being commissioned during the <a href="Spanish%20Armament">Spanish</a> and <a href="Russian%20Armament">Russian Armament</a>s. She entered service with the Channel Fleet on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, and took part in the Glorious First of June in 1794, the first of several fleet actions of the wars. "Bellerophon" narrowly escaped being captured by the French in 1795, when her squadron was <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Groix">nearly overrun</a> by a powerful French fleet, but the bold actions of the squadron's commander, Vice-Admiral <a href="Sir%20William%20Cornwallis">Sir William Cornwallis</a>, caused the French to retreat. She played a minor role in efforts to intercept a <a href="Exp%C3%A9dition%20d%27Irlande">French invasion force bound for Ireland</a> in 1797, and then joined the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a> under <a href="John%20Jervis%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20St%20Vincent">Sir John Jervis</a>. Detached to reinforce Rear-Admiral <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Sir Horatio Nelson's</a> fleet in 1798, she took part in the decisive defeat of a French fleet at the Battle of the Nile. She then returned to England and went out to the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, where she spent the <a href="Peace%20of%20Amiens">Peace of Amiens</a> on cruises and convoy escort duty between the Caribbean and North America.

"Bellerophon" returned to European waters with the resumption of the wars with France, joining a fleet under Vice-Admiral <a href="Cuthbert%20Collingwood%2C%201st%20Baron%20Collingwood">Cuthbert Collingwood</a> blockading <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a>. The reinforced fleet, by then commanded by Horatio Nelson, engaged the combined Franco-Spanish fleet when it emerged from port. At the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October "Bellerophon" fought a bitter engagement against Spanish and French ships, sustaining heavy casualties including the death of her captain, <a href="John%20Cooke%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Cooke</a>. After repairs "Bellerophon" was employed blockading the enemy fleets in the <a href="English%20Channel">Channel</a> and the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. She plied the waters of the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> in 1809, making attacks on Russian shipping, and by 1810 was off the French coast again, blockading their ports. She went out to North America as a convoy escort between 1813 and 1814, and in 1815 was assigned to blockade the French Atlantic port of <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</a>. In July 1815, defeated at <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Waterloo</a> and finding escape to America barred by the blockading "Bellerophon", Napoleon came aboard "the ship that had dogged his steps for twenty years" (according to maritime historian <a href="David%20Cordingly">David Cordingly</a>) to finally surrender to the British. It was "Bellerophon"s last seagoing service. She was <a href="ship%20decommissioning">paid off</a> and converted to a <a href="prison%20ship">prison ship</a> in 1815, and was renamed "Captivity" in 1824 to free the name for <a href="HMS%20Waterloo%20%281818%29">another ship</a>. Moved to <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> in 1826, she continued in service until 1834, when the last convicts left. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1836, and she was broken up.

"Bellerophon"s long and distinguished career has been recorded in literature and <a href="Folk%20music%20of%20England">folk songs</a>, commemorating the achievements of the "Billy Ruffian".

"Bellerophon" was ordered from the commercial shipbuilder Edward Greaves and Company, of <a href="Frindsbury">Frindsbury</a> in Kent, on 11 January 1782 to a modified design originally developed by <a href="Surveyor%20of%20the%20Navy">Surveyor of the Navy</a> <a href="Thomas%20Slade">Sir Thomas Slade</a>. She was one of ten ships built to the modified <a href="Arrogant%20class%20ship%20of%20the%20line">"Arrogant"-class</a> design, originally developed by Slade in 1758 and used to build two ships, and . The design was resurrected and slightly altered in 1774, and approved by the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> on 25 August that year. The <a href="keel%20laying">keel was laid down</a> at Frindsbury in May 1782. Measuring on the <a href="gundeck">gundeck</a> and on the <a href="keel">keel</a>, she had a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , measured 1,612 <a href="Builder%27s%20Old%20Measurement">tons burthen</a> and mounted 74 guns. This armament consisted of twenty-eight 32-pounder guns on her lower gundeck, twenty-eight 18-pounder guns on the upper gundeck, fourteen 9-pounder guns on the <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a> and four 9-pounder guns on the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a>.

The ship was named "Bellerophon", a decision that had been arrived at by at least April 1782, when it was entered into the <a href="minutes">minutes</a> of the Surveyor's Office. The <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> at the time, <a href="John%20Montagu%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Sandwich">John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich</a>, had apparently selected the name from <a href="John%20Lempri%C3%A8re">Lemprière</a>'s <a href="Lempri%C3%A8re%27s%20Bibliotheca%20Classica">Classical Dictionary</a>, which he kept on his desk. The recently ordered 74-gun ship was thereafter to be named after the Greek warrior <a href="Bellerophon">Bellerophon</a> who rode the winged horse <a href="Pegasus">Pegasus</a> and slew the monster <a href="Chimera%20%28mythology%29">Chimera</a>. The pronunciation proved difficult for the ordinary sailors of the period, and she was widely known by variants, most commonly "Billy Ruffian" or "Billy Ruff'n", although "Belly Ruff One" appears in a satirical 1810 print by <a href="Thomas%20Rowlandson">Thomas Rowlandson</a>, and "Bellyruffron" in the novel "<a href="Poor%20Jack">Poor Jack</a>" by <a href="Frederick%20Marryat">Frederick Marryat</a>. She was decorated with a <a href="figurehead%20%28object%29">figurehead</a> of Bellerophon.

By the time "Bellerophon" was launched, there was no pressing need for new warships. The signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a> in 1783 brought the <a href="American%20War%20of%20Independence">American War of Independence</a> to an end while "Bellerophon" was still under construction. Though Greaves had been contracted to have her ready for launching by April 1784, she spent another two years on the <a href="slipway">slipway</a>, probably because the Navy Board ordered construction work to be delayed to allow her timber to be <a href="Wood%20drying">seasoned</a>, a luxury available now that there were no pressing military needs. When the launch came, it was delayed several times, finally taking place during a period of heavy autumn storms in October 1786. She was launched with little ceremony on 7 October 1786, by Commissioner Charles Proby, of <a href="Chatham%20Dockyard">Chatham Dockyard</a>. She was then towed across the <a href="River%20Medway">River Medway</a> and anchored off Chatham Dockyard. She was taken into the <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a> there on 7 March 1787, where her hull was fitted with <a href="copper%20sheathing">copper sheathing</a>, and she was fitted for <a href="Reserve%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">the Ordinary</a>. Her final costs came to £30,232.14.4d paid to Greaves for building her, and a further £8,376.15.2d spent on fitting her for service.

Laid up at Chatham during the years of peace, "Bellerophon" was not commissioned until July 1790, when the crisis known as the <a href="Spanish%20Armament">Spanish Armament</a> broke out. As war with Spain threatened, warships lying in ordinary began to be commissioned and fitted for sea. "Bellerophon"s first commander, Captain <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Pasley%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Pasley</a>, arrived on 19 July and began the process of preparing her for service. After a month spent fitting out the ship with guns, masts, stores and rigging, and recruiting a crew, Pasley gave the orders for his crew to slip the moorings on 16 August, and "Bellerophon" made her way down the Medway to the fleet anchorage at the <a href="Nore">Nore</a>.
From the Nore, "Bellerophon" proceeded to <a href="The%20Downs%20%28ship%20anchorage%29">the Downs</a> and joined the fleet stationed there. She spent three weeks in the <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a>, exercising her guns, before moving to <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a>. The diplomatic crisis with Spain had largely abated by October 1790, and "Bellerophon" was sent to <a href="Sheerness">Sheerness</a> in late November. She remained in commission, still under Pasley, during the <a href="Russian%20Armament">Russian Armament</a> in 1791, but when this period of tension also passed without breaking into open war, "Bellerophon" was sent back to Chatham and paid off there on 9 September 1791.

With the outbreak of the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, "Bellerophon" was commissioned in March 1793, under her former captain, Thomas Pasley. Pasley fitted her for sea and sailed to join the <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> under Admiral <a href="Richard%20Howe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Howe">Lord Howe</a>. The Channel Fleet sailed on 14 July, with orders to patrol off <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> in the hope of intercepting and destroying the French fleet based there. While south-west of the <a href="Scilly%20Isles">Scilly Isles</a> on 18 July, "Bellerophon" collided with in gale-force winds. "Bellerophon" lost her <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a>, <a href="foremast">foremast</a> and <a href="main%20topmast">main topmast</a>, and had her figurehead and <a href="cutwater">cutwater</a> smashed, which necessitated putting into <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> for repairs.

After being repaired, "Bellerophon" rejoined the Channel Fleet, which by now was patrolling the <a href="Western%20Approaches">Western Approaches</a>. She developed a reputation for speed during these duties, and was given the nickname of "The Flying Bellerophon". In September 1793 Howe assigned her to a flying squadron made up of the fastest ships of the line, and gave Pasley command of the squadron, with the temporary rank of <a href="commodore%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">commodore</a>.

On 27 November 1793, the ships of Pasley's squadron captured the French corvette <a href="French%20corvette%20Blonde%20%281781%29">"Blonde"</a>. At the time of her capture "Blonde" was armed with 28 guns and had a crew of 210 men under the command of Citizen Gueria. A subsequent prize money notice listed the vessels that shared in the proceeds as "Bellerophon", , , , and .

With Pasley now responsible for a squadron, "Bellerophon" received a new commander in January 1794, Captain <a href="William%20Johnstone%20Hope">William Johnstone Hope</a>, with Commodore Pasley continuing to fly his <a href="broad%20pennant">broad pennant</a> aboard her. For the next five months the Channel Fleet patrolled off <a href="Ushant">Ushant</a> and the <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> coast.

The Channel Fleet played an important role in the closing stages of the <a href="Atlantic%20campaign%20of%20May%201794">Atlantic campaign of May 1794</a>, when Howe moved out into the Atlantic in the hope of intercepting an approaching French convoy under Admiral <a href="Pierre%20Jean%20Van%20Stabel">Pierre Jean Van Stabel</a>. The main French battlefleet was also known to be at sea, under Admiral <a href="Louis%20Thomas%20Villaret%20de%20Joyeuse">Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse</a>. Howe sent Pasley, recently promoted to <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">rear-admiral</a>, and his flying squadron, consisting of "Bellerophon" and the 74-gun ships , and , ahead to scout for French forces. At 6 am on 28 May the attached frigate signalled "Bellerophon" to report a sighting of a strange fleet. Pasley took the squadron south-east to investigate, coming in sight of a large fleet at 9 am, and counting thirty-three ships, of which at least twenty-three appeared to be ships of the line. They were confirmed as French by noon, and Pasley signalled this news back to Howe. Howe ordered a pursuit, and by evening the leading British ships, with Pasley's flying squadron forming the van, came in contact with the rear-most French. "Bellerophon" was the first ship to come into action, when the 110-gun <a href="French%20ship%20Bretagne%20%281766%29">"Révolutionnaire"</a> dropped back to block her approach. Pasley <a href="Tacking%20%28sailing%29">tacked</a> to close the French ship and began exchanging <a href="broadside">broadside</a>s. The heavy fire of the larger French ship caused considerable damage, particularly to "Bellerophon"s main topmast, and she fought alone until the remainder of the flying squadron and two ships from the main fleet, and , arrived to assist her. The damaged "Bellerophon" then drifted clear of the action, and as night fell Howe signalled for the fleet to reform in line ahead and wait for morning before resuming the engagement.

The action resumed the following morning, with Howe closing on the French and then cutting through their line. "Bellerophon" followed Howe's <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, the 100-gun , and sustained some damage from French fire. Howe isolated several French ships in the rear and pounded them with broadsides, but Villaret de Joyeuse was able to bring his van about to rescue them, and the two fleets parted again at night to reform their battle lines and repair damage. Poor weather on 30 May and 31 May prevented the fleets from making contact, but the following day, 1 June, Howe was able to bring about a decisive action, later known as the Glorious First of June. The British approached in line abreast, with "Bellerophon" at the end of the line. As they approached, the ships were heavily cannonaded by the French. Pasley was hit in the leg by a cannonball as he stood on the quarterdeck, with Midshipman <a href="Matthew%20Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a> reporting that "our brave admiral lost his leg by an 18-pounder shot which came in through the barricadoes of the quarter-deck – it was in the heat of the action." When two seamen expressed their sorrow, Pasley replied "Thank you, but never mind my leg: take care of my flag." He was taken below where the shattered leg was amputated. Captain Hope kept the ship in the engagement, pounding the 74-gun <a href="French%20ship%20%C3%89ole%20%281789%29">"Éole"</a> until the French ship was forced out of the line. "Bellerophon" had by then lost all three topmasts, and her <a href="mainsail">mainsail</a> and lower <a href="Shroud%20%28sailing%29">shrouds</a> had been cut to pieces. Hope then signalled the frigate to tow the "Bellerophon" clear of the action. Despite being under heavy fire during the battle, "Bellerophon"s casualties were comparatively light, amounting to four men killed and between twenty-seven and thirty wounded.

"Bellerophon" returned with the fleet to England after the battle, where the wounded Pasley left the ship. "Bellerophon" was taken into <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">Portsmouth Dockyard</a> for repairs, and then resumed her patrols in the Western Approaches with the Channel Fleet. Captain Hope was superseded in late November, and on 1 December 1794 "Bellerophon" received a new commander, Captain <a href="James%20Cranstoun%2C%208th%20Lord%20Cranstoun">James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun</a>.

"Bellerophon" returned to sea in May 1795 after three months anchored in the <a href="Solent">Solent</a>. She had been at Spithead on 1 May, when the 98-gun caught fire and blew up, with "Bellerophon" rescuing twelve men. Still with the Channel Fleet, she joined a squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral <a href="William%20Cornwallis">Sir William Cornwallis</a> which was patrolling off Ushant. The squadron had arrived on station on 7 June, and the following day captured a convoy of eight French merchants off <a href="Belle%20%C3%8Ele">Belle Île</a>. The squadron remained in the area until 16 June, when a lookout on "Bellerophon" spotted a large fleet to the east-south-east. This was the Brest fleet, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, two frigates, two <a href="brig">brig</a>s and a <a href="cutter%20%28boat%29">cutter</a>, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse. Heavily outnumbered, Cornwallis ordered a retreat, but the "Bellerophon" and sailed unusually slowly and he found himself being steadily overhauled by the French. Keeping his ships together, Cornwallis ordered "Bellerophon" to take up position at the head of his line, later explaining that "The Bellerophon I was glad to keep in some measure as a reserve, having reason at first to suppose there would be full occasion for the utmost exertions of us all ... I considered that ship a treasure in store, having heard of her former accomplishments, and observing the spirit manifested by all on board when she passed me, joined to the zeal and activity shewed by Lord Cranstoun during the whole cruize."

After a full day of pursuit, the leading French ships made an attempt to cut off , trailing in the British rear. Cornwallis dropped back to support "Mars", while Captain <a href="Robert%20Stopford%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Robert Stopford</a> of HMS "Phaeton" began making signals implying a British fleet was in sight. When French lookouts spotted distant topsails, Villaret de Joyeuse decided that Cornwallis's actions meant that a British fleet was approaching to support him, and called off the pursuit. There was no British fleet in the vicinity; the topsails were those of a convoy of British merchantmen.

"Bellerophon" returned to England in June, before departing to patrol the Western Approaches until September. She entered Portsmouth Dockyard again in October and underwent a refit costing £8,103. She resumed patrol and blockade duty in the Western Approaches in January 1796, at first under Cranstoun, but from April effectively under the acting-captaincy of Lieutenant <a href="John%20Loring%20%28d.%201808%29">John Loring</a>. Cranstoun's replacement, Captain <a href="Henry%20D%27Esterre%20Darby">Henry D'Esterre Darby</a>, arrived to take command in September. Blockade duty continued until early January 1797, when news reached the fleet that <a href="Exp%C3%A9dition%20d%27Irlande">a French expedition had appeared off Ireland</a>. Caught off guard, the Admiralty ordered "Bellerophon" and a number of other ships to patrol off <a href="Bantry%20Bay">Bantry Bay</a>. By then the French expedition had been dispersed by bad weather, and after three weeks on patrol, "Bellerophon" put into <a href="Cobh">Cork</a> where she rendezvoused with the Irish squadron under Admiral <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Kingsmill%2C%201st%20Baronet">Robert Kingsmill</a>. Shortly after her return to Spithead in early March, "Bellerophon" was given new orders by the Admiralty. She sailed on 17 March, bound for <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a> to join <a href="John%20Jervis%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20St%20Vincent">Sir John Jervis's</a> <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a> blockading the port.

"Bellerophon" rendezvoused with Jervis's fleet in the <a href="Bay%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">Bay of Cadiz</a> on 30 May 1797. Three days later she was visited for the only time by <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>, then a rear-admiral and in command of the inshore squadron of the blockading fleet. "Bellerophon" was with the fleet in the Bay of Cadiz until October, when Jervis took it to sea to patrol between <a href="Cape%20Trafalgar">Cape Trafalgar</a> and <a href="Cape%20St.%20Vincent">Cape St. Vincent</a>. These duties lasted until late May 1798, when "Bellerophon" was assigned to a detached squadron under Captain <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Troubridge%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Troubridge</a> and ordered to rendezvous with and reinforce Nelson's squadron. Nelson was in the Mediterranean hunting for a large French fleet which had sailed from <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> carrying troops.

The French had embarked on <a href="Mediterranean%20campaign%20of%201798">a complex land and naval campaign</a> in the Mediterranean, with the ultimate aim of launching an <a href="French%20campaign%20in%20Egypt%20and%20Syria">invasion and occupation of Egypt</a>. The British were aware that the French had amassed a large army, led by General <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, but their destination was unknown. Rendezvousing with Troubridge's squadron on 7 June, Nelson now had a sufficient force to engage the French, and began to comb the Mediterranean. The search lasted nearly two months, with the British force tracking westwards, and then back east, sometimes missing the French force by days. The French force, after invading and capturing <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, arrived off <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> on 1 July and began landing troops. It was not until 25 July that news reached Nelson, by then at anchor off <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, that the French fleet had appeared off Egypt. He took his fleet to sea, and arrived off Alexandria on 1 August, but found the harbour empty. Heading east, he discovered the French fleet, consisting of thirteen ships of the line, four frigates and a number of gunboats, at anchor in <a href="Abu%20Qir%20Bay">Abu Qir Bay</a>.

It was late on 1 August when the British fleet appeared in the bay, and the French were at anchor in a strong defensive position. The French commander, Vice-Admiral <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Paul%20Brueys%20d%27Aigalliers">François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers</a>, did not expect a night attack, but Nelson ordered his ships to form up and attack the head of the French van, taking advantage of a favourable wind which allowed his ships to drift down the line, while preventing the French rear from reinforcing the van and centre. "Bellerophon" was the eighth ship in the British line, and as the battle began, Darby turned her towards the French centre, eventually coming to anchor at 7 pm. Possibly due to some error on the part of the crew or because the anchor had dragged, "Bellerophon" came to rest alongside the French flagship, the 120-gun <a href="French%20ship%20Orient%20%281791%29">"Orient"</a>.

"Bellerophon" now found herself in a desperate position. The much more powerful three-decked "Orient" fired several broadsides into the "Bellerophon", smashing her boats, dismounting guns and cutting rigging. French marines on the higher decks poured volleys of <a href="musket">musket fire</a> onto "Bellerophon"s exposed upper decks. Between 60 and 70 of her crew were killed or wounded in the first stages of the engagement, including Darby, who was rendered unconscious by a head wound. Command then devolved to the <a href="First%20lieutenant%23Royal%20Navy">first lieutenant</a>, Lieutenant Daniel. Daniel and the second lieutenant, Lieutenant Lander, were both wounded, but were able to direct the fighting until a shot took away Daniel's left leg. As he was carried below he was hit by grapeshot and killed outright. The fourth lieutenant, John Hadaway, was wounded and was taken below to the surgeon, while the fifth lieutenant, George Joliffe, was killed on the deck. After an hour fighting "Orient" alone, "Bellerophon"s <a href="mizzenmast">mizzenmast</a> collapsed, followed shortly afterwards by the mainmast. Lieutenant Lander was among those killed in the fall of the mainmast, and command devolved to the third lieutenant, the uninjured Lieutenant Robert Cathcart. Several fires had broken out on both "Bellerophon" and "Orient". According to the "Bellerophon"s logbook, at 9pm, when a further fire broke out on the "Orient", Cathcart was down below on duty, and the 13 year old Midshipman <a href="John%20Hindmarsh">John Hindmarsh</a> was briefly the senior officer on deck. He ordered the anchor cable cut and the <a href="spritsail">spritsail</a> was hoisted, but put too great a strain on the foremast, which collapsed. Now totally dismasted, "Bellerophon" began to drift away from the action, her crew fighting fires. As she moved out of the line she received some long range shots from the French <a href="HMS%20Tonnant%20%281798%29">"Tonnant"</a>.

As "Bellerophon" slowly drifted away, she was sighted by the 74-gun , approaching the centre. It was by now about 9 pm; in the darkness "Swiftsure"s captain, <a href="Benjamin%20Hallowell%20Carew">Benjamin Hallowell</a>, was unable to identify the dismasted ship and presumed that she was a damaged French ship attempting to escape. He debated firing into her, but decided to hold fire and press on to the French centre, where he eventually came to anchor astern of "Orient", close to "Bellerophon"s original position. Darby had by this time recovered sufficiently to resume command, and at his order the battered "Bellerophon" came to anchor at the east end of the bay, and her crew began making repairs. The battle raged throughout the night, and eventually ended in a decisive victory for the British. The next five days were spent repairing the ship and burying the dead. 49 men were killed and 148 wounded on "Bellerophon". Eight more died of their wounds in the following week.

After carrying out temporary repairs in Abu Qir Bay, "Bellerophon" hoisted <a href="jury%20mast">jury mast</a>s and, towing the captured <a href="HMS%20Spartiate%20%281798%29">"Spartiate"</a> with HMS "Majestic", sailed to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> for a refit. When this was completed she returned to Britain, arriving at Spithead on 2 April 1800, where she paid off and entered the dockyard for a more substantial refit in September. These works amounted to £32,608 and lasted until August 1801. She recommissioned on 25 June 1801 under the command of Captain <a href="George%20Stewart%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Galloway">Lord Garlies</a> and sailed in August to rejoin the Channel Fleet, which was blockading Brest. Lord Garlies was superseded by Captain John Loring on 25 November, and "Bellerophon" continued on the blockade until receiving new orders in early March 1802.

"Bellerophon" was among five ships ordered to join Admiral <a href="Sir%20John%20Duckworth%2C%201st%20Baronet">John Duckworth's</a> squadron in the West Indies, and having stored, she sailed from <a href="Torbay">Torbay</a> on 2 March 1802. By the time of her arrival on 27 March, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amiens">Treaty of Amiens</a> had been signed, and Britain and France were at peace. For the next eighteen months "Bellerophon" took part in cruises in the <a href="Jamaica%20Channel">Jamaica Passage</a> and escorted merchant convoys between Jamaica and <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a>.

"Bellerophon" was in the West Indies when the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> broke out in May 1803. Her captain, John Loring, was appointed commodore of the British squadron, which quickly went on the offensive against French shipping in the <a href="Blockade%20of%20Saint-Domingue">Blockade of Saint-Domingue</a>. In mid-1803, the squadron under Captain <a href="Henry%20William%20Bayntun">Henry William Bayntun</a>, consisting of HMS "Bellerophon", , , , and captured the French privateers <a href="HMS%20Flying%20Fish%20%281803%29">"Poisson Volant"</a> and . The Royal Navy took both into service. The <a href="corvette">corvette</a> <a href="French%20corvette%20Mignonne%20%281797%29">"Mignonne"</a> and a brig were captured in late June, after which the British patrolled off <a href="Cap-Ha%C3%AFtien">Cap-François</a>. On 24 July the squadron, made up of "Bellerophon" and the 74-gun ships HMS "Elephant", and HMS "Vanguard", came across two French 74-gun ships, <a href="French%20ship%20Duquesne%20%281787%29">"Duquesne"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Implacable%20%281805%29">"Duguay-Trouin"</a>, and the frigate <a href="HMS%20Guerriere%20%281806%29">"Guerrière"</a>, attempting to escape from Cap-François. The squadron gave chase, and on 25 July overhauled and captured "Duquesne" after a few shots were fired, while "Duguay-Trouin" and "Guerrière" managed to evade their pursuers and escape to France. One man was killed aboard "Bellerophon" during the pursuit. She remained blockading Cap-François until November, when the French commander of the garrison there, General <a href="Donatien-Marie-Joseph%20de%20Vimeur%2C%20vicomte%20de%20Rochambeau">Rochambeau</a>, approached Loring and requested to be allowed to evacuate his men, which were being besieged by a native Haitian force led by <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Dessalines">Jean-Jacques Dessalines</a>. To prevent Rochambeau escaping, Loring sent launches from "Bellerophon" and "Elephant" into the Caracol Passage where they cut out the French schooner <a href="French%20schooner%20D%C3%A9couverte%20%281800%29">"Découverte"</a> on 22–23 November. The French formally surrendered on 30 November and were allowed to evacuate on three frigates, <a href="French%20frigate%20Surveillante%20%281802%29">"Surveillante"</a>, <a href="French%20frigate%20Clorinde%20%281801%29">"Clorinde"</a>, and <a href="French%20frigate%20Vertu%20%281794%29">"Vertu"</a>, and a number of smaller ships, and were escorted to Jamaica by the squadron.

A particularly severe outbreak of <a href="malaria">malaria</a> struck the ship in early February 1804; 212 members of "Bellerophon"s crew fell ill. 17 died aboard the ship, while 100 had to be transferred to a shore-based hospital, where a further 40 died. She was ordered back to Britain in June, escorting a large convoy, and arrived in the Downs on 11 August. She briefly paid off and was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit. On 27 September four shipwrights working in magazine by candle light set off some loose powder. The explosion killed all four.

"Bellerophon" rejoined the Channel Fleet, still off Brest, and under the command of Admiral Sir William Cornwallis. These duties lasted until early 1805, with Loring being superseded by Captain <a href="John%20Cooke%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Cooke</a> on 24 April.

In May 1805 a large French fleet under the command of Vice-Admiral <a href="Pierre-Charles%20Villeneuve">Pierre-Charles Villeneuve</a> escaped from Toulon. "Bellerophon" was dispatched with a squadron under Vice-Admiral <a href="Cuthbert%20Collingwood%2C%201st%20Baron%20Collingwood">Cuthbert Collingwood</a> to patrol the <a href="Straits%20of%20Gibraltar">Straits of Gibraltar</a>. Before they could arrive, Villeneuve had collected Spanish reinforcements under Admiral <a href="Federico%20Carlos%20Gravina%20y%20N%C3%A1poli">Federico Gravina</a>, and had sailed into the Atlantic, pursued by Nelson's Mediterranean Fleet. While Nelson chased Villeneuve around the West Indies without making contact, Collingwood mounted a blockade of Cadiz. His squadron was still there in mid-August when Villeneuve appeared off the port with his fleet. Possessing too few ships to intercept the combined fleet, Collingwood allowed them to enter Cadiz, and then remounted the blockade. He was reinforced with a number of ships over the next few months, with Nelson taking over command on 28 September.

Nelson mounted a loose blockade of the combined fleet, keeping most of his fleet out of sight, but with a line of frigates and larger ships stationed at intervals between himself and Cadiz. On 19 October the combined fleet was observed to be putting to sea, and the signal was passed down the line of ships. <a href="William%20Pryce%20Cumby">William Pryce Cumby</a>, "Bellerophon"s first lieutenant, was first in the main fleet to spot the signal, flying from the last ship in the communication link, HMS "Mars". The British began to pursue the combined fleet as it made its way towards the Straits of Gibraltar, and came in sight of it on the morning of 21 October. The officer and sailors of "Bellerophon" prepared for battle, some of the gun crews chalking the words "Victory or Death" on their gun barrels. At 11 am "Bellerophon"s signal midshipman, <a href="John%20Franklin">John Franklin</a>, noted that Nelson had hoisted the signal "<a href="England%20expects%20that%20every%20man%20will%20do%20his%20duty">England expects that every man will do his duty</a>", and an hour and a half later "Bellerophon" entered the battle as the fifth ship in Collingwood's lee column. She was astern of the 80-gun HMS "Tonnant" and ahead of the 74-gun , with the 74-gun close by her <a href="port%20and%20starboard">port</a> side.

At 12:30 pm, "Bellerophon" cut through the enemy line, slipping under the stern of the Spanish 74-gun <a href="Spanish%20ship%20Monarca%20%281794%29">"Monarca"</a> and firing two broadsides into her. Moving past the Spanish ship, "Bellerophon" collided with the French 74-gun <a href="French%20ship%20Aigle%20%281800%29">"Aigle"</a>, hitting "Aigle"s port quarter with her starboard bow, and entangling the two ships' <a href="yard%20%28sailing%29">yards</a>. Locked together, they exchanged broadsides at close range, with soldiers aboard "Aigle" sweeping "Bellerophon"s decks with musket fire and <a href="grenade">grenade</a>s. Cumby noticed that the officers were being targeted, and that Cooke's distinctive <a href="epaulette">epaulette</a>s marked him out. Cumby urged him to take them off, only for Cooke to reply "It is too late now to take them off. I see my situation but I will die like a man." "Bellerophon" was now sustaining fire from "Aigle" and three other ships, the Spanish <a href="Spanish%20ship%20San%20Juan%20Nepomuceno">"San Juan Nepomuceno"</a> and <a href="Spanish%20ship%20Bahama%20%281784%29">"Bahama"</a>, and the French "Swiftsure". "Bellerophon"s main and mizzenmasts were shot away at 1 pm, and at 1:11 pm, Captain Cooke was hit and killed. An eyewitness recorded that He had discharged his pistols very frequently at the enemy, who as often attempted to board, and he had killed a French officer on his own quarterdeck. He was in the act of reloading his pistols ... when he received two musket-balls in the breast. He immediately fell, and upon the quartermaster going up and asking him if he should take him down below, his answer was "No, let me lie quietly one minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike."

With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. "Bellerophon"s decks had largely been cleared by French fire, and boarding parties began to make their way onto the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto "Bellerophon"s spritsail yard, but a "Bellerophon" crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto "Bellerophon"s rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. "Bellerophon"s <a href="ensign">ensign</a> had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a> he could find and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on "Aigle" reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the <a href="gunport">gunport</a>s, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into "Bellerophon" exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.

By 1:40 pm, having been under heavy fire for over an hour, "Aigle"s crew lowered her gunports and slowly moved away. When the smoke cleared, Cumby noticed that the Spanish "Monarca", which "Bellerophon" had first engaged, had <a href="striking%20the%20colours">struck her colours</a>. Cumby sent an officer in a boat to take possession of her. "Bellerophon"s crew now worked to make repairs and clear away wreckage. She briefly fired her guns again when the van of the combined fleet, led by Rear-Admiral <a href="Pierre%20Dumanoir%20le%20Pelley">Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley</a>, made a belated attempt to come to the assistance of the centre and rear. The attack was beaten off, and at 5 pm, "Bellerophon"s guns ceased firing. At 5:30 pm Cumby sent a boat to take possession of the "Bahama", which had also struck her colours. By the end of the battle "Bellerophon" had sustained casualties of 27 men killed and 123 wounded. Among the dead was her captain, the <a href="Master%20%28naval%29">master</a>, John Overton, and midshipman John Simmons.

For the next seven days, "Bellerophon"s crew were occupied in repairing damage, rigging jury masts, and trying to ride out the storm that struck the area immediately after the battle. She put into Gibraltar on 28 October 1805, and underwent emergency repairs to allow her to return to England as an escort for , together with . Both "Belleisle" and "Bellerophon" required urgent attention, but it was deemed appropriate that they should have the honour of accompanying Nelson's body back to Britain aboard "Victory". Cumby was superseded on 3 November, the day before beginning the voyage home, by Captain <a href="Richard%20Darton%20Thomas">Richard Thomas</a>. Thomas was himself superseded the next day however, by Captain <a href="Edward%20Rotheram">Edward Rotheram</a>, who had commanded Collingwood's flagship, , during the battle.

The three ships sailed together as far as <a href="Start%20Point%2C%20Cornwall">Start Point</a>, where on 2 December "Victory" separated to head to Portsmouth, while "Bellerophon" and "Belleisle" put into <a href="Cawsand%20Bay">Cawsand Bay</a>. "Bellerophon" was then taken into Plymouth Dockyard to be repaired, returning to active duty on 26 February, still under Rotheram's command. Joining the Channel Fleet once more, "Bellerophon" resumed her usual duties, blockading and patrolling off Ushant and Brest.

Rotheram's command lasted for two and half years, until he was superseded on 8 June 1808 by Captain <a href="Samuel%20Warren%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Samuel Warren</a>. Warren was ordered to take "Bellerophon" and join the fleet in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, blockading the Dutch ports. She formed part of Rear-Admiral <a href="Alan%20Gardner%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Gardner">Alan Gardner</a>'s squadron. By 1809 the strategic situation in the Baltic had deteriorated after <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a> signed the <a href="Treaties%20of%20Tilsit">Treaties of Tilsit</a> and began to support France. "Bellerophon" was ordered to join the fleet stationed in the Baltic under Admiral <a href="James%20Saumarez%2C%201st%20Baron%20de%20Saumarez">Sir James Saumarez</a>. Saumarez dispatched "Bellerophon" and north to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a> in June, and on 19 June the two ships came across three suspicious looking <a href="lugger">lugger</a>s, anchored off <a href="Hanko">Hango</a>. The water was too shallow to allow them to approach the luggers, so a boat party was dispatched under "Bellerophon"s Lieutenant Robert Pilch. The British boarded the luggers, but found themselves in a trap, when numerous Russian shore batteries and several gunboats opened fire on them. Pilch promptly ordered the luggers to be burnt, reboarded his men and landed them next to the nearest Russian shore battery. The battery, defended by 100 sailors, was stormed and carried, the British spiked the guns and destroyed the magazine, before returning to the ships with only five men wounded.

By July "Bellerophon" was part of a squadron commanded by Captain <a href="Thomas%20Byam%20Martin">Thomas Byam Martin</a> of HMS "Implacable". They were off Percola Point on 7 July when a flotilla of eight Russian gunboats was sighted. A boat party led by Lieutenant Hawkey of "Implacable" made an attempt to cut-out the vessels that evening. Hawkey was killed in the attempt, but "Bellerophon"s Lieutenant Charles Allen took over command, and six of the gunboats were captured, and a seventh destroyed, with 12 craft containing stores for the Russian Army also being taken. "Bellerophon" made several cruises during the rest of the year, visiting the <a href="%C3%85land%20Islands">Åland Islands</a> and <a href="Karlskrona">Karlskrona</a>, before returning to Britain with a convoy in November 1809.

"Bellerophon" was briefly refitted in January 1810, after which she was anchored at the Nore. She then resumed her blockade duties in the North Sea, serving under a succession of commanders. Warren was succeeded by Captain <a href="John%20Halsted">John Halsted</a> on 23 August, and he by Captain <a href="Augustus%20Brine">Augustus Brine</a> on 5 November. Brine's command lasted until February 1813, during which time "Bellerophon" remained with the North Sea blockading squadron. Captain <a href="Edward%20Hawker">Edward Hawker</a> arrived to take over command on 11 February 1813, and preparations were made for "Bellerophon" to become the flagship of Vice-Admiral <a href="Richard%20Goodwin%20Keats">Sir Richard Goodwin Keats</a>, the newly appointed <a href="List%20of%20lieutenant%20governors%20of%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador%23Commodore-Governors%20of%20Newfoundland%2C%201729-1825">Governor of Newfoundland</a>. "Bellerophon" transported Keats to <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's</a>, and then sailed south to <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> as a convoy escort. Returning to St John's in the summer, she captured several American ships, including the 16-gun <a href="privateer">privateer</a> "Genie". She spent the rest of the year patrolling off <a href="Cape%20Race">Cape Race</a>, before returning to Britain with a convoy in November. 1814 was spent on similar duties: "Bellerophon" escorted a convoy to St John's between April and June, and then patrolled off Cape Race until December. She then moved to the Nore, and on 9 April 1815 Hawker was superseded by Captain <a href="Frederick%20Lewis%20Maitland%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Frederick Lewis Maitland</a>.

In May "Bellerophon" sailed to Plymouth and joined a squadron under Rear-Admiral <a href="Henry%20Hotham">Sir Henry Hotham</a>, with orders to join the blockade of the French Atlantic ports. Hotham, flying his flag in , sent Maitland in "Bellerophon" to watch <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</a>, where two frigates, a brig and a corvette were lying in the harbour. "Bellerophon" spent over a month on this station, patrolling the approaches to the port and intercepting coastal vessels. Meanwhile, Napoleon had been defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> on 18 June and on 2 July he arrived in Rochefort. Following the defeat of his armies, and with the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">restoration of the Bourbon monarchy imminent</a>, Napoleon hoped to be allowed to sail to the United States. News reached Maitland in early July that Napoleon was in Rochefort, and two 20-gun ships, and , were sent to reinforce "Bellerophon" and patrol the other entrances to the port.

Napoleon was being pressured to leave French soil by the interim French government in Paris. If he delayed, he risked becoming a prisoner of the Bourbons, Prussians or Austrians. The alternative was to surrender to the British and request political asylum. On 10 July Napoleon sent two emissaries, General <a href="Anne%20Jean%20Marie%20Ren%C3%A9%20Savary">Anne Jean Marie René Savary</a> and the <a href="Emmanuel%2C%20comte%20de%20Las%20Cases">Comte de Las Cases</a>, out to "Bellerophon" to meet Maitland and discuss the possibility of allowing Napoleon to travel to the United States. Maitland was under orders to prevent this, and instead offered to take Napoleon on board his ship and transport him and his retinue to Britain. Further discussions and negotiations took place over the next few days, but with his options running out, Napoleon had decided by 13 July to surrender to the British. On 14 July Maitland was given a letter informing him that Napoleon would come out to "Bellerophon" the following morning to surrender.

Napoleon embarked aboard the brig "Épervier" early in the morning of 15 July, and made his way out to the "Bellerophon". As he approached, the 74-gun "Superb", flying Vice-Admiral Hotham's flag, was sighted approaching. Concerned that the brig might not reach "Bellerophon" before the "Superb" arrived, and that consequently Hotham would take over and receive Napoleon himself, Maitland sent "Bellerophon"s barge to collect the former Emperor and transfer him to the ship. At some point between 6 and 7 a.m., the barge pulled alongside "Bellerophon" and General <a href="Henri%20Gatien%20Bertrand">Henri Gatien Bertrand</a> climbed aboard, followed by Napoleon. The <a href="Royal%20Marines">marines</a> came to attention, and Napoleon walked to the quarterdeck, took his hat off to Maitland and in French announced "I am come to throw myself on the protection of your Prince and your laws." Maitland bowed in response. With the former emperor in custody aboard a British warship, the Napoleonic Wars were finally over. To maritime historian <a href="David%20Cordingly">David Cordingly</a>, this moment was "Bellerophon"s "crowning glory [when] six weeks after the battle of Waterloo, ... Napoleon, trapped in Rochefort, surrendered to the captain of the ship that had dogged his steps for more than twenty years."

Maitland showed Napoleon the <a href="Cabin%20%28ship%29">great cabin</a>, which he had placed at his disposal, and gave him a tour of his ship. At 10:30 a.m., "Superb" anchored in the roadstead and Maitland went to make his report. Hotham approved of his arrangements, and agreed that Napoleon should be transported to England aboard "Bellerophon". He came aboard himself to meet the former Emperor, and a grand dinner was held in the great cabin, attended by Napoleon's retinue and British officers. The following day Napoleon visited Hotham on "Superb", and after his return, Maitland began the voyage to England in company with HMS "Myrmidon". A routine was soon developed, with Napoleon usually taking a walk on deck around 5 p.m., followed by a formal dinner at 6 p.m. The sailors and officers removed their hats and kept their distance when Napoleon came on deck, only talking with him if he invited them to. The routine was broken slightly early in the morning of 23 July, when Napoleon appeared at dawn, as "Bellerophon" came in sight of <a href="Ushant">Ushant</a>, the last piece of French land visible for the remainder of the journey. He climbed up to the <a href="poop%20deck">poop deck</a>, attended by a midshipman, and spent the morning watching the coastline slowly recede from view. He was joined by members of his retinue, though he did not speak to any of them.

"Bellerophon" anchored off <a href="Brixham">Brixham</a> on the morning of 24 July, and there Maitland received orders from Admiral <a href="George%20Keith%20Elphinstone%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Keith">Lord Keith</a> to "prevent every person whatever from coming on board the ship you command, except the officers and men who compose her crew." Despite turning away the shore boats which approached the anchored warship bringing fresh bread and fruit to sell, word eventually leaked out that Napoleon was aboard the ship. The news created a sensation, and large numbers of boats filled with sightseers soon surrounded the ship. Occasionally Napoleon would come out to look at them, but despite entreaties from some people to be allowed on board, Maitland refused to allow any contact between ship and shore. On 26 July "Bellerophon" received orders to proceed to Plymouth harbour where Lord Keith was anchored aboard his flagship . Napoleon remained on board "Bellerophon" and the ship was kept isolated from the throngs of curious sightseers by two <a href="guardship">guardship</a>s, and , anchored close at hand.

"Bellerophon" spent two weeks in Plymouth harbour while the authorities came to a decision about what to do with Napoleon. On 31 July they communicated their decision to the former emperor. Napoleon was to be exiled to the remote island of <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a>. He would be allowed to take three officers, his surgeon, and twelve servants. Napoleon, who had hoped to be allowed to settle quietly in Britain, was bitterly disappointed by the news. "Bellerophon" was not to take him into exile. The Admiralty was concerned that the ageing ship was unsuitable for the long voyage to the South Atlantic, and the 74-gun was selected for the task. On 4 August, Lord Keith ordered "Bellerophon" to go to sea and await the arrival of HMS "Northumberland". On 7 August Napoleon thanked Maitland and his crew for their kindness and hospitality, and left "Bellerophon" where he had spent over three weeks without ever landing in England. He boarded "Northumberland", which then sailed for Saint Helena.

Captain Maitland's account of the time Napoleon spent on board his ship was published in 1826.

Having discharged Napoleon, "Bellerophon" sailed to Sheerness, and anchored there on 2 September. There she was paid off for the last time, and stripped of her guns and masts. With no further need for many ships following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, "Bellerophon" joined a number of ships laid up in this manner. A report on 16 October 1815 advised moving a number of convicts previously housed aboard the former into more suitable accommodation. The report suggested that "The class of ship, which I take the liberty of observing as most suitable for this service, would be a <a href="Seventy-four%20%28ship%29">seventy-four</a>, of about the same dimensions as the "Bellerophon" in the river Medway, being of easy draft of water and lofty between decks." The report was approved and the suggestion acted upon. "Bellerophon" was taken into <a href="Sheerness%20Dockyard">Sheerness Dockyard</a> in December 1815 and spent nine months fitting out as a <a href="prison%20ship">prison ship</a>.

The work was completed at a cost of £12,081 and the prisoners were transferred in January 1817. "Bellerophon" generally held around 435 prisoners during her time in this role, although in 1823 changes in legislation resulted in the adult prisoners being transferred out of "Bellerophon" and the ship instead being used to house boy prisoners, with 320 arriving in early 1824. In 1824 the decision was taken to rename , an 80-gun ship launched in 1818, HMS "Bellerophon". To free the name, the former HMS "Bellerophon" was renamed "Captivity" on 5 October 1824. She continued as a prison ship for boys until early 1826, when it was decided that the arrangement of the internal spaces made her unsuitable for workshops. The boys were transferred to another hulk, the former , and it was decided to move "Captivity" to Plymouth. The ship was taken into Sheerness Dockyard in April 1826, and was fitted out for the journey to Plymouth. She arrived there in June and spent the last eight years of her working existence as a convict hulk in Plymouth. By 1834 the rate of <a href="penal%20transportation">penal transportation</a> had been drastically increased to clear out the old hulks. When the last convicts had left "Captivity", she was handed back to the <a href="Navy%20Board">Navy Department</a>, who put her up for sale.

The Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland gave notice that they would offer several vessels for sale on 21 January 1836, including "Captivity", of 1613 tons, then lying at Plymouth. She sold on that day for £4,030. Advertisements in the local "Plymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse News" in September 1836 announced the auctioning off of her timber.

Some of "Bellerophon"s timber was bought at auction by George Bellamy, who had been "Bellerophon"s <a href="Ship%27s%20doctor">surgeon</a> at the Nile. Bellamy incorporated them into a cottage he was building at <a href="Plymstock">Plymstock</a>. Captain Maitland bought part of her figurehead and some of her stern ornaments, later depositing them in the collections of what eventually became the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Museum">Royal Naval Museum</a>. The <a href="National%20Maritime%20Museum">National Maritime Museum</a> holds several relics relating to "Bellerophon" and the people connected with her, including Captain John Cooke's <a href="dirk">dirk</a>, sword and pistol, and a trophy presented to Admiral Pasley by <a href="Lloyd%27s%20of%20London">Lloyd's of London</a>. Their collections also contain artefacts relating to her connection with Napoleon, including the couch from Maitland's cabin, and the skull of a goat which supplied milk for Napoleon and his suite.

The ship and her crew feature, or are mentioned, in several historical novels set during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, including several of the <a href="Aubrey%E2%80%93Maturin%20series">Aubrey–Maturin series</a> of novels by <a href="Patrick%20O%27Brian">Patrick O'Brian</a>, and the novel "<a href="Sharpe%27s%20Trafalgar">Sharpe's Trafalgar</a>" by <a href="Bernard%20Cornwell">Bernard Cornwell</a>.

"Bellerophon" appears in a number of artworks, including several depicting the ship's role in Napoleon's surrender. <a href="William%20Quiller%20Orchardson">Sir William Quiller Orchardson</a> painted "Napoleon on the Bellerophon", depicting the former emperor standing on the poop deck, watching the French coastline recede as his retinue look on. <a href="Charles%20Lock%20Eastlake">Sir Charles Lock Eastlake</a> painted a portrait of Napoleon in uniform, standing on "Bellerophon"s deck, while <a href="John%20James%20Chalon">John James Chalon</a> produced "Scene in Plymouth Sound in August 1815", a <a href="seascape">seascape</a>, with "Bellerophon" surrounded by crowds of people in small boats. <a href="Thomas%20Luny">Thomas Luny</a> painted a similar scene, showing "Bellerophon" putting into Torbay to rendezvous with HMS "Northumberland". Numerous popular prints and engravings were also produced, depicting moments from Napoleon's arrival on "Bellerophon" to surrender, to his final transfer to "Northumberland" for his voyage into exile. The ship also appears in prints and paintings of the battles she had fought in. She is depicted on the Cadiz blockade with the rest of the inshore squadron in a work by <a href="Thomas%20Buttersworth">Thomas Buttersworth</a>, and is visible at the Glorious First of June in works by <a href="Nicholas%20Pocock">Nicholas Pocock</a>, Cornwallis's Retreat by <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28artist%29">William Anderson</a>, and the Battles of the Nile and Trafalgar by <a href="Thomas%20Whitcombe">Thomas Whitcombe</a>.

"Bellerophon" is mentioned in several verses in a song commemorating Cornwallis's Retreat in 1795, which celebrate both Cornwallis (referred to by sailors' popular nickname for him, "Billy Blue"), and "Bellerophon"s fighting record at the Glorious First of June. The folk song "Boney was a Warrior", about the life of Napoleon, includes a verse celebrating the ship's links with his ultimate surrender.Boney went a-cruisin'"Way-aye-yah!"Aboard the Billy Ruffian"Johnny Franswor!"

a. This revived design is sometimes referred to as the "Edgar" class.

b. Greaves had originally approached the Navy Board in December 1781 with a proposal to build a 64-gun ship at his yard at <a href="Limehouse">Limehouse</a>, and a 74-gun ship and a frigate at Frindsbury. The Board turned him down, feeling that the Limehouse yard was unsuitable for building anything larger than a 44-gun ship, and that the Frindsbury yard was too close to the Navy's own shipbuilding facilities at Chatham. Commercial yards paid higher wages than the Navy's yards and the Board was concerned skilled workmen would be poached from Chatham. Greaves promised not to employ men from the Chatham yard, and the Board decided to offer him the contract for a 74-gun ship on 8 January 1782. Greaves signed the contract on 19 February 1782.

c. To build and fit "Bellerophon" for service required 2,000 trees (amounting to 50 acres), 100 tons of iron bolts, 30 tons of copper bolts, 30,000 <a href="treenail">treenail</a>s, 4,000 copper sheets, 12 tons of tar, 400 gallons of <a href="linseed%20oil">linseed oil</a>, 5 tons of paint, 10,000 square yards of canvas, 80 tons of shot, 20 tons of gunpowder, 200 tons of provisions and 260 tons of fresh water.

d. Sources agree that four men were killed, but while Winfield and Goodwin report twenty-seven wounded, Cordingly has the slightly higher figure of thirty wounded.

e. Darby may have intended to anchor alongside the 80-gun <a href="HMS%20Canopus%20%281798%29">"Franklin"</a>, the ship immediately ahead of "Orient", or to have tacked alongside the gap between "Franklin" and "Orient", so as to be able to rake "Orient"s bows. Cordingly considers that the reason for the ultimate positioning was never explained. Adkin prefers the explanation that Darby intended to rake "Orient"s bows, but the anchor had dragged.

f. This was among the highest casualty figures of any of the British ships. Only the 50 dead and 143 wounded of HMS "Majestic" was comparable. "Bellerophon"s total casualty list of 197 was slightly higher than "Majestic"s 193, and amounted to nearly a quarter of the total British casualties in the battle. Robert Cathcart, as the senior surviving lieutenant, was recommended for promotion by Earl St Vincent, a recommendation the Admiralty accepted, advancing him to commander.

g. Cumby shared in the rewards after Trafalgar. He was promoted twice in rapid succession, to commander on 24 December 1805, and to <a href="post-captain">post-captain</a> on 1 January 1806.

Inaccessible Island rail

The Inaccessible Island rail ("Atlantisia rogersi") is a small bird of the rail <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, <a href="Rallidae">Rallidae</a>. It is the <a href="Monotypic%20taxon">only species</a> in the <a href="genus">genus</a> Atlantisia. <a href="Endemic">Endemic</a> to <a href="Inaccessible%20Island">Inaccessible Island</a> in the <a href="Tristan%20Archipelago">Tristan Archipelago</a> in the isolated south Atlantic, it is notable for being the smallest extant <a href="flightless%20bird">flightless bird</a> in the world. The species was <a href="species%20description">described</a> by physician <a href="Percy%20Lowe">Percy Lowe</a> in 1923 but had first come to the attention of scientists 50 years earlier. The Inaccessible Island rail's affinities were a long-standing mystery; in 2018 its closest relative was identified as the South American <a href="dot-winged%20crake">dot-winged crake</a> ("Porzana spiloptera"), both of which are nested within the genus "<a href="Laterallus">Laterallus</a>".

A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage, black bill and feet, and adults have a red eye. It occupies most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for incubating the eggs and raising the chicks. Its <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a>s to living on a tiny island at high densities include low <a href="base%20metabolic%20rate">base metabolic rate</a>s, small <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> sizes, and flightlessness.

Unlike many other oceanic islands, Inaccessible Island has remained free from <a href="introduced%20predators">introduced predators</a>, allowing this species to flourish while many other flightless birds, particularly flightless rails, have gone extinct. The species is nevertheless considered <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), due to its single small population, which would be threatened by the accidental introduction of mammalian predators such as rats or cats.

Although the Inaccessible Island rail may have been known to the <a href="Tristan%20da%20Cunha">Tristan Islanders</a> who visited the island annually to hunt seals, the species first came to the attention of scientists during the <a href="Challenger%20expedition">"Challenger" expedition</a> of 1872–1876. When the expedition visited the island in October 1873, Sir <a href="Charles%20Wyville%20Thomson">Charles Wyville Thomson</a> learned of the species and recorded observations made by two German brothers, the Stoltenhoffs, who had been living on the island for the last two years. Thomson was unable to collect a specimen, much to his regret.

Another attempt was made to collect a specimen by <a href="Earl%20of%20Crawford">Lord Crawford</a> on his yacht "Valhalla" in 1905. A final attempt was made during the <a href="Shackleton%E2%80%93Rowett%20Expedition">Shackleton–Rowett Expedition</a>, which passed by in April 1922 on its way back to Britain. This visit also failed, but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two <a href="study%20skin">study skin</a>s arrived in the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum, London</a>, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician <a href="Percy%20Lowe">Percy Lowe</a> was then able to use the skins to describe the species. He did so, briefly, at a meeting of the <a href="British%20Ornithologists%27%20Club">British Ornithologists' Club</a>, in 1923.

Prior to its collection it had been assumed by Thomson that the species was close to the other "island hens" known in the Atlantic, possibly a <a href="gallinule">gallinule</a>, but on examination Lowe felt "compelled to refer it to a new genus". The generic name "Atlantisia" was named for the mythical island of <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, destroyed by a volcano. The specific name "rogersi" honours the Rev. Rogers, who collected and sent the first specimens of the species to Lowe.

In his 1928 paper on the species, Lowe thought that the Inaccessible Island rail was the descendant of flightless ancestors which had reached Inaccessible Island via a <a href="land%20bridge">land bridge</a> or sunken continent such as <a href="Lemuria%20%28continent%29">Lemuria</a>. Land bridges were commonly invoked to explain biogeographical distribution patterns before the development and acceptance of <a href="plate%20tectonics">plate tectonics</a>. By 1955 it was understood that the rail was the descendant of ancestors that had flown to Inaccessible Island. It was also presumed that like most other land birds of the Tristan Archipelago (except the <a href="Tristan%20moorhen">Tristan moorhen</a> "Gallinula nesiotis" and the Gough moorhen "G. comeri"), it had probably reached the island from ancestors in South America.

The position of the Inaccessible Island rail in the larger rail family (<a href="Rallidae">Rallidae</a>) has long been a source of uncertainty. Lowe thought that its closest relatives may have been <a href="black%20crake">black crake</a> of Africa, or perhaps an early offshoot of the genus "<a href="Porphyrio">Porphyrio</a>" (swamphens), a conclusion based mostly on similarities of plumage. He did concede that it was difficult to assign the rail to any relatives. American paleontologist <a href="Storrs%20Olson">Storrs Olson</a> suggested in 1973 that it was related to the ""Rallus" assemblage", which included the genera "<a href="Rallus">Rallus</a>" and "<a href="Hypotaenidia">Hypotaenidia</a>" (now lumped with "<a href="Gallirallus">Gallirallus</a>"), based on the structure of the skeleton. In particular he suggested it was part of a pro-"Rallus" group that included the Indian Ocean genus "<a href="Dryolimnas">Dryolimnas</a>", and the Australasian "<a href="Lewinia">Lewinia</a>". Olson suggested the pro-"Rallus" rails have a <a href="relict%20distribution">relict distribution</a> and would have been present in Africa and South America, where the ancestors of the Inaccessible Island rail came from. The most recent comparative morphological study to include the genus, in 1998, placed it in a subtribe Crecina of the crakes. Its exact position could not be determined, but it was suggested to perhaps be the <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> to the genus "<a href="Laterallus">Laterallus</a>", a genus of small crakes found mostly in South America. 

Two extinct flightless species of rail were at one time placed in the genus "Atlantisia" with the Inaccessible Island rail. The <a href="Ascension%20crake">Ascension crake</a> ("Mundia elpenor") and the <a href="Saint%20Helena%20swamphen">Saint Helena swamphen</a> ("Aphanocrex podarces") were once considered congeners of "A. rogersi". The Ascension crake disappeared some time before 1700 but was briefly mentioned and described by traveller and hobby naturalist <a href="Peter%20Mundy">Peter Mundy</a> in 1656. The Saint Helena swamphen disappeared before 1600 and has never been encountered alive by scientists. In 1973 Olson synonymised the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Aphanocrex" with the genus "Atlantisia", and described the Ascension crake as being congeneric. Today they are considered to have evolved independently (with "A. podarces" probably not even being closely related), and in 2003 the genus "Mundia" was erected and the Saint Helena swamphen moved back to "Aphanocrex", leaving the Inaccessible Island rail the only species in the genus "Atlantisia". Both the Ascension crake and the Saint Helena swamphen became extinct due to <a href="predation">predation</a> by <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a>, mainly <a href="cat">cat</a>s and <a href="rat">rat</a>s.

Stervander "et al". (2018) resolved the taxonomic affinity and evolutionary history of the Inaccessible Island rail by <a href="phylogenetic%20analyses">phylogenetic analyses</a> of the <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> of its full <a href="mitochondrial%20genome">mitochondrial genome</a> and a handful mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers. According to this study, the Inaccessible Island rail belongs to a clade comprising its sister species, the <a href="dot-winged%20crake">dot-winged crake</a>, the <a href="black%20rail">black rail</a> ("Laterallus jamaicensis") in America, and most likely the <a href="Galapagos%20crake">Galápagos crake</a> ("Laterallus spilonota"), therefore suggested referring the Inaccessible Island rail to the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Laterallus">Laterallus</a>". It colonized Inaccessible Island from South America c. 1.5 million years ago.

The Inaccessible Island rail is the smallest living flightless bird in the world, measuring . Males are larger and heavier than females, weighing , average , compared to , average , in females. It is dark chestnut-brown above and dark grey on the head and below, with degraded white barring on the flanks and belly, and adults have a red eye. The female is similar to the male but with paler grey and a faint brown wash on the underparts. It has a black <a href="beak">bill</a>, which is shorter than the head. The <a href="feather">feather</a>s of the Inaccessible Island rail are almost hair-like, and in particular the <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s are degenerate, as the barbules on many of the feathers (but not all, as has sometimes been reported) fail to interlock, giving the feathers a ragged appearance. The wings are reduced and weak, and smaller than same-sized flying relatives, as is the sternum. The tail is short, in length, and the and are nearly as long as the tail .

The Inaccessible Island rail has a low <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a> (BMR), measured in 1989 at around 60–68% the rate expected for a bird of its weight. The scientists responsible for the study speculated that the low BMR was not as a result of flightlessness, which does not have this effect in other bird species, but was instead the result of the rail's island lifestyle. The island lacks predators and other competitors, and as such can be expected to be at full <a href="carrying%20capacity">carrying capacity</a> for rails. This in turn would favour energy conservation by the rails, resulting in small body size, low BMR and flightlessness. A comparison of flighted and flightless rails, including the Inaccessible Island rail, found that rails that lose the ability to fly also have low BMRs.

The Inaccessible rail is <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the uninhabited Inaccessible Island in the <a href="Tristan%20da%20Cunha">Tristan da Cunha</a> group in the mid-Atlantic Ocean. The island is in area and has a temperate wet <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic climate</a> with high rainfall, limited sunshine and persistent westerly winds. The rail is found in almost all habitats on the island and at all altitudes, from sea-level to . It reaches its highest densities in fields of tussock grass ("<a href="Spartina">Spartina arundinacea</a>"), with 10 birds per hectare, and in tussock grass mixed with ferns ("<a href="Blechnum%20penna-marina">Blechnum penna-marina</a>") and sedges, with 15 birds per hectare. This habitat is found close to the shore and surrounds most of the island on the steep cliffs. The Inaccessible Island rail can also be found in upland fern-bush heath, dominated by wind-stunted tree-ferns ("<a href="Blechnum%20palmiforme">Blechnum palmiforme</a>") and in the island forest in the central plateau which is dominated by Island Cape myrtle ("<a href="Phylica%20arborea">Phylica arborea</a>")—which can reach where sheltered—and "Blechnum palmiforme". In both these habitats the population is estimated to be two birds per hectare. It will also forage among boulders on the beaches, but has not been found in the short dry grasses on the <a href="cinder%20cone">cinder cone</a>s (the scientists making the observations cautioned that this does not mean that they never use the habitat). It frequently uses natural cavities among boulders or tunnels through grasses created by frequent use to move around while concealed.

The Inaccessible Island rail is <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a>, and the territories they defend are tiny. The territories in the tussock grass habitats around Blenden Hall, where the population densities are highest, extend to . The small size of the territories makes encounters between families and individuals frequent, and confrontations and territorial calling are common. On meeting, confrontations start with loud trills or twittering, then birds may face off, standing very close to each other and displaying ritually with their heads lowered and their bills pointed towards the ground. They may circle, and continue displaying until one bird slowly retreats or a quick skirmish ensues and one bird is driven off.

The foraging method used by the Inaccessible Island rail is slow and deliberate and has been compared to that of a mouse, and the bird occupies a similar <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>. They feed on a range of invertebrates, including earthworms, amphipods, isopods, mites and a range of insects such as beetles, flies, moths and caterpillars. Centipedes are taken as well, and an introduced species of centipede forms an important part of their diet. Along with animal prey they will take the berries of "<a href="Empetrum">Empetrum</a>" and "<a href="Nertera">Nertera</a>" as well as the seeds of the dock "<a href="Rumex">Rumex</a>". Unlike the <a href="Tristan%20thrush">Tristan thrush</a> they do not feed on carrion or dead fish.

The Inaccessible Island rail is a highly vocal species, calling frequently. This may be because of the dense vegetation the species lives in, making calls the best way to communicate, and pairs and families frequently while feeding. Calls used include a long trill used when pairs meet and when confronting a rival. Rivals also make a long twitter "keekeekeekeekee" which can be long and short and end in a "keekeechitrrrr". After skirmishes between rivals the victorious bird may make a "weechup weechup" call. Birds may make a monotonous "tchik tchik tchok tchik" while hunting for prey, and the alarm call when predators are around is a short and hard "chip". They also make a variety of trilling calls while incubating, particularly when pairs swap places during incubation. Before changing places the incubating bird may make a "chip chip chip", but they fall silent when Tristan thrushes approach the nest.

The Inaccessible Island rail is a seasonal breeder, laying between October and January. They are monogamous, forming permanent pair-bonds. The nests are situated at the base of ferns with tussock grass, tussock grass clumps, or in tufts of sedges. The nests are domed and oval or pear shaped, with the entrances near the narrow end of the nest and linked by a track or tunnel that can go up to half a metre away. The nests are typically built entirely of the same material the nest is found in; for example, tussock grass or sedges. Where the construction material is tussock grass, larger leaves are used on the outside and finer material lines the nest. There are a few reports of other material being used as lining, such as the leaves of introduced "<a href="Malus%20domestica">Malus domestica</a>" (apple) or "<a href="Salix%20babylonica">Salix babylonica</a>" (willow).

The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> size is two eggs, which is low for such small rails. The eggs are greyish milk white dotted with brown-rufous spots and lavender-mauve spots that are concentrated around the apex of the egg. They are large for the size of the mother compared to other rails, and resemble the eggs of the <a href="corn%20crake">corn crake</a>.

The incubation period for the species is not known, but both sexes incubate the clutch, although the males incubated for longer in the observations that have been made. Both sexes bring food to their partner that is incubating, which is either consumed on the nest or close to the nest. Changeovers of incubation details are preceded by "chip chip chip" calls, which become louder and more frequent the longer its takes the partner to respond.

The eggs hatch within between 23 and 32 hours of each other and can be preceded by the chick in the egg calling for up to 45 hours before hatching. One hatching was recorded as taking 15 hours to complete. Newly hatched chicks are covered by downy black plumage, the legs, feet and bill are black, and the mouth is silvery.

Lowe speculated in his 1927 paper that, in the absence of mammalian predators on the island, the <a href="brown%20skua">brown skua</a> would be the Inaccessible Island rail's only predator. A study of the diet of brown skuas on Inaccessible Island confirmed this, but found that although skuas do eat adults of this species, the rail and other landbirds formed only a small part of the diet of that seabird, especially compared to their abundance on the island. They noted that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen. After hearing another rail make an alarm call, adult Inaccessible Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent. Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause of death.

Two species of <a href="Mallophaga">chewing lice</a> have been found on Inaccessible Island rails, "Pscudomenopon scopulacorne" and "<a href="Rallicola">Rallicola</a> (Parricola) zumpti". "R. zumpti" has not been described on any other species of bird from Inaccessible Island. "P. scopulacorne" found on the Inaccessible Island rail were originally described as a new species, "P. rowani" (Keler, 1951), but were later lumped into the widespread species in 1974.

The Inaccessible Island rail has a tiny global range with a single population. Though still common within its tiny range, with around 5,600 adult birds in the world, the species is considered to be vulnerable if an invasive species were to reach Inaccessible Island. Insular rails, particularly flightless species, are vulnerable to extinction. House mice, feral cats and brown rats, all of which would be a serious threat to this species, are not present on the island, nor have they ever been, but are present on nearby Tristan da Cunha, and could reach the islands via fishing vessels or other boats visiting the island (mice have been found on boats visiting the neighbouring Nightingale Island). Because of this vulnerability, this species is rated as <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> by the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. Fires of tussock grass, which were recorded in 1872 and 1909, are assumed to have killed large numbers of rails, but have not occurred since. In the 1950s they were highly sought after for scientific collections, but permits to do so were rarely granted.

Several conservation measures have been undertaken or proposed to protect this species. Inaccessible Island was once suggested as a site for agriculture for Tristan Islanders, which would have reduced habitat and risked the introduction of invasive species. However the island was declared a nature reserve by the <a href="Tristan%20da%20Cunha%20Island%20Council">Tristan da Cunha Island Council</a> in 1994. Access to the island is restricted now, although Tristan Islanders are still permitted to visit the island to collect firewood and guano. Introduced <a href="New%20Zealand%20flax">New Zealand flax</a> has been removed from the island, and the island now has a management plan. Other suggestions for securing this species' future include increased education on <a href="biosecurity">biosecurity</a> for the local community, and potentially setting up a captive population. It has also been suggested that backup populations be established on other secure islands, for example Nightingale Island, in case predators reached Inaccessible Island, but this may have negative impacts on the endemic invertebrate faunas of these islands.

Red-billed tropicbird

The red-billed tropicbird ("Phaethon aethereus") is a <a href="tropicbird">tropicbird</a>, one of three closely related species of <a href="seabird">seabird</a> of tropical oceans. Superficially resembling a <a href="tern">tern</a> in appearance, it has mostly white plumage with some black markings on the wings and back, a black mask and, as its suggests, a red bill. Most adults have that are about two times their body length, with those in males being generally longer than those in females. The red-billed tropicbird itself has three subspecies recognized, including the <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate</a>. The subspecies "mesonauta" is distinguished from the nominate by the rosy tinge of its fresh plumage, and the subspecies "indicus" can be differentiated by its smaller size, more restricted mask, and more orange bill. This species ranges across the tropical <a href="Atlantic%20%28ocean%29">Atlantic</a>, eastern <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a>, and <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>s. The nominate is found in the southern Atlantic Ocean, the subspecies "indicus" in the waters off of the Middle East and in the Indian Ocean, and the subspecies "mesonauta" in the eastern portions of both the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans and in the Caribbean. It was one of the many species described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his 1758 <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition of "Systema Naturae"</a>.

Nesting takes place in loose <a href="bird%20colony">colonies</a>, as they nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid and is incubated by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, which are then seized by the tropicbird.

In some areas, introduced <a href="black%20rat">black</a> and <a href="brown%20rat">brown rat</a>s raid nests for eggs and young. Cats also threaten the red-billed tropicbird. This bird is considered to be a <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern species</a> according to the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), though populations are thought to be declining. In some places, such as Brazil and Mexico, this bird is considered to be threatened.

English naturalist <a href="Francis%20Willughby">Francis Willughby</a> wrote about the red-billed tropicbird in the 17th century, having seen a specimen held by the Royal Society. It was one of the many <a href="Aves%20in%20the%2010th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">bird species originally described</a> by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in the landmark 1758 <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition</a> of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>", and still bears its original scientific name, "Phaethon aethereus". The genus name is derived from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "phaethon", "sun" while the species name comes from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "aetherius", "heavenly". This bird is called the red-billed tropicbird due to its red bill and its location in the tropicbird genus. An alternative common name was "bosun bird", also spelt "boatswain bird", from the similarity of its shrill call to a <a href="boatswain">boatswain</a>'s whistle. An alternative derivation of the name is from the semblance of the tail feathers to marlin spikes. Local names used in the West Indies include "truphit", "trophic", "white bird", "paille-en-queue", "paille-en-cul", "flèche-en-cul", and "fétu". In a 1945 paper, American ornithologist <a href="Waldo%20Lee%20McAtee">Waldo Lee McAtee</a> proposed it be called the barred-backed tropicbird after its most distinguishing feature.

The red-billed tropicbird is <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> (the earliest offshoot) in the genus "<a href="Phaethon%20%28genus%29">Phaethon</a>", the sole extant genus in the family <a href="Phaethontidae">Phaethontidae</a>, the tropicbirds. The split between this tropicbird and the other tropicbirds, the <a href="red-tailed%20tropicbird">red-tailed</a> and <a href="white-tailed%20tropicbird">white-tailed tropicbird</a>, is thought to have occurred about six million years ago.

There are three subspecies, including the nominate, of this tropicbird:

The red-billed tropicbird measures on average, which includes the -long . Without them the tropicbird measures about . It has a wingspan of . In overall appearance it is <a href="tern">tern</a>-like in shape. Its plumage is white, with black wing tips, and a back that is finely barred in black. It has a black mask that extends up from just above the <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a> to the sides of its nape, with gray <a href="Mottle">mottling</a> usually seen near the nape and hindneck. The tail has black shaft streaks, as do tail streamers. The are white, with some black on the outermost <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">primaries</a> and <a href="Flight%20feather%23Tertial">tertials</a> and occasionally with black markings on the flanks. The iris is blackish-brown, and the bill is red. The legs, base of the central toe, and parts of the outer toes are orange-yellow while the rest of the feet are black. Although the sexes are similar, the males are generally larger than females, with the tail streamers being around longer on the male than on the female.

The subspecies of this bird can usually be distinguished by their difference in size and plumage. The subspecies "Phaethon aethereus mesonauta" can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the bolder look of the black barring on the upper wing, and the more solid look of the black on the outer wing. The subspecies "P. a. indicus" can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend far behind the eye, and its more orange bill with a black cutting edge.
When the chicks hatch, they are covered with gray down. This down is eventually cleared in about 40 to 50 days. The young chicks lack tail streamers. The juvenile looks similar to the adult with a mostly white crown. In the juvenile, the stripes above the eye usually are connected at the nape. The tail feathers usually have black tips or subterminal dots and without the tail streamers that are distinctive on the adult. Occasionally, a juvenile will have black markings on its flanks and under tail coverts.

The red-billed tropicbird can be differentiated from the other tropicbirds by its red bill in combination with its white tail streamers. The slightly smaller red-tailed tropicbird has red rather than white tail streamers, and the white-tailed tropicbird can be differentiated by its smaller size, black stripe along its upper wing coverts, and its yellow-orange bill. Juvenile red-billed tropicbirds have more heavily barred upper parts than juveniles of other species. In flight, the <a href="royal%20tern">royal tern</a> can be confused with the adult red-billed tropicbird but can be distinguished by the former's less direct flight pattern and its lack of tail streamers.

This tropicbird moults once every year as an adult, following a complex basic strategy. This is completed before courtship and lasts between 19 and 29 weeks, with most being completed in 24 weeks. Birds gain their adult plumage at two to three years of age.

The red-billed tropicbird usually only calls near breeding <a href="bird%20colony">colonies</a>, where it joins in with groups of other adults, numbering from 2 to 20, in circling above the sea and making loud, harsh "kreeeee-kreeeee-kri-kri-kri-kr" screams. If disturbed at the nest, the chicks will vocalize a loud and piercing shriek, either rasping or reeling.

The red-billed tropicbird has the smallest range of the three tropicbird species, yet it still ranges across the <a href="Neotropics">Neotropics</a>, as well as the tropical <a href="Atlantic%20%28ocean%29">Atlantic</a>, eastern <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a>, and <a href="Indian%20ocean">Indian ocean</a>s. The nominate subspecies "Phaethon aethereus aethereus" breeds on islands in the Atlantic south of the equator, including <a href="Ascension%20Island">Ascension</a>, and <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> on the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>, and <a href="Fernando%20de%20Noronha">Fernando de Noronha</a> and <a href="Abrolhos%20Archipelago">Abrolhos Archipelago</a> in Brazilian waters. It is a vagrant to the coastline of Namibia and South Africa. The subspecies "P. a. mesonauta" is found in the east Atlantic, the east Pacific, and in the Caribbean. This subspecies was restricted to the <a href="Cape%20Verde%20Islands">Cape Verde Islands</a> in the eastern Atlantic but it has colonised the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> in the 21st Century, especially <a href="Fuerteventura">Fuerteventura</a> but also on other islands in that archipelago. The Indian Ocean subspecies, "P. a. indicus" is found in waters off Pakistan, western India, southwestern Sri Lanka, the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula. The subspecies is also a rare but regular vagrant to <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a>.

Within the West Indies, this species is most common in the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>, Virgin Islands and small islands east of Puerto Rico. Breeding in the <a href="Western%20Palearctic">Western Palearctic</a> occurs on the <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> Islands and the <a href="%C3%8Eles%20des%20Madeleines">Îles des Madeleines</a> off <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>. In 2000, the total number of pairs there was probably less than 150. In the Pacific Ocean, it breeds from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20California">Gulf of California</a> and <a href="Revillagigedo%20Islands">Revillagigedo Islands</a>, Mexico in the north, to the <a href="Galapagos%20Islands">Galapagos Islands</a>, Isla Plata, Ecuador and <a href="San%20Lorenzo%20Island%20%28Peru%29">San Lorenzo Island</a>, Peru. Researchers Larry Spear and David Ainley estimated the minimum population of the Pacific at around 15,750 birds in 1995 after 15 years of field observations. Red-billed tropicbirds disperse widely when not breeding, the juveniles more so than the adults, with birds in the Pacific reaching the <a href="45th%20parallel%20north">45th parallel north</a> off Washington State and <a href="32nd%20parallel%20south">32nd parallel south</a> off Chile, with 19 records as of 2007 from Hawaii—some from Mexico. It sometimes wanders further, including five records from <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, and two from Australia: October–December 2010 on Lord Howe Island and September 2014 on <a href="Ashmore%20and%20Cartier%20Islands">Ashmore Reef</a>. In July 2005, one was found in eastern <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, while another has been seen at <a href="Matinicus%20Rock%20Light">Matinicus Rock</a>, <a href="Maine">Maine</a> regularly since 2000.

The red-billed tropicbird can reach speeds of when flying out at sea, cruising a minimum of above the sea. It cannot stand and is not proficient at walking, and requires an unobstructed takeoff to fly from land. Conversely it can lift off the sea without much effort. Its plumage is waterproof and it floats on water.

The red-billed tropicbird usually nests on isolated cliff faces, in loose colonies. It uses a simple <a href="scrape%20nest">scrape nest</a>, located in a place it can easily take off from. The age of first breeding is usually five years, although this age is variable; a three-year-old tropicbird was once seen breeding. In some locations, breeding happens year-round, while in others, breeding occurs seasonally. For example, for islands in the <a href="California%20Current">California Current</a>, breeding starts in November or December, while it occurs year-round in the Galapagos. Breeding is influenced by the availability of food, with an increase in food generally causing an increase in breeding. Individually, this bird only breeds every nine to twelve months. A breeding bird usually returns to its partner and nest location from the previous breeding cycle.
Courtship and pairing usually lasts three to five weeks, during which this bird performs aerial courtship displays to potential mates. The courtship displays include flying in the air which takes the form of gliding interspersed with short periods of rapid wing-beating. In one display, a pair glide together for , with one bird around above the other. The upper bird bends its wings down and the lower lifts its up, so they are almost touching. The two sink to about above the sea before breaking off.

At nest sites, battles sometimes occur between two or more pairs before the original owners declare themselves as the owner of the nest. Red-billed tropicbirds are aggressive at nest sites, fighting with each other and ousting species such as <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s, <a href="petrel">petrel</a>s, and white-tailed tropicbirds. They have also been recorded taking over nests of white-tailed tropicbirds and raising their young if they failed to destroy their eggs. Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds have been implicated in egg loss in red-tailed tropicbird nests in Hawaii.

This tropicbird usually lays a <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of one white buff to pale purple egg with reddish-brown spots. The egg usually measures and weighs around —10% of the adult female's weight. It is incubated by both sexes for 42 to 46 days. If the egg does not survive the first few days in the nest, the female will usually lay a replacement egg. The chicks that hatch eventually fledge in about 10 to 15 weeks after hatching, although most fledge after about 80 to 90 days. Normally, the maximum weight of the chicks is about , but on years that are hotter than average, this can drop to about .

Born helpless and unable to move around (<a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a> and semi-<a href="altricial">altricial</a>), the chicks are constantly brooded by the parents until they are 3 to 5 days old, when they can thermoregulate their body temperature. They grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 13–15 days, followed by primaries at 24–27 days, tail feathers at 30–35 days and are fully feathered by 55 days. They are attended by the parents more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of the chicks during those days. Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food. The parents can be seen at normal rates with the chicks up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance by the parents falls rapidly. Chicks receive no care after fledging, with only about one out of seven chicks receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no chicks are visited after about 90 days. After fledging, the chicks will leave the nest, with few remaining after about 100 days.

Although it is a poor swimmer, the red-billed tropicbird feeds on fish and squid. The fish are usually small, between about , although some caught are up to . The aquatic prey is mostly caught by diving into the water from the air, although <a href="flying%20fish">flying fish</a>, the preferred fish of this species, are sometimes caught while in the air. Fish species eaten include <a href="Pacific%20thread%20herring">Pacific thread herring</a> ("Opisthonema libertate"), <a href="Fodiator%20acutus">sharpchin flying fish</a> ("Fodiator acutus"), flying fish of the genus "<a href="Hirundichthys">Hirundichthys</a>", <a href="sailfin%20flyingfish">sailfin flying fish</a> ("Parexocoetus brachypterus"), <a href="ornamented%20flying%20fish">ornamented flying fish</a> ("Cypselurus callopterus"), bigwing halfbeak ("<a href="Oxyporhamphus%20micropterus">Oxyporhamphus micropterus</a>"), longfin halfbeak ("<a href="Hemiramphus%20saltator">Hemiramphus saltator</a>"), tropical two-wing flying fish ("Exocoetus volitans"), redlip blenny ("<a href="Ophioblennius%20atlanticus">Ophioblennius atlanticus</a>"), squirrelfish ("<a href="Holocentrus%20adscensionis">Holocentrus adscensionis</a>"), <a href="mackerel%20scad">mackerel scad</a> ("Decapterus macarellus"), <a href="shortjaw%20leatherjacket">shortjaw leatherjacket</a> ("Oligoplites refulgens"), and mackerels ("<a href="Scomber">Scomber</a>" spp.). Squid eaten include the glass squid ("<a href="Hyaloteuthis%20pelagica">Hyaloteuthis pelagica</a>").

As they grow, the chicks are fed increasingly larger quantities of fish and squid by their parents, generally partly digested and regurgitated. Most fish that the chicks are fed are below in length, although some fish fed to larger chicks can be up to in length.

This species of tropicbird usually forages alone. It usually dives into waters away from the coastline, diving from the air, at heights up to . It will usually hover over the water before diving. Sometimes, this bird follows predators that feed near the surface, such as <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>s or <a href="tuna">tuna</a>. The red-billed tropicbird will feed on the fish driven either to or above the surface by the aforementioned predators. It usually forages in warmer waters, though does hunt in areas of cooler currents such as the Gulf of California. The species has also been recorded foraging in <a href="Estuary%23Salt%20wedge">salt wedge</a> estuaries.

The red-billed tropicbird, a bird not indigenous to <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, was displayed in error on the $50 <a href="Bermudian%20dollar">Bermudian dollar</a> and was replaced in 2012 by the white-tailed tropicbird, the tropicbird that can be found in Bermuda.

Accurate assessment of red-billed tropicbird numbers is difficult due to the remote locations of nesting sites and vast areas of the sea where they might be found. This bird is considered to be a <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern species</a> according to the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a>. This is due to the fact that the range, declination, and numbers of this species, although small, do not meet the criteria required to be considered a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a>. The range of this species is believed to be , with an estimated 3,300 to 13,000 mature individuals. In the western Atlantic, a more precise number was given for the population there in 2000; about 4,000 to 5,000 pairs. The population is declining, mainly due to human exploitation of the bird's environment and predation by invasive species, such as rats. These predators have the potential to drive populations of the red-billed tropicbird into serious decline. It is estimated that this bird experienced a <a href="population%20bottleneck">population bottleneck</a> about 450 to 750 years ago, likely due to exploitation by humans. This has resulted in low genetic diversity in this tropicbird, which makes the likelihood of it adapting to sudden environmental changes low. In Mexico and Brazil, it is considered to be threatened.

The eggs and chicks of red-billed tropicbirds are prey for both <a href="brown%20rat">brown</a> and <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a>s in places like Abrolhos Archipelago, where these rats are invasive species. <a href="Feral%20cat">Feral cat</a>s are also predators of breeding tropicbirds, with the birds providing about 3% of the diet of the cats in locations such as the Caribbean island <a href="Saba">Saba</a>. On Saba, the problem has only arisen since about 2000. On Ascension Island, the effect of the eradication of feral cats was the increase of the red-billed tropicbird population there by about 1.6% in a year. On the Galapagos Islands, the <a href="short-eared%20owl">short-eared owl</a> ("Asio flammeus") occasionally eats young birds. "<a href="Toxoplasma%20gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a>", an <a href="intracellular">intracellular</a> <a href="parasite">parasite</a>, can be found in this bird. About 28% of red-billed tropicbirds produce antibodies for "T. gondii".

Under normal conditions about 75% of the eggs hatch. Hatching success can drop to about 35% in unusually hot conditions. Egg shell thinning, a potential cause of egg mortality, can be caused by pollutants. About 78% of chicks fledge in normal years, with that percentage only dropping slightly, to 77%, in abnormally hot years. Most egg and chick mortality during periods of normal climate is caused by nest fights between the parents and other birds. Breeding adults usually survive the year, with only about 18% dying every year. The young have a lower survival rate, with about 29% dying each year. The lifespan of this bird is anywhere from 16 to 30 years.

Melodifestivalen

Melodifestivalen (; literally "the Melody Festival") is an annual song competition organised by <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> public broadcasters <a href="Sveriges%20Television">Sveriges Television</a> (SVT) and <a href="Sveriges%20Radio">Sveriges Radio</a> (SR). It determines the country's representative for the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>, and has been staged almost every year since 1958. Since 2000, the competition has been the most popular television programme in Sweden; it is also broadcast on radio and the Internet. In 2012, the semi-finals averaged 3.3 million viewers, and over an estimated four million people in Sweden watched the final, almost half of the Swedish population.

The festival has produced six <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%20winners">Eurovision winners</a> and twenty four top-five placings for <a href="Sweden%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Sweden at the contest</a>. The winner of the Melodifestival has been chosen by panels of jurors since its inception. Since 1999, the juries have been joined by a public <a href="televoting">telephone vote</a> which has an equal influence over the final outcome. The competition makes a considerable impact on music charts in Sweden.

The introduction of semi-finals in 2002 raised the potential number of contestants from around twelve to thirty-two. A children's version of the competition, <a href="Lilla%20Melodifestivalen">Lilla Melodifestivalen</a>, also began that year. Light orchestrated pop songs, known locally as "<a href="schlager">schlager</a>" music, used to be so prevalent that the festival was sometimes referred to as "schlagerfestivalen" ("the schlager festival") or "schlager-sm" ("schlager Swedish championship") by the <a href="Media%20in%20Sweden">Swedish media</a>. However, other styles of music such as <a href="rap%20music">rap</a>, <a href="reggae%20music">reggae</a>, and <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a> have made an appearance since the event's expansion. The introduction of a grand final in Stockholm has attracted substantial tourism to the city.

With seven nations competing, the first <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> took place in <a href="Lugano">Lugano</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> in May 1956. Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a public selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send <a href="Alice%20Babs">Alice Babs</a> to the contest in <a href="Hilversum">Hilversum</a>, <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. The song selected was "Samma stjärna lyser för oss två" (The same stars shine for the two of us), later renamed "<a href="Lilla%20stj%C3%A4rna">Lilla stjärna</a>" (Little star). It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958.

The first Melodifestival, incorporated into the "Säg det med musik" radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at <a href="Cirkus%20%28Stockholm%29">Cirkus</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>; eight songs participated. Four "expert" juries in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, <a href="Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a>, and <a href="Lule%C3%A5">Luleå</a> decided the winner. The competition was won by <a href="Siw%20Malmkvist">Siw Malmkvist</a> performing "Augustin", but SR decided that the winning song—regardless of its original performer—would be performed by <a href="Brita%20Borg">Brita Borg</a> at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the "Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final". In the event's early years, it was broadcast to <a href="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> through the <a href="Nordvision">Nordvision</a> network. The competition adopted its current name, "Melodifestivalen", in 1967.

The Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, <a href="left-wing">left-wing</a> groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial "Alternativfestivalen". Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976, but returned in 1977.

Hundreds of songs and performers have entered Melodifestivalen since its debut. Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%23Semi-finals">Eurovision semi-final</a>.

Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when <a href="Elisabeth%20Andreassen">Elisabeth Andreassen</a> failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semi-finals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a>. A <a href="Compact%20disc">CD</a> of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a <a href="DVD">DVD</a> of the semi-finals and final since 2003.

Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a>, <a href="Tommy%20K%C3%B6rberg">Tommy Körberg</a>, and <a href="Lisa%20Nilsson">Lisa Nilsson</a>. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including <a href="Baccara">Baccara</a>, <a href="Alannah%20Myles">Alannah Myles</a>, <a href="Katrina%20Leskanich">Katrina Leskanich</a>, and <a href="Cornelis%20Vreeswijk">Cornelis Vreeswijk</a>. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, "Symfonin" by <a href="Loa%20Falkman">Loa Falkman</a>, topped the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with <a href="Samir%20%26amp%3B%20Viktor">Samir & Viktor</a>'s song "<a href="Bada%20Nakna">Bada Nakna</a>". In 2007, twenty-one participants reached "<a href="Sverigetopplistan">Sverigetopplistan</a>". The week after the 2008 final, songs from the festival made up the entire top fifteen on the domestic singles chart.

The process of narrowing thousands of potential entries down to twenty-eight lasts over seven months. SVT directly selects fourteen entries from amongst the submissions from the public at large. Thirteen additional entries come from special invitations made by SVT or other entries that SVT has selected from amongst the submissions. Finally, the twenty-eighth entry is selected via the "Svensktoppen Nästa" competition. At least ten percent of the final twenty-eight songs are sung in Swedish. The entire process can begin as early as May of the previous year and is finished by January.

SVT begins looking for songs nine months before the start of the televised Melodifestival (within days of the previous year's Eurovision final). The deadline for submission is in September and songs can be in any language. In the pre-selection, song length is limited to three minutes and twenty seconds; songs must be shortened to three minutes if they reach the final twenty-eight and qualifying songs may also be remixed.

The submission process is overseen by members of the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF), whose task is to reduce the number of songs, which have numbered over 3,000 a year since 2002, to around 1,200. The 3,440 entries received in the preselection for <a href="Sweden%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%202009%23Melodifestivalen%202009">Melodifestivalen 2009</a> is the most in the competition's history. The SMFF's choices are then given to a sixteen-person jury of music professionals, SVT staff and other members of the public. The jury ranges from teenagers to people in their fifties. The songs that qualify, along with their composers and lyricists, are announced at the end of September. This is often followed by fervent speculation over who will perform the songs. Songwriters that qualify must provide interviews to SVT, attend a press conference before the competition, and remain open to promotional appearances if their song reaches the final.

SVT selects performers for the entries. Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists' songs risk disqualification if they refuse. In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola's "När löven faller" in 2003 and <a href="Stephen%20Simmonds">Stephen Simmonds</a>'s "So Good" in 2006. SVT may also give songs to other performers without considering the interests of the demo artist. This prevented the <a href="Brandsta%20City%20Sl%C3%A4ckers">Brandsta City Släckers</a> (in 2004) and <a href="Pernilla%20Wahlgren">Pernilla Wahlgren</a> (in 2005) from performing the songs they had submitted. Replacements for disqualified songs fare unpredictably at the competition. In 2006, "Naughty Boy" by <a href="Hannah%20Graaf">Hannah Graaf</a> (the replacement for Simmonds' song) finished second to last in its semi-final. In 2002 and 2007, by contrast, the replacements performed by <a href="Jan%20Johansen%20%28singer%29">Jan Johansen</a> and <a href="M%C3%A5ns%20Zelmerl%C3%B6w">Måns Zelmerlöw</a> reached the final ten. The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. <a href="Singer-songwriter">Singer-songwriter</a>s are common. As such, artists often confirm that they will participate before the official announcement.

The wildcard ("joker") system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured. Four artists, one in each semi-final, were invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules. The wildcard songs and artists were announced in January. Since the wildcards' introduction, three have won the competition. In 2011 there were 15 wildcards. The wildcard system was discontinued in 2013.

The venues for each year's Melodifestival are announced in September of the preceding year. The semi-finals are held in towns and cities throughout Sweden. The 16,300-capacity <a href="Ericsson%20Globe">Ericsson Globe</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> has hosted the final since the semi-finals were introduced in 2002, through to 2012. In 2013, the final moved to the newly built <a href="Friends%20Arena">Friends Arena</a> in <a href="Solna%20Municipality">Solna Municipality</a>, <a href="Stockholm%20County">Stockholm County</a>. The <a href="Scandinavium">Scandinavium</a> in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a> was offered the 2005 final, but turned it down as it clashed with a <a href="Fr%C3%B6lunda%20HC">Frölunda</a> ice hockey match.

The event spent its early years at one venue: <a href="Cirkus%20%28Stockholm%29">Cirkus</a> in Stockholm, which hosted the first ten competitions. It has hosted the final of Melodifestivalen seventeen times in total. The Stockholm Globe Arena has hosted seven finals, and SVT's headquarters in Stockholm has staged five. The competition first took place outside Stockholm in 1975 as part of a <a href="decentralisation">decentralisation</a> policy at SR. Stockholm has hosted thirty-seven finals in total, including the first fourteen. Gothenburg has hosted eight, and <a href="Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a> seven. The competition's final has never been held outside these cities. Before the 2002 expansion, the host of the previous year's Melodifestival would host the Eurovision Song Contest in the event of a Swedish victory. Hence, the 1985 Eurovision was held in Gothenburg, the 1992 contest in Malmö and the 2000 contest in Stockholm. Since 2002, the only venues that have hosted more than three semi-finals are Gothenburg's Scandinavium, which has hosted one every year since 2003, and Malmö's Malmö Arena. In 2008, Andra Chansen was held in <a href="Kiruna">Kiruna</a>, north of the <a href="Arctic%20Circle">Arctic Circle</a>. Since <a href="Melodifestivalen%202013">2013</a> the final is held at the <a href="Friends%20Arena">Friends Arena</a>.

The televised Melodifestival lasts five weeks and consists of six live shows: four semifinals, in which seven songs compete; a Second Chance round featuring songs which narrowly missed out on qualification from the semifinals; and a grand final. Ten songs comprise the final: two automatic qualifiers from each of the semifinals, and the two most popular songs in the Second Chance round. In 2015, there are seven songs for each semifinal, and twelve (eight winners and four from Andra Chansen) in the final.

Prior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals ("deltävlingar") in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00 <a href="Central%20European%20Time">CET</a> on consecutive Saturday nights. The semi-finals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show.

Unlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round – the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen.
Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semi-final system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004.

The Second Chance round ("Andra chansen") is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semi-final (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semi-final performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semi-final. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semi-finals—such as <a href="Berns%20Salonger">Berns Salonger</a> in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005.

In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full semi-final, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock-out system. The system pairs the eight songs off against each other, then narrows them down to four before pairing them off again. The winners of the two-second round pairings go through to the final. The two finalists do not reprise their songs at the end of the programme.

In 2015, the system was changed again. The eight songs are divided into four duels, with one song from each duel qualifying into the final, bringing the number of finalists to 12.

The final takes place at 20:00 CET on a Saturday in mid-March. Twelve songs (11 songs in <a href="Melodifestivalen%202009">2009</a>, 10 before <a href="Melodifestivalen%202015">2015</a>) participate: two from each semifinal, four from the Second Chance round, and, only in 2009, the international jury's choice. A running order is decided by the competition's supervisors the week before to ensure that similar songs and artists are kept apart in the final. Dress rehearsals for the final are held on the prior Friday, and tickets sell out almost as quickly as those for the final itself. The final attracts much tourism to its host city; a survey in 2006 showed that 54% of spectators had travelled from outside the host city, Stockholm. Of these, 6% had come from outside Sweden.

As at Eurovision, a broadcast of the EBU logo introduces and closes the television coverage, accompanied by the prelude to <a href="Marc-Antoine%20Charpentier">Marc-Antoine Charpentier</a>'s setting of "<a href="Te%20Deum%20%28Charpentier%29">Te Deum</a>". Video "postcards" introduce the entries. The final includes interval performances, which are performed while the juries deliberate and before the televote closes. Former Melodifestivalen contestants have performed as interval acts in the past, including Lena Philipsson in 2005 and the multi-artist medley of former entries in 2000.

The winner receives a trophy, "Den stora Sångfågeln" ("The Great Songbird"), from the previous year's winner. The trophy, designed by <a href="Ernst%20Billgren">Ernst Billgren</a>, was unveiled in 2005 and awarded to all previous Melodifestivalen winners at the "<a href="Alla%20tiders%20Melodifestival">Alla tiders Melodifestival</a>" gala in March of that year. The winner of the competition reprises their song at the end of the event.

Before the introduction of the current voting system in 1999, a group of regional or age-based juries decided the winner of Melodifestivalen. In 1993, televoting was used experimentally, but proved unsuccessful. The Swedish telephone network collapsed due to the number of calls, and claims by the Swedish tabloid press suggested the use of televoting had drastically altered the results. Evening newspapers released what they claimed to be the back-up juries' votes, which showed that the winner, <a href="Arvingarna">Arvingarna</a>'s "<a href="Eloise%20%28Arvingarna%20song%29">Eloise</a>", would have finished fourth had the juries' votes counted. SVT never confirmed the accuracy of these claims.
The current voting format introduced in 1999 is a <a href="positional%20voting%20system">positional voting system</a>, similar to that used at the <a href="Voting%20at%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>. The voting is made up of two segments, in the first of which juries announce their votes; in the second segment the televoting result is announced. The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points (2 x 638 since 2018), which means that televotes and juries have an equal 50/50 weighing in the final result. The juries, usually 11, have represented either Swedish regions or, since 2010, countries participating in the year's Eurovision Song Contest. Until 2017, each jury awarded 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 points to their top seven songs; however, since 2018, the points have been changed to 1 to 7, 8, 10 and 12 points. After the jury voting, the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order. Between 1999 and 2010, the televoting points were fixed; the top seven songs would receive 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 points. Starting in 2011, televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of total vote. If an entry receives 10% of the televotes it will be equivalent to 10% of 473 points, i.e. 48 points (or 638 and 64 points respectively since 2018). The song with the highest number of points at the end of the voting is the winner.

Telephone lines open immediately after the radio preview for the final and do not close until the juries have voted. Two telephone numbers are used for each song, giving voters the option of whether to donate money to SVT's "<a href="Radiohj%C3%A4lpen">Radiohjälpen</a>" charity appeal or not as they vote. Viewers can also vote by <a href="text%20message">text message</a>, and only residents of Sweden can vote.

The votes of the juries are announced by spokespeople who are not members of the juries. The votes are read in ascending order, beginning with one point and finishing with twelve. When read, they are repeated by the host, for example:

Spokesperson: "Ett poäng till melodi nummer två." ("One point to song number two.")
Presenter: Ett poäng till (name song)." ("One point to (name song).")

Since 2012, most spokespeople have announced the points in English, with the hosts repeating them in Swedish.

As the votes are announced, they are collated on a graphic scoreboard. SVT varies the way the jury votes are announced from year to year. For example, the finalists of "" acted as spokespeople in 2004, and in 2006 <a href="Fredrik%20Lindstr%C3%B6m%20%28writer%29">Fredrik Lindström</a> announced jury tallies using the <a href="Swedish%20dialects">dialects</a> of each region. The final of Melodifestivalen has broken Nordic voting records on several occasions; in 2007, voting figures exceeded two million for the first time.

If there is a tie, the song that has received more votes from the public receives the higher position. There have been two ties for first place in the history of the contest. In 1969, <a href="Tommy%20K%C3%B6rberg">Tommy Körberg</a> tied for first place with <a href="Jan%20Malmsj%C3%B6">Jan Malmsjö</a>. The juries them voted for their favourite out the two, leading to <a href="Tommy%20K%C3%B6rberg">Tommy Körberg</a> winning. In 1978, Björn Skifs tied for first place with Lasse Holm and Wizex (performing together); a similar tie-break process resulting in Skifs winning.

Fifty-five of Sweden's fifty-six Eurovision representatives have come from Melodifestivalen. Sweden has won the Eurovision Song Contest six times: in 1974, 1984, 1991, 1999, 2012 and 2015. Sweden has the second highest number of wins for a country at Eurovision; only <a href="Ireland%20in%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Ireland</a> has won the contest more often. The 1974 Eurovision winner, ABBA's "<a href="Waterloo%20%28ABBA%20song%29">Waterloo</a>", was voted the most popular Melodifestivalen song of all time at the "<a href="Alla%20tiders%20Melodifestival">Alla tiders Melodifestival</a>" gala in March 2005. Later that year, it was voted most popular Eurovision song of the contest's first fifty years at <a href="Congratulations%20%28Eurovision%29">a gala</a> in Copenhagen. The following table lists those entries which finished fifth or higher at Eurovision:

Most of Melodifestivalen's rules are dictated by <a href="rules%20of%20the%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">those of the Eurovision Song Contest</a>. However, regulations have been introduced by the Swedish broadcasters. The competition's official rules are released by SVT early in preparation for each year's Melodifestival, to ensure any changes are noted by songwriters and performers.

There was a limit of six people on stage for each performance. This included the Melodifestivalen choir ("huskören", literally "the house choir"), a five-person group of flexible backing singers used by most participants. Artists could use some or all of the back-up singers, or use their own group. All vocals had to be completely live; human voices were not allowed on backing tracks. However, from 2009, the number of performers allowed on stage was eight, and voices were allowed on backing tracks. A live <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a> was used every year from the event's debut to 2000, except 1985 and 1986. Two orchestras were used between 1960 and 1963, a large orchestra and "Göte Wilhelmsons kvartett", a jazz quartet. Since 2001, participants have performed to <a href="backing%20track">backing track</a>s.

Entries cannot be publicly broadcast until the semi-finals are previewed on radio. Entries eliminated in the semi-finals may be broadcast as soon as the semi-final has finished. An embargo is placed on songs that qualify for the later rounds until the previews for the Second Chance are broadcast. After this, restrictions on the broadcast of contestant songs are lifted.

Broadcasters sometimes make sweeping changes to winning songs before they go to Eurovision. For example, at Melodifestivalen 1961, Siw Malmkvist won with "April, April". Performing after her victory, she stumbled on the lyrics of the song and laughed out loud. The press criticised this as childish. SR replaced her with <a href="Lill-Babs">Lill-Babs</a> for the Eurovision Song Contest. The 1987 winner "<a href="Boogaloo%20%28song%29">Fyra bugg och en Coca Cola</a>", performed by <a href="Lotta%20Engberg">Lotta Engberg</a>, is another example; the song's title was changed to "Boogaloo" for Eurovision, as use of a brand name was against the Contest's rules. This name was chosen as Sweden's two previous Eurovision winners had also included the suffix "-loo".

Until 1999, competing songs were only permitted in Swedish, apart from 1965, 1973, 1974, 1975. This did not stop most winning entries recording English (and other language) versions of their songs. Since the abolition of Eurovision's language restrictions in 1999, regardless of the performance language at Melodifestivalen, every Swedish entry has been in English. Spanish, French, <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, <a href="Bosnian%20language">Bosnian</a> and <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> are among the other languages to have featured. <a href="Cameron%20Cartio">Cameron Cartio</a>'s entry in Melodifestivalen 2005 was performed in a <a href="constructed%20language">constructed language</a>.

Melodifestivalen is broadcast on television, radio and the internet. It is broadcast on <a href="SVT1">SVT1</a> with international coverage on <a href="SVT%20World">SVT World</a>. Until 1987, the competition was broadcast on Sveriges Radio TV, later known as TV1. Between 1988 and 2000, the event was broadcast on different channels depending on where it was held. Finals in Stockholm were broadcast on Kanal 1 (formerly TV1) while finals in Gothenburg or Malmö were broadcast on <a href="SVT2">TV2</a>. Sveriges Radio has broadcast the event on <a href="SR%20P1">P1</a>, <a href="SR%20P3">P3</a> and <a href="SR%20P4">P4</a>, where is currently broadcast.

Although the final is traditionally held on a Saturday, in 1990 it was held on a Friday. TV2 suggested this would attract more viewers. In 1991, it was held on <a href="Easter">Easter Sunday</a> for the same reason. The 2002 final was delayed by a week for coverage of the <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a>.

The competition has had an official website since 1999. <a href="Webcast">Webcast</a>s have been provided since 2005. Since 2006, between February and the Eurovision final in May, SR has webcast a radio station dedicated to the competition called "P4 Melodifest". On P4, the public previews semi-finalists every Friday. Broadcast the night after the final, a "dagen efter" ("the day after") television programme acts as an <a href="epilogue">epilogue</a> to the event. It gauges the reactions of the finalists after the competition's climax. No commentary is given for the event on television. <a href="Carolina%20Nor%C3%A9n">Carolina Norén</a> is commentator on the event for <a href="Sveriges%20Radio">Sveriges Radio</a>. The festival has been broadcast in widescreen since 2002 and <a href="Dolby%20Digital">Dolby Digital</a> since 2004.

The competition's viewing figures have been rising since 2002. In 2007, approximately 4.1 million Swedes—almost 44% of the country's population—watched the final, and between 2.9 million and 3.2 million viewers watched each of the semi-finals. The viewing figures for the 2007 festival are nearly two million short of the highest recorded viewing figures from 1990. Melodifestivalen is given heavy coverage in the Swedish press. A study by the Economic Science and Communication Department at <a href="Karlstad%20University">Karlstad University</a> concluded that coverage from the press may have influenced the results of the 2007 festival.

Melodifestivalen's image has evolved throughout its existence, but one word has defined the competition's music: "<a href="schlager">schlager</a>". In Sweden, schlager (a German word literally meaning a "hit") represents any song associated with the competition, from the <a href="jazz%20music">jazz music</a> featured heavily in the 1960s to entries such as <a href="Linda%20Bengtzing">Linda Bengtzing</a>'s in 2006. Christine Demsteader of "<a href="The%20Local">The Local</a>" described Swedish schlager as "typically characterized by an annoyingly repetitive melody and trivial lyrics of little or no meaning".

Jazz artists such as <a href="Monica%20Zetterlund">Monica Zetterlund</a> and <a href="%C3%96sten%20Warnerbring">Östen Warnerbring</a> won the event in the 1960s. <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a>, who won Eurovision in 1974, went on to be Sweden's most successful music export. The group influenced not only Melodifestivalen, but the entire Swedish mainstream music scene. In the 1980s, <a href="Bert%20Karlsson">Bert Karlsson</a>'s <a href="Mariann%20Grammofon">Mariann Grammofon</a> record label was responsible for the prevalence of "easy, memorable tunes". The early twenty-first century has seen more variety in the competition, such as <a href="Afro-dite">Afro-dite</a>'s 2002 disco winner and The Ark's 2007 "retro glam rock" effort.

On-stage <a href="gimmick">gimmick</a>s have long been a part of performances at the competition. <a href="Lena%20Philipsson">Lena Philipsson</a>'s use of a microphone stand in her performance of "<a href="Det%20g%C3%B6r%20ont">Det gör ont</a>" at the 2004 competition is an example. When Philipsson hosted Melodifestivalen in 2006, four tongue-in-cheek short films were broadcast during the semi-finals to show what had happened to the microphone stand in the years since her win. <a href="Pyrotechnics">Pyrotechnics</a> are another common gimmick in Melodifestivalen performances. After the 2007 event, Karolina Lassbo of "Dagens Media" criticised the festival's musical content and production, arguing that the 1988 competition was "the time when Melodifestivalen was still a schlager competition" and the event had become "a cross between [reality series] "Fame Factory" and [inter-city game show] "Stadskampen"".

St Cuthbert Gospel

The St Cuthbert Gospel, also known as the Stonyhurst Gospel or the St Cuthbert Gospel of St John, is an early 8th-century pocket <a href="gospel%20book">gospel book</a>, written in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. Its finely decorated leather binding is the earliest known Western <a href="bookbinding">bookbinding</a> to survive, and both the 94 <a href="vellum">vellum</a> <a href="recto%20and%20verso">folios</a> and the binding are in outstanding condition for a book of this age. With a page size of only , the St Cuthbert Gospel is one of the smallest surviving Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. The essentially undecorated text is the <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a> in Latin, written in a script that has been regarded as a model of elegant simplicity.

The book takes its name from <a href="Cuthbert%20of%20Lindisfarne">Saint Cuthbert</a> of <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a>, <a href="North%20East%20England">North East England</a>, in whose tomb it was placed, probably a few years after his death in 687. Although it was long regarded as Cuthbert's personal copy of the Gospel, to which there are early references, and so a <a href="relic">relic</a> of the saint, the book is now thought to date from shortly after Cuthbert's death. It was probably a gift from <a href="Monkwearmouth%E2%80%93Jarrow%20Abbey">Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey</a>, where it was written, intended to be placed in <a href="St%20Cuthbert%27s%20coffin">St Cuthbert's coffin</a> in the few decades after this was placed behind the altar at Lindisfarne in 698. It presumably remained in the coffin through its long travels after 875, forced by Viking invasions, ending at <a href="Durham%20Cathedral">Durham Cathedral</a>. The book was found inside the coffin and removed in 1104 when the burial was once again moved within the cathedral. It was kept there with other relics, and important visitors were able to wear the book in a leather bag around their necks. It is thought that after the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> in England by <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> between 1536 and 1541, the book passed to collectors. It was eventually given to <a href="Stonyhurst%20College">Stonyhurst College</a>, the <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> school in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>.

From 1979 it was on long-term loan from the British province of the Jesuit order to the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>, catalogued as Loan 74. On 14 July 2011 the British Library launched a fundraising campaign to buy the book for £9 million, and on 17 April 2012 announced that the purchase had been completed and the book was now British Library <a href="British%20Library%23Additional%20manuscripts">Additional MS</a> 89000.

The library plans to display the Gospel for equal amounts of time in London and <a href="Durham%2C%20England">Durham</a>. It describes the manuscript as "the earliest surviving intact European book and one of the world's most significant books". The Cuthbert Gospel returned to Durham to feature in exhibitions in 2013 and 2014. In 2017 it was "resting" off display, but it will be in British Library's Anglo-Saxon exhibition in autumn 2018. A new book on the gospel was published in 2015, incorporating the results of research since the purchase; among other things this pushed the likely date from the late 7th to the early 8th century, perhaps as late as 730.

The St Cuthbert Gospel is a pocket-sized book, 138 by 92 millimetres (5.4 × 3.6 in), of the <a href="Gospel%20of%20St%20John">Gospel of St John</a> written in <a href="uncial%20script">uncial script</a> on 94 vellum folios. It is bound in wooden cover boards, covered with tooled red leather.

The St Cuthbert Gospel is significant both intrinsically as the earliest surviving European book complete with its original binding and by association with the 7th-century Anglo-Saxon saint <a href="Cuthbert%20of%20Lindisfarne">Cuthbert of Lindisfarne</a>. A miniature in the <a href="Codex%20Amiatinus">Codex Amiatinus</a>, of the Prophet <a href="Ezra">Ezra</a> writing in his library, shows several books similarly bound in red decorated with geometric designs. This miniature was probably based on an original in the <a href="Codex%20Grandior">Codex Grandior</a>, a lost imported Italian Bible at <a href="Jarrow">Jarrow</a>, which showed <a href="Cassiodorus">Cassiodorus</a> and the nine volumes he wrote of commentary on the Bible. Whether the bindings depicted, which were presumably of leather, included raised elements cannot be detected, but the books are stored singly flat in a cupboard, which would reduce the wear on any raised patterns.

Early medieval <a href="treasure%20binding">treasure binding</a>s with a structure in precious metal, and often containing gems, <a href="ivory%20carving">carved ivory</a> panels or metal reliefs, are perhaps better known today than leather bindings, but these were for books used in church services or as "book-icons" rather than for use in libraries. Of treasure bindings from this period, only the lower cover of the <a href="Lindau%20Gospels">Lindau Gospels</a> (750–800, <a href="Morgan%20Library">Morgan Library</a>) now survives complete, though there are several references to them, most famously to that of the <a href="Book%20of%20Kells">Book of Kells</a>, which was lost after a theft in 1007. Various metal fragments of what were probably book-mounts have survived, usually adapted as jewellery by <a href="Vikings">Vikings</a>. In the context of the <a href="cult%20%28religious%20practice%29">cult</a> of Cuthbert, the lavishly illuminated <a href="Lindisfarne%20Gospels">Lindisfarne Gospels</a> were made at Lindisfarne, probably shortly after the St Cuthbert Gospel, with covers involving metalwork, perhaps entirely made in it, which are also now lost. Plainer, very early bindings in leather are almost as rare as treasure bindings, as the bindings of books in libraries usually wore out and needed to be renewed, and earlier collectors did not consider most historical bindings worth retaining.

The text is a very good and careful copy of the single Gospel of John from what has been called the "Italo-Northumbrian" family of texts, other well-known examples of which are several manuscripts from Wearmouth–Jarrow, including the <a href="Codex%20Amiatinus">Codex Amiatinus</a>, and in the British Library the <a href="Lindisfarne%20Gospels">Lindisfarne Gospels</a> and <a href="Gospel%20Book%20%28British%20Library%2C%20MS%20Royal%201.%20B.%20VII%29">the Gospel Book MS Royal 1. B. VII</a>. This family is presumed to have derived from a hypothetical "Neapolitan Gospelbook" brought to England by <a href="Adrian%20of%20Canterbury">Adrian of Canterbury</a>, a companion of <a href="Theodore%20of%20Tarsus">Theodore of Tarsus</a> who <a href="Bede">Bede</a> says had been abbot of <a href="Nisida">Nisida</a>, an equally hypothetical monastery near <a href="Naples">Naples</a>. In the <a href="rubric">rubric</a>s of the Lindisfarne Gospels are several that are "specifically Neapolitan", including festivals which were celebrated only in Naples such as The Nativity of St. <a href="Januarius">Januarius</a> and the Dedication of the Basilica of Stephen. The Neapolitan manuscript was probably at Wearmouth–Jarrow.

Apart from enlarged and sometimes slightly elaborated initials opening the <a href="Eusebian%20Canons">Ammonian Sections</a> (the contemporary equivalent of the modern division into verses), and others in red at the start of chapters, the text has no <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illumination</a> or decoration, but Sir <a href="David%20M.%20Wilson">David Wilson</a>, historian of <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20art">Anglo-Saxon art</a> and <a href="Director%20of%20the%20British%20Museum">Director of the British Museum</a>, used it as his example in writing "some manuscripts are so beautifully written that illumination would seem only to spoil them". Julian Brown wrote that "the capitular uncial of the Stonyhurst Gospel owes its beauty to simple design and perfect execution. The decorative elements in the script never interfere with the basic structure of the letter-forms; they arise naturally from the slanted angle at which the pen was held".

The pages with the text have been ruled with a blind <a href="stylus">stylus</a> or similar tool, leaving just an impression in the vellum. It can be shown that this was done for each gathering with just two sets of lines, ruled on the outermost and innermost pages, requiring a very firm impression to carry the marks through to the sheets behind. Impressed lines mark the vertical edges of the text area, and there is an outer pair of lines. Each line of text is ruled, only as far as the inner vertical lines, and there are prick marks where the horizontal lines meet the verticals. The book begins with 19 lines on a page, but at <a href="recto%20and%20verso">folio</a> 42 changes to 20 lines per page, requiring the re-ruling of some pages. This change was evidently a departure from the original plan, and may have been caused by a shortage of the very fine vellum, as two different sorts are used, though the change does not coincide exactly with the change in the number of lines.

Four passages are marked in the <a href="margin%20%28typography%29">margin</a>, which correspond to those used as readings in <a href="Requiem">Masses for the Dead</a> in the Roman <a href="lectionary">lectionary</a> of the mid-7th century. This seems to have been done hastily, as most left offset marks on the opposite pages from the book being closed before the ink was dry. This seems to indicate that the book was used at least once as the gospel book for a Mass for the Dead, perhaps on the occasion of Cuthbert's elevation in 698. In the example illustrated at left, the start of the reading at line 10 is marked with a cross, and "de mortuorum" ("for the dead") written beside. The reading ends on the next page, which is also marked.

The original tooled red <a href="goatskin%20%28material%29">goatskin</a> <a href="bookbinding">binding</a> is the earliest surviving intact Western binding, and the virtually unique survivor of decorated <a href="Insular%20art">Insular</a> leatherwork. The decoration of the front cover includes colour, and the main motif is raised, which is unique among the few surviving Early Medieval bindings. The panels of geometrical decoration with two-stranded <a href="interlace%20%28visual%20arts%29">interlace</a> closely relate to Insular <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s, and can be compared to the <a href="carpet%20page">carpet page</a>s found in these. Elements of the design also relate to Anglo-Saxon metalwork in the case of the general origin of interlace in manuscripts, and <a href="Coptic%20art">Coptic</a> and other East Mediterranean designs.

The decoration of the covers includes three pigments filling lines engraved with a sharp pointed instrument, which now appear as two shades of yellow, one bright and the other pale, and a dark colour that now appears as blue-grey, but was recorded as blue in the earliest descriptions. The front cover includes all three colours, but the pale yellow is not used on the back cover. The pigments have been analysed for the first time, as one benefit of the purchase of the manuscript by the British Library, and identified by <a href="Raman%20spectroscopy">Raman spectroscopy</a> as <a href="orpiment">orpiment</a> (yellow) and <a href="indigo">indigo</a> (grey-blue). The balance of the designs on both covers is now affected by what appears to be the greater fading of the dark blue-grey pigment. The bookbinder <a href="Roger%20Powell%20%28bookbinder%29">Roger Powell</a> speculated that the "pale lemon-yellow ... may once have been green", giving an original colour scheme of blue, green and yellow on the red background, although the recent testing suggests this was not the case.

Given the lack of surviving objects, we cannot know how common the techniques employed were, but the quality of the execution suggests that the binder was experienced in them. At the same time, an analysis by Robert Stevick suggests that the designs for both covers were intended to follow a sophisticated geometric scheme of <a href="compass%20and%20straightedge%20constructions">compass and straightedge constructions</a> using the "two true measures of geometry", the ratio between <a href="Pythagoras%27%20constant">Pythagoras' constant</a> and one, and the <a href="golden%20section">golden section</a>. However slips in the complicated process of production, some detailed below, mean that the finished covers do not quite exhibit the intended proportions, and are both slightly out of true in some respects.

Although it seems clear from the style of the script that the text was written at Monkwearmouth–Jarrow, it is possible that the binding was then added at Lindisfarne; the form of the plant scrolls can be compared to those on the portable altar also found in Cuthbert's coffin, presumed to have been made there, though also to other works of the period, such as the shaft of an Anglo-Saxon cross from <a href="Penrith%2C%20Cumbria">Penrith</a> and the <a href="Vespasian%20Psalter">Vespasian Psalter</a>. Small holes in the folds of each gathering seem to represent a "temporary sewing" together of the pages, one explanation of which is a journey made by the unbound pages.

The decoration of the front cover is divided into fields bordered by raised lines. The central field contains a plant motif representing a stylised <a href="chalice">chalice</a> in the centre with a bud and scrolling <a href="vine">vine</a> stems leading from it, fruit and several small leaves. Above and below the central motif are fields containing interlace ornament in finely incised lines. The three motifs are enclosed within a border containing further interlacing.

Continuous vine <a href="scrollwork">scrolls</a> in a great variety of designs of the same general type as the central motif, with few leaves and round fruits, were very common in slightly later religious <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20art">Anglo-Saxon art</a>, and are often combined with interlace in the same work, especially on <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20cross">Anglo-Saxon cross</a>es, for example the <a href="Bewcastle%20Cross">Bewcastle Cross</a> and the <a href="Easby%20Cross">Easby Cross</a> now in the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>. One face of the fragmentary silver cover of the <a href="portable%20altar">portable altar</a> also recovered from Cuthbert's coffin has a similar combination of elements, with both areas of interlace and, in the four corners, a simple plant motif with a central bud or leaf and a spiral shoot on either side. The combination of different types of ornament within a panelled framework is highly typical of Northumbrian art, above all the <a href="Lindisfarne%20Gospels">Lindisfarne Gospels</a>. Interlace may well have still been believed to have some quasi-magical protective power, which seems to have been its function in pre-Christian Germanic art. The vine motif here differs from the common continuous scroll type in that the stems cross over each other twice on each side, but crossing stems are also seen on the upper north face of the Bewcastle Cross and a cross in the church at <a href="Hexham">Hexham</a>. <a href="Meyer%20Schapiro">Meyer Schapiro</a> compares the motif with one in an initial in the later <a href="Book%20of%20Kells">Book of Kells</a>. It was suggested by Berthe van Regemorter that in the St Cuthbert Gospel this design represents Christ (as the central bud) and the <a href="Four%20Evangelists">Four Evangelists</a> as the grapes, following , "I am the vine, ye are the branches", but this idea has been treated with caution by other scholars.

The two panels of interlace use the same design, of what David H. Wright describes as the "alternating pair thin-line type" which he calls "perhaps the most sophisticated of Insular interlace types". The panels are symmetrical about a vertical axis, except for the left end of the upper panel, which is different. Whereas the other ends of the pattern finish in a flat line parallel with the vertical framing line, part of a shape like an incomplete D, the top left finishes in two ellipses pointing into the corners. The lines forming the interlace patterns are coloured in the dark blue/black and the bright yellow, but differently. In the lower panel the yellow colours the left half of the design, but the upper panel begins at the (deviant) left in the dark colour, then switches to yellow once the pattern changes to that used for the rest of the panels. It continues in yellow until the central point, then changes to the dark colour for the right hand side of the design.

The transition between the top left, perhaps where the artist began, and the standard pattern, is somewhat awkward, leaving a rather bald spot (for an interlace pattern) to the left of the first curving yellow vertical. The change in pattern pushes the halfway point of the upper panel rather off-centre to the right, whereas in the lower panel it falls slightly to the left of dead centre. These vagaries in the design suggest that it was done freehand, without marking-out the pattern using compasses for example. The lowest horizontal raised line is not straight, being higher at the left, probably because of an error in the marking or drilling of the holes in the cover board through which the ends of the cord run. The simple twist or chain border in yellow between the two raised frames resembles an element in an initial in the <a href="Gospel%20Book%20Fragment%20%28Durham%20Cathedral%20Library%2C%20A.%20II.%2010.%29">Durham Gospel Book Fragment</a>, an important earlier manuscript from Lindisfarne.

The back cover is decorated more simply, with no raised elements and purely geometric decoration of engraved lines, which are filled in with two pigments which now appear as the bright yellow and the dark colour, once apparently blue. Within several framing lines making rectangles of similar proportions to the cover itself, a central rectangular panel is marked with pricks to make a grid of 3mm squares, 21 tall and 10 wide. Lines on the grid are engraved and coloured in yellow to form two stepped "crosses", or squares standing on one corner, with additional stepped elements in the four corners and halfway up the vertical sides, between the two "crosses". The vertical <a href="reflection%20symmetry">axial</a> line down the grid and the two horizontal axes through the crosses are also coloured in the yellow pigment right to the edges of the grid. The remaining lines on the grid and all the lines along the edges of the grid are coloured in the dark colour. This is a simple version of the sort of design found on Insular carpet pages, as well as in Coptic manuscript decoration and textiles, and small stepped crosses decorate the main panels of the famous <a href="Sutton%20Hoo">Sutton Hoo</a> shoulder-clasps. The alignment of the various outer framing lines with the innermost frame and the panel with the grid is noticeably imperfect, as the top framing line was extended too far to the left. Traces of an uncoloured first attempt at this line can be seen on the right hand side, above the coloured line.

Although the binding had never been taken apart for examination before it was bought by the British Library, a considerable amount can be said about its construction. A combination of looseness through wear and tear, damage in certain places, and the failure of the paste that glued the pages to the inside of the covers, now allow non-intrusive inspection of much of the binding construction, including the rear of the actual wooden front cover board, and some of the holes made through it.

The raised framing lines can be seen from the rear of the front cover to have been produced by gluing cord to the board and tooling the leather over it, in a technique of <a href="Coptic%20binding">Coptic</a> origin, of which few early examples survive – one of the closest is a 9th- or 10th-century Islamic binding found in the <a href="Mosque%20of%20Uqba">Mosque of Uqba</a> in <a href="Kairouan">Kairouan</a>, <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>. There are holes in the board in which the cut-off ends can be seen from behind.

The chalice and plant motif on the front, of which there is no trace from behind, has been built up using some clay-like material underneath the leather, as shown by <a href="CT-scan">CT-scan</a>s since the purchase. In the 2015 book, Nicholas Pickwoad suggests that this raised decoration was formed using a matrix which was pressed into the damp leather over the clay-like substance and the wooden board. Previous authors had suggested that the material under the relief decoration might have been built up in <a href="gesso">gesso</a> as well as cord and leather scraps before applying the cover leather. A broadly similar plant motif in similar technique is found on a later Middle Eastern pouch in the <a href="Walters%20Art%20Museum">Walters Art Museum</a> in Baltimore.
The boards of the covers, previously assumed to be <a href="limewood">limewood</a>, are now thought to be <a href="birch">birch</a>, an unusual wood in later bindings, but one easily available in northern England. Both have four holes where the binding threads were laced through; the two threads were run round the inner edges of the cover and knotted back at the holes. The front cover has an additional 12 holes where the ends of the cords for the raised framing lines went through, at the four corners of the two main frames, and the ends of the horizontal bars between the interlace panels and the central vine motif.

The stitching of the binding uses "<a href="Coptic%20sewing">Coptic sewing</a>", that is "flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round one another in a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)" Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords. Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from <a href="Copts">Coptic</a> libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish <a href="Insular%20art%23Other%20books">pocket gospel book</a> from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at <a href="Fulda">Fulda</a>, which is believed to have belonged to Saint <a href="Boniface">Boniface</a>. This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique. The first appearance of the cords or supports that these "unsupported" bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques. The cords run horizontally across the spine, and are thicker than the threads that hold the pages together. They are attached, typically by lacing through holes or glue, to the two boards of the cover, and the threads holding the gatherings are knotted to them, resulting in a stronger binding.

The manuscript itself carries no date but a rather precise dating has been given to it, based mainly on its <a href="palaeography">palaeography</a> or handwriting, and also the known facts of Cuthbert's burial. The dating was revised after the acquisition by the British Library, who added to their online catalogue entry:

Previously dated to the end of the 7th century (The Stonyhurst Gospel, ed. T. J. Brown (1969), pp. 12–13), R. Gameson dates the script to c. 710–c. 730 and <a href="Leslie%20Webster%20%28art%20historian%29">L. Webster</a> dates the decoration on the covers to c. 700–c. 730 (The St Cuthbert Gospel, eds C. Breay and B. Meehan (2015), pp. 33, 80).

The script is the "capitular" form of <a href="uncial">uncial</a>, with just a few emphasized letters at the start of sections in "text" uncial. Close analysis of the changing style of details of the forms of letters allows the manuscript to be placed with some confidence within a chronological sequence of the few other manuscripts thought to have been produced at Wearmouth-Jarrow. The Northumbrian scribes "imitate very closely the best Italian manuscripts of about the sixth century", but introduced small elements that gave their script a distinct style, which has always been greatly admired. However, there were several scribes, seven different ones working on the Codex Amiatinus, whose scripts may not all have developed at the same pace.

Key to this sequence is the <a href="Codex%20Amiatinus">Codex Amiatinus</a>, an almost complete Bible for which we have a very precise "<a href="terminus%20ante%20quem">terminus ante quem</a>", and within which, because of its size, developments in style can be seen in a single manuscript. The Codex Amiatinus can be precisely located as leaving Wearmouth-Jarrow with a party led by Abbot <a href="Ceolfrith">Ceolfrith</a> on 4 June 716, bound for Rome. The codex was to be presented to <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20II">Pope Gregory II</a>, a decision only announced by Ceolfrith very shortly before the departure, allowing the dedication page to be dated with confidence to around May 716, though the rest of the manuscript was probably already some years old, but only begun after Ceolfrith succeeded as abbot in 689. The script of the dedication page differs slightly from that of the main text, but is by the same hand and in the same "elaborated text uncial" style as some pages at Durham (MS A II 17, part ii, ff 103-11). At the end of the sequence, it may be possible to date the <a href="Saint%20Petersburg%20Bede">Saint Petersburg Bede</a> to 746 at the earliest, from references in "memoranda" in the text, although this remains a matter of controversy.

There survive parts of a gospel book, by coincidence now bound up with the famous <a href="Utrecht%20Psalter">Utrecht Psalter</a>, which are identifiable as by the same scribe as the Cuthbert Gospel, and where "the capitular uncial of the two manuscripts is indistinguishable in style or quality, so they may well be very close to each other in date". Since the Utrecht pages also use <a href="Rustic%20capital">Rustic capital</a> script, which the Cuthbert Gospel does not, it allows another basis for comparison with further manuscripts in the sequence.

From the palaeographical evidence, T. Julian Brown concluded that the Cuthbert manuscript was written after the main text of the Codex Amiatinus, which was finished after 688, perhaps by 695, though it might be later. Turning to the historical evidence for Cuthbert's burial, this placed it after his original burial in 687 but possibly before his elevation to the high altar in 698. If this is correct, the book was never a personal possession of Cuthbert, as has sometimes been thought, but was possibly created specifically to be placed in his coffin, whether for the occasion of his elevation in 698 or at another date. The less precise hints about dating that can be derived from the style of the binding compared to other works did not conflict with these conclusions, though in the new 2015 study, <a href="Leslie%20Webster%20%28art%20historian%29">Leslie Webster</a> now dates the cover to "c. 700–c. 730", and Richard Gameson "dates the script to c. 710–c. 730", as quoted above.

Cuthbert was an <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a>, perhaps of a noble family, born in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">Kingdom of Northumbria</a> in the mid-630s, some ten years after the conversion of <a href="Edwin%20of%20Northumbria">King Edwin</a> to Christianity in 627, which was slowly followed by that of the rest of his people. The politics of the kingdom were violent, and there were later episodes of pagan rule, while <a href="Christianisation%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">spreading understanding of Christianity</a> through the kingdom was a task that lasted throughout Cuthbert's lifetime. Edwin had been baptised by <a href="Paulinus%20of%20York">Paulinus of York</a>, an Italian who had come with the <a href="Gregorian%20mission">Gregorian mission</a> from Rome, but his successor <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald</a> also invited Irish monks from <a href="Iona">Iona</a> to found the monastery at Lindisfarne where Cuthbert was to spend much of his life. This was around 635, about the time Cuthbert was born.

The tension between the Roman and <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">Irish traditions</a>, often exacerbated by Cuthbert's near-contemporary Saint <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a>, an intransigent and quarrelsome supporter of Roman ways, was to be a major feature of Cuthbert's lifetime. Cuthbert himself, though educated in the Irish tradition, followed his mentor <a href="Eata%20of%20Hexham">Eata</a> in accepting the Roman forms without apparent difficulty after the <a href="Synod%20of%20Whitby">Synod of Whitby</a> in 664. The earliest biographies concentrate on the many <a href="Miracle%23Catholic%20Church">miracles</a> that accompanied even his early life, but he was evidently indefatigable as a travelling priest spreading the Christian message to remote villages, and also well able to impress royalty and nobility. Unlike Wilfrid, his style of life was austere, and when he was able he lived the life of a <a href="hermit">hermit</a>, though still receiving many visitors.

He grew up near the new <a href="Old%20Melrose">Melrose Abbey</a>, an offshoot from <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a> which is today in Scotland, but was then in Northumbria. He had decided to become a monk after seeing a vision on the night in 651 that St <a href="Aidan%20of%20Lindisfarne">Aidan</a>, the founder of Lindisfarne, died, but seems to have seen some military service first. He was quickly made guest-master at the new monastery at <a href="Ripon">Ripon</a>, soon after 655, but had to return with Eata to Melrose when Wilfrid was given the monastery instead. About 662 he was made prior at Melrose, and around 665 went as prior to Lindisfarne. In 684 he was made <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lindisfarne">Bishop of Lindisfarne</a>, but by late 686 he resigned and returned to his hermitage as he felt he was about to die, although he was probably still only in his early 50s. After a few weeks of illness he died on the island on 20 March 687, and his body was carried back to Lindisfarne and buried there the same day.

Although first documented in 1104, the book is presumed to have been buried with Cuthbert at <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a>, and to have stayed with the body during the wanderings forced by the <a href="Viking%20invasions">Viking invasions</a> two centuries later. <a href="Bede">Bede</a>'s "Life" recounts that Cuthbert was initially buried in a stone <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> to the right of the altar in the church at Lindisfarne; he had wanted to be buried at the hermitage on <a href="Farne%20Islands">Inner Farne Island</a> where he died, but before his death was persuaded to allow his burial at the main monastery. His burial was first disturbed eleven years after his death, when his remains were moved to behind the altar to reflect his recognition, in the days before a formal process of <a href="canonization">canonisation</a>, as a saint. The sarcophagus was opened and his body was said to have been found perfectly preserved or <a href="incorruptibility">incorrupt</a>. This apparent miracle led to the steady growth of Cuthbert's posthumous cult, to the point where he became the most popular saint of Northern England.

Numerous miracles were attributed to his intercession and to intercessory <a href="prayer">prayer</a> near his remains. In particular, <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>, <a href="King%20of%20Wessex">King of Wessex</a>, was inspired and encouraged in his struggle against the Danes by a vision or dream he had of Cuthbert. Thereafter, the royal <a href="house%20of%20Wessex">house of Wessex</a>, who became the kings of England, made a point of devotion to Cuthbert, which also had a useful political message, as they came from opposite ends of the united English kingdom. Cuthbert was "a figure of reconciliation and a rallying point for the reformed identity of Northumbria and England" after the absorption of the <a href="Danelaw">Danish populations</a> into Anglo-Saxon society, according to <a href="Michelle%20P.%20Brown">Michelle Brown</a>. The 8th-century historian Bede wrote both a verse and a prose life of St Cuthbert around 720. He has been described as "perhaps the most popular saint in England prior to the death of <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a> in 1170." In 698, Cuthbert was reburied in the decorated oak coffin now usually meant by <a href="St%20Cuthbert%27s%20coffin">St Cuthbert's coffin</a>, though he was to have many more coffins. The book was believed to have been produced for this occasion and perhaps placed in his coffin at this time, but according to the new dating it was only created up to 30 years after 698.

In 793 Lindisfarne was devastated by the first serious , but Cuthbert's shrine seems to have escaped damage. In 875 the Danish leader <a href="Halfdene">Halfdene</a> (Halfdan Ragnarsson), who shared with his brother <a href="Ivar%20the%20Boneless">Ivar the Boneless</a> the leadership of the <a href="Great%20Heathen%20Army">Great Heathen Army</a> that had conquered much of the south of England, moved north to spend the winter there, as a prelude to settlement and further conquest. <a href="Eardulf%20of%20Lindisfarne">Eardulf</a>, the Bishop of Lindisfarne, decided the monastery must be abandoned, and orderly preparations were made for the whole community, including lay people and children, to evacuate.

It was possibly at this point that a shelf or inner cover was inserted some way under the lid of Cuthbert's coffin, supported on three wooden bars across the width, and probably with two iron rings fixed to it for lifting it off. Eardulf had decided to take the most important remains and possessions of the community with them, and whether new or old, the shelf in Cuthbert's coffin was probably loaded with the St Cuthbert Gospel, which was found there in 1104. It may also have held the <a href="Lindisfarne%20Gospels">Lindisfarne Gospels</a>, now also in the British Library, and other books from Lindisfarne that were, and in several cases still are, at Durham Cathedral. Other bones taken by the party were those remains of St <a href="Aidan%20of%20Lindisfarne">Aidan</a> (d. 651), the founder of the community, that had not been sent to Melrose, and the head of the king and saint <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald of Northumbria</a>, who had converted the kingdom and encouraged the founding of Lindisfarne. These and other relics were reverently packaged in cloth and labelled, as more recent relics are. The community also took a stone Anglo-Saxon cross, and although they had a "vehiculum" of some sort, probably a cart or simple wagon, Cuthbert's coffin was carried by seven young men who had grown up in the community.

They set off inland and spent the first months at an unknown location in west <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, near the <a href="River%20Derwent%2C%20Cumbria">River Derwent</a>, probably in the modern <a href="Lake%20District">Lake District</a>, and according to <a href="Symeon%20of%20Durham">Symeon of Durham</a>'s "<a href="Libellus%20de%20exordio">Libellus de exordio</a>", the main source for this period, Eardulf tried to hire a ship on the west coast to take them to Ireland. Then they left the more remote west side of the country and returned to the east, finding a resting-place at <a href="Craike">Craike</a> near <a href="Easingwold">Easingwold</a>, close to the coast, well south of Lindisfarne, but also sufficiently far north of the <a href="Scandinavian%20York">new Viking kingdom being established at York</a>.

Over the next century the Vikings of York and the north became gradually Christianized, and Cuthbert's shrine became a focus of devotion among them also. The community established close relations with <a href="Guthred">Guthred</a> (d. 895), Halfdene's successor as king, and received land from him at <a href="Chester-le-Street">Chester-le-Street</a>. In 883 they moved the few miles there, where they stayed over a century, building <a href="St%20Mary%20and%20St%20Cuthbert%2C%20Chester-le-Street">St Cuthbert's Church</a>, where Cuthbert's shrine was placed. In 995 a new Danish invasion led the community to flee some 50 miles south to Ripon, again taking the coffin with them. After three or four months it was felt safe to return, and the party had nearly reached Chester-le-Street when their wagon became definitively stuck close to <a href="Durham%2C%20England">Durham</a>, then a place with cultivated fields, but hardly a settlement, perhaps just an isolated farm. It was thought that Cuthbert was expressing a wish to settle where he was, and the community obeyed. A new stone church—the so-called White Church—was built, the predecessor of the present Durham Cathedral.

In 1104, early in the bishopric of <a href="Ranulf%20Flambard">Ranulf Flambard</a>, Cuthbert's tomb was opened again and his relics translated to a new <a href="shrine">shrine</a> behind the main <a href="altar">altar</a> of the half-built Norman cathedral. According to the earlier of the two accounts of the event that survive, known as "Miracles 18–20" or the "anonymous account", written by a monk of the cathedral, when the monks opened the decorated inner coffin, which was for the first time in living memory, they saw "a book of the Gospels lying at the head of the board", that is on the shelf or inner lid. The account in "Miracle 20" adds that Bishop Flambard, during his sermon on the day the new shrine received Cuthbert's body, showed the congregation "a Gospel of Saint John in miraculously perfect condition, which had a satchel-like container of red leather with a badly frayed sling made of silken threads". In addition the book itself has an inscription on folio 1r "written in a modest <a href="book-hand">book-hand</a> apparently of the later twelfth century" recording that it was found in the translation.

As far as is known the book remained at Durham for the remainder of the Middle Ages, until the Dissolution, kept as a <a href="relic">relic</a> in three bags of red leather, normally resting in a <a href="reliquary">reliquary</a>, and there are various records of it being shown to visitors, the more distinguished of which were allowed to hang it round their neck for a while. According to <a href="Reginald%20of%20Durham">Reginald of Durham</a> (d. c 1190) "anyone approaching it should wash, fast and dress in an <a href="alb">alb</a> before touching it", and he recorded that a scribe called John who failed to do this during a visit by <a href="William%20of%20York">the Archbishop of York</a> in 1153–54, and "held it with unwashed hands after eating was struck down with a chill". Books treated as relics are especially characteristic of <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">Celtic Christianity</a>; several of the surviving Irish <a href="cumdach">book-shrines</a> were worn in this way.

Another recorded copy of the Gospel of John has also been associated with Cuthbert, and sometimes thought to be the St Cuthbert Gospel. Saint <a href="Boisil">Boisil</a> (d. 664) of Melrose Abbey was Cuthbert's teacher. Bede's prose life of Cuthbert records that during Boisil's last illness, he and Cuthbert read daily one of the seven <a href="gathering%20%28bookbinding%29">gatherings or quaternion</a>s of Boisil's manuscript of the Gospel of John. The sermon in "Miracle 20" identifies this manuscript with the one at Durham, and says that both saints had worn it round their necks, ignoring that it has twelve gatherings rather than seven. There are further references from Durham to Boisil's book, such as a list of relics in the cathedral in 1389, and some modern scholars were attracted to the idea that they were the same, but Brown's palaeographical evidence seems to remove the possibility of Boisil's book being the St Cuthbert Gospel. In the 11th century Boisil's remains had also been brought to Durham, and enshrined next to those of Cuthbert. Around the same time Bede's own remains were stolen from Monkwearmouth–Jarrow for Durham, by a "notably underhand trick", and placed in Cuthbert's coffin, where they remained until 1104.

It is thought likely that the book remained at Durham until the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> under Henry VIII, although the various late medieval records of books and relics held there do not allow it to be identified with certainty. Durham Cathedral Priory closed in 1540, and some decades later the book was recorded by <a href="James%20Ussher">Archbishop Ussher</a> in the library of the Oxford scholar, antiquary and <a href="astrologer">astrologer</a> <a href="Thomas%20Allen%20%28mathematician%29">Thomas Allen</a> (1542–1632) of <a href="Gloucester%20Hall">Gloucester Hall</a> (now <a href="Worcester%20College%2C%20Oxford">Worcester College, Oxford</a>). However it is not in a catalogue of Allen's library of 1622, and was not in the collection of Allen's manuscripts that was presented to the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a> by <a href="Sir%20Kenelm%20Digby">Sir Kenelm Digby</a> in 1634. Nothing is then known of its whereabouts for a century or so.

According to an 18th-century Latin inscription pasted to the inside cover of the manuscript, the St Cuthbert Gospel was given by the <a href="George%20Lee%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Lichfield">3rd Earl of Lichfield</a> (1718–1772) to the Jesuit priest Thomas Phillips S.J. (1708–1774) who donated it to the <a href="Colleges%20of%20St%20Omer%2C%20Bruges%20and%20Li%C3%A8ge">English Jesuit College</a> at <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a> on 20 June 1769. Lichfield was an Anglican, but knew Phillips as the latter was chaplain to his neighbour in <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>, the <a href="recusant">recusant</a> George Talbot, 14th <a href="Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">Earl of Shrewsbury</a> (1719–1787). The manuscript was owned between 1769 and 2012 by the British Province of the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a>, and for most of this period was in the library of <a href="Stonyhurst%20College">Stonyhurst College</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, successor to the Liège college.

The manuscript was first published when in 1806 it was taken to London and displayed when a letter on it by the Rev. J. Milner, presumably <a href="John%20Milner%20%28bishop%29">Bishop John Milner</a>, Catholic <a href="Vicar%20Apostolic%20of%20the%20Midland%20District">Vicar Apostolic of the Midland District</a>, was read to a meeting of the <a href="London%20Society%20of%20Antiquaries">London Society of Antiquaries</a>, which was subsequently printed in their journal "<a href="Archaeologia%20%28London%29">Archaeologia</a>". Milner followed the medieval note in relating the book to Cuthbert, and compared its script to that of the Lindisfarne Gospels, by then in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, examining the two side by side. However he thought that "the binding seems to be of the time of Queen Elizabeth"! After the lecture it took some years to return to Stonyhurst as an intermediary forgot to forward it. That the binding was original, and the earliest European example, was realised during the 19th century, and when exhibited in 1862 it was described in the catalogue as "In unique coeval (?) binding". The whole appearance and feel of the book, and the accuracy of the text and beauty of the script was highly praised by scholars such as Bishop <a href="Christopher%20Wordsworth">Christopher Wordsworth</a> (1807–1885), nephew of the poet and an important <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> textual scholar, who described the book as "surpassing in delicate simplicity of neatness every manuscript that I have seen".

From 1950 onwards the binding was examined several times, but not altered, at Stonyhurst and the British Museum by <a href="Roger%20Powell%20%28bookbinder%29">Roger Powell</a>, "the leading bookbinder of his day", who had rebound both the <a href="Book%20of%20Kells">Book of Kells</a> and the <a href="Book%20of%20Durrow">Book of Durrow</a>, and also fully photographed by Peter Walters. Powell contributed chapters on the binding to the two major works covering the book, the first being "The Relics of St Cuthbert" in 1956, a large work with chapters on Cuthbert's coffin and each of the objects recovered from it. The main chapter on the St Cuthbert Gospel was by Sir <a href="Roger%20Mynors">Roger Mynors</a>, and Powell's chapter incorporated unpublished observations by the leading bindings expert Geoffrey Hobson. The second came in 1969, when T.J. (Julian) Brown, Professor of Palaeography at <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20London">King's College, London</a>, published a <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on the St Cuthbert Gospel with another chapter by Powell, who had altered his views in minor respects. Brown set out arguments for the dating of the manuscript to close to 698, which has been generally accepted. The book was placed on loan to the British Library in 1979 where it was very regularly on display, first in the British Museum building, and from 1999 in the Ritblat Gallery at the new St Pancras site of the Library, usually displaying the front cover. Despite minor damages, some of which appear to have occurred during the 20th century, the book is in extremely good condition for its age.

In 2011 an agreement was reached with the Jesuit British Province for the British Library to buy the book for £9 million. This required the purchase money to be raised by 31 March 2012, and a public appeal was launched. In the early stages the emphasis was on raising large individual donations, which included £4,500,000 from the <a href="National%20Heritage%20Memorial%20Fund">National Heritage Memorial Fund</a>, which distributes some of the money from the profits of the <a href="National%20Lottery%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Lottery</a>, £250,000 pledged by the <a href="Art%20Fund">Art Fund</a>, and "a similar sum" by The <a href="Garfield%20Weston">Garfield Weston</a> Foundation, and a large gift from the <a href="Christina%20Foyle">Foyle Foundation</a>. By early March 2012 the British Library reported that there was "only £1.5M left to raise", and on 17 April announced that the purchase had been completed, after their largest ever public appeal. The purchase "involved a formal partnership between the Library, Durham University and Durham Cathedral and an agreement that the book will be displayed to the public equally in London and the North East." There was a special display at the British Library until June 2012, and after coming off display for detailed investigation the book went on display in Durham in July 2013 in <a href="Durham%20University">Durham University</a>'s Palace Green Library. Subsequently it has been on display in both London and Durham, but in 2017 was resting off display. All the pages are accessible on the British Library website.

There was a long and somewhat controversial tradition of using manuscripts of the <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a>, or extracts such as the opening verse, as a protective or healing <a href="amulet">amulet</a> or charm, which was especially strong in early medieval Britain and Ireland. Manuscripts containing the text of one gospel only are very rare, except for those with lengthy explanatory <a href="Bible%20gloss">glosses</a>, and all the examples known to Julian Brown were of John. Disapproving references to such uses can be found in the writings of Saints <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> and <a href="Saint%20Eligius">Eligius</a>, and <a href="Alcuin">Alcuin</a>, but they are accepted by <a href="John%20Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a>, <a href="Augustine">Augustine</a>, who "expresses qualified approval" of using manuscripts as a cure for headaches, and <a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a>, who sent one to Queen <a href="Theodelinda">Theodelinda</a> for her son. Bede's prose "Life" mentions that Cuthbert combated the use of amulets and charms in the villages around <a href="Melrose%2C%20Scotland">Melrose</a>. However, like many other leading figures of the church, he may have distinguished between amulets based on Christian texts and symbols and other types.

The size of the Cuthbert Gospel places it within the Insular tradition of the "pocket gospels", of which eight Irish examples survive, including the <a href="Book%20of%20Dimma">Book of Dimma</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Mulling">Book of Mulling</a>, and <a href="Book%20of%20Deer">Book of Deer</a>, although all the others are or were originally texts of all four gospels, with the possible exception of a few pages from the Gospel of John enshrined with the <a href="Stowe%20Missal">Stowe Missal</a> in its <a href="cumdach">cumdach</a> or book-reliquary. There was a tradition of even smaller books, whose use seems to have been often amuletic, and a manuscript of John alone, with a page size of 72 x 56 mm, was found in a reliquary at <a href="Chartres%20Cathedral">Chartres Cathedral</a> in 1712. It is probably Italian from the 5th or 6th century, and the label it carried in 1712 saying it was a relic of St <a href="Leobinus">Leobinus</a>, a bishop of Chartes who died in about 556, may be correct. The other examples are mostly in Greek or the <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic language</a> and contain a variety of biblical texts, especially <a href="psalter">psalter</a>s. Julian Brown concludes that the three Latin manuscripts of John "seem to attest an early medieval practice of placing a complete Gospel of St. John in a shrine, as a protective amulet; and it seems reasonable to conclude that our manuscript was placed in St. Cuthbert's coffin to protect it".

Apart from being usually on display at the British Museum and British Library (see above), the book has been in the following exhibitions ( * denotes that there was a detailed published catalogue):


A digital version of the manuscript was produced to run on an <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> <a href="iPad">iPad</a>, which was exhibited in April 2012 at the British Library.

Eurasian treecreeper

The Eurasian treecreeper or common treecreeper ("Certhia familiaris") is a small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a> also known in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, where it is the only living member of its genus, simply as treecreeper. It is similar to other <a href="Certhia">treecreeper</a>s, and has a curved bill, patterned brown upperparts, whitish underparts, and long stiff tail feathers which help it creep up tree trunks. It can be most easily distinguished from the similar <a href="short-toed%20treecreeper">short-toed treecreeper</a>, which shares much of its <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an range, by its different song.

The Eurasian treecreeper has nine or more subspecies which breed in different parts of its range in temperate <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the short-toed treecreeper in western Europe it is more likely to be found in <a href="conifer">conifer</a>ous forests or at higher altitudes. It nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, and favours introduced <a href="Sequoiadendron%20giganteum">giant sequoia</a> as nest sites where they are available. The female typically lays five or six pink-speckled white eggs in the lined nest, but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals, including squirrels.

The Eurasian treecreeper is <a href="insectivore">insectivorous</a> and climbs up tree trunks like a mouse, to search for insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill. It then flies to the base of another tree with a distinctive erratic flight. This bird is solitary in winter, but may form communal roosts in cold weather.

Similar in appearance, all treecreepers are small birds with streaked and spotted brown upperparts, rufous rumps and whitish underparts. They have long decurved bills, and long rigid tail feathers that provide support as they creep up tree trunks looking for insects.

The Eurasian treecreeper is long and weighs 7.0–12.9 <a href="gram">g</a> (0.25–0.46 <a href="ounce">oz</a>). It has warm brown upperparts intricately patterned with black, buff and white, and a plain brown tail. Its belly, flanks and vent area are tinged with buff. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile has duller upperparts than the adult, and its underparts are dull white with dark fine spotting on the flanks.

The contact call is a very quiet, thin and high-pitched "sit", but the most distinctive call is a penetrating "tsree", with a <a href="vibrato">vibrato</a> quality, sometimes repeated as a series of notes. The male's song begins with "srrih, srrih" followed in turn by a few twittering notes, a longer descending ripple, and a whistle that falls and then rises.

The range of the Eurasian treecreeper overlaps with that of several other treecreepers, which can present local identification problems. In Europe, the Eurasian treecreeper shares much of its range with the short-toed treecreeper. Compared to that species, it is whiter below, warmer and more spotted above, and has a whiter <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> and slightly shorter bill. Visual identification, even in the hand, may be impossible for poorly marked birds. A singing treecreeper is usually identifiable, since short-toed treecreeper has a distinctive series of evenly spaced notes sounding quite different from the song of Eurasian treecreeper; however, both species have been known to sing the other's song.

Three Himalayan subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper are now sometimes given full species status as <a href="Hodgson%27s%20treecreeper">Hodgson's treecreeper</a>, for example by <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a>, but if they are retained as subspecies of Eurasian, they have to be distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers. The plain tail of Eurasian treecreeper differentiates it from <a href="bar-tailed%20treecreeper">bar-tailed treecreeper</a>, which has a distinctive barred tail pattern, and its white throat is an obvious difference from <a href="brown-throated%20treecreeper">brown-throated treecreeper</a>. <a href="Rusty-flanked%20treecreeper">Rusty-flanked treecreeper</a> is more difficult to separate from Eurasian, but has more contrasting cinnamon, rather than buff, flanks.

The North American <a href="brown%20creeper">brown creeper</a> has never been recorded in Europe, but an autumn <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> would be difficult to identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, brown creeper is more like short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.

The Eurasian treecreeper was first described under its current scientific name by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">Systema naturae</a>" in 1758. The binomial name is derived from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "kerthios", a small tree-dwelling bird described by <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and others, and <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "familiaris", familiar or common.

This species is one of a group of very similar <a href="Certhia">typical treecreeper</a> species, all placed in the single genus "<a href="Certhia">Certhia</a>". Eight species are currently recognised, in two <a href="evolution">evolution</a>ary lineages: a <a href="Holarctic">Holarctic</a> radiation, and a southern Asian group. The Holarctic group has a more warbling song, always (except in "C. familiaris" from <a href="China">China</a>) starting or ending with a shrill "sreeh". Species in the southern group, in contrast, have a faster-paced trill without the "sreeh" sound. All the species have distinctive vocalizations and some subspecies have been elevated to species on the basis of their calls. 

The Eurasian treecreeper belongs to the northern group, along with the <a href="North%20America">North America</a>n brown creeper, "C. americana", the short-toed treecreeper, "C. brachydactyla", of western Eurasia, and, if it is considered a separate species, Hodgson's treecreeper, "C. hodgsoni", from the southern rim of the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>.

The brown creeper has sometimes been considered to be a subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, but has closer affinities to short-toed treecreeper, and is normally now treated as a full species. Hodgson's treecreeper is a more recent proposed split following studies of its <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> <a href="mtDNA">mtDNA</a> <a href="DNA%20sequence">sequence</a> and song structure that indicate that it may well be a distinct species from "C. familiaris".

There are nine to twelve subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, depending on the taxonomic view taken, which are all very similar and often interbreed in areas where their ranges overlap. There is a general <a href="Cline%20%28population%20genetics%29">cline</a> in appearance from west to east across Eurasia, with subspecies becoming greyer above and whiter below, but this trend reverses east of the <a href="Amur%20River">Amur River</a>. The currently recognised subspecies are as follows:

The Eurasian treecreeper is the most widespread member of its genus, breeding in temperate woodlands across Eurasia from <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> to <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. It prefers mature trees, and in most of Europe, where it shares its range with short-toed treecreeper, it tends to be found mainly in <a href="conifer">conifer</a>ous forest, especially <a href="spruce">spruce</a> and <a href="fir">fir</a>. However, where it is the only treecreeper, as in European <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, or the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, it frequents broadleaved or mixed woodland in preference to conifers. It is also found in parks and large gardens.

The Eurasian treecreeper breeds down to sea level in the north of its range, but tends to be a highland species further south. In the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> it breeds above , in China from and in southern Japan from . The breeding areas have July <a href="isotherm%20%28contour%20line%29">isotherm</a>s between 14–16 °C and and 72–73 °F).

The Eurasian treecreeper is <a href="bird%20migration">non-migratory</a> in the milder west and south of its breeding range, but some northern birds move south in winter, and individuals breeding on mountains may descend to a lower altitude in winter. Winter movements and post-breeding dispersal may lead to vagrancy outside the normal range. Wintering migrants of the Asian subspecies have been recorded in <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> and China, and the nominate form has been recorded west of its breeding range as far as <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The Eurasian treecreeper has also occurred as a vagrant to the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a> (where the short-toed is the resident species), <a href="Majorca">Majorca</a> and the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>.

This species has an extensive range of about 10 million km (3.8 million square miles). It has a large population, including an estimated 11–20 million individuals in Europe alone. Population trends have not been quantified, but the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.

It is common through much of its range, but in the northernmost areas it is rare, since it is vulnerable to hard winters, especially if its feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the trees or freezing rain. It is also uncommon in Turkey and the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>. In the west of its range it has spread to the <a href="Outer%20Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a> in Scotland, pushed further north in <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, and first bred in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> in 1993.

The Eurasian treecreeper breeds from the age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the introduced North American <a href="Sequoiadendron%20giganteum">giant sequoia</a> is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its soft bark. Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, grass or bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, <a href="lichen">lichen</a> or spider web.

In Europe, the typical clutch of five–six eggs is laid between March and June, but in Japan three–five eggs are laid from May to July. The eggs are white with very fine pinkish speckles mainly at the broad end, measure and weigh of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated by the female alone for 13–17 days until the <a href="altricial">altricial</a> downy chicks hatch; they are then fed by both parents, but brooded by the female alone, for a further 15–17 days to fledging. Juveniles return to the nest for a few nights after <a href="fledging">fledging</a>. About 20% of pairs, mainly in the south and west, raise a second brood.

Predators of treecreeper nests and young include the <a href="great%20spotted%20woodpecker">great spotted woodpecker</a>, <a href="red%20squirrel">red squirrel</a>, and small <a href="mustelidae">mustelids</a>, and predation is about three times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less fragmented woodlands). The predation rate increases with the amount of forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation. This species is parasitised in the nest by the <a href="moorhen%20flea">moorhen flea</a>, "Dasypsyllus gallinulae". The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the maximum recorded age is eight years and ten months.

The Eurasian treecreeper typically seeks <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> food on tree trunks, starting near the tree base and working its way up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a <a href="nuthatch">nuthatch</a>, it does not come down trees head first, but flies to the base of another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract <a href="insect">insect</a>s and <a href="spider">spider</a>s from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles, and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.

The female Eurasian treecreeper forages primarily on the upper parts of the tree trunks, while the male uses the lower parts. A study in <a href="Finland">Finland</a> found that if a male disappears, the unpaired female will forage at lower heights, spend less time on each tree and have shorter foraging bouts than a paired female.

This bird may sometimes join <a href="mixed-species%20feeding%20flock">mixed-species feeding flock</a>s in winter, but it does not appear to share the resources found by accompanying <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">tits</a> and <a href="goldcrest">goldcrest</a>s, and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock. <a href="Formica%20rufa%20group">Wood ants</a> share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.

As a small woodland bird with <a href="crypsis">cryptic</a> plumage and a quiet call, the Eurasian treecreeper is easily overlooked as it hops <a href="mouse">mouse-like</a> up a vertical trunk, progressing in short hops, using its stiff tail and widely splayed feet as support. Nevertheless, it is not wary, and is largely indifferent to the presence of humans. It has a distinctive erratic and undulating flight, alternating fluttering <a href="butterfly">butterfly-like</a> wing beats with side-slips and tumbles. Migrating birds may fly by day or night, but the extent of movements is usually masked by resident populations. It is solitary in winter, but in cold weather up to a dozen or more birds will roost together in a suitable sheltered crevice.

Jack Sparrow

<a href="Sea%20captain">Captain</a> Jack Sparrow is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the "<a href="Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20%28film%20series%29">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>" film series. The character was created by screenwriters <a href="Ted%20Elliott%20%28screenwriter%29">Ted Elliott</a> and <a href="Terry%20Rossio">Terry Rossio</a>, and is portrayed by <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a>. The characterization of Sparrow is based on a combination of <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>' guitarist <a href="Keith%20Richards">Keith Richards</a> and <a href="Looney%20Tunes">Looney Tunes</a> cartoon character <a href="Pep%C3%A9%20Le%20Pew">Pepé Le Pew</a>. He first appears in the 2003 film "". He later appears in the sequels "" (2006), "" (2007), "" (2011), and "" (2017).

In the films, Sparrow is one of the nine pirate lords in the Brethren Court, the Pirate Lords of the Seven Seas. He can be treacherous and survives mostly by using wit and negotiation rather than by force, opting to flee most dangerous situations and to fight only when necessary. Sparrow is introduced seeking to regain his ship, the "<a href="Black%20Pearl">Black Pearl</a>", from his mutinous first mate, <a href="Hector%20Barbossa">Hector Barbossa</a>. Later he attempts to escape his blood debt to the legendary <a href="Davy%20Jones%20%28Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%29">Davy Jones</a> while fighting the <a href="East%20India%20Trading%20Company">East India Trading Company</a>.

The "Pirates of the Caribbean" series was inspired by the Disney <a href="Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20%28attraction%29">theme park ride of the same name</a>, and when the ride was revamped in 2006, the character of Captain Jack Sparrow was added to it. He headlined the <a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Captain%20Jack%20Sparrow%20%28attraction%29">Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow</a> attraction at <a href="Disney%27s%20Hollywood%20Studios">Disney's Hollywood Studios</a>, and is the subject of spin-off novels, including a children's book series "", which chronicles his teenage years.

Captain Jack Sparrow first appears in "" (2003). 

Jack Sparrow arrives in <a href="Port%20Royal">Port Royal</a> in Jamaica to commandeer a ship. Despite rescuing <a href="Elizabeth%20Swann">Elizabeth Swann</a>, the daughter of <a href="Weatherby%20Swann">Governor Weatherby Swann</a>, from drowning, he is jailed for piracy. That night, a cursed <a href="Piracy">pirate</a> ship called "<a href="Black%20Pearl">Black Pearl</a>" attacks Port Royal and Elizabeth is kidnapped. "Black Pearl"s <a href="Sea%20captain">captain</a>, <a href="Hector%20Barbossa">Hector Barbossa</a>, desperately seeks one last gold coin to break an ancient <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> curse that he and his crew are under. A blacksmith named <a href="Will%20Turner">Will Turner</a> frees Sparrow to aid him in rescuing Elizabeth. They commandeer HMS "Interceptor" and recruit a motley crew in <a href="Tortuga%20%28Haiti%29">Tortuga</a>, Haiti before heading to <a href="Isla%20de%20Muerta">Isla de Muerta</a>, where Elizabeth is held captive. Along the way, Will learns that Sparrow was "Black Pearl"s captain until Barbossa led a mutiny ten years earlier and took over the ship, marooning Sparrow on an island to die. Sparrow tells Turner that his father was a pirate known as "Bootstrap" Bill Turner.

The rescue attempt goes awry and Barbossa maroons Jack and Elizabeth on the same island upon which he had stranded Sparrow before. Elizabeth creates a signal fire from rum barrels and they are rescued by the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Sparrow cuts a deal with Commodore <a href="James%20Norrington">James Norrington</a> to lead Norrington to "Black Pearl". Norrington refuses until Elizabeth, desperate to save Will, spontaneously accepts Norrington's earlier marriage proposal. Right before the film's climactic battle with the pirates at Isla de Muerta, Sparrow swipes a cursed coin from the treasure chest, making himself immortal and capable of dueling Barbossa. He shoots his nemesis with the pistol he has carried for ten years just as Will breaks the curse, killing Barbossa. Despite having assisted the Navy, Sparrow is sentenced to hang.

At Sparrow's execution in Port Royal, Will saves Sparrow, but they are quickly captured. Elizabeth intervenes, declaring her love for Will who is pardoned, while Sparrow escapes by tumbling off a sea wall. "Black Pearl" and her new crew arrive in time to retrieve him, and he becomes captain once more. Impressed by the wily pirate, Norrington allows him one day's head start before giving chase.

A year following the events of the first film, Sparrow searches for the Dead Man's Chest, which contains the heart of <a href="Davy%20Jones%20%28Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%29">Captain Davy Jones</a>. Sparrow made a bargain with Jones to raise the sunken "Black Pearl" and make Sparrow captain for thirteen years. Now the debt is due, and Sparrow must either serve one hundred years aboard the "<a href="The%20Flying%20Dutchman%20%28Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%29">Flying Dutchman</a>", or be dragged to <a href="Davy%20Jones%27s%20Locker%20%28Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%29">Davy Jones's Locker</a> by the <a href="Kraken%20%28Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%29">Kraken</a>. If he can find the Dead Man's Chest Sparrow can free his soul and control Jones and the seas.

Adding to Sparrow's woes, <a href="Cutler%20Beckett">Lord Cutler Beckett</a> of the <a href="East%20India%20Trading%20Company">East India Trading Company</a> has a personal score to settle with Sparrow. Beckett wants the chest and forces Will Turner to search for Sparrow and his magic compass. Turner locates Sparrow and his crew on <a href="Pelegosto">Pelegosto</a>, held captive by cannibals who intend to eat Sparrow. They escape, and voyage to <a href="Tia%20Dalma">Tia Dalma</a> (a magical woman later revealed to be the Goddess, Calypso, bound in human form as Dalma, and former lover of Jones). Dalma immediately sees destiny in Will, and provides Sparrow with a jar of dirt - Jones can only set foot on land once every 10 years, and since land is where Sparrow is safe, Dalma suggests with the dirt that he takes land with him.

Sparrow strikes a new deal with Jones to deliver one hundred souls in exchange for his own. Jones agrees but keeps Turner as a "good faith payment". Sparrow is recruiting sailors in Tortuga when he encounters Elizabeth Swann and James Norrington, the latter having succumbed to alcohol. Sparrow convinces Elizabeth that Turner can be freed by using the magic compass to find the chest. The duo head for <a href="Isla%20Cruces">Isla Cruces</a> and find Will, who escaped Jones's ship and has stolen the key to the Chest. Turner wants to stab Jones's heart and free his father from Jones's servitude, while Norrington plots to restore his career by delivering the heart to Beckett. Sparrow wants it to convince Jones to call off the Kraken.

Norrington escapes with the heart amid a battle with Jones's crew, and Jones summons the Kraken. Realizing Sparrow is the target, Elizabeth traps him aboard the "Black Pearl" as the crew abandons the ship, and kisses him while she handcuffs him to the mast. Then, the monster devours Sparrow and drags the ship and his soul to Davy Jones's Locker. The surviving crew seeks refuge with Tia Dalma who produces a captain she says can rescue Sparrow: a resurrected Hector Barbossa.

Two months following the events of the second film, with Davy Jones's heart in his possession and the "Flying Dutchman" under his command, Cutler Beckett begins exterminating all pirates. To combat Beckett, the nine pirate lords of the <a href="Brethren%20Court">Brethren Court</a> convene at Shipwreck Cove. Only Jack Sparrow is missing, killed and sent to Davy Jones's Locker at the end of the previous film. Sparrow, as Pirate Lord of the Caribbean, must attend, as he did not bequeathe to a designated heir his "<a href="Spanish%20dollar">piece of eight</a>", a pirate lord's marker. The collective "nine pieces of eight" are needed to free sea goddess <a href="Calypso%20%28Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%29">Calypso</a> to defeat Beckett. With <a href="Elizabeth%20Swann">Elizabeth Swann</a> and Will Turner, Barbossa leads Sparrow's crew to Davy Jones's Locker using stolen navigational charts from the pirate lord <a href="Sao%20Feng">Sao Feng</a> (<a href="Chow%20Yun-fat">Chow Yun-fat</a>). After the crew locate him, Sparrow deciphers a clue on the charts allowing them to escape the Locker.

At the Brethren Court, Elizabeth has succeeded Captain Sao Feng as a Pirate Lord and is elected "Pirate King" after Sparrow breaks a stalemate vote. Sparrow is briefly reunited with his father, Captain Teague. During a <a href="parley">parley</a> with Beckett and Jones, Sparrow is traded for Turner, whom Jones and Beckett had captured. When Sparrow negotiates with Beckett in the extended version of the film, it is revealed that he once sailed the "Black Pearl" under Beckett's command, but deserted after refusing to carry slave cargo. The "Black Pearl" battles the "Flying Dutchman" during a maelstrom created by Calypso, during which Sparrow steals Jones's heart to become immortal. When Jones mortally wounds Turner, Sparrow instead chooses to save Turner by helping him stab the heart, which kills Jones and makes Turner the "Dutchman"s captain. Together, the "Pearl" and the "Dutchman" destroy Beckett's ship. At the end, Barbossa again commandeers the "Pearl" and Sao Feng's charts, stranding Sparrow and Gibbs in Tortuga. However, Sparrow had managed to cut out the navigational section of the charts and with them begins to search for the legendary <a href="Fountain%20of%20Youth">Fountain of Youth</a>.

After failing to find the Fountain of Youth, Sparrow arrives in London only to learn someone is gathering a crew by using his name. While searching for the imposter, he saves Gibbs from being hanged but is captured by the Royal Guards. They present him to King <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">George II</a>. Sparrow is surprised to learn Captain Barbossa is now a privateer in the Royal Navy. Sparrow refuses to negotiate with them to locate the Fountain of Youth and escapes. Soon he crosses paths with his impersonator, an old flame named <a href="Angelica%20%28Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%29">Angelica</a> (<a href="Pen%C3%A9lope%20Cruz">Penélope Cruz</a>). She <a href="Shanghaiing">shanghais</a> him to serve aboard the "<a href="Queen%20Anne%27s%20Revenge">Queen Anne's Revenge</a>", the ship captained by her father <a href="Blackbeard%20%28Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%29">Blackbeard</a> (<a href="Ian%20McShane">Ian McShane</a>), who forces Sparrow to search for the Fountain of Youth.

Sparrow fails in his attempt to take over the ship in a mutiny against Blackbeard and save the naive Angelica from her evil father. After encountering dangerous mermaids, Barbossa, and the Spanish Navy, Sparrow locates the Fountain of Youth. When Angelica is wounded, he tricks Blackbeard into sacrificing himself to save her, and Angelica blames Sparrow for her father's death. Sparrow and Angelica acknowledge their feelings for one another, but Sparrow maroons Angelica on an island, believing she may avenge her father's death. Gibbs, meanwhile, has retrieved the shrunken "Black Pearl" from Blackbeard's collection of shrunken ships in the hope of restoring it to normal size. Though he has forfeited his opportunity for immortality, Sparrow settles for being famous as the one who found the Fountain of Youth. Following the film's end credits, Angelica's voodoo doll of Sparrow has drifted to the island that she is marooned on.

Sparrow returns in the fifth film, portrayed once again by <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a>. Some time after the quest for the Fountain of Youth, Jack has reassembled a small crew, but the "Black Pearl" is still trapped in a bottle, his new ship the "Dying Gull" has never left berth, and his latest plans have met with failure. Meanwhile, his rival Barbossa has become the richest and most powerful pirate of the seven seas.

Sparrow and his crew attempt to rob the new bank of <a href="St.%20Martin">St. Martin</a>. The robbery is a success, but all the gold in it had fallen while they were dragging the locker, and Sparrow's crew abandons him. Despondent, Jack trades his magical compass for a drink. However, this betrayal of the compass releases an old enemy of Sparrow, whom holds a serious grudge against him; the ruthless undead pirate hunter Captain Salazar. Years previously, Jack had defeated Salazar by tricking him into sailing his ship into the Devil's Triangle, where Salazar and his crew were cursed to live as the undead. Salazar states that Jack perched in the ship's rigging like a "little bird", earning him the name "Jack the Sparrow". It was during this event that Jack received his compass, as well as his characteristic gear.

While in prison, Jack is contacted by Henry Turner, the son of Will and Elizabeth, to seek his aid in finding the Trident of Poseidon. Remembering Elizabeth and Will from his previous misadventures, Jack agrees but not before expressing some hesitation. The next day, Sparrow is sentenced to be executed by <a href="guillotine">guillotine</a> (by Jack's accidental choosing), but is rescued by Henry and his crew. Aided by aspiring astronomer Carina, Jack and Henry attempt to locate the Trident of Poseidon, as both are in need of its power to break curses related to the sea. Barbossa releases the "Pearl" from its bottle, giving them a chance to outrun Salazar. Jack and Barbossa discuss the fact that Carina is in truth Barbossa's long-lost daughter, whom he had left at an orphanage in order to give her a chance for a better life. Jack attempts to use the secret to <a href="blackmail">blackmail</a> Barbossa, but fails.

They are able to track the Trident to its resting place. Though Salazar nearly kills Jack, they are able to destroy the Trident. With the destruction of the Trident, Salazar and his crew become mortal again. Jack, Henry and Carina escape as Barbossa sacrifices himself to kill Salazar. Despite their differences, Jack mourns Barbossa's death. Later, Jack watches Will and Elizabeth's reunion before he departs, the "Black Pearl" and his compass once again in his possession.

When writing the screenplay for "The Curse of the Black Pearl", <a href="Ted%20Elliott%20%28screenwriter%29">Ted Elliott</a> and <a href="Terry%20Rossio">Terry Rossio</a> envisioned Captain Jack Sparrow as a supporting character in the vein of <a href="Bugs%20Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a> and <a href="Groucho%20Marx">Groucho Marx</a>. The producers saw him as a young <a href="Burt%20Lancaster">Burt Lancaster</a>. Director <a href="Gore%20Verbinski">Gore Verbinski</a> admitted, "The first film was a movie, and then Jack was put into it almost. He doesn't have the obligations of the plot in the same ways that the other characters have. He meanders his way through, and he kind of affects everybody else." Sparrow represents an ethical pirate, with <a href="Captain%20Barbossa">Captain Barbossa</a> as his corrupt <a href="foil%20%28literature%29">foil</a>. His true motives usually remain masked, and whether he is honorable or evil depends on the audience's perspective. This acts as part of Will Turner's arc, in which Sparrow tells him a pirate can be a good man, like <a href="Bootstrap%20Bill%20Turner">his father</a>.

Following the success of "The Curse of the Black Pearl", the challenge to creating a sequel was, according to Verbinski, "You don't want just the Jack Sparrow movie. It's like having a garlic milkshake. He's the spice and you need a lot of straight men ... Let's not give them too much Jack. It's like too much dessert or too much of a good thing." Although "Dead Man's Chest" was written to propel the trilogy's plot, Sparrow's state-of-mind as he is pursued by Davy Jones becomes increasingly edgy, and the writers concocted the cannibal sequence to show that he was in danger whether on land or at sea. Sparrow is perplexed over his attraction to Elizabeth Swann, and attempts to justify it throughout the film.

"At World's End" was meant to return it tonally to a <a href="character%20piece">character piece</a>. Sparrow, in particular, is tinged with madness after extended solitary confinement in Davy Jones's Locker, and now desires immortality. Sparrow struggles with what it takes to be a moral person, after his honest streak caused his doom in the second film. This is mainly shown by his increasingly erratic behaviour and Jack's hallucinations, which appeared to be simply his deranged mind in the beginning where dozens of "Jack Sparrows" appeared to crew the ship in his solitary exile, but later the hallucinations grew more important and there were mainly two "Jacks" constantly arguing about which path to follow: the immortality or the mortality. The last hallucination took place while Jack was imprisoned on the Dutchman, where his honest streak won. By the end of "At World's End", Sparrow is sailing to the Fountain of Youth, an early concept for the second film. Rossio said in 2007 that a fourth film was possible, and producer <a href="Jerry%20Bruckheimer">Jerry Bruckheimer</a> expressed interest in a spin-off. Gore Verbinski concurred that "all of the stories set in motion by the first film have been resolved. If there ever were another "Pirates of the Caribbean" film, I would start fresh and focus on the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow."

"" was first announced on September 28, 2008, during a Disney event at the <a href="Kodak%20Theater">Kodak Theater</a>. Verbinski did not return to direct the fourth installment and was replaced by <a href="Rob%20Marshall">Rob Marshall</a>. The movie uses elements from <a href="Tim%20Powers">Tim Powers</a>' novel <a href="On%20Stranger%20Tides">of the same name</a>, particularly <a href="Blackbeard">Blackbeard</a> and the Fountain of Youth, but the film is not a straight adaptation of the novel.

Looking to do a <a href="family%20film">family film</a>, Johnny Depp visited the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Studios%20%28Burbank%29">Walt Disney Studios</a> in 2001 when he heard of plans to adapt the <a href="Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20%28theme%20park%20ride%29">Pirates of the Caribbean</a> ride into a film. Depp was excited by the possibility of reviving an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the "Black Pearl" were not in search of treasure but trying to return it to lift a curse on them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.

At the first <a href="read-through">read-through</a>, Depp surprised the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. He researched 18th-century pirates and, seeing parallels with modern rock stars, modeled his performance on <a href="Keith%20Richards">Keith Richards</a>. Richards later appeared in two cameos as Jack's father, <a href="Captain%20Teague">Captain Teague</a>, in "At World's End" and "On Stranger Tides". Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because Orlando Bloom would play the traditional <a href="Errol%20Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>-type character. Depp improvised the film's final line, "Now, bring me that horizon", which the writer called his favorite line. Disney executives were initially confused by Depp's performance, questioning whether the character was drunk or gay. While watching the rushes, Disney CEO <a href="Michael%20Eisner">Michael Eisner</a> proclaimed Depp was ruining the film. Depp's response to Disney executives was they could trust him with his choices or let him go. Many industry insiders questioned Depp's casting, as he was an unconventional actor not known for working within the traditional studio system.

Depp's performance won acclaim from film critics. Alan Morrison found it "Gloriously over-the-top ... In terms of physical precision and verbal delivery, it's a master-class in comedy acting." <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> praised Depp for drawing away from the character as written and found Depp's performance "original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie ... his behavior shows a lifetime of rehearsal". Depp won a <a href="Screen%20Actor%27s%20Guild">Screen Actor's Guild</a> award for his performance, and was nominated for a <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a> and the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>, the first in his career. "<a href="Film%20School%20Rejects">Film School Rejects</a>" argued the film made Depp as much a movie star as he was a <a href="character%20actor">character actor</a>.

Depp's return in "Dead Man's Chest" was the first time he had ever made a sequel. <a href="Drew%20McWeeny">Drew McWeeny</a> wrote, "Remember how cool Han Solo was in "Star Wars" the first time you saw it? And then remember how much cooler he seemed when "<a href="The%20Empire%20Strikes%20Back">Empire</a>" came out? This is that big a jump." Depp received an <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Award">MTV Movie Award</a> and a <a href="Teen%20Choice%20Award">Teen Choice Award</a> for "Dead Man's Chest", and was nominated for an <a href="Empire%20Award">Empire Award</a> and another Golden Globe. For his performance in "At World's End", Depp won an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance, as well as a <a href="People%27s%20Choice%20Award">People's Choice Award</a>, a <a href="Kids%27%20Choice%20Award">Kids' Choice Award</a>, and another Teen Choice Award. He has signed on to reprise the role for future sequels.

Depp wears a <a href="Dreadlocks">dreadlock</a> wig in a <a href="rock-and-roll">rock-and-roll</a> approach to a pirate aesthetic. He wears a red bandanna and numerous objects in his hair, influenced by Keith Richards' habit of collecting souvenirs from his travels; Sparrow's decorations include his "piece of eight". Sparrow wears <a href="kohl%20%28cosmetics%29">kohl</a> around his eyes, which was inspired by Depp's study of nomads, whom he compared to pirates, and he wore contacts that acted as sunglasses. Sparrow has several gold teeth, two of which belong to Depp, although they were applied during filming. Depp initially forgot to have them removed after shooting "The Curse of the Black Pearl", and wore them throughout the shooting of the sequels. Like all aspects of Depp's performance, Disney initially expressed great concern over Depp's teeth. Sparrow wears his goatee in two braids. Initially wire was used in them, but the wires were abandoned because they made the braids stick up when Depp lay down. Sparrow has numerous tattoos, and has been <a href="Human%20branding">branded</a> a pirate on his right arm by Cutler Beckett, underneath a tattoo of a sparrow.

Depp collaborated with costume designer Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking a <a href="tricorne">tricorne</a> as Sparrow's signature leather hat; to make Sparrow's unique, the other characters did not wear leather hats. A rubber version was used for the scene in "Dead Man's Chest" when the hat floats on water. Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight silk tweed frock coat throughout the series, and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes. The official line is that none of the costumes from "The Curse of the Black Pearl" survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts. However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition of screen costumes in <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>, England. It was a nightmare for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to <a href="silkscreen">silkscreen</a> it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel. Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.

Sparrow's weapons are genuine 18th-century pieces: his sword dates to the 1740s and his pistol is from the 1760s. Both were made in London. Depp used two pistols on set, one of rubber. Both survived production of the first film. Sparrow's magic compass also survived into the sequels, though director Gore Verbinski had a red arrow added to the dial as it became a more prominent prop. As it does not act like a normal compass, a magnet was used to make it spin. Sparrow wears four rings, two of which belong to Depp. Depp bought the green ring in 1989 and the gold ring is a replica of a 2400-year-old ring Depp gave to the crew, though the original was later stolen. The other two are props to which Depp gave backstories: the gold-and-black ring is stolen from a Spanish widow Sparrow seduced and the green dragon ring recalls his adventures in the Far East. Among Depp's additional ideas was the necklace made of human toes that Sparrow wears as the Pelegosto prepare to eat him, and the sceptre was based on one a friend of Depp's owned.

During the course of the trilogy, Sparrow undergoes physical transformations. In "The Curse of the Black Pearl", Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. Like all the actors playing the "Black Pearl" crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and his shots as a skeleton were shot again without him. Depp reprised the scene again on a <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a> stage. In "At World's End", Sparrow hallucinates a version of himself as a member of Davy Jones's crew, adhered to a wall and encrusted with barnacles. Verbinski oversaw that the design retained Sparrow's distinctive look, and rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old.

According to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Sparrow is a <a href="trickster">trickster</a> who uses wit and deceit to attain his goals, preferring to end disputes verbally instead of by force. He walks with a slightly drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship "Interceptor", which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: "That's got to be the best pirate I have ever seen". Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: "So it would seem", in sharp contrast to what he had previously proclaimed: "You are without doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of". In the third film, while he leaves Beckett's ship stranded and makes off, Lieutenant Groves asks him: "Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?"

Though a skilled swordsman, Sparrow prefers to use his superior intelligence during combat, exploiting his environment to turn the tables on his foes, reasoning "Why fight when you can negotiate?" He uses strategies of non-violent negotiation and turning his enemies against each other. He invokes parleys and tempts his enemies away from their murderous intentions, encouraging them to see the bigger picture, as he does when he persuades Barbossa to delay returning to mortal form so he can battle the Royal Navy. He often uses complex wordplay and vocabulary to confound his enemies, and it is suggested that his pacifism may be one reason Barbossa and the crew of the "Black Pearl" mutinied.
The character is portrayed as having created, or at least contributed to, his own reputation. When Gibbs tells Will that Sparrow escaped from a desert island by strapping two sea turtles together, Sparrow embellishes the story by claiming the rope was made from hair from his own back, while in reality, Sparrow escaped the island by bartering with rum traders. The video game "" bases itself on these <a href="tall%20tale">tall tale</a>s, including the sacking of <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a> port without firing a shot. Depp has likened pirates to rock stars in that their fame preceded them. Sparrow insists on being addressed as "Captain" and often gives the farewell, "This is the day you will always remember as the day that you "almost" caught Captain Jack Sparrow!" which is sometimes humorously cut off. When Norrington accuses him of being the worst pirate he has ever heard of, Sparrow replies, "But you "have" heard of me." In a deleted scene from "The Curse of the Black Pearl" Sparrow ponders being "the immortal Captain Jack Sparrow", and during "At World's End" he again is interested in immortality, although his father, Captain Teague, warns it can be a terrible curse. Sparrow ponders being "Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate," as the East India Trading Company purges piracy.

Despite his many heroics, Sparrow is a pirate and a morally ambiguous character. When agreeing to trade 100 souls, including Will, to Davy Jones in exchange for his freedom, Jones asks Sparrow whether he can, "condemn an innocent man—a "friend"—to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?" After a hesitation Sparrow merrily replies, "Yep! I'm good with it!" He carelessly runs up debts with <a href="Anamaria">Anamaria</a>, Davy Jones, and the other pirate lords. Sao Feng, pirate lord of <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, is particularly hateful towards him. In a cowardly moment, Sparrow abandons his crew during the Kraken's attack, but underlying loyalty and morality compel him to return and save them. Sparrow claims to be a man of his word, and expresses surprise that people doubt his truthfulness; there is no murder on his criminal record.

Depp partly based the character on <a href="Pep%C3%A9%20Le%20Pew">Pepé Le Pew</a>, a <a href="Promiscuity%23Male%20promiscuity">womanizing</a> <a href="skunk">skunk</a> from "<a href="Looney%20Tunes">Looney Tunes</a>". Sparrow claims to have a "tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature," although his conquests are often left with a sour memory of him. Former flames, Scarlett and Giselle, usually slap him or anyone looking for him. His witty charm easily attracts women, and even has Elizabeth questioning her feelings. Verbinski noted phallic connotations in Sparrow's relationship with his vessel, as he grips the <a href="ship%27s%20wheel">ship's wheel</a>. The "Black Pearl" is described as "the only ship which can outrun the "Flying Dutchman"". The <a href="Freudian">Freudian</a> overtones continue in the third film when Sparrow and Barbossa battle for captaincy of the "Black Pearl", showing off the length of their telescopes, and in a deleted scene, they fight over the steering wheel. Sparrow claims his "first and only love is the sea," and describes his ship as representing freedom. Davy Jones's Locker is represented as a desert, symbolizing his personal hell.

Captain Jack Sparrow has become one of the most iconic film characters of all time. When "Dead Man's Chest" grossed over worldwide, Ian Nathan attributed this to Sparrow's popularity: ""Pirates", the franchise, only had to turn up. There was a powerful holdover from the cheeky delights of its debut, something we hadn't felt since the <a href="Clone%20Wars%20%28Star%20Wars%29">Clone Wars</a> called it a day." "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" in 2006 declared Depp's performance the seventy-fourth "thing that rocked our world" and later named him the eighth greatest movie character of all time. In 2015, a new poll of the 100 greatest film characters of all time placed him as the fourteenth greatest. A survey of more than 3,000 people showed Jack Sparrow was the most popular <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> costume of 2006, and a 2007 poll held by the <a href="Internet%20Movie%20Database">Internet Movie Database</a> showed Sparrow to be the second most popular live action hero after <a href="Indiana%20Jones">Indiana Jones</a>. In a 2007 <a href="Pearl%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%26amp%3B%20Dean">Pearl & Dean</a> poll, Jack Sparrow was listed as Depp's most popular performance.

Todd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is the only element of the films that will remain timeless. According to Sharon Eberson, the character's popularity can be attributed to his being a "scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in". Film history professor Jonathan Kuntz attributed Sparrow's popularity to the increased questioning of masculinity in the 21st century, and Sparrow's personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. <a href="Leonard%20Maltin">Leonard Maltin</a> concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously. Mark Fox noted Sparrow is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes. Sparrow is listed by <a href="IGN">IGN</a> as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he "lives for himself and the freedom to do whatever it is that he damn well pleases. Precious few film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has." "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" put it on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "Part Keith Richards rift, part sozzled lounge lizard, Johnny Depp's swizzleshtick pirate was definitely one of the most dazzling characters of the decade." In June 2010, Sparrow was named one of "Entertainment Weekly" "100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years".

Jack Sparrow also appears in <a href="Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20video%20games">video games</a> and books spun off the "Pirates of the Caribbean" <a href="media%20franchise">media franchise</a>. Jack also appears in the "<a href="Disney%20Infinity">Disney Infinity</a>" series, where he is voiced by Jared Butler, and in the "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>" series, first in 2005's "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20II">Kingdom Hearts II</a>", where he is voiced by <a href="James%20Arnold%20Taylor">James Arnold Taylor</a>, and again in 2019's "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20III">Kingdom Hearts III</a>", reprised by Butler.

"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Complete Visual Guide" gives a backstory to Sparrow in which he was born on a pirate ship during a typhoon in the Indian Ocean and was trained to <a href="Fencing">fence</a> by an Italian. Books following Sparrow's adventures before the events of the film include a twelve-book series focusing on his teenage years entitled "", and a five-books "" series. In 2011, <a href="Ann%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BC.%20Crispin">Ann C. Crispin</a> wrote a novel titled "", which follows Jack's adventures as a merchant captain for the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Trading Company</a>.

In 2011, comedy group <a href="the%20Lonely%20Island">the Lonely Island</a>, in collaboration with ballad singer <a href="Michael%20Bolton">Michael Bolton</a>, released a song <a href="Jack%20Sparrow%20%28song%29">named for Jack</a>.

The Order was created in 1783 by <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a> at the request of the then <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland">Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</a>, <a href="George%20Nugent-Temple-Grenville%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Buckingham">The 3rd Earl Temple</a> (created The 1st <a href="Marquess%20of%20Buckingham">Marquess of Buckingham</a> in 1784). The regular creation of knights of <a href="Saint%20Patrick">Saint Patrick</a> lasted until 1922, when most of Ireland gained independence as the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a>, a <a href="dominion">dominion</a> within what was then known as the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth of Nations</a>. While the Order technically still exists, no knight of St Patrick has been created since 1936, and the last surviving knight, <a href="Prince%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester</a>, died in 1974. <a href="Elizabeth%20II">The Queen</a>, however, remains the Sovereign of the Order, and one officer, the <a href="Norroy%20and%20Ulster%20King%20of%20Arms">Ulster King of Arms</a> (now combined with <a href="Norroy%20King%20of%20Arms">Norroy King of Arms</a>), also survives. <a href="Saint%20Patrick">St Patrick</a> is <a href="patron%20saint">patron</a> of the order; its motto is "<a href="Quis%20separabit%3F">Quis separabit?</a>", <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "Who will separate [us]?": an allusion to the <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> translation of <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Romans">Romans</a> 8:35, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?"

Most British orders of chivalry cover the entire kingdom, but the three most exalted ones each pertain to one <a href="Constituent%20countries%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">constituent country</a> only. The Order of St Patrick, which pertains to Ireland, is the most junior of these three in precedence and age. Its equivalent in <a href="England">England</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">The Most Noble Order of the Garter</a>, is the oldest order of chivalry in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, dating to the middle fourteenth century. The <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> equivalent is <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Thistle">The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle</a>, dating in its modern form to 1687.

The order was founded in 1783, a year after the grant of substantial autonomy to Ireland, as a means of rewarding (or obtaining) political support in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ireland">Irish Parliament</a>. The <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Order of the Bath</a>, founded in 1725, was instituted for similar reasons. The statutes of the Order restricted membership to men who were both <a href="knights">knights</a> and <a href="gentlemen">gentlemen</a>, the latter being defined as having three generations of "noblesse" (i.e. ancestors bearing coats of arms) on both their father's and mother's side. In practice, however, only <a href="Peerage%20of%20Ireland">Irish Peers</a> (and occasional foreign princes with tenuous or no Irish connections) were ever appointed to the Order. The cross of St Patrick (a red saltire on a white background) was chosen as one of the symbols of the Order. A <a href="Flag%20of%20St.%20Patrick">flag of this design</a> was later incorporated into the <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a>. Its association with St. Patrick or with Ireland prior to the foundation of the Order is unclear, however. One of the first knights was <a href="William%20FitzGerald%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Leinster">The 2nd Duke of Leinster</a>, whose arms carry the same cross.

The Order of St Patrick earned international coverage when, in 1907, its insignia, known generally as the <a href="Irish%20Crown%20Jewels">Irish Crown Jewels</a>, were stolen from the Bedford Tower in <a href="Dublin%20Castle">Dublin Castle</a> shortly before a visit by the Order's Sovereign, <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King Edward VII</a>. Their whereabouts remain a mystery.

The last non-Royal member appointed to the Order was <a href="James%20Hamilton%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Abercorn">the 3rd Duke of Abercorn</a> in 1922, who served as the first <a href="Governor%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">Governor of Northern Ireland</a>. When the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> left the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a> in December of that same year, the Irish <a href="Executive%20Council%20of%20the%20Irish%20Free%20State">Executive Council</a> under <a href="W.%20T.%20Cosgrave">W. T. Cosgrave</a> chose to make no further appointments to the Order. The British Government continued to entertain hopes for the Order's revival as a pan-Irish institution. Therefore, while there was no legal or constitutional bar to the British Government continuing to make appointments from among British subjects resident in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, it chose not to do so.

Since then, only three people have been appointed to the Order, all members of the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">British Royal Family</a>. The then-<a href="Edward%20VIII">Prince of Wales</a> (the future King Edward VIII and later Duke of Windsor) was appointed in 1927 and his younger brothers, <a href="Prince%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester</a>, in 1934 and <a href="George%20VI">Prince Albert, Duke of York</a> (later King George VI), in 1936.

It is likely that these appointments were considered possible because the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> continued to recognise the <a href="British%20monarch">British monarch</a> as its official head of state. In 1937, however, the Irish Free State adopted <a href="Constitution%20of%20Ireland">a new constitution</a>, rendering <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a>'s position in Irish affairs ambiguous. The ambiguity was resolved 12 years later when "<a href="%C3%89ire">Éire</a>" (as the Irish Free State had been renamed in December 1937) formally declared itself <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">a republic</a> and left the <a href="British%20Commonwealth">British Commonwealth</a>, officially leaving in April 1949. The basis for such appointments thus ceased and no further ones have been made.

<a href="His%20Royal%20Highness">HRH</a> <a href="Prince%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">The 1st Duke of Gloucester</a> at his death in 1974 was the last surviving member of the Order. The last living non-Royal member of the Order, <a href="Anthony%20Ashley-Cooper%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Shaftesbury">The 9th Earl of Shaftesbury</a>, died in 1961. The Order has, however, never formally been abolished.

Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> suggested reviving the Order in 1943 to recognise the services of <a href="General%20%28British%20Army%29">General</a> <a href="The%20Honourable">The Hon.</a> <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Sir Harold Alexander</a> in Tunisia, but the opinion of the other <a href="Minister%20of%20the%20Crown">ministers</a> and civil servants was that it would upset the diplomatic balance between London and Dublin. <a href="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a> <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20Lemass">Seán Lemass</a> considered reviving the Order during the 1960s, but did not take a decision.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Ireland">Constitution of Ireland</a> provides, "Titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State" (Article 40.2.1°) and "No title of nobility or of honour may be accepted by any citizen except with the prior approval of the Government" (Article 40.2.2°). Legal experts are divided on whether this clause prohibits the awarding of membership of the Order of St Patrick to <a href="Irish%20citizens">Irish citizens</a>, but some suggest that the phrase "titles of nobility" implies hereditary <a href="peerage">peerage</a>s and other noble titles, not lifetime honours such as <a href="knighthoods">knighthoods</a>.

In recent decades, however, this prohibition has almost never been enforced. Irish citizens who are today offered British honours rarely apply for permission prior to accepting. In practice, it has come to be understood that Irish citizens who receive such awards—including, for example, former <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Ireland">Attorney General</a> <a href="Peter%20Sutherland">Peter Sutherland</a>, rocker/political activist <a href="Bob%20Geldof">Bob Geldof</a>, and the late talk show host <a href="Sir%20Terry%20Wogan">Sir Terry Wogan</a>—do so on a purely honorary basis. They cannot use the honorific '<a href="Sir">Sir</a>' or '<a href="Dame">Dame</a>' unless they subsequently adopt British or Commonwealth nationality (which Wogan did).

The British monarch is the Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland">Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</a>, the monarch's representative in Ireland, served as the Grand Master. The office of <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant">Lord Lieutenant</a> was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was <a href="Edmund%20FitzAlan-Howard%2C%201st%20Viscount%20FitzAlan%20of%20Derwent">The 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent</a>. Initially, the statutes of the Order did not provide that the Grand Master be admitted to the Order as a matter of right. Before this only some Lords Lieutenant were in fact appointed to the Order, this seems to have been the exception rather than the rule. In 1839 Queen Victoria altered this and though not a member during his Grand Mastership, he was permitted to retain the insignia after his term of office.

The Order originally consisted of fifteen knights in addition to the Sovereign. In 1821, however, <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George IV</a> appointed six additional knights; he did not issue a <a href="Warrant%20%28law%29">Royal Warrant</a> authorising the change until 1830. <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">William IV</a> formally changed the statutes in 1833, increasing the limit to twenty-two knights.

The original statutes, based heavily on those of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, prescribed that any vacancy should be filled by the Sovereign upon the nomination of the members. Each Knight was to propose nine candidates, of whom three had to have the rank of <a href="Earl">Earl</a> or higher, three the rank of <a href="Baron">Baron</a> or higher, and three the rank of <a href="Knight">Knight</a> or higher, and a vote taken. In practice this system was never used; the Grand Master would nominate a Peer, the Sovereign would usually assent, and a chapter meeting held at which the knights "elected" the new member. The Order of St Patrick differed from its English and Scottish counterparts, the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Orders of the Garter</a> and the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Thistle">Thistle</a>, in only ever appointing peers and princes. Women were never admitted to the Order of St Patrick; they were not eligible to become members of the other two orders until 1987. The only woman to be part of the Order was <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, in her capacity as Sovereign of the Order. Although it was associated with the established <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> until 1871, several <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholics</a> were appointed to the order throughout its history.

The Order of St Patrick initially had thirteen officers: the Prelate, the Chancellor, the Registrar, the Usher, the Secretary, the Genealogist, the <a href="King%20of%20Arms">King of Arms</a>, two <a href="herald">herald</a>s and four <a href="pursuivant">pursuivant</a>s. Many of these offices were held by clergymen of the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a>, the then-<a href="established%20church">established church</a>. After the disestablishment of the Church in 1871, the ecclesiastics were allowed to remain in office until their deaths, when the offices were either abolished or reassigned to lay officials. All offices except that of Registrar and King of Arms are now vacant.
The office of Prelate was held by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Armagh%20%28Church%20of%20Ireland%29">Lord Archbishop of Armagh</a>, the most senior clergyman in the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a>. The Prelate was not mentioned in the original statutes, but created by a warrant shortly afterwards, apparently because the Archbishop at the time had asked to be appointed to the post. Since the death of the last holder in 1885, the office of Prelate has remained vacant.

The Church of Ireland's second highest cleric, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Dublin%20%28Church%20of%20Ireland%29">Lord Archbishop of Dublin</a>, originally served as the Chancellor of the Order. From 1886 onwards, the office was held instead by the <a href="Chief%20Secretary%20for%20Ireland">Chief Secretary for Ireland</a>. Since the abolition of the position of Chief Secretary in 1922, the office of Chancellor has remained vacant.
The Dean of <a href="St.%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Dublin">St Patrick's Cathedral</a> was originally the Registrar of the Order. In 1890, on the death of the Dean who had held the post in at the time of disestablishment, the office was attached to that of the King of Arms of the Order. This position was held by <a href="Ulster%20King%20of%20Arms">Ulster King of Arms</a>, Ireland's chief heraldic official, a post which had been created in 1552. In 1943, this post was in effect divided in two, reflecting the <a href="partition%20of%20Ireland">partition of Ireland</a> in the <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland%20Act%201920">Government of Ireland Act 1920</a>. The position, insofar as it related to <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, was combined with that of <a href="Norroy%20King%20of%20Arms">Norroy King of Arms</a> (who had heraldic jurisdiction in the north of England). The post of <a href="Norroy%20and%20Ulster%20King%20of%20Arms">Norroy and Ulster King of Arms</a> still exists, and thus continues to hold the offices of Registrar and King of Arms of the Order of St Patrick. The office of <a href="Ulster%20King%20of%20Arms">Ulster King of Arms</a>, insofar as it related to the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> (now officially called Ireland), became the position of <a href="Chief%20Herald%20of%20Ireland">Chief Herald of Ireland</a>.

The Order of St Patrick had six other heraldic officers, many more than any other British order. The two heralds were known as Cork Herald and Dublin Herald. Three of the four pursuivancies were untitled, the fourth was held by <a href="Athlone%20Pursuivant">Athlone Pursuivant</a>, an office founded in 1552.

The Usher of the Order was "the Usher at Arms named the Black Rod". The <a href="Black%20Rod">Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod in Ireland</a> was distinct from the <a href="Black%20Rod">English officer of the same name</a>, though like his counterpart he had some duties in the <a href="Irish%20House%20of%20Lords">Irish House of Lords</a>. (The latter continues to serve as Usher to the Order of the Garter and as Serjeant-at-Arms of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>.) The Irish post has been vacant since 1933.

The offices of Secretary and Genealogist were originally held by members of the <a href="Irish%20House%20of%20Commons">Irish House of Commons</a>. The office of Secretary has been vacant since 1926. The position of Genealogist was left vacant in 1885, restored in 1889, but left vacant again in 1930.

For important occasions, such as <a href="coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">Coronations</a> and investitures of new members of the Order, Knights of St Patrick wore elaborate vestments:

On certain "<a href="collar%20day">collar day</a>s" designated by the Sovereign, members attending formal events wore the Order's collar over their military uniform, formal day dress, or evening wear. When collars were worn (either on collar days or on formal occasions such as coronations), the badge was suspended from the collar.

Aside from these special occasions, however, much simpler accoutrements were used:

The Grand Master's insignia were of the same form and design as those of the Knights. In 1831, however, William IV presented the Grand Master with a star and badge, each composed of <a href="ruby">rubies</a>, <a href="emerald">emerald</a>s and <a href="diamond">Brazilian diamonds</a>. These two insignia were designated "Crown Jewels" in the Order's 1905 Statutes, and the designation "<a href="Irish%20Crown%20Jewels">Irish Crown Jewels</a>" was emphasised by newspapers when they were stolen in 1907, along with the collars of five Knights; they have not since been recovered.

A number of items pertaining to the Order of St Patrick are held in museums in both the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> and <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. The robes of <a href="Luke%20Gerald%20Dillon%2C%204th%20Baron%20Clonbrock">The 4th Baron Clonbrock</a>, the 122nd Knight of the Order, are on display in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Ireland">National Museum of Ireland</a>, Dublin; the robe belonging to <a href="Francis%20Charles%20Needham%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Kilmorey">The 3rd Earl of Kilmorey</a> is held by the <a href="Newry%20Museum">Newry Museum</a>; the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Ireland">National Gallery</a> and <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Ireland">Genealogical Museum</a> in Dublin both have Stars of the Order; and the <a href="Ulster%20Museum">Ulster Museum</a> (part of the <a href="National%20Museums%20and%20Galleries%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland</a>) in <a href="Stranmillis">Stranmillis</a> has a large collection on display and two mantles in storage. The <a href="Irish%20Guards">Irish Guards</a> take their capstar and motto from the Order.

The Chapel of the Order was originally in <a href="St%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Dublin">St Patrick's Cathedral</a> in central <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. Each member of the Order, including the Sovereign, was allotted a stall in the <a href="Cathedral%20diagram">choir</a> of the Chapel, above which his (or her, in the case of <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>) heraldic devices were displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall was a helm, decorated with <a href="mantling">mantling</a> and topped by his crest. Above the crest, the knight's heraldic <a href="banner">banner</a> was hung, emblazoned with his <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a>. At a considerably smaller scale, to the back of the stall was affixed a piece of brass (a "stall plate") displaying its occupant's name, arms and date of admission into the Order. Upon the death of a Knight, the banner and crest were taken down and replaced with those of his successor. After the <a href="Disestablishment%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20Ireland">disestablishment</a> of the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> in 1871, the Chapel ceased to be used; the heraldic devices of the knights at the time were left in place at the request of Queen Victoria.

The Order was without a ceremonial home until 1881 when arrangements were made to display banners, helms and <a href="Achievement%20%28heraldry%29">hatchment</a> plates (the equivalent of stall plates, in the absence of stalls) in the <a href="Great%20Hall">Great Hall</a>, officially called <a href="St.%20Patrick%27s%20Hall%20%28Dublin%29">St. Patrick's Hall</a>, in <a href="Dublin%20Castle">Dublin Castle</a>. On the establishment of the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> the banners of the living knights were removed. When the Hall was redecorated in 1962 it was decided that it should be hung with the banners of the members of the Order in 1922. The existing banners were repaired or new ones made; it is these banners which can be seen today. The Hall, which was renamed St Patrick's Hall from its association with the Order, also served as the Chancery of the Order. Installation ceremonies, and later investitures, were held here, often on <a href="Saint%20Patrick%27s%20Day">St Patrick's Day</a>, until they were discontinued. A banquet for the Knights was often held in the Hall on the occasion of an installation. St Patrick's Hall now serves as the location for the inauguration of the <a href="President%20of%20Ireland">President of Ireland</a>. If an incumbent Irish president dies in office (such as <a href="Erskine%20Hamilton%20Childers">Erskine Hamilton Childers</a> in 1974), he lies in state in the hall.

Unlike many of the other British Orders, the stall plates (or hatchment plates) do not form a continuous record of the Knights of the Order. There are only 34 stall plates for the 80 or so knights appointed before 1871, (although others were destroyed in a fire in 1940), and 40 hatchments plates for the 60 knights appointed subsequently. In the case of the stall plates this was perhaps due to their size, 30x36 cm (12x14 in).

Since the members of the Order were required to be knights, and in practice had higher rank, many of the privileges of membership were rendered moot. As knights they could prefix "Sir" to their forenames, but the form was never used in speech, as they were referred to by their peerage dignities. They were assigned positions in the <a href="Order%20of%20precedence%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">order of precedence</a>, but had higher positions by virtue of their peerage dignities.

Knights used the post-nominal letters "KP". When an individual was entitled to use multiple post-nominal letters, KP appeared before all others, except "Bt" and "Btss" (<a href="Baronet">Baronet</a> and <a href="Baronet">Baronet</a>ess), "VC" (<a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>), "GC" (<a href="George%20Cross">George Cross</a>), "KG" (<a href="Knight%20of%20the%20Garter">Knight of the Garter</a>) and "KT" (<a href="Knight%20of%20the%20Thistle">Knight of the Thistle</a>).

Knights could encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a blue circle bearing the motto) and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar. They were also entitled to receive heraldic <a href="supporters">supporters</a>. This high privilege was, and is, only shared by members of the Royal Family, peers, Knights and Ladies of the Garter, Knights and Ladies of the Thistle, and Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the junior orders. (Of course, Knights of St Patrick, normally all being members of the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">British Royal Family</a> or <a href="Peers%20of%20the%20Realm">peers</a>, were mostly entitled to supporters in any event.)

Tropical Storm Allison

Tropical Storm Allison was a <a href="Tropical%20low">tropical storm</a> that devastated southeast <a href="Texas">Texas</a> in June of the <a href="2001%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2001 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. An arguable example of the "<a href="brown%20ocean%20effect">brown ocean effect</a>", Allison lasted unusually long for a June storm, remaining tropical or <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical</a> for 15 days, most of which when the storm was over land dumping torrential rainfall. The storm developed from a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> in the northern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> on June 4, 2001, and struck the upper Texas coast shortly thereafter. It drifted northward through the state, turned back to the south, and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico. The storm continued to the east-northeast, made landfall on <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, then moved across the southeast United States and <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20States">Mid-Atlantic</a>. Allison was the first storm since <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Frances%20%281998%29">Tropical Storm Frances</a> in 1998 to strike the northern Texas coastline.

The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at over 40 inches (1,000 mm) in Texas. The worst flooding occurred in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, where most of Allison's damage occurred: 30,000 became homeless after the storm flooded over 70,000 houses and destroyed 2,744 homes. Downtown Houston was inundated with flooding, causing severe damage to hospitals and businesses. Twenty-three people died in Texas. Along its entire path, Allison caused $8.5 billion (2001 USD) in damage and 41 deaths. Aside from Texas, the places worst hit were Louisiana and southeastern <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>.

Following the storm, President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> designated 75 counties along Allison's path as disaster areas, which enabled the citizens affected to apply for aid. Then the fourth-costliest Atlantic tropical cyclone and still the costliest Atlantic tropical cyclone that was never a major hurricane, Allison was the first Atlantic tropical storm to have its name <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20names">retired</a> without ever having reached hurricane strength.

A tropical wave moved off the coast of <a href="Africa">Africa</a> on May 21, 2001. It moved westward across the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, retaining little convection on its way. After moving across <a href="South%20America">South America</a> and the southwestern <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, the wave entered the eastern North <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> on June 1. A low-level circulation developed on June 2, while it was about 230 miles (370 km) south-southeast of <a href="Salina%20Cruz">Salina Cruz</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Southerly flow forced the system northward, and the wave moved inland on June 3. The low-level circulation dissipated, though the mid-level circulation persisted. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on June 4, and developed deep convection on its eastern side. Early on June 5, satellite imagery suggested that a tropical depression was forming in the northwest Gulf of Mexico, which was furthered by reports of wind gusts as high as 60 mph (95 km/h) just a few hundred feet above the surface, towards the east side of the system.

At 1200 UTC on June 5, the disturbance developed a broad, low-level circulation, and was classified as Tropical Storm Allison, the first storm of the <a href="2001%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2001 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. Some intensification was projected, though it was expected to be hindered by cool offshore sea surface temperatures. Due to the cold-core nature of the center, Allison initially contained <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical characteristics</a>. Despite this, the storm quickly strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), with tropical storm-force winds extending up to 230 miles (370 km) east of the center, and a minimum central pressure of 1000 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a>. The storm initially moved very little, and the presence of several small vortices from within the deep convection caused difficulty in determining the exact center location. Later in the day, several different track forecasts arose. One scenario had the cyclone tracking westward into Mexico. Another projected the storm moving east towards southern Louisiana. At the time, it was noted that little rain or wind persisted near the center, but rather to the north and east. Under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge that extended in an east–west orientation across the southeast <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, Allison weakened while nearing the Texas coastline, and struck near <a href="Freeport%2C%20Texas">Freeport, Texas</a> with 50 mph (80 km/h) winds. Inland, the storm rapidly weakened, and the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> discontinued advisories early on June 6. Shortly after being downgraded to a tropical depression, surface observations showed an elongated circulation with a poorly defined center, which had reformed closer to the deep convection.
The depression drifted northward until reaching <a href="Lufkin%2C%20Texas">Lufkin, Texas</a>, where it stalled due to a high pressure system to its north. While stalling over Texas, the storm dropped excessive rainfall, peaking at just over 40 inches (1,033 mm) in northwestern <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Texas">Jefferson County</a>. On June 7, the subtropical ridge off <a href="Florida">Florida</a> weakened, while the ridge west of Texas intensified. This steered Tropical Depression Allison to make a clockwise loop, and the storm began drifting to the southwest. As the center reached <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Texas">Huntsville, Texas</a>, a heavy rain band began to back build from Louisiana westward into <a href="Liberty%20County%2C%20Texas">Liberty County, Texas</a>, which had caused additional flooding. At the time, the system had a minimum central pressure of about 1004 mb and maximum sustained winds of about . Late on June 9 and early on June 10, Allison's remnants reentered reached the Gulf of Mexico and emerged over open waters. The low once again became nearly stationary about 60 mi (100 km) south of <a href="Galveston%2C%20Texas">Galveston, Texas</a>, and despite more favorable upper-level winds, it showed no signs of redevelopment. Due to dry air and moderate westerly <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, the storm transformed into a subtropical cyclone. While the subtropical depression moved eastward, a new low level circulation redeveloped to the east, and Allison quickly made landfall on <a href="Morgan%20City%2C%20Louisiana">Morgan City, Louisiana</a> on June 11. At around the same time, the surface center reformed to the east-northeast of its previous location, aligning with the mid-level circulation. Strong <a href="thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a>s redeveloped over the circulation, and Allison strengthened into a subtropical storm over southeastern Louisiana. The storm intensified further to attain sustained winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of about 1000 mb near Mclain, Mississippi, accompanied by a well-defined <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a>-like feature.
The storm was officially downgraded to a subtropical depression at 0000 UTC on June 12. Somewhat accelerating, the depression tracked to the east-northeast through <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, and <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> before becoming nearly stationary near <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>. The depression drifted through North Carolina and sped to the northeast for a time in response to an approaching cold front. Though satellite and radar imagery show the system was well-organized, the system slowed and moved erratically for a period of time, executing what appeared to be a small counterclockwise loop. The storm began tracking in a generally northeasterly direction, and crossed into the southern <a href="Delmarva%20Peninsula">Delmarva Peninsula</a> on June 16. The subtropical remnants reached the Atlantic on June 17, and while located east of <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>, winds began to restrengthen, and heavy rains formed to the north of the circulation. The low was interacting with a <a href="Weather%20front">frontal boundary</a>, and started merging with it, as it accelerated to the northeast at . The remnants of Allison briefly reintensified to a <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical storm</a> through <a href="Baroclinity">baroclinic</a> processes, though it became <a href="Extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> while south of <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. By later on June 17, the low was situated off the coast of <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>, spreading a swath of precipitation over New England. The remnants of the tropical storm were then absorbed by the frontal boundary by June 18, and eventually passed south of <a href="Cape%20Race">Cape Race, Newfoundland</a> on June 20, where the extratropical cyclone dissipated.

Shortly after the storm formed, officials in <a href="Galveston%20County%2C%20Texas">Galveston County, Texas</a> issued a voluntary evacuation for the western end of <a href="Galveston%20Island">Galveston Island</a>, as the area was not protected by the <a href="Galveston%20Seawall">Galveston Seawall</a>. The ferry from the island to the <a href="Bolivar%20Peninsula">Bolivar Peninsula</a> was closed, while voluntary evacuations were issued in <a href="Surfside%20Beach%2C%20Texas">Surfside</a> in <a href="Brazoria%20County%2C%20Texas">Brazoria County</a>. When the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> issued the first advisory on Allison, officials issued <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20watches%20and%20warnings">Tropical Storm Warnings</a> from <a href="Sargent%2C%20Texas">Sargent, Texas</a> to <a href="Morgan%20City%2C%20Louisiana">Morgan City, Louisiana</a>. After the storm made landfall, <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a> watches and warnings were issued for numerous areas in eastern Texas. During the flood event, the National Weather Service in Houston issued 99 flash flood warnings with an average lead time of 40 minutes. With an average lead time of 24 minutes, the National Weather Service in <a href="Lake%20Charles%2C%20Louisiana">Lake Charles, Louisiana</a> issued 47 flash flood warnings. With an average lead time of 39 minutes, the National Weather Service in New Orleans/Baton Rouge issued 87 flash flood warnings, of which 30 were not followed by a flash flood.

In <a href="Tallahassee%2C%20Florida">Tallahassee, Florida</a>, a shelter opened the day before Allison's movement northward through the area, seven staff members housing 12 people. Two other shelters were on standby. Teams informed citizens in the <a href="Florida%20Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a> of flood dangers.

Tropical Storm Allison was a major flood disaster throughout its path from Texas to the Mid-Atlantic. The worst of the flooding occurred in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, Texas, where over 35 inches (890 mm) of rain fell. Allison caused approximately $8.5 billion in damage (2001 USD), making it the costliest tropical cyclone that was never a major hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin. The storm also killed 41 people directly, including 27 who drowned. This ties Allison with a <a href="1917%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season%23Tropical%20Storm%20Two">tropical storm</a> in <a href="1917%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1917</a> as the second-deadliest tropical storm to affect the contiguous United States, surpassed only by the <a href="1925%20Florida%20tropical%20storm">1925 Florida tropical storm</a> which killed 73 people.

Combined with waves on top, areas of Galveston Island experienced a wall of water 8 feet (2.5 m) in height, creating <a href="overwash">overwash</a> along the coastline. The storm caused winds of up to 43 mph (69 km/h) at the Galveston Pier. While Allison was stalling over Texas, it dropped very heavy rainfall across the state. Minimal beach erosion was reported. Flash flooding continued for days, with rainfall amounts across the state peaking at just over 40 inches (1,033 mm) in northwestern <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Texas">Jefferson County</a>. In the <a href="Port%20of%20Houston">Port of Houston</a>, a total of 36.99 inches (940 mm) was reported. Houston experienced torrential rainfall in a short amount of time. The six-day rainfall in Houston amounted to 38.6 inches (980 mm). Houston Hobby Airport received 20.84 inches of rain from June 5 to 10, 2001, while Bush Intercontinental Airport received 16.48 inches. The deluge of rainfall flooded 95,000 automobiles and 73,000 houses throughout Harris County. Tropical Storm Allison destroyed 2,744 homes, leaving 30,000 homeless with residential damages totaling $1.76 billion (2001 USD).

Several hospitals in the <a href="Texas%20Medical%20Center">Texas Medical Center</a>, the largest medical complex in the world, experienced severe damage from the storm, which hit quickly and with unexpected fury on a Friday evening. The <a href="Baylor%20College%20of%20Medicine">Baylor College of Medicine</a> experienced major damage, totaling $495 million (2001 USD, $643 million 2012 USD). The medical school lost 90,000 research animals, 60,000 tumor samples, and 25 years of research data. <a href="The%20University%20of%20Texas%20Health%20Science%20Center%20at%20Houston">The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston</a>, across the street, lost thousands of laboratory animals. Throughout the Medical Center, damage totaled over $2 billion (2001 USD).
The <a href="Houston%20Downtown%20Tunnel%20System">underground tunnel system</a>, which connects most large office buildings in downtown Houston, was submerged, as were many streets and parking garages adjacent to <a href="Buffalo%20Bayou">Buffalo Bayou</a>. At the <a href="Houston%20Theater%20District">Houston Theater District</a>, also in downtown, the Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, and Alley Theater lost millions of dollars of costumes, musical instruments, sheet music, archives and other artifacts. By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground.

Despite massive flooding damage to entire neighborhoods there were no drowning deaths in flooded homes. In the area, there were twelve deaths from driving, six from walking, three from electrocution, and one in an elevator. Elsewhere in Texas, a man drowned when swimming in a ditch in <a href="Mauriceville%2C%20Texas">Mauriceville</a>. Damage totaled $5.2 billion (2001 USD) throughout Texas.

While making its first landfall, Allison's large circulation dropped severe rains on southwest Louisiana. Days later, Allison hit the state as a <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical storm</a>, dropping more heavy rains to the area. Rainfall totals peaked at 29.86 inches (758 mm) in <a href="Thibodaux%2C%20Louisiana">Thibodaux</a>, the highest rainfall total in Louisiana from a tropical cyclone since another <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Allison%20%281989%29">Tropical Storm Allison</a> in 1989. Most of the southeastern portion of the state experienced over 10 inches of rain (255 mm). Winds were generally light, peaking at 38 mph (61 km/h) sustained in <a href="Lakefront%2C%20Louisiana">Lakefront</a> with gusts to 53 mph (85 km/h) in <a href="Bay%20Gardene%2C%20Louisiana">Bay Gardene</a>. The storm produced a storm surge of 2.5 feet (0.75 m) in <a href="Cameron%2C%20Louisiana">Cameron</a> as it was making landfall in Texas. While moving northward through Texas, the outer bands of the storm produced an <a href="Fujita%20scale">F1</a> <a href="tornado">tornado</a> near <a href="Zachary%2C%20Louisiana">Zachary</a>, damaging several trees and a power line. A man was killed when a damaged power line hit his truck.

When Allison first made landfall, heavy rainfall flooded numerous houses and businesses. Minor wind gusts caused minor roof damage to 10 houses in <a href="Cameron%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Cameron Parish</a>, while its storm surge flooded portions of <a href="Louisiana%20Highway%2082">Louisiana Highway 82</a>. When the system returned, more rainfall occurred, flooding over 1,000 houses in <a href="Saint%20Tammany%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">St. Tammany Parish</a>, 80 houses in <a href="Saint%20Bernard%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Saint Bernard Parish</a>, and hundreds of houses elsewhere in the state. The flooding also forced 1,800 residents from their homes in <a href="East%20Baton%20Rouge%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">East Baton Rouge Parish</a>. The deluge left numerous roads impassable, while runoff resulted in severe river flooding. The <a href="Bogue%20Falaya%20River">Bogue Falaya River</a> in <a href="Covington%2C%20Louisiana">Covington</a> crested past its peak twice to near-record levels. The <a href="Amite%20River">Amite</a> and <a href="Comite%20River">Comite River</a>s reached their highest levels since 1983. In addition, the levee along the <a href="Bayou%20Manchac">Bayou Manchac</a> broke, flooding roadways and more houses. Damage in Louisiana totaled to $65 million (2001 USD, $84 million 2012 USD).

In <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, Allison produced heavy rainfall of over 10 inches (255 mm) in one night, while some areas in the southwestern portion of the state received over 15 inches (380 mm). The flooding damaged numerous houses and flooded many roadways. Thunderstorms from the storm produced four tornadoes, including one in <a href="Gulfport%2C%20Mississippi">Gulfport, Mississippi</a> that damaged 10 houses. Severe thunderstorms in <a href="George%20County%2C%20Mississippi">George County</a> damaged 15 houses, destroyed 10, and injured 5 people. Damage in Mississippi totaled to over $1 million (2001 USD, $1.3 million 2012 USD). Rainfall in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> was moderate, with areas near <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a> experiencing more than 10 inches (255 mm). Heavy rainfall closed several roads in <a href="Crenshaw%20County%2C%20Alabama">Crenshaw County</a>. The storm, combined with a high pressure, produced coastal flooding in southern Alabama. Allison produced an <a href="Fujita%20scale">F0</a> tornado in southwest <a href="Mobile%20County%2C%20Alabama">Mobile County</a> that caused minor roof damage and another F0 tornado in <a href="Covington%20County%2C%20Alabama">Covington County</a> that caused minor damage to six homes and a church.

The storm, combined with a high pressure system, produced a strong pressure gradient, resulting in strong rip currents off the coast of <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. The currents prompted sirens, which are normally used for storm warnings, to be activated in <a href="Pensacola%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Pensacola Beach</a>. The rip currents killed 5 off the coast of Florida. Outer rain bands from the storm dropped heavy rainfall across the <a href="Florida%20Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a> of over 11 inches (280 mm) in one day. The <a href="Tallahassee%20Regional%20Airport">Tallahassee Regional Airport</a> recorded 10.13 inches (257 mm) in 24 hours, breaking the old 24‑hour record set in 1969. Throughout the state, Allison destroyed 10 homes and damaged 599, 196 severely, primarily in <a href="Leon%20County%2C%20Florida">Leon County</a>. Including the deaths from rip currents, Allison killed eight people in Florida and caused $20 million (2001 USD, $26 million 2012 USD) in damage.

Over <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, the storm dropped heavy rainfall of 10 inches (255 mm) in 24 hours in various locations. The deluge caused rivers to crest past their banks, including the <a href="Oconee%20River">Oconee River</a> at <a href="Milledgeville%2C%20Georgia">Milledgeville</a> which peaked at 33.7 feet (10.3 m). The rainfall, which was heaviest across the southwestern portion of the state, washed out several bridges and roads, and flooded many other roads. Georgia governor <a href="Roy%20Barnes">Roy Barnes</a> declared a state of emergency for seven counties in the state. The storm also spawned two tornadoes. In <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, Allison's outer bands produced 10 <a href="tornado">tornado</a>es and several funnel clouds, though most only caused minor damage limited to a damaged courthouse, snapped trees and downed power lines. Allison produced from 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm) of rainfall in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, closing nearly all roads in <a href="Martin%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Martin County</a> and damaging 25 homes. The severe flooding washed out a bridge in eastern <a href="Halifax%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Halifax County</a> and flooded numerous cars. Wet roads caused nine traffic accidents throughout the state.

In <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, Allison produced light rainfall, with the southeastern and south-central portions of the state experiencing over 3 inches (76 mm). A tree in a saturated ground fell over and killed one person.

The rainfall caused drainage and traffic problems. Damage in Massachusetts totaled to $400,000 (2001 USD, $520,000 2012 USD).

Within weeks of the disaster, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> declared 75 counties in Texas, southern <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, southern <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, northwestern <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, and southeastern Pennsylvania as disaster areas. The declarations allowed affected citizens to receive aid for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, and other serious disaster-related expenses. The <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) also provided 75% for the cost of debris removal, emergency services related to the disaster, and repairing or replacing damaged public facilities, such as roads, bridges and utilities.
A few weeks after Allison, FEMA opened six disaster recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a> and the <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> opened 48 shelters at the peak of need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000 meals. The <a href="National%20Disaster%20Medical%20System">National Disaster Medical System</a> deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500 people. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses. After nearly 50,000 cars were flooded and ruined, many people attempted to sell the cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a> outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. By six months after the storm, around 120,000 Texas citizens applied for federal disaster aid, totaling to $1.05 billion (2001 USD).

Like in Texas, a mosquito outbreak occurred in Louisiana. Only pesticides acceptable to the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">US Environmental Protection Agency</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">US Fish and Wildlife Service</a> were allowed to be used. FEMA officials warned homeowners of the dangers of floodwaters, including mold, mildew, and bacteria. By three months after the storm, just under 100,000 Louisiana citizens applied for federal aid, totaling to over $110 million (2001 USD, $143 million 2012 USD). $25 million (2001 USD, $32 million 2012 USD) of the total was for business loans, while an additional $8 million was for public assistance for communities and state agencies. More than 750 flood victims in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> applied for governmental aid, totaling to $1.29 million (2001 USD, $1.5 million 2007 USD). In Pennsylvania, 1,670 flood victims applied for federal aid, totaling to $11.5 million (2001 USD, $14.3 million 2012 USD). $3.4 million (2001 USD, $4.4 million 2012 USD) of the total was to replace a <a href="Southeastern%20Pennsylvania%20Transportation%20Authority">SEPTA</a> rail bridge over <a href="Sandy%20Run%20%28Wissahickon%20Creek%29">Sandy Run</a> in <a href="Fort%20Washington%2C%20Pennsylvania">Fort Washington</a>.

Due to the severe damage and deaths caused by the storm, the name Allison was retired in spring 2002, and will never again be used in the <a href="Atlantic%20basin">Atlantic basin</a>; the 2001 incarnation of Allison was the only Atlantic tropical system to have its name retired without reaching hurricane strength until the name "Erika" was retired following a <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Erika">storm in 2015</a>. The name was replaced with <a href="Subtropical%20Storm%20Andrea%20%282007%29">Andrea</a> in the <a href="2007%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">2007 season</a>.

Its colourful golden <a href="Crest%20%28feathers%29">crest</a> feathers gives rise to its English and scientific names, and possibly to it being called the "king of the birds" in European folklore. The scientific name, "R. regulus", means king or knight. Several subspecies are recognised across the very large distribution range that includes much of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and the islands of <a href="Macaronesia">Macaronesia</a> and <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>. Birds from the north and east of its breeding range <a href="bird%20migration">migrate</a> to winter further south.

This kinglet has greenish upper-parts, whitish under-parts, and has two white wingbars. It has a plain face contrasting black irises and a bright head crest, orange and yellow in the male and yellow in the female, which is <a href="display%20%28zoology%29">displayed</a> during breeding. It superficially resembles the <a href="common%20firecrest">common firecrest</a>, which largely shares its European range, but the latter's bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive. The <a href="Bird%20vocalization">song</a> is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly higher-pitched than those of its relative. Birds on the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> are now separated into two subspecies of the goldcrest, but were formerly considered to be a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the firecrest or a separate species, "Regulus teneriffae".

The goldcrest breeds in <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> woodland and gardens, building its compact, three-layered nest on a tree branch. Ten to twelve <a href="Bird%20egg">eggs</a> are <a href="Egg%20incubation%23Avian%20incubation">incubated</a> by the female alone, and the chicks are fed by both parents; second broods are common. This kinglet is constantly on the move as it searches for <a href="Insectivore">insects to eat</a>, and in winter it is often found with flocks of <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">tits</a>. It may be killed by <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> or carry <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s, but its large range and population mean that it is not considered to present any significant conservation concerns.

The goldcrest is the smallest European bird, in length, with a wingspan and a weight of . It is similar in appearance to a <a href="warbler">warbler</a>, with olive-green upper-parts, buff-white underparts, two white wing bars, and a plain face with conspicuous black <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a>. The crown of the head has black sides and a narrow black front, and a bright crest, yellow with an orange centre in the male, and entirely yellow in the female; the crest is erected in display, making the distinctive orange stripe of the male much more conspicuous. The small, thin bill is black, and the legs are dark flesh-brown. Apart from the crest colour, the sexes are alike, although in fresh plumage, the female may have very slightly paler upper-parts and greyer underparts than the adult male. The juvenile is similar to the adult, but has duller upper-parts and lacks the coloured crown. Although the tail and <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s may be retained into the first winter, by then the young birds are almost indistinguishable from adults in the field. The flight is distinctive; it consists of whirring wing-beats with occasional sudden changes of direction. Shorter flights while feeding are a mix of dashing and fluttering with frequent hovering. It moves restlessly among foliage, regularly creeping on branches and up and down trunks.

The goldcrest is usually easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion with the <a href="common%20firecrest">common firecrest</a> or <a href="yellow-browed%20warbler">yellow-browed warbler</a>. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The <a href="ruby-crowned%20kinglet">ruby-crowned kinglet</a>, an American "Regulus" species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could be more difficult to distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.

The typical <a href="Bird%20vocalization">contact call</a> of the goldcrest is a thin, high-pitched "zee" given at intervals of 1–4 seconds, with all the notes at the same pitch. It sometimes has a more clipped ending, or is delivered more rapidly. The call is higher and less rough than that of the firecrest. The song of the male goldcrest is a very high, thin double note "cedar", repeated 5–7 times and ending in a flourish, "cedarcedar-cedar-cedar-cedar-stichi-see-pee". The entire song lasts 3–4 seconds and is repeated 5–7 times a minute. This song, often uttered while the male is foraging, can be heard in most months of the year. There is also a subdued rambling subsong. Male goldcrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common firecrest, but the reverse is apparently not true, since the songs of the common firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.

The songs of mainland goldcrests vary only slightly across their range and consist of a single song type, but much more divergence has occurred in the isolated <a href="Macaronesia">Macaronesia</a>n populations. Not only are there variations between islands and within an island, but individual males on the Azores can have up to three song types. The dialects on the Azores fall into two main groups, neither of which elicited a response from male European goldcrests in playback experiments. There are also two main dialect groups on the Canary islands, a widespread group similar to the European version, and another that is restricted to the mountains of Tenerife. The song variations have been used to investigate the colonisation pattern of the Macaronesian islands by goldcrests, and identified a previously unknown subspecies.

The kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in the <a href="Old%20World%20warbler">Old World warbler</a>s, but frequently given family status, especially as recent research shows that despite superficial similarities, they are <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetically</a> remote from the warblers. The names of the family, Regulidae, and its only genus, "Regulus", are derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> , a diminutive of , a king. The goldcrest was first described by <a href="Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his in 1758 as "Motacilla regulus" (characterised as ). It was moved to the warbler genus "<a href="typical%20warbler">Sylvia</a>" by English <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in 1790, and to its current genus by French <a href="zoology">zoologist</a> <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> in 1800.

The relationships of the <a href="flamecrest">flamecrest</a> or Taiwan firecrest ("Regulus goodfellowi") of Taiwan have also been a source of much debate. It is sometimes viewed as a race of firecrest, but its territorial song resembles those of the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayan</a> races of goldcrest, and genetic data show that it is the closest relative of that species, and, despite its alternative name, only distantly related to the firecrest. The flamecrest diverged from the goldcrest 3.0–3.1 <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a> (million years ago).

Several subspecies of the goldcrest have been described. In continental <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, there are nine generally accepted and very similar subspecies, differing only in details such as plumage shade. At the genetic level, the two Central Asian forms, "R. r. sikkimensis" and "R. r. himalayensis", are very close to each other, and have differentiated only in the recent past, but they diverged from the western subspecies around 2.8 mya.

Two groups of goldcrest <a href="taxa">taxa</a> are found on the Atlantic islands of <a href="Macaronesia">Macaronesia</a>. Birds on the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> are ancient colonists, whereas those on <a href="The%20Azores">The Azores</a> are of more recent origin. There are no goldcrests on <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>, where the <a href="Madeira%20firecrest">Madeira firecrest</a> is the only "Regulus" species.

The Canary Islands were colonised in two waves. The first step was the occupation of <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a> and <a href="La%20Gomera">La Gomera</a> 1.9–2.3 million years ago, followed by a separate invasion of <a href="El%20Hierro">El Hierro</a> and <a href="La%20Palma">La Palma</a> 1.3–1.8 mya.

Birds from the Canary Islands are particularly distinctive having a black forehead, pink-buff underparts and a darker closed wing, and have been sometimes treated either as a subspecies of the common firecrest or as a different "Regulus" species altogether. They were sometimes called the Tenerife goldcrest, no matter which of the islands they lived on; however, a 2006 study of the vocalisations of these birds indicate that they actually comprise two subspecies of the goldcrest that are separable on voice; "R. r. teneriffae" occurring on Tenerife and the newly described subspecies, "R. r. ellenthalerae", the western Canary Islands goldcrest, occurring on the smaller islands of La Palma and El Hierro. 

Differences in songs, genetics and <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> suggests that the Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, about 100,000 years ago. It is likely that the initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western <a href="caldera">caldera</a> of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island">São Miguel</a>, where both eastern and western song types are found.

There are a few Pleistocene (2.6 million to 12,000 years <a href="Before%20Present">BP</a>) records from Europe of extant "Regulus" species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species. The only fossil of an extinct "Regulus" is a left <a href="ulna">ulna</a> from 2.6–1.95 mya in Bulgaria, which was identified as belonging to an extinct species, "<a href="Regulus%20bulgaricus">Regulus bulgaricus</a>". The goldcrest lineage diverged from this apparent ancestor of the common firecrest in the Middle Pleistocene.

The goldcrest breeds in mature lowland and mountain <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> woodlands, mainly up to , and occasionally to . It uses <a href="spruce">spruce</a>, <a href="larch">larch</a>, <a href="Scots%20pine">Scots pine</a>, <a href="Abies%20alba">silver fir</a> and <a href="mountain%20pine">mountain pine</a>, and in man-made landscapes also introduced conifers such as <a href="douglas%20fir">douglas fir</a>. Breeding densities of up to 591 pairs per square km (1,530 pairs per square mile) have been recorded in <a href="Picea%20abies">Norway spruce</a> in Ireland, and goldcrests constituted over 60% of all birds found in Welsh Douglas fir and Norway spruce plantations. <a href="Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forests">Broad-leaved woods</a> are used only when some spruce or firs are also present. Sites such as parks and cemeteries are used only when they offer suitable conifers that are not otherwise locally available. The height and nature of any undergrowth is irrelevant. Unlike more specialised birds such as the <a href="Eurasian%20nuthatch">Eurasian nuthatch</a> and the <a href="Eurasian%20treecreeper">Eurasian treecreeper</a>, both of which forage on tree trunks, the kinglets do not need large woodlands, and their population density is independent of forest size. Once breeding is over, this species will readily move into deciduous trees and shrubs, <a href="heathland">heathland</a> and similar more open habitats.

The Tenerife subspecies occurs in the mountain region previously occupied by <a href="laurisilva">laurisilva</a>, but now dominated by <a href="tree%20heath">tree heath</a>s. It is common only in that habitat, becoming rare in pine forest, where it occurs only where tree-heath is also available.

The goldcrest has a huge range in Eurasia, breeding from Macaronesia to Japan. It is common in middle and northern <a href="temperate">temperate</a> and <a href="Boreal%20ecosystem">boreal</a> latitudes of Europe, between the July <a href="contour%20line">isotherms</a>, and thus predominantly in cooler climates than the firecrest. Further east it occurs discontinuously through southern <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> to <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a> and Japan, in the <a href="Tian%20Shan">Tian Shan</a> mountains, northern Iran, and from the Himalayas east to central China.

This species has bred in Iceland since about 1999, and was widespread by 2004, although numbers are affected by hard winters. Breeds occurs intermittently in the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroes</a>. The goldcrest has occurred as a <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> in Jordan and Morocco.
This species is partly <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, northernmost populations deserting their breeding areas in winter. Birds winter in Europe and Asia south of the breeding range. Birds in northern <a href="Fennoscandia">Fennoscandia</a> and Russia vacate their territories between late August and early November, with most leaving in late September to mid-October as the first cold weather arrives. Adverse conditions may lead to disorientation, large numbers gathering on ships on overcast or wet nights. Large influxes include 15,000 birds on the <a href="Isle%20of%20May">Isle of May</a> in October 1982, and nearly 21,000 birds through a single site in Latvia during September and October 1983. Spring migration is complete by late March on the Mediterranean islands, but continues to late April or early May in northern Europe. The spring passage is much lighter than in autumn, suggesting high mortality on migration.

A study in the Baltic region showed that northern goldcrests were more likely to migrate, and increased their body mass beforehand; non-migratory southern birds did not increase their fat reserves. The travel speed of migrating goldcrests increased for those leaving later in the autumn, and was greater for the northernmost populations. Migration was faster on routes that crossed the Baltic Sea than on coastal routes, and the birds with the largest fat reserves travelled at the highest speeds. The ability to lay down fat is adversely affected in this tiny bird by poor health. In Hungary, goldcrests stopping temporarily on migration were mostly found in <a href="Shrubland">scrub</a>, including <a href="Prunus%20spinosa">blackthorn</a>, <a href="Crataegus%20monogyna">hawthorn</a> and <a href="European%20pear">pear</a>, which provided some protection from <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">sparrowhawks</a>. Females migrated slightly earlier than males, but overall there were more males, with an average sex ratio of 1.6:1. Goldcrests can fly in one day, although they keep at a lower level in heavy <a href="headwind">headwind</a>s. This is a tame and inquisitive bird, and tired migrants will land near or on humans, sometimes searching for food on their clothing.

The <a href="North%20Atlantic%20oscillation">North Atlantic oscillation</a> is an atmospheric phenomenon affecting the weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.

The goldcrest is <a href="monogamous">monogamous</a>. The male sings during the breeding season, usually while foraging rather than from a perch. It has a <a href="display%20%28zoology%29">display</a> involving bowing its head towards another bird and raising the coloured crest. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two species learned to ignore each other's songs. However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the goldcrest and the firecrest to share territories; either one or the other is present, but not both. A male goldcrest will defend his territory against either species, sometimes including some firecrest phrases in his song.

The goldcrest's <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a> is a well-insulated cup-shaped structure built in three layers. The nest's outer layer is made from moss, small twigs, cobwebs and lichen, the cobwebs also being used to attach the nest to the thin branches that support it. The middle layer is moss, which is lined by an inner layer of feathers and hair. The nest is larger, shallower and less compact than that of the firecrest, with an internal diameter of about , and is constructed by both sexes, although the female does most of the work. It is often suspended from a hanging branch, usually at no great height, although <a href="Eric%20Simms%20%28ornithologist%29">Eric Simms</a> reported nests at heights from . One pair built their nest just above that of a sparrowhawk.
Laying starts at the end of April into early May. The eggs are whitish with very indistinct buff, grey or brown markings at the broad end. The eggs are and weigh , of which 5% is shell. The <a href="avian%20clutch%20size">clutch size</a> in Europe is typically 9–11 eggs, but ranges from 6–13. The eggs are piled up in the nest and the female keeps the eggs warm with her <a href="brood%20patch">brood patch</a> and also by putting her warm legs into the middle of the pile between the eggs. Within a clutch the size of eggs increases gradually and the last laid egg may be 20% larger than the first egg. Second <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutches</a>, which are common, are laid usually while the first nest still has young. The male builds the second nest, then feeds the young in the first nest while the female is incubating in the second; when the first brood has fledged, he joins the female in feeding the second brood. The female goldcrest is not normally fed by her mate while incubating. She is a tight sitter, reluctant to leave the nest when disturbed, and has been recorded as continuing to attend the nest when it has been moved, or even when it is being held. The eggs are maintained at , the female regulating the temperature of the eggs by varying the time spent sitting. She leaves the nest more with increasing air temperature, and incubates more tightly when the light intensity is lower early and late in the day. The female incubates the eggs for 16 to 19 days to hatching, and broods the chicks, which <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in a further 17 to 22 days later. Both parents feed the chicks and fledged young, and in very hot weather, the female has been noted as taking drops of water to her chicks in her bill. This species becomes sexually mature after one year, and has an annual adult mortality of over 80 percent giving a life expectancy of around eight months, which is the shortest for any bird apart from a few "<a href="Coturnix">Coturnix</a>" species. There are nonetheless records of an individual surviving to 4 years 10 months, and even a report of a bird ringed in Winchester in 1989 and found dead in Morocco 7 years and 7 months later.

Although their ranges overlap substantially, <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridisation</a> between goldcrests and firecrests seems to be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, and appeared to be poorly adapted compared to the parent species.

All "Regulus" species are almost exclusively <a href="insectivorous">insectivorous</a>, preying on small <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s with soft <a href="cuticle">cuticle</a>s, such as <a href="springtail">springtail</a>s, <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s and spiders. They also feed on the <a href="Pupa%23Cocoon">cocoons</a> and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, there are a number of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large <a href="orb-web%20spider">orb-web spider</a>s (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).

The goldcrest takes a wide variety of prey, especially spiders, <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s, <a href="Hemiptera">bugs</a>, springtails and <a href="flies">flies</a>. Larger prey such as <a href="oak%20bush%20cricket">oak bush cricket</a>s and <a href="tortrix%20moths">tortrix moths</a> may sometimes be taken. Flying insects are taken in hovering flight but not normally pursued; there is a record of a goldcrest attacking a large dragonfly in flight, only to be dragged along by the insect before releasing it unharmed. Goldcrests will occasionally feed on the ground among leaf-litter with <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">tits</a>. Non-animal food is rare, although goldcrests have been seen drinking <a href="sap">sap</a> from broken <a href="birch">birch</a> twigs together with tits and nuthatches.

The goldcrest feeds in trees, frequently foraging on the undersides of branches and leaves. This is in contrast to the common firecrest, which mainly exploits the upper surface of branches in coniferous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees. In winter, flocks of goldcrests cover a given distance at only one-third of the speed of common firecrests, taking the smallest prey items ignored by their relative. The differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences; firecrests have broader bills with longer <a href="rictal%20bristle">rictal bristle</a>s (which protect a bird's eye from food items it is trying to capture), and these features reflect the larger prey taken by the species. The firecrest's less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting. Firecrests forage more often while on foot, and have a foot better adapted for perching, whereas the goldcrest's longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding. It also has deep furrows in the soles of its feet capable of gripping individual needles, while firecrests have a smoother surface. The goldcrest has much the same range and habitat preference as the <a href="common%20chiffchaff">common chiffchaff</a>, and there is some evidence that high breeding densities of the kinglet depress the population of the warbler, although the converse is not true. There is no evidence that the species compete for territories, and in any case the chiffchaff is 50% heavier than the goldcrest. Nevertheless, there are 1.5 million breeding pairs of goldcrests in Finland, compared with 0.4 million breeding pairs of chiffchaffs, and only the kinglet has increased in numbers as the area of spruce woodland in the country has expanded. The goldcrest may be out-competing the warbler for food, especially as the larger bird faces more competition from other insectivores, including other "<a href="Phylloscopus">Phylloscopus</a>" warblers. Both birds occur in similar forests, but the chiffchaff is found within of the forest edge, with the goldcrest breeding deeper in the woodland. Nevertheless, there is no conclusive evidence that the decline of the chiffchaff subspecies "Phylloscopus collybita abietinus" in parts of Finland is due to competition with the <a href="willow%20warbler">willow warbler</a> and goldcrest.

Outside the breeding season, small groups of goldcrests maintain exclusive winter feeding territories, which they defend against neighbouring groups. As they roam around their territory, they frequently join loose flocks of other wanderers such as <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">tits</a> and warblers. This kinglet, like other species that prefer <a href="mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species foraging flock</a>s in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds. A consequence of feeding in a flock is that foraging sites may be restricted to avoid competition with other species. In a Swedish study, <a href="coal%20tit">coal tit</a>s and goldcrests foraged in the outer foliage, while the larger <a href="willow%20tit">willow</a> and <a href="European%20crested%20tit">European crested tit</a>s used the inner canopy. In sites where the numbers of willow and crested tits was artificially reduced, goldcrests and coal tits extended their foraging to include the inner canopy, but did not do so where the larger tits were retained. In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables to take fat, sometimes with warblers such as the <a href="common%20chiffchaff">common chiffchaff</a> and <a href="blackcap">blackcap</a>.

Several small passerine species survive freezing winter nights by inducing a lower <a href="metabolic%20rate">metabolic rate</a> and <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>, of a maximum of below normal body temperature, in order to reduce energy consumption overnight. However, in freezing conditions, it may be that for very small birds, including the tiny goldcrest, the energy economies of induced hypothermia may be insufficient to counterbalance the negative effects of hypothermia including the energy required to raise body temperature back to normal at dawn. Observations of five well-fed birds suggest that they maintain normal body temperatures during cold nights by metabolising fat laid down during the day, and that they actually use behavioural <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a> strategies, such as collective roosting in dense foliage or snow holes to survive winter nights. Two birds roosting together reduce their heat loss by a quarter, and three birds by a third. During an 18‑hour winter night, with temperatures as low as in the north of its range, goldcrests huddled together can each burn off fat equivalent to 20% of body weight to keep warm.

Migrating birds rely largely on stored fat and they also metabolise protein as a supplementary source of energy. Those with a relatively large amount of fat, may make stops during migration of only 1–2 days; although they have lost weight since commencing their journey, they have enough energy reserves to reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males increases as they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore lower than that of the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.

Throughout the goldcrest's range, the main predator of small woodland birds is the <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a>, which has a diet consisting of up to 98% of birds. <a href="Merlin%20%28bird%29">Merlins</a>, <a href="tawny%20owl">tawny</a> and <a href="long-eared%20owl">long-eared owl</a>s also hunt goldcrests. The erratic movements and flights of small woodland birds, which are vulnerable to attack while away from cover, may help to confuse their predators. The goldcrest has only very rarely been recorded as a host of the <a href="common%20cuckoo">common cuckoo</a>, a widespread European <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>.

The goldcrest is a host of the widespread <a href="moorhen%20flea">moorhen flea</a>, "Dasypsyllus gallinulae", and of the <a href="louse">louse</a> "Philopterus reguli". The <a href="amblycerous">amblycerous</a> mite "<a href="Ricinus%20frenatus">Ricinus frenatus</a>" has been found on the eastern goldcrest subspecies, "R. r. japonensis" in Japan, and at the other end of the range in birds of the nominate subspecies on the <a href="Faroes">Faroes</a> and in Spain. These lice move over the host's body, and have strong mouthparts that pierce the host's skin so that they can feed on blood, and sometimes feather material. A number of <a href="feather%20mite">feather mite</a>s have been recorded in the genus "Regulus"; these mites live on fungi growing on the feathers. The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the <a href="keratin">keratin</a> of the outer feathers or on feather oil.

The goldcrest has a large range, estimated at 13.2 million km (5.1 million mi) and a total population estimated at 80–200 million individuals, and it is therefore classed as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. There was some northward range expansion in Scotland, Belgium, Norway, and Finland during the 20th century, assisted by the spread of conifer plantations. The population is currently stable, although there may be temporary marked declines in harsh winters.

Although dense conifer growth can provide shelter for roosting at night, losses in hard winters can be heavy. In a Finnish study, only one-tenth of the wintering goldcrest population, which mainly fed on spiders, survived to spring. Each group roamed within a defined winter territory, and their winter survival depended on the density of the food supply. For these northern birds there is a trade off between staying put and risking starvation, or facing the perils of migration. Even in somewhat milder regions, where over-wintering is normal, exceptionally cold winters can cause such heavy losses that breeding populations take several years to recover. In 1930, the English ornithologist <a href="Thomas%20Coward">Thomas Coward</a> wrote:

Until the severe winter of 1916–17 the Goldcrest was abundant and widespread, nesting in all the wooded portions of our islands; in 1920 it could have little more than an obituary notice, for the nesting stock was practically "wiped out. " ... and for some years, even as a winter visitor, the Goldcrest remained rare, absent from most of its nesting haunts. It is, however, now fully re-established.

Conversely, populations can expand rapidly after a series of mild winters. In lowland Britain, there was an increase of 48% following the 1970/71 winter, with many pairs spreading into deciduous woodlands where they would not normally breed.

<a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> (384–322 BC) and <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a> (23–79 AD) both wrote about the legend of a contest among the birds to see who should be their king, the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest. Initially, it looked as though the eagle would win easily, but as he began to tire, a small bird that had hidden under the eagle's tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title. Following from this legend, in much European folklore the <a href="Eurasian%20wren">wren</a> has been described as the "king of the birds" or as a flame bearer. However, these terms were also applied to the "Regulus" species, the fiery crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles, and, because of the legend's reference to the "smallest of birds" becoming king, the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny wren. The confusion was probably compounded by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the Greek words for the wren ( , "king") and the crests ( , "kinglet"). In English, the association between the goldcrest and Eurasian wren may have been reinforced by the kinglet's old name of "gold-crested wren".

This tiny woodland bird has had little other impact on literature, although it is the subject of <a href="Charles%20Tennyson%20Turner">Charles Tennyson Turner</a>'s short poem, "The Gold-crested Wren", first published in 1868. An old English name for the goldcrest is the "woodcock pilot", since migrating birds preceded the arrival of <a href="Eurasian%20woodcock">Eurasian woodcock</a>s by a couple of days. There are unfounded legends that the goldcrest would hitch a ride in the feathers of the larger bird, and similar stories claimed that <a href="owl">owl</a>s provided the transport. Suffolk fishermen called this bird "herring spink" or "tot o'er seas" because migrating goldcrests often landed on the rigging of herring boats out in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>.

Common firecrest

The common firecrest ("Regulus ignicapilla") also known as the firecrest, is a very small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird in the <a href="kinglet">kinglet</a> family. It breeds in most of <a href="Temperateness">temperate</a> Europe and northwestern Africa, and is partially <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, with birds from central Europe wintering to the south and west of their breeding range. Firecrests in the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a> and north Africa are widely recognised as a separate <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, but the population on <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>, previously also treated as a subspecies, is now treated as a distinct species, the <a href="Madeira%20firecrest">Madeira firecrest</a>, "Regulus madeirensis". A fossil ancestor of the firecrest has been identified from a single wing bone.

This kinglet is greenish above and has whitish underparts. It has two white wingbars, a black eye stripe and a white <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a>. The head crest, orange in the male and yellow in the female, is <a href="display%20%28zoology%29">displayed</a> during breeding, and gives rise to the English and scientific names for the species. This bird superficially resembles the <a href="goldcrest">goldcrest</a>, which largely shares its European range, but the firecrest's bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive. The <a href="Bird%20vocalization">song</a> is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly lower-pitched than those of its relative.

The common firecrest breeds in <a href="Flowering%20plant">broadleaved</a> or <a href="pinophyta">coniferous</a> woodland and gardens, building its compact, three-layered nest on a tree branch. Seven to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone. Both parents feed the chicks, which <a href="fledge">fledge</a> 22–24 days after hatching. This kinglet is constantly on the move and frequently hovers as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">tits</a>. Despite some possible local declines, the species is not the subject of significant conservation concerns owing to its large European population and an expansion of its range over the last century. It may be hunted and killed by <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, and can carry parasites. It is possible that this species was the original "king of the birds" in European folklore.

The common firecrest is a small plump bird, in length with a wingspan of , and weighs . It has bright olive-green upperparts with a bronze-coloured patch on each shoulder, and whitish underparts washed with brownish-grey on the breast and flanks. It has two white wingbars, a tiny black pointed bill, and brownish-black legs. The head pattern is striking, with a black eye stripe, long white <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a>, and a crest which is bright yellow in the female and mainly orange in the male. The sexes are very similar, apart from the crest colour, although the female is a little duller in <a href="plumage">plumage</a> and on average slightly smaller. Juveniles have a grey tinge to the duller upperparts, and lack the coloured crown; the other head markings are present, but duller than in the adult. By their first winter, only the <a href="flight%20feather">flight</a> and tail feathers remain <a href="moulting">unmoulted</a>, and the young birds are virtually indistinguishable from the adults in the field. This kinglet usually hops with its body held horizontally, and its flight is weak and whirring, with occasional quick evasive turns.

Adult firecrests are unlikely to be confused with any other species; <a href="Pallas%27s%20warbler">Pallas's warbler</a> has a similar head and wing pattern, but its crown stripe is pale lemon, not bright yellow or orange, and its supercilium is also pale yellow, not bright white. The juvenile common firecrest might be confused with the goldcrest, but usually shows enough face pattern to distinguish it from its relative, which has a very plain face at all ages. The firecrest can also be separated from Pallas's warbler by the warbler's pale crown stripe and yellow rump. There is more likelihood of confusing the juvenile firecrest with the <a href="yellow-browed%20warbler">yellow-browed warbler</a>, which has a similar head pattern; the warbler (an Asiatic species) has pale fringes to the feathers of the closed wing, a whitish belly and darker brown legs. The yellow-browed warbler also lacks the pale half circle present below the young firecrest's eye.

The kinglets are a small group of birds sometimes included in the <a href="Old%20World%20warbler">Old World warbler</a>s, but frequently given family status, especially as recent research shows that, despite superficial similarities, the crests are <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a>ally remote from the warblers. The names of the family, <a href="Regulidae">Regulidae</a>, and its only genus, "<a href="kinglet">Regulus</a>", are derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "regulus", a diminutive of "rex", "a king", and refer to the characteristic orange or yellow crests of adult kinglets. The common firecrest was first formally <a href="species%20description">described</a> by Dutch zoologist <a href="Coenraad%20Jacob%20Temminck">Coenraad Jacob Temminck</a> in 1820 as "Sylvia ignicapilla"; the relatively late identification of this common European bird arose from a perception that it was just a variety of the goldcrest. The species name is derived from Latin "ignis" "fire" and "capillus" "hair". The binomial is frequently given as "R. ignicapillus" due to a misunderstanding of Latin grammar.

There are two widely recognised subspecies of common firecrest, nominate "R. i. ignicapilla" and Mediterranean "R. i. balearicus" (Jordans, 1923). The latter form is found on the Balearic Islands and in north Africa, and is slightly paler below and greyer above than the nominate subspecies. Other subspecies have been claimed, including southeastern "R. i. caucasicus", North African "R. i. laeneni", and <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a>n "R. i. tauricus". The <a href="Madeira%20firecrest">Madeira firecrest</a>, "R. madeirensis", was formerly also considered to be a subspecies of the common firecrest, but <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> analysis based on the <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b" gene</a> showed that the Madeiran form is distinct at the species level. Cytochrome "b" gene divergence between the Madeira firecrest and the European bird is 8.5%, comparable with the divergence level between other recognised "Regulus" species, such as the 9% between the goldcrest and the <a href="golden-crowned%20kinglet">golden-crowned kinglet</a>. The island form also differs in <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> and vocalisations. The proposed split was accepted by the <a href="Association%20of%20European%20Rarities%20Committees">Association of European Rarities Committees</a> (AERC) in 2003, although some authorities, like "<a href="The%20Clements%20checklist%20of%20birds%20of%20the%20world">The Clements checklist</a>", have not yet recognised the new species.

The <a href="flamecrest">flamecrest</a> or Taiwan firecrest ("Regulus goodfellowi") of Taiwan has sometimes been viewed as a race of the common firecrest; however, the flamecrest's territorial song, which resembles those of the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayan</a> races of the goldcrest, and genetic data indicate that the flamecrest is closely related to the Himalayan goldcrest and only distantly to the two firecrest species. The kinglets on the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>, which were also considered to be close to firecrests, have now been shown to comprise two subspecies of goldcrest.

There are a few <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago) records from Europe and Israel of extant "Regulus" species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species, but also a Spanish specimen of firecrest. A left <a href="ulna">ulna</a> from Bulgaria was identified as belonging to a fossil species, "<a href="Regulus%20bulgaricus">Regulus bulgaricus</a>", from 2.6–1.95 <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>. This appears to be ancestral to the common firecrest, with the goldcrest diverging from this lineage in the Middle Pleistocene.

The common firecrest breeds in lowland <a href="Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forests">broadleaf forest</a>, preferring <a href="Quercus%20suber">cork oak</a> and <a href="alder">alder</a> where available, otherwise <a href="beech">beech</a> and <a href="holly">holly</a>. It also uses mixed broadleaf and <a href="pinophyta">conifer</a> woodland, and stands of <a href="spruce">spruce</a>, <a href="abies%20alba">European silver fir</a>, <a href="Cedrus">cedar</a> and <a href="pine">pine</a>s, often with undergrowth of <a href="juniper">juniper</a>, <a href="ivy">ivy</a> and wild <a href="rose">rose</a>. In drier <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> habitats it is found in conifers, evergreen oak, and mixed woodlands up to . Unlike more specialised birds such as <a href="Eurasian%20nuthatch">Eurasian nuthatch</a> and <a href="Eurasian%20treecreeper">common treecreeper</a>, both of which forage on trunks, the crests do not need large woodlands, and their population density is independent of forest size. In winter it is less reliant on conifers than the goldcrest, moving from forest to fringes and scrub. It occurs singly or in pairs, spending much time in the tree canopy, although frequently venturing into bushes and other lower vegetation. This species can thrive in fairly urban areas, provided that suitable habitat is available in parks or large gardens; population densities in gardens can be comparable with the maximum levels found in natural habitats.

The nominate subspecies breeds in Europe from southern England, France, Spain and Portugal east to Belarus, northwestern Ukraine, and Greece, and north to the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> and southern Latvia. There are isolated populations east of the main range in <a href="Abkhazia">Abkhazia</a>, the <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a> and Turkey. Its range lies between the July <a href="contour%20line">isotherms</a>. Southern birds are largely resident, unlike northern and eastern populations which are <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering mainly in Mediterranean areas and the far west of Europe from Portugal north to Britain. "R. i. balearicus" is resident in the Balearic Islands and the northern parts of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. This species has been recorded as a <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> from Norway, Finland, Estonia, Cyprus, Egypt and Lebanon.

The common firecrest is <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>. The male sings during the breeding season, often with its crest raised, and has a <a href="display%20%28zoology%29">display</a> which involves pointing its bill at another bird, showing the crest and strong face pattern. This differs from the display of the plainer-faced goldcrest, which bows its head to emphasise the crest. The breeding territory is about , and may overlap with neighbouring goldcrest territories. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests with the crest raised and a great deal of wing-fluttering, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between the species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two kinglets learned to ignore each other's songs. In his courtship display the male firecrest raises his crest, points it towards his mate and hovers over her before mating takes place.

The nest is often suspended from a hanging branch usually at no great altitude, although <a href="Eric%20Simms%20%28ornithologist%29">Eric Simms</a> reported nests at heights from . Firecrests may favour breeding close to <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a> nests. That large bird will prey on potential predators of the firecrest such as <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a>s, and nest robbers like <a href="eastern%20grey%20squirrel">grey squirrel</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20jay">Eurasian jay</a>s and <a href="great%20spotted%20woodpecker">great spotted woodpecker</a>s. As is typical for the family, the <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a> is a closed cup built in three layers with a small entrance hole near its top. The nest's outer layer is made from moss, small twigs, cobwebs and lichen, the spider webs also being used to attach the nest to the thin branches that support it. The middle layer is moss, and this is lined with feathers (up to 3,000) and hair. The nest is smaller, deeper and more compact than that of the goldcrest, about across and deep, with a wall thickness of about . The nest is constructed by the female alone, although the male will accompany the female while she builds the nest over a period of a few days to three weeks.

Laying starts in western Europe at the end of April, and in the east of the range in late May; second <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutches</a>, which are common, commence in June to July. The eggs are pink with very indistinct reddish markings at the broad end, unlike those of Madeira firecrest which are described as like those of a "<a href="Leaf-warbler">Phylloscopus</a>" warbler (white with some brown speckles). The eggs are and weigh , of which 5% is shell. The clutch size in Europe is 7–12 eggs, but probably smaller in northwest Africa. The female incubates the eggs for 14.5 to 16.5 days to hatching, and broods the chicks, which <a href="fledge">fledge</a> eight to ten days later. Both parents feed the chicks and fledged young. This species becomes sexually mature after one year, and has a life expectancy of less than two years.

Although their ranges overlap substantially, <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridisation</a> between goldcrests and firecrests seems to be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, and appeared to be poorly adapted compared to the parent species.

All species of kinglet are almost exclusively <a href="insectivore">insectivorous</a>, preying on small <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s with soft <a href="cuticle">cuticle</a>s, such as <a href="springtail">springtail</a>s, <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s and spiders. They also feed on the <a href="Pupa%23Cocoon">cocoon</a>s and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will hover to catch flying insects. Although the similarly sized firecrest and goldcrest are often found together, there are a number of factors that reduce direct competition for food. Common firecrests prefer larger prey than goldcrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large <a href="orb-weaver%20spider">orb-web spider</a>s (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).

The common firecrest feeds in trees, exploiting mainly the upper surface of branches in <a href="pinophyta">conifer</a>ous habitat and of leaves in deciduous trees. This is in contrast to the goldcrest, which frequently feeds on the undersides of branches and leaves. In winter, flocks of common firecrests cover a given distance about three times faster than do goldcrests, and ignore the smallest prey items preferred by their relative; large invertebrates are killed by beating them repeatedly against a branch. The differences in behaviour are facilitated by subtle morphological differences; firecrests have broader bills with longer <a href="feather">rictal bristle</a>s (which protect a bird's eye from food items it is trying to capture), and these features reflect the larger prey taken by the species. The firecrest's less forked tail may reflect its longer episodes of hovering while hunting. Firecrests forage more often while standing, and have a foot better adapted for perching, whereas the goldcrest's longer hind toe reflects its habit of moving vertically along branches while feeding. It also has a deep grooves in the soles of its feet capable of gripping individual needles, while firecrests have a smoother underside to the foot.

Young common firecrests are fed almost exclusively with springtails; larger food items are not accepted, and spiders are occasionally regurgitated. From the fifth day onwards, the nestling diet includes aphids and a high amount of snail shells, the latter being needed for bone growth. After the second week, the food includes larger moths and caterpillars, as well as various arthropods typically avoided by adults, such as <a href="Opiliones">harvestmen</a>, <a href="earwig">earwig</a>s, and <a href="centipede">centipede</a>s.

In winter, the firecrest joins loose flocks of other wanderers such as <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">tits</a> and warblers. This kinglet, like other species that prefer <a href="mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species foraging flock</a>s in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds. In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables for fatty food, sometimes with goldcrests or warblers such as the <a href="common%20chiffchaff">common chiffchaff</a> and <a href="blackcap">blackcap</a>. The kinglet's digestive system is adapted to an entirely insectivorous diet, whereas "<a href="typical%20warbler">Sylvia</a>" warblers include fruit in their autumn diet. A Spanish study compared that genus with the insectivorous firecrest and "<a href="Leaf-warbler">Phylloscopus</a>" warblers. The results showed that, relative to body weight, the insect-eaters had shorter intestines, but longer gut passage times than the "Sylvia" species. The insect-eaters are also generally slightly smaller than the <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>s.

The <a href="Bird%20vocalization">contact call</a> is three or four thin high notes, similar to that of <a href="goldcrest">goldcrest</a>, but slightly lower in pitch, "zit-zit-zit" rather than "see-see-see". The song is a succession of call notes in a longer and slightly more varied sequence. Typically there are 11–14 notes per song, becoming louder and faster, with the final three notes slightly different from the preceding ones: "zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zirt.zirt.zirt". The song usually lasts 0.5–2.5 seconds, shorter than the 3.5–4.0 seconds for the goldcrest, and may be repeated up to eight times a minute. In May and June, singing is most frequent after dawn, but continues less often throughout the day. Later in the breeding season, song becomes largely confined to the morning.

The song of the Mediterranean subspecies of common firecrest, "R. i. balearicus", is very similar to that of the <a href="Subspecies%23Nomenclature">nominate</a> form, but one factor in separating the Madeiran firecrest from common firecrest is that the island bird's song is divided into three phrases, two of them consisting of modified display and anger calls. Its display calls also use a larger frequency range and more <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a>s than those of the continental subspecies. Male goldcrests and Madeiran firecrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common firecrest, but the reverse is apparently not true, because the songs of the common firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.

Throughout the firecrest's range, the main predator of small woodland birds is the Eurasian sparrowhawk, which takes avian prey as up to 98% of its diet. The <a href="tawny%20owl">tawny owl</a> relies more on mammalian catches, but about one-third of its food is forest birds. Eggs and young may be taken by grey squirrels, Eurasian jays and great spotted woodpeckers. The firecrest appears to be virtually unknown as a <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> of the <a href="common%20cuckoo">common cuckoo</a>, a widespread European <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>.

The invasive <a href="Argentine%20ant">Argentine ant</a> ("Linepithema humile") is common in the Mediterranean area, and reduces <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a> numbers by removing most native ant species. The reduction in prey items is greatest in the tree canopy, and has a greater effect on species like the firecrest that feed high in the foliage. Less food is available for chicks, and parents have to spend more time foraging.

Data on specific parasites of the firecrest is lacking, but the widespread <a href="moorhen%20flea">moorhen flea</a>, "Dasypsyllus gallinulae" has been recorded in a related "Regulus" species. A number of <a href="feather%20mite">feather mite</a>s have been recorded in the genus, including "Proctophyllodes glandarinus" on firecrest. These mites live on fungi growing on the feathers. The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the <a href="keratin">keratin</a> of the outer feathers or on feather oil.

The common firecrest expanded its range in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, colonising northern France, followed by first breeding in the Netherlands in 1928 and Denmark in 1961. In Britain, it had only been recorded a handful of times by 1839, but first bred in 1962, and is now widespread as a breeding bird in much of southern England. Milder winters have meant that more birds can winter further north, and therefore the breeding range can expand without incurring the risks involved in lengthy migrations. A population was found in northern Morocco in 1986.

Population growth may be limited by lack of suitable habitat, and there may be local declines due to loss of conifers through storms or replacement by plantations of native deciduous trees. There may also be localised losses in areas of high <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metal</a> pollution, which particularly affects ground feeders like <a href="thrush%20%28bird%29">thrushes</a> and conifer foliage gleaners, including both European "Regulus" species. Conifer specialists suffer from the loss and poor quality of needles, and the consequent decrease in abundance of their <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> food. The common firecrest has a large range and a population estimated at 10–30 million individuals, most in Europe. The population is believed to be stable in the absence of evidence for any declines or serious threats, and it is therefore classed as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

<a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a> relate the legend of a contest amongst the birds to see who should be their king, the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest. Initially, it looked as though the eagle would win easily, but as he began to tire, a small bird which had hidden under the eagle's tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title. Following from this legend, in much European folklore the <a href="Eurasian%20wren">wren</a> has been described as the "king of the birds" or as a flame bearer. However, these terms were also applied to the "Regulus" species, the fiery crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles, and, because of the legend's reference to the "smallest of birds" becoming king, the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny wren. The confusion was assisted by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words for the wren (βασιλεύς "basileus", "king") and the crests (βασιλισκος "basiliskos", "kinglet"). In English, the association between the firecrest and Eurasian wren was reinforced by the kinglet's old name of "fire-crested wren".

Riven

Riven is a <a href="Adventure%20game%23Puzzle%20adventure">puzzle adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> and the sequel to "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>". Developed by <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a>, it was initially published by <a href="Red%20Orb%20Entertainment">Red Orb Entertainment</a>, a division of <a href="Br%C3%B8derbund">Brøderbund</a>. "Riven" was distributed on five compact discs and released on October 31, 1997, in North America; it was later released on a single DVD-ROM, with improved audio and a fourteen-minute "making-of" video. In addition to the PC versions, "Riven" has been <a href="Porting">ported</a> to several other platforms.

The story of "Riven" is set immediately after the events of "Myst". Having been rescued from the efforts of his sons, the main non-player protagonist <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Atrus">Atrus</a> enlists the help of the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> to free his wife from his power-hungry father, <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Gehn">Gehn</a>. Unlike "Myst", which took place on several worlds known as Ages linked together by special books, "Riven" takes place almost entirely on the Age of Riven, a world slowly falling apart due to Gehn's destructive rule.

Development of "Riven" began soon after "Myst" became a success, and spanned more than three years. In an effort to create a visual style distinct from that of "Myst", director <a href="Robyn%20Miller">Robyn Miller</a> and his brother, producer <a href="Rand%20Miller">Rand Miller</a> recruited former "<a href="Aladdin%20%281992%20Disney%20film%29">Aladdin</a>" <a href="production%20designer">production designer</a> <a href="Richard%20Vander%20Wende">Richard Vander Wende</a> as a co-director. Brøderbund employed a <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>10 million advertising campaign to publicize the game's release.

"Riven" was praised by reviewers, with the magazine "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>" proclaiming that the game approaches the level of art. Critics positively noted the puzzles and immersive experience of the gameplay, though publications such as "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" felt that the nature of point-and-click gameplay limited the title heavily. The best-selling <a href="1997%20in%20video%20gaming">game of 1997</a>, "Riven" sold 1.5 million copies in one year. After the game's release, Robyn Miller left Cyan to form his own development studio, ending the professional partnership of the two brothers. Rand stayed at Cyan and continued to work on "Myst"-related products including "<a href="The%20Myst%20Reader">The Myst Reader</a>" and the real-time rendered game "". The next entry in the "Myst" series, "", was developed by <a href="Presto%20Studios">Presto Studios</a> and published by <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>.

Like its predecessor, "Riven" is a <a href="point%20and%20click">point and click</a> adventure game played from a <a href="first-person%20narrative">first-person</a> perspective. The player explores immersive environments depicted through a large series of <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer generated stills</a> using mouse clicks for movement or to manipulate objects within reach. By operating mechanical contraptions and deciphering codes and symbols discovered in the surroundings, the vaguely explained goal can eventually be reached.

To navigate the world, the player simply clicks in the direction they want to walk or turn. The cursor changes in appearance, depending on its position on the screen and what it is hovering over, to show what effect clicking will have. For instance, if the player positions the cursor hand near the side of the screen, it may show a pointing finger, indicating that clicking will turn the view in that direction. The cursor also changes in context to show when players can drag or toggle switches, or when certain <a href="Item%20%28gaming%29%23Items%20in%20adventure%20games">item</a>s can be picked up and carried. Such items can then be examined at any time, and either reveal clues to puzzles or provide information on the game's setting and story. Like "Myst", "Riven" has an optional method of navigation known as "Zip Mode", which allows players to skip to areas already explored, but may cause them to miss important clues.

"Riven" has more complex and numerous <a href="Adventure%20game%23Puzzle-solving">puzzles</a> than its forerunner and is set in a larger virtual world for players to explore. Whereas in "Myst" the objective of the game is to travel to different Ages to solve puzzles before returning to a "hub Age", "Riven"s gameplay takes place on the five islands of the Age of Riven. Much of it consists of solving puzzles to access new areas of the islands, though players are also able to explore without fulfilling objectives. The volcanic landscape depicted, with its steep cliffs and <a href="crater%20lake">crater lake</a>s, is bestrewn with mechanical, Victorian-style artifacts such as elevators, pipes, levers and roller coaster-like transports. To solve the game, players must consider the purpose and physical principles of these artifacts as well as their role in the fictional culture.

"Riven"s story continues where "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" and its companion novel, "<a href="The%20Myst%20Reader%23Book%20of%20Atrus">The Book of Atrus</a>", left off. The player assumes the role of the Stranger, the protagonist of the first game and friend of Atrus (<a href="Rand%20Miller">Rand Miller</a>). Atrus knows the ancient art of creating "linking books", specially written books that serve as <a href="portals%20in%20fiction">portals</a> to other worlds known as "Ages". Atrus needs the Stranger's help to free his wife, <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Atrus%20and%20Catherine">Catherine</a> (Sheila Goold; voice by Rengin Altay), who is held hostage in her home Age of Riven, which is slowly collapsing. Her captor is Gehn (<a href="John%20Keston">John Keston</a>), Atrus' manipulative father and self-declared ruler of Riven. Thirty years earlier, Atrus and Catherine trapped Gehn on Riven by removing all of the linking books that led out of the Age; the very last book to be removed, linking to the Age of Myst, was the one they held to escape Riven. In the belief that it would be destroyed, they let the book fall into the Star Fissure, a rift leading out of the damaged Age of Riven into a mysterious, <a href="Wormholes%20in%20fiction">space-like void</a>. Catherine was later tricked into returning to Riven by her sons, <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Sirrus%20and%20Achenar">Sirrus and Achenar</a>, whereupon she was taken hostage by Gehn. Eventually, the player discovered the unharmed Myst book, leading to the events in "Myst".

At the beginning of "Riven", Atrus equips the player with a trap book — a snare that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book — and his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the present situation; Atrus cannot explain in depth as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, in an attempt to slow its deterioration. The player must enter the Age with no way of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned lest he use it to escape Riven. Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus holds out the link book that will transport the player to Riven.

Once there, the player explores the islands of Riven, eventually discovering Catherine's prison. The player also travels to Tay, the Age of the Moiety (rebellious Rivenese under the leadership of Catherine who are attempting to end Gehn's tyrannical rule), and the "233rd Age", Gehn's personal sanctuary, where the player meets Gehn himself. Gehn attempts to convince the player that his intentions to rebuild D'ni (the civilization responsible for originating the art of the link books) were honorable and that he seeks atonement for his past transgressions. Because of the decay of Riven's structure, the only way to clearly signal Atrus is to bring about a massive disturbance in the Age's stability — accomplished by reopening the Star Fissure, which Gehn had closed. When it opens, Atrus immediately links to Riven to investigate and meets the player at the brink of the Fissure. Depending on the player's actions, the ending to "Riven" <a href="alternate%20ending">varies</a>. In the best ending, the player tricks Gehn into the prison book and releases Catherine. Atrus and Catherine thank the Stranger before linking back to the Age of Myst. The Stranger then falls into the Star Fissure to be taken on the path back to his world. The worst ending involves neither capturing Gehn nor releasing Catherine, which allows Gehn to kill Atrus (and then the player) and escape from his imprisonment. Other endings include capturing Gehn without saving Catherine, being trapped in the prison book, or even death.

Cyan began work on "Riven" <a href="1993%20in%20video%20gaming">in 1993</a>, immediately after "Myst"s release. Before development began, when even the name of the game was undecided, the brothers <a href="Robyn%20Miller">Robyn</a> and <a href="Rand%20Miller">Rand Miller</a> said they wanted a "natural flow" from the first game to the sequel. As "Myst" proved to be a popular and commercial success, the two developers were able to expand their four-person team to a much larger crew of designers, artists, programmers, and sound designers. Development spanned more than four years, and was a much larger undertaking than for the first game; "Riven" had a budget of between <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>5 and $10 million, more than ten times the cost of developing "Myst". Prior to release, <a href="Atari%20Corporation">Atari Corporation</a> were in talks with <a href="Sunsoft">Sunsoft</a>, who previously published "Myst" to the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> in regards for a potential conversion of "Riven" to the <a href="Atari%20Jaguar">Atari Jaguar</a> that never materialized.

The design for "Riven" stemmed from a desire to create something different and more dynamic than the <a href="Romanticism">romantic</a> style of "Myst". At an early point, the game's world was to be called "Equiquay". The first stage of development was to create the puzzles, in an attempt to integrate them as smoothly as possible into the areas in the game. The Millers met their co-designer, <a href="Richard%20Vander%20Wende">Richard Vander Wende</a>, at a demonstration of "Myst" for the Digital World Expo in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Vander Wende had previously worked for <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">ILM</a>, and at <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> as a designer for the animated feature "<a href="Aladdin%20%281992%20Disney%20film%29">Aladdin</a>". As the third member of "Riven"s conceptual team, Vander Wende ended up contributing what Robyn Miller described as an "edgier" and complementary vision, that made the game dramatically different than its predecessor.

At the time of "Riven"s development, publisher <a href="Br%C3%B8derbund">Brøderbund</a> was facing falling revenues as development costs rose. Two years into the project, Cyan still had nothing they could show them. Brøderbund's stock dropped from $60 a share to $22 <a href="1996%20in%20video%20gaming">in 1996</a>, because of a delay in the publishing of "Riven". The plan had been to ship the game in time for the 1996 holiday season; "Riven" was finally published on October 29, 1997. Even though "Riven"s sales were expected to be higher than any other game that holiday season, Brøderbund launched a $10 million marketing campaign and developed a retail marketing partnership with <a href="Toshiba">Toshiba</a> America. Anticipation for the game was high even among non-gamers, helped by web-based word of mouth and well-placed media coverage.

As in "Myst", the topology of the islands was originally created as grayscale images, where brightness corresponded to elevation. In <a href="Autodesk%20Softimage">Softimage</a>, these maps were turned into the terrain models seen in the game. The large island objects were broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, which required them to be created using polygonal geometry. All other objects were modeled using <a href="B-spline">B-spline</a>s and <a href="Nonuniform%20rational%20B-spline">NURBS</a>.

Many of the <a href="texture%20mapping">textures</a> were accumulated during a three-day trip to <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a>. The artists took hundreds of photos of wood, adobe, sand, stucco and other materials, which were treated in <a href="Photoshop">Photoshop</a> before being mapped onto the <a href="3D%20modeling">3D geometry</a>. Whereas many <a href="computer%20graphics">computer-generated</a> environments of the time ended up looking smooth, like plastic, the Millers and Vander Wende developed a more gritty and weathered design, with corroded and aged elements, to imply reality. The artists considered how objects would look and function if they were real, where and how they would be worn, and created corresponding details. While <a href="bump%20map">bump map</a>s were occasionally used to simulate geometry, even small details such as screws were often individually modeled.

Rendering was executed in <a href="Mental%20Ray">Mental Ray</a>, using numerous custom-made <a href="shader">shader</a>s to produce lifelike lighting, water and landscapes. <a href="Wire-frame%20model">Wireframes</a> also served as a guide to model the backgrounds. In total "Riven" has over three hours of video and almost five thousand images; rendering was a major bottleneck in production despite the use of 18 dedicated <a href="workstation">workstation</a>s. Some scenes consisted of tens of thousands of individual models and textures and more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours. Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water ripples.

"Riven" combined the pre-rendered backgrounds with <a href="live%20action">live action</a> footage, in order to increase the player's immersion level. "Riven" was the first game in which any of its designers had directed live actors, and Vander Wende was apprehensive about their use. Rand Miller had to reprise his role of <a href="Atrus">Atrus</a> from "Myst", even though he hated acting. All the actors were filmed with a blue screen as a backdrop, which was removed in post-production by <a href="chroma%20key">chroma key</a>, so that the actors would blend into the virtual environment. Real world stairs, doorways and studio lights had to be meticulously positioned on the live stage to match their CG equivalents. Some sequences were seamlessly cut together with <a href="morphing">morphing</a>, to allow for partial variations due to the <a href="Linearity%20%28video%20games%29">nonlinearity</a> of the gameplay.

Robyn Miller composed "Riven"s music, which was later packaged and released by <a href="Virgin%20Records">Virgin Records</a> as "Riven: The Soundtrack". Miller designed the liner notes and packaging, which included English translations of the <a href="Constructed%20language">language found in the game</a>. Whereas the music to "Myst" was, at first, only available by mail-order from Cyan, Virgin Records had bought the rights to release it initially, prompting Miller to make sure that it could stand alone in CD form. The compact disc was released on February 24, 1998, with 54 minutes of music.

Miller established three <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s for the game's three central characters, Atrus, Catherine, and Gehn. Gehn's theme is only heard in its complete form near the end of the game, but portions of the melody can be heard throughout Riven, highlighting his control of the Age. Miller tried to let the environment dictate the resulting sound in order to make the music as immersive as possible. He blended live instrumentation with <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s: "By mixing and matching conventional instrumentation, you can create an odd, interesting mood," Miller said. Ultimately, he wanted the music of "Riven" to reflect the game itself, which he described as having "a familiar-yet-strange feel to it."

Miller described his biggest challenge in writing "Riven"s music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the <a href="Linearity%20%28video%20games%29">nonlinearity</a> of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, "the music can't say anything too specific. If it says something, if it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, and people are just standing in a room looking around, and they're thinking 'What's going on in here? Is something about to jump out from behind me?' You can't have the basic parts of music that you'd like to have, you can't have a basic structure. It's all got to be just flowing, and continue to flow." <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> critic <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> argued that the soundtrack is "appealingly atmospheric", but "lacks definition", and that the music loses impact when separated from the game.
"Riven" was generally positively received by critics, with the PC version garnering an average critic score of 83/100 at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. The game sold more than 1.5 million units within a year of its release, and was the best-selling game of 1997, despite having only been on the market for less than three months. By 2001, over 4.5 million units had been sold.
Jeff Segstack of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> gave the game high marks, explaining that it is "a leisurely paced, all-encompassing, mentally challenging experience. If you enjoyed "Myst", you'll thoroughly enjoy "Riven"." "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" stated that the graphics were the best they had seen in any adventure game. Laura Miller of "<a href="Salon%20%28magazine%29">Salon</a>" declared that "Art [...] is what "Riven" approaches," and praised the gameplay as having "a graceful elegance that reminds [her] of a masterfully constructed novel." The game's sound and graphics were consistently praised. "<a href="Macworld">Macworld</a>"s Michael Gowan highlighted the game's "rich, engrossingly mysterious world", and he argued that the quality of its storytelling made "Riven" "more like a good novel than a computer game."

Nevertheless, several publications found fault with aspects of "Riven". "Computer Gaming World" felt that the gameplay was too similar to the original "Myst", making "Riven" the "same game with a new title"; the magazine also criticized the minimal character interaction. Gaming magazine "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" felt that although "Riven" was a good game, the solitary atmosphere and lack of mobility was steadily becoming outdated, as games like "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>" sacrificed graphical fidelity for an increase in freedom. They stated "the question is whether Cyan can incorporate its almost <a href="Tolkien%27s%20legendarium">Tolkien-esque</a> world-building skills into a more cutting-edge game vehicle next time." Even long-time players of the "Myst" games, such as Heidi Fournier of <a href="Adventure%20Gamers">Adventure Gamers</a>, felt that a few puzzles were too difficult; "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>", meanwhile, believed that the story clues were too symbolic and scant, which made following the plot difficult.

Despite the success of the game, the Miller brothers eventually pursued other projects. Robyn Miller said: "I think it would be a detriment to always, for the rest of our lives, be creating "Myst"-like projects. […] We're going to change, evolve and grow, just like any person does in any manner." Robyn would leave Cyan to form a new development company called Land of Point; Vander Wende would also leave to pursue other projects. The next video game entry in the "Myst" franchise would be 2001's "", which was not developed by Cyan nor published by Brøderbund. <a href="Presto%20Studios">Presto Studios</a> took over development; <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> acquired Brøderbund's entertainment library from <a href="The%20Learning%20Company">The Learning Company</a> and published the Myst sequels.

The Long and Winding Road

"The Long and Winding Road" is a song by the English rock band <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> from their 1970 album "<a href="Let%20It%20Be">Let It Be</a>". It was written by <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> and credited to <a href="Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney">Lennon–McCartney</a>. When issued as a single in May 1970, a month after <a href="Break-up%20of%20the%20Beatles">the Beatles' break-up</a>, it became the group's 20th and last number-one hit on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart in the United States. It was the final single released by the quartet.

The main recording of the song took place in January 1969 and featured a sparse musical arrangement. When preparing the tapes from these sessions for release in April 1970, producer <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a> added orchestral and choral overdubs. Spector's modifications angered McCartney to the point that when the latter made his case in the British High Court for the Beatles' dissolution, he cited the treatment of "The Long and Winding Road" as one of six reasons for doing so. New versions of the song with simpler instrumentation were subsequently released by McCartney and by the Beatles.

In 2011, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" ranked "The Long and Winding Road" at number 90 on their list of 100 greatest Beatles songs.

Paul McCartney said he came up with the title "The Long and Winding Road" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near <a href="Campbeltown">Campbeltown</a> in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road "stretching up into the hills" in the remote <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Highlands</a> surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles.<ref name="Merritt/SH"></ref> Based on other comments McCartney has made, author <a href="Howard%20Sounes">Howard Sounes</a> writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: "I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a>. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration."

Once back in London, McCartney recorded a <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo version</a> of "The Long and Winding Road" during one of the recording sessions for "<a href="The%20Beatles%20%28album%29">The Beatles</a>". Later, he offered the song to <a href="Tom%20Jones%20%28singer%29">Tom Jones</a> on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue "<a href="Without%20Love%20%28Clyde%20McPhatter%20song%29">Without Love</a>" as a single.

The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as "slightly jazzy" and in keeping with Charles' style.<ref name="Duca/HuffPost"></ref> The song's home <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> is <a href="E-flat%20major">E-flat major</a> but it also uses the relative C minor.<ref name="Pollack/Notes"></ref> Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love.

In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: "It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a <a href="psychiatry">psychiatrist</a>."

The opening theme is repeated throughout. The song lacks a traditional chorus, and the melody and lyrics are ambiguous about the opening stanza's position in the song; it is unclear whether the song has just begun, is in the verse, or is in the bridge.

The Beatles recorded several takes of "The Long and Winding Road" at their <a href="Apple%20Studio">Apple Studio</a> in central London on 26 January 1969 and again on 31 January. The line-up on the track was McCartney on lead vocals and piano, <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> on <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a>, <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a> on <a href="electric%20guitar">electric guitar</a>, <a href="Ringo%20Starr">Ringo Starr</a> on <a href="drum%20kit">drums</a>, and guest keyboardist <a href="Billy%20Preston">Billy Preston</a> on <a href="Rhodes%20piano">Rhodes piano</a>. This was during a series of sessions for an album and film project then known as "Get Back". Lennon, usually the band's rhythm guitarist, played bass only occasionally and made several mistakes on the recording.

In May 1969, <a href="Glyn%20Johns">Glyn Johns</a>, who had been asked by the Beatles to compile and mix the "Get Back" album, selected the 26 January recording. Since the song had been deemed unsuitable for inclusion in the band's filmed rooftop concert on 30 January, the Beatles also taped a master version of "The Long and Winding Road" at Apple the following day. This 31 January version, which had slightly different lyrics from the released take, and was recorded with Johns in an unofficial producer's role, was used in the film, subsequently titled "Let It Be". For the 1969 and 1970 versions of the "Get Back" album – both of which were rejected by the Beatles – Johns used the 26 January mix as released on the "<a href="Anthology%203">Anthology 3</a>" album in 1996.

In early 1970, Lennon and the Beatles' manager, <a href="Allen%20Klein">Allen Klein</a>, turned over the recordings to American producer <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a> with the hope of salvaging an album, which was then titled "Let It Be". McCartney had become estranged from his bandmates at this time, due to his opposition to Klein's appointment as manager. Several weeks were lost before McCartney replied to messages requesting his approval for Spector to begin working on the recordings. Spector chose to return to the same 26 January recording of "The Long and Winding Road".

Spector made various changes to the songs. His most dramatic embellishments occurred on 1 April 1970, the last ever Beatles recording session, when he added orchestral overdubs to "The Long and Winding Road", "<a href="Across%20the%20Universe">Across the Universe</a>" and "<a href="I%20Me%20Mine">I Me Mine</a>" at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a>. The only member of the Beatles present was Starr, who played drums with the session musicians to create Spector's characteristic "<a href="Wall%20of%20Sound">Wall of Sound</a>". Already known for his eccentric behaviour in the studio, Spector was in a peculiar mood that day, according to balance engineer Peter Bown: "He wanted tape echo on everything, he had to take a different pill every half hour and had his bodyguard with him constantly. He was on the point of throwing a wobbly, saying 'I want to hear this, I want to hear that. I must have this, I must have that.'" The orchestra became so annoyed by Spector's behaviour that the musicians refused to play any further; at one point, Bown left for home, forcing Spector to telephone him and persuade him to come back after Starr had told Spector to calm down.

Spector succeeded in <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a> "The Long and Winding Road", using eight <a href="violin">violin</a>s, four <a href="viola">viola</a>s, four <a href="cello">cello</a>s, three <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>s, three <a href="trombone">trombone</a>s, two guitars, and a choir of 14 women. The orchestra was scored and conducted by <a href="Richard%20Anthony%20Hewson">Richard Hewson</a>, a young London <a href="arranger">arranger</a> who had worked with Apple artists <a href="Mary%20Hopkin">Mary Hopkin</a> and <a href="James%20Taylor">James Taylor</a>. This lush orchestral treatment was in direct contrast to the Beatles' stated intentions for a "real" recording when they began work on "Get Back".

On 2 April, Spector sent each of the Beatles an acetate of the completed album with a note saying: "If there is anything you'd like done to the album, let me know and I'll be glad to help ... If you wish, please call me about anything regarding the album tonight." All four of the band members sent him their approval by telegram.

According to author <a href="Peter%20Doggett">Peter Doggett</a>, McCartney had felt the need to accommodate his bandmates when accepting Spector's version of "Let It Be"; but, following his announcement of <a href="the%20Beatles%27%20break-up">the Beatles' break-up</a> in a press release accompanying the release of his solo album, "<a href="McCartney%20%28album%29">McCartney</a>", on 9 April, he repeatedly listened again to "The Long and Winding Road" and came to resent Spector's additions. On 14 April, with manufacturing underway for "Let It Be", he sent a terse letter to Klein, demanding that the <a href="harp">harp</a> be removed from the song and that the other added instrumentation and voices be reduced. McCartney concluded the letter with the words: "Don't ever do it again." Klein attempted to phone McCartney but he had changed his number without informing Apple; Klein then sent a telegram asking McCartney to contact him or Spector about his concerns. According to Klein, "The following day, a message was relayed to me [from McCartney] that the letter spoke for itself." With "Let It Be" scheduled for release in advance of the similarly titled documentary film, Klein allowed the production process to continue with Spector's version of "The Long and Winding Road" intact.

In an interview published by the "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>" in two parts on 22 and 23 April 1970, McCartney said: "The album was finished a year ago, but a few months ago American record producer Phil Spector was called in by Lennon to tidy up some of the tracks. But a few weeks ago, I was sent a re-mixed version of my song 'The Long and Winding Road' with harps, <a href="French%20horn">horn</a>s, an orchestra, and a women's choir added. No one had asked me what I thought. I couldn't believe it." The Beatles' usual producer, <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a>, called the remixes "so uncharacteristic" of the Beatles, while Johns, who was denied a production credit by Lennon, described Spector's embellishments as "revolting ... just puke".

McCartney asked Klein to dissolve the Beatles' partnership, but was refused. Exasperated, he took the case to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a> in London in early 1971, naming Klein and the other Beatles as defendants. Among the six reasons McCartney gave for dissolving the Beatles was that Klein's company, <a href="ABKCO%20Records">ABKCO</a>, had caused "intolerable interference" by overdubbing "The Long and Winding Road" without consulting McCartney. In his written affidavit, Starr countered this statement by saying that when Spector had sent acetates of "Let It Be" to each of the Beatles for their approval, with a request also for feedback: "We all said yes. Even at the beginning Paul said yes. I spoke to him on the phone, and said, 'Did you like it?' and he said, 'Yeah, it's OK.' He didn't put it down." Starr added: "And then suddenly he didn't want it to go out. Two weeks after that, he wanted to cancel it."

Speaking shortly after the overdubbing sessions, Spector said that he had asked whether any of the Beatles would like to help him produce the album, but none of them had wanted to.<ref name="Irvin/Mojo"> Available at <a href="https%3A//www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/get-it-better-the-story-of-ilet-it-be-nakedi">Rock's Backpages</a> (subscription required).</ref> He also said that his hand was forced into remixing "The Long and Winding Road" due to the poor quality of Lennon's bass playing. Others agreed: in his book "<a href="Revolution%20in%20the%20Head">Revolution in the Head</a>" Beatles scholar <a href="Ian%20MacDonald">Ian MacDonald</a> wrote: "The song was designed as a standard to be taken up by mainstream balladeers. … It features some atrocious bass-playing by Lennon, prodding clumsily around as if uncertain of the harmonies and making many comical mistakes. Lennon's crude bass playing on 'The Long and Winding Road,' though largely accidental, amounts to sabotage when presented as finished work." Spector said that McCartney was being hypocritical in his criticism: "Paul had no problem picking up the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Academy Award</a> for the "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%28movie%29">Let It Be</a>" movie soundtrack, nor did he have any problem in using my arrangement of the string and horn and choir parts when he performed it during 25 years of touring on his own. If Paul wants to get into a pissing contest about it, he's got me mixed up with someone who gives a shit."

The song was released on the "Let It Be" album on 8 May 1970. On 11 May, seven days before the album's North American release, Apple issued "The Long and Winding Road" as a single in the United States with "<a href="For%20You%20Blue">For You Blue</a>" on the B-side. In the context of the recent news regarding the Beatles' split, the song captured the sadness that many listeners felt.

On 13 June 1970, it became the Beatles' twentieth and final number-one single on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart in America and held the top position for a second week. The band thereby set the all-time record for number of chart-topping singles on the "Billboard" Hot 100. The Beatles achieved this feat in the space of 74 months from their debut US number one, "<a href="I%20Want%20to%20Hold%20Your%20Hand">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>", in February 1964 – an average of one chart-topping single per 3.7 months, another all-time record. The single's contemporary US sales were insufficient for <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America%20certification%23Singles">gold accreditation</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA). In February 1999, the song was certified platinum by the RIAA for sales of 1,000,000.

In 2011, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" placed "The Long and Winding Road" at number 90 on its list of "The 100 Greatest Beatles Songs". On a similar list compiled by "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" in 2006, the song appeared at number 27. In his commentary for the magazine, <a href="Brian%20Wilson">Brian Wilson</a> described it as his "all time favourite Beatles track", saying that while the Beatles were "genius songwriters", this song was distinguished by a ""heart-and-soul" melody". Wilson concluded: "When they broke up I was heartbroken. I think they should have kept going."

Since release in 1970, there have been six additional recordings released by McCartney. The 26 January take, without the orchestration and overdubs, was released on "<a href="Anthology%203">Anthology 3</a>" in 1996. This version included a bridge section spoken, rather than sung, by McCartney that was omitted in Spector's remix.

In 2003, McCartney persuaded Starr and Ono (as Lennon's widow) to release "<a href="Let%20It%20Be...%20Naked">Let It Be... Naked</a>", touted as the band's version of "Let It Be" remixed by independent producers. McCartney claimed that his long-standing dissatisfaction with the released version of "The Long and Winding Road" (and the entire "Let It Be" album) was in part the impetus for the new version. The new album included a later take of "The Long and Winding Road", recorded on 31 January. With no strings or other added instrumentation beyond that which was played in the studio at the time, it was closer to the Beatles's original intention than the 1970 version. This take is also the one seen in the film "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%28film%29">Let It Be</a>" and on the Beatles' 2015 video compilation "<a href="1%20%28Beatles%20album%29">1</a>". Starr said of the "Let It Be... Naked" version: "There's nothing wrong with Phil's strings [on the 1970 release], this is just a different attitude to listening. But it's been 30-odd years since I've heard it without all that and it just blew me away."

McCartney and producer <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a> re-recorded "The Long and Winding Road" with instrumentation incorporating a lead saxophone, for the soundtrack to McCartney's 1984 film, "<a href="Give%20My%20Regards%20to%20Broad%20Street">Give My Regards to Broad Street</a>". A second new studio recording of the song was made by McCartney in 1989 and used as a B-side of single releases from his "<a href="Flowers%20in%20the%20Dirt">Flowers in the Dirt</a>" album, starting with the "Postcard Pack" vinyl format of "<a href="This%20One%20%28song%29">This One</a>".

"The Long and Winding Road" became a staple of McCartney's post-Beatles concert repertoire. On the 1976 <a href="Wings%20Over%20the%20World%20Tour">Wings Over the World Tour</a>, where it was one of the few Beatles songs played, it was performed on piano in a sparse arrangement using a <a href="horn%20section">horn section</a>. On McCartney's <a href="Get%20Back%20World%20Tour">1989 solo tour</a> and since, it has generally been performed on piano with an arrangement using a <a href="synthesiser">synthesiser</a> mimicking strings, but this string sound is more restrained than on the Spector recorded version. The live performance recording of the Rio de Janeiro concert in April 1990 is on the album "<a href="Tripping%20the%20Live%20Fantastic">Tripping the Live Fantastic</a>". McCartney also played the song to close the <a href="Live%208%20concert%2C%20London">Live 8 concert in London</a>.

Several other artists have performed or recorded "The Long and Winding Road". As McCartney had envisaged, Ray Charles recorded a cover version, which was released on his 2006 album "<a href="Ray%20Sings%2C%20Basie%20Swings">Ray Sings, Basie Swings</a>". In the US, a recording by <a href="Billy%20Ocean">Billy Ocean</a> peaked at number 24 on "Billboard"s <a href="Adult%20Contemporary%20%28chart%29">Adult Contemporary</a> chart. Other versions include a 1999 <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> performance by <a href="George%20Michael">George Michael</a>, a 1977 single release by <a href="Melba%20Moore">Melba Moore</a>, a 1978 recording by <a href="Peter%20Frampton">Peter Frampton</a>, and a 2010 performance at the White House by <a href="Faith%20Hill">Faith Hill</a> when <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> gave McCartney the <a href="Gershwin%20Prize">Gershwin Prize</a>. In 2002, British <a href="Pop%20Idol%20%28series%201%29">Pop Idol series one</a> contestants <a href="Will%20Young">Will Young</a> and <a href="Gareth%20Gates">Gareth Gates</a> recorded a version released as a double A-side with Gates' version of "<a href="Suspicious%20Minds%23Gareth%20Gates%20version">Suspicious Minds</a>"; the single peaked atop the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> and the <a href="Scottish%20Singles%20and%20Albums%20Charts">Scottish Singles Chart</a>. The duet by itself also reached number four in Ireland. In 2007, "The Long and Winding Road" was included on <a href="Barry%20Manilow">Barry Manilow</a>'s "<a href="The%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20the%20Seventies">The Greatest Songs of the Seventies</a>" album that debuted at Number 4 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">Billboard 200</a> chart.
